2,"May 10, 2020","Over the weekend, I purchased a certified XJ from this dealership. Here are the people I dealt with.

Sales Consultant - Tommy Phan
Sales Manager - Rick Bayon
Finance - Jeremy Heuss

Summary- maybe my experience from other luxury dealers is the reason I expected a better experience. This experience felt more like a Kia dealership. Agreed to a reasonable price, but wasted a lot of my time. Tommy needs a LOT more training. Rick needs some training on customer service, and Jeremy was a pleasure to deal with. 3 stars only because of Jeremy. If it wasn't for him, this would be a 1 star experience. 

Full story- This is my 7th car in the past 7 years, so this is not my first rodeo. I visited the store on Friday, and test drove the car. Tommy was polite, but not very knowledgeable. I had a feeling he must have been a new hire. One thing I hate the most, is false information, and improper communication. I offered Tommy the price I want, he took about 30-40mins to appraise my trade and ""work numbers"", and then comes and tells me that it will take another 3-4 hours to get numbers, and he will give me a call. I immediately realized he is either not familiar with negotiating, or doesn't want to negotiate. 

I left, and proceeded to exchange emails with Rick. After a few emails, we agreed on a price. I agreed to go in first thing Saturday morning. I told Rick I can provide any and all information needed, in order for me to spend as much less time as possible at the dealership. I've bought cars at other dealerships without spending more than 30-45mins. They would have all the paperwork, and the car ready to go by the time I got to the dealership.

I get to this dealership, Saturday morning at 9:15am. And I left at 12:15pm. Nothing was ready. Car was dirty, paperwork was not put together. Tommy, probably didn't know what he was doing, and went back and forth a couple of times. Rick never showed his face once, or came out to say hi. He used Tommy as a middleman for communication for any questions I had. The dealership was not even busy, and after hours of waiting I was handed over to Jeremy in finance. I probably spent 15mins max with Jeremy. He was very easy to talk to, and deal with. I would definitely recommend him, if you get to choose your finance guy. 

Back on the sales floor, salesmen got together at one person's desk to chat, and had their masks off. Social distancing was not being followed on the sales floor, or in some sales manager offices. ",3.0

5,"December 09, 2019","If integrity and honesty is what you are looking for...then this is not the place.  After trying to purchase a car long distance, we found honesty to be lacking.  It was a lot of run around language.  You can't finance outside Land rover. Or their policy makes it very difficult.  I feel if we had any other salesman we would have a Range Rover for our daughter. Oh well.  She is now going to be driving a BMW from Carvana.  What a great way to purchase a vehicle.  Plus we get to try it free for 7 days.  You better up your game Land Rover.  A new way to purchase a vehicle is taking over.  Suggestion: Just be honest have integrity instead of greed and don't treat people like they are idiots.  ",1.0

Thanks again Aaron and Land Rover Dallas!

He went out of his was to find the car I wanted instead of pushing me to order (which I was not comfortable with) and made me an amazing deal. He provided a no pressure, no hassle approach and was so patient with all my questions and visits while trying to determine what I wanted. Love my new car!",5.0

10,"February 18, 2019","RE: Kia Sorrento 2008 & our unanswered letter from Feb 3rd
We are still very displeased by the untruths told us by the Pre-owned Sales Manager and Service Manager of the Dallas Land Rover dealership.  No vehicle should require over $1,500 worth of work which was hidden from us to be discover less than 100 miles from what we had believed to be an honest  transaction.
We were told by the Used Car sales Manager how well he knew this car.  He told us that a school teacher who had wanted a certain Land Rover you had drove it from New Mexico.   He also told us that the Service Department had gone over it completely & there were only 2 minor problems.  He asked us to sign a paper that he had told us everything  wrong with this Kia.  As soon as our mechanic  at Firestone drove it he knew it was the differential was out.  He said any mechanic would have known  it by driving or putting it on the rack.  What makes it even worse is the bearings being packed to hide the sound as pointed out by Eagle Transmission   Refer to my letter of Feb. 3rd.
Our next step will be the Better Business Bureau.

13,"April 22, 2018","We purchased a Landrover discovery sport from Chad Jenkins yesterday and had an excellent experience. 

Going in we did not know what model we wanted and we were not familiar with differences throughout the lineup. 

Chad did an excellent job discovering needs and identifying the perfect Vehicle to meet our needs. 

The team worked with us to make the purchase meet our budget with the best financing rates available. 

Service like this is what creates racing fans of dealers as well as clients (not just one time customers) 

Thanks Chad and team for the help!",5.0

Jason Daniel in finance was prompt and easy to work with.  My positive experience is why I keep coming back.  You won't find the high pressure tactics of other dealerships here.  Brandon knew the products, took several sports for test drives.  He even called me the next day.  A+ across the board!",4.7
24,"April 27, 2015","Worst experience with a body shop I have every had. I have owned both a Lexus and a Mercedes and have had amazing customer service experiences with both the service department and the body shop. I was very disappointed with Land Rover Dallas. My car sat for weeks without being worked on when we were told the repair would only take a few days. We received minimal communication for the body shop personnel we were assigned to. I left several messages for him that he never returned. When we went to finally pick up our car, some of the repair was not completed and we had to go back again. Very disappointing and frustrating experience from a ""luxury"" dealer. 

If I can avoid every using them again, I will. ",1.4

Mike McGovern of Land Rover Dallas provided us with exceptional service and went above and beyond to make sure I was happy with my choice of vehicle.  He was very knowledgeable and most helpful in deciding upon accessories and upgrades, while keeping our budget in mind.  He was always  very solicitous and accommodating.  I would recommend Mike to anyone who wants to have a fabulous vehicle purchasing experience.   He was professional, thoughtful and very, very helpful.  All of the people at Land Rover Dallas were great.  I can't say enough about what a positive experience we had.  Call Land Rover Dallas and Mike McGovern today.",5.0
27,"April 14, 2015","I recently purchased a car from Land Rover Dallas. I was fortunate to work with a young, knowledgeable, cut to the chase, but very personable, young man named Dillon Hargrove.  
Dillon was able to answer all of our many questions without hesitation, going a step beyond with respect to making certain we saw and drove all cars we were wanting to choose from. Dillon was as cordial to us upon our first meeting as he was when it appeared as if we decided not to buy.
Initially we were looking at three different brands of cars but decided on a Land Rover not only due to the brand but equally important was the professional treatment we received from all people involed with this dealership. In addition, I did an extensive search as to the service provided by Land Rover Dallas and found it to be second to none. 
I, without reservation, recommend the brand and specifically this dealer to all those interested in a quality, exciting automobile.

53,"January 29, 2015","Nick was the reason we ended up making the purchase.  We left another car brand that we had been very loyal too largely because of the time and effort Nick spent making us feel comfortable.  He was patient, thoughtful and professional.  We never felt rushed or pushed in the deal.  He really helped us find a way to make it work.  Furthermore, we've never had someone take us through all the features of the car the way Nick did.  Typically you find yourself looking through the drivers manual days or weeks after you purchase a new car.  Nick is a human drivers manual and really cares about his customer.  

We had no expectations when we walked through the door, but Nick set the bar for customer experience to a whole new level.

I have purchased 2 Rovers from him in the past and always had an excellent purchase experience through him.

He thinks about them as critically as I do and I appreciate that.
 
Glad to call him a trusted friend over the last 9 years or so. Please feel free to call me personally if I may elaborate on him and/or Land Rover Dallas for you-it would be my pleasure to do so.

73,"September 06, 2014","I have been admiring the Evoque for quite some time but wanting to stay within a certain price range.  With inventory being limited and  'packages' limiting the amount of customization this vehicle allows, I kept finding either a) an Evoque I loved but cost too much or b) an Evoque in my price range but without some features I wanted.

Then one day when visiting this dealership for the 4th time, I stumbled upon an Evoque Pure Plus with Navigation and Sirius radio (my 2 must haves).  It was perfect and based on not being a ""Premium"" would fall into my price range.  The problem was it was in the dealership's loaner pool and wasn't scheduled to be released yet due to low miles.

My salesman Marcus and the dealership worked with me to get a few more miles on the vehicle so that it qualified for their certification program (warranty up to 100,000 miles).   They offered me a fair price on my trade based on comparisons with other dealerships.  

I've rated the experience good rather than excellent only because I did most of the mining for the car on my own over the months.  However, once I found the right car, Marcus went to work to make the deal happen for me.

Our sales rep was very thorough and patient explaining all the new details and features of the car. After we finalized all paperwork he asked if we would like him to come to our home and program the automatic gate and garage door remote for us. We explained yes, but that we had a new home and four cars so that I would hire someone that could do all four cars. He immediately offered to reprogram all four cars for us, came out the same day, and was successful with all four cars. The most dramatic ""above and beyond"" part of this customer service is what our rep did when we couldn't access the automatic gate control base unit  because the fence had been built around it. He stood in the mud with me and helped me take apart the fence so that he could access the gate control base unit, made the changes, then put the fence back together all with heat in the high nineties! When he finished all cars about an hour later, his sales clothes were soaked with sweat and his shoes were muddy. How could I ever not buy my next cars from this person?!?!      ",4.8

From the first moment I walked into the dealership til the moment i drove off in my new car, Baptiste was there for me for any question dumb or no.  He took time in the beginning to gauge what it is i was looking for and made his recommendations accordingly.  He didnt push extra options that he didnt think i would appreciate and for that, im thankful.  

The closing presentation was incredibly professional and somewhat futuristic.  They have your documents on a table top size ipad.  Jason was incredible on it.  He moved through the electronic documents like Tom Cruise in Minority Report.  

After the deal was complete Baptiste took the time to go through every detail of the vehicles capabilities and controls.  It was almost a 2 hour process, but Baptiste never once showed boredom or complacency in his presentation.  He had excitement for the vehicle from minute one until we ended with the parallel parking presentation.      

Despite the ridiculous cost of these vehicles the sales and closing process show why theyre considered the top tier in Luxury SUVs.

I loved that vehicle, but one of the main reasons I came back instead of trying out another car that I was looking at, was because of the incredible relationships I have developed with the dealership.  From Baptiste and Wayne Cloud to the women that answer the phones through everyone I came in contact with in the service department and the body shop, all are incredibly personable and professional.

I had been eyeing the new 2014 Sport body style for months and was pretty much ready to buy that day. Unfortunately, we found out there was a 4-6 month wait list. So we went ahead and put in our order, but Amanda let us know that we could very well take delivery sooner if one becomes available sooner if someone changes their mind etc. Amanda was very patient with my questions, I had quite a few, as we waited for our new Range Rover to come. Luckily, we only had to wait 3 weeks! One became available and Amanda let us know, it took only two days to take delivery when all was said and done. She was very attentive the entire time to every detail, and made sure I understood how to operate my new car when I took delivery.

He could not have taken better care of me!  Even though it wasn't a sale he dealt with the Landrover collision center for me and kept me update.  Furthermore, although there was no requirement for him to do so, he made sure my family had a loan car so we did not have to deal with the insurance company or a car rental company.

The collision center also kept me informed via regular emails and dealt with the insurance company when more damage was found.   

Finally I must comment on the quality of the work.   Joey at the collision center said it would be as good as new and it is.

Anyone buying a car from Mike can rest assured that his service will not stop there.

Thanks Mike!

He found creative ways to solve my issues -- trading in two cars, getting a tow hitch installed etc.  So that's why I gave the rating I did. One of the big reasons I decided to buy a Land Rover is service and location. I work a lot and I can't afford to spend a lot of time at the dealer waiting for service.  My impression having visited the dealership a few times was that the service was very high. Not only was the waiting area clean etc., but everyone was focused on making it a positive and quick experience.  I haven't taken my vehicle in for a servicing yet, but my mind is at ease. I believe that dealership is interested in having an ongoing relationship with me.

Mike is extremely knowledgeable about all LR vehicles and is extremely patient in explaining the features, even though I am sure he has done it hundreds of times.

Jason clearly explained all available options during the signing party in his office and much like Mike, did so with no pressure to buy or opt for any additional items.  He had me on my way in a very short time much to my appreciation.  As for parts/service, I have dealt with Joel Roberts on numerous occasions and if he doesn't have what I am looking for, he gets it. 

For those that are on the fence about a LR but concerned about reliability, don't be.  I had my last RRS for 4 years and never once had to take it in for anything other than scheduled maintenance.  The first question I usually get from people is ""how often is it in the shop, and my answer is ""never"".  Even scheduled maintenance is not a major inconvenience.

154,"August 29, 2013","I would not recommend this dealership even though I feel we initially got a good deal on our car. The salesman lied to us about what the car included. When my husband asked where the spare tire was, Wayne assured him that he did not need a spare since the car had runflats on it. After we took the car home, a mechanic friend of my husband's told him they were not runflats and when he looked them up, he found that no one makes runflats for the aftermarket wheel sizes that were on the car. When my husband went back to the dealership and told Wayne that they didn't have runflats as he told him it had, Wayne said he didn't care and the car was sold ""as-is"". So I would not recommend this dealership to anyone since they lie to sell a car and have no integrity to make right something they lie about. According to Wayne they sell this make and model of car a lot and he should have known better if that's true.

197,"July 24, 2013","Several months ago I stopped by your dealership to test drive pre-owned Range Rovers. I was fortunate to begin working with Amanda Del Llano who allowed me to test drive a number of your SUV's. She really took time to listen to me, understand my needs/concerns and answer my questions. I often wear a back brace (facing fusion surgery in the future) And due to previous back surgeries and knee issues it was extremely important that I find an automobile that was the right fit for me.  Initially I looked at 2010 & 2011 models and eventually test drove SUV's at Sewell Lexus as well. A couple of months into my search she phoned to let me know a white 2013 Range Rover (my desired color) was on site. After coming in I was fortunate enough to purchase an even nicer one (& more expensive = yikes!) with an interior I preferred with only 4,000+ miles). I love my new Range Rover!
Good customer service is not easy to come by these days. Before I ever came to your dealership I said a prayer asking The Lord for a salesperson who I felt comfortable with (who wouldn't be ""pushy"" or ""aggressive""). As a 53 year old woman with no real knowledge of cars and weak negotiating skills the ""salesperson"" mattered a great deal to me. Amanda Del Llano was a blessing and pleasure to work with!!! I felt so comfortable with her from the ""get go"". Her patience, kindness, listening skills, concern for my physical issues/comfort, knowledge and overall delightful personality ""sealed the deal"" and I purchased my 2013 Range Rover the same day I test drove it! I not only came away with a beautiful new Range Rover but the desire to adopt this lovely young lady (although perhaps her mother would prefer to keep her!). I'm smiling as I type this & hope you understand my humor! I believe developing such a comfortable, positive working relationship with Amanda was the deciding factor in choosing Land Rover Dallas and the SUV I purchased. She even made parting with so much money easier to do by her honesty and hard work on my behalf. Although she obviously desires to do well in sales I felt she truly had my best interest at heart!
Once the decision was made I then worked with Kristen Johnson regarding financing my Range Rover. Again, I think I might have to ""adopt her"" as she was so delightful to work with. Her joy, enthusiasm, financial knowledge and patience made the contract & payment ""far less painful"". Her bubbly personality and shining spirit are an assest to your organization.
Perhaps I am not your typical client (in light of issues mentioned above). But it is with much gratitude that I thank Amanda, Kristen and your team for your excellent service. I especially credit Amanda for helping me feel welcome (& not out of place) in an environment that is a bit out of my ""comfort zone"".
Best wishes to you and your staff at Land Rover Dallas. I look forward to working with you in the years to come.

I decided to buy when I noticed my Pilates partner loved her Land Rover and bought another one when she decided to replace her car. After watching her enjoy her new car for a year, I started asking more questions. She told me how much she loved her sales consultant. How easy he was to work with. What a nice person he was. And how he made buying a car a low key, low pressure experience. She also admitted to being a loyal Land Rover owner and having good experiences with the car.

One afternoon I sent Mike an e-mail note to arrange an educational appointment, and he responded within 30+ minutes. The next afternoon I met him and he proceeded to understand my needs and then show me each of the model options that met my criteria. He was very patient and made me feel like he reserved the whole afternoon for me (which is good; since I was there the whole afternoon). At the end, I asked him if I could buy a car. There was no pressure or mention of buying today from him--he respected my initial request to keep the meeting educational. 

Once we agreed on price and trade-in value for my Mercedes, I asked Mike if we could complete the transaction the next day. I had an early dinner engagement and needed to get home. When I came back the following afternoon, the paperwork was ready for signature and the transaction simply completed. Mike proceeded to sit in my new car with me, providing a tutorial on all the features and helping me with the custom set up. After I left, he also followed up with me to make sure I was happy.

About the time the big hail storm blew threw (no, my car was safe!) my battery died. My car just would not start when I went out the garage one morning. Roadside assistance could not start it. The dealership was in high gear dealing with the hail damage. Yet the service department and Mike drove to my house that afternoon with a slightly hail damaged sales car (all service loaners were out) and got my battery recharged and working. They still had me keep the loaner and drove my car back to the shop to make sure there was not a larger problem. All was done at no charge and I picked up my car within a couple days.

These are the reasons I enjoy working with Mike and the Land Rover Dallas service department.",5.0
220,"August 07, 2012","I had a great buying experience.  Michael and Jon were very knowledgable and helpful.  I was very pleasantly surprised how well they worked together throughout the process.  I have purchased cars at other dealerships where you got a sense that the competition for commissions was so great that the customer came in 3rd or 4th.  These guys put the customer 1st, and I truly appreciate it.

221,"August 07, 2012","I purchased a Range Rover Sport about three months ago from Matt. Before purchasing I spent several days test driving the cars and gathering information. One weekend Matt was not available and David stepped in to help me for over an hour. Knowing he wasn't getting the credit for this sale, he still gave me his undivided attention and never made me feel I was wasting his time. He was very knowledgeable about your product and if he didn't have the answer he was pro-active in finding the answers. I am a Realtor in the Metroplex and my navigation system is a very importanat tool in my business so I had very detailed questions about the navigation system.  David spent time researching the options and addressed each one of them in detail. About a week after my purchase Matt was no longer at the dealership. Once again, David stepped in to help me with programming my car to the garage and even came to my house on his day off! David provided his cell number in case I needed more information and responded PROMPTLY each time I called.  I can't tell you when I have experienced such exceptional customer service! I will highly recommend David Hamer to everyone wanting to purchase from Land Rover!

222,"December 28, 2011",I purchased a 2006 Jeep Liberty from Land Rover Dallas and I could not be happier. I had a challenging credit situation with the pending short sale of my house in Maryland. Bobbie worked diligently and got me an excellent interest rate on my loan and payments I can afford. At this reasonable price I still have warranty and GAP insurance protection. Working with Land Rover was the best of the 5 car buying experiences I have had in life. Wen I need a car I will use Land Rover Dallas again.,5.0
223,"April 26, 2011","Great dealership!!!! Everyone was very friendly and patient.I like how everyone that works at that dealership is friendly not just the individuals working directly with you. Other employees make you feel welcome and comfortable. 
Tom did a great job answering all the questions I had about the Land Rover I purchased. He is friendly and his patience is appreciated.  
Bobbie Strock was wonderful when it came to helping me decide what warranty I would like on my vehicle along with other options. She took the time to explain everything to me and I didn't feel obligated to buy something just to buy it, she really let it all be my decision and helped me pick out the best package to suit my needs and driving style. 
Tom and Bobbie have both done a great job staying in contact with me after I bought my Land Rover. I can honestly say they have gone the extra mile to make my experience extremely pleasant! THANK YOU Tom and Bobbie I would defiantly recommend buying a vehicle from Land Rover Dallas.

224,"April 26, 2011","We just can't say enough about Steve and Bobbie.  These guys a rare find.  We went in to purchase an LR3 but unfortunately we did not have enough down payment to finalized the deal. Steve then introduced us to this great LR2 and reduced the price to fit our budget.  Bobbie(finace mgr) came into the picture when the bank wanted and extra $700 to our down payment to close the deal.  And of course we did not have an extra $700.  After a week of going back and forth with the bank, Bobbie on behalf of Land Rover of Dallas decided to once again reduced the price by $700 so that we can have the car.  As such, we intend to be life time customers of this dealership. Land Rover Dallas is Super Great and we will make sure our friends and anybody who will listern hear about this wonderful experience.

225,"April 19, 2010","Words can not express the lengths I take to NOT go to this place.  Unfortunately, I purchased my car there (new) and i get a free loaner and it is under warranty still, so it still makes the most sense for ""warranty fixes"". I am appalled that this dealer is still allowed to sell a Luxury brand like Land Rover.  I was jerked around in the sales process and at EVERY point since then.  Their service department is horrendous!!  Look, most knew going in that we were not buying a Honda and that there would be maint issues here and there, and honestly, that is not what bugs me.  It is the manner in which they treat customers and the quality of their work.  You are catering to a client that does not have the time for shenanigans and bullsh$t or to wait a month for a loaner to be available.  These guys would all get fired at any other luxury brand in the area or any other dealer for that matter.  It is no wonder that there are so many businesses popping up to repair Land Rovers in the area.  There is a demand to NOT use these guys!!  It is really sad for Land Rover, because of my (and every LR owner in Dallas i know) experience here I will never buy another Land Rover in Dallas.  Why? Because these guys are still the dealer we have to put up with.  Let,s group together and start another Dallas Land Rover dealership!!  Hey Land Rover!! Shop your dealers! Use their Service department anonymously!!  See if we are lying!  Have some quality control.  I think I am going to start a Facebook Group ""I hate Snell Land Rover Dallas"".  Look for it, and Join it!  Maybe that will get Land Rovers attention?  Oh and Land Rover-i loved dealing with my old car dealers- Mercedes, BMW, Lexus, and even Ford dealers were all amazing.  They always were there and never once did I ever complain to any of them let alone look on the internet for a forum!!",1.4
226,"May 30, 2009","Watch out for internet sales! 


Apparently just because a vehicle is posted online, it doesn't mean it's available. 

After replying to an internet ad on AutoTrader.com, I visited the Land Rover Dallas store twice.  Both times I was informed that the vehicle in question was not available for a test drive. 


Before returning, I specified a time to take a test drive and modified my work schedule to do so, so the fact that the vehicle was still not available for a test left me taken aback. The total lack of consideration for my time and energy was also a bitter pill. 

Instead I was repeatedly asked (in person, via email, and via phone) to fill out a credit application despite the fact that I had already brought my own financing with me. 


After setting up another test drive appointment, this time with the Centre Manager, I received a call from the salesperson that same afternoon stating that despite my continued attempts to test drive the vehicle, he hadn't been sure I was interested in it and so had sold it. 

The experience was a tremendous waste of my time, excessively complicated, and stressful. I'm still kicking myself for even going back the second time, because the 'deal' I was trying to get certainly wasn't worth the experience I received.

227,"May 14, 2009","I was surprised that this dealer got so many negative comments from other people.  I have a 2007 Range Rover Supercharged which I bought at a dealer in another state  before I moved to Dallas.  I have had my Range Rover serviced at both the Frisco and Dallas dealers (same owner) with excellent results.  They have fixed my problems quickly and correctly without charge (under warranty) and the service advisors have been friendly and helpful.  Frankly, I am shocked to read that others have had so many problems.  I will certainly keep the experiences of others in mind as I deal with this dealer, but so far my experience has been totally different from others on this web site.",4.4
228,"May 08, 2009","I have been repeatedly gouged by this dealer's service department.  Most recently they sold me a valet key for $30 that turned out not to work in the ignition.  When I needed it to work, I was parked at the airport.  After several hours I got the towtruck to come.  The next day, Land Rover called and explained to me that they had sold me a Discovery Series 1 key that ""usually works"".  Then they went on to tell me the ignition cylinder was bad and I had two choices: Pay $850 to replace just the cylinder or $1200 to replace the lock and get new remotes.

I might have believed it had they not tried to screw me a month before.  In that instance they tried to charge $600+ to reconnect the power wire for my A/C which had been ""chewed up by some animal"".  I took it home and fixed it in 30 minutes with a soldering iron.  It looked like the wire had been cut by someone.

I wouldnt allow them to do anything more with the lock and am now towing it up to LR Frisco.  Its the same ownership, but hopefully their approach to managing the business is a little more ethical.",1.6
229,"January 06, 2009","All the other reviews are accurate.  Their customer service is horrible and their tactics are those of very low end car dealers.  They lied to us during our attempted purchase, tried to manipulate our financing (we have great credit and had been approved through our own bank) and even tried to sell our purchased vehicle to somebody else at a higher price after we'd done a deal and had the check on the way from our bank.  They were arrogant, aggressive and ended up insulting me when I called them out on their lies.  Calls to friends in the industry confirmed that you should run away from these guys.  Too bad they own the Frisco and Austin dealerships too, as that knocks out Land Rover from our list of possible buys.  The bad reputation from this company is well deserved.  I ended up NOT purchasing after all the hassle.  Thank goodness we never got stuck with a vehicle from them because if trying to buy one results in this much bad behavior I can only imagine how bad the service is after the sale on a notoriously flawed line of vehicles.  They are jerks with a high maintenance product.  All they seem to care about is sucking you into their messed up world so they can rape you with every scheme in the book.  And honestly, they were all pretty stupid when it came to their matter of expertise.    ",1.4
230,"September 25, 2008","We bought a 2008 Range Rover and have nothing but bad experiences with this delearship since.  I drive 2 hours for service to fix something, leave with something else wrong.  Take back for oil change, pick up and car has been damaged. DON'T GO THERE!!!",1.3

They are a disaster and i would stay away from them at all cost. I purchased my car new and have had problems with them since day 1. BEWARE of land rover dallas. Don Snell should be locked up for the way he runs this place.,1.0
232,"December 16, 2007","Customer service is very poor. Bought BMW X5 from them. Promised to be ready. Stop by to pick up the car. The car wasn't ready. Had to wait for inspection sticker. Finally left without a car. Again got a call to pick license plate, stopped by to pick up the plate and guess what??? The wasn't there. Their excuse was the lady who handles the plates was off. What a lame excuse. Waste time and gas... Very very very poor customer service experience and will not recommend anybody to deal with this dealer.",2.5
233,"October 10, 2006","These guys are horrible!!  Purchased a new Car from them which breaks down every week and can never get them to fix it.

They have no consideration for anyones time and I am often told ""i think we fixed it""....Seriously?  Either you did or you didn't.  Usually they didn't.  I will never buy from them again!! I will probably never buy a Land Rover again if these are the types of Clowns i have to deal with!!!!!!!!!!!",2.0
