4,"July 23, 2019","Took car in at 7 am for oil change and car wash. Got called at noon to tell my car is ready, so when I got there car was not wash. Person said it was the computers fault because they were down. But the the order was written on the paper. Just tell me the truth since I took time out of my lunch hour to go pick up the car. ",3.6

6,"June 12, 2019",This service department does nothing other than try to RIP off its customers by trying to sell services not recommended by my vehicle manufacturer.  Matter of fact is that the manual with your car tells you when to do services and when the service department recommends services that are over 100k miles early there is a problem.  Will not return and didnt find the customer experience manager helpful at all.  Good luck if you come here.,1.0
7,"June 02, 2019",We were quoted for parts but not the labor. We were shocked when we got the bill. Paid it and looked at the itemized bill and it still didn’t state what hourly labor rate was.  Called to talk to manager and hourly rate is double what our local mechanic shop charges. We were on vacation so I think they took advantage. ,2.2

9,"April 01, 2019","Everything went fine except at the end. Sitting waiting for car and my car had been sitting out front for 
about 30min. with car running and window down. I had to go ask BJ what was taking so long, she went to talk to technician and he said he left it up front, window down and running but didn't tell anyone it was there. Not happy at all after that.",3.2

12,"February 15, 2019","I took my truck in to get a mirror repaired that I messed up.  I called in to set an appointment.  I was graciously transferred to parts to make sure the parts were available.  Parts department person asked for my last eight VIN numbers, even suggested checking my insurance which was a great suggestion.  They looked up my vehicle, said they had one in stock, asked if it was chromed, I replied yes.  I prepaid for the only part in stock so it wouldn't gone before my service, transferred back to service to set up and appointment.  All is good to this point.  I show up for the appointment the next day.  All seems to be flowing when the service man comes to me and informs me that the chrome part is not transferable and that there is an additional price for the chrome part that snaps on.  Also, I'll need to set up another service appointment to get that taken care of as well.  I ask a few questions.  They just don't have the part although it was brought up the previous day.  The rest of the equipment was installed great, just no back cover for the mirror leaving all wires exposed to the elements.  I leave the location unhappy.  I pull over and do a quick search to find another AutoNation GM dealership with a parts and service available.  I call, they have the part.  I go over, purchase the part, go outside and snap it on myself.  I'm wondering why one AutoNation dealership couldn't have contacted the other to ask if they had the part and made it a complete job versus wanting me to set up another appointment to have a part snapped on in 2 minutes.  Could it be capitalism?  Disappointed.  Again, the passenger side mirror appears to have been installed correctly, but leaving the job half done after supposedly ordering the whole thing only to be told it wasn't and that I needed to come back again.

13,"January 28, 2019",BJ was the service person that took care of me on this visit and as usual the dealership did a fantastic job for me. They always are friendly and the work that I’ve had done to this point has been top notch. I recommend this dealership to any Chevrolet vehicle owner.,5.0

21,"September 07, 2018","We have 2 Chevy dealers in Corpus AutoNation South, and North. I have always done my dealing with Allen Samuels Chevy for service on my two vehicles.  Chuck has been my service writer for as long as I have done business with them.   Chuck is an awesome service writer. He is a pro at answering my questions, and concerns.  I would give  him 100 stars if the review would let me.  I  have never had any issues with AutoNation South, I have had numerous problems with their body shop, and the service dept. . The service writers, and managers  needs to work on their  customer service skills.  The person that answered  the phone was completely rude with me,  I called back, asking for a manger to call me, I never heard back from them. That's pretty sad when You Leave a message, and never receive a call back from AutoNation South. That tells me that you do not care about your customers. Needless to say I will be staying with AutoNation North.

22,"May 03, 2018","We called the service department after hearing a sound that sounded like a jack hammer coming from underneath the car.  It was jerking and carrying on and then all of a sudden stopped and behaved properly.  Not wanting to take a chance on driving it, we were given an 8 am Friday appointment, but took the car in the night before.  No loaner was available for 2 weeks.  Late Friday afternoon, we received a call that the sound could not be duplicated, but they did find over $2500 worth of 'other' repairs.  Not feeling comfortable, we called a good friend who has a fleet of vehicles to see who he used.  After paying the $185 'diagnostic' fee, we took the car to another place and found the problem was the emergency brake cable had snapped and not working at all and this would cause a jack hammering sound and the jerking motion.

24,"March 09, 2018","I had a problem with first servicing about 3 months after I purchased the vehicle from the same dealership 2yrs ago.  As a result, I went to a Dodge/Ram dealership 25 miles away since GM is a friend of family. He's taken great care of me.  However, the issue I needed worked on in Mar. 2018 was for a part/repair under warranty so I wanted Chevy (AutoNation) to fix it.  From start to finish, it took about 11 days to resolve.  Originally, took an hour to tell me a part needed to be ordered when the vehicle was looked at.  Then, the original part ordered was for 3rd row seatbelt when it was for 2nd row seatbelt.  Then, after parts arrived, service employees were out (Fri, Sat, Mon), and repair wasn't done until Tues.  The loaner I was promised early on apparently didn't exist anymore.  Instead of me telling them I needed to come back 2 weeks later to have fix done (because of long trips I was going on over next 2 weeks), they mysteriously found a loaner vehicle for someone else and let me use it.  As a Realtor, hard to work & make money with no loaner vehicle, especially when I was told I'd have one.  Had to get my client involved, as they are the Sales Mgr at this dealership, but even with his help, service experience was less than pleasant.  Very disappointed, assuming I gave a 2nd opportunity to this dealership in my only 2 servicing attempts with them.  Will be my last unfortunately.  Back to Dodge/Ram dealership 25 miles away in a different city for all my servicing needs.  The drive (albeit inconvenient) results in a much more professional & pleasant experience.",3.2
25,"February 19, 2018","Edward and the Staff at Auto Nation were a life saver. My father had passed and the day before his funeral my 2013 Suburban LTZ needed the BCM (Body Control Module) replaced and reprogrammed. The tow truck picked up my vehicle around noon. Edward called me and informed me the my vehicle arrived at there location,  he then called again when they began the work. I received a call around 5 letting me know that my vehicle was ready for pickup. I was amazed at the turn around time and was very please with the prompted Service and attention by Edward and Staff to my needs under very trying times.

26,"December 20, 2017","Not the best experience. I'll try to keep this short. We spent too much time waiting for Josh after our test drive and I believe my wants were not being considered. The keys to my vehicle were lost. My husband went into the office to help search for them. 5 minutes later, there were 5 people in the office searching for my keys and they mysteriously show up on the rack my husband just looked on  and then I was asked why I was upset. My keys have a medal of Our Lady on them. It was hard to miss. Some woman who did not introduce herself came in to discuss an offer and just started running through it, not looking at us, and then saying we couldn't play with numbers. I told her my trade in was worth more than what I was being offered and then NO, we were leaving. I admit I was upset and I was rude to her but being handled like that  was the last straw for me and I just  wanted to get away. Very unorganized. Very unprofessional. Playing games instead of taking care of a potential new car buyer. We went there first because they had the color of vehicle I wanted. We will not be visiting again and will definitely advise others against stopping by.",2.0

30,"July 11, 2017","This was nothing like I expected. I wasn't too optimistic about going over there due to an unpleasant encounter I had with Alice Chevrolet last year. However, this was a totally different experience. Everyone that I had contact with at Autonation Chevrolet North CC were fast, friendly, and knowledgeable. I got the the best deal I could get and they made sure it fit my budget. No time messing around. I was blown away by the friendliness of the staff from Kelly to Dan to Paul to Tracy and so on. From the moment I walked in, I was greeted and treated like a friend. Excellent customer service. I had an amazing experience and will definitely recommend them to everyone. 5-star review and 2 thumbs up. ",5.0

34,"March 31, 2017","The initial interaction with the service advisor, when I dropped off my vehicle, was less than average.  The issue started when I was told that my vehicle may take the entire day even though I had made an advanced appointment.  Then the advisor made me look for my guarantee papers and that I would need to make some calls to find out what could be covered.   I know that previous deleterious take care of this for me in the past.  Just seemed that the advisor didn't wanted to work.

But overall, the service department was great! I was given the updates calls and eventually my vehicle was returned on a reasonable time. ",4.4
35,"October 07, 2004","I recently bought a car at allen samuels for my son. It's his first car. I put the down payment and he will be making the payments. He is a senior in high school and is 17 years old. After having done all our dealings, my salesman mentioned that we as customers were very important and if we needed anything, let him know. I bought an AVEO on a saturday and on friday it was in the shop. I went and talked to my salesman(that would help us) and he said they'll take care of it. The car was totally put off because of previous work and appointments. By the end of the day they said they couldn't find the problem. All weekend long the car kept turning off in the middle of traffic with my son. I took the car back on the following tuesday again the car was put off and by the end of the day they said they would have to keep it overnight to try to duplicate the problem. Both times that I went in I made sure to go first thing in the morning. I was there a few minutes after 8 am each time. next day  I called in the afternoon and was told the problem again could not be duplicated. By that saturday the engine light came on so i returned the car to the dealership. It was about 2:30pm. I was told the car could not be looked at  till monday. Today is Thursday, and I haven't gotten my car back.  Supposedly the problem is a egr valve. They can't seem to find a valve. Still waiting. By the way I mentioned my problems to my salesman and haven't heard from him yet. I would not recommend this dealership. The new car customer is not first. The sale is made and see you later.",1.0
