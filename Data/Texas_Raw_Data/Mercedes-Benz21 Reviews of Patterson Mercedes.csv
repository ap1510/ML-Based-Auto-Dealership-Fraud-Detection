0,"June 05, 2020","I‚Äôve been dreading buying a car for years. The idea of been bullied all day long, shuffled around to different departments like a ping pong ball to eventually end up furiously signing page after page of documents full of legal jargon without bothering to read the fine print or caring, because I just want to get the xxxx out of there! I dreaded it so much that by the time my trusty Tahoe limped into the dealership, it simply collapsed like a marathon runner after crossing the finish line and whispered, ‚Äúit‚Äôs time, Lisa. I can see the light... Let me go for god‚Äôs sake!‚Äù üòµüòÇ
I was nervous, hesitant and not looking forward to the day, but I had done my homework and was ready for battle. I knew what vehicle I wanted, was already approved for financing, wrangled up a down payment to show them I was serious and alerted the sales manager I was coming. I had even brought my father with me. A no-nonsense retired Naval Officer. As soon as I entered the Mercedes showroom, an Angel named Elizabeth Speers, welcomed us into her office. She took my hand and gently guided me throughout the process. I kept waiting for something to dampen my day; an evil Mercedes associate to pop out and ruin this pleasant experience, but IT NEVER HAPPENED! 

I stated my case to Elizabeth. She handed me and my father the keys to the Mercedes and told us to go test drive it, while she tried to meet my requests. When we returned a short time later she was ready to do business. Thirty minutes later I was on my way to lunch while the paperwork was being prepared. I next found myself in the finance department. I thought, ‚Äúthis is it. This is going to suck.‚Äù I was wrong.
We signed paperwork with movie star gorgeous and very dapper, Jabin Smythe. I signed paperwork and we shared Seinfeld anecdotes and cracked up. It was quick and painless and the icing on the cake was a lower interest rate compared to what I managed with my bank.
I finished my day with my new friend, Elizabeth Speers, whom took the time to show me what all of the buttons and dials did in my beautiful new Mercedes-Benz. That‚Äôs when I meet Todd, the Mercedes guru, whom made me feel confident that he‚Äôd have my back when issues arise in the future. 
Look, I did my homework prior to setting foot in the dealership. I could‚Äôve gone to OKC, Tulsa, Dallas, but the biggest lure for me is the service they provide after the sale. Whenever I need maintenance, an associate will drive to my home, pick up my car, provide me with a loaner and deliver my serviced vehicle back to my home. I don‚Äôt even live in the same state! ü§Øü§Øü§Ø 
Patterson has almost every brand of vehicle you could ever want. It‚Äôs like a Disney World for car buyers. Do your homework, put some comfortable shoes on and head to Patterson for your next vehicle purchase. And if you see Elizabeth, tell her the Naval Captain and Lisa sent ya! üòä",5.0

2,"May 14, 2019",I recently purchased a Mercedes Benz from Bobby Nunn. He was very kind and was with me through the entire process. No pressure at all. He is honest and did everything he stated prior to the sale. He is the ultimate professional. I would purchase a vehicle from him whenever I need one. I highly recommend this dealership and Bobby Nunn. Ask for him. He will provide you a very positive buying experience. ,5.0
3,"December 29, 2018",Sherman Ray and the entire Patterson team were outstanding helping me through the purchase. I highly recommend them. Very professional and courteous. We drove all the way from Mississippi to pick up my dream car and they couldn't have been more helpful or friendly. Thanks!,5.0
4,"October 29, 2018","Picked up a C-Class from here...

It was painless, simple, straightforward and no B.S.

Was already planning on and getting ready to have a Lexus shipped here from Arizona... (just had to sign the papers)

My ‚Äòlady found this Merc here locally by a chance look to see what was here.

Kinda glad she looked now.

Tyler Fritze is the gentleman whom we dealt with.

A+++ experience!!! Everything about it all...

Have no hesitation saying, if you land on this review and this MB dealership, ask for Tyler.",5.0
5,"May 09, 2017","Elizabeth Speer is still a Star at Mercedes and Patterson auto center.  It was so pleasant to see most of the same people that were there in 2007 when my last Mercedes purschase was. Both Todds I have known for over 20+ years. Everyone was professional  and very friendly with nice smiles. The process was exceptional from start to drive out. Mr Patterson you should be proud of your staff. Thank you all,
Will see you in 3 years or sooner. Glad to buy from local dealer again. ",4.8

10,"March 13, 2017","First time buying a car and everything went absolutely perfect. I live in Dallas and drove to Wichita Falls due to the great service that Patterson Mercedes provides.  Elizabeth made the car buying experience easy and enjoyable.  I was able to work out the details over the phone and when I showed up to finalize the paperwork, the car was on the showroom floor detailed and ready to go. Whole process took about 30 minutes and everything we discussed was already correctly in the contract.  Couldn't imagine buying a car from another dealer, and would be glad to make the 2 hour drive to work with Elizabeth again. Highly recommend Patterson Mercedes.",5.0
11,"January 29, 2017","Since 1991, I have always been happy with the care and service I have received.  Working with Elizabeth, Todd and Jerry is always fun, educational and exciting.  Elizabeth knows my taste and works hard to find a match for my vehicle needs. Batting 100 so far. Todd is always nice and gracious when showing me new technologies and conveniences in vehicles.  He also makes sure I have comfortable loaners when my car is serviced with no complaint or long wait.  Jerry is the bees knees when it comes to making sure I am always provided timely and excellent service.  He personally sees to my needs and makes sure I am happy with servicing results. Excellent service from Roger and all the technicians.  I have been very happy to continue to work with this team in my car buying experiences.  And it is always nice to see Chris Emory's smile!",4.8
12,"November 24, 2016","Just purchased a 2017 GLE Coup at Patterson Mercedes in Wichita Falls even though I live in Dallas.  The entire transaction of getting a competitive trade in on my current vehicle and coming to an agreement on the purchase price of the new car was all done over the phone with Chris Emery. The entire experience was calm, stress free.  The entire trade in and purchase decision was done in less than 45 minutes.
The next day I drove out (an easy ride) to pick up the new GLE and it was in the showroom 100% detailed and ready to drive away.  Paperwork was done in the Finance office on a large PC tablet which made it easy to review all the options.  Paperwork took about 30 minutes to complete.  Tyler, the delivery tech took us through all the functions of the car and answered all our questions.  If you want to be treated like a customer vs. just another transaction, go check out Patterson Mercedes.  5 Stars!

14,"October 08, 2016","I have dealt with this dealership for years. I just brought home my sixth Mercedes, a 2017 E320. Elizabeth Speers is a pleasure to deal with along with Todd Bell, who has infinite patience with me in teaching me all the new info on this car, and Chris Lunsford, the financial officer.  I live in the DFW area and they take very good care of me, picking up my car and bringing me a MB loaner!! This dealership is the BEST!!",5.0

16,"July 06, 2016","When we went into the dealership, we were just dressed in casual shorts and t-shirts, and we weren't judged by our looks, but by our interest of the vehicles. Good dealerships look at selling cars, but Great dealerships such as Patterson looks at customer satisfaction.

17,"June 30, 2016","We drove from Oklahoma City to Patterson Auto Group in Wichita Falls TX to view a 2014 BMW advertised on the internet.  The salesperson, Tyler Caskey, had the car ready for us to test drive and was extremely knowledgable about the vehicle.  When we finished driving, we walked around the lot and looked at the new Mercedes models, just for fun.  We saw the new model GLC and asked to test drive one in the color we were looking for.  Long story short, we bought the car!  Tyler was very knowledgeable about this car, but did not pressure us at all, just explained all of the features.
I would highly recommend this dealership and the salesman, Tyler Caskey, as he truly made the experience a very pleasant one!",5.0
18,"June 29, 2016","This was the best experience in car sales that I have had yet, the whole process was easy and trouble free. Tyler Caskey was such an easy going but informative salesman, very professional. The whole Mercedes /BMW section was so clean and everyone was so nice. The finance specialist got me a great rate with the bank and even that process was wonderfully painless. I loved the entire buying process.",5.0
19,"June 25, 2016",I have purchased many cars in my lifetime and this one may be my last but it was by far the most pleasant experience.  Everyone was so pleasant and helpful and really helped put me at ease and made this such an enjoyable experience.  I love my new car and look forward to dealing with everyone at Patterson Mercedes over the next few years.,5.0
