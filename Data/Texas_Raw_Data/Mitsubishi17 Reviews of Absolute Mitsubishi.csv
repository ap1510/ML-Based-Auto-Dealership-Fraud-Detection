He answered all our questions and addressed every concern we had with great patience.  Mr. Trotter is a model example of a great sales consultant!  Thank you!!!,5.0
1,"July 02, 2012",My experience at Absolute Mitsubishi was just what I was looking for in a car buying trip. From the moment I was on the lot I never felt pressured or guided to a decision. Trey was a knowledgeable consultant who really wanted me to make the right decision based on my own preferences. I look forward to recommending my friends to take a look at this dealership the next time they're in the market.,4.6

3,"June 27, 2012","This was my first visit to a car dealership on my own. I was impressed by the courtesy and attention I was shown. I met the general manager and many of the other sales people. Mr. Trotter laid everything out for me, explained my credit scores and how I could improve my credit. He was professional but very kind. I never felt he was talking down to me or that he was trying to take advantage of me. I felt he truly wanted me to get the best deal on a car that I could get. He showed me how I could come back at the end of the summer with my repaired credit and buy a car. He even let me test drive the car I chose even though I couldn't buy it that day. When I am ready to buy a car I will come back to Mr. Trotter where I know he has my back.

6,"March 26, 2012","I had been to at least 3 other dealerships before I came to Absolute  none of them showed the level of professionalism that Absolute Mitsubishi has shown me right from the very start. My salesman Gordy Collier was honest and forthcoming about the whole car buying experience and of the challenges that I have on my credit. I walked into the car dealership with very little hope but Absolute made me feel that nothing was too hard for them to handle and to my surprise the process was rather quick and easy. I drove off the lot with my brand new 2012 Mitsubishi Galant with payments that was within my budget. If you're looking for a new car or truck I highly recommend giving Absolute Mitsubishi a try.  I really would like to thank my Salesman Gordy Collier, Michael Redd with internet sales and Errol Wilson Manager of Sales for making my car buying experience the best ever!",5.0
7,"March 18, 2012","I had a good experience with this dealership.  I was happy they could get me into a car even thoughit didn't look that good on paper for me.  They nevedr treated me as if I was not worthy to be in a brand new vehicle.  Great people with great attitudes.

8,"June 24, 2011"," My husband and I both ended up buying vehicles and were both treated with respect and the owner Ardi Fazeli even came out and introduced himself and we really enjoyed the whole experience. The service department is 5 star quality and wouldn't think of taken our vehicles any other place. They get you in and out as quickly as possible and always get the job done right and will actually walk you around your vehicle and explain the repairs needed unlike other repair shops we've been to. Fazeli Mitsubishi your guys are the best. Keep up the great work guys.

9,"May 12, 2011","   After doing alot of research online and visiting multiple dealerships not finding what i wad looking for i stopped in at Fazeli.  I had heard good stories but was skeptical.  I worked with Etheridge and David Hill amd found the car i saw online and they made sure I felt comfortable with the terms.  I was very impressed by how smooth the process was. 
   We all know how big of a nightmare going into the finance office can be but the was the furthest thing from the case.  I worked with Matt who showed me how i could put my loan together to be fully protected!  Normally waiting for finance can take hours an i have bought a few cars in my day, but Matt is the fastest I have ever seen.  He had me in and out in 25 minutes!  
   I will recommend all my friends and family to Fazeli!",5.0
10,"May 25, 2010",Fazelli Mitsubishi is a great choice for buying a new car.  It is a very comfortable place to be and they are easy to work with.  I got a great price on a great truck….they beat out the other dealerships I checked with.  Even got a good amount more than I expected on the trade in on my old truck.  I bought a new Mitsubishi Raider there last week and could not have been more pleased with the truck or the experience there at Fazelli.,5.0
11,"May 24, 2010","I want to tell everyone what a great experience we had at Fazelli Mitsubishi. I bought a new Galant for my daughter last weekend.  She graduated and needed a reliable and safe car to drive off to college.  We shopped around at several dealerships, and then stopped by Fazelli.  Now, the dealership is a little hard to get to…kinda tricky to get in there…. But that is the only bad thing I can say.  We got a great deal there and were very happy with the way they treated us.  They were very professional and honest with us about prices and fees.  We got through the purchasing and finance process without a glitch.  It was easy.  They helped us along every step of the way when we had questions about the car or the financing or what not.  I thought they did a great job.  My daughter is so excited about her new car.  We are all very happy and glad we went to Fazelli Mitsubishi.

12,"May 24, 2010","This is the absolute worse Auto dealership you can go to. They say they advertise that they offer 100% approval but in reality they are just blowing smoke up your ass. In my opinion this dealership has a bunch of ghetto workers as salespeople and the finance department seems to be very unorganized and crappy as well and try to stand on promises they cannot follow through on. When I went into the dealer ship I spoke with a girl that had gold teeth and the finance guy came out and was speaking to me with really bad breath. Long story short they strung me along for three days while at the same time I applied at Town East Ford for the same car and have been approved through Town East Ford and they did the deal the same day.  My advice is to go to one of the competitors that surround them like Drivers select or Nissan who really have the connections to deal with various credits. If you enjoy shooting the breeze in the hood with ghetto trash then this just may be the spot for you. I don’t wish bad luck on any person and these are my opinions according to my experience and I wish you all good luck and, happy driving… but try Town East or another area dealer first.",1.0
13,"May 07, 2010","Best service in town. Respectable dealer with a staff that enjoys what they do and customer service to put Zappos out of business. I have received numerous calls following up with me and making sure I’m taking care of to the maximum. Joel really impressed me with his work ethic and eagerness to assist me in every way. I purchased 2010 Endeavor simply by working with Joel over the phone due to being out of town 5-6 days out of my week. I came in this weekend and took delivery the quality of service was a 10 Star service. I commend Mitsubishi Fazeli for the quality of customer service they provide before, during, and after the sale.  ",5.0
14,"April 28, 2010","My wife and I went to Fazeli Mitsubishi last week and bought a very clean brand new looking Cadillac STS, we've bought serveral Cadillacs before and know they are high in price but somehow Fazeli Mitsubishi got us a much better deal than the cadillac dealer we usually go to. 

We were just ecstatic about buying a new car and the fact that we got it $2000 cheaper than other dealers saved us a nice amount of money, so now we're able to use that money towards having fun. We have been treated here better than any other dealership out there even at our Cadiallac dealer we used to go to and have bought before. We now know where we will be coming in the future. Doug was unbelieavable with his follow up and staying in contact with us and made sure we were comfortable the entire time. They have earned our business in the future. Excellent customer service, we're more than satisfied with our 2008 STS my wife shows it off at church all the time.",5.0
15,"April 28, 2010","I'm not sure why some dealers tell you one thing over the phone and then you walk in and it seems like the conversation over the phone was foreign language. I called asking about sevearal vehicles casue i'm not sure what I want but my uncle told me to come here so I did. I spoke with a lady over the phone and just about everything she mentioned was right on point, everytime she called me back she got information from the manager and the fact that she called me back was impressive. Well I went in and was helped by a few gentlemen specifically Glen, we sat we talked and he made sure he listened to what it was I was looking for. At the end of the day I got more than what I wanted, I got more than a fair price but most importantly I got NO BS and a brand new car. Glen was very helpful and listened to what I wanted not what he wanted me to buy. I appreciate these guys.",5.0
16,"April 28, 2010","I just bought a new 2009 Mitsubisi Outlander only 17,022 miles on it just immaculate condition I mean I feel like I just got this fresh off it being built. Most importantly I want to recognize the unbeatable service that was provided.

From start to finish, Billy helped me out... we laughed the entire time we were there this guy's a trip! He made sure my truck was extra clean he ran back and forth with Ray (think that's his name) getting my financing in place at the payment I could afford. I went back today, and I wasnt even out of my truck when Billy was already coming outside to greet me and to make sure I was taken care of and happy with my truck. I've had so many experiences where the minute I drive off the lot its like my salesman forgets who I am. He even sat outside with me to help me witht the features on my truck. Unbeatable service, with this Fazeli Mitsubishi.",5.0
