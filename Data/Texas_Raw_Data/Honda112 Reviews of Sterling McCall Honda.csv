0,"March 26, 2020","I am a disabled Veteran on a fixed income and I was in need of a more comfortable ride. The team at Sterling McCall Honda in Kingwood was very helpful in my purchase of a Honda Odyssey. Besides the fact that the car rides like a dream, I no longer needed to crawl into the hatchback of my old Mazda CX5 and lay down for trips to the VA Hospital while someone else drove me. My Salesperson, Julie Barnachea, and Finance Specialist Joseph Boguhet were extremely helpful and caring. I was in a lot of pain the day I bought the car and they helped my wife through the entire process while they helped me to be as comfortable as possible. I highly recommend Sterling McCall Honda in Kingwood and especially my Salesperson Julie Barnachea. ",5.0

The sales price agreed with the salesman was not reflected on the invoice, which conveniently was not show during signing process. It was put together with other papers in sealed envelope, which I opened only a day after. Be careful and review every line.",2.5

Very low pressure and informative service. Highly recommend! my salesperson was really good to work with and the finance guy was awesome with getting me an excellent deal. my credit was lower than I expected, but the rate he got was also lower than expected...   again, highly recommend!

9,"February 22, 2018", Brought my car to Sterling McCall Honda after the Glass sunroof spontaneously exploded. Nothing has hit it and there weren’t any issues with it. In looking this problem online others have had this problem too and it is attributed to either a manufacturing error in the safety glasses or a problem when it was installed too tightly. This dealership knows of this issue and kind of shrugged their shoulders and won’t take care of it. They want you to submit it to your own insurance even though it’s through no fault of yours or anyone else’s except theirs.  I was about to go buy a Honda Pilot for myself. I will not buy from a dealership that won’t stand behind a defect in its own vehicles.,1.0

21,"August 18, 2017","My service consultant was Sam Carcamo. He immediately checked me in, explained everything that is going to be done with my car. Showed me where the lounge was and offered refreshment while waiting for my car. A multi-point inspection was done, oil change and tire rotation was done. Since i'ts my car's first tine for oil change, the tire rotation was free. I'm very pleased with the excellent service i had today.",5.0
22,"August 14, 2017","I previously purchased a 2007 Civic from this dealership a long time ago so i went back to see what new models they had for 2017. I loved the redesigned 2016 civic so i decided in the end to just go with a silver LX model. The car salesman George Torres was patient, informative and very kind. He always tried to make sure everything was okay and answer any questions or concerns i had.

HOWEVER, the financial employee JOSEPH A BOGUHET who got all our paperwork done is extremely unprofessional and an outright liar. He might as well be a crook with the way he handles himself. When signing the papers he did nothing to explain what each paper really meant. I understand that it was a late Saturday night but he was more worried about making a buck and getting us out of there as fast as possible. My Honda and all certified cars come with a 7 year/100K warranty which is what i believed i was signing but he automatically signed me up for a completely SEPARATE 7 year/100K warranty that i never once asked for. The worst part of it is that he charged us 2800$! for it. So i did some more research and i can get a better Honda 120k mile warranty with a 0$ deductible for about 1K. That's almost a third of the price he sneaked into my contract!!!! The only reason he finally confessed that i could cancel was after i asked like 2 times. 

And to finally turn this into a absolute nightmare he also snuck in a ""Resist All"" customer care box into my contract that he informed us ""came with the car"". Not once did he mention in was going to cost me an absolutely ludicrous 1000$. When i confronted him about it he kept insisting that i received it with some sort of ""coupon"". I told him that couldn't be possibly be true and that you can't call something a coupon if there was no discount from a set price and that you CHARGED ME 1000$ FOR IT! That honestly seems like fraud. I asked nicely if they could just take it since i never even bothered opening it. They told me no and it was the one thing they couldn't help me with. Even though i went back with the box the following day before i even was allowed to drive my car out of there. 

So lets this get straight. Honda can cancel a 2800$ warranty after my first bill/before 60 days but they can't take back some insanely overpriced kit that i once never opened or asked for? I've lost all interest and respect in this company/dealership and the way they treat their customers. My friend and father were there to witness the whole thing and my friend told me that Joseph must have no sense of morality for doing something so slimy to someone who has happily buying a car from them. I will be doing every last thing possible to leave complaints/negative reviews for this dealership. If they refuse to help me out with something so simple as taking back an overpriced box then all their future customers deserve to know the lengths they will go to cheat a customer out of their money.

EDIT: I was told they couldn't take it back because the Resist All was applied to my car. That shouldn't fall on me since i was trying to stop them from even doing that to begin with. First it's because it's because of ""the contract"", then it was just ""we can't take it back"" and now due to"" it being applied""?

What really happened was that I came back on Monday to try to return it and i was kindly informed by my salesman that they weren't even close to attending my car. It wasn't even certified yet and i didn't get to drive it home UNTIL Wednesday around 12:45. I arrived there at about 11:00 and they were barely getting around to detailing it. So don't go around telling me it was applied on a Monday way before it was certified and cleaned/detailed.

31,"June 30, 2017","I have purchased many automobiles in my life but my most recent experience at Sterling McCall Honda was the best ever. As I arrived, I was greeted by a young man by the name Wilder who was not only courteous but extraordinarily knowledgeable. So often, one feels as though they are dealing with a carnival barker con artist but not this guy. The gentleman helping me with financing was terrific also. The final step of dealing with paperwork was also terrific. Shout out to Natali for her expertise and kindness. This is my third Honda and the process was painless! Thanks",4.8
32,"June 29, 2017","Unbelievable we have bought 3 cars from here all work done here and even bought all tires from here.  You don't find much more loyalty than our family.   However we had a flat on one of our tires and I took the tire in because we bought all the extra warranty stuff on the tires from here,  and I was told they would not stand good for the warranty but I could buy another tire from them.  There is no way I was going to buy anything from them after paying for a warranty they will not stand good for.  I ended up going to Costco and they fixed the tire for free.  How a dealership is willing to lose a loyal customer for so many years over fixing a tire that another place fixed for free is just not good business since in my opinion.   No way will I or my family do business with these crooks ever again.   Do your self a favor and go to another Honda dealership it's worth the little extra drive.",1.0
33,"June 28, 2017","I recently purchased a 2017 Honda Accord EX. This was my 5th vehicle purchased from a dealership. By far this was my best experience because of Robert Dams, my salesperson. He wasn't pushy or aggressive which made this purchase very enjoyable. I had visited 2 other dealerships in Houston over the last 10 months but didn't feel valued as a consumer. This dealership and my salesperson did everything they could to earn my business.  Thanks Robert !!!",4.8

41,"March 28, 2017","We were looking for a dependable car for our college-bound son. We found a certified 2016 Civic at Sterling McCall Honda that we unfortunately lost out on due to unexpected negative customer service with a certain salesman. Another salesman, Brayan Vasquez, went above and beyond to work with us to find an alternative to the certified car and got us a deal that convinced us to purchase a new one instead. He was extremely attentive and patient and considerate of our situation. Ultimately, despite our first experience at this dealership, we still ended up buying a car there, when we could have gone anywhere else merely on principle. My five star rating is mainly due to the great deal and excellent treatment given to us by Brayan specifically. Our experience with the finance manager Clayton Lewis was great too because he made us feel very comfortable, did not pressure us on the optional coverages, and we were able to get an even better interest rate financing directly with Honda. Overall, we were very pleased in the end.",5.0

Clattering noise at startup which disappears in 3-4 minutes after startup indicating a faulty timing belt tensioner . Belt water pump and seals replaced but NOT the tensioner . This being a kind of major overhaul why not replace the tensioner ??? Now 20 thousand mile later all needs to be replaced again?? This is the worded dealer ship service ever encountered 
The Service representative is trying to charge me for a new full belt replacement job? I beg your pardon 20 thousand mile and it is actually not done right in the first place?

54,"September 02, 2016","Laurie and Brandon are excellent! I'm sure the others are too,  but these are the only two I've dealt with over the last few months.

I was there last month for an airbag recall, a few months before that for a dead battery, and this week because my Ridgeline wouldn't start. Each time I've been there I have felt that Brandon and Laurie went above and beyond to make sure I was taken care of as if I were a family member! It is so refreshing to see that were are still brands that value excellent customer service and people that really care. 

My previous car was a Mercedes and their customer service is excellent too,  however,  I usually paid $1200 each time I needed routine maintenance. My Honda is a 2007 that has been long off factory warranty and I was treated even better than at Mercedes and I  didn't have to pay a dime. 

The first visit was the airbag recall,  so obviously that doesn't cost a customer anything. However my airbag parts wouldn't be in for two months and they paid for a rental car for me for the entire time! This time my truck wouldn't start so I called the service center and Laurie answered.  Laurie listened to my unique issue (stuck on the 6th floor of a Houston Med Center garage), she she told me to get my truck to the dealership and she would take care of me.

When I arrived at the dealership Laurie went out of her way to make sure I had a loaner vehicle while my truck was getting fixed. She showed empathy and caring and I genuinely felt that she cared for me as a person.  She got me into a new Civic as my loaner vehicle and communicated with me throughout the entire process that took a week to fix. They found the issue to be with my after market alarm.  They fixed that issue as well as replace the passenger side airbag,  put a new battery in one of my key fobs,  and washed and vacuumed the truck! They did all of this work for me on the house!!  I was definitely shocked and now,  little do they know,  I will upgrade my truck very soon for the new Ridgeline. 

I can't thank Laurie, Brandon and Sterling McCall Honda in Kingwood more for their superb customer service,  but I will try with a pizza party for the service center on me next Friday.  Thank you!

I did a lot of research online first, so I knew what I wanted. Brayan never tried to talk me into more than what I wanted to make the ""bigger sale."" I had a budget, and he respected that. And Ken, the finance manager, was just as kind and helpful. I never felt pressured, and I was offered a better price than anticipated based on my research. I love my new Accord, and the whole experience was amazing! I'll definitely recommend Sterling McCall to my family and friends!",5.0
56,"August 21, 2016","I'm a single mom and was really looking forward to buying an suv from sterling McCall Honda in king wood . I had previously owned a 2009 Nissan Rogue loved and just wanted something newer . So of course I went with a 2013 Nissan Rogue used and the only reason I did that was because I'm a first time buyer from a dealership so I figured if I gave it a year I could refinance the vehicle and switch it out for a newer one .. Salesman Bryan was kind and helpful . Was so excited to leave the dealership when of course the Ac automatically went out so I returned the vehicle and Bryan was kind enough to fix it right away and drop off the suv cause I work an 8-5 so it was almost impossible for me to pick it up.. A month and week later the battery went out and when I called the service line the guy didn't seem to care it was 100 degrees outside and I have my two year old with me keep in mind.. The mechanic told me to call the salesman no explanation . So of course I call him and Bryan again tries to help only this time he said he's with the service manager and that I needed to call my extended warranty. I spoke with Shawn from fidelity and he was kind told me I needed to explain my situation to service manager . Called the service manager didn't care he even gave me an attitude so I called Nissan Robbin in king wood and Anthony was aweswome helped me get the battery and the rental car so I can make it to work on Monday. I wish I never went to Honda McCall I felt like I was scammed .. I put $2,000 down up spending $325 this following week will give them $340 . I'm now going to look into switching my car sooner and going somewhere else . They didn't care that I had my baby in the car knowing how hot Texas is or that it was my only vehicle and they just left me stranded..

57,"August 16, 2016",I've tried to get my Guaranteed Asset Protection refund after paid off my vehicle before the maturity date.  The dealership charged me a 14% processing fee compared to the whole amounts ($365).  I also cannot find any written statement about the cancellation fee on the policy. The financial manager who sell me the policy did not told me there will be a fee imposed during the cancellation.  I was also told there will not be any penalty when paid off early.  They also miscalculated the covered period by over one and a half months after I paid off the vehicle. There is an overcharge on the coverage.  I contacted the Financial Manager Mr. Ken who submitted the cancellation request on  behalf of me to insurance company.  He refused to look into the case.  I asked the General Manager.  He declined his responsibility on it.  He told me it solely decided by the insurance company.  The dealership sent me a copy of the cancellation form with the wrong information and charges but refused to correct it. It is a SCAM!,1.0

64,"July 01, 2015","As per Sterling McCall Honda Kingwood’s request for my review, I can only categorize and review this “business” and the “service” we experienced as horrible and unethical! Sterling McCall Honda Kingwood ruined our transmission as they did not put the correct amount of transmission fluid back in our vehicle after a transmission service as per Honda guidelines. I have filed a formal complaint with Honda USA. If I could rate this dealership a 0, I would. This is my first review of Sterling McCall Honda Kingwood; a follow-up review will follow shortly upon submission of my formal complaint to the BBB, NHTSA, and the Texas Attorney General’s Office. I will provide a link so you may see my formal complaints and everything they entail. It is my opinion this dealership is unethical and run by a manager who has no integrity. Morally, I cannot and will not recommend this dealership to anyone. My recommendation to anyone who does business with this dealership’s service department is to request all parts be saved for your review and to check all of your fluid levels before leaving. I will never trust this dealership again - they have more than proven to me they cannot be trusted. I typically do not write reviews but after learning an extremely expensive lesson, as this dealership and its manager do not want to take responsibility for the damage they caused to our vehicle, I felt I had an obligation to write this review.

66,"May 31, 2015","I bought my first brand new car ever from Janice for my future wife and I. Well let's face it, it's more hers than mine. Janice was just as new as our car was to the dealership and she did a good job. 

We bought our 2014 Civic in November 2014 and 5 months later, and only 3,490 miles, we went in for a preventative oil change (free 1st one) because we are moving to Ohio this week and driving the car there. Their service express manager shows me an otherwise perfectly new looking tire on my car with no damage to it except a bubbling sidewall and tells me road damaged tires aren't covered by Honda and my vehicle is unsafe to drive. He then tells me I need a $160 new tire. I told him we never hit anything in that car hard enough to bow a sidewall. There's no tire scuffs or rim damage. He tells me the damage to the tire doesnt have to be visible for it to be road damaged. 

So after a LOT of argument, and him stating no other manager is at the dealership that Saturday but him, he drops the price to $140. Oh, and did I mention our turn signal camera ceased working properly on our new car as well? Yep. 5 months old and needing a new tire and electronic equipment failing in our Civic. 

New tire later. Driving the car Sunday, 1 day after the ""NEW"" tire is on it. Tire pressure sensor comes on. We check the new tire. The rubber on the supposed new tire is peeling off the sidewalls and inside the tire. Literally peeling. Going back on Monday to demand my money back and for them to make this right. I should have never been charged in the 1st place for a tire, and this shows the ones they are using are unsafe and defective. 

I'm going to be calling Honda corporate and lodging a complaint against this dealership and it's shady mechanics manager and cars. Apparently they are willing to lose a first time Honda customer by selling cars with tires that can kill them and then blame the customer.",1.0

68,"February 04, 2014","I bought a 2011 Honda Accord July of 2013. At that time I was told the car was Certified, to discover when I went for service at another dealership, the vehicle was not certified. There was a gas in a tire when I bought the carhich I was told was cosmetic, but the service said it was a road hazard. The car has been certified since I purchased it but I'm not sure the certification was properly done, considering is been serviced over 15 times in 5 months. Brakes, rotors, ball joints, and most recently the alternator. This car has issues that I'm sure they were aware of but failed to disclose at time of purchase. I've spoke to everyone from the sales manager, shop Foreman, to the General manager, and their solution to this problem is for me to buy another car from them.

I asked Bob to meticulously describe the vehicle as if he was about to fly 450 miles to purchase it himself. He did exactly that. He personally drove to the airport to pick me up. He even filled the tank to start me on my way home. This car was in even better condition than I had hoped. It was a couple thousand less than anything else comparable online and several thousand below retail. Gregg in Finance was pleasant and didn't try to force a bunch of extras on me.

They got a great civic in (perfect, for a civic), but I wasn't entirely sold without driving a CRZ. It was just a lot of money for a civic. I told them that, and Nam said that they couldn't tell me when they'd get a CRZ and that if I liked the civic then I'd better buy it fast because they couldn't guarantee they'd get another like it anytime soon. I felt very pressured. I asked if they could get a CRZ from another dealership for me to drive, and they wanted to charge me a transport fee. I'm not paying a (most likely) $400 fee to drive a car when I can just drive across town and do it there! Found the CRZ across town and bought it there. Love the car.

84,"February 01, 2011","Larry Davis is the Sales person who sold me my new Honda Civic. I had pondered the thought but really had no idea that I was ready to purchase a new car and truthfully, I dreaded going to a dealer and having all those salesmen approach me. Past experiences with car salesmen and dealers have ranked right up there with my worse nightmares.  That is one reason why I kept my old car for so long.  I guess that is also why I decided to do some online shopping.  I spoke with the online manager and then with Larry.  It was nice that when I went, I could ask for Larry Davis by name and he (and only he) promptly came to meet me at the front desk, how professional.  I had never bought a ""foreign"" car before but I had heard from many friends about what a great car a Honda is.  I was very curious.

Still skeptical and wanting to avoid any ""high pressure sales pitch', I told Larry up front that I was not an easy person to do business with.  Still, he was courteous and patient.  He took time to explain the possitives about being a Honda owner.  He knew his product and turned out to be the perfect salesman for me.  He did not pressure me in any way.  We agreed on a sales price and a price for my trade-in, both very fair. In past times, this part of the transaction usually left me angry and leaving the dealership, swearing that I would drive my old car until the wheels fell off.  Then, Larry sent me to David in finance and this was also a good experience as it did not take the hours I had anticipated.  Actually, it took about an hour, if that.

I traded in a large luxury car and expected to have withdrawals about going from a big car to this small one but decided that if I was going to buy a new car my first priority would be to save gas, comfort would not be a key factor. Just one more pre-conceived notion.  The car is very comfortable and fun to drive.  At my age, I can use all the ""fun"" I can find!

In short, car purchasing does not have to be the most dreaded thing in life.  I think that the personnel of a dealership exemplifies the dealer you are doing business with.  That probably goes for every aspect, including the service dept., which I have not had to use yet.",5.0

However, the horror began with Paul, the finance guy.  He began his finance spiel by trying to subtly tack on extras to the overall cost of the car--most people would not even notice if they did not pay very close attention.  When I began telling him no, no and no, that is when he began to become very aggressive and strange.  He argued with me that Hondas are no better than Fords, that I might as well buy any other car, and continued to insult the Honda brand--ironic, no?  We came away from the finance experience with what we wanted, but only because I stuck to my guns.  Paul was...strange and he obviously doesn't like Honda.",4.0

This is not a cheque and funds were already withdrawn from the account. We tried to find an HSBC bank to cancel it and get cash but they seem to have closed in Houston. 

We asked the dealer to take it to their bank to cash, but Corporate would not allow it.  We had to have a wire transfer done to Honda corporate and wait while it was acknowledged.  Luckily we had enough funds to cover the purchase price twice. 

It took 2 days to purchase the vehicle and we had to cover Corporate's $20 fee to receive a wire transfer.  I suppose they wanted a suitcase full of money.

I made an appointment for a test drive and really liked the Honda Accord. Never during the time was I pressured. Mr. Ali has a very good demeanor and appears to know his product. I told him I would be back on Monday to make the deal. He didn't ask me for a deposit or anything. I really liked that. 
 I came back on Monday and he had the car already detailed. This was not 100% sure I was going to come back. I guess he felt that he had given me a good deal.
 The next step was seeing the Finance guy which I normally dread, because that's where they try sell you everything from tinted glass to hubcap cleaner. 
 He was a very pleasant and very well educated individual. He did not pressure me. He showed me the options that were available but never did I feel uncomfortable. He even gave me some very good advice for my son which is a senior at UT Austin.

If you see a similar vehicle w/similar miles print the ad and bring it to Raphael @ Sterling McCall Honda! I'll beat the deal by at least $100! Call Raphael Ali @ (888) 878-4958 for a quick & painless purchase experience! Please call for more information."" I got on the internet and printed several ads with prices as much as $4,000 lower. They were from all over the country including San Antonio and Louisiana. I drove the car, loved it and asked what we could do. Raphael invited my husband and I into his office where he told me the internet price which is what he ""owns it at"" was $19,990. I took out my ads and put them on the desk and he immediately said that he couldn't beat the deal. The prices would have to be on cars in the area. (Didn't say that in the ad!) He took the price from the car located in San Antonio which was $3,000 less than his and went to speak to his manager and said he'd ""try"", but he knew he wouldn't be able to sell the car at the price it would take to beat the deal I had printed out. After several minutes, Raphael came back and offered the car for $600 less than the $19,990 that he had advertised it on the website. He told us that the statement that he'd beat the deal by at least $100 meant that he'd beat his own deal. That makes absolutely no senses and definitely is NOT what the ad states. My husband stated that this would be considered false advertisement, to which Raphael replied ""no, it's not."" Raphael tried adding stipulations to the ad, but no such stipulations were included in the ad, and there was not a disclaimer stating that the car had to be in a specific area, or that the ability to beat the deal would depend upon how much he ""owns it"" for. It's all BS, and he's not heard the last from me. If you advertise something such as this any stipulations, or specifications that would void the deal would have to be listed somewhere in the ad, or shown as a disclaimer. I will be speaking to someone else at Sterling McCall Honda and if I can't get any satisfaction by doing so, I will contact the Attorney General's Office. This IS false advertisement at it's finest, and I have no intentions of dropping this. If he thought he'd seen or heard the last from me when I walked out of the dealership, he's WRONG! It's not over until there is no further recourse, Raphael. Remember my name, you'll be cursing me later....
