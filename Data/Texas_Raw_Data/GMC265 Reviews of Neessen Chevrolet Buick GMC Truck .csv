0,"February 28, 2020","Went in to look at purchasing a vehicle and had the unpleasant experience of having Lalo Galvan try and lecture me on how a car buyer should act. Having bought 3 vehicles from this dealership, and 5 from others I guess the buyers they want are the uneducated ones. ",1.0
1,"June 01, 2019",Went in to see a used car with I saw online hoping to get a great deal on a vehicle. The salesman let me drive the vehicle a little bit longer to really get the feel of the vehicle. I would give him that. The vehicle had two bad tires on it. The salesman said he would talk to the manager to get them changed. Asked him if they could do better on the price and he said no. Wouldn’t even ask his manager. He advised that he would not call me for a lower price on the vehicle and if I wanted it to come back and see him. The vehicle has been on the lot for over 250 days. I would think that they could work with the price a little bit. ,2.0

Isales person was with another customer before finishing up with me. The car ran out of gas onmy way home. I was told an oul change ind inspection of the car came with the auto buttler service, it does not. Now I’m being told the can only perform this service during normal working hours, so now I have to take time off from work to get this service done. I guess you guys will tell a customer anything to make a sale",3.2

Walked up to me and introduce himself and asked what I was looking for. I explained to him and next thing you knew, I was driving out of there with a 2018 Camaro! Everything went smoothly and he did awesome! If I ever need another vehicle, I'd return to him for the help again. Thanks again!",5.0
9,"September 10, 2018","We started working with Victor as our salesman in August. He listened, worked with us and provided outstanding service to us. He was a true gentleman. It is very rare that you find a gentleman that will go out of his way to open a door for a lady all the time. I truly hope Neesen realizes what an awesome salesman and employee Victor is. He makes your dealership shine. Victor went out of his way to keep in touch with us and help us find the right vehicle for us. He was patient while we test drove several vehicles. Thank you for working with us and providing excellent service. Roy handled the financing end of the sale and he provided professional courteous service and did an excellent job also. Please note that we originally tried working with coach but he did not seem interested in working with us for the sale, which is why Victor was a breath of fresh air for us. We have bought several vehicles from Neesen Chevrolet and we enjoy working with this dealership and were very glad we were able to continue our tradition of faithful Neesen Chevrolet customers.",5.0

She definitely went above and beyond.  We asked her to walk us thru setting up the On Star and without hesitation, that’s exactly what she did. She sat in our vehicle with us talked to the On Star operator and helped with all the set up. Having three kids with us that’s definitely meant a lot to us to be able to just drive off and have it all set and done! She help put us in a car that fits all our needs and extremely happy with my Acadia Denali purchase. We will be returning to her and I will send friends and family for all their vehicle needs.

31,"August 22, 2018","1st time Neessen buyer. I  Usually shop local as I live in Corpus Christi, TX. But the way Sarah and her Management treated me and my wife,  starting from listening to exactly what I wanted and actually having the exact vehicle in stock,  respecting  what I wanted from the deal,  to showing me the entire service department and promise,  I Gotta say I’ll  be buying from here from now on. These people showed me a laid back  atmosphere but at the same time a high level of professionalism.  The vehicle was super clean but Sarah still promised me a full detail.  Went back about a week later and within 2 hours they sure did make it super shiny and even gassed it up for me. My wife, my Dog 🐕 (Rottweiler) and I are very happy with the new compact SUV 🚙 (2018 Chevy Equinox) and are looking forward to riding in it on many road trips together.  Very happy to have taken the short drive to Kingsville.  I will definitely be recommending  this dealership to all my friends and family when they are looking for something new. ",5.0

59,"July 28, 2018",I'm sure this happens at most dealerships but this one seemed to not have the vehicles displayed on the internet in stock.  Hope that the bait and switch game wasn't being played.  Was told that the vehicles had been sold and take a while to drop off website but the one I bought dropped off in less than 24 hrs.  Was also told that the price couldn't be budged from due to the parts and labor put into vehicle but the service history showed nothing had actually been replaced or fixed.

75,"July 13, 2018",I responded to an email from the internet sales rep who was just checking up on my status from 6 months earlier when I told her I was waiting a little longer to purchase a vehicle. It just happened to be perfect timing and I sent her what I would be interested in doing. The following day (I work nights so it was a late email) I recieved a call from a man named Odell. Odell was on the ball And set me up with a time to come in. He was nothing but professional and made me comfortable in the dealership. Any questions I had he had an answer and he did his job flawlessly. I knew from the website exactly what truck I liked and that’s the truck I drove off the lot in. I was satisfied with my trades and I was given more than blue book on the car I traded. There were no secrets or shady actions like I have experienced at the other dealership in Kingsville Texas (Sames). In typical Texas fashion there was a BBQ during the day at the dealership and they were sure I got some food while the paper work was being finalized. I am satisfied with how. The whole experience went and if I was staying in Texas longer (I’m military so I’m transferring this year) I would return for all of my automotive needs. I also will refer all of my co workers who are looking to get a Chevy to Odell. Also Roy! That man is great at what he does but I only worked with him briefly. ,5.0

92,"July 07, 2018","My husband and i saw the truck online and we liked it. We decided to contact the dealership to see if it was still available and it was. We then proceeded to engage in a text conversation with the sales person
 We notified him that we were interested in the truck but that we had seen one similar closer to home, the difference was the color. (My husband didn't like the color of the truck that was closer to home) but that truck was $1000 cheaper. We asked the sales representative if they could offer us a good enough deal to make the drive to kingsville. We live in mission texas so the drive is about an 1hr and 45 minutes. We made it very clear that we would make the drive only if they could work on lowering the price a little bit.  The sales person assured us that his sales manager could make that happen. So we make the almost 2 hour drive to kingsville to find ourselves looking at an increase on price, AN INCREASE ON THE PRICE OF THE TRUCK!!! I was blown away, I had never in my life delt with a dealership who advertised a price to only change once they got the customer in. As you can understand I was completely thrown off by the new charges. The sales rep then proceeded to explain to me what those were.  A charge for a number engraved  in the glass and a paint coat.  THOSE CHARGES WERE NOT CLEARLY IDENTIFIED OR ADVERTISED ON THE WEBSITE.  yes in small print it did say, in a very generic tone,  that some vehicles might have extra chargers, but I thought, like any other normal customer,  that those fees would be taxes and title or a warranty or something like that. So that's why I accuse this dealership of using FALSE ADVERTISEMENTI to lore people in. 
",2.6
93,"July 06, 2018",It was good over all.  I guess the only thing that bothered me was when I asked to have my tires aired.  While the tires were being aired I noticed that the system was showing the front not the back tires were being aired.  I know that happens when the tires are rotated but when I told the young man about the issue he said that he did not have the tool to correct the air pressure readings.  He did not show an indication that he wanted to get the tool needed.  I know I should have made more of a request at the time.  I will probably return to get it corrected.  Again I really enjoy taking my vehicle to Neessen for service.,5.0

He stuck with me and we worked they the details and I cannot express how much gratitude I have towards him. He knew his stuff when it came down to paperwork. I went in a couple days later to pick my car up and sign paperwork (well after their hours) and not 1 of the people in the office (sales manager, associate, and financing guy) all had smiles on their faces. I couldn’t be more pleased knowing I bought my vehicle at an awesome price and got helped by one of the most patient groups of people.
