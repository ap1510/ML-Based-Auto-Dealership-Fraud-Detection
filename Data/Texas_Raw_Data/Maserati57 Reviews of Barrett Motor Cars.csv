3,"January 31, 2020",First service on my F-Pace and first time visiting this dealership.  Everyone was courteous and friendly and service was exceptionally fast.  They even took a few minutes to walk me through some feature on my vehicle I hadn't used before and updated the software to boot!  Excited for the next 15k mile visit!,5.0

5,"January 27, 2020","Beautiful new location near Boerne.  Very attentive.  No issues whatsoever after several purchases over the years.  The Jaguar product is now one of the finest ever, with great attention to interior details and high mileage very fast engines.  The V-6 turbo is amazing.  The V-8 even more so, I've had both.  They've captured the past and made it bulletproof under the investment of Tata.  A lesson for all to learn, you can have luxury and power and drive like a spots car in any model.  I would have to move to a Bentley to top my XJL, and then bang for the buck would come in to p[ay.  The SUV model F-Pace runs and handles like an F type, and may be the best looking in its class.  I've had people stop and stare in parking lots and ask about it.

9,"October 26, 2019","Our 2012 Jaguar XF has been at Barrett Jaguar Boerne, Texas for over two weeks now.
The service advisor states they are waiting on a part.for the gas tank. A week earlier the car was repaired
due to gas fumes in the car. The cost was $900.00. Now, (a eek later) we have a problem with the gas guage not reading appropriately. The part on order is a gas tank assembly with a part in it to fix the gas gauage. The cost to us is now $1800.00 when the gas gauge is repaired. Our concern is, will this fix the problem and why was this not identified when the issue with the gas fumes was being repaired? Please advise.

15,"July 22, 2019","I cannot say enough about Barrett generally and Jason and Rafael in particular. They made my purchase absolutely seamless. I bought a pre-owned entry-level domestic trade-in, but they treated me as if I were there to buy one of their top of the line luxury cars. This is the 6th car I've purchased over the past 25 years and it was the single best experience I've had.",5.0

17,"July 16, 2019","I came back to Land Rover for my third Land Rover.
I chose Boerne because I had excellent, friendly and respectful communication with Land Rover of Boerne’s  sales Manager Dale Haynes from when I bought the third of my five Porsches. 
What I discovered was that Land Rover of Boerne has the most friendly, efficient and without doubt 
EXPERT in the Land  Rover product this side of the Pond, Barry Davis. 
Barrett Motors  should put him out front on their Marketing Program. 
Additionally, the salesman who first greeted me and followed through to the close Andy Osorno
was exceptionally able and was a pleasure with whom to work. 
The paperwork was a breeze in part because of the F&I guy Albert. 
I look forward to a long mutually enjoyable relationship with LAND ROVER  OF BOERNE.  ",5.0
18,"July 15, 2019",Wanted to test drive/ check out the Alfa Romeo and dropped by after a long day of car shopping. Our lease on a Mercedes GLC is up soon and we wanted to see what else was out there. They have an amazing selection of Maserati and Alfa Romeo cars. Maserati is nice if you can afford it but the Alfa Romeo was more our speed. The atmosphere at the dealership was relaxed and welcoming. No high pressure but not snooty either. Jerry met us and asked what we were in looking for. In no time at all we found a car we liked and took a test drive. We didn't buy that day or buy that car but when we came back a few days latter they had one that ticked all out boxes. We had a wonderful experience and love the car.,4.8

21,"May 19, 2019","I have had continued problems with my 2017 FPace.  The majority of the problems stem from the diesel engine,.  I have had to have the car towed back from Ft Stockton due to broken motor mounts and the last time in was in I was told the turbo charger was not working.  The turbo charger was replaced but I had the check engine light come on before I had gone 30 miles.  I was on my way out of town for an extended road trip so I continued, but was worried the entire time.  I brought the car in again May 7th, and I am currently waiting to see what is the statue of my car as it is still in your facility.",3.2
22,"May 13, 2019","We have bought 1 F-Pace and 2 F-Types from Barrett Motor Cars.  Our salesperson, Jeff Harrel, is super and we could not be happier with our 2020 F-Type R that we just purchased.  What a fun car to drive and it certainly stands out!",5.0
23,"May 06, 2019","Everything was as expected. The only detail that I noticed was that they didn’t put too much attention to the detail when it comes to clean the car. I can get a lot better service at any of the regular car washers.

31,"August 29, 2018","Even with months of advance notice, Barrett Motors San Antonio was still unable to provide loaner?!?.  Given the high traffic location near I-10, this has got to be a priority customer service concern.  Consequently, the Staff appeared to be overwhelmed and unresponsive. Once I arrived, no one knew anything about my appointment that had been made 2 months ago!  Finally, they agreed to fit me in sometime during the day.  The reason for the confusion?  ""The person who made my appointment no longer worked there.""  How is that MY PROBLEM?!?!  Upon completion of the work on my 2017 F-Pace, I waited for hours without interaction or feedback from the staff.  While walking around the dealership, I spotted my vehicle in the parking lot...with my licence plates and inquired whether it was mine.  After asking 4 different customer service personnel , someone finally agreed that was indeed my car! (in the parking lot out front)  If you have a Jaguar that needs to be serviced, seriously evaluate how far you are from Austin.
Bottom Line:  Barrett Motors San Antonio...Top-Notch Cars / Customer Service...Bottom Shelf",2.6
32,"July 23, 2018","My vehicle was at your shop for almost a month, apparently it was very difficult to determine the problem. My bill was about $9000.00 which was a little difficult for me to believe that a car of that quality and only 88000 miles would require such a major issue. I have other vehicles that have a 100,000miles plus some over 200,000 miles and never had such a major problem.
My wife and I love this vehicle for its comfort and its driving as well as its appearance.
Bobby helped me as much as he could with the cost.

40,"October 20, 2017","I had a lease on a 2015 F-Type S.  As it was coming to the end of the lease, I decided to upgrade to the R.  First of all, the performance of the S was flawless, and so far, so has that of the R. 

The dealership was fantastic to work with having made the transition seamless. I would highly recommend them.  Jeff, my salesman, was superb, as were his support personnel. ",5.0

47,"May 27, 2017","During our long relationship with Barrett, we purchased five Jaguars.  The quality and the service, by any measurable standard, has been magnificent.  When issues rarely came up, the service department fixed them quickly and efficiently.  As additional validation for the five stars, we were hit from the rear on the Interstate in 2015...a devastating wreck.  Michael, Carlos...and Barrett's folks in general...treated us with sensitivity and empathy during our recovery.  When I could drive again, I bought another Jaguar from Barrett's.  They have treated us more like family than customers. There will always be debate on products...everyone has an opinion...but the quality of of the folks providing this product, for us, is without question.",4.8

I highly recommend giving these guys a chance to fulfill all of your needs. ",5.0
50,"April 13, 2017",Michael at Barrett service is fantastic. He keeps you informed about the progress of service in real time. He doesn't try to sell you stuff you don't need like Mercedes. Trust is the most important virtue that you must feel at a dealership. Michael conveys trust ,4.6

53,"December 27, 2016","I had a great experience buying my Jaguar XJ at Barrett Jaguar from Manny Garcia.  Manny is extremely knowledgeable, and I especially appreciated how much time he spent with me examining my various choices.  He has a great demeanor and is very professional.  I never felt pressured and had a wonderful car buying experience.  Everyone at Barrett was a pleasure to work with.",5.0
54,"October 14, 2016","I bought a 2005 Jaguar XJ8 L that started having multiple and repeated transmission and suspension problems two years later.  Throughout my ten year ownership I spent close to $40,000 between repairs and warranty expenses,  Two weeks ago, the car had another suspension breakdown.  I tried to bring it in for repairs and they said they were overbooked and could not service it until a week later.  I had to rent a car to go to work. When it was finally taken in for repairs a week later, I was given an estimate of $8500 in repairs.  Shocked, I asked them to make me an offer on this car,  and they responded (with a straight face) that they would buy it back for $4000 if I made the repairs ($8500) or $0 if I did not make them.  Later, I found a Jaguar service shop that agreed to perform the same repairs for $2300
So this is a company that:
1) Sells cars of poor quality (this is a car that to date has less than 80,000 miles on it and is the most problem-ridden vehicle I have ever owned)
2) Cannot service the vehicles it sells (and it is the only company in ton that sells new Jaguars) on a timely basis
3) Cannot service these vehicles at a reasonable price
3) Cannot stand behind the quality of these vehicles by even offering to buy them back at a reasonable price.
Thumbs Down!",1.4
55,"March 23, 2011","My 2004 x-type was getting close to 100,000 miles so it was time for an upgrade.  I sent my wife and daughter over to check out a pre-owned 2009 XF.  Michael Chestney was very pleasant and patient with my wife and she suggested I go check it out.  I went in later that afternoon and met with Michael.  He showed me the car I was interested in and we took a test drive.  I loved the car so we began negotiating my trade-in and the price of the 09 XF.  The entire negotiation took about 20 minutes.  Fair give and take on both sides until we agreed on a deal that was within my parameters and was fair to both sides.  10 minutes of paperwork and I was the owner of a beautiful pre-owned 09 XF.  

I have purchased over 15 vehicles (cars, rv's, and boats) in my lifetime and I have to say the experience with Michael and Barrett Motor Cars of San Antonio was one of the best.  Friendly, knowledgeable, and above all fair.  That's all you can really ask from a car dealer and Michael and Barrett hit all 3.

Thanks for the great deal and the great car!  ",5.0
56,"March 01, 2011","Purchased a 2009 XF from barrett six months ago.  It has been back in their service department NINE times because it hesitates and stalls.  Their excuse is ethanol gasoline.  I don't believe them.  If it was, every XF owner in the country would be have this issue.  Will sell this piece of junk and go back to Mercedes.
