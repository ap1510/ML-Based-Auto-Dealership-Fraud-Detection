2,"December 03, 2019","My GMC Yukon was not purchased at Covert, but I had a factory paint problem.   Mr. Alex Brickel (Service Manager) and Mr. Manny Colunga (Estimator) pursued GMC to get my paint problem corrected, even during the GMC strike.  They kept me informed, treated me professionally and were courteous in every way.  I could not be more pleased with this group.

My next vehicle will be from Covert.

3,"October 31, 2019",I took my own pre approved finance letter from Austin Telco and I still received the price that was posted online. I was never pressured to use their financing. I purchased 2 cars from Covert and used outside financing. Service department is always couteous and professional when I go for my oil changes (free). ,5.0

This dealership will only follow through with the advertised sales price only if you finance in house through them!

Do yourself a favor before calling this dealership or going in person, read this review. This review is real and happened within the past 24 hours.

Monday, September 16th
- I inquired about Coverts brand new 2019 GMC 2500 Denali pickups they have on sale for 15k off. I find their add on Cargurus.com and send them an inquiry. I recieved an email back quickly stating a salesman will be reaching out. That morning I recieve a call from Kurt(who was very helpful and knowledgeable) who asks me a few questions about my inquiry. I state I'm interested in a black truck for 55k and I would like to throw a deposit down to hold then pay 15-25k towards to purchase. I mentioned I will be out of country and will return in October to pickup the truck and finalize the deal. Later that morning Kurt let's me know the truck was sold and he has others available. So I inquire about a white truck with a few more options and 3k more on the price tag which currently has a trade in offer pending. Kurt then works with his GSM(Travis) to work up a deal. No deals are made that day as I am second on the list.

Tuesday, September 17th
- Kurt reaches out to me letting me know he is still working on a deal with his GSM. I mention I'm ready to give a deposit if the price is right. Kurt gives me an offer which is pending on the previous trade in offer on the truck. Kurt let's me know that management has told him the truck is mine if pending deal falls through which he should know by end of the day. I am later told that I'll have an answer by the next morning.

Wednesday, September 18th
- I reach out to Kurt to see what the verdict is. Kindly he responds even though come to find out it's his day off. He let's me know he is still waiting for an answer from his boss (Chris). Mid day comes around and I'm done with the games. I inquire online again and get a salesman by the name of (Ed). He also tells me the truck is available. After a few emails back and forth requesting to put a deposit down he recognizes I was already working with (Kurt). I call into Covert asking to speak with (Ed). I speak with (Ed) about the truck and my email. I let him know I would like to put a deposit down as I missed the last one and supposedly this was the last truck with the internet deal. I tell him I felt like I was getting the run around as I was told this truck was already pending sold with a trade in however he mentioned it was available. (Ed) then explains that he was the salesman that had the trade in offer but it had fell through. He also says there were alot of inquires about the truck and he had someone there in the dealership that wanted to look at it. I said well I was already 2nd in line and was ready to put down a deposit. (Ed) said ""well this person is here in person"". I said what does that make a difference I already made an offer with a deposit. (Ed) then told me that he had to take care of the customer but wouldn't hang up on me. (Ed) then told me he would transfer my call in which he did where someone picked up the phone then hung up. 
This was my last conversation with Covert Buick GMC.

If your not going to finance your vehicle through them where they can make back all there ""on sale"" money you'd better shop else where. In fact I'd suggest shopping elsewhere as I wouldn't trust these sleazy salesman. Whether (Kurt) knew the inside scoop or not just be honest and say no rather then wasting mine or your time. 

I wouldn't recommend or suggest this dealership to anyone. I'm just one potential customer do you really believe I'm the only one? Think again.

5,"September 07, 2019","I recently bought an expensive Chevrolet Tahoe Premier from this dealer.  If you intend to buy from them, line your own financing up before go8 g there.  They REALLY took advantage of me with the financing (guys name-Rob Pridy).  The sales staff was great and their service department has been even better.  But their finance group will not treat you right.... if you can’t get pre-approved.....don’t go there.  I’m in the process of refinancing which will save right $5,000.00 dollars",4.4

She found just the truck I wanted and coordinated the installation of the additional accessories I purchased. Over the two purchases my wife and I have been totally and completely satisfied. Jackie is more like a good friend, not just a salesperson.

7,"April 24, 2019","I was looking for a 2017 Grand Cherokee Summit. I'd found a 4 through the USAA Car buying website. Covert was just around the corner, so and indicated that I was interested, and hurried over to see it. Brian Cox greeted me and was very helpful, attentive, courteous, and accommodating. In addition, I received several inquires from Covert wanting to follow-up on my interest. I had to make a total of 4 trips to the dealership (to account from my wife's work schedule and my mechanics availability). Brian was very understanding and always had the vehicle ready to be picked up. We decided to purchase and worked with Finance Manager Rob Priday. He was able to get a good package from Chase, and we are now very proud owners of a 2017 Grand Cherokee Summit. We requested a 2nd key faub and the Covert Jeep Service Department (Bill Scheid) made that event quick and smooth. Great job all around!",4.8
8,"April 24, 2019","Jackie was the total professional, knowledgeable, efficient and friendly.

13,"November 29, 2018","I bought a car from these folks, was promised two free oil changes.  Took car in for second oil change and was told I had a time limit on getting those two oil changes.  Checked my paperwork from the sale and did not see any time or mileage limit on the two free oil changes.  Was totally surprised when I was charged $76 for the oil change instead of getting it for free.  To make matters worse, they send me a coupon for their regular oil change price at $49 and still charge me more!

Wrote to the general manager Cory Covert, who never responded to my message.  Pretty bad when the owner/GM does not respond to customer concerns!

I have purchased 3 vehicles from these people over the last 7 years and this is how they treat their better regular customers.  Take this to heart as this is how they will likely treat you after you buy a car from them.  Oh, and their service is very slow and their people do not communicate very well either, so take your car for service elsewhere as it will be faster, cheaper, and someone will actually give a crap if you are a customer!",1.4
14,"November 01, 2018","Back in January 2018 I started visiting the service dept. at Covert. Over a course of 9 months this service dept has attempted to repair my engine, ad have failed multiple times. Opposed to requesting a Field Engineer from GM the Service Manager Alex authorized repairs that left me with multiple return trips to the dealer, for the same engine and alike repairs. I have documentation this service department reused part(s) from previous repairs. The Dept. has taken short cuts to repair my vehicle, thus creating more engine needed repairs. Currently my engine is experiencing more problems due to the lack of better judgement. The Dept. manager does not take responsibility for their short comings, blames GM as a company as to why better practices aren't rendered.",2.6
15,"October 16, 2018","I purchased a new 2018 Yukon XL from this dealership the end of 2017. Everything about the transaction went smooth, and at the time, I would have given them a 5 star review. However, over the past few months, my front bumper started to shift, causing the metal to stick out over the wheel well, and the paint to chip. I took the car to my local GMC dealership, and the body shop thought it was strange, so cost to repair was submitted to GMC to cover as a factory defect. GMC responded saying the car was damaged in transit to the Covert dealership, therefore it would not be covered as a defect. They also brought to my attention there was a documented damage report to the front bumper of my car in GMC's national system. Covert did not disclose this information to me at the time of purchase. Covert responded they are not required to share this information with the buyer. If it is not legally required, then it is a business decision- I believe the decision to with hold pertinent information on the history of a new car is fraudulent. My recommendation to buyers approaching this dealership is to ask for the VIN number on vehicles you are considering, and run the number by GMC to check there is no prior history on record that you should be aware of when you make your purchase decision. Or shop at a dealership that is no so covert.",1.0
16,"August 29, 2018","I made an appointment for having an engine issue resolved. The dealer contacted me and told me that I would have to leave the vehicle for 3-4 days in order for them to queue up for having diagnostics run. I told them if there was a three to four day wait, then why not make the appointment for when I could get the diagnostics done on the same day. The service person then suggested that it would be 3-4 days no matter when I dropped the car off, but if I waited till the 19th of Sept, they could then provide a loaner. But that it would still take three to four days after I dropped the car off. This dealer has recently lost a deal from me and I bought this Encore at another place. I have a strong feeling that this is why they are treating me so badly. There is absolutely no reason they cannot schedule me so that the diagnostics cannot be scheduled and completed the same day, especially when I am letting the dealer choose the day for the appointment.

17,"July 08, 2018","If I could give 0 stars, I would. I had to go through management just to get them to stop the bait and switch they were trying to pull over on me. I will NEVER be buying anything from this dealership again, nor would I ever recommend such a terrible place. Now I am currently fighting for warranty issues I never even asked to be signed up for. No one is willing to help and has treated me like a joke. ",1.0
18,"May 10, 2018",Let me start by saying this has been the best sales experience I’ve had buying a used vehicle from a great dealership such as Covert. My salesman Keith Schwartz wouldn’t let certain obstacles get in our way and made the sales experience much less stressful and had a great positive attitude with me from the beginning to end. His knowledge and experience showed as he helped me get through the buying process with such ease and confidence.. I’d like to thank him again for finding me the perfect truck that I wanted and I highly recommend him and his finance team. Thanks again Covert and needless to say I will stay loyal to your dealership and looking forward to my next vehicle purchase in the future! ,5.0
19,"April 26, 2018","We were recommended to Keith by my parents. I wasn’t really in the market for a car just yet, but my mom and dad said they were super great and that Keith would take care of us. The whole process was super easy and Keith went out of his way to find the right car and at the best price possible. He actually listened unlike most salesmen. Most of the time you feel like the whole dealership is just pushing you so they can just get a sale, but that vibe did not exist here. I am soo happy with my car!!!",5.0
20,"March 23, 2018","Entire experience from Sales to Service was unpleasant. To begin with, I had been driving a GMC pickup but as I'm 62 years old, I was leaning toward an Acadia due to the ease of getting in and out of the vehicle. I was already pre-approved by my credit union so essentially had a check in my hand ready to buy. My wife and I drove both the Sierra and Acadia. This was in November of 2016 and the new 2017's were already out. This particular Sierra was a 2016 model and had been on Covert's lot for almost a year, so they were offering some good incentives. The Acadia was a 2017 model with a lot of bells and whistles, so it was going to cost more. I presented my pre-approval letter to the salesman and said that if they'd come down to my approval amount, I'd take the Acadia. When he said that management wouldn't come down to that figure, we settled on the Sierra, our second choice. This was around 7:30 or7:45 in the evening and the salesman seemed eager to go home. It took another 2 hours to complete the paperwork and we didn't even get to take the vehicle home. The finance guy kept trying to increase the amount that the salesman quoted. I found out the following day by searching their inventory online, that there were at least 4 other Acadia's on there lot that would have fallen within my budget. I believe that the salesman just wanted to make the sale so that he could go home and that Covert wanted to get rid of their older inventory. They didn't really want to sell me what I actually wanted.

It went down hill from there.

I had been in twice for service and once for warranty repairs. Basically, they were all unpleasant experiences for one reason or another. Poor service, unresolved warranty issues, not delivering when promised, etc. I kept trying though. On my third visit for service a couple of days ago, I had an 8 o'clock appointment for an oil change and tire rotation. After an hour, I noticed that my name wasn't on the status board that showed vehicles waiting, in progress, or completed. I asked the clerk about it and she said she's ask my advisor about it. After an hour and a half, my truck was finally pulled around. I probably would have been OK with this, but when I mentioned to my service advisor that it shouldn't take that long to just change the oil and rotate the tires, he starts giving me this attitude about, ""it always takes 1 1/2 hours"" as he's rolling his eyes. I know from my many years that it doesn't. I was then told that it was going to cost me $76 which came as a surprise. I have to admit that I was accustomed to the Cadillac service next door where they gave you free oil changes, tire rotations, and washes for 4 years or 48,000 miles, so I should have read the sales contract more closely. But I've had my truck for less than 2 years and I expected more. When I said that I'd be taking my vehicle elsewhere next time because it was cheaper, the service advisor continued with his attitude with, ""it would have cost you over $100 to have it done anywhere else"" in this very condescending voice.

After all of my other visits, I received a survey from GM asking to rate my experience, But, you know it's funny, after complaining to the service manager about the way I was treated and that I'd never be back, I never got that survey...",1.2
21,"February 20, 2018","I have a 2015 Yukon Denali. I dropped my vehicle off for a repair. When I picked it up, the GPS was not working. I took it back in and was told that I need a new antenna. I also had them to look at the DVD system that isn’t working (which I have already had replaced once). They are giving me a discount to fix these items, but I should not have to pay for anything since the antenna broke while in their care and the DVD has already been replaced once (and I have had the vehicle for barely 2 years). When I got my car back this time, there  was a dent in the dash. I should not have to wonder what will be broken next when I take my car to Covert!   They are supposed to fix it, not break it further! I had a 2011 Yukon Denali that I loved and didn’t have any problems with. The 2015 Yukon has had nothing but problems. It seems as if their quality is going downhill. Not only has Covert lost a customer, but GMC has as well!",1.4
22,"January 31, 2018","If I could give them zero stars, I would. I have never had so many issues with a dealership in my life. I will never buy a car from them again. And I may never buy a GMC again because of them. Everything they do and say is a lie. Their service is guaranteed to cost you in time, multiple trips for the same issue, stress, and aggravation. No accountability here. Just a steady stream of lie after lie, big and small, to your face. Black is white, gaslighting. 

The only constant and reliable thing is that they will mess up your service, and you will have walk through fire to get them to fix it. Expect at least 2-3 trips to fix the same issue. I am literally going to transfer all of my paperwork and purchase to another dealership so that I never have to deal with them again. It is truly that bad.",1.0

26,"January 26, 2018","I have purchased 7 new cars in the last 10 years and I have never been more dissapointed with an experience. The sales person was ok but the manager tried to take SERIOUS advantage of our 2 trades for one vehicle. They offered $5,200 below the poor condition NADA trade in value on one vehicle and $7,450 below poor condition NADA trade in I didn’t accept either and when we were half way home they called saying they would be fair and give us the good condition NADA values on the trades which was a difference of $14,000 they tried to unfairly take. They also market up a set of aftermarket GMC wheels 1,000 over what GMC sells them for online!!! Did they think that we wouldn’t of go and look at prices!!??

Although he was assisting another customer, he was very attentive to me and let me know he'd be with me soon. Once we got the specifics, Julie had Victor pull out a car I recently viewed online and I was able to get it at a price range that worked for me! In the past, dealership experiences for me have lasted all day. I was in and out in about 4 hrs and was approved for the vehicle I wanted and picked it up the next day! Again, Victor had a customer when I came in to pick my vehicle up but Julie came to the rescue and found another employee put my plate on to expedite everything but Victor made sure to say bye.

48,"April 19, 2017","I'm originally from Austin, TX. Life has taken me to OKC for a bit and then on to New Mexico. I mention this, because in 2015 I bought a car online from Roger Beasley Mazda. This year I thought ""it's time for a new car"". I elected to purchase a car using this 21st Century Technology, The Internet. After TWO days of working a deal, including getting pictures, VIN, personal information and being told we had a hold on a vehicle... COVERT SOLD THE VEHICLE out from under us. We weren't even notified that it was being looked at further, instead the supervisor rudely let us know ""they don't normally do deals this way"". OK - if you want a reputable buyer who is looking for a specific vehicle, they're not always going to be in the same location. When you START a deal and get personal information from a prospect, you should probably focus on closing just that one deal, or perhaps communicating the active sales status on the vehicle. Grew up hearing ""Covert is a trusted name"" guess I trusted them too much. Thanks for LITERALLY nothing, Covert Buick. Special shout outs to Nate and his supervisor for the shady wheelings!",1.2

Jamie did an incredible job answering all of my questions, getting me the best deal I had been presented and getting it all wrapped out without all of the back and forth and waiting around.  We were so happy with the one truck we bought I end up buying two more vehicles that day from him.  I will go no where else and deal with no one else going forward.

She never was pushy and did everything she could to get us the best deal possible.  She is a perfect example of what a car salesperson should be!   I will be more than happy to refer friends and/or family to her.

The staff here are so friendly and upfront with pricing that i decided to make my purchase of my new sierra with them over anyone else. I literally drove halfway across the country to make this deal happen and it was worth every mile. Jordan Casas worked tirelessly and without end until we had a deal put together that we could both live with. Unlike most sales people who try to push you to a price that makes you uncomfortable, she made the best deal she could and when that wasn't going to work for me she advised me to wait until she could get some better incentives for the vehicle I was interested in...I'll say that again, instead of being a typical pushy sales rep trying to boost numbers and get a sale she advised me TO WAIT until she could have a better opportunity to work a deal that would have a better chance of working for me and was completely honest about what she could and couldn't do for me! Dont waste your time with other dealerships who advertise with bait and switch tactics or predatory pricing, take the time out of your day and give the great staff at Covert a chance to make you a deal and ask for Jordan cause shes amazing and will do everything she can to get you driving home in that new vehicle you've always wanted.",5.0

Your other saleman and ladies at the dealership were all very friendly.  They offered me water and fruit.  This is the first dealership where I see them offering fruit which by the way was very good.  

This vehicle was a surprise to my wife and she loved it at first sight. She couldn't believe her eyes when I ran the doorbell and gave her a dozen of roses along with the keys of her new car.

Cover dealership is a Great place to buy a vehicle and I will always recommend it to all my friends and co-workers.

137,"June 21, 2016",I met the Coverts through an old friend. I needed a new Denali and wanted to sell my 2011 Denali without much hassle but wanted a fair price. I had never purchased a new car - always buying used to keep down the cost. But to my surprise the Coverts gave me an amazing deal on my trade-in and on my new 2016 4x4 Denali. They even went out of their way to help me get rid of another vehicle to make the sale work. Everyone was attentive and friendly and worked hard to ensure my complete customer satisfaction. I think the real difference maker with the dealership is that the owner really cares and is on-site watching over the staff in a friendly family oriented way.  Cory Covert and Josh Lester were both amazing. Justin Sullins was the best with such a wonderful personality and demeanor. I definitely recommend Covert Buick GMC Austin for your next automobile purchase. And don't hesitate to compare your options between new and used - you may be surprised that buying new with or without a trade-in could look better on paper than you think. And you get to leave with a never used automobile!,5.0

Fortunately for me they're right down the road.  I arrived at the dealership and literally almost ran into our salesman, Mark Welch, as i was turning a corner.  He immediately met me with a smile and i could tell he had a winning personality.  After looking around a bit i decided to seek him out.  Mark was busy making copies and i asked him if he wanted to sell me a car.  Long story short, he said he would and Mark was excellent in every way.  He was genuinely likable, thorough, and knew his product.  My wife and i are completely satisfied with our buying experience and would gladly buy another vehicle from Covert in the future.

178,"January 07, 2016","My daughter and I spent four hours choosing, test driving and filling out paperwork on a used vehicle at Covert. We got the financing underway and signed a stack of papers for the “Sale” explicitly because they had to account for the sale at year end or so we were told. I also left a 1000.00 deposit to secure the car and based on my credit report, they wasted no time checking my credit.

The car had a mechanical problem that was to be fixed, so we were told to return to complete the financing and pick up the car. Or so we thought. 

When we returned, the car was “no longer available”, It had been SOLD TO SOMEONE ELSE. According to them, the sale wasn’t complete because the financing wasn’t finished even though I sat with the finance officer, signed all the paperwork and was not told, in any way, that the car might be sold from underneath us if financing was not completed then and there. Our intent was to return when the car was ready and cosign the note to help develop our daughters credit.

Somewhere along the line, Peter didn’t tell Paul that the car was committed to us. I don’t know what you call it, I call it gross incompetence and just plain bad customer service. To add insult to injury, no apology was offered, no alternative or option, no “can we call you if another car like it comes up?”. Nada.. 

So we drove over 100 miles making two trips, spent hours in the process and even got a credit ding. All for nothing because, of the dozens of people at Covert, they couldn’t manage mark this car sold. Yes, I’m angry.

Ricardo took the time to make sure that I had all my stuff out of my trade and understood all the controls on the new vehicle. He helped me get OnStar setup and even paired my phone.

The manager in the sales department went so far as to upmark and remove the complimentary window tint because he was ""upset"" about us not signing the paperwork at 10pm to finalize the deal. I've never felt so outraged about the lack of quality in service in my life. The higher in the chain of command, the less respectful they ar . If you want to fix something, then I guess you're just out of luck with covert. I've never been treated differently just because I didn't have a suit on, until I met these people. ",1.6

I then received an email from Mark Welch aka ""Cowboy"" as there are a few Marks there. Mark called me which I missed his call so he texted me as well. When I got to the dealership at about almost 7pm I was lead to where ""Cowboy"" sits. VERY NICE!!!! Immediately we went and test drove the car that I was interested in and we talked. Once we got back to the dealership I told him that this was the car that I wanted and we started the paperwork. He was very knowledgeable and NEVER once did I feel that I was dealing with a sales person just trying to make commission. ""Cowboy"" made the experience truly one of the best experiences for me in regards to buying a vehicle. Shortly after 8pm, I was lead to the sitting area so that finance could put everything together. This is when I met with Jennifer. She was great in getting the numbers where I was comfortable and was able to work her MAGIC. Once in her office, everything went smooth and quickly.

Early the next day he sent further pertinent information via email that could help us make an informed decision.    Because of his exceptional service , knowledge and attention to detail, we returned the following day entertaining the idea of possibly purchasing the vehicle we were considering.  His depth of knowledge and assistance during a test drive of the vehicle firmed up our decision to buy a vehicle through the Covert Dealership.

He took three hours with me to fully go through each model and point out the features (not counting the time we took test driving other makes). There was no pushy car salesman persona whatsoever. Mark's patience and enthusiasm for his customers really made this the best car buying experience I've ever had. 

I went with the certified pre-owned, which had a chip in the windshield. I made sure to negotiate getting it repaired as part of the deal. Covert's repair guy took a look (after the sale) and determined it wasn't repairable. Covert put a brand new windshield in for me!

The entire process was handled professionally by both Cathy and the finance person, and in a very short period of time, I was driving out in the SUV I wanted.  I cannot recommend Cathy highly enough.  She never had to go ""speak with her manager"" or any of the other silly games many dealerships play.  She knew what she could do and handled it herself.

They were quick and very respectful of our busy life, and were even kind enough to deliver my new car to my house as our baby was under the weather - that in itself speaks volumes!

263,"March 21, 2014","We have recently purchased two new vehicles from Paul Sicotte at Covert Buick & GMC.  We went to Covert initially because of their competitive pricing that was advertised.  Having had some bad experiences while new car shopping in the past, we were skeptical the deal would not be as advertised.  We were pleasantly surprised with Paul and the team at Covert.  They were very transparent with pricing and all charges were as advertised.  The deal was straight-forward and no-nonsense.  Paul made it a smooth and stress-free experience.

Also, the follow-up support by Paul has been great.  He has worked with us to resolve any questions/concerns after the sale.

After the first purchase (Jun 2013), we were happy enough with our experience with Paul at Covert to purchase another vehicle from him about six months after the first (Feb 2014).

My schedule did not permit me a 4 hour Saturday at the dealer and Ricardo did a great job of working around my schedule.  He was quick to reply to emails that I sent and was always available by phone.  

I was looking for a specific option package in a specific color that they did not have in stock.  Ricardo found a truck that matched what I was looking for, but suggested thought I might want to check out a different color.  Great advise and we were able to find one in stock in a different color.

A friend of mine who purchased a GMC truck last year recommended Covert. I normally research everything about a vehicle before I test drive, but this time I decided just to stop by. I met Bernadette and she made me feel right at home. She was friendly and knowledgeable. She didn't seem to mind that I wasn't sure what I wanted. She showed me a bunch of different trucks, explaining the various features and the differences between them. She also helped me calculate how much towing capacity I needed. 

I expected to be intimidated shopping for a truck, but I wasn't! I didn't feel rushed or pressured like I have at other dealerships. I know she has other customers, but I felt like Bernadette would have spent all day answering my questions. You can't pay for that kind of service.

I completed an online survey after delivery of the car, and unfortunately didn't remember Paul completing some of the items mentioned in the survey (chalk it up to old age).

283,"January 04, 2014","I was interested in purchasing a new car from covert. I found a price online which was lower than what they were actually selling it for. They did agree to honor the online price. However, now I know why. I was trading in a jeep that was in great condition, fully loaded and low miles....they offered me 11k for the trade (which was a minimum of at least 2400 less than the other 7 trade values I received from other dealerships). They told me they would sell my car for 13900.....I thought that was low. So I looked at their used car list. They were selling a jeep which was one year older and had 50k more miles and it was the BASIC version for 12900...yet they would sell my 15k fully loaded for 13900....I don't think so. Not only is this offer insulting...but I had my wife leave work early and we took my 4 month old baby 45 minutes to go buy a car (the online price would only be honored that day they said). The online price was only about 2600 less than the actual listing price (it was considered new...but was the loaner car they gave out with 5000 miles). I realized the reason for the low offer on my jeep was to make up for their listing error...trying to make up for it on the back end. Not only did they take a super long 4 minutes to appraise my jeep....they asked NO questions about what the jeep had (I brought the original sticker which they didn't even look at). This was the worst experience I have ever had car shopping and completely insulted by their ""we will honor the price but make it back from you by offering a terrible trade value"". Not to mention they said since the price was an error they would NOT give me their teacher discount that they give because of it. Good thing delta airlines doesn't operate like covert...otherwise the people who benefited from the error in ticket price would be paying hundreds of dollars for checked baggage and drinks on board.

The finance manager even tried to help us get a lower interest rate. I gave the ratings I did because we were satisfied with the customer service, efficiency, and knowledge of our salesman and finance manager. After the deal was finalized, our vehicle had to be serviced and would not be ready until the next business day. We were offered a rental over the weekend until our vehicle was ready. We are currently living in Killeen, TX which is about an hour from Austin because my husband is currently in the army and stationed in Fort Hood right now. They made it so convenient for us the entire process. We are truly satisfied with our purchase, customer service, and experience and will definitely refer friends and family. ",5.0
310,"July 12, 2013","I called Covert GMC to inquire about purchasing a new 2013 GMC Sierra 2500HD truck on July1,2013.  On my initial conversation with the dealership I stated I would need to trade in my 2004 Corvette to purchase their new truck.  After less that 15 minutes on the phone with Covert GMC it was mutually agreed that selling my Corvette outright was my best option, then I would be free to contact them on a cash deal for a new 2013 GMC Sierra. Okay, I respected them being upfront and looking out for my best interest.

A few days went by and I received an email from one of their salesmen, Josh Lester.  Josh stated that his dealership was now offering an additional $2000 in discounts on all 2013 GMC 2500HD trucks.  After that news I started trying to make things work on my end to secure a loan at my local credit union and purchase their truck, then sell my Corvette outright sometime in the near future, hopefully .

I received a few more emails from Josh, during one of those emails I responded that I was ready to accept the new discounted offer from Covert GMC, and I would need to know what the bottom line cash price would be with my ""GM Supplier Discount"" applied.  From that point on things between Covert GMC, Josh Lester, and myself went downhill. 

After a few more emails back and forth it was obvious a transaction on a new truck with Covert GMC would never happen.  Communications with Josh Lester came to a halt.  I then contacted Covert GMC General Manager, Cory Covert, and explained I wanted to continue negotiations on purchasing the new GMC truck but at the present time his salesman was not communicating with me.  Within one hour of that email with Cory Covert, his salesman Josh contacted me by email. Josh stated that in the morning he would supply me with all the invoices, papers, and any other information I would need to make my decision.  Well.....long story short......the next morning I received the same ""old news"".   Covert GMC stated the new discounts they were offering were outstanding (which I agree they were), but again I had made it clear from the start that I would be needing to use my ""GM Supplier Discount"" in order to make any deal with their dealership workout.  This morning, July 11, 2013, I received the totally expected news that Covert GMC would accept the advertised discount price stated here on AutoTrader.com and that I was getting a better deal that if I used my ""GM Supplier Discount"" . Great, it took this dealership 10 days of phone calls, emails and going back and forth on the computer to inform me that using the ""GM Supplier Discount"" was a worse transaction than their advertised price on AutoTrader.com.  Josh Lester wrote in an email to me after our transaction had fell apart that what we had was ""just a miscommunication"".  Had Covert GMC stated that information 10 days ago I would have walked away with some respect for their dealership, but after 10 days of going in circles, I decided to call the GMC Customer Service Department and report everything which had transpired over the last week and a half.  The GMC Customer Service Dept. was very helpful and I do appreciate their concern.......but at the end of the day......a painful lesson learned. 

I would not recommend this GMC Dealership to anyone!    And that is not ""just a miscommunication""",2.7
311,"June 24, 2013","After shopping tons of different car dealerships for the right family car and dealing with pushy, uneducated salespeople a friend of mine referred me to the Coverts.
Our salesman Wayne listened to our needs and showed us a new Acadia that fit exactly what we wanted. He didn't try to push us into what he wanted to sell or the top of the line model by using a cheesy car dealer canned pitch like the other dealers in town. They gave us a great upfront price, what we asked for for our trade and treated us like family. We met with Cory Covert and Josh Lee who were equally accommodating and again didn't try an of the usual car dealer tricks. Being in sales myself I can appreciate others that do the right thing and I now understand why the Coverts have been in business a hundred years. We are customers for life and would recommend this dealership to anyone looking to buy a new GMC.

312,"June 19, 2013","HOW CAR BUYING SHOULD BE! I don't like games dealers play nor do I like wasting my time playing their games. I had done my research online and found what I wanted as well as researched my trade-in. Eddie demonstrated the vehicle I was looking to purchase and I was impressed of his knowledge to be honest! I shared with him the number I was willing to purchase for as well as the number I was willing to trade for. There weren't any back and forth games... Eddie did ask where I had done my research (I would imagine to ensure their advertising was in the right place). Eddie returned approx. 10-15 min later and they were willing and eager to earn my business. I informed Bill in finance I had pre-arranged my finance. He asked if he could earn the opportunity to save me some $$ on the rate. I explained if he was able to do so without additional cost to me I would be happy to. Bill was successful and in a matter of 15 minutes I was signing papers and driving home. The entire process took right at one hour and it was by far the BEST experience I have ever had.

317,"May 02, 2013","After being 6 hrs from home with a child who had received 2 days of intense treatment we experienced a flat tire.  My vehicle was only 2mo old and fully covered under manufacture warranty and road hazard warranty.  My husband worked with a VERY unprofessional Service rep. who from that morning forward refused to inquire regarding our warranty and expressed no concern for our situation. After 4 hrs of arguing and repeatedly requesting a manager and being left across the street with NO VEHICLE your service rep Tom called us and LIED regarding his efforts and our coverage for our Road Hazard. We had to leave my handicapped child and 4 yr old at the restaurant as we walked across the street to pick up my vehicle from your dealership.  

A very irrate person I was at this time and it took a nice Cadillac Sales man to produce the Service Mgr after I requested to speak with Mr Covert himself.   The service Mgr went on to explain that he just been made aware of the situation a few minutes prior(2PM). Keep in mind we had been dealing with this situation since 930AM and requesting to speak with a manager since 11AM. (4 times I requested a manager and each time they told me he was out of the office.)  The service manager proceeded to begin with explaining what he had been told by Tom, he apologized for not being aware of our situation but could NOT produce a solution nor seemed sincerely concerned with our situation. I expressed my concerns and took my keys and left.

 I WAS REQUESTED BY YOUR TEAM TO SHIP MY OWN TIRE OFF TO CLAIMS AND PAY EVERYTHING IN FULL. I was to carry this dirty tire 6 hours back home with me and pay everything to your dealership. We battled all day with your service rep TOM, even had to produce proof of coverage by calling our GREAT sales team in Weatherford, who were beside themselves that a certified GMC dealer would be so inconsiderate under the circumstances. Even after proof TOM had trouble and an Attitude with my husband to get our vehicle serviced. His hostility had me concerned for our safety in that they might not do a good job in retaliation. Trying to care for a sick child and get my family back home to Odessa safety before dark was the least of Tom's concern. He wanted MY MONEY. I never denied offering payment but wanted to check with the Road Hazard because I didn't understand why I was out of pocket since that was not the agreement in the contract.

Our Road Hazard rep explained YOUR dealership refused to send back my tire for coverage and reimbursement. They also went on to explain that NO ONE from your dealership even tried to verify coverage and this could be done simply by entering the VIN # in the computer. She kindly found me a non GMC dealership to change my tire and get us on the road home at no additional cost to me since our warranty covered EVERYTHING!! This facility was AMAZING and had us taken care of with in the hour!!! Unfortunately we had wasted all day putting faith in GMC and this dealership.

I will not recommend your SERVICE dept to ANYONE and will make it know to GMC the lack of CARE we received.  I have been a happy GMC owner since 2003 and NEVER in all my travels or routine maintenance experienced such TERRIBLE Customer Service. Worst of all I had to go to another facility to repair my brand NEW GMC Acadia and my children were exhausted after our travels as we arrived home at 2AM due to your team. It saddens me we were so far from home,in a bind, and now it worries me the service GMC dealerships may provide. I do not feel safe and will never go to this dealership again.

319,"March 04, 2013","I have purchased 3 new trucks from this dealership in the last 4 years, so far I have been unable to find a dealership to match prices and the personalities of the guys I have worked with. I live in Buda and their is a GMC dealership that is quite a bit closer than Covert, however after one visit to the service center at that dealership (only went to save 14 miles of driving) I will never step foot in that place again. They seemed cold and unwelcoming especially when they found out that my truck was purchased at another dealership. To tell the truth I almost felt like I was betraying the Covert family by going there. Now then, when I need a new truck or car I will be purchasing it from Cory, Josh, or Mike. For service, see Dave, Mark, or Ellen they are the one's I have worked with and are now considered, along with the sales team, my friends.

Both vehicles, a Sierra crew cab diesel and a Yukon Denali were purchased over the phone.

Ricardo is selfless and is there to please the customers. My husband was very pessimistic about the whole deal but when I walked up to him and said this is what Ricardo has priced your diesel at...well needless to say his jaw dropped! Especially when I told him all the extras it had. With the Yukon purchase I told Ricardo the specific second row I wanted and he had it and gave me a price immediately and with the awesome help of Bill Ferguson in financing, I had my Yukon here 3 days later!!

He never tried to show or put me in a vehicle I didn't really want, He didn't show me a different color or a different option, he only concentrated on the vehicle that I wanted.  He went above and beyond reasonable expectations to get the vehicle that I wanted delivered, even providing me a sweet  Verano loaner car until my vehicle arrived. Not only did Ricardo get the vehicle I wanted he got more than what I expected with additional upgrades. The purchasing process was comfortable, I never once felt pressured or rushed. There was no going back and forth to that mysterious back room for final price negotiation. Who's in that back room anyway? the Oracle?? The price of the vehicle was plainly listed no gimmicks no fast talk or double talk, no hidden cost or surprises, everything was transparent. The Vehicle was actually less than what I expected. Ricardo was awesome... Very informative and helpful, he's also a very funny guy although.... he did give me a bit of a hard time about parting with my cassette player in my old car, It was quite funny and I am rather old school having grown up in the 80's... I did need to step into the new millennium after all it is almost 2013.  The staff was great, I received nothing less than 1st class treatment at Covert.

I live and work in Houston and wasn't going to be able to pick up the vehicle in Austin til the following weekend.  Keep in mind I still haven't seen the vehicle in person.

The car showed up and it was just as they had represented the vehicle.  There was an issue with the bumper (that was disclosed) that needed to be repaired. They told me to bring it in the next time I was in Austin and they would repair it for me.  A few months later, I called Cory and he gave me Jeff Pray's contact information to set up the bumper repairs.  Jeff was great in answering phone calls and getting back to me on where to go and who to talk to.  One the way to Austin I started having trouble with the vehicle.  I pulled up to the service department where I was greeted by Tom Fritz.  I told all the issues to Tom and within 24 hours had a diagnosis.

340,"April 05, 2012","I was directed to this dealer through the Costco Auto Progam, so I shouldn't have had anything to worry about, right? 
It was a Tuesday afternoon when we arrive in the waiting area. I was greeted and a person went to get Ricardo. I waited for close to 10 minutes before Ricardo appeared.
Once he appeared, we exchanged greetings, but did not ask my name or what I was there for, and then he rushed off to attend to something else, with little explanation (""I'll be right back""). Within a few minutes, he was back and rushing past me in another direction, while asking if I was there to pick something up for someone else. Already this experience was not going well. I answered no, and he continued off in the other direction. He came back and finally asked what I was interested in. 
I listed four models I wanted to look at, in order to narrow down which one(s) would fit my needs best. I had done my research, but numbers don't tell you how it will look, feel, or fit. All I required was opening the car, so I could look inside at the instrument panels and seats (I'm techy and pregnant, baby seats need to fit and I need to be able to do everything I need easily, these were the things that mattered most), but apparently this seemed to be too much of a task for Ricardo. He literally pointed me in the general directions of the models, asks if we are planning to buy today and said he would catch up with us. I had answered that I wasn't sure if I was buying today, because this would be the first time I'm looking at the actual cars. I believe this is when he totally checked out. 
20-30 minutes later, after I had wondered the lot, looking in the windows of the vehicles I might be interested in, he appears. I tell him which ones I need open and the whole time I am talking and walking between the vehicles, he is doing something on his phone and only half listening. He didn't stand near the vehicle, so I am not able to ask him questions and he was not trying to highlight any features or package options. The vehicles I was looking at were all well into the $30k-40K range, so I don't believe I was wasting his time with my selections, but it sure felt like it. I finally picked a model and told him the package I wanted it equipped with, since I hadn't located it and he wasn't really offering any help. That is when he made a comment about finally getting specific enough. He hadn't asked what I had wanted at any point earlier or I could have easily told him I am looking for fully loaded and big enough to put a baby seat in easily. I can't tell you a package, if I don't know what standard features it comes with or even which model fits my needs. Again, this would have been helped with more back and forth dialog on his part, since he should know the vehicles inside and out and I am new to the models and they change every year. 
I'm irritated at this point because I have pretty much done everything for myself and I know if I buy he hasn't done anything to earn my business. Regardless, he locates what I ask for, drives it to the front of the dealership, asks for license, insurance, and rushes off to get a form for me to sign for test drive. He comes back, we sign the form and he turns us loose to drive on our own. I'm fine with test driving alone, but he didn't tell us what to do when we got back. 
After the test drive, my husband is completely happy with the vehicle and now we need to talk about purchasing, but Ricardo hasn't waited for us, or come up with another sales person and has moved on to another family. I get being busy, but at this point we have keys to a vehicle, we want to talk and we're left standing there. I had my husband give the keys back to him, while he was at his desk, which I think he barely acknowledged and we returned to stand at the front of the store, where he could clearly see us from his desk. He didn't bother to signal or anything else to indicate that he knew we were waiting. We asked another salesman if there was anything else needed from us, as we returned the keys from test drive. We wanted to make sure we didn't need any signed off that the vehicle was still in one piece when we returned it. He said no and we left.
I am very disappointed in this experience. Car buying is not normally and enjoyable experience and I am not okay with being pushed, pressured, and hassled during a car deal, but I do expect a certain level of interest and interaction from the sales person. They are there to make a sale and I shouldn't have to sell myself a car, for them to take the commission.

Eddie found me the exact vehicle I asked for with a couple of extra options (!nice!) at the price I said I would pay.  You can't beat that.  He monitored the whole sale process and even offered to come in on his day off to finish the deal.  I am extremely happy with my new 2012 GMC Terrain.  I am even happier with the entire experience at Covert.,5.0
350,"December 24, 2011","My experience with the Covert team is one that I will share with everyone interested in purchasing a vehicle. Eddie was very knowledgeable about the vehicle and provided me with information that allowed for a more informed purchasing decision. When working to complete the transaction Jeff ensured that the deal was strong for both parties. During this time Jeff and Eddie set up the expectations for after the completion of the transaction to ensure that the entire experience was complete. When working with Jerry in finance, he was able to complete the process very smooth and without error. From the time I entered the dealership until I left with my new truck the Covert team was going to ensure that I had a very good truck purchasing experience.  Thank you Eddie, Jeff and Jerry for my new truck!!!",5.0
351,"December 15, 2011","In my 54 years of purchasing cars and trucks, Eddie""s knowledge of the products he sell and his ability to explain and demonstrate how they work in detail, simply exceeds what you normally find in dealership salesmen.  He is courteous and he immediately makes you feel comfortable.  He indicates his willingness to go that extra mile to satisfy you.  Eddie is an asset to the dealership.

353,"December 12, 2011","We recently purchased a new 2011 Sierra from Covert and the whole process was hands down the best one I've ever had.  I have purchased many cars, from many dealers, and have to say that this was the most painless experience I've ever had.  Jerame treated my wife and I as friends from the moment he picked up the phone on Sunday morning. 

We came down to the dealership and took a truck for a spin to ensure that we were looking at the right one.  Jerame passed me the keys and asked me to take my time and get to know the truck.  Wow...no uncomfortable test drives!  

Once we decided what we wanted these guys went out of their way to find a vehicle for us and to ensure us the absolute best deal possible.  The whole process was so easy and painless that it made me want to find something else to buy from them.  Ha ha! 

I would recommend Covert, and especially Jerame, to ANYONE looking for a vehicle.  Covert has multiple locations and access to tons of different makes and models so I don't see any reason to go anywhere else!  

Thank you ALL for making this experience one to remember!  We will be back!

I went to this dealer to trade in my 2009 GMC Acadia for a used 2011 GMC Acadia and ended up walking out of the dealer with a new GMC Acadia. A great experience!!! ",5.0
362,"October 21, 2011","Bill Ferguson is about as down-to-earth as you can find.  He listened to me, and found just exactly what I had in mind. Instead of the usual pressure I felt when shopping around,I felt more like I was in charge of the deal. Bill and the sales manager, Jeff Pray worked to get me a better deal than I had even hoped for on the car I purchased as well as my trade-in! I have honestly never had such a pleasant car-buying experience as I've just had with those guys at Covert GMC!  ",5.0
363,"October 20, 2011","I went in looking to replace my car and I was astounded by how friendly the staff was!  I was blown away and had a great time all while I got a fantastic deal on my pre-owned Tahoe.  My trade in was in bad shape but I got more than I was expecting for it.  I was able to get a very nice upgrade with leather, DVD and a lower payment AND Ricardo had the Tahoe delivered to my house with paperwork as well!!!  I was shocked!!  I couldn't be happier and I would gladly refer all of my friends to Ricardo.  ",5.0
364,"October 06, 2011",I saw several trucks online and called to inquire about each one and Eddie answered all questions I had and worked with me to get me the right truck at a great price.

365,"August 03, 2011","I went to this dealer to buy a specific truck I saw online and Jerome ended up bring my sales ""guy"". He was very helpful and professional through the entire buying process. Two weeks after purchasing the truck, my mechanic informs me of a host of major problems with it. I called Covert and spoke with the sales manager (Jeff) and explained the situation. He told me to bring the truck back and they would work on getting me into something that was a better fit. Jerome again took me around and I settled on a newer truck with lower miles and a better engine. Jerome gave me a loaner car to use while inspections were done and even sent an employee to me to swap cars when my truck was ready! Considering the bad rap car dealers get and salespeople alike, my experience with this one was excellent. The finance guy (Chris) was very helpful in picking finance and warranty options and Jeff was very gracious an taking back the problem truck! I highly recommend these guys!",5.0

367,"June 10, 2011","This rating was based on the customer service we received on Sunday, 6/5, with reference to buying a used car for our Mother. My Mother's previous car (93 Regal) was purchased from Covert in 1998.  My older sister also purchased a used car from Covert.  Not only does this family-owned dealership provide excellent customer service, we went to school with the Coverts (Duke & Danny).  This family stands behind their business and is the only dealer we would recommend for new/used cars in Austin (our home town).  Thank you for taking care of our family.

368,"June 08, 2011","Jerame was very friendly and accomodating from the moment Cory Covert introduced him to us.  We were there to purchase a used vehicle for my mother, Margaret Dickens, who is 87 years old.  We were very impressed by the time and attention he gave us when showing us the vehicle that we were interested in.  He had gone to great lengths to get a car ready for us and it was a shame that we did not select the one that was ready because due to some mix up, the wrong car had been readied for us.  But Jerame took immediate responsibility of getting the correct car to the show area and allowed us to test drive both vehicles.  My mother selected the one that Jerame had to get at a moment's notice and had it cleaned up while we waited to sign paperwork.  He was very concerned about our delay on things, but everything worked out just fine since there were quite a number of people purchasing vehicles on Sunday, June 5, 2011.  He was a gentlemen taking care of 5 family members purchasing one vehicle.  He was very kind and shared some special moments with us while we waited.

My parents had purchased their previous car, which was a trade in, at the dealership in 1998 when it was on 5th street, and Mother only wanted to look at cars at Covert Buick this time, which says a great deal of the dealership.

We appreciate the great customer service we received and he is a great asset to Covert Buick GMC.  ",5.0

From the very beginning when I was inquiring about the vehicle, negotiating the price, delivery of the vehicle was excellent.
