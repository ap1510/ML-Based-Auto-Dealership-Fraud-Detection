0,"June 27, 2020","Horrible experience with this dealership. I looked at a 2012 Chevy Tahoe and was told to come look at it. With me being a disabled veteran I needed a bigger vehicle for my neck and back problems. Ben Camerrero was my sales person and we set up an appointment at 1600 and while my wife and I were viewing the vehicle he drove another customer around during our appointment. I thought that was very unprofessional. The vehicle had a big dent on the side and I asked would they take money off the sales price and his manager said $300 since that’s what Gunn collision would charge to fix it. I guess he thought I was young and uneducated but I’m not. I then asked if I could take it by to get a quote for the dent repair and he stated that they would get the dent fixed before we buy it. The next day he called and said they wouldn’t fix the dent because it would cost $1700 and they wouldn’t make a profit. I thought customer satisfaction was top priority at Gunn Chevrolet but this encounter was different. I then told Ben Camerrero that I felt the website should have stated that the dent was on the side and he told me no dealership would put that on their website. Huge lie because most websites will say, “Sold As Is” but Gunn Chevrolet didn’t do such a thing which to me is fraud and wasted my time driving all the way out there. Nevertheless this disabled veteran will not be going back, I’ll stick with CarMax.",1.0

6,"June 03, 2020","Dear Sir / Ma’am,
I dropped my wife’s 2015 Chevrolet Corvette in the afternoon with Michael Brown in the Service department.  I told Michael that I wanted the oil changed with synthetic, and to service a check engine light.  I gave Michael the name of my service warrenty company, and the contract number, and Michael wrote down my warrenty information. The following day, Michael called me to say the check engine light meant I had a faulty transmission cable or solenoid. Michael said it would take a few days for the part to arrive. A few days later, Michael called me to say my wife’s Corvette was repaired and ready for pick up. I asked Michael if my wife and I could pick up the Corvette on Saturday because my wife would be working late on Thursday and Friday. Michael said that wouldn’t be a problem. When my wife and I picked up the Corvette on Saturday, I noticed on the receipt that my balance was zero.  I asked the service representative if the balance was correct, and he said “yes, you don’t owe anything.”  I was expecting to at least pay for the oil change, but I wasn’t even charged for that.  I think it’s because I had to wait over a week for the transmission part to arrive. Nevertheless, I was very happy that I wasn’t charged for the oil change.
Respectfully,
David Antonio Leal",5.0

9,"May 21, 2020","Just had a simple oil change. Called before hand to ensure that a competitor price would be honored. Was told “yes” and to see Santos when I arrive.
When I dropped it off Santos was asking me why I didn’t go to the competitor for the oil change. They don’t honor competitors prices. Has to get supervisor approval?!?  I called prior to avoid all of this. ",3.0

53,"January 18, 2020","Today I went in because I had an appointment for the service engine light on my car, but the light was no longer on and I wasn't having any major complications going on with my car so I asked them to just do a multi point inspection instead since I didnt need an oil change or anything. 
Paul Trujillo was my advisor. and apparently the only one for this Saturday morning. He was getting the attitudes from the customers for it but he kept smiling, being polite, answered Everyone's questions, and I even saw him get a frustrated fizty woman to laugh. He was really good. My favorite person I encountered though today was my tech Robert Tilton. I had questions about my report and he was sound enough in his field to not just answer my questions, but also described the effects, of problems he noticed, that didn't take seriously, tell me what problems they connected to and even picked up the report I had from previous work done at a different dealership and show how the work connected. He reassured me with proof-facts, that he was trustworthy and knew what he was doing.

The service we received from Mr. Gray was excellence and Beyond.
I didn't care for my financial officer it had already been a long day  instead of just going over things we had to listen to stories about what happened to somebody else cuz they didn't get a certain insurance  bringing things up on the computer because this person didn't have the insurance and what they'd had to pay and if they had got this insurance they would only have to pay this.

142,"April 04, 2019","As a new car owner, I wanted to bring my car in for my first free engine oil change. I called ahead to ask if I needed to book an appointment and was told I could drive in, that service would be first come first serve, and that services closed at 7pm. I arrived at 5:50pm and before I could even say why I was there, I was told that I needed to leave because the service men went home. I explained how I had just called and what I had just been told. I was then told I was misinformed and that they closed at 6pm. Another worker came over to help address the situation, and said if I came back tomorrow, at any time, they’d help facilitate my oil change quickly by pushing me closer to the front of line. Together they added I could have a coupon for a free wash. I said ok and came back the next morning. When I pulled up, again before I could even say a word, a woman told me it would take 2.5-3 hours if I wanted to be seen. It bothered me I didn’t even get to tell her why I was there. There was a lot of “you should just go somewhere else” in her demeanor. It seemed like if I wanted an oil change, it wasn’t convenient at all to go to Gunn. That’s my impression still. The employees made it seem like a complicated ordeal, but when we purchased my car from the salesman only a few months ago, he made it seem like Gunn would take great care of things like this and wanted to. I could’ve gone to a Valvoline and had this taken care of so simply. It just doesn’t make sense why this happened. After I got to explain my situation, the worker told me I should’ve come earlier, then walked away to see if she could confirm what I’d shared. She came back a few minutes later and at least apologized. I wasn’t told how long I’d wait but I was told to go to the waiting room. While there, the woman I spoke with the first day saw me and kindly apologized. She really made an effort to smooth the situation over. When my car was ready, though, I had no coupon for a free wash, which is what I was promised multiple times. It just seemed like such a bizarre experience for a simple service. Why promise these things for customers if this is the follow-through? I wish I could say it was a great service but unfortunately this is what happened. As I write this review, there is no way for me to be sure I can even be contacted by someone to remedy the situation, which is also disappointing. Kevin had sold us the car and was fantastic. He was quick but thorough. We were very happy with sales. This service experience is definitely a contrast.  ",2.0

After his manager and I discussed thingd I completed the purchase. The next day Kevin while talking to my wife was rude and disrespectful when telling her she could bring the car at anytime. Before she could finish a follow up question he hung up on her. We returned the car under the Gunn 48 hour policy.

211,"October 12, 2018","This was the best new car experience my husband and I have ever had. I called Cristian to tell him we would be going to Gunn when we got off work to look at one of the vehicles he had emailed us. Once we got there Cristian bought truck around explained the features to us in detail.  We needed to find out if our fifthwheel apparatus was interchangeable with the new truck he went above and beyond checking websites, making calls asking questions till he got us an answer.  He genuinely seemed to care in pleasing the customers.  He was not pushy like some salesman can be and that made the experience unstressful. Before we drove off the lot in our new truck he told us to call or text him if we had any questions on how certain features operated since he knew everything he had showed us was alot to remember, he said we could go back in and he would go over it again with us.  I have never experienced a car salesman being so helpful especially since we had already purchased the truck.

238,"September 07, 2018","I have been living in Texas for 12 years,we have bought 6 used cars so far in Texas . This is the first time that I post a review for purchasing experience as I feel the strong desire to share the good experience in the purchasing process and also recommend this dealer to everybody who is in the market for cars . 

I was searching for Lucerne and I saw Gunn Chevy posted a one -- I love the color and it is 09 Cxl but only has 31560 miles -- this is exactly the car I wanted-- so I made a call to see if that car was available to test drive . God bless me that Christian Figueroa was th sales rep who answered phone -- eversince then , he always responded to my text , call and emails . He suggested me to put this car on hold if I truly want to be the first one to test drive it -- I agreed to it as I was busy for work -- then after I provided my credit card -- this car was taken off from the website inventory -- Christian continues to send me pictures I wanted , answered the questions that I and my husband had . So finally I came to test drive , everything as described -- also this is the first time I could see an internal work order before test drive -- there is a list of the work they have done -- change oil and filter , engine air filter , detail , also Resurface the brake rotor-- remember this car only has 31560 miles ! Gunn is really a responsible dealer as they put the safety of customers in first spot ! I recently wrecked my 08 Buick Lucerne milage 56700 due to brake dysfunction -- Lucerne is heavier than most of the sedan and it has better built quality , so brakes are easier to worn out than light sedan naturally . Also they are fine to let you use your credit cards for the whole price as long as your credit score looks fine to them . This is the first time I saw a dealer to be so sweet too -- as if the customer prepare ahead of time , they can easily to get bonus offer 300-600 or even 800 depends on which new card you get . Surely as their website said they provide 3000mile/3 months warranty for qualified used cars -- which make any ladies who is fine to buy car by themselves peace of mind to shop in Gunn . 
After I arranged be dropped off by my coworker , then I got the car ! Second day that I found the B U I C K the logo K is missing -- then I called Christian in panic , asked him to take care of it -- he texted me back in 20 minutes telling me the part will be there for me in the next 5 days -- so he set up the service appointment for me -- also I mentioned my total loss of 08 Lucerne and also rear ended by another truck in my 05 odyssey . Yes ! I had 2 accident in 2 weeks in 8/18! So  I have to pay 2 deductible -- hopefully I would get the 2nd deductible back once everything settled in a few months as the 2nd one was not my fault .  For the sympathy for my loss and my trip time back and forth , Christian got approval for some maintenance needed for my 09 Lucerne which greatly make me and husband feel better ! My husband - even without personally interaction with any staff with Gunn , he is totally convinced by me that Gunn is the way to go in the future as long as they have the car we want. 
I am an Asian , lot of Asian ladies are not so good with cars -- but I bought the car I like from Gunn with confidence -- I saw another 06 Lucerne came right after my 09 Lucerne in 3 days and it was gone from their website just in a week too ! Their cars go so fast ! Because their service is so good and so honest ! 
I cannot say enough thank you word to Gunn and God bless America ! Hope everybody who read this can have good experience too in purchasing cars! ",5.0

The week before last we took our 2017 Chevrolet Silverado in for some bumper-to-bumper warranty repairs. As done previously, we requested that Kristofer Cole (Gunn’s Service Tech) make the requested repairs. Nothing against the other Gunn Service Technicians, but that young man can do it all and get your vehicle back to you within a timely manner as well. Would be quite a surprised if he ever could make a mistake when it comes to working on a vehicle. Overall, Kris has his ducks in a row and knows exactly what he’s doing and has proved it time and time again. As for Gunn’s Service Writer Dustin, he was extremely helpful, understanding and willing to do what it took to make us satisfied. Gunn Chevrolet has a great line up of Service Tech’s and Writers.

271,"July 01, 2018","My wife and I are very busy professionals who hold-on to our vehicles for extended periods of time, we have no margin in our lives with 3 active kids to research a major purchase, such as a vehicle.   We were  looking for help researching various Chevy Truck options, comparing costs - like the Costco program I was initially working with, and getting a deal done quickly and efficiently.

I never imagined you would rival the Costco program price and auto-buyer program, and you did that and more.

Ryan Doughty was awesome throughout our experience with Gunn.  He was hard working, quick to respond to questions, made the process efficient, and as painless as possible.  We will refer customers to him whenever the opportunity presents.

272,"July 01, 2018","My family has been purchasing from Gunn for many years which is why I chose to do the same. However, I haven’t had the best experience. No one called when my plates were in. I noticed the date on paper plates and I had one day to get my plates before expiration. I text my sales rep and he said he’d check and call me. Never did. So I text again, the day of expiration and they were in but he forgot to call me. I went to pick up when I was promised my sales rep would deliver to me. However, that wasn’t the issue. The issue was they never called to tell me my plates had arrived. My headlights needed to be buffed and because the service department was closed the day of purchased they were supposed to be done when I picked up the plates. Didn’t happen. Then I was promised mats for the vehicle and went two times and they still didn’t have them. This weekend I went for my first oil change and asked about my lights. Needed approval. Which I got. But sales rep avoided me. Then, I get home and the cap to my Buick Enclave rim is missing. Service center closed at 5 and I will not know anything until Monday, July 2! This morning I get In my vehicle to go do my Sunday errands and my vehicle is not driveable because as I accelerate and press on my brake my wheel is shaking uncotrollably so now I’m having to wait a car shop to see what is loose. Service also rotated the tires which is why my cap is missing and obviously left something loose. I’m so upset beyond belief because this is VERY dangerous, wasting another day with a car I recently purchased and I have my two year old daughter with me. This has been a horrible experience. I mean horrible. False promises. And poor work in the service center. ",2.4

They were relentless and tenacious in their efforts and found the vehicle I wanted when other dealers couldn’t or wouldn’t. Sergio was the most meticulous and detail focused sales professional I ever encountered ensuring that everything went smoothly. Laz was able to get me answers to questions within minutes where other dealers didn’t even respond.

Well I NEVER felt this way with Ryan Doughty at Gunn Chevrolet.  My first experience with Ryan was about a year ago.  He was a ""newbie"" at the dealership, about 2 months, but was very knowledgeable about what they had on the lot.  We ended up purchasing a Silverado.
This past week we called Ryan and told him we were looking for a used car.  When we got there he had a list in hand of the cars in our price/payment range.  After looking for a few minutes my husband started looking at a few newer car and asked Ryan about them.  Ryan changed gears right along with us and did a lot of work doing price comparisons and showing us deals on rebates on many different vehicles.  Needless to say another smooth transaction on the purchase of our 2018 Malibu with zero percent financing.

He was able to work with me over a couple of busy days and worked through most requests.  A few of the areas that I felt could have been worked out better, the vehicle's steering wheel was not centered and even though I asked for an alignment it was still delivered with a tilted steering wheel.  I did see the vehicle on the alignment rack with a cup of coffee inside and the mechanics joking and smoking on the opposite side of the shop. Ended up being an easy fix that should be accomplished on any alignment.  The owners manual was missing an there was a verbal promise to get one, but after looking in the dealership for one the work ended.  And lastly, even though it was a used vehicle it was missing the jack and tire changing tools, to include the special lug nut socket.

He showed us different options and came with a very attractive deal that immediately caught our attention.

He was very supportive all the time and always looking to facilitate the process and make us feel comfortable with it.

In summary, we had the most wonderful experience buying our new car.  

Thanks a lot Alfonso for really taking care of us as clients, but more important, as people.",5.0

He provided me with a price estimate by phone and I scheduled a time to visit the dealership the next day. He was off that day, but Louis Rivas filled in and made the experience easy and smooth. He reinforced much of what I had discussed with Alex and we settled on a vehicle. I like that the sales people work on salary rather than commission, which makes them more service-minded and team-oriented rather than trying to compete for the next sale. I returned the following day to finalize the paperwork and Alex walked me through all the features, etc. and Roger Barrera helped us with the financing. Overall it was a great experience working with Alex and Louis and I'm pleased with my vehicle.

The only downside to the experience was while in the waiting area two of the employees were involved in a heated argument with each other, with one of them talking down to the other in a demeaning way, but neither seemed aware of the customers in the area or seemed to even care.

429,"October 31, 2017","Buying a car/truck is never fun, but my experience with Gunn Chevrolet changed that. I purchase a truck every 10 years or so as I use it for my ranch and not my primary vehicle.  So when I wanted to update my truck, as the new ones have USB ports, etc. I wanted to make sure the truck had everything I wanted as it will be with me for several years. Luck would have it, the truck I want was not available. Trey, the sales person suggested, why don't we order one.  I never ordered a vehicle before as I always purchased one on the lot or one near by.  Trey sat with me at the computer and proceeded to order my 2018 2500 HD Silverado truck. Why not put everything I wanted and Trey would help me a lot with the options as some were not clear, but he knew what I wanted and we order it. The truck came in a month earlier than expected and worth the time and effort to order it.  A very very nice ride which may turn out to be my primary vehicle now.  Thanks Trey and Gunn!",5.0
430,"October 24, 2017","After 20 years of marriage, my wife and I had never entered a car dealership to purchase a new vehicle.  After hearing countless horror stories, I was determined to never grace the door of any dealership.  But, had I known about Gunn Chevrolet 20 years ago, who knows how many new vehicles we would have purchased!
Our sales professional, Chris Baker, was AMAZING!  Our vehicle had been at a garage in desperate need of repair.  We were informed that we needed a new engine to resolve our issues.  It was at that time we decided to purchase a new vehicle.
Chris drove from Selma to the northwest side of Bexar county.  There, he showed us some of the features offered on the vehicle we had found online.  We drove back to the dealership.  Once there, we saw a team of experts go to work.  Chris was able to have the vehicle sent to the shop and have the windows tinted while we were speaking with Rob Couser, the finance manager at Gunn Chevrolet.
Rob took the time to go over EVERY detail of our transaction.  He was clear and precise, making sure that all of our questions were answered in full.  Rob made sure that we were comfortable with the price and assured us that Gunn Chevrolet would be there if we ever needed them.
Shortly after we concluded our meeting with Rob, we left the dealership with the vehicle we wanted.  My wife and I are extremely happy with our new vehicle.  The entire experience was overall much easier and as stress-free as anyone could ever hope for.  After this car-buying experience, I know where we will be purchasing ALL of our future vehicles!",5.0

When my Wife and I arrived at the dealership, we were immediately greeted by Ben Camarero.  Mr. Camarero was very responsive and he quickly found the car that I was looking for.  We did a test drive and he answered all of our questions.  I have bought both new and used cars in the past, but I can honestly say that this was the easiest and smoothest process I had ever experienced.  One of the best aspects of this purchase was the no pressure sales and no haggling.  The price was on par with what the car was worth and the service that Mr. Camarero provided just made the experience all the better.  This was a difficult time and we are grateful for your assistance and service.

Getting different response(s) was ok. I call gunn cuz I'd had my 2014 Silverado serviced there as usual
and like the friendship quite good I may say. So calling late one evening I had a sale person jonathan that really seem be have me in his best interest! So I set up a appt. but he had said that he would be in a GM class and that jeff would b here to help me. I'd talked to other dealership and was planning to make my rounds to see and look at the different deals. My first stop was gunn and was greed right away by jeff. He show me the truck and explained every thing about the new 2017 was better. Then
went back to the table and looked at pricing and no pressure to buy right then. I left to other dealerships where I could see the different. Jonathon was always calling to see if everything went right. So I decide that gunn was my dealership that treated me a lot better. So Jonathon was with me all the way to see that I was treated right. The only thing that I was disappointed was the waiting but that's everywhere I assume? And oh lets not leave out the F & I gentleman that showed me how I could get the best financing that I wanted.

Even after I left the dealership he aided me with a number of situations.  I was a victim of Hurricane Harvey in Houston.  I was in San Antonio to buy a new vehicle in a hurry.  The local Dodge Dealership in San Antonio told me that they didn't have trucks for under 36000 at their dealership.  My wife and I promptly left.  I went to Ford next and was met with a much better experience but they couldn't get us a vehicle at the price we were hoping to spend.  I stopped at Gunn and Cam greated us warmly and found us a truck with everthing we had hoped for.  We got the deal done and he even helped me locate gas when the whole city was out!  Since I do not live in San Antonio Cam has been helpful in even making sure my trucks license plates went to the correct address since my house was destroyed in the hurricane.  I'm 36 years old and this was my first new vehicle i've ever owned and it came at a time when I was very vunerable after losing everything I owned just a few days prior.

453,"September 20, 2017","I started me journey for a new truck over a year ago. I made the decision to order and buy a 2018 Silverado. I met with Chris Baker in May of 2017 and told him what I wanted to do and what I was looking for. We set down and did a build to see where I would be price wise and what I could get with various packages.  On July 14th I went in we put together several builds to see which one met my needs the best. Once decided, the order went in. I picked up my new truck on 9/11/17. This date is significant in several ways. First, it is the anniversary of a sad day in history for the US. But it is significant to me because 16 years ago, right after 911, I purchased my 2002 Chevy 1500 HD. It was very ironic that I picked this one up on that date.

daniel was very informed about all chevy products and prices. he also found every incentive available to us and applied discounts to price.
we were very pleased and feel as though we got the best price possible. 
we had shopped ay other dealers but did not feel the best price was given at other dealership.
daniel helped us make our selection and made the process not only easy but pleasant.
we found that since we asked for another sales person their policy was to split the commission between the two sales persons. we would have never known by the way we were treated and daniel acted during our visit. 
we purchased a great truck at a great price.

492,"April 18, 2017","To whom it may concern,
My salesman was Fred Sanchez and he is the only reason why I purchased from Gunn Chevrolet.  First off, I want to state that I drove over 50 miles and passed at least 6 Chevrolet dealers.  I traveled that distance to see one specific vehicle.  The vehicle listed, stated it had 46 miles.  Upon arriving at the dealership and being shown the vehicle, I immediately discovered it had 3043 miles.  I was told by Fred that the vehicle was a demo and the listing may not be up to date.  I expressed my displeasure to Fred about the blatant FALSE ADVERTISEMENT that Gunn was performing.  Fred understood how disappointed I was and did his very best to get me a similar vehicle for a similar price.  After signing some papers with Fred, I am greeted by Richard Barrera from finance.  I spoke with Richard for less than minutes and he told me they will let me take the vehicle home, but to come back on Tuesday to do the contract.  Before leaving Richard's office, he advised me he would have no problem beating my current interest rate that I had with my trade in of 1.99%. The day before I was scheduled to sign the contract, my wife spoke to Richard about adding her name to the title.  At this point, he advised us of no issues and stated everything will be ready when we come in.  I showed up the next day at 2:50 pm to sign the contract. After checking in with the receptionist, I proceed to Richard's office.  I greeted Richard in his office as he ate a bag of pretzels, and he told me to get with Fred for the contract.  Fred was apparently on his lunch break, but showed up in less than 5 minutes.  Fred immediately told me Richard had some emergency and would not be assisting with the contract.  Myself and Fred waited for 1 hour while another finance officer got the contract ready.  I was finally greeted by Danny with finance, who informs me that my APR would be over 3%.  I am quite surprised by the interest rate since I have EXCELLENT credit.  I explain to Danny what Richard said, and he did his best to lower the rate.  Although I am not satisfied with rate I got and wlll be looking into refinancing, Danny tried to help.  In closing, if Richard had any inclination that my APR would be higher than he stated, he should have proactively informed me.  For me to wait 1 hour for a contract that was apparently ready, and then be blindsided by a higher APR, is unacceptable.  I hope the issues I have defined in this feedback can be addressed.  I hope no one else has to endure the level of disappointment I did.  You may want to give Fred Sanchez a raise for saving you from losing me as a customer.  

Thanks for listening,

He found appropriate inventory for us to help narrow our decision, and found answers to our questions about the particulars of the vehicle we had in mind. He also offered us water and made sure we were comfortable.
Once we made our selection, Ron quickly worked through the administrative tasks that are a required part of a vehicle purchase. He even found an extra discount for us, of which we were not previously aware. Ron has made himself available to help us with any questions we might have as we learn our new vehicle.

I could not have  used the brakes that much to have them so worn down I have not taken it out of town or driven it that much just to and from work  and the person inspecting it told me that it probley needed an oil change when I asked if he checked he said he didn't need to look that's why those lights usually come on ,so again tell me why I paid 59,95 I am very disappointed in this company !!!

532,"June 05, 2012","In February, my aunt and mother took me to this particular dealer because my aunt had a wonderful car purchase experience a few years previously.  Knowing my budget, I really wanted a used vehicle for myself and my children that would be fairly easy for me to pay off. After meeting the salesman, Lazaro Vasquez, I saw a Chrysler Town and Country minivan that I thought was perfect. After dealing with finance and determining that many banks did not want to accept the mileage for financing, Lazaro searched for another minivan and found a Dodge Grand Caravan at their Gunn Honda location that offered the same features.  Noticing that the led lights on the driver's sideview mirror was damaged, the salesman promised to have the issued remedied.  The day after bringing the vehicle home, I had issues with the cooling fan sensor and returned the vehicle to the dealership. Due to the repair of the cooling fan and waiting for the part for the mirror the dealership kept my vehicle for over a week while I used a loaner vehicle.  At the time that I received my vehicle back, the mirror had not been fixed and I was told that the necessary components were out of stock and would be ordered.  Then, I was promised a full tank of gas and a car wash (which I have yet to receive).  At the beginning of May when determining my options for another malfunction, I inquired about the mirror repair by phone calls and email but, never receive a response  with an exception of let me check and I'll call you right back from the manager Don Peterman. 2-3  weeks later, I receive a call from Mr. Vasquez saying that they had been trying to reach me and left messages (which is bs since I listen to and save all messages).  Nevertheless, I took the vehicle back at the end of the week to have the mirror repaired, waited an hour with my son, and left only to find out that the wrong mirror was repair, if I am to believe that anything was done at all.  If this isn't irritating enough, their receptionist doesn't know how to put people on hold before talking about them to the salespersons who may or may not chose to ignore your call because they already been warned by the receptionist who viewed caller I.D.  I am so sick of this dealership and the fluff and b.s. and am nearly out of patience and grace.  I am trying so hard to be polite because once my mirror is fixed, we are done and in the future will go somewhere else while making sure to send my referrals elsewhere.  At this point, I can honestly say that I was treated more respectfully by smaller dealers like JD Byrider. ",2.8

545,"August 14, 2011","Never has car buying been so stream-lined and pain free. I really appreciate the time and effort that the Gunn Chevrolet folks committed themselves to. My first encounter with Gunn was using the car-shopping tool on their website. I had a question about one of the vehicles and a Mr Robert Ervin responded immediately to an email query that I submitted. We set an appointment for noon on the following Saturday to sit down and look at the car that I was interested in. 

Saturday, I arrived for my appointment with Mr. Ervin, but unfortunately he was helping another customer. I was greeted at the door by an assistant, and he took me to the help counter and Mr. Ervin immediately reassigned me to another representative, Mr. Howard Yoakum, so I didn't have to wait. I didn't have to ask or anything. Everyone was all smiles, and very professional. 

The people at Gunn Chevrolet never lied to me or tried to add anything I didn't need to the car to make a sale. The car was just what they said it was. The representative even went over little things that other customers had problems with that particular model of car and what to look out for. The financier told me that as soon as the car is driven off the lot, its value will depreciate by X amount of dollars. That is what a customer wants to hear. We like honesty. My trade-in was appraised very quickly and they gave me a fair deal on the trade, more than I had hoped to gain. Gunn Chevrolet was every bit as honest as I had hoped and more. If I ever need to buy another car, I will definitely go to Gunn again.

Despite being a place for outdoor vehicles the gather and the heavy traffic of people within, the interior of Gunn Chevrolet was immaculate. They take very good care of their work place. I was very surprised at how clean and neat everything was. 

The wait from start to finish was from 11:37am to 3:41pm. About 4 hours from start to finish. And that was me going in there saying ""I want THAT car!"" from the get-go. Now that may seem like a long time to some, but given the heavy traffic going through that place on a Saturday, I would not have complained. Everyone was working so very hard and I don't think it would be fair to judge them based on a wait time. The long wait was accompanied by apologies for the wait and polite offers of bottled water and directions to the public restrooms. (Which were also very clean)
 
All in all, I think Gunn has exactly what a customer wants. You may not find the car you are looking for, but you will walk out of that place saying ""Dang! Those people are an inspiration!""

I hate writing reviews - but in all honesty, they deserve the credit.

550,"June 21, 2011","Upon arriving at Gunn, Mr. Arriaga was very helpful.  From the beginning, he was interested in helping my husband and myself locate the type of vehicle we were looking for.  He was very concerned with our needs not just a vehicle.  Mr. Arriaga was very pleasant to work with.  He made our visit to Gunn very comfortable.  My husband and I are the type to keep our vehicles for ten plus years, so hopefully Moises will still be there, when we are ready for the next one. Everyone at Gunn were very friendly from Richard Roe the manager to Tundra in the finance department.   ",5.0
