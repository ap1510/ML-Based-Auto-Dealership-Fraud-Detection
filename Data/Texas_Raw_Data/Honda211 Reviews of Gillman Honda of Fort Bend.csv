1,"June 10, 2020","Loved my experience here ! Bought a certified pre-owned Honda HR-V. Initially there were some issues with the price of the car, but the General Manager Mr. Teno Fontenot was nice enough to intervene and everything happened very smoothly onwards from there. I must appreciate the client advisor Mr. Barry Alster for handling things in a very nice, professional, courteous and respectful manner. Would positively recommend others. I would just request/suggest the dealership to display the overall/total price of the cars (including all charges) on the advertisements, which might help the potential buyers avoid possible confusions.",5.0
2,"May 31, 2020","Called to negotiate a vehicle and the manager stated a higher price of $800.00,  than what they have it on their website and CarFax. The vehicle was priced at 11,791, the manager wanted 12,500. Spoke to Robyn Helton attempting to negotiate the price and pay cash, she refused to tell the manager what my highest cash price was to purchase the vehicle. She is a useful as a hemorrhoid. Acted as I was wasting her time in the few minutes I talked to her over the phone.  If she was unwilling to help over the phone, I can just imagine the service I would get in person.  Do your homework if you decide to go Gillman Honda and purchase a vehicle, cause they'll give you a higher price than what's online.",1.0
3,"April 15, 2020","Purchase experience went smooth, 4-4-20 I give credit to “Kutaiba” for the sales experience. I purchased a 2020 Honda Civic Si. I have had to come back three times after the purchase from the dealership. 4-8-20The first time was because I windows were not tinted correctly. By me saying not correctly I mean, the windows were not cleaned correctly when the tint was installed, also the cutting on the tint was not clean cut. You could also see that the roll of tint was banged up by the crinkles shown on the tint once it was installed on my car. Needless to say, the tint was “re done” but you can still see the crinkles from the tint and the rear window was still done incorrectly. When I picked up the vehicle from the tint replacement, my car was damaged and needed paint because the damage went all the way through the paint. At this point I’m giving the dealership a chance to prove themselves once again. I showed up today 4-13-20, spoke directly with GM Teno and he himself can tell you the job was done horribly. There was a puddle of over spray in the rear bumper, the buffing job had left swirl marks all over the passenger side, there was more over spray on the passenger door and from then I realized no one bothered to look over this job and make sure all of my issues were taken care of and I wouldn’t have to come back again, knowing this was my fourth time returning. I left the car to attempt once again to get another issue corrected. At this point if the vehicle is not done correctly I will leave the vehicle with the dealership, assure I get my down payment returned and continue my search somewhere else. Thank you Honda for the opportunity but I will not be held responsible to drive out with a fake smile on my face knowing I paid for a “new” vehicle that was spotless and now expected to leave with a damaged vehicle that has a sloppy paint job, you expect to come to the dealership and assume you get top notch service and not a mediocre “deal with it” attitude.",1.0

6,"December 04, 2019","Frank Canales, my Service Advisor did me a big favor.  I was having battery trouble, but the auto parts store I bought it from tested their battery and said it was good.  I questioned their equipment, and they said if someone else gave me any document showing battery was bad, they would replace it.  I took my  Honda CRV to Gilman Fort Bend as I always do, and I explained to Frank Canales what was happening.  He said he would run an electronic diagnostic for free. I told him if it was the battery, I would be using my warranty at the auto parts store, and not Gillman.  Frank said ""not to worry"" I was a good Gilman customer and he was happy to help me out.  Guess what:  the battery was bad!.  I took Franks report to the auto store and got my new battery under warranty.  Thumbs up Frank..  H. Thomas ",5.0

8,"September 03, 2019","I purchased a new 2016 Honda Pilot from Gillman Honda of Fort Bend.  Since I purchased it, I have had all service done at this location.  Frank Canales is my service representative.  I always enjoy working with Frank.  He has been very helpful in getting the maintenance done in a timely manner and is always  very open and up front with the cost of the repairs.   Kudos to Frank.",4.8
9,"September 03, 2019","Management decided to sabotage a disabled woman with a fixed income. Actually with no income waiting on disability to be approved through social security. I went in and bought my car cash off the lot, this was right after I was bought out of the house through my divorce. I had nothing to drive. A sweet, professional young man was working  for this dealership at the time and I we went to him and bought a Honda Accord 2009. Looked great drove great I thought it was awesome first day I have a blowout. And then a day later the windshield mirror fell off of the windshield. I cannot get ahold of the manager of a assistant manager or anybody to approve them to put a new windshield mirror up. They sold me a warranty that quote-unquote I was getting family/employee discount through my the dealership approved by manager.. And it covered bumper to bumper warranty. Of course not the maintenance that was on me. But every time I have taken my vehicle there to be serviced they want to charge $140 diagnostic fee! Stupid and ridiculous. I'm handicapped I received a very small amount of money per month that is why I bought the car cash and wouldn't have to worry about payments. Every time I take it in that warranty doesn't cover it. I cannot get a manager or any and I need to return my call I spent almost $2,000 on that so I was told,"" bumper to bumper warranty."" There's always an excuse for these people not to answer me. xxxx they even got my name on the title wrong, can't get anyone to answer to that either. Unfortunately and probably obviously my dalesman has quit since then. For a good reason I'm sure! but I have only had my car for a year exactly and it has so many problems and it's just ridiculous! I will never buy a car from gillman Honda fort Bend ever again! Like I said they are taking advantage of good people especially elderly disabled people I STILL Don't have a drunken rearbeiw mirror! Several things were to be fixed on what they call a ""WE OWR' and since dalesman is gone.  Bounced around to do many people. And get NOWHERE?  I was robbed by fort bend gillman Honda in broad daylight!  Shame shame Sheme

I was even told my oil changes were free and detailing, unlimited. Free.  But nope. Not that either",1.4
10,"May 09, 2019",I have purchased numerous new vehicles from other dealerships and have never been mislead as horribly as I was today. I was given a quote in writing and verified by text from the salesman only to be told that the price had changed an hour later.  Then I try to speak to the General Manager and he is conveniently at lunch then with customer meetings all afternoon when I tried calling back. People like these are the epitome of slimy car salesmen. Maybe tomorrow the GM will have time to take my call but definitely not going to hold my breathe. Looks like I am buying from one of the reputable dealerships that warned me about this type of shadiness.,1.0
11,"March 28, 2019","I went to originally go look at civic and test drive, and decided to go forward with the purchase since they said they would match my trade, I go into finance and we had a different number for the vehicle and the trade that was agreed on, plus they added some extra things that I didn’t ask for. Do not buy from this place, and do not work with Keith, or Charles.",1.4

14,"January 10, 2019","I was there to buy a used SUV that they had still posted at their website, I drove 45 min. To go there and to realize that according to them they JUST SOLD IT (sure) well I started looking at the other cars they have on the lot and I found one that was priced at $2500 and I asked them for the key to drive it ... after 30 min waiting, they told me SOME EMPLOYEE WAS PLAYING with that truck and posted that price with the dealer window stickers and everything, so I asked if I could speak with the manager.. ohh lord the meanest, irrespectful person in there he made me wait there another 20 min to say “what do you want me to do “ come on , and insinuate that if I knew how much those car cost and said yeah you were here to buy a cheap car !!!! So mad . Oh I have pictures that proves everything never buy here SCAMMERS, LIERS",1.0
15,"November 06, 2018","I was dealing with dealer for about a week and tried to negotiate the price; knowing that it's already overpriced.  I checked the CarFax and any information out there pertaining to a 2012 GMC Terrain.   When I asked about him lowering the price, I didn't hear back from this salesman for days.  I happen to just follow up with him and all of a sudden there is supposedly something wrong with the transmission.  None of this was stated when we first started communicating.  So I asked, if there's something wrong with the transmission, why is it still listed on AutoTrader and why none of that information is available.  He continued with the dishonesty and if this was a know issue from the beginning of our communication.  In all reality, he didn't want to sell me the vehicle because I asked for a lower price.  This place I do not recommend to anyone and will not be dealing with them.",1.0
16,"October 23, 2018",I would not recommend them to anyone searching for a vehicle. I was sold a vehicle with a non-working sunroof and was told it was a fuse and it would be fine so I bought the fuses and the sunroof still did not work come to find out it was both motors that were out and not to mention that when it rains it leaks through the light fixtures above and on the floors. When I spoke to manager was no help either.,1.8

19,"August 17, 2018","I am actively shopping for a 2018 Honda Accord for my daughter in college.  We didn't want or need a new car, but the 2018 base Accord LX has the collision mitigation system and other safety features that we want for our daughter.  We found 4 vehicles through an internet search that met our needs and budget, all of them at Gillman Honda Fort Bend.  All four vehicles were 2018 Accord LX models with between 2,700 and 4,000 miles.  I confirmed that the vehicles were also included in the pre-owned inventory on the dealer's own web site.

I live about 30 minutes away from this dealership, so I called to confirm that the vehicles were available before driving there.  The sales rep said he would confirm and call back, but I actually arrived before he returned my call.  It was 7 pm when I arrived and the dealership closes at 9 pm.  When I got there, I was first told that all of the advertised vehicles had been sold.  The sales rep then tried to sell me an 2017 EX model for thousands more.  This was their first attempt at a bait and switch.  I quickly explained that the 2017 did not have the safety features I wanted, and I asked him to verify that there were no Certified/Used 2018 vehicles in inventory.  It seemed odd that all would be sold, especially since one of the advertised vehicles did not even include a picture on the website.  Instead, the site said the picture was coming soon, seemingly indicating that the vehicle was brand new to their inventory.  

The sales rep then checked with his manager and returned with the surprising news that they indeed had three of the used 2018 Accords at the advertised price, but all of them were in the Service department being readied for sale.  He said he couldn't show me the vehicles because the Service department was already closed, but he offered to make an appointment the next day when I could see them and complete the purchase if I was interested.  He gave me the three colors of the vehicles and said he would reserve my color of choice until our appointment the next day at 10 am.  I reserved the silver vehicle, and all was good.

The next morning, my daughter and I made the drive down to the dealership again, arriving at exactly 10 am.  As soon as we walked in, the salesman stated that there had been a mistake in the way they coded the vehicles into their inventory system and in fact all three of the vehicles had already been sold.  However, he assured me that they would 'make it right' and sell me a new Accord LX at the same price since it was their error.  I didn’t come in for a new car, nor was I in the market for a new car, but the manager even went so far to state that they would basically take a loss on a new car to correct their mistake.   

Unfortunately, this was just another lie and another attempt at a bait and switch.  As you might guess, the price for the new car was thousands more than the advertised price that brought me to the store on two separate trips.  During this 'negotiation', there were various attempts by the sales rep and the New Car Sales Manager to explain away the difference in price, including a higher MSRP as well as two additional and separate charges, one for approximately $1,500 for a protection package and another charge for something else in the range of $950 for which I don't recall the excuse.  

During the discussion, it also came out that their advertised price of $20,990 for the slightly used vehicles did not include a hidden charge of $1,000 that called the Certified charge.  This upcharge to the phantom used cars was never discussed prior to that point, nor was it included as a footnote to the advertised prices on the internet.  

Basically, everyone I dealt with at this dealership either attempted to deceive me or outright lied to me.  The only possible alternative to the purposeful deception is that, from top to bottom, an entire Honda dealership is staffed with people too stupid to perform even the most basic tasks necessary to operate an ethical business.  I have had my fair share of shady sales people in more than 30 years of buying cars, but this is the first time I have encountered such purposeful deception.  It’s a shame that a fine product like Honda automobiles is represented by a dealer like Gillman Honda of Fort Bend.

20,"August 10, 2018","I was there for my Honda Odyssey 60,000 miles service - Van would not start next day.  Took it back to be told battery issue and I also noticed that they had not rotated my tires.  All these were listed items in the 60,000 miles service package.  So if these two which were clearly visible were ""NOT"" done...makes you wonder if any of the other listed items were done at all.  Also this is not the first time where they did not rotate the tires for me...a year ago I had the same complaint and I reminded them again this time about it.......and yet they did not care to address it! Really!! 
So unless you are savvy enough to go over each and every item in the list and have enough time to make sure they were all addressed -stay away from their service department!!",1.4

24,"May 20, 2018","On 9/27/17, my dad and I went to go look at a 13 BMW they had. After test driving it, I decided that I wanted it. LUIS N. stated that the car would be ready later that same day. My dad decided to sign the paperwork so that I could easily get the car on my own since he works out of town. I put a down payment of $1500.Luis then stated that for the car to be ready, they had to service it and added an additional $990 to the loan. The service would include an 150 point inspection, oil change, detail, and they would wax the car. Upon completing the paperwork, Luis told us that the car would not be ready until the next day and gave me a rental. The next day, Thurs, Luis said that it will be ready until Fri. On Fri, Luis had not called at all. On Sat, my dad called Luis and he said that it would be ready on Mon at 11a. On Mon, at 12p, the car was not ready! By that time, I had decided that I had enough & it was best to take my business somewhere else. I told Luis that I would return the rental on Tuesday and I wanted them to refund me my down payment and send the bank the appropriate paperwork. When I was on my way to return the rental Tues, Luis called me and told me that they would give me $315 for my first car note so that I could take the car. When I got there to see if they actually serviced it, my dad had noticed that the car was in the SAME CONDITION that we had left it. I told his boss BEN who was taking care of us that I DID NOT want the car because why pay so much money for something or a service you're not getting? BEN GOT VERY NASTY with my dad and RAISED HIS VOICE several times. We decided to leave. On Wed, I tried calling to speak to the manager ALDO who is also very rude. I probably called the dealership 10 different times for them to send the paperwork to the bank and they were reluctant. I got so desperate I even called the owner C. Gillman who to this day, has not returned any of my calls. However, he had the time to tell them to offer me a $200 gift card for me to take the car. I declined. Days later, my dad and I made one final trip to the dealership to talk to MARCO C. because he said that the manager was willing to refund the $990 WE PAID for services they DID NOT PROVIDE. When we got there, he said that the manager had changed his mind and the most they could give us was the $315. We said no, we don’t want the car. But, in order for him to start the refund process he needed the approval from Ben. Ben said that I would not be able to get my down payment of $1500 at all. To remind you, I had NOT TAKEN the car off of the lot. The BMW had been in THEIR POSSESSION since we went to look at it a week before and I test drove it & we did the paperwork. Yet they DID NOT want to refund me my hard earned money or send the bank the draft so that My dad can get another loan. Because of all of the trouble they were giving us, we decided to just take the car. When I looked at the odometer it had 69k, but yet when WE FIRST PURCHASED the car, it had about 67k. They had the car for weeks. WHO COULD HAVE BEEN DRIVING IT PUTTING ALMOST 2k ON IT? I HAVE NO IDEA! FAST FOWARD to this weekend, I took the car to BMW to get an oil change. To my surprise, they said I was 8k miles overdue for one, & the reason I didn’t know was because the timer had most likely been tampered with. While servicing the car, they noticed that the oil drain was tightened way too tight & it was an OFF MARKET PART, not a BMW one, & in order to fix it it would cost me $2200. Furious, I called Honda to let them know & they said they could not do anything as far as reimbursement although they were the last ones to service the car. Even a BMW WORKER CALLED THEM to let them know & they said they sent the car off to a dealership but yet couldn’t give that information. Which means THEY DID IT & SOLD ME A MESSED UP CAR! & THEY DONT WANT TO HELP PAY FOR IT! It’s so frustrating! I would NEVER RECCOMMEND OR RETURN TO THEM! C. Gillman is SELFISH and does not care at all about his customers! He never acknowledged me. WARNING DO NOT GO THERE",1.0

I was them told to come in so we can make the deal happen. Once I arrived they changed their tone and neither one of these men even met with me they kept using the sales associate as the middle man. They expressed to me the only way I would be able leave with a vehicle is by putting down near $7,000( which was never expressed to me before) or having my payment go up by $200-$300.

31,"January 15, 2018","My sister went there in 2016 to buy a used car and they sold her a rebuilt car without telling her it was rebuilt and made it sound like it was clean.

Come today (1/15/18) she went there again (her mistake) to give them a second chance...they showed her a 2018 Honda Pilot, test drove it and made the deal but they tried selling her a 2017. The Salesperson was Jordan who did a good job and knew exactly going on, but the manager Jason was ABSOLUTELY RUDE and should not be in a retail business.

They made the deal, ran the credit and then changed on them during signup...they tried to cheat them by saying they don’t qualify for the 0.9% to which my sister was ready to pay cash.

41,"October 08, 2017","Very unprofessional staff. Welcome desk representative hardly cared why we were there. Their sales representative had given us certain price for a Honda Accord over the phone  and had confirmed that they would match the price offered by another Honda dealer -which perhaps belongs to the same group a few miles north of this dealership.

The sales person was welcoming and polite in his attitude but the manager was very curt, dismissive, unfriendly, impatient , lacking good basic customer skills and very unprofessional . He didn't want to discuss the numbers at all- as was promised by the sales rep- and in spite of our asking several times.  His attitude was "" take it or leave "" . 

The manager had no courtesy to discuss the price in spite of knowing we were returning customers ( we had bought a Honda Accord just a few months ago from the same dealership), in spite of the fact that we were assured that the numbers will be discussed in detail and in spite of knowing that we were coming from  a city 120 miles  away from Houston . He didn't even offer to show any vehicle from the available stock. 

Didn't expect this kind of unprofessional attitude from a dealer of one of the best car manufacturers in the world. 

We will never step back in this dealership.  Honda lost our business because of this manager 's bad attitude.  We bought a Hyundai from a dealer a few miles north of this dealership - where we were treated with respect and professionalism.

 3. Raise seat level for signer, so they do not have to stand to see what they're signing.
4. Consistently on all forms use same designation (i.e. Middle Name, Maiden Name, Location where vehicle will be housed, Mailing Address, etc.).
5. Have process manager look over/approve all documents before presenting to customer, to prevent employee inaccuracy in copying customer input from forms. (Don't burden customer with having to verify accuracy).

He sold us two Odysseys when our children were young and now he has sold us two Accords for those young children who are headed off to college.

52,"December 08, 2016","The vehicle sticker, sales and finance department said the Nitro package was on my car.  The Nitrogen package included nitrogen filled tires and a road hazard warranty that covered the tires and wheels in case of damage.  I was told that it is already on the car.  I did not think it was smart to pay for nitrogen when 78% of the air we breath is nitrogen.  That sounded like a scam.  However, it included the tire and wheel road hazard. 

On December 3rd at about 5:30, a bolt punctured my car tire while driving.  I called the Honda dealership about an hour before they closed requesting assistance.   They told me that they would have to find my paperwork and call me back.  They didn't call back so I called them.  They told me that I would have to deal with it on Monday because they were closed on Sunday.  I called on Monday and the person that checked my contract folder said there was nothing in it about a warranty, not even the extended warranty that is separate from the Nitro package.  I asked to speak with Crystal (sales manager) and she claimed that I got such a good deal on the car that there was not Nitro package warranty.  I told her it was on the sticker and sales contract.  She told me that there was nothing she could do for me.  I then called the main office and spoke with Stacey Gillman's assistant, Debi Adams, and she told me she was going to call Aldo Cortes, the manager at Gillman Ft. Bend.  Gillman Ft. Bend responded with an offer to try and repair the tire this one time as a courtesy.  My response is that I have a warranty and they need to honor that warranty today and in the event of any future problem as specified in the warranty.  

Gillman Honda has breached our agreement for purchase by refusing to honor it in it's entirety. They have neglected to honor our agreement and have deliberately defrauded me out of money.",1.0
53,"October 25, 2016","We went to dealership this weekend as they offer Costco discount. Once we get there, they told us they will give us trade in value for our Van for $8200, that is the price without seeing the Van. So we drove 30 min home and drive Van back, then they told us that our Honda van had recall on airbag that were never fixed, which if is fixed, they would give us $9500 for our trade in. I told them if it were air bag issue with my Honda van, I would hold off everything in my life to have it fixed as it transport my 3 little boys on a daily basis. The Sales manager Ryan (suppose to be the main guy there) told us that there is shortage of material for fixing the Air bag, some Honda van has to wait for 9 month so it is lost for them if we trade in our van as it would have sit in the back. I was very angry that how come the Honda dealership in Katy Tx where I service the van did not fix my airbag. A day later, on Monday, I called Honda dealership in Katy and spoke to Carl, he assure me there were NEVER any recall on the air bag in Honda Van, he know for sure as he is the general manager at Honda car service for many years!!! I then call this Ryan guy up, he told me that he is right, Carl is wrong, but all of sudden, he is allowing me to trade in and bring the van!!! I guess miracle do happen, this is just bunch BS!!!! I feel he is just blowing hot air up where the sun does not shine!!!! Then when I call back to speak to Ryan to purchase the van, all of sudden, he is in ""meeting all day"", could not possibly call me back!!! I used a different phone, he answered, now he is telling me he will give me $9000 for my trade in Honda van and then start to pick on my Van saying the paint is chipped. Sadly, when I drove my Van two days ago, he was fine with it after he did careful inspection of the van and was willing to give me $9500.

54,"August 09, 2016","I went to this dealership after my son contacted a salesman via the internet-Josh who informed him that he could place him in a vehicle with a payment he was comfortable with knowing the credit situation however, over 4 hours later we agreed to leave some cash so that the deal can be worked on at the urging of Ben..to as he stated ""show we were serious so they can work a deal for us"". It was agreed that if the interest rate was not at the number I informed Ben of that I would not be pursuing a purchase. Ben looked me in the eye shook my hand and stated "" if at anytime I chose not to pursue the purchase I could come into the dealership and retrieve my money"". Josh did not provide me with concrete numbers, tried to place my son in a car that he did not want, and went back on his word as well that I could come at anytime before 9...closing time to retrieve the money I left. When I get there after working all day and driving 36 miles I was told the accounting department was closed and the check could not be provided. Ben was very insulting stating this isn't a 7 Eleven we don't have the cash if I had your 300 dollars I would give it to you, I was taking a nearly 2000 dollar loss to get your son in the car versus the amount of money left. Okay well when you saw the interest rate was not in the percentage I gave you as informed on the original day why proceed? I was clear and specific on the numbers I was looking at with no exceptions. Josh was texted nearly 45 minutes before I went to retrieve my money and I was not informed until I was taking the exit that the accounts department was closed and I could not receive my money. I appreciated all the effort put in however, in no way does that minimize the condescending comments made by their supposedly ""courteous staff, to be blunt and HONEST it was Ben"". If your not a 7 Eleven why take money from me like one. Don't be disrespectful and a blatant liar for this is extremely unprofessional. Josh I will say that at least you were polite and apologetic maybe you should train Ben in customer service skills he could learn something from you. So as I was corralled  to the door by Ben I was told "" I will have Josh personally deliver your check for 300 dollars to your job by tomorrow 08/09/2016"" I will be waiting to see if Ben understands the value of honoring his word.

57,"January 02, 2016","The only reason I'm giving the dealership 2 stars instead of 1 is because I had a very pleasant experience with their internet sales rep, Debra Hernandez prior to stepping in to the actual store. I went in to the store having already done a test drive (elsewhere) and having finalized a drive out price for a Honda Odyssey EX. The whole process still took an excruciating 3 hours of signing papers, waiting for an hour, signing more papers, waiting for an hour, and then waiting for someone to give me the keys to go.

In addition, I received conflicting statements about insurance and financing. The floor manager said my current car insurance would cover the new car for the 1st 30 days while the finance sales rep was emphatic that I needed to get coverage on my new car within the 1st 72 hours. The floor manager also recommended that I pay off the car within the 1st statement so that I could take advantage of the $500 financial promotional discount without incurring much interest while the finance sales rep said that if I paid the car off before the 4th statement, I wouldn't be eligible for the $500 discount. I don't think they meant to be dishonest, I think it just reflects the lack of thorough training - those questions are common for customers to ask and all sales reps whether they're on the floor or in finance should have one consistent answer.

Finally, as I'm about to sign the papers, I notice that the drive out price was $230 higher than what had been quoted to me through my email communication with Debra. When I pointed out, the sales rep took it to their manager to be corrected. $230 is no small amount of money and could cover months of gas. I received no apology from the manager, whose fault it was. And when I asked the sales rep how the error came about, he claimed that the manager forgot to calculate in the fees related to the title. Best case scenario - the manager is doing their job poorly - the email clearly said drive out price so I don't see how the manager could have mixed that up. Worst case scenario - they were intentionally trying to deceive me by sneaking up the price on me.

While the 3 hour wait time and the conflicting statements about insurance and financing were annoyances, the attempt to $230 extra is what motivates me to make sure I post this rating.",2.6
58,"June 28, 2015","We were looking for a vehicle with a 3rd row seat and large enough 2nd row seat to hold 3 car seats.  We had narrowed our search to a Honda Pilot or Chevy Traverse.  We were recommend to go to a different Honda dealer much farther away, but they had no 2015's in inventory.  We decided to stop in to Gillman because they had some inventory.  We were sort of given the run around.  It took us over 2 hours to see a new car.  We actually loved the Pilot, but then things got really sketchy.  They quoted us the car at full MSRP, when other dealers were discounting them $5000+ due to 2016 arriving.  We told Mark we were trying to stay under a certain monthly payment, but he came back with over $200 more per month.  They refused to negotiate because we were going to look at a Traverse.  Truthfully if the price was right we might have bought on the spot.  What really bothers me is that when I got home, I played with a financial calculator based on the price of the car ( as I was told.)  My figures are over $100 per month less than what we were told.  When we left the dealership I was frustrated because we were over $16000 different on a car we loved.  In actuality we were probably $5000-$6000 different, but due to their sales practices we didn't get to negotiate.  We ended up with a Traverse because of the dealership experience, but will definitely look at a Pilot again in the future, but NEVER at another dealership owned by Gillman.  ",1.0
59,"June 22, 2015","This is regarding my bad and frustrating experience with the Honda USED Sales team during my recent interaction on June 06 2015
I had purchased a Honda CRV (used car) 2013  Model from the Gillman Honda (Rosenberg) Houston. The sales person (Karim) who had joined the team a  week before was nice and helped us in selecting the correct car.  However we did not have a positive experience with both the Sales Managers (Steven and  Jean ) during the negotiation and finalization phase. During negotiation, ‘Jean’ just like that walked out of the room rudely and we felt very insulted by his response and behavior (Be very careful with this person). It was totally shocking and weird.  Later when we stepped out without finalizing, couple of others from sales team stood outside and were apologetic and asked us to come in and helped us close  the deal and Steven (the other sales manager) was one of them but Steven’s attitude and response changed completely after we signed the deal. 
Moreover , when we were actually signing the contract with the finance team (in a separate department) , we realized that the total amount of the car was wrongly entered by one of the sales manager (and was increased by 5000$) and it took more than one hour for us to find out the differences in the monthly installments. We had to repeat the  whole contracting  process with the revised $ and we spent more than 2 hours on that. 
During the car selection process, we were clearly told that we will have two keys for the car. Things took a turn for worse once we completed all the formalities/ sign the deal  and when we came to collect the car. We were shocked when we were given just one key for the car.  Instead of helping , the Sales Manager (Steven) was very rude in his response and was showing his attitude. We almost gave up as the end to end process to buy an used car from this department took around 5 hours and we did not have any energy to respond or argue with the manager of such an attitude.
When we came out  one for the sales guy told  that he will get back to us in a couple of days on the second pair of key but we never heard back from them. Every time we call, we are told that they will get back to us. Eventually we were told that  it will be easier for us to get a new key made at my own expense that too in a rude and insulting manner by Steven.  After having spent more than $21,000 on the car, I do not think this sort of customer service/ behavior is expected from Gillman. 
We had come to Gillman because we believed that they were good at treating their customers nicely but this overall frustrating experience with Gillman Honda clearly proved that we were totally wrong and we will never come back nor we will recommend to our friends and relatives.
After this behavior and a bad experience, I will never ever recommend Gillman to anyone. Friends, there are lots of other good Honda dealers in Houston who does a better service than this i believe. When you walk out with a car, you should feel good about it but I just had the opposite feel and you please do not go through the same experience and difficulty as I had. Be careful and think twice before you visit this dealership!!!

61,"June 10, 2014","I'm extremely dissapointed with the service I received from this dealership. First, they didn't have the car with the exact features I was looking for; namely a DVD player. So, they sold me a car with a non-dealership installed unit which they assured me it was better in quality than the factory brand. 
To make a long story short, the unit broke with the very first DVD we attempted to play in it. I attempted to return the unit since I figured it was not a good omen for the future. I was told I could not return it. The best they could do was to replace it.
Their own words ""You can't change your mind because the deal has been funded""; translation: we got your money.
Also: ""You're welcomed to trade in your new van for another one"". We all know who makes money on that deal.
I had been a loyal Honda customer for quite a while now. As a result of this experience, two things will happen for sure.
1) This is the last Honda vehicle I will ever buy.
2) I will tell everyone I know who's planing to buy a Honda not to buy at this dealership.
The only reason I came to this dealership location was because it was the closest one to my home. I would have been better off driving accross town.
It's a stereotypical car salesman attitude here. Everyone is really nice and courteous when you walk in but as soon as they got your money, customer satisfaction goes out the window.

I understand the advisers are the frontline and may not fully understand the mechanical needs. The techs diagnose and repair.

I got a call Friday afternoon asking if I can leave it until Monday because they cannot duplicate the issue. I get a call Monday with a $1200 estimate to tear into the rear ac unit just to find out what's bad. I had supplied that information already and the tech wasn't sure which part needed to be replaced.

69,"August 18, 2013","Our entire experience at Gillman Honda Fort Bend has been everything but a good one. On 08/02/13 I took my family in to the dealership with an appointment at 5. We were greeted by a very unprofessional salesman David Davis who is no longer there. I figure first impressions should have been a warning sign but decided to give it a chance. Mr. Davis was very pushy and demanded that we tell him if we were just looking or buying.  I told him to show us some vehicles and if we were interested we would buy. At this point things were looking slim but the sales manager Phillip Morales came down to talk to us. He was helpful and to take the time out. Well, we ended up buying a 2013 Honda Crv. It was not at the dealership but was told if we bought it we would get it the following morning delivered. We went on with the purchase with the agreement that visors would be put on and that it would be in the driveway the next morning. That however was not the case. The following day at noon we had to call to ask where the call was only to be answered by Mr. Davis asking us if we could pick up the car. After a few minutes of talking he finally says he will be on his way. We then get a knock at the door, who was Mr. Davis. We asked when will the visors be put on and Davis answers back with “we will call” and drives off. 08/11/13 it rains and bit, cut on the wipers and one of the blades flies off. A HUGE SAFETY HAZARD. I called the following day and was told that it could be fixed. However, with job constraints was not able to take the vehicle in. I advised my mom to carpool till I could take it in for her. Friday 08/16/13 I drive up there and was told that they could install the visors and replace the wiper on Saturday. So I made an appointment for Saturday and drove back home. Saturday 08//17/13 I drive out and the service department is closed due to electrical problems. I was told I would have to come back on Monday because they could not get the computers running. I told them that the least they could do is give me a wiper blade to get by if it rains. Again I get told that computers were down and that I would not be able to get a blade till Monday. Overall I give the whole experience of dealing with Gillman Honda Fort Bend a bad rating because things could have been done more professionally like advising customers if the service department is down, listen to the concerns of the customer not just before but after the sale also. If I was asked to recommend this dealership I would not recommend it. There are better dealerships out there. ",2.6

I hired a company called From Car to Finish by Mike Rabkin to perform all the necessary negotiations on my behalf. After Carlos G, the internet manager from Gillman Honda finalized all the numbers and options with Mike, Mike said it was time I called Carlos to go over the agreement. I asked Carlos to email me the final numbers and options for the car. Carlos informed me and Mike that the car with the options we agreed on was available and he was going to retrieve the VIN. I told Carlos I would be there by the 31st to retrieve the car. One day later, I did not think it was necessary to call Carlos (BIG MISTAKE) to confirm his attendance at the dealership. On the morning that I arrived at the dealership, I asked for Carlos and instead was greeted by Carlos's manager Phillip M. Phillip said he would be helping me instead. Phillip pulled out the signed copy of the negotiation deal that Carlos had agreed with Mike on the behalf of my approval. When Phillip went over the numbers and options on the car, the total price of the car came out to be $900 dollars more than the agreed price Carlos and I had calculated and agreed on. A battle of words broke out and the general manager was called in. The GM told me that Carlos had made a mistake on the quote and they were not able to sell me the car for that agreed price. Even though Carlos had signed for the deal, the dealership refused to honor the quote. Long story short, and 7 hours later, I sat through the worst experience of my life. Not only did the dealership not honor their employees' signature, and email confirmation quotes, they did not even have the car promised car in stock. When I got there, the car Carlos had promised on the phone ONLY THE DAY BEFORE, it was ""sold."" I felt shattered and cheated. I want to let every one know how elaborate the bait and switch scam really gets. They BAITED me by promising IN WRITING with a signature, mind you, a very attractive price for a car that was sitting in their holding lot, and when I arrived ready to pay, they SWITCHED the entire deal. Bad Business, Not Trustworthy, Breech of Contract Agreement and Horrible Customer Service. Never will I step foot in the dealership again and ANYBODY who wants to buy from them should beware.

I placed $500 to ""hold"" the vehicle upon arrival until I secured the down payment from my insurance company.  The car arrived sooner than was expected, but it still arrived in June.  Carlos had assured me that the price was what he stated it would be.  When I get to the dealership, he proceeded to tell me that the price was now nearly $1k more than what he stated, due to Honda incentives having expired.

He arranaged a convenient date and time for me to bring my CR-V back to the dealershp for the window tint, which there was not time to have it done on the date of purchase since the vehicle was late in arrival.

94,"December 31, 2011","Was shopping a 2012 CRV for my mother-in-law the week they came out. Most dealerships around houston only wanted MSRP and weren't interested in negotiating or budging since this popular new model just came out or they didn't even have the color/trim that we wanted, while the pompous jack-a$$es at Honda Cars of Katy were charging $1,500 over MSRP by tacking on a bunch of useless dealer-installed options. Although we live in Katy, we drove down to Gillman Ft. Bend to make the purchase. I emailed all the dealerships in and around houston and Bill Cockrell was the first one to respond with a straight-forward price quote that was slightly less than MSRP for the exact color/trim that we wanted. We did all the negotiating via email, and I took my mother-in-law in to pay and sign the papers the same day. Pretty straightforward and they didn't try and upsell her on anything or change the price (which is a major plus in my book). Only minor gripe I have is it took longer (2 hours) than I wanted since they were pretty busy at the dealership that day, but pretty typical for taking longer than it should when buying a new car.  Thanks Bill and Gillman of Ft. Bend! Hopefully you guys earn our business again in the spring when I shop/negotiate another CRV for my sister (I'm sure I'll have more bargaining power then once the dealerships have built up their inventory some).",5.0

I thought the quote was fair, so I told him I would be in later on in the evening to look at the vehicle.  When I got it, he was with someone else, so Jason got one of his coworkers to negotiate with us and close the deal.  Jason was great, but when we started negotiating with Matt, he started at a higher price than what we were quoted at, and told us we had to negotiate down from that higher price since the vehicle we were quoted on actually had extras, like the pin stripe and tint.  We didn't appreciated the 'game' they were trying to play.  We ended up purchasing the vehicle for close to the original quoted price, however, on the sticker it said there was a trunk tray.  We took the vehicle home.  There was no truck tray in there.  Overall, good price on the vehicle.  Just wish it had the trunk tray that it was supposed to come with.

Even though he stated he was new to the dealership, he could have at least offered me some options.  When I came in to sign the paperwork and pay for the vehicle, I told him he gave me wrong information about the existing warranty on the vehicle & never told me about extended warranties or the cost.  His explanation: ""THEY gave me wrong information"".  Who the hell is ""THEY""???  No attempt to correct it or try and fix it, just the ""deal-with-it"" response.  I felt like he didn't give a rat's ass about me anymore because he finished his sale & I had delivered the check.  Had I had the extended warranty information I could have included the cost into my financing without having to pay for it out of pocket.  I am VERY upset by that.  The only way I learned of the extended warranty was by Ali Sirat, Finance Director.  He provided me the info I needed and said had he known I wanted that he could have taken care of the paperwork for me.  I asked Nick to get some scratches off the door handles for me when they washed the car- he did that. He never answered my questions about the brakes or offer to get me a price on the large floor mat for the back of the car. He told me to call parts and they could give me that information.

137,"April 20, 2011","The salesmen, their manager, and the finance manager were very professional and their sales approach was very well matched to our needs.  My wife and I believe we were very informed buyers and did not want a lot of heavy selling, over pressing of benefits and features, and game playing during the price negotiation process.

During our initial visit, Antonio and Gary were very understanding that we were concept shopping and that we were looking at several manufacturer's products.  As such, they made it clear they want to earn our business and that they believed we would find the Accord at the top of the list, once we made our comparisons.  But they did not pressure us to make an early decision.  Doing so would have turned us off and ensured we did not return.

Once we determined that the Accord was at the top of our list (features, ride, handling), the Gillman team took the time to allow us additional test driving time and to sit in a number of vehicles.

During the price negotiations, the process was short, since the price difference between the two sides was relatively small.

Financing the vehicle was very quick.  Fel was very helpful and did not try to over explain the various elements once he realized I was a CPA and want the abbreviated version of the presentation.

Both Anthony and Bill followed up the following day to thank us for our business. Bill also checked to determine if we had additional questions or needed additional help with the car and its accessories.

I only had one complaint, and that was that when I stated my specifics on what I wanted, I was told that would not be a problem.  It did, however become a problem, when they could not locate a 2011 manual transmission.  I finally conceded to settle for an automatic.  That was my choice because they did get the color I wanted and the interest rate was right, but I expected that I would not get charged the full price difference for the automatic.  I thought that since that was a big concession on my part, they would at least pick up half of the cost.  Overall, the staff was very friendly and accommodating.

When I arrived at the dealership a couple of hours later, I was greeted by friendly individuals who directed me to Jason.  Jason was organized and thorough.  He explained things to me that I didn't understand without being condescending.  As the deal progressed, he continued to be helpful.  He suggested a cargo tray since I mentioned I had dogs.  He did not try to sell me accessories that were not necessary.  

The financial person was also very helpful and informative. He explained all the forms and any terms I was not familiar with. Jason made arrangements to deliver my new CRV to me the following day (I declined his offer to let me drive the CRV home that night and let him return my mustang to me the following day.)

Once we decided, Ed provided a very competitive price for the new car. The initial offer for our trade in was too low, but Ed did whatever was necessary to get the trade in price to a number we were comfortable with.

Ed was very helpful guiding us through the entire sales process. We had arranged our own financing, but Ed asked for the opportunity to earn our finance business also. The finance manager was able to find a rate just slightly below the rate we had arranged ourselves.

Our original plan was to shop several dealers and buy at the one who offered the best price. However, Ed was able to sell us the new car at a competitive price and was able to make a fair offer for our trade in. So we bought the car from him: We felt that at best, we could only do slightly better by shopping all over the city. And Ed made us feel very comfortable, so he earned our business on the spot.

Many people say this in passing.....I truly believe Mr. Cole meant what he said.  I can't ever see owning anything but a Honda and I don't want to do business with anyone but Mr. Cole and my other friends that I have made at Gillman Honda Fort Bend.",5.0
200,"July 13, 2010","Gillman Honda at fort bend has always tended to my needs. What I mean is that for most dealership, if not all, if you want to get service done you usually have to set up an appointment. I've just been thankful that these guys have been able to work me in and have been patient as well. I work for a hospital and I know what is needed in dealing with customer service. In that note, I want to recognize Jason Gutierrez in all the help he has contributed. When ordering parts through Honda, wheter in stock or not, Jason always kept me in the up and up. If the part needed some research he got it taken care of. He notified me when he ordered the part, how long it would take, and when it made it to the shop. So once again, thanks Jason, and all the team at Gillman Honda, for all your help.

201,"July 12, 2010","I had a wonderful experience at Gillman Honda Fort Bend. I bought at 2010 CRV on Saturday. Hazel was the most knowledgable and friendly salesperson I have dealt with in years. She even programmed my favorite radio stations for me! Ali, the finance guy was great,too. No pressure, only facts. The cars speak for themselves--and sell themselves. If you are in the market for a new/used car, it's worth the extra twenty minute drive out 59 south for the relaxed atmosphere and friendliness. I cannot recommend this place highly enough. Also met Chris Gillman, who is such a nice guy! ",5.0
202,"July 10, 2010","Hazel was extremely knowledgeable and helpful during my car-buying experience.  This was the BEST experience I have ever had buying a car!!  I will highly recommend anyone to go to Gillman.  Furthermore, I had noticed some bubbling of the tint on the driver's side window and it was immediately taken care of and the service department was very helpful.  Thanks and I will definitely be back for future car purchases.",5.0
203,"July 09, 2010","Very informative on the Honda vehicle requested, willingly supported us and knew all about its unique features as we test drove it.Helped find the model color requested from another dealership. When this car  was not available next day he went and found another one and had it delivered and modified to our specifications. It was ready for pick up on time and he amd his team spent an hour explaining how the unique systems worked.An excellent representative who understands what customerr service means.",4.8
204,"July 09, 2010","I brought my CRV in for an inspection and two new tires.  John was very helpful and checked on the availability of the tires and explained the estimated cost. The staff was very friendly and the waiting area was neat, clean, and comfortable. My wait was right at an hour, exactly what John had estimated. I would highly recommend this location for service.",5.0
205,"July 08, 2010","I recently took my car in to have it serviced, brake pads and battery replaced. The parts salesman, Jason Gutierrez, was very helpful in explaining the different types of brake pads and batteries and assisted in choosing which parts would best suit my vehicle for an inexpensive price. The dealership alone is a safe, clean environment. The service area is nicely designed to accommodate to its waiting customers. The employees are very courteous and do a swift and very precise job. I will definitely be returning for all future mechanical needs and referring as many people as I can to do the same.",5.0
206,"July 08, 2010","I have used other parts stores in the past but too many times the part is the wrong one or just poor quality. i know Jason in honda parts will get it right the first time with a honda OEM part. They allways goes the extra mile, even on nonstocking parts.

209,"July 05, 2010","After wrecking my car, I went to Gillman Honda of Fort Bend in Rosenberg, TX to look at a small car for me and to get an idea of what it would cost for a Honda Odyssey for my wife.  Trace Pollock, Sales Consultant, showed me the Honda Fit which I test drove and liked very much.  He then showed my wife a Honda Odyssey.  When we met with Ali Sirat, the Business Manager, he worked up a deal on both vehicles which, at the time, we thought we could afford.  That night after my wife ran the numbers on the two new vehicles along with the new insurance rate that we would now be paying, we realized that we had made a mistake and would not be able to afford both vehicles.  My wife was very upset but realized that we would have to take back the Odyssey.  I arrived at the dealership the next business day, and explained to Jeff Gerschoffer, Finance Director, that I needed to return the Odyssey. I was afraid that I would be treated differently now that I was brinking back a vehicle and was pleasantly surprised when the staff was just as friendly as before.  I was told by Jeff that it would be no problem at all to return the van given that I was bringing it back within 2 business days and had not driven it more than 200 miles.  The owner of Gillman Honda, Chris Gillman, remembered me and recalled how much my wife loved the van.  He said he would accept the van back but asked that I give him 10 minutes to see if he might work some magic.  When he returned, Chris floored me by working up a deal that allowed us to keep both the Odyssey and the Fit.  My wife was so happy when I called her with the news.  I also found out the Gillman Honda can do car inspections and can work on all types of vehicles.   From now on I plan to trust Gillman with all my car needs.  ",5.0
210,"June 16, 2009","I was shown a specific car and then brought inside to negotiate purchase. After negotiations they bring me a car that was not the one I was shown and had minor dings & scratches on it and refused to sell me the car that we had all looked at stating that they had to sell me 'this one'to boost their profit margin. Prior to informing me of this they kept assuring me that I was getting the very same car I looked at. Even going as far as to tell me they had brought another car in and parked it in the empty space where mine was pulled out from (never happened). When I caught this, it was stated that I was jeust trying to get a good deal and insinuations made as to my integrity being questioned as less than honorable. I was lied to, cars switched, and then degraded when I wouldn't conform to what they wanted to do to make the most money off me. Buyer beware! These are NOT upfront, honest people. Take your business to Russell/Smith Honda or another dealer! When we tried to resolve the complaint with Chris Gillman, I was argued with and again tried to be sold the car that I didn't want. I also tried to pay cash for the car and they argued with me to finance it so they could get additional money from the finace company. I have had 3 other local dealers offer me the same cash deal for the same options. We will definitely go to another dealer where salesman don't play hide and seek with the customer",1.3
