0,"December 09, 2011","If you live in the DFW Metroplex, please pass this information along to warn others. After a quick sale at HUGGINS MITSUBISHI, I informed management (w/in 24 hours of the sale) that I wasn't happy with the car. The 2011 Eclipse GS Sport is a rough ride and excessively noisy. The GM, Crystal Goldstein, indicated that I could trade out the car at HUGGINS HONDA. I chose a dependable 2012 Honda Civic EX-L that was actually $1K cheaper than the Eclipse (that should have been an indicator). Anyhow, instead of backing out the paperwork, they attempted to trade the car in. $24K quickly became $15K....how is that possible? Anyhow, I wanted to share this information so HUGGINS MITSUBISHI/HONDA doesn't take advantage of anyone else using their unethical tactics. I've already filed with the BBB on a pricing issue I experienced with them. STAY CLEAR OF HUGGINS!!!!!",1.2
1,"July 11, 2011","The customer service at this dealership is the worse I have EVER experienced in 30 years of buying and having cars serviced at dealerships. The A/C blower went out on my Endeavor. A simple issue, you would think. I brought the resistor that I thought was bad to the parts counter and asked if they could test it to see if it was bad considering I couldn't return a new one once purchased. They refused. They told me I could buy a new resistor and take my chances that it was the bad componant or I could bring the car in and they would test it and see what was wrong. When I spoke to the service manager he told me and I quote ""We're not in business to help customers but to make money, bring in the car."" When I asked if they were going to fix the known design flaw in the evaporator drain system. His reply was ""You're out of warranty, that will cost you $1000 to fix."" A known problem that is a design flaw that occurs with every 2004 - 2008 Endeavor and I have to pay for it?

If anyone decides to do buiness with this dealership I have some ocean front property in Arizonia that I can let you have... cheap!",1.0
