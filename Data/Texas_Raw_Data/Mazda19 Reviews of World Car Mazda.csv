0,"December 04, 2019","Our family has bought many cars from World Car, New Braunfels and they have always come through for us. Kelsey Heath helped us today and she was friendly, helpful, and attentive. Also, the gentleman who handled the financial information was very clear and thorough in his explanations. I am sorry that I cannot remember his name. Thanks so much!",5.0
1,"June 20, 2019","I have taken my RX 8 to World Car several times since moving to New Braunfels. Their rotary engine mechanic is first rate, and the service personnel have always been professional and courteous. I would not go anywhere else. ",5.0
2,"May 20, 2019","My car has been in their shop since April 12, in need of a new engine! It took five days before we found out that we needed to approve breakdown process of the old engine and we didn't find this out until my wife called and asked for an update. ON APRIL 30 they began the breakdown process of the engine. The new engine arrived to the dealership last Tuesday and after we have been told repeatedly that we are being prioritize found out today that they needed to order replacement parts!!! No one offered us a rental, we were only ever told ""Kia does not have a loaner program sorry"". It will still be another week and a half before we can get our car back and that's if we are lucky! 

I am tired of all the broken promises of ""We'll call you right back, you're a priority, we want to get you back in your car ASAP."" etc. I am not blind or dumb. I know what is going on here. The dealership is stalling because it is warranty work and the worst case for them is that my wife and I are without car for however long they want to make us. WE DO NOT FEEL LIKE WE ARE CONSIDERED CUSTOMERS OR CARED FOR ONLY THAT WE ARE AN INCONVENIENCE TO THEM!!!!",1.0
3,"July 03, 2017",Worst customer service!  If I didn't love the car I purchased I would have walked away.  The employees were cocky and not helpful.  They were supposed to clean my car all they did was vacuum and wash cup holders were dirty seats had stains on it i for sure thought they would have cleaned it.  I've called several times for copies of our paperwork and never received it they wouldn't give us copies they day of.  They took forevever for everything to be done it should never take 5 hours to buy a car. I wouldn't shop here again.,2.0
4,"May 06, 2017","I purchased a car from this dealership, it was the WORST experience ever! I had a 2014 Mazda3. They called and have me the spiel about getting a new car for the same payments. When i arrived, I looked at some of the new models. I wasn't offered a test drive. I wasn't given any deals, incentives, rebates, or loyalty deals. They have me a higher interest rate and a longer term for my loan. Granted, I was tired from working all day, but I was not treated well at all. When I went back to get car washed because it hasn't been cleaned because it was 10pm when I finished, the sales manager asked how I liked the car. I said I didn't. He didn't know what to say. I explained all the issues I had with the car. He still had nothing to say. I tried to get my old car back but couldn't. The dealership manger was also not helpful. He basically said it's buyers remorse and too bad. 
The only reason I went here was because when I bought my 2014, I was treated with respect, and all my questions were answered, and I felt good about my purchase. I was happy. Apparently, the change in personnel is all about treating people like cattle going to slaughter. Get everything you can while you can. There's no relationship development. 
I would NOT recommend this dealership to ANYONE!",1.0
5,"April 22, 2017","Routine maintenance takes way too long.  Our last visit for oil change and tire rotation took more than three hours.   How long would it take if we had a serious mechanical problem?  I did make an appointment.

We bought the car new last year and they promise free oil and filter changes for I think two years.  That small benefit is not worth dealing with the service department.  If you show them required maintenance in the owners manual they argue about doing the work.  If they do agree to the work you will be waiting a LONG time.

I will pay for oil changes myself and get it done at Legend KIA which is about 10 miles south on IH 35.

The brakes seemed to be grabbing and I took it to Legend KIA.  Very professional, friendly staff and it was finished before the projected time.  

Guess where I will be taking my KIA in the future for maintenance and buying my next KIA?",2.0
6,"March 04, 2017","The most unprofessional car dealership I have ever dealt with. Fake rip off bait & switch style with undertrained younger salesmen  followed by an unbelievably rude attitude demonstrated by sloppy, disheveled, upper level ""manager"" Ronnie Kyle. AVOID THIS PLACE! Just buy online from Costco...hassle free and MUCH better prices.",1.0
7,"March 10, 2016",Sales person was incompetent. We were promised replacement parts that were not ordered. We had them ordered finally. We were informed to come in for a 2nd key we were promise. Who knew it would be a tortuous 2 hour event? I guess our time wasted is of no consequence to them. The incompetence continues. Avoid this dealer. Not worth the hassle.,2.0
8,"May 04, 2015","I bought my Nissan at World Car and had no issues so I thought this would be the same. Went there after Rudy Martinez called me to tell me the car I was interested in had arrived. Went there with the intention to buy but the first thing he said it had not been checked in and prepared for sale so they didn't even let us test drive it. Ok, we started talking price and after they showed me the MSRP I told them I was looking for a better price. They asked me what I wanted to pay and after he presented it to their manager, he came back to let me NO. No counter, no manager, didn't even come out tower with us, so we left. ",1.0
9,"July 28, 2014",We have never had such a bad experience at a dealer!  It's pretty sad that a small car dealer I went to jumped through hoops to get me in the car I wanted. But we went to this place and our salesman didn't even try to help us. Chris just wanted to try to put us in the junk they can't get rid of!  We will never be back!  ,1.0
10,"February 04, 2014","I have a Mazda Miata, and a Kia Rio, both of which are serviced at World Car New Braunfels. The service department always gets me in and out very quickly, sometimes even without an appointment. 

The service manager Matt Alexander is great, and he and the advisers always explain all work being done in detail. Also, no matter how busy Matt is, he always makes time to come and speak with me, even when it doesn't pertain to work being done on my cars. 

Once when one of my cars had to stay over night, I was given a ride to my home in Canyon Lake, which is 20 miles away.

It's a pleasure doing business with World Car New Braunfels, and I recommend them highly.",5.0
11,"January 27, 2014",I bought my car from World Car a couple of years ago and have been going there ever since for service on my car. I always get great service for a great price in a very timely manner. This last time I got a regular service maintenance on my car as well as an oil change and I received a call from the technician asking if they would like for me to update my state inspection while they were working on my car since it expired at the end of the month. I have only had positive experiences here! ,5.0
12,"January 09, 2014","Me and my wife came in over the weekend to buy a new Kia Soul. Chris Jones was very helpful, we didn't feel mislead for one second, and we ended up with a great deal on the car. If you are looking for a new car, talk to Chris first :) -",4.8
13,"December 26, 2013",The service department at World Car Mazda/Kia has always been great to get my car in on short notice.  They explain everything clearly and never tried to add something on to the invoice after having quoted me a price.  These guys work hard to make their customers happy.,5.0
14,"November 13, 2013",Everyone was so helpful and friendly.  A great service team. An overall pleasant experience.  We love our Kia Sorento.Thank you for taking such good care of us. The 100 dollar discount card was very nice too.,5.0
15,"September 18, 2013",The service was great. The people there are also very friendly. I came in for an oil change and forgot my coupon but Justin found me an even better one. They're very quick but also very thorough. You receive a written report of what they did and they also made recommendations. I highly recommend World Car and I have referred them to many of my friends and family. ,5.0
16,"July 19, 2013","This dealership cares about its customers.... The are not ""pushy"" and I def appreciate that.  Most of the salesmen I've interacted with gave me very reasonable advice with my car purchase.  Jerry Lew was my actual salesman.  He was great! When we go in for service, he always remembers us. I think that's pretty neat. Btw, the service dept is great too!  Always helpful and fast!",5.0
17,"June 04, 2013","On May 10th, I purchased my 3rd Kia (2-Souls & 1-Sportage) from World Car Kia in New Braunfels.  I have been dealing with this Dealership since Oct 2011, and have been EXTREMELY SATISFIED, in the Sales, Service & Parts Depts.  The Sportage is my 30th+ Vehicle Purchase, in my lifetime.  This is THE BEST DEALER, I have ever dealt with!  I have owned Chevy, Ford, VW, Jeep, Saturn, Plymouth, Toyota, Nissan, Suzuki, Hyundai and Kia.  For the most part, I either got GOOD SALES or GOOD SERVICE, but NOT both,  at most of the Dealers I have dealt with in the past.  However, I'm one HAPPY CAMPER, when it comes to dealing with my World Car Kia Dealer.  I like that they're located less than 3 miles from my Home, which makes it convenient when I have to have Service done.  I always receive a Fair Price for my Trade-In's, as well as a Fair Price for my Purchases there.  The Service Dept has been absolutely PHENOMENAL, in meeting my needs and requests, on all three cars I have purchased from them.

On May 20th, I brought my Sportage in to the Service Dept, to see about having the Side Steps removed, that were Factory Installed.  They hindered my wife and I, from getting In/Out of the vehicle.  After talking with Justin in Service, he coordinated with Justin & Johnny in Parts, and they ordered the Panel Covers & Hardware, that would be installed in place of the Side Steps.  The parts were ordered on that Monday, came in Thursday, and I had an appointment to bring my Sportage in on the 27th.

I dropped off my Sportage the morning of the 27th, and received a Courtesy Ride Home.  A few hours later, I got a call that it was done, and my wife dropped me off to pick it up (which gave her an excuse to go Shopping...).  My Sportage looked GREAT!  It was also much easier to get In/Out of my car.  The Service Dept Techs, had placed my Side Steps and Hardware, in the Cardboard Boxes that the Panel Covers had come in, and carefully fit them into my Cargo area, so I could get them home.

In the past, I've had the Service Dept add Fog Lights to my 1st Soul, add a Rear Spoiler to my 2nd Soul, and now remove the Side Steps from my Sportage.  Each and every request, was ALWAYS met with, ""WE CAN DO IT""!  Which is not something you hear too many places say, nowadays!  It's both refreshing and satisfying, to FINALLY Deal with a Dealership, that knows the meaning of, ""CUSTOMER SERVICE""!  On behalf of my wife and I, we THANK YOU ALL, very much!  Gene & Ann W.",5.0
18,"August 07, 2012","Gigaintic 3 hour waste of time. Like to play games with the customers. Wondered why we were the only customers in the dealership - now we know. If you are looking for
a good deal or even a fair deal- don't expect to find it here.",1.8
