0,"January 28, 2020","This would be a five-star-plus review, save for one matter discussed below.

Sewell dealerships are dramatically different from the stereotypical auto sales environment. We helped my son purchase a vehicle from their Infiniti location a couple of years back, and were impressed with the experience. Sales associates are true professionals ... college graduates, articulate, well-dressed and exceptionally courteous. The atmosphere is calm and welcoming, and every aspect is focused on the customer. Pre-owned vehicles not of their brands are exclusively buyer trade-ins ... no used rental cars or ""auction specials"". I thus had every confidence that the 2017 Acura MDX Advance I was interested in would be a quality automobile.

I was warmly and almost immediately greeted by Amy Douthit, who verified that the car was available, and went over Sewell's way of doing business, emphasizing that if any pre-owned auto does not meet its stringent criteria, it's shipped out. The MDX was in virtual showroom condition, the test drive went well, as expected, and negotiations were conducted in a low-key manner. We couldn't agree on the value of my trade, despite Amy's couple of back-and-forth trips to the manager's office, as well as a visit from AJ, the man himself. There was no pressure, no hesitation returning my keys, no chasing me in the parking lot with another offer, and no insisting that the deal was ""good for today only"" ... the way it should be. The disagreement notwithstanding, we parted on favorable terms, although I still had considerable interest in the Acura.

The following morning, I took my vehicle to one of those Sell-Us-Your-Car places, and was offered what I anticipated was its value. I relayed the information to Amy, who presented it to the manager on duty. Here's where the ""Until ..."" comes in:

Amy called me back, obviously repeating management's contention that they actually beat the offer, when the difference in sales tax between selling and trading is factored in. It's an age-old gimmick used by dealers to allow less for a trade-in. Sales tax has absolutely nothing to do with the value of a vehicle ... whether selling outright or trading in, it's worth what it's worth. I expressed my intense disappointment, stating that I didn't expect such trickery from Sewell. This tactic shouldn't ever be in their playbook, considering their reputation. Shortly thereafter, I received a call from Jack Mah, apologizing for the ""misunderstanding"", as well as agreeing to match the better offer.  While the deal was to my liking, I still wanted to think it over, especially given what had just occurred.

I ultimately agreed to the terms, returned, and drove out in my new (to me) Acura. Katy Murray handled the final paperwork in a manner consistent with Sewell's philosophy ... courteously with no sales pitch for extras, and a very understandable description of everything I signed (it was a cash transaction, so there was considerably less work for both of us).

I trust that those I dealt with took my comments in the spirit intended, and that upper management will eliminate that bit of deception from its lexicon. The car is exceptional, and I'm glad that all eventually turned out well.

1,"December 30, 2018","Brought my A7 in for a tire alignment and the gentleman named Leo Calderon greeted me saying ""whats up man"" instead of by my name like they normally do since I schedule appointments and show up on time. A day later as I am driving to work I receive notification that my hood is open, so I pull over, check it out and what do we have here? One side of my hood will not latch. Thanks Audi North Houston now I have to make another trip out to the dealership, get greeted as ""Man, your car is ready"" again for something I am not responsible for. First something was taken from my car previously during a routine service and not put back or reimbursed, now my hood will not latch properly. Thanks again...",1.8
2,"October 16, 2018","I've been a long time Audi customer. I'm on my 5th Audi and I used to service at Millennium before Sewell took over. The service over the years (after Millennium) was night and day different. I was so impressed with Sewell. I've had to take my 2017 A7 that I purchased new there in 3 times in the past 6 months and I feel like I'm having Millennium flashbacks. I've seen service advisors with dip in their mouth in their office, I've overhead employees complaining about how terrible their customers are and it just seems like the nice ""customer service"" attitude is gone. I don't know what happened to this place but unfortunately I can't see myself going back. ",1.6
3,"July 13, 2017","I have purchased two vehicles from this location and their service is next to none! I've visited numerous location for service and each time I'm very disappointed at the service and the attitudes I receive from the the representatives present. Each and every time I step in the Audi North Houston location I am greater with a smile and a representative that goes above and beyond to meet my needs whether it's a new vehicle, maintenance, or a general question. I refuse to shop anywhere else. The immaculate service exceeds all. It really matters when you are paying for a service and not a car and they truly appreciate your business. It is reflective in each and every employee, including the individuals that only pick up and drop your vehicle off. Everyone goes the extra mile to ensure customer satisfaction at all cost! They will continue to get my business due to the relationship that has been built based on their customer service, trust and loyalty. Words can't express my true gratitude to each and every individual that keeps this place going. ",5.0
4,"June 20, 2017","Walked in with my son who was ready to purchase a car. We were fortunate to have Mark Lane help us out. He was very personable and easy to work with. Even though I was there to obvserve the process, have never been more impressed with the thoughtfulness of the customer through the entire process. Would recommend to anyone looking for a vehicle!",5.0
5,"January 03, 2017","A million thanks to Mark Lane for making the car buying/trade-in process seamless and enjoyable. I live in Dallas but found a Range Rover in Audi North Houston's inventory that I loved. Mark worked to get more on my Mercedes GLK trade-in than Mercedes offered me, beat the financing terms that I was offered by my lender and personally delivered the Range Rover to me in Dallas. What sets Mark and this dealership apart are what happened after the deal closed - I have called Mark with a few questions regarding the vehicle and he always returns my call the same day (including weekends and the call I inadvertently placed on a holiday). The customer service I received at this dealership is unparalleled and I will only purchase vehicles from Audi North Houston moving forward.",5.0
6,"October 17, 2016"," This was our first experience shopping for an Audi. The dealership treated us like royalty and we received respectful, courteous, and prompt attention. Please ask for Jon Niskanen, a sales associate who is extremely knowledgeable and able to explain every feature you'd like to learn about. He helped us find the best car to meet our needs and was not pushy or aggressive in any way. The showroom was immaculate and the speed with which we were able to reach a haggle-free, fair price was unlike any buying experience I've ever had. I cannot say enough nice things about the process and the people who work there. Everyone we encountered seemed so willing to help and provide us with white glove service. It really made us feel special.",5.0
7,"September 08, 2016","Absolutely, the worst Service I have ever experienced in my life!!! I took my Audi to the dealership thinking that their service would be what’s best for my car. Well that couldn’t be farther from the truth! They not only RIPPED ME OFF but they couldn’t even figure out what was wrong with the car. The funny part is that I asked them to check the key Because I knew that that was what was causing the problem. They refused to start with the simplest solution. They kept dragging me back and forth, back and forth racking up a HUGE BILL!!! Which was fine but then they tell me, “Uhhhh we don’t know what’s wrong with the vehicle.”  
After much discussion they finally change the key. Well what do you know, there it goes working like a charm!!!!! Whether they really didn’t know what was wrong with my car OR they just wanted to start with the most expensive project, it tells you what kind of CROOKS these people really are. They were very rude about it as well. No apologies at all. In fact, when I spoke to the manager, I felt like he was in on it and this was the norm! People like this are the reason why dealerships and mechanics have a bad reputation!! Save your money and time folks!!! DO NOT BOTHER WITH THESE THEIVES!!!! ",1.0
8,"February 02, 2016","It seems to me every time I went in for service on my wife's car, it was a issue to get them to perform only the service needed. The issue for me with them is one of trust. Our Car is four years old now and we will be going back to Lexus, people we trust...",1.8
9,"November 03, 2015",I live in Katy and work in the Woodland. So I have had my work. I have my car serviced here. Everytime they comeback that I need something else on top of my  scheduled services. I was talking to another customer there and she told me she get the some thing. What kind of business is this. And how many people do they do this too. Now I know why Sewell is SO RICH!,1.8
10,"January 24, 2015","The service, price and staff at North Houston Audi are nothing short of amazing!  Danny (Manager) and Joel (salesperson) sold me 7, yes you read correct, 7 cars last year.  Ranging from R8, RS7 to a simple A6 for the 'airport car'.  These guys are straight shooters and have the best prices in Texas--period.  There are other dealers in Austin where I live, but they are a joke compared to North Houston Audi and I buy all of my cars out of town.  North Houston makes it easy every time.  They even ship the car to me--that is personal service above and beyond.

If you're even thinking about an Audi, these are your guys.  I will continue to buy Audi's from North Houston and get the best service (white glove every time) Audi has to offer.",5.0
11,"April 03, 2014","Want personal attention with first class service? Then I would highly recommended the Audi North Houston dealership. The Sewell team will always take great care of you and treats you like family.
Their quality of work and expertise are always top notch. ",4.8
12,"September 21, 2013","Awesome experience. Great treatment at drop off and excellent communication through out the service cycle. 
I had my Audi and Jeep(serviced at autonation up the road) both in the shop at the same time. I sent my 18 year old son to pick them both up. He came back and asked why would anyone ever buy anything other than an Audi as he said the treatment was night and day. 
FYI, the sticker price of the two vehicles was identical so Jeep has no excuse however it seems to be the norm in Houston.
Continue to love our Audi!",5.0
13,"December 11, 2012","Fantastic buying experience from the first point of contact. I emailed the dealership and was contacted within a day. I made an appointment to view a certified pre-owned vehicle, and was treated with incredible professionalism. The negotiations were very short and the final agreed price was extremely fair. The items that needed to be addressed were identified and agreed upon and an appointment was made for a few days later. 

I would recommend this dealership for the courteous sales and service representatives.",5.0
14,"October 02, 2012","I recently purchased a 2013 Audi S4 from John Hovenden at Audi North Houston.  I special ordered the vehicle and everything was explained to me up front and straight forward.  While waiting for the vehicle to arrive, I received regular updates on its progress and arrival date.  There was no pressure to purchase extras when finalizing the sale.  After the paperwork was completed, John went over every feature on the car to ensure I knew how each option worked. I would rank it as the best experience I've ever had purchasing a car.",5.0
15,"September 28, 2012",We bought an Audi A5 form John Hoventon on 9-25-12. He provided great service and was very helpful in us getting the exact car we wanted in a timely manner. He made the overall experience very pleasant and there were no surprises. If you want to deal with a very professional salesman and want to be treated in a classy way please use John. Brent,5.0
16,"September 08, 2012","LOVE MY PURCHASE!!! I have to honestly say that my experience in purchasing my CTS was flawless. After searching (for a while) for my car and found one I was interested in, I sent an email and was contacted by John Hovenden from Audi North Houston. He was incredible and can't thank him enough for making the whole experience stress free. I was an hour away from the dealership and he handled everything with perfect, timely communication so that when I was ready to buy... all I needed to do was go sign and pick up my car. Note, this is an Audi dealership and I purchased a Cadillac...there was no pressure or attempt to pursaude me from what I had been looking for and for that I am appreciative of as well. John did a great job, extremely professional and efficient. I'll be back!!! Give him a call, you wont be disappointed. ",5.0
17,"August 06, 2012","These guys sold Audi A4 2008, by showing Clean car Fax, but the car already involved in an Accident, Air bags deployed, front bumper damaged, they replaced them and by showing clean Car fax, They shown the car fax report before accident, by showing the before Accident car fax, they sold the car. Now they are not responding properly, I called many times and I left voice mail, no one responding. 
    They are saying that, It is not their mistake, some one sold to them and they sold to me. how they provide extended warranty with out checking the engine and parts. Finally I lost around 5000$ on this CAR.",2.2
18,"July 17, 2011","We purchased a Q-5 from Sewell, and were very pleased with the service and attention from Chris Childs.  He found our perfect car quickly and at a fair price.  The entire staff at Sewell North Houston is professional, friendly, polished and exceeded all of our expectations. Sewell is a true believer in ""customer first"".  We were so impressed, that we went next door to Sewell Infiniti and purchased another vehicle, and were once again pleased with the over the top experience!  I would recommend a Sewell dealership to anyone!",5.0
19,"June 26, 2011","Purchasing my Audi from Sewell Audi North was by far the best experience and best choice I could have made.  I've always heard about Sewell's customer service and I can confirm that it is all true.  Chris Childs and everyone at the dealership made my experience not only refreshingly easy, but they made the transaction first class.  I will only buy at Sewell from now on.  ",5.0
