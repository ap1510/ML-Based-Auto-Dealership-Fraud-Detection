4,"April 28, 2020","Due to the COVID-19 issues and the associated stay-at-home guidelines, we had not been able to complete the initial service on my wife's new Lexus at our usual dealer in El Paso.  Circumstances came up that required us to be in Lubbock to support my daughter and the new granddaughter.  We didn't plan on having the vehicle serviced in Lubbock, but the warning light for service needed convinced my wife to contact the Alderson Lexus Service Department to see about service that day.  To our surprise, Rudy Salazar was able to schedule the service and complete it on time that afternoon.  I appreciated Rudy's texts to keep us informed of the progress of the service as well as the complimentary wash.  I will keep Alderson in mind when the time comes to replace the wife's current Lexus.

183,"March 26, 2018","I took my 7 yr-old Lexus 350 in for the airbag recall and to have the auto windshield wiper sensor adjusted. As Alderson Lexus of Lubbock is nearly a 3 hr drive from home, I requested a loaner car to use for the anticipated 5-6 hr service. To my utter delight, I didn't have to argue my case or even ask twice. Loaner car -- CHECK! In the 2 weeks leading up to my appointment, I received 3 reminder emails from Customer Care Rep Alexis Ochoa, each with a detailed explanation of the service to be performed, time, and expected use of a loaner car. Customer/Service Dept. communication -- CHECK! Upon arrival, I was greeted by  a robustly happy Service Rep named Rudy Salazar, who had all the paperwork ready with my loaner car parked front and center, ready for me to drive away. Speedy check-in -- CHECK! Rudy called me promptly when the service was complete, just 5 hrs shy of when it was dropped off. Efficient service -- CHECK! Rudy greeted me near the end of his Friday workday as enthusiastically as he had when I arrived. My Lexus was staged, ready to go, and as I gathered my belongings from the interior of the loaner, Rudy had unexpectedly transferred my shopping items from the one trunk to the other, before I even stepped out of the loaner. Courteous service -- CHECK! The adjustment to my wiper sensor was not a big deal, but as my son was recently charged $50.00 labor to have his gas cap replaced at a GM dealership in Amarillo, TX, I expected to be charged for labor. There was no charge for the minor adjustment from Alderson. Fair dealing -- CHECK! As I drove away from Alderson, I was happy to see that the interior was spotless and the accumulation of bugs collected on the trip down had been cleaned away from the windshield. I drove the conveniently short distance to I27 before I glanced at my gas gauge to plan a gas stop on the way home. Surprisingly, my tank was full! Jaw-dropping thoughtfulness -- CHECK!",5.0

211,"December 14, 2017","Just a quick note to tell ever one what a great service we received on our 2017 RX-350. Even though this was for the 5000 mile check with tire rotation the service was quick and the care that Robin Hood took of our vehicle was second to none.

Thanks for coming to Midland (saved us a 220 mile round trip for the same service).

I have bought plenty of luxury vehicles all from top notch dealers and have always had great experiences with luxury dealers until Alderson.  I suspect it's because they are the only game in town for luxury cars.  They never have loaners available, their sales department is arrogant and lazy.  They won't even get up to greet you and their service department can never fix your cars problem if it has one.  My advice is buy in the metroplex.  You will save money and have far superior service.  I try to service in the metroplex whenever possible.",1.0
