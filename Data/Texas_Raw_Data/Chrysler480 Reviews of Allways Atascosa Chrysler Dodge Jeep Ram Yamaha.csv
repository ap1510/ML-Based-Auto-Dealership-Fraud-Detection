3,"January 21, 2020","Disappointed in the service I received. When I arrived the guy was too busy on the phone had me standing for about 15 minutes until he finally asked me to sit. The 2 customers who were behind me seemed to be regular customers and were pushed in line in front of me, my car was finished and parked in the front and I waited for someone to come talk to me and I had to approach the front and tell them my car was ready. I used a coupon that was oil service and tire Rotation, since I was in a hurry the gentleman didn’t even acknowledge the fact that I used a coupon and he didn’t validate everything that it was offering. He didn’t explain any of e notes that they found in the inspection nor did he offer or try to advise me in what they could to fix the issues and how much it would cost. Not going back ",1.0

33,"December 18, 2019","I was extremely upset with the High price that I was quoted  for a complete brake job. I was quoted a reasonable fee at IPAC and the labor cost here was doubled. I went ahead and let them do the front brakes but after taking my truck to Brake Check, found out that they did not resurface the rotors on the front. Not did they offer any warranty on the brake pads. I do urge folks to not use them for service unless it is warranty work. Buyer beware!!!",1.0

Told me it would be painted to match and ready for install in about 10 days. 2 months later after 10 unreturned calls it's finely ready. I go in to install and it's the wrong color. A couple weeks later it's ready for install. The total was more than double the original quote. $600 UNBELIEVABLE!,1.8
42,"December 12, 2019","I have had my truck over at the dealership five times now since I bought it on October 26th. They do fix everything on each visit. My check engine light continues to come on two to three days after I bring it home for something completely different. The dealership is working with me to make me a satisfied customer and I do appreciate their efforts. They are continuing to work with me and I look forward to their resolution for me in the future. I will keep you all updated.  ..........UPDATE.......
Check engine light episode number 6 they have told me it is the downstream nox sensor they said they replaced it and they are now putting miles on it to see if there may be a number 7 check engine light come on. So with many miles put on the vehicle by the dealer to try to figure out the problems  what can I expect in the future.  Can they make me a satisfied customer  so far it looks grim I asked myself  6 check engine lights in 7 weeks what is the problem.  So far everything seems to be associated with the DEF system.",1.8

49,"December 05, 2019","They seem to fix only the first problem that pops up on the scan of the system and then they clear out the other problems hoping they will go away. I must say they fix the first problem on the scan each time but come on!!! I have had the last two scans done by a professional mechanic and there were a number of codes that set the check engine light to come on.  He told me he could fix it but at a price and Always is working on the problem without a cost to me, so to save major money I take it to them each time. I have had my truck over to the service center four times already.  This last time they replaced one of the  NOX sensors, the first code to set the check engine light on not the only code but the first one.  I picked it up on Tuesday 12-3-19 and the check engine light came on again this morning 12-5-2019.  I bought the vehicle on 10-26-2019 and it has been in their service center four times now, they have had the vehicle longer than I have. I live over 50 miles one way from their dealership and I have put over 400 miles on the vehicle just taking it to the service center.  Now I need to take it in again!!!!! They have given me a loaner each time but how frustrating this has become to deal with these people. I am at my wit's end I have tried to keep a good attitude but my patience is growing shallow. Always Atascosa showed great review for a truck dealership so I was excited to go there and find a vehicle that fit my needs, Greg helped me out and I thought I made a very informed decision at a good not great but good price.  I was happy, but that is changing very quickly now.  I will keep this review updated!!!!   PLEASE ALWAYS ATASCOSA HELP ME OUT.",1.8

56,"November 15, 2019","My guy Jesse in the service department always take care of my truck needs whenever I have little services as in a oil change. But this recent visit was more on the major risk he was able to take a look at my truck and noticed my fuel pump was failing and I needed a new one. Most dealership service personnel would simply schedule me for the following day, but not Jesse he checked to see if the part was available and got me in and out right before closing time. He also explained to me that if I didn’t get this service done the consequences that would follow so without risking my transportation I went ahead and got it done.

91,"October 07, 2019"," The term “ lifetime customer” used  to mean something.  Loyalty will always be a two-way street.  Purchased a 2006 Chrysler 300 on a Saturday.  Sunday the parking brake light came on and would not go off after Parking brake was disengaged. Took the vehicle to Brake Check. Diagnosis: Rotors worn beyond safety  perimeters . Additionally, technician informed me that it may or may not be the problem. Nevertheless, rotors needed to be replaced For safety reasons. OK, spend just under $600 replacing brake parts. However, sadly, the problem with the brake light remaining on continued.  So, I reached out to the dealership (Jacob Cowan).  Explained the situation about the parking brake light and the constant alarm.  Then asked if the service department could help me out and take a look? I was told, “definitely.” “The service manager will give you a call.”  Meanwhile, over 10 days later, still waiting for that call. “Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me.”  My daughter will need a vehicle within the next six months.  I would have her take the city bus before purchasing another vehicle from this dealership.",1.0

The prices for their vehicles are a bit on the high side. After we purchased the truck on Friday. it had to go to service to have some things done, including new tires. We were first told it would be ready Tuesday. It was not ready, or even started on. Apparently sales did not communicate to service when it needed to be done. Was told it would be a couple of days. We had asked to have a couple items checked and a water pump replaced, figured $200-300, unless some things had to be replaced. They didn’t need to be replaced but the bill was over $800. The parts you can get for a reasonable price but we were charged exorbitant amounts for parts. Labor costs were pretty much average. Went back on Saturday only to find it hadn’t been cleaned yet. Was told it would be ready on Monday or Tuesday and would be delivered to us. Gave us a loaner. Called Tuesday, would be delivered Wednesday, depending on weather. Called Wednesday was told it would be delivered on Thursday for sure. It finally arrived Thursday, mid afternoon. Almost two weeks after purchase. I really liked the people I met there.

209,"April 10, 2019",Jessie the service rep has gone above and beyond to take care of the customer. The truck went in for brakes and fluids change. Found to have a failing rear axle they took care of it and rebuilt the axle. The had to be returned to service department the next day due to a severe shake in the drive train. They are still working on the truck as of this  review. Service department is top notch. Wish I could say the truck was as good. This truck and my last ram both had a failure of the rear axle. And with all the recalls on this truck I would be hard pressed to purchase another Ram truck. When you are uncertain of the trucks reliability and you have to choose your other vehicle to take on a long trip. Would you buy the same truck again? ,3.8

369,"September 26, 2018","My sells person, Bryce Jupe, was very nice and polite but I do have some complaints about my experience.
I left my trade in vehicle with 3/4 a tank of gas, I understand that was my doing, however the truck I bought only had 34 miles left in the tank when I drove off the lot. My husband was nice enough to fill up my new truck
I have a family and completely understand that sometimes people have to leave. Bryce left the stuff that was in my Durango on the floor the F&I Samantha Rangel Peacock's office and didn't say ""Hey i have to go it was great doing business with you"", he just left and laughed when I asked if he found the million dollars in my car.
Then as soon as I signed the financing lady, Samantha, was grabbing her purse and left even before I was out of the door.
Then no one took me to the truck, we had to find it and there was another truck in front of our truck, so it took us a while. No one came out to assist and I'm sure some one saw us wondering around as the front is all glass.
Then when I did get to the truck. I had to go back in for some one to find the other key. Everyone looked at me as though it was my fault for not having it.
I have worked both in the private and public sector and the one thing that I know is that customer service is the only way you will ever get ahead in the game.
Really I was an easy sell (had basically everything done online before we arrived and took the truck that I had already picked out before seeing) and didn't really make it hard on anyone, other than myself. I chose to drive down and purchase from them because Bryce wasn't pushy but I still deserved customer service. He was giving wonderful customer service to the older group in the lobby.

Someone must have smelled it because there were 6 air fresheners recently place in the car.  3 on the vents and 3 hanging from the blinker and wiper control arms.

Called @5pm to see if it was done, I was told it'd have to be tomorrow. I said thats unexceptionable because I already waited a week for my appointment and was told it would be done today, she said ok well I can't get it done in an hour so I said I'll just come pick it up, then she said ok and hung up. She called back a few minutes later can asked if they could keep it until tomorrow at lunch I said no I have an appointment with my oncology surgeon tomorrow and I need my car, and she said ok and hung up.

My father in law came in to get a quote for a transmission repair on a 2004 dodge truck, to be taken advantage of.  Seriously happy he called us before he paid $15,000 (yes that is right fifteen thousand dollar quote) for a new transmission!  So serious the service manager should be fired for trying to take advantage of an old man.  I looked up the avg cost of transmission replacement and did not find anything higher than $5,000.

469,"July 21, 2016",We have a 2014 Dodge Ram 3500 slt that after fighting with dodge corp. I was told to pick a dealership. I thought since it was closer it would be ok for them to run test dodge corp order . Well the truck was taken Into dealership Sept2015 they finally started In oct looking at things but never really getting into what the the problem really was. Finally I was told that they were taking pics to send to dodge anyways don't really know what happened or what they found out. All I know is they took a truck 2014 with 15668 miles on it tore it completely apart including the entire motor and never put it back together and then it was put outside the nothing covered and left it in the weather now it is completely ruined. Everything rusted parts All inside the truck ruined my seats. Have things in the truck that don't belong to us and parts off the truck that had nothing to do with the problem. Anyways when I call GM he told me sue I don't care it is me.. Wow you would think he would act a little bit better than acting like he doesn't give a xxxx about anything. Place sucks wouldn't tell anyone to go there  nor to ever buy a dodge they don't stand behind anything. But who better to represent dodge who don't stand behind their product a dealership who doesn't care about customer nor the dealership!!! ,1.0

471,"March 26, 2015","I made a service appointment 2 months in advance to change a leaking heater core. I was told this was a 1 day project..... Took them a total of 6 days to do the work. Lied to me several times saying my truck would be completed by lunch tomorrow... The 3rd time I heard that I walked out of their office and into their shop to find my truck that was supposed to be ready in an hour, was still completely disassembled( seats out, steering column out, dash out) and the new heater core was laying in a bench table still waiting to be installed because the old leaking one was still in the truck.  The service manager, mechanic, and I had a short heart to heart about my expectations and the stories I had been told. Well 2 days later I get my truck back...  the air conditioner no longer works. And the vents come out of defrost while turned to vent/ air from vents while turned to defrost. Everything is backwards. After over a month of arguing with them they decided "" nothing we done while changing the heater core could have caused those issues, but they would help me out and check things out"" well scheduled another appointment a month out and they keep the truck 2 days and fix the vent location issue but the air conditioner still doesn't work and they have no diagnosis for it. Long story short I now have the truck at a local mechanic shop and when he checks things out, Atascosa dodge had broken a door inside the hvac box while installing the heater core... Guess who gets to buy a new box and pay an actual mechanic to install it? It ain't the folks who broke it because "" they couldn't have caused the issue or broken the door because they didn't work on that area of the truck""... Well the door broken is inside the box with the heater core.... This dealer will never see a red cent from my pocket and I hope each of you learn from my mistake. ",1.0

473,"July 09, 2013",I took my 2002 Jeep in because is wounld not stay running was it started.  I was told by the service department that the instrument cluster was bad and need to be replaced.  After 4 weeks on back order I took the car home and ordered my own part nad installed it.  I then took it back to the dealershipt to have the new part programmed to my car which was required by Jeep.  The service depart told me it stillahed the same problem and that it wasn't the instrument cluster but may be the body control module.  Now that did not fix the problem their solution is to pay a technician 100 dollars and hours to touble shoot wire by wire to fine the problem.  I don't thik that throwing parts at it is the right answer nor do I think I should pay to train their technicians to learn how to toubleshoot a problem.

478,"June 29, 2011","Since 2007 when buying my dodge its had problems. Dodge never stood behind it.  Then the engine went up. It took a month to get an estimate and at that I had to show up in the service area after shoulder surgery to get that!!!!!! I was told $4300.00 to put another engine in... I was promised that there was no chance of it going over the 4300.00 since they have OVER estimated it.  When I got my truck hey wanted $4800.00!!!!! I threw a fit!  Never did anyone call to get an ok to go over the agreed on amount!

They went to $4500.00 and refused to allow me to have the truck until paying the outrageous amount!  As it sat in the parking lot sqealing... I demanded a mechanic get out there and find out why a new engine was sqealing!  He says oh it will stop its just been sitting...It never stopped!  The truck ran noticably rough and continued to sqeal... called several more times and then took it in... they hooked it up... nothing wrong ma'am its $100.00 charge~  WHAT!!!! can you not see its shaking and here the sqeal!  Yes, then maybe if you install the $500.00 chip it may help!!!!!!  ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!!!!!  well now 24000,00 miles later my truck sits at a dodge dealer in San Antonio, with coolant running threw cylindars 1 and 2 with a giant oil leak... oh and the sqeek!  The belts were threated wrong...how bout that... now I am made to tow (at $165.00) my trk to atascosa Dodge... the partner and service managers treated me as if I was a nut... How would you feel after trying for a year to get them to listen... now I am paying $30.oo a day plus rental insurance to have something to drive until when ever they get my truck fixed!  So I am out way too much... and I play on making them pay for all the aggervation they have caused unless they take care of all the bills!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
