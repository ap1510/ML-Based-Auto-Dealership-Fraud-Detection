1,"July 23, 2019","1st off this is NOT A FAKE REVIEW...this actually happened this past weekend & yesterday. And trust me they are def going to take this down but its gonna come right bck to WARN OTHERS...BUYER BEWARE GO TO OTHER Kia dealers cause this place WILL SCREW UR CREDIT & U STILL WONT GET A CAR. My story.
Contacted them because they insisted they could work with my credit...they insisted they could i can not stress this enough...a week b4 i came...yes we can, yes ma'am definitely. I insisted that they be sure B4 i came, well i come in on Friday, 7/19/19 around 2:30 ish & start the process with Faisel Hossain (that should hv been my 1st clue the name because) who pretends to be above board, honest & up front but it's a big front, he's a liar & a cheat not to be trusted...come to find out this is a family run franchised dealership the brother same last name Hossain is the Finance Director & the mama Hossain is some kind of director there also.

After being there well over 7 hrs on 7/19/19 they tell me we got a deal done now catch this...HERE ARE THE KEYS just come bck on Monday 7/22/19 to get it detailed & a fillup on gas...now u would think if u r letting the customer drive off in the vehicle...its truly a done deal...so i leave my job early enough to do this missing 3 hrs of work only to be told after i get there ""sorry we cant get u financed & hv 2 take the car bck"". Excuse me what, i've had the car for a whole weekend...do u hv a ride home"", ""excuse me what again...the bald headed black guy Mark Jackson whose title in name only is 1 of the supposed business managers walks around like he owns the place, the other salesmen were down low telling me he is a butt hole & i found it to be true. David, 1 of the so called sales mgrs finally comes out looking stupid apologizing now mind u I DROVE OFF IN THE VEHICLE at their insistence that i was approved! Of course, now my credit is really shot to xxxx because they ran it for 2 xxxx days & I STILL DONT HV A CAR...Do not go here! BUYER BEWARE! As i walked around nobody pulled off in anything...a couple with a newborn baby informed they had been there since 1 pm yesterday & was also getting the run around (a clue), the husband was pissed because they took them thru BS as well. This dealership runs a sleazy business & their reviews are fake & BS. Faisel Hossain DO NOT TRUST THIS GUY, u hear his name RUN!!! Josh, a salesman DO NOT TRUST HIM, RUN! he just works there. David, Sales Mgr is a dumb butt & knows nothing!! they attempt to take your money & WILL screw up ur credit & DO NOT DELIVER. BUYER BEWARE. Remember I drove off in the vehicle I didnt hv 2 return 4 the free gas & car wash. Being an honest person being upfront will get u taken advantage of here. Tidbit...they kept asking for my pay stub saying they couldnt find it in my file but whn they BS'd me all of a sudden i got ALL MY PAPERWORK (check stubs etc) BACK funny that. Faisel Hossain & family will be reported to the proper authorities 4 DECEPTIVE TRADE PRACTICES & ima tell everyone DO NOT GO THERE U WILL NOT LEAVE WITH A CAR..TRUST THAT!! They are gonna take this post down & ima put another 1 right bck up.
• BUYER BEWARE. They know they did me wrong because I live in Plano Tx, they sent an UBERX to take me from Arlington to Plano & yes I did tell the driver who was flabbergasted & will pass it on word of mouth advertising. Remember the name Faisel Hossain & family (they run this place) John Gollie Internet Sales Mgr (never saw him), David, Sales Mgr, Jeremy Wiggains, General Manager.
• They just want the foot traffic no cars are being sold here.
• Suffice it say, I travel lots & always rent a KIA SOUL. I WILL NVR RENT nor PURCHASE this vehicle or any KIA again. I NOW HATE KIAS & EVERYTHING THEY REPRESENT BAR NONE. BUYER BEWARE. Now on to reporting these fools to the authorities because these guys are from the middle east & are infiltrating the country doing their style of business. LIARS & CHEATS THE WHOLE LOT.",1.0
2,"July 20, 2019","This past Tuesday I purchased my second Kia from your dealership. Chris Vinson is an old friend of mine and he's been my salesman both times. Both experiences I've had were hassle free. I went from a Soul to a Cadenza (talk about an upgrade!). I was in-and-out of finance in under 10 minutes. Not only am I a Kia fan for life, I am a Patterson customer for life. I highly recommend this dealership even if you don't want a used Kia. they have a nice used inventory of different brands to suit your needs.

3,"July 08, 2019","If I could give zero stars I would. Before I get out of my car I check to make sure certain items are still there before locking my vehicle and walking away.
Everything went great up until it was time to get my car. I went in for a scheduled oil change appointment at 2pm on 7/5. I was told it would take an hour to an hour and a half for them to complete my car. I requested for a ride back to work since I was on my lunch. 4pm comes around and I have not received an update on my vehicle. So I reach out to the advisor Tim Barnes that was working with me. He tells me they ended up having to do a warranty reprogram to my ECM software on my car and then gives me a list of items that also need to be done to my car. I end up getting my car back at 4:45 pm. I get into my vehicle and before driving off I check my center console and my personal item is no longer where it was left at drop off! Now again I went in for an oil change nothing else, there was no reason for anyone to look or get into my center console. I addressed the issue with the service advisor Tim and the first thing he says to me is ""well we don't have any theft issues around here"" and that the gentleman who worked on my car was already gone for the day, imagine that! Well obviously they do have a theft issue otherwise my personal item wouldn't be missing from my vehicle! He requests that I wait here, while waiting for him to return I go through my vehicle just to make sure they didn't put it somewhere else. He comes back with the Service Department Director Jason Conley, who was very unfriendly and tried to make it seem like I was lying. He and another gentleman start searching through my car even after I told him I had already checked the vehicle, once again making me seem like a liar. 
The director Jason tells me he will be back. I sit there waiting for at least 20 minutes before I just go inside looking for him (Jason). The director Jason comes around the corner in the office and tells me ""we have searched all the techs tools boxes and the detail bay, your item is not here."" I tell him it doesn't just get up and walk away or vanish like that. I remind him that I was told the guy who worked on my car is already gone for the day, so what about him? He states that he checked his tool box as well and called him about it then says ""he doesn't have it"". He also proceeded to tell me that he knows this guy very well and his father is a priest. I don't care who his dad is or how good of a person he is, someone stole this personal items from my car and it needs to be handled accordingly. Then once again he tells me the item is not there and he doesn't know what to tell me, this will be the 3rd time he has tried to make it seem like I was lying.
I informed him I would be making police report that this is a very serious matter. I went back to my car made a report and waited for the police to arrive. The investigation is still on going with the police. ",1.0
4,"July 07, 2019","My wife and I were looking for a specific preowned pick-up online. We found it at Patterson Kia in Arlington. Debbie took our call and set us up to test drive the pristine condition loaded GMC Denali truck with our sales rep Brandy. She gave us a deal on our trade-in and sent us to Kyle to set up financing. He set us up with a 100k GMC bumper to bumper warranty extension and oil changes. Now I have the excellent lumbar support for my bad back and the truck of my dreams. Thanks for a most positive and rewarding car buying experience Patterson Kia! (Mike G - Midlothian, TX 7/4/19)",5.0
5,"July 06, 2019","My wife purchased a Kia Optima from here years ago.   She was so happy with this dealership!  I am self employed and working seven days a week.   I went to a local dealer and explained my situation.   They were very nice.   I told them I wanted their best deal and I did not have time for back and forth.   I told them about my wife's purchase from Patterson Kia and would give them a chance again.   I called Patterson and spoke with Clinton,  he beat the local dealers 2019 with a 2020.  Then when Clinton realized that I was buying the new Kia for my Mum,  who is 72 years old he told me he would personally deliver the vehicle to her to keep her from driving several hours.   I can not say enough about Clinton and Patterson Kia!  Thank you Clinton and Patterson,  Griff ",5.0
6,"June 07, 2019", Inquired about a Kia soul and got a callback from Frank Ivans He basically said anything he could to get me in to the dealership and then was pushy and aggressive with his sales tactics. Avoid this Dealership and Frank at all costs,1.6
7,"May 06, 2019","This is my third purchase from this dealership and by far it was the most pleasant.  They presented me with some disturbing news about my 2018 Optima trade in, but worked with me to get the best outcome I could.  The service was great from my salesman, Rafael Gaona, the floor manager and the Finance officer.  Very fast and efficient.
Will definitely recommend this dealership to others. ",5.0

9,"April 14, 2019","I did not read any of the reviews about this dealership before driving from Conroe, Texas to Arlington, Texas to see about purchasing a used 2018 Kia Candenza and trading in my 2016 Kia Sedona.  It was probably one of my better experiences in buying a used vehicle - and I'm 74 years old so I have experience at buying used cars.  Of course, after the test drive we sat down to discuss price.  Yes, there were a few hiccups in the beginning but time worked everything out and over all I was pleasantly surprised at how friendly and understanding and willing to work with me they all were.  My salesman, Faisel Hossain and all the managers did a great job making sure that all went well.  Yes the almost 300 mile drive was worth it.",5.0

14,"November 02, 2018",The managers weren't bad. The recptionists were kind and cordial. The mechanics are happy to leave a job half finished. Pete the service advisor was terrible. You better know your car before taking it in for service. Use anyone but him.,2.8
15,"October 27, 2018","Purchased new 2019 Kia Soul had preapproved financing with set rate. Found car I wanted online my sales consultant Anthony has been awesome but here the story takes a different turn. Financing paperwork noticed they had found a different lender than I requested supposedly to give me a better rate. Signed all documentation in good faith. No where did it state upon lender approval signed dated done deal. Received call one week later to resign my paperwork because lender “came back with different terms?!?! Not only did I now have terms from my original lender but at 72 instead of 78 months. The financing officer assured that it was only x $ more per month but he had to beg my original preapproved provider to get the interest rate. Funny it was the same rate they sent from day one???? I have never heard of anything like this!!! After purchase VIP care nooooooo! I am trying to find running boards to assist entry due to my age and health status. SOL. When searching I found item for up to 2016 model. Trying to confirm if these could be used and/or adapted to the 2019 model. One would think since these are Kia manufactured products I could get a reasonable answer from Kia no.
Contacted Kia customer service what little information obtained useless incorrect. Buyer beware when it looks to good it probably it probably isn’t. Sad I like the car but am so disappointed. Not finished yet still searching someone is going to give me approximate answers even if I have to contact Kia in Korea",2.0

18,"January 30, 2018","I bought a used car from Patterson Kia of Arlington, and they had put new tires on it.  Later on, I discovered they had put the wrong size tires on it, and so now when I have an issue with just one tire, I am being forced to purchase an entire new set.  Patterson will not make it right either.  If they really cared about their customers like ""family"" so they claim, they would do what is right and put the correct size on my car. Besides the replacement issue, since I have tires on my car that are smaller than the manufacturer specification, my speedometer and my odometer are incorrect.  Shame on you, Patterson Kia!!!",1.0
19,"November 14, 2017",My family and I have been Patterson Kia customers for years. We've always had excellent service there and have bought several vehicles from there because of that. We have also often referred friends because of the service. ,5.0
20,"August 31, 2017","READ this before you even step foot on this dealer lot!! My daughter who is a single mom of a 4 year old boy had been looking for a used car for a few weeks and we chose a Saturday that we were both free which is very rare these days. So on Saturday February 25th we hit the road to look at cars. We visited 2 other dealerships before we landed at Patterson Kia in Arlington, TX. We looked at 3 different small SUV’s that were in her budget and she narrowed it down to two. We pulled them side by side and compared them and in my mind it was a no brainer. Pick the one with the lower mileage and the 10yr/100k warranty. She agreed and we went inside with the salesman to start the paperwork. As we are sitting down filling out all of the paperwork the salesman is called over to the manager’s office. He walks back and says “I’m sorry but the couple that was here looking at the car before you CALLED back and said they want the car. Mind you, we are already doing the paperwork to purchase it and they “called” and said they wanted it. I was not happy and ready to walk out. My daughter on the other hand was tired of looking and it was late so she opted to go with the other SUV that she had been looking at earlier. At this point, I ask the salesman if they would match the warranty that was on the Kia to the Hyundai that we purchased. He spoke with the manager and came back and said they would do that since they sold the other car out from under us. Needless to say we go through the rest of the buying process and while we are sitting with the finance person I ask about the warranty and he said they do not have a “free” warranty but they will sell us one. He then proceeds to put on the pressure to sale the warranty which would push the payments above her budget. Again, I’m ready to walk out but my daughter says no. This is when the fatherly side of me should have taken control but didn’t. This was around 9:30pm on Saturday and I had a flight to catch the next morning so we finish the paperwork and we leave. The next day I thought more about what had happened and felt anger just take over. I felt taken advantage of and cheated and lied to and we let it happen. I could have easily got up and walked out but she needed the car. They knew this and they also knew they were not selling just one car but two so why do anything for us. First of all, why would they choose to sell to someone that “called back” when I’m right there doing the paperwork to purchase? Then, why lie to me and say they will match the warranty and then pretend like they had no idea what I was talking about? I’ve purchased many cars and have never been treated like this before. I will say that RJ the salesman was no part of this and was very pleasant to work with. He even bought us dinner. But unfortunately, after this experience I will never purchase another car from this dealership. I wish we had walked out and taken our money somewhere else but it’s too late at this point. ",1.0
21,"August 04, 2017",We have purchased three vehicles from Patterson Kia. The last one we purchased for our 18 year old daughter. We worked with Cody Reyna. And he went above and beyond looking for just the right car for our daughter. I would highly recommend him to anyone! He was a delight to work with! D. LaFond,4.8
22,"July 16, 2017","I purchased a car from them 2 years ago and yesterday I saw a car that was advertised on their website that I was interested in.  However, when I got there, there was a big mix up and misunderstanding.  The long story short is that to make up for the misunderstanding they went above and beyond, took a loss on another car, just to make sure we were happy.  Hats off to them, because you never see businesses bend over backward for their customers anymore.  Enough to say that I will always be returning to them when I need a new car. Thank you Patterson (Kevin and his team!!)",5.0
23,"May 02, 2017","The only thing they didn't do was throw my keys on the roof. Stall tactics. Withholding of rebates. Ran my credit EIGHT times!!! Then to throw more gas on the fire, They took a deal we had reached for $288 a month and when my wife and daughter went up there the next day to sign the papers, Ramrodded, humiliated, and generally wore down my wife. They made her feel ignorant, and she is not. They talked down to her, the main offender being a finance guy named, Edwin Pineda. When he was done with my loved ones, the price was THREE HUNDRED NINETY NINE DOLLARS A MONTH!! l Long story short, I went up there, and they fixed the deal back like it was originally agreed upon. I won't waste time calling them all names, but based on my experience, Patterson Kia is the worst car buying experience I've had in 44 years of buying cars. And in that time I've bought LOTS of cars. Oh, and they fired the only decent person we dealt with during this ordeal, Thomas Whitehead, cause he wouldn't work their slave hours. Thomas, holla, I have 2 more cars to buy, soon!

25,"April 21, 2017","I received a call from Thomas Whitehead about trading in my 2015 Optima for a newer model vehicle.

He was able to get me all I wanted into my new Kia that I did not receive from my prior experience and even more. Thomas has kept me informed with all Kia has going on and has been Extremely helpful. I can truly say, that if he was not there and Charles (sales manager), I would not have lease a new vehicle. Overall EXCELLENT experience!!!",4.6
26,"April 21, 2017","This is my third new vehicle purchase from Patterson KIA in Arlington, TX. I like the dealership because of its people and its outstanding customer service.

For instance, my salesperson was Kenneth Eborka. He approached me in the maintenance bay after I had had an oil change and an alignment done, and was about to leave in my 2015 KIA Sportage. He asked if that was my car, and I said yes. He asked if I liked it. I said, uh, yes. He said come and let me show you something that will wow you. I had a few minutes, but did not have any intention of buying a car that afternoon. So I went with Kenneth into the showroom and was indeed wowed! The 2017 model Sportage is gorgeous! We had to go take a test drive, just because. I fell in love with it! He is good at what he does, let me tell you.

Everyone I dealt with that day, from Jarrid Vinson, Assistant Service Manager, to Kevin Polite, New Car Director, to Robert Hall, Finance Manager, and of course, Kenneth Eborka, salesman extraordinaire, was kind, thoughtful, helpful, patient, and very professional. The whole process was smooth, orderly, not rushed or harried; just comfortable and, again, professional. Very impressive!",5.0

Thomas got her a balloon some snacks and put a video on his phone for her to watch and that was a wrap I knew I was buying your car that day.

I have purchased many new cars and trucks since 1985, Thomas gave the best presentation I had ever experienced. He knew every feature on the Sportage and not once looked at the book or even said I'm not sure. He knew the vehicle. That sold me and my wife.

49,"February 27, 2016","I brought a 2015 kia optima 1-30-2016.  I really was interested in a Suv.  However, I was convinced to by the optima and I did. 1st issue- I was told I offered 16k for my mazda cx5 then came the day of deal they told me it was 1500. 2nd- I  was in this store all day and was late for an event that I had to go to that night.  So yes I was tired and in a rush to get the deal over with and I feel like that is why I got such a bad deal!.  3rd. After a week or so of driving the optima I realized I really don't like this car n I do not feel safe in it.  Too low and feels like you will get out of control is u go over a small bump too fast!..so I went back to dealer to see if I could exchange the car for a suv.  N of course I was told they would only give me 20,000 for the week old car when they just sold it to me for 30,000 and yes this includes all the money I was negative on other car! Once again took me thru hours of looking for a suv know full well they were not willing to help me!  Also during this time I asked why hasn't My car been paid off.  I was told sometimes credit unions takes longer and it should be paid off n few days.  3rd... on 1-27 called back to kia asked them why my car I traded in has not been paid... I was told by 1st person that the check was sent on the 23, and while he had me on the phone I could hear him talking to others n I heard them say that this is the one they were having trouble financing or something like that. .. so then I tell him I just called that day n the bank has not received a check.  This man tells me in his smart tone that he will email me a copy of the check and if my bank hasn't got it it wasn't there(kia dealer) problem.  Kia supposedly sent the check period.  My whole issue is I feel like I should not have brought a car frm here n the first place and I am in worse off situation than before I went to this dealership.  Salesmen were nice.  Bit don't feel like customer best interest was there!  Lot of BS excuse in my experience ",1.4

I was talking to my dad about this and he said ""the young man next door sells Kia's"", so I went over at 7:30pm and knocked on his door (did I mention he was eating dinner). I explained my situation and Daniel Williams welcomed me in. He got on line with the dealership and there it was. A white Soul with manual tranny, just exactly what I wanted. He tagged it for me and explained pricing and possible discounts. 2 days later I was at the dealership driving away in the last white Soul, manual tranny, in inventory. 
Daniel went so far out of his way to get me this deal, that I lost sight of him a few times. I could not be more satisfied, and anytime someone asks me where to by a car, I tell them, ""go see Daniel Williams at Patterson Kia of Arlington"". You will not get better service anywhere else. ",5.0

We chose a Honda CR-V and even had a favourite color

I contacted Chris Vinson via a referral, sent him a couple of texts and made 1 phone call

You can imagine my surprise when Chris not only found the vehicle but it was also the exact color

I already had the financing arranged and happy about our interest rate when Chris asked about it
I only told him as I thought it was great but he told me he could do even better

We went in to sign paperwork and never had bought a car with such ease

Ryan and Clinton combined their efforts to ensure we had minimum wait time at a very busy facility. This place runs like a well oiled machine.  Every phase of the buying process went smoothly, and best of all, I genuinely believe we got an exceptional price for a lot of quality vehicle. I was astonished that we didn't have to stress out negotiating to reach a number I already had in mind, via tools available on the internet. 
Clinton treated my mother with utmost respect and patience in going over every detail of the car she purchased. It was a pleasure to watch a young person interact with a such sensitivity to someone a couple or three generations older. But if it's energy you want, they have that, too.

After getting through a few minor ""let's get acquainted"" problems I drove to the dealership and talked to the internet manager Brent Weddle who then introduced me to one of the sales associates Preston Jenkins. We had already decided on a particular car/color and Preston and I headed out for a test drive. I hadn't bought a new car in a while so I was a bit overwhelmed with all the electronic features that came with the car. Even the base models are loaded with lots of electronic features that most of the younger generation will appreciate. Looks like I'll be spending some time with the owner's manual! This car has lots of ""standard"" features including a 2.4 liter engine that develops 190 horse power. Very few other brands could come close to an engine with that much HP as standard equipment. The car has what seems like a very nice stereo and I was quite pleased to see that it came with a 3 month paid subscription to Sirius XM which I will definitely keep. I would have appreciated an adjustable lumbar support for the driver but that's about the only thing I could find to ""nit pick"" about. I've owned 9 Toyotas so stepping outside that Brand was a big step for me. However, the quality of the Sorento and it's many standard features for the price was too hard to pass up.

He fixed that, then misfigured the sales tax. he fixed that, then added 200 dollars for a ""theft protection plan"" that I did not ask for or want. He finally fixed that and took my $6000 check and we were ready to go! But they needed to install splash guards and a spare tire/jack in the car. They were to call me in a day or two when it was ready to pick up. After waiting four days, I called them. They said they had to wait for splash guards to come from Kia. I called another dealer who had them in stock, and asked Patterson why they could not get them from this other dealer??? So, after a full week, they texted me that the splash guards were installed but now they had to wait for a spare tire/jack to come form Kia! 
I called the GM, who was not there and was transferred to Dennis, supposedly the sales manager, who somehow found a spare tire/jack and had them put in the car! Amazing!
So we arrived to pick up our new car, and after waiting, waiting, and waiting, another guy came out and told me that they had not deposited my $6000 check and they wanted me to sign a new contract for the car. Them not depositing the check was the first red flag, a new contract, after the hassle the first time, was the second red flag, so I took my $6000 back from them and left. 
There is just something about this dealership that simply does not pass the smell test. From the sneaky extra charges on the contracts that I caught, to the not wanting to install the extras on the car so I could pick it up, to them wanting to start over when I was there to get the car, it simply does not smell right.

The car that I drove 28-miles from work to see came out $976 higher than the price advertised on the Patterson Kia web site. The sales rep. (Boyd Barrow) said that this was due to dealer add-ons that were excluded from the advertised price (heavens knows why, the customer pays it). I pointed out that this fact was not disclosed. He showed me part of his version of the car's online listing where it was disclosed. I showed him the Patterson Kia web site on my phone -- where that disclosure was missing. He fiddled with the phone version of the web site. Not able to find the disclosure, he said that he would check with his manager. 

After five minutes wait (one of many long waits that I was subjected to at the dealership) I walked over to the manager's office to find out what the delay was (I had been in the dealership over an hour at this point and had a 27-mile journey home). As I approached, he looked up and I said calmly, but matter-of-factly, ""your advertising is misleading. Those add-ons are not disclosed"". 

Before he could respond, a character that I had not noticed (or spoken to) sitting in the corner of the office shot up out of his seat, stormed towards me and stared at me (got in-my-face, to use the idiom). ""If you had bothered to read the web site you would have seen that that was fully disclosed"". I got over the surprise and concern that he was about to hit me and replied calmly. No it's not, I said, and he (referring to the salesman I had dealt with me who was standing next to me in the office) could not find it either. 

The manager spoke up. He confirmed what I had said with the words ""there's a glitch in the mobile web site"". I pointed out to angry-man that he should check his facts before contradicting a customer (maybe he thinks customers aren't worth that effort). Instead of the apology that I expected after my version of the facts had been borne out by his own colleagues, he just became more abusive, shouting ""You're not welcome here!"" The salesman and his manager were silent, but I could see that they could scarcely conceal their embarrassment. Fine I said, I'm leaving.

As I left I made a note of his name, Charles Forbes. He said he was the ""sales guy"" (which translates, on Patterson's web site, to Sales Director). Just for good measure he added ""Try to get me fired?"". He was obviously very comfortable that his bosses endorsed his attitude and language.

I find it unbelievable that such a belligerent, abusive, ill-mannered and all-around screwed-up human being (who cannot even check his facts and admit when he is wrong) should be given such a prominent, customer-facing sales position. It speaks volumes about the kind of values that pervade the dealership and the Patterson approach to business. His final comment indicates how firmly he thinks they endorse it.

The Patterson web site says ""experience the Patterson difference"". Unless you want to deal with abuse and false and misleading advertising I recommend you don't. Kia buyers have plenty of dealer choices elsewhere. 


POSTSCRIPT
The above text was e-mailed to Harry Patterson for comment. He replied the same day (June 11th), saying:

Dear Mr. Chalk,
 
Thanks for bringing these matters to my attention.  Joe Johnson, General Manger/Partner will be in contact with you about your experience.
 
Sincerely,
 
Harry Patterson

Joe Johnson wrote back a few hours later saying that he was on vacation that week but would be back in the office on Saturday. At that time he would complete his due diligence and be in contact with me. 

He returned to the office on June 14th. As of June 23rd I have heard nothing.

108,"June 20, 2014","My husband and I are new buyers so we new that trying to get a car would be difficult or frustrating. We did not expect the mess we have been through already. First person we speak to is Tom D. online. we get to the dealership and are put with Wynn N. who automatically assumed my husband would be the one to answer all the questions and the one to do most of the talking. Mistake number one. Don't be sexist. We are then promised that they can find us a Kia car within our payment range. This takes a few days. We are finally called and told they have a car for us. I go check it out and happen to be assisted by 2 other people, Edwin and Kenneth. (Edwin seems nice.) Now I have a thing about smacking gum while having a conversation so I politely asked Kenneth to not do so while he was talking with us. He gets mad and proceeds to tell me "" you know what I will get you someone you can work with, I don't like you"" a little while later he comes back. I am sitting at a desk with my friend and sister. Kenneth then leans down, hands on table, opens his mouth and breaths all over our faces, and then asked if that's better. This pissed me off so much that I ended up with an anxiety attack. Major issue there. I then ask to speak to the head person in charge and I am directed to Dennis Michael who apologizes but doesn't offer any other type of help. I then get a hold of Joe Johnson and once again he apologizes but no further action to help me is taken. I am then told that Kenneth is a GREAT employee... Excuse me but I do not care how good his track record is. He could be the best sales person on the earth. He is no longer a GREAT employee once he pulls a stunt like he did. To sum this up. I dealt with 6 different people, was treated horrible, and to my standards 2 of the men I dealt with are sexist.",1.6
109,"May 03, 2014",Brought my 72 year old grandmother for a soul! I had negotiated the price (actually the same price that was on cars.com).  Salesman was on vacation even after making an appt with me and after an hour and a half they told me the price was last months price and it had increased 2k. Left and went to Moritz where we got the same car same features for the price that Patterson originally quoted me AND posted online.  Stay away from this dealership that clearly lies and does bait and switch. ,1.0
110,"April 29, 2014","If you are longing for the days of parachute pants, Devo and car dealerships not having to worry about the free exchange of information, you have found the place for you!  You might have thought that the days of cars advertised at a price the dealership had no intention of selling them for, a back room meeting every time you ask a question, false promises and inflated prices when you get to financing were gone for good.  Well rest easy, they are alive and well at Patterson Kia.  
I'll admit, I was a little bored when I bought my wife's care across the street at Vandergriff.  They simply put the advertised price on a piece of paper, added TTL to it and told me that it could not be beat. They were right!
All of that boredom was relieved with my two day experience at Patterson.  I have dug out my denim jacket, unpacked my Huey Lewis cassettes and relived car buying as it was 30 years ago.  For the full experience, ask for Robert and Brent, I think I get some sort of referral for sending you to them. :-)

111,"April 04, 2014","Bought a 2007 chevy truck. With in a week we had to add one quart of oil, another week went by and added another quart of oil, then low oil light came on again on the third week. Took truck back to get another and was told they could but I would lose my 7 thousand dollars that I put down. The truck had both head gaskets blown and now they are tearing down the engine to replace the pistons and rings and other things. Would you want to do business we these people who said the vehicle was perfect when sitting on the lot.",2.4
112,"March 15, 2014","Had a very nice experience with these guys.  Got a great deal on a new Kia Rio, which I traded in my 08 Rio for, and the process was seamless.  We went back a week later and traded in my wife's 08 Sorento for a 2013.  We will definitely be back when we are ready to buy again, and use these guys for our service needs, which should be few, and maintenance.  Mike is a solid, honest, and nice guy.  We worked with Dub and Jeremy both times and they got us fantastic rates on both vehicles.",5.0
113,"March 15, 2014","Mike was great to work with - very nice and helpful.  I forgot my floor mats in my trade-in, and he got me new ones to fit my newer Kia Sorento.  The process was smooth, and everyone did whatever they could to make sure I was happy.  ",5.0
114,"February 18, 2014","I flew from Los Angeles, CA to see the car based on the conversation with Used car manager Dennis. The truck had lots of problems none of which have been advertised. Few images with low resolution with no advertised price (obviously to get you in and use their techniques) The truck has wrong tires on making a huge humming noise. Seats were cracked. The trick was dirty, lot of rust. They kept saying they will fix it. How you going to fix the rust? I don't recommend buying at least used car. 

More importantly although most of their sales people I came in contact were very friendly specially Quyen, this place has a terrible used car manager apparently known as Dennis. In short he is arrogant and rude. Don't know why but I believe he kept saying he is too much into the car and can't let it go for less??? If he can't manage inventory, have attitude with customer, he should look for another job. This is not his cup of tea. 

I think I knew what I wanted, I would have even paid for discounted price he told me ($2500 less than what he was originally asking) but I left because of his attitude. Ended up buying a 2008 Hummer (their was 2007) much cleaner than their with $1000 more from BBC sportmotors. The whole transaction with BBC took less than an hour but they were friendly. Feel really sad for those who have to work with Dennis. I would fire him just to have a nice working environment for my employees and customer.    ",1.8
115,"February 13, 2014","I've worked with Patterson Kia for over three years and have referred a ton of friends to them, all of whom are very happy with their purchases (including my MIL!). I purchased a used car from Patterson Kia in January and we have been thrilled with it as well. 

The service department is great, the internet department is extremely helpful, and the salespeople can sell both new AND used cars - so no hand-off to someone else in a different building or location if you decide to cross over. The dealership is a little tough to get to - you have to loop around Interstate 20, but it is worth that small hassle.",5.0
116,"September 12, 2013",I don't know if it was the car we bought or what but it has been in the shop A LOT for a new car. We bought the Kia Sedona. We paid it off recently and now it's back in the shop. Has low mileage for an 2008. It has been there for several days and the service department can not give us a time frame as to when we will get our car back. I have called them more than they have called me. I asked if they gave a loaner car seeing as how they have my only family car and I have three children to get to school and a two seat truck but they have yet to get back to me on that. Very frustrated that it is taking so long and no feedback is being given. I would be content if I had a way to drive my family to and from the places we need to be at in a car that could take us all. ,2.7
117,"May 28, 2013","My wife and I brought her Kia in this past weekend for the 75k service.  We've been using Patterson Kia for quite some time, since the 15k service.

In that time, she has had no issues with her '08 Kia Sportage, til now.  Recently, the driver side rear brake started making noise.  At her request, I came with her to explain the noise in hopes that it would be investigated during the 75k service.

At drop off, I explained to the service rep that the driver side rear break was making noise. That the noise was very erratic and that it was making the sound a drum brake makes when they're sticking.

At around 9:20am, the service rep called my wife to inform her the rear brake pads were at 25%, and that most likely it was the wear indicator creating the noise.  He also stated that they didn’t know for sure if this was the noise, because the wear indicator is on the back side of the rotor.  My wife called me to relay the information, and I told her to pass on the $200 brake service.  Immediately, two red flags came up.  The first flag being that this type of noise would NOT be that erratic, and the second being that being that wear indicator noise is NOT what I described to the service rep.

Later that afternoon, I removed the driver side rear tire, and checked the pads myself.  The rear pad had approximately 50 thousandths left before the wear indicator would hit the rotor.  Then, while the brake caliper was removed and the parking brake was released, I checked the hub to verify free rotation without resistance.  It failed, and all at once everything made sense.  It sounded like a drum brake sticking, because it WAS a drum brake sticking!  The culprit was the driver side rear parking brake sticking.   Also, I verified this against the passenger side rear which spun freely.

I also discovered that Patterson Kia had rotated the tires incorrectly.  The tires are directional and had been rotated front to back diagonally.

There is a severe lack of attention to detail in Patterson Kia's service department, and I advise anyone to proceed with caution with anything other than simple routine maintenance!

118,"February 19, 2013","I used their website to ""check availability"" of one of the models I was interested in on a Sunday night. I never received a response and finally had to call the dealership around noon the next day to see if the model was available. I scheduled a test drive of the vehicle with Steve Potter and noticed immediately the high pressure sales tactics -- we need to make a sale today, blah, blah, blah, we'll bend over backward for your business. 

Arriving at the dealership, I was greeted by Jared Vinson who would act as my salesman to begin working the deal and handling the test drive. I was looking at a used car they had on their lot priced about $1,000 below their competitors. This should have been a warning flag. There was nothing mechanically wrong with the vehicle, but it was obvious that it has been run over a couple of curbs at some point during it's lifetime as there was noticeable scuffing and scratching on both of the front wheel covers. Also, inspecting the car revealed there was no owners manual, no floor mats, the jack was left loose in the back of the vehicle (which was very noticeable during turns on the test drive) and the vehicle remote appeared to be missing. 

I was still interested in the car, but noting these issues I figured I would have some really good bargaining power. After all, they need a sale today, right? 

The salesman sat down with the all too familiar 4-square and put down the price of the vehicle in the top left (minus TTL, of course, keep those costs hidden until the end), the value of my trade in the top right and then proceeded to ask me my desired monthly payment. The initial numbers returned at just over $10 above my payment. My first question was would they take $1,500 off the price of the vehicle due to the damage observed to the front wheels and the missing items (or a savings of about $40 per month). The immediate answer from Jared was, ""They might take $100 or $200 off, but it's really rare. This is the internet price and we don't go back and forth over the posted price.""

I should have walked out right then -- I have never paid the ""full"" price of a vehicle listed on a website. I just purchased another vehicle from another dealer for $3000 under the ""Internet Price"". 

So my next turn was to get them to offer more for my trade -- this is when Jared returned with Steve Potter who said they are already loosing money on the valuation of my trade -- my thought, why did you offer so much in the first place? 

I know better. The KBB wholesale price was a full $1,000 over their offer price and a quick search over the internet shows that many dealers were selling my exact model for at least $2,500 over their offer. 

After sitting there for around 2 hours, I walked out of the dealership over $10 a month -- just $500 difference in the vehicle. I know if they had really been interested in my business they would have worked on that difference. I have no plans to return. The funny thing is, I have run their numbers MULTIPLE times on MULTIPLE loan calculators and never noticed the $10 difference they were posting, so who knows what hidden fees they weren't telling me about!

122,"July 06, 2012","A couple months ago I was in the market to replace my totaled Corolla with an Avalon. Patterson Kia listed an Avalon on their website and was in my price range. I scheduled a test drive but ended up showing up to the dealership 2 days prior. Mainly because Avalons in the area do not sit around the lots much. They are hot sellers. Before we met I explained to Tom regarding a situation that happened years ago which left me leery on bumper damage and other hidden damages. He knew exactly how I felt with cosmetic evidence showing that there has been some sort of trauma to the vehicle regardless of severity. I drove to the lot and spoke with Tom. When we met he had one of his guys go get the vehicle in the lot and drive it up to the building for us. That was nice that we did not have to walk across the hot lot searching for a car. But when he immediately pulled up I could tell that both bumpers had damage to them. Not knowing what other damage was behind the bumpers i quickly declined to test drive the vehicle. Both Tom and the other guy looked at me like I was the dumbest person ever for wasting their time. That upset me and my attitude changed immediately to react to their unwelcome hospitality. I knew they had a Camry on the lot and I just wanted to see it for comparison to the Avalon. Not to buy but to see the comparison. We walked over and Tom gave me the typical sales pitch, ""This car is much better for you."" How does Tom know what vehicle is better for me? I asked him, ""How so?"" Tom replies, ""Because this was our service advisor's mother's old car."" I asked him in return, ""Can your service advisor's mom explain the damage to the bumper on the Camry?"" Tom quickly replied, ""Yes, but she is not here right now."" Both sales guys continued to look at me like I just ruined their entire day. During the encounter Tom even walked around the Camry looking at other cars and he said that out of the 7 cars he just looked at, 7 of them have bumper damage. To find a car without bumper damage was almost impossible these days. Who exactly does this Tom guy think he is? That just proves that their inventory is poor and they don't fix issues before they list the vehicles for sale. I thanked him for his time and walked away. No sale for you. I could feel their stares burning holes in the back of our heads as we walked away. Not a good feeling when a customer walks away frustrated and unhappy with the remarks of the sales staff. 

I would like to add that I found the same exact model of Avalon at Toyota of Plano, which was cheaper than Tom's listing, less miles, 100% delaer maintained, 1 car owner, non-smoker, and had 0 damage to the vehicle. Test drove it the very next day and drove away with my Avalon after paying about 70% cash and financing the rest. The entire process took about 1 hour of my time once at the lot. In and out, deal was done. Patterson Kia you missed out.",1.8
123,"June 21, 2012","The actual sale process was excellent!  They actually act like they will take care of anything you need.  But beware!  Once you sign the papers and drive off the lot, the service quality drops dramatically!!!  Getting anything out of anyone is like pulling teeth.  Overall, it's not worth it.  A good car dealership would back up their customer service claims.  Patterson Kia is not a good dealership.  ",2.3

I live in Connecticut and found out through Kia Customer Affairs that they were to receive a 2012 Kia Soul ! that had all the options I was looking for but could not find on the east coast. Everything I did with Sam was online or by phone. I took a chance and purchased this vehicle sight un-seen. Every detail was completed by Sam or the finance dept in a timely manner.

127,"September 27, 2011","I went to this dealership first when looking to buy my new KIA Optima.  They did not have a new KIA on the lot that met all of my wants, but the GM was driving one that was my color and had all of my features.  The dealership had added tinted windows and a spoiler.  I made the comment that I did not ask for the tint or the spoiler, and asked what kind of deal they would make for the ""used"" car.  The price that was quoted to me was 28,000 plus TTL.  The GM represented to me that this was a deal and that I was not being charged for the extras the dealership decided to put on the car.  When I went to get financing through my bank they would not finance me for the price of the car saying it was not worth that much.  Through a subsequent conversation with another dealer and giving them the VIN number of the car, I was informed that this dealership was not only charging me full price for the car, but also charging me for the extras.

A call to the GM netted me a man who called me a liar saying he never said he was not charging me the extras.  I agreed that he never specifically said that but that he represented in the conversation that I was getting a deal on this car and not being charged for the extra's.

Watch out for this place, they will take you if they feel they can.  I would not recommend this place to anyone, but if you do go please be informed of what you want and what the car is worth.
