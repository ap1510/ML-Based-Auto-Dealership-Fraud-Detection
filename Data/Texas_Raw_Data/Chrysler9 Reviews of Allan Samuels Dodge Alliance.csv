1,"December 31, 2016","I so appreciate the hard work that Alex and the sales team put in for me. Though my credit is challenging, they worked hard to get me into a new vehicle, Jeep Patriot at a reasonable interest rate and low down payment. Thank you again Alex for all of your help!!!! ",4.8
2,"December 27, 2016",I brought my car in because the check engine light was on. Don was excellent in helping me. He provided me with a Christmas Present. He fixed my car for free and was AMAZING!! I am truly grateful. I was able to have my car before Christmas!,4.8
3,"December 04, 2014","Allan Samuels Dodge at Alliance is a joke. The customer service is horrible. The staff can never give you a straight answer. If you need to talk to someone you are better off going up there because your phone call will NEVER be returned. It doesn't matter if you call 20 times in a day. The staff has NO IDEA what they are doing. For example, my husband and I traded in our car for a 2014 Jeep Cherokee. Through this process we went back and fourth with the dealer ship to resign contracts because they kept making errors. On our contract it showed who we were financed through. However we received a letter in the mail from the same bank saying they did not agree to the terms. I then had to drive up to Allan Samuels because like I said no one returned my calls. I was then told to disregard the letter that it was 'normal' yet no one could tell me who to make my payments to. We had this jeep for over 6 weeks with no payments & my old car was past due accumulating late fees. We then received a phone call to return the jeep because they apparently added an extra rebate to my account that wasn't suppose to be there. Which they called me about 3 weeks prior to this and nothing else was said. It was just one big mess. The ONLY thing they did was cut me a check for my past due payment & late fee's which I demanded. Save yourself the headache & time,go to a REAL dealership!!",1.0
4,"July 04, 2013","First and foremost, NEVER buy a vehicle from Alan Samuels Alliance. Jason Scott and Joe Simpson are lying xxxx.

1. Took nearly a week to receive my truck from a another Alan Samuels owned dealership a couple hundred miles away.

2. Received call from Joe Simpson saying that the truck was there and being washed and gassed up. This was a lie. Joe never even looked at the vehicle before it was delivered to me. The vehicle was delivered to me DIRTY, NO GAS (EMPTY), and the TPMS (low tire) light was on.

3. They told me that I could come to take the aftermarket exhaust off of my trade and re-install the factory one. I got there, had the exhaust half way off and Jason Scott came out and told me that I could not do that. He looked me in the eye and promised a $500 check for the aftermarket exhaust that was on my trade. I NEVER RECEIVED IT!!

4. I never received a follow-up call or survey from the dealership to see how things were going with the vehicle. I WONDER WHY?

5. I've since purchased a second new vehicle but it wasn't a Dodge and it darn sure wasn't from Jason Scott and Joe Simpson at Alan Samuels Alliance.

This place is an unprofessional joke that will NEVER get future new car or service business from me or anyone I know.",1.0
5,"June 05, 2013",service deptment service writer did not keep me informed as to why it was taking so long to get our vehicle repaired because we were having to rent a truck to continue our route. The service department said it would be ready by monday the 3rd of June and it wasnt and I had to call them constantly to get updates.We finally got the truck back on wednesday the 5th of june. Very disappointed in the fact that they would not keep me informed about the time frame of repairs.,2.4
6,"June 03, 2013","This is one of the dealers you hear bad stories about, scuzzy lowlife slicksters that only have it out to roll you for every dime you have.",1.0
7,"January 02, 2013","Lied, lied, lied. Kept my car for several weeks to perform a simple repair under warranty. Would actually perform the repair until I proved he was lying in front of other customers. Then while telling a friend of my experience I find out he had a very similar experience with the same service writer. Terrible place and tried to charge me over 800$ for warranty work at 15,000 miles. ",1.0
8,"July 10, 2012","They will sell you a car and be very friendly. Make sure you get everything in writing before you sign the dotted line. No,""oh I will get that done when you bring it back"". Trust me, it will never get done.",2.0
