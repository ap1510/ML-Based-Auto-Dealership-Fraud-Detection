0,"May 06, 2020","We had been searching online for a while for a Yukon Denali XL for our family of 7.  I happened to come across the Holiday website and found ""the car"" that we've been looking for.  We live in the Northeast.  We have not purchased a car from out of state before, let alone halfway across the country.  I was worried that it might be too complicated, especially during a pandemic.  I called and reached Jeramy H.  He was extremely kind to speak with and he was very patient with all of my questions. He was very easy to work with and to get in touch with and he was very responsive.  He made the entire process so easy.  Even during a pandemic we had the car within approximately one week from my first phone call with Jeramy - all the way from Texas!  We were very pleased with the car when it arrived.  The transport went smoothly.  The car was as expected (beautiful!).  The price was right.  Overall, we were very pleased with the transaction and would absolutely do it again!  Thank you to Holiday and to Jeramy for helping us get the vehicle we've been looking for and for making the process so easy.",5.0

2,"February 12, 2020","Great buying experience with the internet sales department. Kraig contacted us immediately, got the paperwork to finance and Peter took care of our financing immediately with a better than expected rate. Kraig even had the documents sent to us to sign.  The whole process was easy and stress free.  Thank you Holiday! ",5.0
3,"September 28, 2019","I was in the market for a new 2020 Silverado HD and began my search online.  After finding a truck I was interested in with what seemed like a great internet price, I inquired online with Holiday Chevrolet and was promptly contacted back by their sales consultant, Greg Betts.  Although Greg's emails were all short and to the point, he confirmed the truck was in stock and answered any and all questions that I had.  After 3 or 4 days of me trying to find a dealer within a 300 mile radius that would beat their price, I went with Greg at Holiday and have absolutely no regrets.  (I even had 2 other dealerships that told me to ""run and buy that truck at that price because they couldn't get close to that deal"".)  The entire staff was friendly and the whole process of test drive, paperwork and truck preparation took just a couple of hours.  Very satisfied and I will definitely shop with Holiday Chevrolet in the future.",5.0
4,"September 06, 2019","I bought a vehicle from Holiday in 2018 and had a good experience. This year (2019) I wanted to buy a truck, and Holiday Chevrolet had great deals on Silverado’s. I found the one I wanted, and got the deal done via text with Kraig. One catch, I live in Houston. Kraigs said no problem and had the truck delivered to my house for a small fee. The next call I get is from the driver Brent and he was extremely polite and professional. Brent confirmed the day and time of delivery and made sure that it worked with my schedule. When Brent and Lee showed up, I inspected the truck with them, signed paperwork, and they were on their way. This by far is the easiest vehicle I have ever bought.

5,"August 20, 2019","I purchased a new truck on 8/19/19 from Holiday Chevrolet.  Prior to the purchase, I contacted the dealer through the website (I live almost 2 hours away from the dealer).  I promptly received a call from JD, inquiring what I was interested in.  After getting that information, I received an email with video of a truck just a few minutes later, detailing the exterior and interior, all done by JD in the few minutes after my call.  He assured me of the sales price, and when I called him back, he gave me the ""out the door"" total with TTL.  No one around could match the deal he gave me, so I couldn't turn down the opportunity to buy.  He got all of my personal information and gave me the next steps to complete the sale.

Later that day, when we arrived, JD had the truck gassed up and waiting out front for us to check out.  Shortly after, we were able to do the paperwork (really it was mostly done electronically).  That process only took about 20 minutes.

I couldn't be happier with my experience.  It was the easiest vehicle purchase I've ever made.  They will be my first call the next time I'm in the market for a new vehicle after this experience!

6,"August 10, 2019","We'd been shopping for a very specific make and model for several weeks and finally found one online. Communication with Kraig Clement was easy, prompt, and above all painless. Felt very comfortable with Kraig from the very first phone call. No spin, no nonsense, just straight up facts and figures. Fast communication. The whole deal was closed over the phone in less than 24 hours. Flew into DFW where Ken, their shuttle driver was waiting to take me to the dealership. Took the car for a ride, came back and met Peter Alvino to do the paperwork and was on my way in less than 30 minutes.There was no sleazy upsell tactics like the last time we purchased a car from the VW dealer in AMA. No vehicle etching scam, no warranties, just sign, write the check an on my way.

So like the title of this review is, if you don't want an awesome smooth experience, go somewhere else, but if you are looking for that rare honest car salesman, contact Kraig!",5.0
7,"July 19, 2019","I found this place on Autotrader and their prices looked very good, but I was skeptical. After reading many positive reviews I figured I would contact them. I dealt with salesman Kraig and we pretty much worked everything out over the phone. I flew into DFW and they picked me up and took me to the dealership and I was in and out in no time and on the road. I had a great experience dealing with Kraig and the driver that picked me up at the airport. I highly recommend you call Kraig if you are looking to buy a new vehicle. This place is legit and is the real deal. Will save you a lot even after paying for travel expenses. Well worth the trip.",5.0

10,"March 23, 2019","Do your home work before showing up at Holiday Chevrolet. I was there today 03/23/19 and spoke with sales consultant Brent Mathews. The dealer provides a calculator on their website www.holidaychevy.net for a lease or finance for each vehicle, providing you payments estimates for each preference. But according to them the LEASE calculator which provides you a much better deal IS NOT WORKING. I did my research before going out there and make sure the numbers were accurate so I would not looks stupid in front of them. They would not provide me with the numbers and not even the information about leasing the vehicle. All they said was ""the number are not good"" and they would not honor the numbers that is on the web site and not even show it to me. Complete wast of time, LIAR, LIAR. I would recommend visiting Stonebriar Chevrolet or any other and see for yourself the difference. I would NOT recommend them to anyone and will file a complain at the BBB. They should not be providing a tool online that is not accurate and just tell that is not working. Why are they allowed to make FALSE ADVERTISEMENT and not be punished or have to remove the Tool from the website. We need to make them responsible for their acts.",1.6

13,"November 29, 2018",I bought a new Ford in 2013 from Holiday Ford.  So when I was looking for a new Chevrolet I thought I would check the website and see if they had what I was looking for.  Sent an inquiry and Nic called me.  The truck I found wasn't what I was looking for but Nic suggested another that was exactly what I needed.  Bonus the price was less.  Made the drive from Oklahoma to test drive and start the paperwork.  Start to finish a great experience.  Right truck right price Thanks Nic.,5.0

Rachel was fantastic! Within an hour of my online inquiry, I had estimates on my 2 trades including a motorcycle. Everything was simple, fast and easy. Everyone was polite and low pressure.

17,"June 17, 2018","I started the purchase of a new truck by looking online at various options and pricing. I am also a repeat customer on buying a new truck from Holiday Auto Group. Salesman David Johnson did an outstanding job. He stayed late to meet my schedule, and was very helpful on explaining the various options and features about the truck. Jared Wisdom did an awesome job explaining all the various forms to complete my trade in and new truck paperwork. I didn't have any high pressure moments which is why I bought this new truck from Holiday Chevrolet. Really appreciate you guys

28,"November 22, 2017","I was pricing new Camaro's with Holiday Chevrolet and several dealerships in Oklahoma.  Ryan Roberts at Holiday gave me a great price on the exact car I wanted, but I was concerned about making the 2 hour drive and then being told I didn't qualify for all the incentives, etc. once I got there.  I actually had a salesman at another dealership tell me there was no way Holiday could sell me that car at the price they quoted, so I was a little hesitant.  Ryan made sure I qualified to get the car at the price he quoted, he put it in writing and followed through with everything we talked about.  It was one of the best car buying experience I've ever had!  David Johnson in the finance department was great too, and patiently answered all my questions even though it was after closing time on a Saturday by the time I got to his office.  I would definitely make the drive to Holiday Chevrolet again and recommend them to my friends and family.  ",5.0

We started looking around and found the same style car at Holiday Chevrolet and contacted Kraig Clement.... Kraig is awesome! We drove several hours from Tulsa to get there but sure glad we did!

57,"October 09, 2016","After 10 years of driving a 1/2 ton truck (that I was still pleased with and did not have to purchase or trade in), I really needed 3/4 ton for my changing needs.  I decided to give all Makes, Models, Types, and Local Dealerships a try. I always buy last years Model to catch rebates, incentives, etc.

After evaluations and test drives, Holiday had the best inventory. And I was fortunate that Dakota Caddell (Sales) selected me as a person that was ""just looking"" that late Thursday evening in October.

So with the Wife (Boss) whom dislikes vehicle purchasing - except for this time - we were at the dealership. Shortly thereafter, we bought and traded in, and within a few hours we were home with the new truck.

63,"August 16, 2016","I hate high pressure salesmen and the blatant gimmicks that some people will use to try and manipulate you into making a huge investment.

Buying a new vehicle has never been easier for me. David Johnson knew the answer to every question I had about my truck, no pressure, no sales gimmicks. David found out why I wanted a truck, found the best one with the options I needed, and made it work within my budget. This was like buying a car from a trusted friend. 

For once, financing a new vehicle was also stress free. Holiday uses a paperless process that made things a lot easier. Jeramy Hansley also knows his stuff and made the entire process easy to understand and very fast.

148,"June 19, 2014","The Service and Communication from the dealership has been VERY POOR since the date of purchase.  I sent 3 days worth of E-mails to the salesman I delt with Kraig Clement and got no response.  So I called and talked to Gregg Hodge (Sales Manager) and he said that just isn't like Kraig to do that.  He has been really busy.  They did not get the check delivered to the License Bureau when they said they would, so i got to waste an hour in line at my local DMV.  I had to wait 3 days to get a call back from the finance department after leaving voice mail messages.  My XM radio quit working, so I E-mialed Gregg and Kraig for 3 days in a row and NO response from either of them.  I asked for 2 hats and Kraig said I would get those.  Still waiting on them to come in, their out.  But they told me to call and remind them to send them.  So nice that I have to call and remind them of something they promised me.  So, luckily I got to deal with Mary (in the title transfer office) and she was fabulous on over nighting the check for the tags.  She was VERY honest and admitted that they dropped the ball on not getting the check delivered on time.  Mary is the only person that has been helpful and straight forward.  Then I was contacted by David Johnson in the Customer Service Department to see about my issues.  Gregg Hodge said he would get back with me, but never did.  David said that ""E-mail wasn't working correctly"" and ""it's the end of the month so the finance office is really busy""  All excuses in my opinion.  I have never heard of any service company being O.K. with a 72 hour or longer turn around on answering E-mails or Voicemail messages.  Maybe by day 4 I will be contacted by someone about the XM radio not working.  I tried the chat option today on the website and the guy said he will turn over the details to the ""team"".  I am very frustrated that when I was looking at buying the Suburban I got my E-mails and phone calls returned within minutes and now that they have my money.  It takes 3 plus days and me having to try and contact 3 different people to get any kind of response.  VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE AFTER THE SALE",2.0

So much so that I had become numb to the experience of working with a dealership and simply expected that wherever I went I would get the run-around and be swindled out of thousands of dollars. I first heard of Holiday Chev.through my insurance USAA. They are partners and my insurance rep. sent them info about the type of car I was looking for. I instantly received an email from them quoting prices that were already competitive with the other dealerships I had worked with. They really fought for my business and earned it. I am glad that I decided to work with them despite their location. I took a leap of faith and used their FREE car delivery system. I did everything over the phone and was thankful that everything worked out when it arrived. They even got me a better interest rate with financing. I have only just begun working with them so there is still more to be determined for the future, but I will say that they made my car buying experience yesterday much easier than I expected! Thank you guys :)",5.0
159,"November 11, 2013",I was overall pleased. I was weary of purchasing a vehicle via tha internet at first but Frank made it easy. I traveled over 300 miles to get a better price for the Traverse I wanted. But it was worth the trip. I will would definatly make the trip all over again if needed again.,4.4
