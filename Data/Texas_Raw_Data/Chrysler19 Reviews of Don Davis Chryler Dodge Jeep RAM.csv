0,"January 21, 2020","Had a really good experience here. Wasn't pressured or had a lot of anxiety, other then our kids distracting us. They were very thorough and familiar with the different features. We bought one but when we got it home decided we really wanted the other vehicle. They made the swap and paper work right then and there. They were professional about it and weren't upset about it. 
Will be returning to get another vehicle in the future. ",5.0

4,"September 16, 2019",This was my first time buying a new vehicle and I have to say it was the easiest and best experience I could have asked for! Joshua Martin was my salesman and he was so knowledgeable and caring with all things I needed. I purchased a 2019 Hyundai Tucson and absolutely love it! I would highly recommend him to anyone in need of a vehicle. There wasn’t a single question I had that he couldn’t answer honestly. ,5.0

6,"July 07, 2019","I went in with pre approval and their finance manager got me a lower rate at another bank , I got a great price for my old car and my salesperson Amber was the best I have ever dealt with!  I was done in about 2 and a half hours, by far the fastest I have ever bought a car!",5.0
7,"May 11, 2019","After visiting several dealerships in the area, I must say Don Davis was the most laid back, helpful, and caring.  Chris took time to answer my questions instead of trying to push a sale.  I felt at home.  The truck I chose was low mileage and beautiful.  I could not be happier.  I can not say the same for other dealerships I went to.  It seemed that since I was paying cash and no trade, most dealers were not interested in negotiating.  That was shocking to me. Not enough profit i guess.  Not so at Don Davis.  They are very customer friendly and handled business in the old fashion way.  Honest, and with integrity ",5.0

9,"November 14, 2018","The only sales incentives offered were those offered by the manufacturer.  Folks are friendly, but they rely on their local presence for sales.  Experience has shown that better deals are offered by large city dealerships.  ",2.3
10,"October 31, 2018","On Saturday Oct 27, 2018 I went to just look and see what was available with No intent of buying anything. I began to look at several trucks and what my options would be. After a bit, I test drove a newer 2019 truck that was way out of price range. After a bit was given the opportunity to view a truck that I liked and wanted when time came. As a result I drove home with a 2019 1500 Dodge Crew Cab   Lonestar Edition. Truck is Beautiful and will enjoy it Immensely. Thank You for your Professionalism.   ",4.6

17,"December 27, 2016","Had a great experience buying a Jeep here! Josh Martin was fantastic and was very helpful and knowledgeable.

18,"April 28, 2012","Met Jordan last month and even though I wasn't able to buy the car at that time, we went on a test drive of a new 300.  I already had a 2009 300C and knew I wanted another Chrysler 300 with the  same amenities that I was already enjoying in my 300C, but wanted the economy of 31 mpg that the new 300's were promising.
He just happened to have the brown 300 that I was looking for (I was also considering a red 300S, whih they didn't have ) and Jordan explained all the extras that the car had, most of which I already had but some new ones.  He's surprisingly knowledgeable about what the extras did and how to work them.
This is suposed to be my last car,  as was the 300C, but if I'm still in the market in 3 more years,  I'll probably be back. 
I'm finding the new 300 Limited to be all that I  expected and still have no buyers remorse about buying an expensive wonderful car.  I was very satisfied with my  2009 and expect to be the same, if not more pleased, with the new 2012 Limited.",4.8
