2,62,28-Nov-15," Started out by quoting a higher price with a higher interest rate even though we came in with our own financing at a much lower rate. Only dropped their price once we receive the call from a competing dealership for a lower price. Even after we agreed on price, trade in and down payment they still try to finagle a higher number in financing. They'd already swipe our card for down payment and took our check to hold for 3 days and made it hard on us to get that number changed. The check that was supposed to be held for 3 days was deposited next day causing overdraft fees in our account. Two weeks later we're still waiting for refund and paperwork on vehicle transaction and no one is calling us back. Also, salesman had us do Google review in front of him before car was delivered to us pressuring for a 5 star review. It makes me wonder how many of their 5 star reviews are really accurate. If they do this with all customers.....",1,started out by quoting a higher price with a higher interest rate even though we came in with our own financing at a much lower rate only dropped their price once we receive the call from a competing dealership for a lower price even after we agreed on price trade in and down payment they still try to finagle a higher number in financing theyd already swipe our card for down payment and took our check to hold for days and made it hard on us to get that number changed the check that was supposed to be held for days was deposited next day causing overdraft fees in our account two weeks later were still waiting for refund and paperwork on vehicle transaction and no one is calling us back also salesman had us do google review in front of him before car was delivered to us pressuring for a star review it makes me wonder how many of their star reviews are really accurate if they do this with all customers,1
4,91,05-Jan-15,"I bought a used vehicle from Mac Churchill and had multiple major issues with the process. Besides not receiving any documentation on the bumper to bumper warranty (even when directly asking), them not honoring a WE OWE for major repairs and failing to cancel my maintenance contract when they repeatedly said they would; The biggest issue is that they inflated the negotiated base sales of the vehicle by $1,500.00 on the sales contract and they lied when directly asking about it. Paul Garrett said there are ""fees rolled into the back-end"". I signed the contract and later found out this is completely false and they flat out jacked the price out on me. When I called their bluff and provided evidence to show they blatantly increased the price, they made up a new contract and said they would submit it to my lender. I went in on several occasions over the next few months and talked with many different finance reps including the assistant finance director Ali. All of them promised the second contract was sent to the lender. After 3 months of demanding why they have not made good on their promise and why my lender still reflected the inflated amount, I finally got to sit down with the Finance director Ray. Ray admitted that they had not sent in the second contract and that there was ""nothing he could do because it was too late"". These guys flat out committed fraud, lied to brush me off and are not offering a resolution. If you want my opinion.... DO NOT BUY FROM HERE!!

434,167,08-Jul-11,"The thought of buying my first car was exciting until I ended up getting taken advantage of by their salesman. The salesman guaranteed the car himself and for Mac and said the car had been inspected and there were no problems, I made it clear that me and my baby would be in this car all the time so it needed to be safe. He knew I didn't know much about fixing or even buying cars and so I end up getting stuck with an 02 MDX that has wharped rotors, the rear a/c won't blow and things seem to fall off randomly (a/c vents, rear view mirror, etc...) Onay was so persistent in selling this car to me that he had my husband cosign without being there  OR signing papers. I didn't even have insurance for the vehicle! Now the bank calls me and tells me I neeed full coverage not liability and once again I'm a first time buyer, he knew that and didn't tell me...Now my loan is not finalized and I had a trade in w/ down payment.

442,176,26-Nov-19,"Very bad dealership. Not happy with them at all.
I bought a car from them, the car had some damage in the hood and bumper. It was showing nothing in the CarFax report which was really strange.

Business usually run on trust, my biggest mistake was trusting them.

They made me test drive a different car claiming that my car would have the exact same feature, which it did not.
They made me wait for a month to get the car(told me it would take a week to fix it), made me sign the contract for the car before the car was fixed and also said that my 5 car trial period would start after my car was fixed and I get my car.
Since my car didn't have the feature it was promised, I went back to return the car and they said that my 5 day trial period started the day I signed the contract.

They are not giving me my down payment money and keep stalling me.
Even Up to today, it's been more than 3 weeks that I have asked for a refund, they keep stalling me saying they can do nothing.

This dealership is shady. I suggest you not to go there. 

This was the first car I was buying with hard-earned money, they just made it a really bad experience for me.",2,very bad dealership not happy with them at all i bought a car from them the car had some damage in the hood and bumper it was showing nothing in the carfax report which was really strange business usually run on trust my biggest mistake was trusting them they made me test drive a different car claiming that my car would have the exact same feature which it did not they made me wait for a month to get the car told me it would take a week to fix it made me sign the contract for the car before the car was fixed and also said that my car trial period would start after my car was fixed and i get my car since my car didnt have the feature it was promised i went back to return the car and they said that my day trial period started the day i signed the contract they are not giving me my down payment money and keep stalling me even up to today its been more than weeks that i have asked for a refund they keep stalling me saying they can do nothing this dealership is shady i suggest you not to go there this was the first car i was buying with hard earned money they just made it a really bad experience for me,1

1073,848,03-Sep-18,"This was the worst car buying experience ever. I was even a car salesman myself once, and I have never seen a lower of level of shady than at Gulfgate Dodge. 

They pull the bait and switch with their internet sales prices. beware! then they try and add ""accessories"" to the sales price of the vehicle. 

then, not telling me what you will give me on my trade before knowing the payoff. remember, they are going to give you what they are going to give you, regardless of what you do or do not owe on your trade in. 

then finance is even shadier, adding points to the interest rate of the loan and trying to convince someone with an 850 credit score that 6% is Chryslers best rate. 

do your homework before coming here. do not pay for ""accessories"" and get your own financing if possible. 

also, be prepared to spend countless hours going back and forth on pricing. and pay attention to how they are structuring your deal!

Then be prepared for the new vehicle to not get detailed or washed. We had to wait another day for delivery for a battery to be changed!

1731,1542,05-Nov-10,I purchased my vehicle and was asked to return to redo the contracts several weeks later because the financing had some problems and fell through.  The deal I made did not go as discussed with the finance manager and I would recommend that potential customers shop around before committing to this dealership.

1859,1679,25-Jun-16,The salesperson Alexander Popp was unprofessional. He was pissed he didn't make any money off the sale. When I told the salesperson that I was approved by my credit union for 2.99% he said we can give you the same rate and they make commission by financing thru the bank if he can get the sales price lowered. I said 'Ok'. The salesperson comes back with a 5.99% and showed me my credit rating.  I stated 'Why would I finance for 5.99% when I've been approved for 2.99%.  The salesperson Alexander Popp stated 'your credit is not good and it’s no way you could have gotten a 2.99%'. I don't give a xxxx if my credit is a 200 I'm not going to drive across town to buy a car with bad credit. If I'm approved for a 2.99% that is all you need to know. If it wasn't for the fact I liked that car you wouldn’t have never gotten my business.

1881,1702,29-Oct-14,"Our experience was horrible at best.  We came up on 10-21 and test drove a vehicle and filled out financing paperwork.  We returned on 10-22 to purchase the vehicle.  The original salesperson that we had spoke to on the phone and for our test drive was off on the day we returned to attempt to purchase the car.  We were lied to about the cost and where the car we wanted had to be picked up from.  We were told they would have to go to Dallas to pick up the car and would cost close to 1000.00 to pick it up. In reality, they really went to Five Star Ford to pick it up.  We were lied to regarding financing and not treated with respect.  The Sales and financing staff members were very condescending and arrogant.  We were passed to so many different people that the vehicle and components for our purchasing kept getting changed.  We were told we were not approved by Ford Motor Credit, and could get a higher financing rate without all the rebates, yet had it in writing from another dealership that we were approved with all the rebates that a lower interest rate.  The games this dealership played were insulting and very unnecessary.  We left with my wife in tears and totally frustrated.  We watched the sales team laugh at us through the glass windows in their see through office as we got into our car to leave.  We eventually purchased a vehicle from another Ford dealership since they had already approved us through Ford Motor Credit with all the rebates in place that we qualified for that this dealership said we couldn't receive.  Plus the other Ford dealership was very upfront, treated us with respect and had superior customer service.

2192,2028,11-Mar-20,"Accepted a price emailed from sales manager and set an appointment to come in and purchase the vehicle. Met the sales manager and he appointed a sales person to go over the car with us. After getting home and going over the contract, realized the car was priced $650 more than agreed amount. I should have payed closer attention to the numbers and didn’t want to argue over it and was going to forget about it. Over the next couple of days and several reminders from the dealership to fill out survey and give them all 10’s I explained after overpaying I didn’t feel they earned it. The sales manager did not think I understood the figures on the contract and had the gentleman from finance call me to explain. After receiving a voice mail from him I called back and explained it to him on his voicemail. Never heard from anyone at the dealership again. On the two week anniversary on the purchase of the vehicle the screen on the dash indicated there was an updated for the system. It would not download and stated to see dealership. I called the service department at Gilman and was informed I would have to schedule and appointment and drop the car off. Went by the dealership talked to the salesman, he talked to the service department and confirmed even though I was right there with the vehicle I would have to make an appointment and drop the car off. This seemed inconvenient so I called Honda Car of Katy which is a few miles from my house. After explaining the issue with no questions the gentleman said to bring it by the next morning and they would look at it. This made me realize I may have chose the wrong dealership. Today received letter from Wells Fargo with details of purchase. After turning down wheel and tire protection at least three time to the gentleman in finance he stated he would throw it in for free. No where on the contract at the dealership did it list tire and wheel protection. The letter from Wells Fargo has it listed as an add on item for $1,049.00 charge to the loan.

2270,2111,30-Jan-18,"We went to this dealership to buy an Odyssey Touring. We did a test drive and finally got to the point of negotiating price. For the whole negotiation, we were talking about out of the door (OTD) price without any trade-in or anything. In addition, we never mentioned about how much we wanted to put down for down payment. We got the the OTD price of $43,000. Then we go to finance office. Everything went fine up until the point we signed the payment paper. We agreed to put down $10,000 as our down payment which means that we will finance $33,000. But NO, on the paper, the amount we needed to finance was $35,000. Turned out, from the beginning, they had put $2,000 as my down payment without my knowledge. Basically, their PRICE WAS $45,000, not $43,000 which I was led to believe. This came at a surprise to my salesman too because as I said, we negotiated the car’s price without any down payment in mind. Moreover, when presenting the finance paper to us, instead of showing, explaining, and checking everything on it (ex: interest rate, down payment, amount finance…), the finance guy just went straight up to the monthly amount and tell us to put initial on it, trying to rush through the paper. If we haven’t caught that, we would of buy that car for $45,000 and thinking it was only $43,000. The final straw that make me writing this is when the finance guy told me that that was never his fault, that $2,000 was on the paper from the beginning and I did not read it (my thought: even your staff did not see this, and you still had to courage to blame it on me????). I understand that dealerships need to make their money somewhere, either car price, finance, extended warranties, or accessories; which is totally acceptable; but what I cannot tolerate is when they are trying to SCAM their customers. Yes, I used the word “SCAM.” Their way of doing business is highly UNETHICAL. After reading my review and you still want to give this dealership a try, by all means, be my guess. At least, keeping my experience in mind and I hope you get a good deal from them. My final warning: EXTREMELY CAREFUL WITH THIS DEALERSHIP!!!!

They took me in to the office and said my payments would be $400 per month. I said there must be some mistake, I already worked this all out on the phone and my payment is supposed to be $280.

2583,2451,19-Feb-20,"I had the worst buying experience at this dealership, it was a total waste of my time and an insult to me and my family. I went over there after finding a vehicle online trying to avoid hours of waiting, I told them exactly what I was looking for and where I needed to be numbers wise, after 3 hours there they called me to the finance office and the finance manager Victor  Told me “You are approved for $0 down and a monthly payment of $352 but is late and I want to call a couple other banks tomorrow morning to see if I can get you a better APR” so I asked him 3 times: so I am already approved for $352 correct? And he said “Yes, that’s a fact, it’s a done deal, let’s go get your new car and you can come back tomorrow to finish with the paperwork “ we came back home with the car after the finance manager told me it was a done deal. Two days after they called me to go and finish the paperwork, but surprise!! When the guy came with some numbers completely different and saying that because it was late the bank gave him a number and they change it later.... what the h is that supposed to mean??? He showed me the numbers, had me sign the agreement and then he was trying to tell me that I needed to purchase a brand new vehicle instead of an used one in order to be in that payment range, to me that is a just trying to sell something more expensive by lying to your customers, so after 3 more hours of stupidity I had to take my old car back. The only 2 people that really tried to work with me and really helped me where the sales guy Michael Stewart and his manager.

2776,2652,27-Apr-13,"Very unethical, dealership attempts to take advantage of people who have poor credit.

1. How do you tell someone they are approved for car and allow them to take the vehicle?
2. How do you not disclose that car was a demo?
3. How do you charge a new car price for a demo with over 6000 miles?

My daughter has some major credit issues, she selected this dealership because they state that can finance anyone.  She called and they told her that even with her credit score they could get her approved.  My daughter took her 2006 Mazda RX-8 which has some body damage to dealership as trade.   She selected a 2013 Sonata with a sticker price of 27K, they presented a deal where gave her 4K as a trade and selling the Hyundai for 25, they also told her they were giving her a 1000 rebate from the Hyundai Motor Corporation.  She was told that she had been approved and that she could take the car. and her payment would be around 563.  The dealership did not disclose that car had 6K miles, which mean this was not a new car.  When she called no one could give any type of explanation.  When she return to finalize the deal they told her she had only qualified for car with a payment of $450.  When she provided research on her trade and pointed out that they were not giving her a fair price and that based on research the Sonata should be discounted by several thousand for the mileage.  The Sales Manager came back with a deal where they were now giving her 5k on her car as-a trade in but the price of the car which the finance person acknowledged was demo was now $28000.  In addition they told her the bank was charging $1500 to process her loan.  When she asked for the loan company/bank name to verify they refused to give to her. At that point they got very ugly and told her they were done because she did not qualify for a 30k car and to take our business somewhere else.

After being rude and telling us to take our business somewhere else the sales guy had the nerve to call and ask us to turn around because he left his sun glasses in my daughter’s car.  If this was the last dealership in Texas I would walk before buy a car there.  I would not recommend this dealership to anyone.  They are about taking advantage of people especially people with poor credit scores and making the most profit because they think people cannot do research.

3733,3668,22-Aug-11,"My husband and I saw Baker Nissan South across the highway from the Honda Dealership and decided to come and see what they had to offer. We were met by a salesman (Carl Price).  He was super nice to deal with and was honest in answering my questions.  We found a SUV that we liked very much and decided to end our search by purchasing this vehicle.  The year on the windshield of the vehicle was listed as 2011 but in their database and according to the VIN, the car was actually a 2010.  They also had the wrong color for this vehicle listed in their database.  Carl Price had to leave work and left us with another salesman who was not helpful.  The sales manager, while negotiating a purchase price for the car, told us that he could not come down $1000 on the price because it was a demo car.  The car was not a demo, but rather a pre-owned vehicle.  Together the sales manager and the salesman promised us that they would fix the small chip on the bumper.  We explained that we lived out of state and that we would need it to be done before Sunday (the day we would be heading back home) and they said that was fine.  We did a joint credit check because we were doing a joint car loan and financing with Nissan. They offered us a low interest rate of 1.99%.  They drew up the contract and had me sign some parts of the contract and I asked where was my husband supposed to sign?  They didn’t remember it was a joint car loan even though they ran both of our credits.  That contract was discarded and a new one was printed out and both of us signed this one.   I asked for a payment mailing address and Suzette and Al Garza told us that it would come in the mail.  Upon finishing up the contract, we asked when they would have our vehicle body work complete and they gave us a deer in the headlights look.  Apparently their body shop only works during the weekdays, but we came to a decision that we would get the body work done at a Nissan dealership near our house and that Nissan Baker would pay them.  Leaving that dealership that evening, both my husband and I felt very unsettled.  We were concerned that there were so many problems with the car purchase but after some thinking we thought that there would be no more problems since the contract was completed.  WRONG!!!!  I had problems getting the dealership to call the dealership near my home to arrange payment for the bodywork.  After a few times of calling each dealership to figure out the communication issue, they did finally communicate and the paint chip was fixed.   A few weeks later, I was beginning to wonder where notification was as to where our first payment was to be sent.  A few days later, I (not my husband) received notification that the financing for my loan was not accepted.  I was quite concerned about why the financing for this loan was not accepted and was wondering why this only had my name and not both of our names on it.  I called the dealership and was told that my financing was declined temporarily because they accidentally pushed the first incorrect contract through. They also mentioned that the second contract that we signed was also invalid because it needed an arbitration agreement (which was standard among contracts).  Once a third contract and arbitration was signed, the financing would be accepted.  They asked us when we would be coming in to sign the contracts, to which we replied we can’t.  We don’t live in the state and this is not our mistake.  They told us that our contract was not valid until this was signed and that they would overnight a new contract to us.  In return for signing a release in full (arbitration agreement), they would make our first payment for us. The finance manager told us that it would be in the mail shortly and asked us for our mailing address.  It was not sent until over a week later and was sent to the wrong address.  After some time, the car dealership does do what they promised, by paying our first payment.  We ended up getting a payment address and were able to pay our second and third payments.  The Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation (NMAC) website which allows you to keep up with your billing statements and payments still does not show that we have paid anything even though they cashed our checks on August 8th.  I call and check on this last week and they said that it should update with 72 hours of payment processing.   It is August 22nd and it still shows no update.  I also ask about where our license plates and registration are and NMAC says they can’t tell me because the dealership has not even sent over the title to the vehicle.  They told me that I needed to call the dealership and look into this problem.  We purchased this vehicle in May and we still do not have a license plate and/or registration.  I call the dealership, get a voicemail, clearly leave my name and number twice and ask for a call back to which no one calls me back.  I do not feel that buying a car should be this much trouble.  I love my Nissan, but I will never buy another Nissan again.  This stress this dealership has caused me far outweighs my love for my car.  Please think twice about buying from this dealership and if you do, DO NOT FINANCE with Nissan.  Go somewhere else for financing . . .  the finance department at this dealership is INCOMPENTENT.  Save yourself many headaches.  ",79,my husband and i saw baker nissan south across the highway from the honda dealership and decided to come and see what they had to offer we were met by a salesman carl price he was super nice to deal with and was honest in answering my questions we found a suv that we liked very much and decided to end our search by purchasing this vehicle the year on the windshield of the vehicle was listed as but in their database and according to the vin the car was actually a they also had the wrong color for this vehicle listed in their database carl price had to leave work and left us with another salesman who was not helpful the sales manager while negotiating a purchase price for the car told us that he could not come down on the price because it was a demo car the car was not a demo but rather a pre owned vehicle together the sales manager and the salesman promised us that they would fix the small chip on the bumper we explained that we lived out of state and that we would need it to be done before sunday the day we would be heading back home and they said that was fine we did a joint credit check because we were doing a joint car loan and financing with nissan they offered us a low interest rate of they drew up the contract and had me sign some parts of the contract and i asked where was my husband supposed to sign they didn t remember it was a joint car loan even though they ran both of our credits that contract was discarded and a new one was printed out and both of us signed this one i asked for a payment mailing address and suzette and al garza told us that it would come in the mail upon finishing up the contract we asked when they would have our vehicle body work complete and they gave us a deer in the headlights look apparently their body shop only works during the weekdays but we came to a decision that we would get the body work done at a nissan dealership near our house and that nissan baker would pay them leaving that dealership that evening both my husband and i felt very unsettled we were concerned that there were so many problems with the car purchase but after some thinking we thought that there would be no more problems since the contract was completed wrong i had problems getting the dealership to call the dealership near my home to arrange payment for the bodywork after a few times of calling each dealership to figure out the communication issue they did finally communicate and the paint chip was fixed a few weeks later i was beginning to wonder where notification was as to where our first payment was to be sent a few days later i not my husband received notification that the financing for my loan was not accepted i was quite concerned about why the financing for this loan was not accepted and was wondering why this only had my name and not both of our names on it i called the dealership and was told that my financing was declined temporarily because they accidentally pushed the first incorrect contract through they also mentioned that the second contract that we signed was also invalid because it needed an arbitration agreement which was standard among contracts once a third contract and arbitration was signed the financing would be accepted they asked us when we would be coming in to sign the contracts to which we replied we can t we don t live in the state and this is not our mistake they told us that our contract was not valid until this was signed and that they would overnight a new contract to us in return for signing a release in full arbitration agreement they would make our first payment

3770,3714,11-Aug-11,"This experience was horrible.  Bottom line, I explained that I could only afford a $500.00 payment.  The salesman came and left several times.  Finally, agreeing.
I was then transferred to Mr. Green in finance.  He gave me this story about wrecking my car without gap coverage.  I agreed to the additional $67.00 fee a month.
I refused the extended coverage.  Months later looking at my contract, I have all coverages that I denounced.  The gap did not cost $67.00.  The additional coverage was due to the high interest rate.

Please, Please, review your contract before you leave.  Make sure that the contract matches was the finance manager states.  Also, do not trade a car here, they granted me significantly below blue book.

260,4646,10-Jul-18,"I purchased a car here and one of the finance managers (John Fulgoni) added gap insurance and an extended warranty without asking me. He told me that my monthly was a little higher because of the finance rate that I qualified for, and that I got a warranty for free because I worked at Toyota Corporate. All turned out to be a lie he used to leach commission from me.

Some time later I checked my loan amount and it was about $2,000 higher than I remember the value of the car. I went back and they told me it was because I signed up for the warranty, etc. Needless to say, I was extremely upset. They even produced a document where I had signed off on the lower rate and then the document where I signed off on the higher rate. They're great at confusing their customers to increase their bottom line.

I spoke to the manager Tony Pan and he refunded the gap insurance after many months of back and forth, but refused to do anything about the extended warranty because I had used it (car was leaking pretty much right after I drove it off the lot, I was also encouraged to use my ""free warranty"" by the sleazebag finance manager that added it for me). Extended warranty itself cost me $1,700. 

The team dragged their feet over 2 months trying to ""help"" me but in the end, I'm stuck with what I, admittedly, signed off on. But beware of John Fulgoni, he is a lying xxxxxxx through and through, and denied everything. The managers refused to help me.

Moral of the story is read everything through very carefully before you sign anything, and stay away from John Fulgoni or he might refinance your shirt too while he's at it.",99,i purchased a car here and one of the finance managers john fulgoni added gap insurance and an extended warranty without asking me he told me that my monthly was a little higher because of the finance rate that i qualified for and that i got a warranty for free because i worked at toyota corporate all turned out to be a lie he used to leach commission from me some time later i checked my loan amount and it was about higher than i remember the value of the car i went back and they told me it was because i signed up for the warranty etc needless to say i was extremely upset they even produced a document where i had signed off on the lower rate and then the document where i signed off on the higher rate theyre great at confusing their customers to increase their bottom line i spoke to the manager tony pan and he refunded the gap insurance after many months of back and forth but refused to do anything about the extended warranty because i had used it car was leaking pretty much right after i drove it off the lot i was also encouraged to use my free warranty by the sleazebag finance manager that added it for me extended warranty itself cost me the team dragged their feet over months trying to help me but in the end im stuck with what i admittedly signed off on but beware of john fulgoni he is a lying xxxxxxx through and through and denied everything the managers refused to help me moral of the story is read everything through very carefully before you sign anything and stay away from john fulgoni or he might refinance your shirt too while hes at it,1
266,4756,27-Mar-19,"I had a 2016 Jetta that I had 20K mileage over the lease. So I didn't want to deal with the dealership with the lease return and decided to contact Volkswagen credit directly to purchase the vehicle, so that I wouldn't have to pay the 20k mileage overage cost. I secure the loan through VW credit for the purchase and I get a call from Travis the leasing manager at Clay Cooley VW Richardson. He says that I will have to pay the TT&L straight from my pocket if I purchase through VW credit. So I go to the  dealership to execute the loan and roll in the TT&L. When I show up he is eager to show me a new lease, I told him I came to purchase and he claimed that If I lease another vehicle I would owe nothing on the old lease.
So since this was the reason I was going to purchase the vehicle to avoid the mileage charge on the old lease I went ahead and signed up for a new lease and I left happy. Well surprise, I received an letter in the mail 3/26/2019 that I owe $5K for mileage charge from old lease, I called VW credit and they claimed they don't do what I explained the dealership described. I call Travis the same day and he lied to me and claimed that no he only was talking about my last payment not any lease return charges. It makes me sick to my stomach and very angry that I was taking advantage of. I should have know better because when they typed up the new lease for the new car they put that my annual mileage was 5,000 per year and I had to have them correct and make it 15,000 miles per year.  If you use this dealership you better have every single item in writing. It is a shame that these guys lived up to the old cliché of Car Sales are crooks. If you find a good dealer and sales person keep going back because they are few and far between. I will now start my letter campaign to every executive in VW.
