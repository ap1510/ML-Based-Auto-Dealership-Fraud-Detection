1,"January 30, 2020",We live in Mineral Wells and opt to take our vehicles to this service department because they are always accommidating and keep us updated on things! Husband's truck had a EGR recall and the parts were scarce. Shelby kept us updated the entire time and let us know when they got the part and when it was done! Best part is he had a loaner which she had already worked out for us while they had the truck! ,5.0
2,"January 20, 2020",Skylar Gilland was an amazing salesman!  He helped me find the exact vehicle I wanted within my budget!  He listened to what I wanted and found my dream vehicle!  I would definitely recommend him!,5.0
3,"January 19, 2020","Purchasing a 2014 Honda Ridgeline from Roger Williams CDJR was easy, especially since it was an online purchase, and my first one, to boot.  Michelle was super helpful, and she even texted me additional photos of the car then answered my questions on the spot.  The car's price was a fair deal according to Edmunds.com, Consumer Reports, and Kelly Blue Book, so no complaints there.  Michelle even recommended a top notch transporter who gave me a good deal on shipping from Texas to Michigan.  Based on my experience, I'd recommend buying a car from Roger Williams CDJR.",4.8
4,"January 13, 2020","I worked with Shelby in the Service Center; or actually she worked with me to make my Service needs ""painless"".   I had a major issue with a newly purchased used vehicle, and Shelby went out of her way to repair my Jeep, and kept in constant 'contact' with me to keep me informed on the (quick) progress of the issue(s).

I highly recommend you talk to Shelby if you have any Service questions on your vehicle.",5.0
5,"January 11, 2020",Bought a  slightly used 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee. Sale went vary well and simple. Wife wanted to get floor Mats that we’re missing and got a resounding NO. Apparently not worth $250 it would have cost for the mats. Probably not buying  another vehicle  from them. ,3.0

and I paid a fair price.  Very easy to do business with this dealership.",5.0
7,"December 23, 2019","Michelle Coursey was our salesperson, along with manager Robert “Rob” treated us fairly and were nice to work with on our purchase of a 2018 Chevy Tahoe. I think like most dealerships the staff is restricted to certain abilities to negotiate too much but overall we are completely satisfied with our experience and recommend Michelle as your choice for a used car sale at this dealer",3.8
8,"December 17, 2019",The whole buying process was amazing.  Best buying I ever had. Thanks Rob Howard. You were cordial and professional.  It was an awesome Truck buying experience!,5.0
9,"December 09, 2019","It was fantastic! We were treated very well! Michele was great to work with. Got a good price on the Charger, everyone we ran into was helpful, friendly and took time to talk with us. I'm not sure if it was owner or manager who took time to thank us for our business (first time that's ever happened). Another first, have a 3500 Ram that had a recall issue. No appt. or prior warning for them. At 12:30 p. m. on Sat. when they close at 2:00., they took it in right away and fixed it. Thanks Shelby!
There is no reason I would not go back to buy another vehicle or have service. And no reason to not recommend them!
Thanks y'all!

Bryant, our salesman, was fantastic! He was very friendly and informative on all vehicles.

19,"July 23, 2019","My first service dept experience here was with my 2012 2500 Ram in Nov 2018. At that time it was a oil change, tire rotation and diesel fuel service.  By the weekend I was on the side of the road due to the fuel pump fuse blowing and a 250.00 tow bill back to the dealership. (I live an hour away) They did not charge for the blown fuse as they was not sure whose fault it was. They just worked on this part of the system, it never blew before and has not since so I know whose at fault. I had purchased a oil change package so I went back for a second visit on July 2019 to have the oil changed and tires rotated.  During the rotation they found two of the rear lug studs had been cross threaded from the last visit. Instead of replacing what they had damaged, they refreshed the damaged threads. I am not too happy about that, but maybe it is for the best as they did not take apart the rear end to fix it correctly. No telling what new problems I would have if that had been done! On the positive side most of the staff are friendly and the waiting area is clean with refreshments. ",2.2
20,"June 26, 2019","Found what we were looking for on Autotrader.  We called and spoke to Rob Howard.  He was very helpful.  We told him we would like to see the truck.  He told us to come on over.  When we got there they already had the truck detailed and had filled the gas tank.  We took it for a test drive.  Rob was very friendly and patient with a couple of old folks like us.  Our son was with us and he was very impressed with our experience and he doesn't impress easily.  He is already bragging on Facebook about Roger Williams CDJ and says that is where his next vehicle is going to be bought.   Rob answered all our questions.  We paid cash for the truck and drove it home that day.  It was the perfect experience of truck shopping for us and we have already recommended Roger Williams Chrysler Dodge Jeep and our wonderful salesman, Rob Howard to some of our friends who are looking to buy soon.  ",5.0
21,"June 14, 2019","Jake Basinger was incredible, I was able to secure financing prior to my arrival and spent less than 1 hour total at the dealership, including a test drive and the paperwork.  The finance guy went out of his way to mention that he did not blast my application to several banks but only to those that would work with my terms.  I appreciated that. as small as that might be to some people, it was important to me.  I purchased a used vehicle this time around, was very happy with my purchase and I will definitely be a return customer for my next vehicle purchase, new or used.  I got a great deal on a super nice truck with very low miles.  Very nice facility and nice people.  ",5.0

26,"April 15, 2019","We are new to the area. Called and asked to speak to a great salesman. Jeff was our sales guy. The moment we arrived we were greeted. Jeff answered all of our questions. Never felt pushed or rushed. Enjoyed looking at all the amazing vehicles at this dealership. Found the perfect truck! Thanks to Jeff, Mr. Williams and the entire dealership staff we got our dream truck. Highly recommend this dealership. The best customer service we have ever had.

Thanks again! -Justin and Kristy ",5.0
27,"March 28, 2019","Great experience!  After finding a Chrysler 300 of interest on Autotrader.com, I sent a response through the website.  I received a prompt reply to setup an appointment.  Later that day, my wife and I drove the 60 miles from Dallas to the dealership.  We were greeted upon arrival and dealt with very professionally.  The vehicle was exactly as represented in the online listing.  In 2 hours we completed the test drive, reached a negotiated settlement, completed the transaction, and was driving away.  It doesn't get much better than that!",5.0
28,"March 20, 2019","The only reason they get 1 star is because there aren’t any negative stars! I’m in the process of jumping through all their hoops to buy a truck and they wholesale it out from under me. They won’t take a deposit to hold it, they won’t take a cashiers check to buy it, I have to wire them the money. I’m talking to 2 salespeople and a Manager working on getting this done because I’m 5 hours away, when all of a sudden over a period of a few hours the communications stop. The first salesperson involved follows up with me, I tell him I’m still waiting on wiring instructions, then let’s me know they sold it at auction while I was in this long process they were requiring. Not that big of a deal, not like I can’t go find another truck, but just a bright shining example of what gives car dealers the bad reputation for being shady, untrustworthy and non-transparent and making it very difficult for all the good dealers out there who have stepped out of the dark ages and are trying to do it right. If your looking for the unfortunately still a few around “typical car dealer” experience then here’s your guy, if not look around and read reviews you’ve got many many good choices!

29,"March 09, 2019","We found the truck we thought we wanted on CarGurus who put us in touch with Tyler, the internet sales manager.  He was great from initial contact to final signature.  We confirmed that the CarGurus price was the asking price and told him up front we were not interested in any of the myriad of add-ons so typically foisted upon you at closing.  We weren't even asked to look at them!  That's truly a first.  We drove away with a great deal and certainly couldn't be more pleased.",5.0

32,"February 26, 2019","Purchasing my Jeep through Roger Williams (RW) was a overwhelmingly positive experience that truly exceeded my expectations.

33,"January 22, 2019","Isaac was so patient with me, I have been in contact with him for over a month about purchasing a new Ram 2500. We finally found the PERFECT one for me and he got me through financing, etc within 45 minutes time!  AMAZING!!

37,"November 02, 2018","Because we were in need of a vehicle fast, we needed to get one as soon as the Collision Center determined our truck was not going home with us at any point. I called New Car Sells and made an appointment with Dillion. He was so good about keeping us up to date on the process. We were texting back and forth and he answered all my questions. When we finally got to the final paperwork, it was a breeze.  They did great.  Dillion showed me where all the bell and whistles were.  He spent extra time explaining things to my husband under the hood. I hope my 2019 Jeep Grand Cherokee is in our family for a long time, but if I ever need to get another vehicle, Roger Williams will be the first place I call.",5.0

52,"May 04, 2018","My wife took her mother to buy a car at Roger Williams in Weatherford. They found a used vehicle she wanted to buy, agreed on a price including a 3 year warranty. The salesman Brandon, who said he contacted his boss for approval on the deal and was making arrangements to buy the car with a cash deal then was told ""they"" the dealership had made a mistake, and the car was now $2,300.00 more. I contacted the used car manager ""Otis"" who said he would look at it for us and get back with me. Apparently even though the dealership agreed on the price including the warranty, they forgot to add the price of the warranty in? That was the question Brandon went to ask if they could do on the original deal. Understanding ""they"" made the mistake, I still offered to add $500.00 to our end to work with them and again was told by ""Otis"" he would look into it and he would get back with me. I figured this decision should not take to long since the salesman normally ""has to take it to the manager"" to get deals approved, but I was dealing with him direct.  After a couple of hours I called back and ""Otis"" said they could not loose money on the deal and the decision was still the same, ""sorry we made the mistake and even though our salesman made the deal with approval we just cant do it."" I new better than let her go there again. Second time, same situation about 3 years ago. Times are changing and a persons word just does not mean as much as it did. Weatherford is growing so I guess we should not expect the small town car dealers attitude any more. Its all about them. There will be 10 new customers go in the door as we go out so to them, its a win. Brandon made a mistake and we don't blame him at all. He talked to his manager, told us what they could do and they left him holding the bag.  I feel that management should stand behind a deal when they make it, especially if the customer tries to help as well. Everyone was friendly, the price started out good but turned for the worst once we said, ""we will take it""!  ",2.0

57,"March 06, 2018","Ok, I was skeptical the very first time I was contacted by Salesman Jerome Pena in reference to trading my 2015 Jeep Renegade w/42500 miles on it. My credit is not the best. He called me back to tell me he thought he could get below or at my payments now. Sure, I thought. I went to visit him at 2 pm on a Saturday afternoon. At 4 pm I drove out in my new 2017 renegade. My payments are lower and I have an extended warranty. Ryan T. was very easy to work with in the finance dept. No, pushing or games here.

I was told to drop it off first thing in the morning and it would be done by end of day.  I was also told if i needed a vehicle that I could go to Enterprise Rental and for $50.00 I could rent a vehicle for the day.  What bs!   I am done with Roger Williams period.  I will drive an hour south to another Chrysler dealer for service.   ",1.0

My daughter went back to pick up tags and front desk was rude. We had a BnW 5th wheel installed and when we tried to pick up the part they took out, they could not find records of our service.

89,"May 31, 2017","Since my salesperson was fired/quit, nobody took over my vehicle purchase. I built the Wrangler I wanted, waited six weeks for it to come in, but when I went to pick it up, there wasn't anyone there who acted like they even knew me or what was going on. I paid cash, ordered additional protection package, and have had ZERO follow-up with regard to any services that should have come with my purchase - like oil changes. My last vehicle was an Audi and their after sale interest in keeping me satisfied continued until I traded it in on a Jeep.....something I am regretting.

On top of this, the sale commission went to the internet sales person who I exchanged about two emails with - that's it and that was 6 months before my purchase.  You would think that some

one coming in, special ordering, and paying cash would warrant a tad more attention.  During my wait for the finance people to draw up the paperwork (they knew I was coming), they had two or three people that they had ""entertain me"", I don't need that.  I am seriously thinking of dumping the Jeep and going back to a dealership that actually deals in service after the sale.  ",1.0

The deal went great and  he was there thru out the whole process making sure it all went well and we were happy. Finance dept. was great and not pushy and the girl that went over the operation of the car as good also.

100,"February 23, 2016","I bought a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee over the internet from Roger Willams.  My sales guy was great to work with and seemed interested in helping me get the deal done.  He missed several dents and damage to the front bumper which was not told to me prior to purchasing and was not easily seen in pictures.  Overall repair cost to fender and bumper was $575.  As an expert in buying cars in NC from out of state dealers, I made sure they had all the correct NC paperwork and instructed them where to send the paperwork (DMV office).  They ignored all the information I gave them and sent it to Raleigh.  4 weeks later it was returned to them incorrect!  Big surprise there.  Now, they are finally taking my advice and following my instructions.  Title clerk is inept and seems to be afraid to take advice from someone that has titled more cars than her (I was a GM of a dealer for over 20 years).

If you are an out of state buyer.....STAY CLEAR of this dealer.  They will screw your paperwork up and you will be waiting forever for a title and tag.  And make sure you have the vehicle inspected by an independent 3rd party.  It is obvious that they will omit telling you about any damage.

This place has a poor online review history from just about everywhere online for a reason.  And management does not seem to care about getting any of it resolved.  This is the sort of place that gives dealerships a bad rap.",2.0
101,"December 31, 2015","Recently, I put a vehicle in the Roger Williams auto repair shop. To this date, it has been there 11 days longer than the estimated completion date.  I can't seem to get a straight answer as to why it's taking so long or when it will be completed.  I have called to speak with the general manager twice but have been transferred to the service manager, Robert, who obviously could care less and said he would have the auto body manger call me.  That was 2 days ago and he still hasn't returned my call, obviously because he still has no idea when the vehicle will be done. This is the worst service I have ever received from any dealership I have ever done business with. I you need body work, take your vehicle somewhere else, unless you like to be jerked around and frustrated.....Roger Williams Dodge is in business for themselves, not for the customers. ",1.0
102,"July 06, 2015","Wow ... it's hard to even describe what a horrible experience we've had with Roger Williams Dodge. And if you're thinking of buying from them, read this entire review to get all the details --  I'd like to think I can save at least one person from making the same mistake!

We first started working with Randy Marr in used car sales in late May and agreed to a price for a 2013 RAM 2500 on May 30. My husband and son headed out that afternoon (we live in Dallas) to pick up the truck and made it to Ft. Worth before getting a call saying the truck still needed to go through a service check and detail before they could release it. Randy promised it would be delivered to us in Dallas on Monday, June 1. Let me just note that this was my son's first vehicle, so it was a huge and exciting deal for him.

I'll spare you the LONG list of excuses (everything from missing keys to doctor's appts to issues with the service dept) we got every day thereafter for why the truck was not ready, but suffice it to say that it was only by threatening to move on to another dealership that we were even able to pick up the truck on June 4. Randy mentioned that there had been an issue with the transmission that was fixed under warranty -- he downplayed it and provided no details. He also threw the service department under the bus and entirely blamed them for the delay (they in turn blamed him for not even letting them know the truck had been sold as a reason for why they hadn't been working on it). Oh, and when we finally drove the truck off after a week of broken promises and delays, it had about 1/8 tank of gas ... which IMO kind of sucks.

Skip forward less than a month from taking ownership of the truck. My son is driving on a major road and the truck engine starts going haywire -- automatically shifting gears, engine revving but no speed, overheating, etc. We end up having the truck towed to a Dallas area Dodge dealership. They do a diagnostic test and learn that the problem is ... wait for it ... THE TRANSMISSION. Long story short, the service guys at RW pretty much slapped a band-aid on the transmission to get it out the door. Records show that they only replaced the transmission fluid pump and one other small part -- they did not even bother to change the transmission fluid. The service advisor here told me that it was beyond just dirty; it was actually burned. And there was no reason for it ... the service department gets paid for the work they do whether it's by the customer or by Chrysler (through the warranty). The entire transmission is shot and needs to either be rebuilt or replaced. The only saving grace is that it will still be covered by the power train warranty.

So, bottom line if you're thinking of doing business with Roger Williams: they are slow, unprofessional, dishonest (they knew something was wrong with the truck but would never say what), and the sales and service guys seem to hate each other. My son came very close to having a serious accident because of their shoddy workmanship and shady business practices. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS DEALERSHIP TO MY WORST ENEMY.",1.0
