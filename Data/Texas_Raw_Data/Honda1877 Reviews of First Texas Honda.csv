9,"June 14, 2020","Daylight robbery by first Texas Honda service center, I have a Honda Accord hybrid 2018 and when it was under warranty the normal battery was having issues which generally has 100 month warranty on it, so I took it to these guys to get it checked and they changed the battery stating it needed replacement as it was faulty and was changed under car warranty. now barely a year later the battery again has died and I took the issue to them again as the battery was placed new still comes with 100 month warranty they said I will have to pay because I got the battery for free when it was under car warranty so the new battery that they placed has no warranty as it was done for free.That is dishonest and looting. I have never seen such greed anywhere else. My total car mileage is barely 39000 miles.",1.0
10,"June 14, 2020","I have a special disdain for buying a car, when it comes time to do so, because each time I've done so, I've worked with dishonest salespeople who didn't recognize my concerns and desires. However, this time around, my wife and I decided to trade in our Civic for a CRV, and were delighted to work with Scott McCoy. He respected our constraints by not even asking us to consider anything very far outside of them, did not waste our time, and landed us in a vehicle almost exactly at the price point we wanted. For the first time, a car-buying experience has not left a bad taste in my mouth. ",5.0
11,"June 13, 2020",Trust your service department.  Have gone above and beyond for us in the past year.  Staff are curteous and have kept us infrormed of tenetative concerns/,5.0
12,"June 13, 2020",Everyone encountered friendly and efficient.  Really easy scheduling and quick appointment .  More expensive than expected; was not warned of possible cost at time of appointment.  Prompt service.  ,5.0

14,"June 11, 2020",Scheduling service for my Honda was such an ease. Angelica emailed me promptly and scheduled me in for the very next day. My service advisor Jack Wright kept me updated and informed. Everyone I interacted with was friendly and professional! Picking up and turning in my loaner car was a very smooth process as well.  ,5.0

16,"June 11, 2020",Everyone here is friendly...I even got bumped up the line last time since I was squeezing in only an inspection.  Nice waiting room.  We've bought 2 Hondas here now.  ,5.0
17,"June 10, 2020",Everything was extremely smooth from front to end. Scott McCoy was able to answer all of my questions and even answered questions that I didn’t even think of asking (but I definitely should have). He was able to really show my wife all of the features and functions of the 2019 Odyssey we bought. Jeff in finance was really great too. Helped us secure a great certified warranty so we do not have to worry about any mechanical issues for the next 150k miles. So glad I made the drive to Austin to grab this beautiful Odyssey. ,5.0

21,"June 05, 2020",Scheduling an appt was super easy and I am very pleased that the service dept has such an early start time. It works great with my work schedule. My service advisor Chris Buchanan was super helpful and his professionalism is superb.  ,5.0
22,"June 03, 2020","I cannot sufficiently express how pleased I was with Wayne's ability to simplify the process. His first bid convinced me that he listened and adapted to my way of buying. I worked five quotes on this one in the Houston area, and bought from Wayne in Austin! Every question met a ready and direct answer, and everything promised was delivered! I've purchased autos for myself and my company for more than thirty years. This was, by far, the easiest deal I've been a party to. Wayne, and First Texas Honda, will always have the first opportunity when I need a vehicle. 

I knew of the dealership, and its reputation for excellent service, because my spouse's family has purchased five vehicles there over the years. I can now vouch for that reputation myself.",5.0
23,"June 03, 2020",Scott was a pleasure to work with. He took his time with me and helped get the best deal for my new car! I would recommend him to anyone looking for a vehicle.,5.0

26,"June 01, 2020","His attention to detail, great communication skills and ready smile made the experience better than I expected.  He addressed all my concerns and made sure my car, ""Bob Boing,"" was in tiptop shape.  Great service.",5.0
27,"June 01, 2020","I had a really great experience buying a new car at First Texas Honda today. Our sales agent was Scott McCoy. He walked my wife and I through the whole experience with a great deal of patience and a wealth of invaluable information that guided us to make the right car choice. Additionally, Scott was very knowledgeable about the cars, the dealership, and the process. He made the whole experience seamless for us. 
Thank you Scott and thank you First Texas Honda.",5.0
28,"May 31, 2020","Trudy Gordon helped me today and she did such a good job! She thoroughly explained everything, gave helpful information to help me decide which services to have done, and was extremely polite and nice. I could just tell how much she cared about doing a good job and about me having a good experience. The work on my car was done to my satisfaction and they did an excellent job cleaning it, a great bonus I really appreciate. I also appreciate that staff were wearing masks and eliminated the need for me to touch the credit card keypad. ",4.8
29,"May 31, 2020",This was my first time at your service center. The entry was very efficient and the wait was accurate (~90 min). Ivan did a great job explaining things and keeping me updated. First class job overall.,5.0
30,"May 30, 2020","I worked with Greg and Jared.  I had called ahead and spoken to Greg.  I told him I had seen a vehicle on their website (which does need some work, by the way) and what I wanted, and within a few minutes we had come to a tentative agreement.  Within a couple of hours I was able to get there.  Greg had become popular that day, so he introduced me to Jared.  Jared showed me the car (it was actually on the showroom floor), we took it on a test drive, and then we were dealing.  We got to where *I* wanted rather quickly.  Then it was just a matter of waiting on the finance guy (I forget his name but just as helpful) and signing everything.  I think the total time was a couple of hours, but one thing I love about this place is the waiting area.  There’s a coffee/snack bar, all complimentary.  As well, for those with kids there’s a play area, and there’s plenty of seating for everyone.  I was able to sit (reasonably distanced for the current health situation) and work while waiting.  At least for me, because I had done my research and knew what I was going to pay, there was none of the back-and-forth that car dealers are duly criticized for.  I think, however, had I gone through that it would have been not as bad as most.

My average rating below for quality of work is not for the sales department; it’s for the service area.  They are up and down.  Ironically, I had been trying to reach Jack in Service.  He had called me to take care of a problem I had been having with the audio system of my CR-V that I was about to trade in.  I returned his call within a very short time and left a message.  Didn’t get a return call.  I called again a week later.  Again, no response.  That car has now been traded in, but after 2 weeks I never got a return call.

So, again, Sales is/was a hit;  Service, not so much.",4.6
31,"May 30, 2020",Excellent service as always. Friendly staff. Clean and safe waiting area. Excellent coffee and soda bar. Brought car in with no appointment due to flat tire and was helped immediately. ,5.0
32,"May 30, 2020",I was there for regular maintenance and was very pleased with the service I received.  Ivan told me it might take 1 1/2 hours.    I took a short walk and Ivan called to ask some questions and it wasn’t long before my car was ready.  Loved that they washed it before returning it!  Thank you!!,5.0
33,"May 29, 2020","Fred Mathis provided excellent service.  He advised on a number of items we needed to have work on, and gave us options.  The work was completed very quickly.  As always--easy in and done!",4.8
34,"May 28, 2020",Chris Buchanan was very friendly and helpful when I had to bring my car in for a flat tire at 6am. I will definitely be asking for him at my future visits. ,5.0
35,"May 27, 2020",Got in.  Was helped by a few folks before Myron joined me. Was a pleasant and safe experience. Got my car in the time estimated. ,5.0
36,"May 27, 2020",I started with Consumer Reports car buying service. After deciding on a vehicle I saw the inventory for local dealers. Selected First Texas because they listed the model and color I wanted. First Texas then showed a price. I went in and dealt with Sean Shields. He was knowledgeable and personable and no pressure. We quickly decided options and came to a deal. So far very impressed by dealership and sales experience. ,5.0
37,"May 27, 2020","DO NOT BUY FROM THIS HONDA DEALERSHIP. Every time I have had a question I am treated like a child and always pushed away. I never had a constant salesman and always pushed around. When buying the car, the finance team was xxxx and was rushing me while I was still having questions. I explained that this was my first car buying and still have the worst experienced with customer services.  ",1.2

43,"May 19, 2020",Myron Jones did a wonderful job of communicating and taking care of our needs! Kept us informed of progress and appreciate the detail to the car.,5.0
44,"May 16, 2020","This is the 3rd vehicle we have purchased from FIrst Texas Honda. Amazing experience, Scott McCoy was wonderful to work with. Wouldn’t go anywhere else for our cars. He went above and beyond with the sale, gave us a very personal experience and didn’t just try to push the purchase giving me the time I needed to make the decision. ",5.0
45,"May 16, 2020","I have to put my trust in a dealer to keep my car running safely because I have no mechanical sense at all.  I woke up with a car that would not start.  With the help of a neighbor I got the car started and headed straight for First Texas Honda.  Although I did not have a reservation, the service department worked me in and determined that I needed a new battery.  I also asked them to do the 28 point check up while the car was there.  They installed a new battery and determined that everything else was in good running order and I left feeling secure that the car was safe to drive and would not leave me stranded.  The time passed quickly as I spent my time in a pleasant waiting room enjoying a cup of coffee and a pastry.  The overall experience was very pleasant.",5.0
46,"May 16, 2020","After a metal screw ruined my left rear tire, I went to First Texas Honda to get it repaired.  While there, I found out that the tire was ruined and I had to purchase a new one.  I had bought the set of tires at First Texas Honda back in 2018.  While there, might as well get my car serviced and ready for a trip if necessary.  I used the waiting area.  I love the place because it provides excellent drinks, water, tea, or whatever you require.  It took a few hours, but my car was made road worthy for a trip.  I have used First Texas Honda for many years and have bought several cars there.  I most certainly would recommend First Texas Honda to anyone.  ",5.0
47,"May 15, 2020","I bought my Honda here, but this is the first time I brought it in for service. It was a very smooth process, even with jumping in a courtesy rental (which I thought would take an hour). Ty was great, communicated every step and I was provided quotes throughout the process, so there were no surprises when I paid. Will definitely bring my vehicle back in the future. ",5.0
48,"May 14, 2020","Contacted this dealership in early March 2020 online about a Red 2013 Chevy Sonic LT and requested that if they would be willing to accept $5,900 ILO of the $6,400 listed price.  I would absolutely make the 240 Mile trip from North Dallas to Austin to make the purchase that coming weekend.  The day before I was supposed to travel, they send me the paperwork and change our verbal agreement from $5,900 + TTL to $6,100 + TTL.   The following images are my attempt to counteroffer and the email exchange shows their ""professionalism"" as they claim I was ""not willing to work with them"".   

In the end, I ended up finding a similar 2013 Chevrolet Sonic RS with 107K miles for $5400 from a personal seller and THIS initial deal ended up falling through so that First Texas Honda missed getting my business and a sale over a mere $100 measly dollars.   They absolutely would not budge and work with me.   God help anyone that tries to do business here... especially with Jesse Sims.",1.4
49,"May 13, 2020",It took several days and a few visits to decide what to buy. The entire time I dealt with Scott I felt that he was trying to make sure I was getting the car I wanted. He didn't seem to care which car I bought just so I was happy. And I am very happy. Thanks First Texas Honda.,5.0

Thank you very much again Cres and Jack!

59,"May 07, 2020","I am a single middle aged lady with no knowledge of cars.  And, until today, car buying had always been a ""dreaded task""....  After driving my Jetta wagon for 10 years, I decided it was time for a new ride.  I wanted a SUV, and I wanted a Honda.  My son tells me his best friend's Dad works at First Texas Honda, so I say, let's make an appt with him!   Scott McCoy met us right on time.  He provided a tour of the extensive facility including a stop at  the complimentary snack cafe.  Scott explained the step by step car buying process in layman's terms I could easily understand. Scott's  kindness, demeanor, patience, attentiveness, knowledge, and transparency put me at ease right away, and established a trusted connection to the car buying experience.   I can honestly say buying my new Honda CR-V  was a pleasant and comfortable experience thanks to Scott McCoy!     ",5.0

68,"April 08, 2020","I came to First Texas to talk about trading in my 2016 HR-V for a 2020 HR-V.  The salesman was very friendly and answered almost all of my questions.  For the questions he couldn't answer immediately, he consulted other employees at the dealership and got the answers.  The experience was great from beginning to end.  The only thing I can say that could be improved is to have a more diverse selection of colors to choose from, but that's really a minor issue.  Overall, I was very pleased with the experience and I fully expect to return when the time comes for me to make another trade.",5.0

77,"March 21, 2020","Went in for the infamous air bag recall.  I got the first appointment of the morning, which was surprisingly early (6:15am).  Who knew service centers opened that early?!  

The airbag inflator was replaced as expected, and the dealer did a full/free multi-point inspection and wash, which I did not anticipate.  While I already knew everything that my car needed in terms of maintenance and/or repair, I was pleased that their report matched and that they weren't trying to offer me unnecessary items.

The customer waiting lobby is big and comfortable.  The coffee/snack bar is a great touch as well.  

My one nitpick is that the service was almost 2 hours, for what I figured would be an hour recall fix, but the internet allowed me to work, and the coffee was pretty good... so the time still passed quickly.  Also, it was nice to have a shiny car again for the first time in a while!",5.0

186,"December 13, 2019","Most people have never heard of rail dust. We hadn’t either, until three months after our vehicle purchase. And let me tell you, this has been a nightmare.

We purchased our new Honda Pilot this past summer and after a thorough hand wash, discovered small yellow/rust colored specks ALL OVER the vehicle. After some searching on Google, I was pretty sure, our car was covered in what’s called “rail dust”. If a vehicle is transported by train or sits by tracks, there’s a fine dust that can get into the paint. This dust is corrosive and over time, it rusts away at the vehicles paint. We went over the car VERY carefully at purchase, and it seems that it took several months for the rail dust to rust, to the point to where it could be seen.

As you can imagine, we were horrified, that our brand new $40,000 car was essentially covered in “rust”. First Texas was initially helpful and offered to do something called clay barring. This is supposed to remove the rail dust. After they had the vehicle for about a week to clay bar it, we were called, told the vehicle looked like new, and to come pick it up. It only took about 5 minutes to see, the car was STILL covered in rail dust. So, either they did a POOR job at inspecting the car, or they flat out lied to us. Either way, the car did NOT look “new” again. Okay, we gave them another shot. This time, they said the vehicle had to be taken apart and throughly went over. We were NOT happy with a brand new vehicle being disassembled OUTSIDE of the factory when it was only months old, but we felt like we had no other choice. We left the car there for about three weeks, picked it up...and guess what.. Not only was there STILL rail dust on the car, seals were put back improperly, the rear doors now are not fully aligned properly, AND they put a scratch on a door and tried to cover it up with touch up paint!!!! The trim (that also had rust), we were told was replaced, yet there are still pieces of trim that have rust. We now have a vehicle in WORSE condition then it was before we took it to the dealer. 

We are currently speaking with lawyers and the GM. Honda corporate is of NO HELP, as dealerships are privately owned, and they wash their hands of what happens at the dealerships. Last time we spoke with the GM, he offered to swap it out with another vehicle...but it would cost us $9,000. Yep, THIS IS INSANITY folks. 

Most recently, we had a professional come to look at the car. He was able to get out a couple of spots they missed and said, they must have not been thorough. He was also SHOCKED, when I told him the car was taken apart. He saw no need for that and was flabbergasted when I showed him the damage they had done to our vehicle.

I am only leaving this, because we are at our wits end. This has been absolutely horrible and people need to know, what this dealership is capable of. You’ve been warned folks.",1.2

228,"October 28, 2019","I'm the person in my extended family that everyone asks to help negotiate car deals (helping with ~12-15 car deals over the years). 

My Approach to Car Buying:
I typically find myself buying cars outside of Austin. I started this purchase by calling across Austin, San Antonio, Dallas, and Houston; asking for the internet sales team at each dealership and starting the evaluation process. This is always the first step since I want to get a feel for pricing as well as each dealership's approach to sales (are they transparent, are they willing to work on price, do they have a lot of aftermarket items packed on their cars, what are their dealer/doc fees, what's the general personality of the dealership...).  It's easy to tell when a salesperson is a true internet salesperson since the internet teams tend to be very upfront about what they can offer while a dealership that transfers ""internet sales team"" calls to their standard sales team will often respond with ""come in and we'll make you a great deal"". Anyone that insists I come in before discussing price gets scratched off the list in round 1 and the others go on to round 2 for further consideration. 

Experience with First Texas Honda:
True to my approach, I called FTH, asked for the Internet Sales Team, and was transferred to Bill Ford. Bill was straight forward, easy to deal with, and made me feel like I was the most important person in the room without making it feel overwhelming. Once I selected FTH, I emailed Bill with a few requests and he quickly responded with what they were able to do. I dropped by to finalize the agreements and filled out the credit app online later that evening (I had to un-freeze my credit and it was taking a long time). He committed to having the car ready by lunch the following day and it was ready when we arrived to sign the paperwork. The Finance conversation with Mike was smooth and while he offered all of the standard offerings, he wasn't pushy (taking time to discuss the offerings when given the opportunity but not grinding on us too much). 

Summary
Overall it was a smooth transaction and I'd gladly buy another car through Bill & First Texas Honda. ",5.0
229,"October 28, 2019","My starter was replaced for about $1000 last September.  The warranty expired September 29 of this year and the starter no longer works [October 28].

After two in person visits to the service department, it is confirmed they will not replace it and I am completely out of luck. 

This was a brand new OEM replacement starter that should have lasted a decade and barely lasted a year.  Fair play to First Honda since the 1 year warranty was technically honored by them, I guess.

Having said that, there really is no benefit at all to go to this dealership for a service repair because of the high cost and this kind of customer treatment.  

I would like to point out 1 week after they fixed the starter in September, I had to get it towed back to the dealership because they did not fasten the wiring harness tight enough.  First Honda comped the cost of the towing.

I have spent like $4,000 with First Honda and I was considering getting a CR-V for my wife. First Honda has lost a customer for life and I will go out of my way to not recommend the First Honda dealership in the future.",1.8

324,"July 22, 2019","The service department at First Texas is very good, and I commend them on their customer service and accessibility. However, after purchasing 2 factory new vehicles in July of 2018 I am now realizing that the sales department lied to me about the various warranties.

Specifically, during our negotiations I had declined the Mastertech windshield warranty coverage. However, Mike in financing convinced me that the modern sensors for lane keep assist and collision prevention were affixed to the windshield and any windshield repairs would require them to be recalibrated by the dealership at a high expense. 

Almost a year later, the heat has expanded a microcrack in my windshield and it has to be replaced. The warranty actually only covers 1 hour of labor and the windshield, and I’ve been informed I will have to pay $320 out of pocket to have the sensors recalibrated. When I asked what happens if I don’t recalibrate the sensors, they indicated that the car may veer into another lane or fail to detect other cars or objects in the path of the car.

Given that this exact scenario was used in our negotiations to get me to purchase the warranty, I have raised this issue with my service advisor who had no comment. I am now attempting to pursue this with the financing manager, but haven’t yet received any response.

Be careful of what they tell you in the sales and financing office as they intentionally misled me.",3.4

He worked hard to get me a good deal and make sure I was happy with the car, and then did a good job of helping me customize all the technology features.

Manny Jaladoni was the finance guy and I really appreciate he didn't try to upsell me some expensive package I didn't need. I only drive about 7,000/year and so it didn't make sense to pay a lot for extended warranties. I have been to dealerships before where they pressure you to buy them, and it was nice to get the info and an honest recommendation that was best for me and not for the dealerships bottom line.

Trudy was the accessories specialist and explained the different options and was patient with all my questions. I even signed up for the tinted windows upgrade for the first time and I love them. 

Even our barista, Sarah Neil, made it fun with a popsicle for my daughter and a tasty Frappuccino for me. 

The dealership has lots of fun activities and free snacks/drinks for the kids, which was really nice. My daughter and I played ping pong, foosball, video games, etc. while we waited for them to get the car ready. I wasn't ready to leave when they brought the car out.

If they cannot obtain your part that day, it typically takes no more than 2-3 days to order and receive the correct Honda OEM part. Keep your Honda running correctly using only Honda OEM PARTS.

I can manage most of them myself or I can seek out reputable locations that can do the same services but gor less.  The last time I got my car serviced, I paid $65.00.  This time I paid over $100 and the next time, I’m being told it’s time for a brake fluid flush and fuel system treatment, I’m looking at $300+ for that and nothing is broken!

546,"February 09, 2019","Since my first Honda purchase in 1993, I have loved Honda cars but more importantly, I’ve been a huge fan of the First Texas Honda dealership. In that time, I’ve driven a Civic, Element and now a Pilot, while my family drives an Accord, Odyssey and CRV. We ARE a Honda family and First Texas Honda is a huge part of that family. My most recent experience happened around my birthday when my 14.5 yr old Element came to a crossroad. Repairs or Retirement? I brought my car in for a check engine light and was impressed with my service tech’s (Aaron Yiu) experience and professionalism (tall shoes to fill as my prior service rep was Trudy Adams). I tried out the Honda Pilot as my loaner car while the service team did a thorough work up of my repair needs. I let him know we may not choose to do the repairs depending on what was found and he notified Sales that I might be needing a replacement vehicle. I promptly received a call from Sales rep Nik Barrows. I told him which 4 cars I had narrowed my pick down to and what my wish list was, what I didn’t want and my price range. When I decided the repairs were more than I wanted to invest and would rather put that $ down on a new or certified pre-owned car, Nik made sure to have on hand the same cars I was interested in and had them ready to test drive the day I returned my loaner. We looked at pre-owned and new, never considering we’d buy new. Nik was very helpful and informative on all the makes/models I looked at. He clearly knows cars (all makes and models) and helped us narrow down our choices to what worked best for our family’s needs. His assistance didn’t end once we were closing the deal with the finance man. He offered suggestions for our son’s gaming & tech needs and went above and beyond to make sure we had an exceptional car buying experience and that everyone in our family loved our new vehicle. He is friendly, without being pushy and makes it clear that he is there to make sure you have the best experience, not that he sells the most expensive model or something you don’t want or need. His follow-through and follow-ups impressed us the most. Nik Barrows is one class act!",5.0

Somehow now I needed a wheel alignment that I did not need when I brought the car in.  Took the car back to my local dealer for a full tires and break checkup.  I was told none of the recommendation from First Texas Honda was due at this time because everything was working fine as per they previous diagnostics only this time (somehow) I now need the wheel alignment.   Ended up paying $57 for the wheel alignment instead of $130 that First Texas Honda wanted to charge me.  This place seems to recommending replacement of parts and services that still fully working and If you turned then down when they have your car.. you may not know what will happened to your car.  I will never take my car at this place again and if you are planning to take your car here always seek a second opinion when dealing with this place. Very disappointed!!!

The others who tried to solicit their services (competing dealerships) paled in comparison and even used sub par tactics that only confirmed more that I had come to the right place. Nik was knowledgable and friendly and I really sensed was just interested in helping me get exactly what I wanted and a plan that fit my needs. He and Holden both excelled at customer service, timely updates and thorough search for a car  that was perfect for me. I am both pleased and impressed by the staff at First Texas Honda.

From my first telephone conversation with John Hanson to the closing of the deal, everyone was both personable and professional. Throughout our negotiation I was treated with courtesy and respect. The 2018 CR-V I was interested in was priced fairly and I was given near top dollar for my trade-ins. We couldn’t be happier with our purchase and are pleased to recommend John Hanson and First Texas Honda to anyone the market for a new vehicle.

At no time did it ever seem John was not on MY side while contemplating the purchase. Then John test drove it with me and scheduled the next day for a complete technical lesson with the dealership's technician, Beto, after getting it out on the highway himself to demonstrate lane and brake assistance. No doubt their commitment to excellent follow up full service is real. Having just completed my tech appointment with Beto, I feel excited and clear. Beto is such a good teacher!

Again, I was assured “a service coordinator would be right with me.” 10 minutes later I stopped another guy who was actually helping the “walk-in car” next to us if we would be helped soon as I was told by the last person we were the first walk-in for the day. I was told “we are short staffed today, we are getting to everyone as soon as we can.” I understand that businesses can be busy and things get backed up. I would have appreciated someone taking with me before hand that I would have to wait 45 mins before I even saw a service coordinator to tell me how long it would be.

738,"October 23, 2018","Jay Jenks and Aaron Yiu personally examined my car just two weeks after I bought it when I was having problems with the defroster and lots of squeaking with my brakes and tires. The handle of the car wasn’t great- it’s a 2013 Toyota Camry with only 44K miles on it, but I wasn’t sure about the tires. They seemed worn and were making a lot of noise and would skid in wet weather.

Jay fully inspected my car and admitted to me afterwards that the tires should have been replaced prior to me having been sold the car- I really appreciated his transparency and honesty. I could tell he was saying what he believed. Same with Aaron- both standup guys who are clearly in the business of customer service.

Unfortunately, his bosses in First Texas Honda’s service department saw it differently, even tho they didn’t examine the car. They looked at the service report, decided that the measurements were within Texas’ “minimal acceptable guidelines” markers (exact verbiage from Cody Penna- the service manager in an email to me), and told me flat out that they would not replace my tires and patronizingly told me that I could purchase new tires from them and that they’d be “happy to help.” What a joke- this place claims to be “where we put you first” but once you buy a car from them, forget about that. Extremely disappointed with my experience here, and I will never again take my car in for service here or buy or recommend that anyone else buys a car here. Too big to care. Unfortunate because I really do believe that Jay Jenks is a standup guy who did the right thing- shame the ppl he works with are penny wise and pound foolish and care about technicalities and minimal standards over service! Appreciate you, Jay and Aaron!

I respect Cody as a person and am sure he’s a nice guy (I’ve never actually met him or worked with him, he just made all the decisions from a sheet of paper), but his customer service abilities leave much to be desired. He didn’t even examine my car yet because he’s the service manager, decides that what I was told was “misinformation” and that it needed to be “clarified” when I know what I was told by the ppl who actually inspected the car. Using language like “minimal guidelines” and other technical terms to get you off the hook is not something customers are interested in hearing about- like I said, penny wise and pound foolish because you lost a customer and I sincerely suggest that ppl shop for their cars elsewhere if they want decent service post purchase.",1.8

The feedback mechanism they should be paying attention to is whether you are a repeat customer. If you've returned for service multiple times I'm pretty sure you were satisfied. I don't need to spend my days filling out surveys.",4.6

787,"September 16, 2018","Buying a car is a pain in the “you know what,” we were so happy that the stars aligned to put us with Jesse Sims at First Texas Honda.  After looking at a few other models at other dealerships, we stumbled upon a car that fit our requirements at their establishment.  After sending in an inquiry that the car was still available, Ana Angel quickly reached out to us to set up a time to take it for a test drive, and to put us in contact with Jesse, who also quickly called out to introduce himself.  Bonus points for this dealership not keeping banking hours like so many these days! With our four kids, the thought of fighting the crowds on a weekend at a dealership was giving us panic attacks.  First Texas Honda had a kids room, snacks and coffee for guests that certainly helped keep them entertained while we conducted our business with them.  From the receptionists
to the manager, this dealership really blew our socks off with their service and friendliness. But more on Jesse, he was super professional and transparent, even pointing out a few cosmetic things in the vehicle we may have otherwise not noticed until after making the purchase.  Vehicles that accommodate a family of our size are so difficult to find for a decent price, even pre-owned vans and suvs.  I appreciate the fact that Jesse has a low pressure approach to selling, and that was a huge factor in our decision to make that purchase.  After we decided to get everything in motion, the dealership offered us a financing deal and warranty, which we had already worked out with our Credit Union, but also did not pressure us into taking their deal.  I can’t fault them for offering these service add-one to earn themselves more on the sale, but I can certainly praise the fact that they accepted no for an answer.  Other dealerships I have dealt with in the past always make that such a hassle! Even after everything was signed and waiting on the bank to send over drafting instructions, Jesse stayed in contact via text and phone to make sure we weren’t waiting around for the next step.  I really just can’t say enough nice things about this experience.  We will be in the market for another car in a year or so, and I will be reaching out to Jesse and First Texas Honda first when that search begins.  If you are looking for a car salesperson that feels like an ally rather than an adversary, this is the place and he is your guy.

Consequently, the dealership had the car for all of Tuesday and Wednesday.  I picked up the car on Thursday at noon.  The solution was a software update at no charge.

794,"September 12, 2018","The team (Alex, Ryan, Mike, Bill, Naji, Charlie)  at First Texas Honda were friendly, professional. and to the man showed integrity.  They are no pressure and just very helpful.  Ryan made a great first impression and took us on our test drive.  My car is a Volt, so I am somewhat familiar with the power train/architecture, and was quite impressed with Ryan's  training and knowledge of the Clarity Hybrid Plug-in.  He knew this car and its advantages over the Volt.   My wife really liked him because he was sharp, low key, from a small town, and just a likeable guy.  Alex was the main point man who coordinated everything and was totally squared away.  When he gave us a very fair trade-in appraisal on our old Honda, with no low balling, I was pretty sure that this was my guy.   Another sharp, knowledgeable likable guy.  We see a pattern forming.   This was a team that my wife and I really wanted to work with, but regrettably didn't have our color in stock.  So we looked at other Honda places, but kept Alex and Ryan at First Texas updated on our progress through email, telling them that we hoped that a way would appear for us to partner with them.   Mike, their manager, would even send an occasional short email just to make sure we were ok and being taken care of.  No pressure, just good follow up.   Well, Alex, who kept trying to help us, went out and eventually found the right car at another dealer <100mi away and had it transported to Austin, and Bill even turned down my offer to pay them for the transport charges while giving me an opening offer below MSRP.  That was a gesture that I really appreciated.  Naji, the General Sales Manager, would stick his head in a couple of times during the process and say hi.  He knew he had a good team and let them do their jobs, but just wanted to say hi.  I liked his style.   Charlie worked the numbers during the finance stage and educated me on the extended warranty and maintenance packages.  I had already done some research ahead of time and was very pleased with his knowledge and his numbers.  Without my even asking, Charlie gave me a couple of nice breaks on the tinting and maintenance. Charlie had a lot of experience in the industry (>15yrs), was very personable, and clearly was happy to be at First Texas Honda.  Alex then took me out to my wife's new car, showed me some of the regenerative braking features in the parking lot,  and helped get the iphone and all the settings configured.  This effort was greatly appreciated and just another nice touch.   We're very happy with the Clarity and First Texas Honda.   I know they will take care of my family in the years to come.   I highly recommend this team and thoroughly enjoyed working with each of them.   ",5.0

819,"September 04, 2018","I began this transaction online while just looking into the possibility of trading in my 2016 Honda Odyssey and upgrading. I just wanted to see what it would look like on paper. I went with First Texas Honda because of a prompt and accommodating (I requested text vs phone calls) response to my internet inquiry by Emily Upton and prompt follow ups to my responses. I went in to discuss and from the get go a felt taken care of and treat as a serious buyer even though I was really indecisive. Alex Herrera was tied up but greeted with me with a smile, explained the situation and got me set up with Aaron Garcia he said he worked with to co-sell. Aaron was very friendly and relaxed and walked me through all my options, and really accommodated my indecisiveness. He happily walked around (on an extremely hot Texas day I might add) showing me multiple colors, and trims of the same 2019 Odyssey just because i wanted to see all my options. Even after we had explored all the options, and test drove the 2019, he showed not even an ounce of frustration  at all when I changed my mind at the very last minute and decided to look at a 2018 Elite which I  ended up going with in the end. He ran the numbers again and showed me the comparison. At that point I was 100% happy with my decision on the van and we moved forward. 
I then dealt with Kristen Hiller, who was very personable to work with. She help me navigate through the recommendations for the options and very the reasons for her suggestions. She was both straightforward and willing to explain details to me, with no feeling of being rushed. 
To sum this up. I was in the dealership a while on a very busy weekend (Labor Day) with a very indecisive disposition, but the team of people I dealt with made me feel like I had all the time I needed to make sure I was absolutely happy with my decision and my investment. I have continued to get great service with prompt email responses to questions after the sale. Over all its been a great experience. 
The only thing I would have done different is looked at the accessory options earlier in my visit. Perhaps looked at some floor model examples of the accessories. I say this,  as after a long sales decision your a little mentally not to mention financially worn out to start thinking of extra bells and whistles. Still their team helped me narrow down what they would recommend and made it work for me.

They also just handled a recall concern super promptly and provided a new loaner overnight while the work was done.  Also appreciate the weekend service hours. They make the whole service experience easy.

I'll wax on a moment about my Odyssey.  I consider myself a car guy and bought the Odyssey as a third car to fill the function of a trip car, a grandkid carrier, and a stuff hauler.  What was surprising is that the van is so easy to drive around town, that I usually prefer to drive it over my other daily driver, a car guys kind of car.  And on a trip, it's a hands down winner.  Comfy, safe, roomy, and one can haul back a treasure or two.

Sadly, I was given a new Odyssey to drive while getting my recall fixed, and it's an even better driving car than my 2019.  My 2014 has just 35K miles, so it will have to be while.  I guess.

I limped her back to Austin, and Jay was waiting for me. Just seeing him gave me so much relief, as I was stressed out to the max. I wasn't even sure I was going to make back to Austin. Jay had already arranged a terrific loaner, and assured me that he would stay on top of my car's diagnosis, keeping me informed along the way. Jay went even a step further, reaching out to corporate on my behalf, further strengthening my trust and loyalty. Needless to say, I was completely satisfied, and I was treated more than fairly.

I was 20 minutes early, so they made it clear from the get go that I would have to wait 20 minutes to get checked in. Nevermind that it's hotter than hades outside, you have to sit in your car and keep it running (NOT good for the environment folks). I would have preferred to go in  and wait, but that's not kosher. So I called a friend and chatted while I waited. When I saw AJ approach the car, I disconnected my call and opened the door. Only to have him tell me that he was going to check someone else out. And I was like, ""Why would you tell me that?"" Seriously, why would you waste my time?  Well, it seems AJ wasn't too thrilled at my response and went to get the assistant manager, Jeremy.

Thanks to Jeremy, my visit took a definite turn for the positive. After that, I got to go inside and wait. Which was really all I wanted in the first place. I just didn't want to sit and burn gas. It's not economical and it isn't good for the environment. Jeremy walked me through the process and I did express my concern to him that the service process has changed every single time I've had my oil changed and I've only had the car for 20 months. He at least listened to my concerns, and I appreciated it. As far as time for service, the car was done faster than promised  and they even washed it! That was unexpected and it made me happy because I've needed to wash it for a few weeks now and haven't had the time. The wait wasn't bad and at least there are beverages to sip on while you wait.

Getting used to all these new features is a little over-whelming, but I know that any questions or service I need will be answered promptly because I'll  always be treated at First Texas as long-time and forever Honda owner and friend. Thanks to Gregory and all the staff who assisted me...I look forward to my next visit already!!",5.0

It was originally purchased through Howdy Honda and I had brought the car in a few months later letting them know that the A/C doesn't blow cold about 30% of the time.  They had looked at it and found ""no problems"". This was November 2016. 

Since it was fall going into winter, I didn't notice the problem was still there until May 2017. I took it in for an oil change at Howdy Honda and explained my A/C problem to one of the service managers.  He thought it might be the relay, so he replaced it, no charge or change.  

On Friday April 27th at 1pm, I explained my ongoing issue with Aaron Yiu and he offered to have the car looked at and a free loaner vehicle since it was going to take at least 24 hours.  He called me later that day and let me know that there INDEED was a problem with the A/C and found metal particles in the A/C hoses and low pressure.  They replaced the compressor and hoses under warranty and for the last 3 ""hot"" days now, it has worked flawlessly!

I'm a loyal customer to First Texas Honda, so I figured I should be able to ask for some sort of discount. Thankfully I was painlessly given a 10% discount, however I feel I may have been able to ask for a bit lower, but I was very pleased by their willingness without any push back.

Anthony was tremendously helpful throughout making sure I was taken care of with a loaner vehicle for a few days (brand new 2018 Honda Civic), even when my car was finished he patiently let me keep the loaner because I had recently lost my debit card and was waiting for my debit card to come through (my credit card had been used in the meantime and available credit was less than the repair -- I ended up being able to raise my credit line for free with Discover). I also feel like Anthony was very personable -- he responded to all of my questions with patience, he gave me time to think over my decision on whether or not to repair, and shared what he would do if in my position.

Also, I somehow often run into AJ when I need to get regular car service (oil changes, etc.) and he is a great, friendly and helpful employee as well.

I don't doubt that First Texas Honda is at a bit of a premium in terms of cost but I am paying for good customer service, trustworthy diagnosis and informed service repair, and I feel like they bring that with smiles.

I expect this type of sales tactic from Joe's auto world - but not First Texas.  I am floored that these lies were perpetrated.  I will never lease from them again.  In fact, I'm looking at getting out of this car asap.  It took 8 months to realize how horrible this dealership is!",1.0

My objection isn't so much with this dealer as with Honda. They need to come up with a way to rebate the dealers in this kind of situation so the the customer isn't so ridiculously overcharged for options they don't want or need.

All of the american brands' mid to full size sedans, Hyundai, Nissan, Mazda, Toyota, Mercedes, BMW, VW, Audi, and on and on...countless hours because I was looking for a change.  Even though I had test driven an Accord Coupe the year before, I wasn't convinced and definitely wanted a change.

There was some communication issues at the beginning of my car buying with First Texas.  The week prior to my arrival to purchase the car, everything was completed online so in actuality, I should have spent no more than an hour.  I was there over 2.  Although I got a deal on the vehicle, I still got hustled for some bogus $600 charge for a paint coating to protect against sap.  Really?  I stated that I live in New Orleans (I flew to Austin for this car mind you and still didn't get airport to dealership reimbursement as I was promised). The reply from the financing lady was ""Well, the coating is already on there"".  Again....Really?  

I will recommend Kevin as a salesperson to deal with but not so much First Texas Honda. If I didn't have to pay my cab fare to the dealership and not get STIFFED $600, then it would be a different story in regards to recommendation.

I knew I would be able to trust Gregory to help me make a good choice.  His title is product specialist, and the title fits him to a ""T.""  He made the selection fun and enjoyable.  When the day arrived to ""seal the deal,"" Gregory arranged transportation for me to First Texas Honda. Corey was a delightful chaffeur.  When I arrived at First Texas Honda, Gregory had the car ready to go.  Cres Celestino, finance manager, had the papers ready to sign, and he was wonderful and patient answering my many questions.  Bottom line...First Texas Honda provided topnotch quality service in every area - reception, coffee bar, sales, service, shuttle, etc.!",5.0

1358,"August 20, 2017","This was my 2nd time buying a new car but the experience was nothing like the 1st one. I was attended to by few folks which all made this trade happen!

Liz was very helpful along the way including test driving the actual unit along-side my family (3 kiddos!). My wife and I found minor scratches on the dash and she immediately offer/checked out the 2nd available unit (luckily same trim; color int/ext). She offered us the time to check and make sure that we are getting what we are about to pay for. Very friendly, always offering for any refreshments. They have a great coffee bar!

Jason was honest, direct and worked out a deal which IMO is win/win. He valued my trade-in car within my expectations and he didn't have to go back and forth massaging numbers which I experienced first hand from other dealers.

Jordan the finance officer was a pleasure to do business. This is the part where some buyers would go scratching their heads on the way back thinking I got robbed. That was never the case for me. She did presented several add-ons and why I should take them. Great info, with real life experiences; not pushy but she will leave you thinking. They were able to beat my pre-approved APR! 

Carlos who was our last stop was very patient showing the car operations especially with lots of features that we didn't have from our 1st car. Glad he took the time, my wife was very pleased!

Overall, this was an excellent experience! My kids got to say goodbye to Humphrey (CX-5 GT) for the last time and Liz walked us out and shook hands, very professional...

1369,"August 03, 2017","When you visit the First Texas Honda (FTH) website to research vehicles you can also ""research"" the staff, from mechanics to administrators to baristas to salespersons. Each has a photo with interesting biographical details and even in some cases a short video in which they're clearly encouraged to let their personality shine through. This tells you all you need to know about the dealership--both that they want to provide such information and that it's not corporate, marketing packaging. Car buying today is far more customer-driven because so much information is available to buyers before you walk in. So the deal-maker is more likely to be the buying experience rather than simply price.

What's striking about the FTH staff is their eclectic backgrounds, interests, and personalities. Talking with them is more a conversation than a negotiation. They are not stereotypical one-dimensional swarmy fast talking hucksters. 

In the past 15 months our family has bought three vehicles here. For the first two I did the usual thorough research and exhaustive comparisons among the four Austin-area dealers, only to find that all four ended up with offers within a few dollars of each other. As a ""no haggle"" dealership, FTH was the only one whose initial offer was very close to what the other three eventually ended up at. No games--just a truly reasonable initial offer. So for the latest purchase I was confident enough to simply return to the sales staff I knew and had forged a relationship with. We chatted about what we needed, looked at three models and trim lines, took a drive, and did the deal.

You will meet interesting people here who are straight shooters and who will still be there when you service the car or come in to shop for another.",5.0

He came after a while and said there were no cars to test drive and the one he had sold just before I came. I knew he was lying because in my last email I happened to mention that I was not trading in my car but selling it to a private party. I immediately knew that he wanted to make money off my trade plus his commission and therefore it would not profit him to sell to me. One thing is for sure -- with 3 other Honda dealers in Central Texas I will never buy a car from this dealership. They were much better when they were on Koenig Lane --our family's first two new Hondas -- in 1994 and 1995 -- were bought from them at that location.

I am a large person and need a full sized sedan or small SUV to fit me and my wife it the front.  In addition I wanted space for my wife's purse and most vehicles have a solid console that comes down and completely separates the driver and passengers seats.

I visited CarMax, Toyota, Carvana and VW.  In all cases they didn't show me anything workable.  All I achieved was wasting time while they searched keys and tried to remember their own inventory.

I finally contacted First Texas Honda and discussed my needs.  I went up the next day and the first one they showed me fit my needs PERFECTLY.  Right color, right size, right everything.  The salesman offered and showed me other cars that would work but suggested the original one as the best fit, even though it was the cheapest one (yes, the salesman recommended the least expensive one).

Our Hondas have been carefully maintained and serviced regularly and give us great reliability and comfortable rides in a gas-conserving vehicle that retains its value far longer than most vehicles.  We drive our Hondas as long as possible--replaced our 1982 in 1995 after it was totaled by a March 25 Austin hailstorm; kept the 1995 Honda until it was totaled in the March 25, 2005 hailstorm.  We are still driving and enjoying our 2005 Honda Accord after 12 years.  Wish we could afford to add a rear view camera to our Honda.  Such longevity and reliability with our Hondas is surely related to the good mechanical service provided by First Texas Honda technicians.  Of course, as the car owners, it is our responsibility to make sure our Hondas receive the regularly schedules maintenances which we do without fail. Surely would be nice to be rewarded with an add-on rear view camera for being a dedicated customer for 35 years.

Brian Brown is an old family friend that has moved from Honda to Subaru, so he referred me to Ryan when I contacted him.
Couldn’t have asked for a better experience.

After a less than stellar experience at a Nissan dealership to evaluate a Rogue, I contacted Ryan and met at the showroom.
Very professional; provided all the info requested; knew the right questions to ask to qualify his prospect without being obnoxious; and followed up as he should without being obtrusive, Very responsive and accountable.

Evaluated the info overnight and upsold ourselves and called the next morning to confirm the order. Picked it up the same afternoon.

We probably spent $5k +/- more than we would have initially intended, and worth every penny.

I just wanted to share our experience with buying our new Honda Pilot.

First of all, we met John Garza a couple of months ago, when we were not happy with the Acura MDX services and decided to look into Honda Pilot.

John was extremely knowledgeable, he gave us answers  to every question we had.
We postponed our purchase till the begging of November, till the day 2017 model was released.
It took us a while to get the color and the model we wanted( we had our hearts set on  grey exterior with black interior), and John made sure we got it.
He is a perfect sales representative and a true expert, and we give him A++.
You should use John as an example for other sales reps.

We also met Jordan English. She was great, and she noticed that we were  the type of people, that if you push, we pull, so she didn't.  I don't know how she explained to us things, but we got a warranty, which we said, we would not get. Another great member of  First Texas Honda team.

Jordan and John make a great team,  work efficiently, and made our experience smooth and easy.

We would like to pass our Thanks to Carlos, he was great explaining and showing the features of our new car.

I really appreciated that because I would have had to re-arrange my work schedule.",5.0
1499,"November 28, 2016","I should wait and write this review when I have more time, but I don't want to let the opportunity pass to share my endorsement of this young man and the team around him at First Texas Honda.  I happened upon considering the Honda Pilot only because we picked up our packets for the 2016 Turkey Trot in the back of the dealership.  I was in the market when we stopped by, though I was pretty much decided that I would be trading in my Ford for another Ford.  I was just waiting for the 2017 (with Apple CarPlay) to arrive before making the purchase.

My first visit to the dealership had me curious to learn more about the cars, because I kinda wanted to do business with the dealer.  The entire staff is friendly, welcoming and seem genuinely happy to be there.  The dealership is unique and inviting compared to all the others I've visited in the region (and over the past decade I've bought 8 cars locally for my wife and myself.)

While that first visit had me curious, I was still planning to stick to my plan.
But, I stopped in to more seriously explore the Pilot before I made my purchase from Ford.  First Texas Honda was very busy that day, so the sales person I originally met when I picked up my Turkey Trot packet, was delivering two cars and I got paired up with Jorge.  We were like each other's ""leftovers"" on the day before Thanksgiving.  I was expecting to deal with someone else, and he probably hoped to be working with someone who MIGHT actually buy a car from him. 
 I told him pretty quickly that I was just checking out an alternative option before making my Ford purchase.  I also told him that I wanted the 2017 model (if at all) to get Apple CarPlay.  (note: every other dealership I talked to except one --and I visited four in the past couple months-- disregarded this key feature I was after and tried to push vehicles that they had in inventory.  First Texas Honda listened to me.  It was awesome.)

Even though I had to have seemed like a waste of time (they didn't have the vehicle I wanted and I was heavily leaning toward buying another Ford), Jorge cheerfully got to know me, my wants, chatted about the car and indulged my every question.  He was candid when he didn't know an answer, and we learned together.  This is a fundamental component of a pleasant shopping experience-- that both parties be real with each other.  I can't stand ""salespeople."" 
We spent a good amount of time together looking at the 2016, and I was seriously considering waiting for the 2017 Pilot.  I was going to have some serious soul searching to do... and I was really loving the dealership enough that if all else was equal, I was probably going to buy my first ever Honda.

When we both discovered later in the day that the 2017s had JUST arrived, it seemed like fate.  Within a few hours, the dealership prepped the Pilot, and I went home that night a new member of the First Texas family.
For the same price I would have paid, I am driving a more upscale vehicle, and I have a new relationship with a dealership that makes me feel welcome and appreciated.

Plus- the cold brew at the coffee bar is absolutely delicious!! I can't wait for my first scheduled service :-) 

Thanks Jorge!  
Cheers!

I highly recommend anyone looking for a Honda to visit this place - you won't go to another.

1508,"October 04, 2016","Our returning experience with First Texas did not go very well.  We had an issue with the brakes on our 2015 CRV and were told by Tim McIntosh that Honda approved for us to get brake shims on our vehicle. So they asked for us to bring the vehicle down to replace all four brake shims.  Now, when we came down to drop off our vehicle, they gave me a sheet of paper that had an explanation of why brake squeal occurs but there was no explanation of what cause “premature brake squealing.”  I would understand if a vehicle had over 45K miles for brake squealing, but beginning at 12K and persisting at 18K regardless of the remedies that are attempted.  Well, they had our vehicle over the weekend and I was contacted late Monday that my vehicle was ready.  I was told that everything was done with the vehicle and it was ready to be picked up.  Not once was I told they were not able to order the brake shims.  I was under the impression that the brake shim repairs were done. The one thing that really pissed me off was that they lied to us and broke my trust.  I really gave them the benefit of the doubt in trying to rebuild a relationship with the dealership after finding out that several well-respected individuals left the organization.  I felt there was no one there that I could trust.  Now, they have confirmed that they do not know how to tell the truth and you can’t even trust them to repair your vehicle or even tell you that they can't repair your vehicle.  However, they found it very convenient to tell me that they couldn’t order the parts when I was ready to pick up my vehicle after being under the impression that new parts would be on my vehicle.  All he needed to do was pick up the phone as soon as he was aware to let me know something happened and they were no longer able to proceed with the repair order as they originally planned.  Even when I spoke to him several times before picking up the vehicle... but they continued with the lie thinking we wouldn’t notice and that we would be okay with them greasing up the brakes - again and roughing up the brake pads - again.  You know, I would have given them credit if they said something like, ""My apologies, our parts are imperfect and no matter how many times we grease them up, turn the rotors and rough up the brake pads, unfortunately, you will still have premature brake squeal because our parts are defective and sub-par.""  But no credit is necessary, because they did not step up to the plate and show some honesty … they continued in perpetrating the lie.  All it would have took was a phone call to be truthful and not wait until I pick up my vehicle to find out that the so-called work that was promised was not done.  
We used to be a die-hard Honda family. However, I no longer want to be in my vehicle knowing that Honda does NOT stand by their vehicles and the dealerships who service Honda’s customers are bold-faced deceptive liars because their quality is not what it used to be and they make up excuses as to why there parts fail.  I understand if a vehicle is old and will have some brake squeal, a sign of old age.  However, a vehicle that is a little over 1 year old with 18K miles should NOT be squealing the way that it does.  Customer service at First Texas is not what it used to be.  We will never come back there for anything.

I requested information online and was connected to a sales consultant the next day. Needless to say Ryan Blazic was pleasant to deal with via email and answered my questions via email before I got to the test drive. He was very approachable and gave me the feeling that he cared about and would work with my needs and concerns. I worked in Sales management a long time ago and service matters the most to me. If you work in the service industry, that is what your priority should be to customers. Ryan earns a 5 star with his knowledge of the product, service and attitude to a customer. I have seen people in sales who like to make up answers. Ryan consulted with his coaches on what he was not familiar with. He worked with me on the details of the numbers and introduced me to his colleagues who were pleasant and helpful in my decisions. Never felt rushed or pressured during the visit. Needless to say, I ended up driving home in the vehicle I came to test drive. I usually do not make decisions or pull the trigger on a purchase like that without discussing with my significant other, but what was offered was too good to pass on.  Ryan's attention to detail is what mattered the most to me from the time I stepped on the lot at First Texas Honda, to the time we stepped into our new vehicle and took off.

I received better than median value for my trade in (which was more than $1000 higher than my carmax estimate) and their up front quoted price for the new 2016 Odyssey was actually $500 less than their dealer cost(not just invoice). Assuming that I probably couldn't get a better price, I still did my due diligence and shopped around and went to some other dealers and was turned off by their negotiating as they simply wanted to know what my current offer was so they could try to beat it. One did try to undercut by a few hundred dollars, but when I took my business back to First Texas, they were happy to meet that price with no fuss. I probably would not have gotten a good offer from another dealer without my one from First Texas Honda in hand. Thank you very much to salesperson Michele Anthony and Team Leader Christian Mancheno.

The price was reasonable for high-quality materials and work covered by a lifetime warranty. I was well-briefed by Teresa on proper care to keep the window tint in best condition, and I also read the instructions on the manufacturer's warranty card.

1555,"March 07, 2016","Before the recent ""regime"" change, service at First Texas was pretty good.  As a former customer, our concerns were not questioned or responded to as being questionable.  While the customer was always right, if there was something that could not be done, it was communicated in such a way that did not make the customer feel as though their concerns were not important.  We were made to feel as though we were a part of the family.  Now ... that feeling is no longer there and we feel like outsiders.  Assumptions about the type of service we are requesting before we completely describe what our concern is.  The remaining service advisors do not practice ""active listening.""  They believe that their many years of experience is more valuable instead of the listening to customers' full concern.  I would have recommended this dealership, but I don't believe it has the right staff to continue the feeling of ""family"" that it used to have.",1.6

1577,"October 27, 2015","I used this dealership for scheduled service through the warranty period on a 2013 Accord EX-L 4-cylinder. When I went to perform my first oil change warranty end, there was not even oil on the dipstick. I suspected at first that they did not change the oil at all on the last service. Now closely monitored, I see the vehicle consuming 3/4 quart or more for every 30% of the oil life. That means every time I took the car in for service it had no oil on the dipstick. Either they hid the issue or do not have a diligent service program. I was left in the dark about this issue, and now the car is out of warranty. They never offered to investigate the issue. For comparison, I can run my Toyota Tundra on the same synthetic oil for a full year with no loss. Friendly smiles never replace honesty, and I feel scammed.

UPDATE: The dealer Service Director contacted me immediately after posting this review. He offered to provide an oil consumption test despite the car being out of warranty, and that test is now underway. Although this issue should have been found in regular service, at least they are trying to make good on the situation. Ultimately, Honda will need to decide whether or not the issue will be corrected as warranty repair. It will be several thousand miles before the test is concluded, so situation still TBD. In the meantime, I've raised scores to reflect the dealership willingness to work on the issue.",3.8

We'd agree to a price, and half an hour later get a call that another accessory had been added and the price went up.  It was super stressful!

And that's just what we did!  Aaron was laid back, answered all of our questions, walked us through the entertainment and Bluetooth functions, and not once did he try to sell us on anything we didn't want.

I had high expectations going in, and they not only met them, they exceeded them. 
A lot of people hate buying a car because of the tactics used by large corporate dealerships, and the haggling necessary. It's stressful and frankly annoying. Since most people feel this way support a dealership with a business model that avoids this. Unless people support dealerships with these different business models the process will never change. That being said everyone I came across at this dealership went out of their way to be friendly and helpful. So now I have a dealership with a business model I support with extremely friendly and helpful employees.

However, after my purchase is when I encountered problems with First Texas Honda. A navigation disk was supposed to be ordered. After a week and a few unreturned calls to them, it still had not been ordered.

I have now had my car for two-and-a-half weeks, and I still don't have the disk. Nor do I have an answer to WHEN I will have it.

1648,"June 09, 2015","I was at First Texas Honda to get an oil change on my Accord. They also recommended a tire rotation, which I agreed to. The employee at the desk calls me about an hour later and says one tire has a puncture that is repairable for $24.95 and that the mechanic pulled my engine air filter and the cabin air filter and they were dirty  and needed to be replaced. I ask to see the tire and get taken into the mechanic bay where the mechanic working on my car explains that it is not repairable due to the proximity to the tire wall. I understand that, but what I don't understand is the phone call telling me that it was repairable. While I was there I decided to ask the mechanic about the filters, whether or not they could wait since I now had to buy a new tire. The mechanic then asked the service desk employee if that was recommended for the miles on my car,  the service desk employee says yes.  So the mechanic decides to check the air filters while I'm standing there.  The cabin air filter was pretty bad and he recommended that be changed as soon as possible.  He then checked the engine air filter and said it did not need to be changed at this time,  maybe do it at the next oil change instead. I understand that at certain miles extra things may pop up that need to be checked.  But why lie about it and say the mechanic pulled the filters and they were dirty and needed replaced?  Why not just say,  we recommend these things be changed at these miles? I feel like the service desk employee lied to me. Overall, I will go back because I feel that the mechanic was honest and reliable. ",3.8

I was looking at one of the vehicles this dealership had for sale. Since it is a 30 minute drive for me, I decided to call and inquire about the vehicles and the condition it was in. They were quick to respond and even sent me a Carfax when I first emailed them, but I wanted to get more details. When I called, Melisa had another employee look at the car, who called me back at told me the car was in great shape and no noticeable damage or poor fixes. Happy, I decided to schedule an appt.
I show up and am greeted by friendly staff who are aware of what is going on and even offer me water or coffee. Already better than 99% of any Ford or GM dealership, I might add. After I get with the person whom I am scheduled to meet with, this is when things go sour: the actual car.
The first thing I notice as we are walking up is that one of the headlights is faded and the other is new. Poor repair job right here, as no respectable shop would let a car go out with mismatched headlights (buffing it and recoating it is a simple matter and it makes your shop's work look better). Not only that, but this glaringly-obvious mismatch should have been disclosed to me on the phone when I asked. Continuing on, I found that the right door was misaligned and replaced, all of the weatherstripping was cracked and needing to be replaced, the windshield was a cheap aftermarket one and was actually separating on the edges, the interior was in terrible shape, there was clear coat fade in several spots, the engine bay panels were covered in that terrible shine spray and they were all loose. Then the inside only got worse. The buttons were faded, the plastic on the gauges was scratched and faded, the dash was melting and sticky(this is a common issue with Nissan, Toyota, and Lexus), the leather was in bad shape, etc. Basically, the car was poorly maintained and shoddily repaired. I think a blind man would be able to identify the flaws in this car.

The test drive revealed that at least one wheel bearing was shot and that was it. I'd say they overpriced the car by at least $3,000.

I was looking for a car to buy my son for his 18th birthday.  They found a perfect match and what was even better, they were able to establish a loan with my son name on it.  

Thanks to Jeanie, Christian, Tyler and Chris for making my son's 18th birthday even more exciting.

AND the coffee, WOW they have good coffee, really good coffee.  I ate breakfast there and they invited me to do it everyday if I like.  I wish I could take them up on that.

There is a warmth and/or family feeling you get just walking in the store.  Much like a small ""mom & pop"" business that you just know, they have the customers best interest first.

They stuck with me when it looked like I had missed out on it as someone else was buying it, but that fell through and it went to me. As I'm a first timer, they were excellent in explaining how the financing works and helping me get a fair loan for my situation.  I got the exact car I wanted at a fair price and with reasonable financing. This was without a doubt, the best purchasing experience of my life.

Two oil changes..but no sticker put on the window shield. This last oil change was not done right at all....actually the oil was not changed..After three weeks husband had checked the oil....it was very very dirty and extremely low. He had to put new oil in to replace what was NOT there.  Can you imagine your car not having any oil in it....mine had hardly any and it was dirty. On top of that, a guy in sales called me to see if i wanted to sell my car..If I wanted to sell it...I would have. I dont need anyone to suggest that. Im very very dissatisfied. Ive bought two Honda Elements from them...I love my cars. Their mechanics are dishonest..I do have their names. Id rather go to Jiffy Lube for an oil change....but If i do, Ill stand over them and watch what they do to my car. I could've had an engine malfunction..what car operates on no oil in it??? Thankfully my husband checked.  Not a happy customer...although I was at one time..Thats not right..

I brought my vehicle in for a standard oil change, break pads, and tires.
I took the shuttle to and from work, traffic aside it was late because the driver was given the wrong address.
Then I was never called to let me know my vehicle was ready.
When I called, no one ever called me back. Wait when I walked in the door to pick it up then the service guy called to see if it was ready.
I asked 3 times to have my vehicle washed which was not done.
They did not stamp my card toward an oil change, instead I was just shuffled out the door.
When I got in my car I notice right away something was off.
After calling 5 different people did a lady in sales, who wanted my business, actually help get someone to call me.
It turns out that my new tires were defective.
Seriously who does that, and puts me out on the street in an unsafe vehicle.
After a week does my car finally get brought into the dealership to get fixed.
So a week and a half later when I picked up my car, It looked like someone had been hanging out in my car as they left their reading material in my backseat for my kids to find. Not good.
I was promised all sorts of freebies and serivces which I never recieved.
Unless you have time and money to waste, keep going this it the worst service you will ever recieve!!

She held the keys at her desk while I drove down from Dallas and told me if the car had any of the specific damage I was inquiring about (scratches, repainted parts) First Texas Honda would not be selling the car. Convinced this was my perfect car, I was extremely excited, I envisioned myself driving all the way back home in my new car. When we got to the dealership, we were introduced to Jacob who helped us from there on. When we got to the car, my heart dropped, this was NOT the car I expected, it was covered in damage; from the giant scraped body bumper guard to the back bumper/lift gate scratches, to the discoloration on the drivers mirror, to the stress fracture on the front bumper and last but not least, the back bumper had obviously been repainted as there were over-spray paint drips. I could not believe I had been lied to, the car would come with an additional repair cost. During the test drive, we found that the sunroof had a tendency to get stuck so that would have to be replaced as well. 

At the end of my experience with First Texas Honda, we were told because they're ""upfront & honest"" according to TrueCar, they would not be able to negotiate a better price for the bunch of lies they fed me over the phone.

They also made me very comfortable in the fact that they will be of any help even after the sale, if for any reason that I may need their assistance again, they are there for me.

Actually, I already have. My boss at work is soon to be needing a new car for her husband. I told her how great my experience was & what a great deal we got with your $750 discount this month for buying a new car & the great 0.9% interest that we received! hopefully she & her husband can take advantage of that as well.

1812,"January 06, 2014","Comments to dealership:

I am disappointed to leave such a negative report, but my experience with your dealership stands in stark contrast to the positive experiences I have at every other business in Austin. I am in the middle of a life crisis. I had to leave my home of 7 years, replace my car and all of my belongings, and find a new place to live within a short time span. I have never felt so taken advantage of as I do by my experience buying this car. Had I been treated this way at any other point in my life I would have walked away, but I did not have the luxury of time.

1) Lack of engagement and empathy: From the moment I walked in the door, the salesman, John, clearly communicated with his non-verbals that didn't want to sell to me because I was buying a used car, but he worked with me because no one else was available. He showed no empathy for my situation even when I shared it with him - he didn't even respond or comment at all. Not even an ""I'm sorry to hear that."" Every other employee I have interacted with at a business in the Austin area, from the hotel I've been staying at to the minimum wage clerks at the grocery and drug stores, has had at least a word of comfort and caring when they have learned of the challenges I am facing. When I asked about the $25 gift card on the website while waiting during the paperwork of buying the car he said I could print it off and he would honor it. This is after I had already agreed to buy a car, financed by your dealership - I was stunned that he was so unwilling to be helpful and so emotionally closed off.
2) Pressure: I was clear from the beginning that I was pre-approved by my bank, that I intended to buy an older Honda Civic or similar in the next 48 hours to replace mine, and that I wanted an overview of what was available. I said I wanted to spend $5-15k, and preferred to stay on the low side and that I wanted something that would hold it's value for 6 months because I'll be moving to a city that is not very car-friendly and I would have to sell it. He pressured me into telling him how much my bank approved me for ($20), then started telling me about the available cars in the $12-15k range. I said I would like to start at the low end and work up, and had to ask several times to learn about cars under $10k. He wouldn't just show me the computer screen or outline what was available, he just kept suggesting cars at the top of my price range.
3) Responsiveness: He was responsive and answered my calls and was able to reschedule when I was off schedule (from signing a lease for a new place to live). He also called me when another client came in to purchase a car unplanned and he needed to adjust his appointment with me. I appreciated that at least, but nothing else about my experience could possibly be framed positively.
4) Lack of transparency: Though he did make sure I saw the scratches on the car in the daylight before buying it, several things were not transparent. For example, I have a 725 credit score, and was pre-approved with my bank, but the car I bought had higher mileage than my bank would accept. I was willing to finance through you, but I received no information about that process. He literally would not tell me which bank my loan would be with. If you look at several different banks, why didn't I see several different loan offers - one from each bank? He also could not explain why my interest rate was so high, and tried to compute simple interest to show me that the difference between my bank's interest (2.7%) and the one he was offering (6.7%) would only be a total of $1000 over the month of the loan ($5/month). I am insulted that he would think I don't know how compounded interest works. I used a bankrate.com calculator on my phone in front of him to show him that the difference would be a few thousand dollars and $40/month. Insulting. It concerns me to know that people from our community in much worse/more permanent situations than me would not even know the difference and would take on more debt than they can afford. I am ashamed to have you operating in our community.
5) Outright dishonesty: The worst part of the entire experience is how John reacted when saw that I had a lien on my car that I was trying to trade in. I bought that car with $4500 cash (actual dollar bills) in 2006 and have driven it without putting a lien on it since (of course, he had to insult me further by telling me that I must have bought it with a vehicle buyers check, though he just said, ""check from your bank that's the same as cash""). I am actually incredibly financially savvy, and have paid cash for every vehicle since this one because of the crisis I am in. I have also been divorced and couldn't find the title where I thought I had left it. So, when he said that there was a lien on it, I was shocked and said that it had to be a mistake. I asked if it could have been my ex-husband's truck coming up on my credit report, though that is already paid off, and he said he would check. He never gave me an answer either way and he never showed me the paper that outlined the lien. I asked what I needed to do to get a new title and he rattled off some directions on his way out of the room. I asked what would happen if I couldn't get it in time, and whether the 72 hours I was allowed to produce the title included the weekend. He said it would be enough time, that I could just go next week to the title office on Parmer Lane and pay $5 and they would give me a title right then and there. I asked what would happen if I went to the title office on Monday and they couldn't get me one in time or even at all. He said that it should be enough time, but that the trade in value would just be charged to my credit card. I should not have had to work so hard for that information. We proceeded with the purchase order and moved to the final paperwork with a sale price minus the $760 value of my trade in (yes, the one with the lien on it). Then, when signing the final paperwork with Nathan, I demanded to know what supposed lien was on my car or under my name so I could do something about it. Nathan was surprised and made a phone call, then called John in. Finally I demanded to see the paper they were referring to so I could see who thinks they own my car. It was the credit union I belonged to and had joint accounts in with my ex-husband, so there is actually a chance that they do have my title, though I still hope it's an error (I will be calling them first thing tomorrow morning). John was perfectly content to let me walk out the door without knowing that someone is reporting a lien on my car. He was happy, knowing the life crisis I am in, to send me on a wild goose chase to try to get a title for a car that someone is reporting a lien on, without even warning me that I was up for that battle. And he knew full well that I would not have the title back in time and you all would be charging my credit card in place of the trade in.

I am not sure what you can do to regain my trust, but I can assure you that I will be warning my many friends and colleagues not to visit your dealership. I loved the idea of a no haggle dealership. I have 3 brothers and every one of them works in a Toyota or Honda dealership and I wanted to brag to them about how awesome your business model is. It is bad enough that I have had to replace all of my belongings and start my life over, but being preyed on by a salesman at a local business, especially one that purports to be transparent and fair, really has hurt my faith in humanity. I feel betrayed and taken advantage of, not only as a purchaser of a vehicle, but as a long-time member of the Austin community, and as a human being. I will still be extremely busy during this transition time, but I switched my answer to ""yes"" I would like to speak with a manager because I felt like it was inappropriate to leave such scathing comments without being willing to speak with someone who could attempt to rectify the situation.",1.2

If their prices were higher than average with the no-haggle policy that would be one thing, but the car that I eventually bought from them was priced even lower than the ""fair market range"" on Kelley Blue Book, and that price was listed right on their website so I knew I was going to get a good deal before I even set foot in the store.",5.0

The guy not even show up to deliver my new accord and i have to deal with un-pleasant  people there.  

The bottom line from my experience with First Texas Honda are....
-lack of product knowledge
-unprofessional
-deliver body damaged vehicle without make you aware of the damaged
-my gas tank was near empty when i pickup
-after my purchased i have several minor amaged to my accord were...side window panels were cosmetic defect, the state inspection sticker was peel off from the windshield, the lane watch camera image is out of focus and rainy pixels (i brought the car in for the service and was told need to contact with the honda regional tech support) what the heck? and i was asked to bring again for them to compare.  At this point there is no solution or at least First Texas Honda make me feel that they are jack me around.  I am dealing the issues with Honda Corporate now waiting for the out come.  I just dont have time to play game with them.

1854,"January 21, 2013","I am impressed by Brittania's McNair's knowledge about the car I wanted and her sincere interest in getting me exactly what I wanted -- and nothing added on that I didn't want.  Once I choose the car, she kept me well informed about when my car would be available and didn't pester me with too frequent communication.  The whole approach to selling cars at First Texas is refreshing -- I wouldn't have put off shopping for a car so long if I'd known beforehand how much I'd enjoy the experience with them.  None of the bogus ""Well, I need to go see a manager"" stalling tactics -- I got the car I wanted at a great price with  good value for my trade-in and no irritating haggling.  I love my Civic and can't honestly say I've ever enjoyed the car-buying experience until First Texas!!  When you go, see Brittania -- she's a superstar!!",5.0
1855,"January 05, 2013","Honda was one of 3 cars that my husband and I were looking at to buy. I was very impressed with Winthrop and his professional, personal touch with the customer. He is very knowledgeable and assisted me in picking out just the right CR-V. He is humorous making the customer feel at home and not a pushy salesperson.  I will definitely recommend him to my coworkers, family, and friends.

1856,"December 19, 2012","I originally had gone to see Karl in the beginning of December and was completely sold on the car, the pristine condition it was in considering it was a used car. At the time it was my first dealership and test driving the vehicle and decided to keep looking. At the time, I had given up on the idea that I would purchase the car but 2 weeks later I returned and could not be any happier. I saved money on the car, Karl went above and beyond in helping me get financed and the whole package. I am extremely grateful and HIGHLY recommend this dealership. Merry Christmas to me and my 2007 Acura TL :)",5.0

1858,"November 25, 2012","Blair Brown thank you for your excellent and professional customer service and my wife loves her new car! I have never seen her so happy! First Texas Honda thank you for such a great salesman who made us feel welcome the second we walked into your doors. This guy is a asset to your company and we just could not ask for a better salesman. First Texas Honda means what they say when it comes to no haggle prices and we got my wife's car at exactly what we needed it at and we also got 0.9 interest rate with Honda finance and they gave us a excellent trade in value on our car. I will definitely be sending business your way. Sincerely, Blake and Tanya Godbey.",5.0
1859,"November 03, 2012","One of the worst experiences I've ever had at a Dealership! Theses people are snake-oil salesman.  What good is setting up an appointment to buy a vehicle when 5 minutes before you arrive for your appointment they call and tell you they've sold the vehicle to someone else. Then, they tell you they have other vehicles you might like. The old &quot;bait and switch&quot;. They love to push that they are a &quot;Family owned business&quot;.
I would hate to be a part of that family....",2.5
1860,"August 08, 2012","After totalling my first 2011 Fit (which saved my life), I had to come back to Honda and to Tyler to get a new one. How could I not, after being the safest car I've ever driven and the friendly and extremely helpful hand of Tyler. The whole agency seemed great tho but my sales guy made my car shopping experience extremely easy and pleasant.
Thanks First Texas Honda!",5.0
1861,"May 24, 2012",Linda was friendly and forthright. She sold me my 2012 Insight despite the fact that her boss didn't want to sell. I got an enormous trade-in on my 2006 Insight to boot so the price was below low.,5.0
1862,"April 12, 2012","I went to First Texas Honda because my family has bought cars from them for more than 20 years in total we have bought 5 cars from them. So I was trying to be loyal to a local company. I bought a new 2012 Honda Fit. 

Price, They say they are a no hassle dealership. That means you pay what everyone else at over dealerships pay. My opinion it's a joke to call your dealership no hassle really. I paid the same price as 3 other people who bought there Fit's at other dealerships. 

People, The people were nice by the most part. 2 things bothered me. The first was when I was signing all the paperwork. They try to get you to by protection plans. They try to make you feel like a idiot for not wanting it. But instead it made me feel like the Honda warranty did not cover anything. I read the warranty, don't believe the hype. I checked and the commission for this very high. I bought a Honda for the quality and they had me second guessing it in the final minutes. The second was they forgot to get me to sign a warranty form. I had to drive back, but it could have waited till my accessory appointment 3 days later.

Accessories, Honda accessories are way overpriced. The center console at the dealership was $450. I bought it online for $180 and installed it myself. Took 30 minutes. The dealer said it was expensive because you had to disable the airbag in the set to install. That is a lie. I found that most Honda accessories are 2 to 3 times the OEM price you can find on the web. My opinion is buy them online and install yourself. 

The Car itself, I love my car, the Fit is a great car for the money. My only complaint is with the detailing the dealership did when I had the window tinting done. They used way to much Armorall on the interior and tires. I spent a week wiping the oil off me and my interior. 

I am not saying my experience was bad, it just could have been a lot better and I expected a lot more from them. Before I bought this car I would have said we buy all our cars at First Texas Honda. Now I won't be as loyal. Just dissapointed ",3.4
1863,"December 18, 2011","I was just going to ""look"" at what Honda had for 2012 and found the right ""fit"" in a FIT! Andrew and Tyler knew everything there was to know about the Hondas and were professional and personable. I honestly felt they had my best interests in mind during the afternoon. That was a FIRST for me in a car buying experience.  The finance manager was awesome! I cannot believe that buying a car could be such a positive learning experience!",5.0
1864,"August 25, 2011","A seamless experience for a newbie buying a new car. 
The staff was friendly and I didn't feel forced into anything. They were very willing to help me get acquainted with the car when I bought it.",4.8
1865,"August 25, 2011","This was by far the easiest car buying experience I have ever had. I began my search on the internet. After perusing First Texas Honda's website, I determined that they had several cars, both new and used that interested me. I sent an e-mail inquiry and I was  put in touch with Justin. Justin was extremely personable on the phone and was willing to answer all of my questions.  When I met with him in person, he helped me narrow my focus, and we took a 2011 Fit for a test drive. Justin did a great job explaining all of the great features of this car. He was extremely knowledgable about Honda vehicles, and his enthusiasm was contagious.  After taking a test drive, I knew it was the car for me. The dealership's &quot;no haggle&quot; price strategy is very straightforward. I knew the price going in, and I didn't have to play any games. I took advantage of the very low interest rate offered by Honda, and I am now the owner of a really nice car!

I would also like to mention Jennifer Schull. She was brought in to give the dreaded obligatory spiel about all of the extra stuff that the dealership wants to sell in addition to the car. You can probably tell that I am not a fan of this portion of the car selling process. Well,  I have to say that Jennifer was amazing. She had a non b.s. approach that was truly refreshing. She explained all of the accessories and extras that I could add to car, if I so desired.  There was no pressure, and she made a compelling case for the items that were offered. I even bought a couple of things! Jennifer is a cool chick, and a real asset to First Texas Honda. ",5.0
1866,"August 24, 2011","I *highly* recommend this dealership.  I recently purchased a 2011 Honda Fit from First Texas Honda.  This is the second vehicle that I've bought from First Texas and I've been pleased with both the vehicles as well as the service that I receive from First Texas.  Their sales team provides great assistance without making the customer feel pressured to buy.  At no time did the sales associate try to up-sell needless accessories--which is a real plus in my book--nor did they try to play any games.  After the sale, First Texas continued to give outstanding service.  Their service team has consistently gone the extra mile to make sure that that my car is taken care of and I've always felt treated fairly.  Thanks y'all for making my car buying and maintenance experience a positive one.  I look forward to seeing y'all move into your new digs and will be bringing my Fit in the future.

Great Job!",5.0
1867,"August 19, 2011","I definitely would not recommend First Texas Honda for sales or service. While the buying experience was satisfactory, the salesman continuously reminded us of the ""free services"" that First Texas Honda provided. The salesman stated over and over that they would provide ""free oil changes for the life of the vehicle"". No caveats were stated by the salesman at that time. When we came back for our ""free oil change"" we were told that we would have to purchase another service to get the free oil change. They tried to sell us a tire rotation service (even though the vehicle had only 6,000 miles on it) for a ridiculous price. When I questioned Andrea, the General Sales Manager about this, she was very rude and condescending and stated that we signed a document that stated that the ""free oil changes"" came with the purchase of another service item. We did indeed sign this document during the 50 or so documents that we had to sign at closing but this was never reiterated in a way to insure that the customer understood. All we got from the sales staff was ""free oil changes"". Andrea also stated that this had been a problem in the past but that they had not addressed it yet. Andrea's attitude and lack of management skills ensured us that we would not be buying our next vehicle at First Texas Honda.

1868,"August 08, 2011","First Texas Honda has a no-haggle price policy where I didn't have the games of the salesperson going back and forth to the manager to make a deal.  The salespeople aren't paid on commission, so there is less stress in making a sale.  I enjoyed my experience at First Texas Honda and would recommend it to anyone.",5.0
1869,"July 29, 2011",I came into the store knowing exactly what I wanted and how much I wanted to pay. The buying process was very simple. The best part of our sale has been the service!

1870,"July 26, 2011","First Texas is a no-haggle dealership, so it's price on a Civic we recently bought was not the best I could find, but considering the purchase was for our daughter, the price was close enough to take advantage of First Texas being local and providing some maintenance incentives long term, such as some routine servicing for free. In the internet age, no-haggle isn't the incentive it used to be because it's relatively easy to shop price quickly. But First Texas is convenient and service-heavy. Representative Tyler Pelham was informative, candid, straightforward, responsive--and a pleasant guy! With Hondas in great demand, some dealers can easily dismiss customers with minimal attention, because the cars will move regardless. First Texas and Tyler got my commitment because it was important to have a dealer my daughter would trust and use.",4.8
1871,"June 30, 2011","My husband and first went to a Nissan Dealership to look at the Rogue. We bought an Altima from this same dealership two years ago, and expected to be treated with respect since we were repeat customers. This was not the case. We were treated horribly. We decided to go to First Texas Honda becasue I knew it was close by, and I wanted to check out the CR-V. My expectations were not very high, as I knew nothing about this dealership and just left another one feeling terrible. Joe was our salesman and he was able to knock the large chip off of my shoulder immediately. He explained the ""no haggle"" philosophy of their dealership, and it took an enormous amount of pressure off of us. He was kind and polite, and extremely knowledable about the vehicle. He made us feel like valued customers from the minute we walked in the door, and continues to make us feel like valued customers even after the sale. I am very happy with my purchase, and very happy with who we purchased from. As long as we live in the Austin area, First Texas Honda will be our dealership.",5.0

1873,"June 26, 2011","Examples of exceptional service include the no-haggle pricing, which really makes you feel like you are not getting ripped off, and prices were very competitive. We pointed out a few dings in the used car during our initial test drive, and the dealership repaired them without knowing we'd be back to purchase the car. Information about the cars they have available, including the CarFax and VIN, is available on their website, so we were able to do our research before we came to the dealership to test drive. I would definitely recommend this dealership to friends.",5.0

I knew exactly what I wanted- model, color, accessories.  Karl was helpful, explained everything and pointed out some things I hadn't thought of.  But he didn't try to pressure me into any decisions.  He knew about the FIt and was able to answer my questions and I was out of there with just what I wanted.

The other staff were very efficient & helpful.  I can see why they get the Chronicle Best of Austin award.

1877,"April 23, 2008","Be aware buyers.
I was looking for the new Honda accord coupe and I called them twice, asking if they had specific trim/color I wanted.(EX w/ black/black)
They told me they did and since none of the nearby dealers had it, I drove 30 miles to Austin. Guess what happened? haha
I met this guy, Chris who was on the phone w/ me and verified the availability of the coupe.
me: So, can I take a look?
chris: Sure, let me go grab the key.
After 5 minutes he comes back and tells me that he doesn't have it.
c: Oh I'm very sorry. I thought you meant LX. When I hung up the phone with you, I realized I was looking at the wrong car.
me: huh? Why didn't you call me back then?
c: well, you've told me you were on your way so I thought I could talk to you in person about it.

hahaha just ridiculous...I wasted another 30 minutes or so because he told me how beautiful silver cars were.so I said let's take a look. He comes back after 10 minutes and tells me they dont have it hahahahaha

IT was so ridiculous that I couldn't even get angery with him.
so any of potential buyers out there, plz ask them 3 times, if not 4 times, about they are saying. I ""only"" asked them twice so I wasted my time and gas ;) I ended up buying the desired trim/color from another dealer and I'm waiting for Honda to call me for a survey.
Guess what I'm gonna talk to them about? I hope it doesn't happen to other people...jesus...",2.0
