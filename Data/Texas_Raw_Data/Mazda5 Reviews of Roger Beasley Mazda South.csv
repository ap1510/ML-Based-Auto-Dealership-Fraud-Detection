.    I have bought 4 new Mazda in the last 30 years.  I always had good service and I love Mazda cars.  This time I really felt  lucky I had Josh Beck, best employee  of Mazda.  He treated with  courtesy and a smile.  He helped me to  understand , that car  buying is fun.  He acted  like he loves his job and his customer. He went out of his way  to make my car buying a pleasure.  I would recommend Mazda South to all my friednd",4.6
1,"December 06, 2018","Although the reason for my going to Mazda South was sad (total loss of my 2008 Mazda 6), I have nothing but positive things to say about my buying experience!  Sales rep, David Cantu, was the best sales person I've ever worked with! He was extremely knowledgeable, courteous, understanding, patient, prompt returning my many calls; did not pressure at all, just provided information I needed to make a decision on the Mazda 6 in which I was interested. 

Both David Cantu and Kendall Blyth, Financial Mgr., were a pleasure to work with!  Their customer service was beyond excellent!  I highly recommend these two employees and Mazda South!  

Also, the clean, comfortable, friendly environment of Mazda South was much appreciated!",5.0
2,"November 03, 2018","Gold Star to Mazda South Roger Beasley Group!  Scott Harms treated us like family, gave us expert advice and made our experience a pleasurable one.  He went out of his way to make sure he found the exact vehicle we wanted and offered us a good price.  His no pressure and serviced focused sales approach allowed us to make sure we were making the correct choice for our needs.  I normally don't give reviews but Scott was amazing and car shoppers need to know that car shopping doesn't have to be a stressful experience when you have the pleasure of working with someone like Scott Harms.",5.0

4,"November 24, 2017","I purchased a CX9 from here, and from the get go, Steve Borke was incredible. In fact, the entire dealership was. This is not a pushy dealership, they are honest and sincere. They do their best to make sure you leave happy. I can’t tell you how much this dealership went above and beyond to make sure I was happy with my car. My back began to hurt after I bought the car, and they worked with me to try and fix it. They very easily could have said “too bad so sad, you bought the car, so good luck.” I am so relieved that there is a dealership (and someone like Steve and Richard) who show folks like myself that there are still honest dealerships out there.
