4,"February 04, 2020",I had a pleasant experience with Demontrond Kia and GMC. No sales pressure and everyone was very friendly and knowledgeable.  Originally went to test drive a Kia and left in a new 2019 GMC Acadia ,4.0
5,"January 26, 2020",I purchased 2018 GMC Sierra brand new from Demontrond GMC. The truck is  right at 2 years old and I’m already having AC problems. I contacted the service dept and I was advised the warranty forever program doesn’t cover the Ac. This dealership is a ripoff. I will never purchase a truck here again.,1.0

8,"December 10, 2019",I bought My truck from this dealer 14 months ago. With the purchase came 2 free oil changes. I have called my Service Advisor and left messages with not return call. Not good practices if you ask my opinion. This is the 2nd time I have dealt with the same advisor and nothing has changed as far as getting a return phone call,1.5

10,"October 18, 2019","I contacted the salesman that was referred to me RAUL GARCIA to check to see if the vehicle that I was looking at online was still available. 
After confirming it was still available I made time to go out to take alook.
Since I was already preapproved by my bank I knew what I could afford.
I brought my trade in and after a few visits to the sales manager we were able to come up with a reasonable offer on my trade in.
Agreed on a price,told him ahead of time that I was not interested in any extras like extended warranty or GAP ect... and to let the finance manager that I wasn't interested so to please dont waste my time with trying to get me to bite.so needless to say I was in and out with my new truck in less than 2 hours and they honored all the rebates totaling about $14000.
Plus Demontrond is the only dealer that offers lifetime warranty. 
So go see RAUL GARCIA at demontrond! ",5.0
11,"August 03, 2019","We don't keep cars very long ... they're not worth any more than they are right now, and frequent turnover allows us to drive the newest and best, without the restrictions of leasing. Once the '20 GMC Terrains came out, we began the hunt for a leftover '19 Denali. With a $10k incentive off sticker, and sales being slow, now seemed the time to strike. We located a vehicle at DeMontrond, verified its availability, and drove a bit, only to be informed that it had been sold the previous evening ... not a big deal, happens all the time. About two hours later, we received a call from our original contact, advising us that the car was indeed available (""inventory error,"") ... he even sent photos to verify it. Another hour on the road, and we were back where we started. During the test drive, I inquired whether the vehicle runs on regular gas, and was advised that the 2.0 engine requires premium ... that's a deal-breaker for us, so we returned to the dealership. I was curious about this new revelation, and checked the inside of the fuel tank lid, only to discover that premium is ""recommended,"" not required ... there's a huge difference. I pulled up some information to show the salesman (don't want to mention his name ... he was really a low-key guy, pleasant to speak with) that only the statement, ""Premium Unleaded Fuel Only"" requires that you spend the extra $.60/gal. He responded, ""I just learned something I didn't know."" That kind of piqued my suspicion as to how this dealership is run, but we proceeded with the negotiation song-and-dance. It was downhill from there. The price of the vehicle was, as promised, about $10k off sticker, which was certainly doable. Of course, management low-balled my trade, but that's to be expected ... easy to overcome, since I had several documents showing about a $5k difference. To their credit, they didn't try to pull that ""sales tax savings"" gimmick, apparently figuring (correctly) that we wouldn't fall for it. With each exchange of numbers, my faith in the dealership waned, primarily due to the slew of add-on charges. $350 for ""Consumer Services,"" which translates to ""Dealer Prep,"" something I hadn't seen in years. So they want me to pay for them to clean their car ... huh? $502 for ""Taxes and Fees,"" which the salesman said was an error ... should be $52. For the record ""corrected"" amount shown was $205. Then there's this $75 ""Dealer Inventory Tax,"" added if their sales target is not reached ... so we should pay because they didn't do enough business. Yeah, right. DeMontrond doesn't pay my taxes; I'm certainly not paying theirs. Add a $500 discrepancy for my trade, and we're all-of-a-sudden about $1600 apart ... and not because of the vehicles' prices, but simply an effort by the dealer to squeeze as much from the consumer as possible via hidden costs. Needless to say, I still have my car and they have theirs.   ",2.0
12,"July 26, 2019",I walked in after going from dealership to dealership trying to find a good deal and truck. When I stepped into Demontrond GMC I met Raul Garcia and I told him what I wanted. He didn't waste any of my time and didn't try selling me something I didn't ask for. I got the truck I wanted and he gave me a great deal. He was very respectful towards my family and I. I will be returning to speak to Raul Garcia again for another vehicle.  ,5.0

14,"June 03, 2019",When in to get a key programmed. Key was covered under my warranty. Technician was not fully aware of what he was doing and as a result of that he caused my suv to be totally disabled. Instead of them taking ownership of what they did and take care of it. I had to pay 300 bucks for another key because the technician didn't know what he was doing. Me personally I'd never come here again. I've never felt so cheated as a customer in my life,1.0

Bait and Switch. Purchased a 2014 Buick Enclave on July 28, with leather seats. When I came on August 1 to pick it up, the so called leather seats I had ordered were after market seats (which was never told to me) and completely covered front and back with puckered, and rippled leather everywhere. The leather was cut to short and was marked leather but had a foam like backing on it like vinyl. They had the car in the dealership ""cooling off"" . They told us to make it nice for when we got in it...it was really to cool off the leather in hopes that is would shrink. They did refund my money after I told them that if they were not willing to give me factory seats like I thought I was getting, then we were not taking possession of the car. We now were without a car, since they took back the lease on Monday, we had to literally walk down the street to rent a car for a week or so , so we can go look for another car AND worst of all my credit now shows a car on it that I dont own, at least until they can correct the paper work. AND I am very sure my credit score will go down because of all this. ...They tried very hard to pull a fast one on us, but we thankfully caught them. I only wonder how many others they have pulled this on...and how many more they intend to pull it on. Thank you for your time. I have submitted to BBB, FTC, and numerous consumer blogs. I have also submitted complaint directly to GMC. Not only am I going to go the extra mile to do all this...I have already STOPPED 2 sales by friends, since Friday...I'm on a role! The sad thing is, I have purchased 3 cars from them in 3 years, and referred 2 other people to them too...you would think they would have tried to make me happy. Can't fix Dumb and can't keep consumers quiet like the old days!!!",1.4
69,"August 04, 2014","So, I bought my used Cadillac based on the Warranty Forever thing they have going and brought it in for servicing twice.  The first time was for a 75k maintenance check up.  The Service Tech didn't know what that entailed.  I guess he eventually figured it out.  When it came time to pay, I was using a coupon from a coupon book I was mailed from the dealership.  Apparently I'm the best customer they ever had and the only one who ever received a coupon book because he didn't know what to do with my coupon!

Second visit I just wanted an oil change and tire rotation.  I asked though if I need the Maintenance 1 service performed, if it was more than just the oil change.  The Service Tech did not know what the Maintenance 1 service was.  I had to show him a postcard I received from the dealership stating ""You might need to have your car serviced with the Maintenance 1 service""!  

There were more issues but I'm not going to bore  you with the details, all of which made the Service Tech look highly incompetent!  At time of payment, the bill for just an oil change and tire rotation was $115.00!!!!  I know it's a Cadillac but geesh!  He said he didn't think that was correct and went out and spoke to someone.  He came back and said, no, that's right because my car needed synthetic oil.  They charged me over $12.00 for a quart of oil!  

Forever Warranty or not, I'm not going back to them!!!  What ripoff artists!  Oh, and I was the first customer in that morning and it took them 1 hour and 45 minutes!",2.4
70,"July 24, 2014","Never believe anything they said. 

They want to sell you their 100,000 miles 10 years warranty. After my poor experiences and harassed personally by this dealership's manager , I immediately told all my co-workers what I suffered and humiliated.

Here is some clues, 
#1> their 100k 10 year warranty isn't a lie, but from what I found from BBB Complaints, They refused to repair cars that under warranty at 2013/12/23.

#2> they are dishonored by charging extra state inspection, and  charged the state inspection again.

#3>One client waited for 12 weeks for the repair and warranty work.

72,"March 18, 2013",Went to go get my car service after reading the technical service bullitin. The service manager told me straight up that it was not covered under the bumper the bumper warranty. She did not even bother to look it up on the computer. I educated her on the document number and TSB issued by General Motors. They should train there staff to check on the issue before telling customers one thing. When i asked them to look it up on the computer they acted like it was such a hassle. They offer fovever warranty! Thats a joke! Dont wait your time ! ,2.0
73,"March 11, 2013","Worst service experience of my life (I am 49).  First of all, the Advisors don't return calls. I had a lot of work done on my Grand Prix. I had a new supercharger installed (the belt was not installed properly, causing wobble & squealing). Additionally, the technician left my radiator overflow hose loose & laying on the belt, causing it to be shredded.  I left multiple messages with my Advisor, no return calls.  Eventually, I took the vehicle back in & my original Advisor was out, so a different Advisor helped me.  He had the technician fix the belt & said he would order a new hose & call me back to schedule an appointment.  He even filled out paperwork, but.......you guessed it, no return call.  I also had new speakers installed due to electrical short (I was told that the technician ran new wiring all the way back to the stereo.  When the shorting persisted, I pulled one of the speakers to find that no new wiring had been done). The poor service is one thing, but being out-and-out lied to is another.  Do not take your vehicle to this dealer!!!! ",2.0

Hi, George - Thanks to you and 'Big John' for our Demontrond experience on New Year's Day.  We feel that we were treated fairly--from prices to ease of transaction (including the nice F&I guy, whose name escapes me right now).  As car-buying experiences go, this was one of our most painless.  Kudos to all involved!
 
Hank is completely enamored with his 2005 4Runner and has already taken a working 'road trip' to Dallas in it--he cannot contain his enthusiasm for this truck with its comfort, performance, gas mileage, and good looks!
 
My new 2010 Kia Forte Koup SX is wonderful to drive and the sound system is fantastic!  It's such a pleasure to have a fun, stylish, yet practical car.  It's everything I wanted in a new car, and I'm so glad Hank discovered it on the lot--I hadn't ever seen one before.
 
Hank and I are happy to be driving automatic transmission vehicles after all the years; our kids ended up with our old vehicles and both are very pleased, as well.  I guess the timing was just perfect for us to enter all these transactions.
 
Please forward this message to Big John, the F&I guy, your Sales Manger, General Manager, and Mr. Demontrond.  Best wishes for your successful 2011!
 
Sue & Hank H
