0,"June 02, 2020","When we need a car, we truly feel like we have a friend in the business. Frank is a stand up family man who truly values your business, doesn't play games, and works hard to get you a fair deal. I would drive to another State to buy a vehicle from him. We have bought 2 vehicles from Holiday Ford and will continue to be loyal customers for many years to come. Honesty & Integrity in the car business is located a short drive North to Whitesboro.

1,"April 17, 2020",We had a great experience buying my daughters car. Our salesman Frank was on top of everything and considering I was buying sight unseen he FaceTimed me every detail of the car while it was sprinkling lol just to give me peace of mind. Upon arriving I was literally in and out in 10 min. He had the car spotless when we arrived and I had one happy daughter. The price was unmatchable as I had been looking for months to find the perfect deal. Can’t remember the finance guys name but he was super awesome too! So thank y’all and especially Frank for a great deal and such an easy purchase!! ,5.0
2,"March 04, 2020","From the first contact to the last every person was phenomenal!! Jeramy Hansley and Justin McFadden could not have made this experience any better or easier!! They went above and beyond for us!! Thank you, and keep up the amazing work!!! I couldn't be any happier with my experience here and even though I live 3+ hours away, I will return again the next time I have a vehicle purchase need!!",5.0
3,"September 18, 2019","We worked with Frank who was very friendly, up-front and easy to work with. Same with Justin in Finance. The company chooses good people to employ who know their business and relate well to their customers without pressure or the typical non-sense that could be experienced in buying a vehicle. From my research they seemed to give the most competitive prices of all the regional dealers in North Texas. I was very pleasantly surprised.",5.0
4,"July 20, 2019",Frank is super fun to work with!  So easy to complete the deal. Bought a used truck. We have bought three cars from Frank at this dealership.  Definitely a lifetime client.,5.0
5,"July 19, 2019","I'll just preface this review with the fact that before I started car shopping, I had a dealer friend of mine give me an honest trade-in value. I would have bought from him, but unfortunately his dealership didn't have the car I was looking for.

After shopping around a half-dozen other used car dealerships, all other salesmen were devaluing my vehicle an extra $1.5k-5k. When I came to Holiday Ford, I expected the same, but I was pleasantly surprised when Frank gave me a fair trade-in value. Couldn't be happier with the prices, service, and my new (used) vehicle.

I drove from North Austin to make this deal, and will be recommending this dealership to friends. For anyone in the DFW area, the competitive pricing and honest sales reps make this dealership a no-brainer.",5.0
6,"July 05, 2019","I called Holiday Ford about a vehicle I saw on CarGurus. Frank was outstanding!  I was not able to drive out to Holiday Ford due to work schedule and family scheduled to go out of town. Frank did a FaceTime with me and the vehicle I was interested in. He answered all my questions. I have never purchased a vehicle over the phone without driving it or seeing it in person. I liked what I saw over the phone, but a little uneasy about pulling the trigger. He gave me confidence and helped  me realize it was something I could do without any worry. Beyond the great customer service, they delivered the vehicle to me. It was even more beautiful in person when they drove up to my driveway. I love my purchase!  Best car buying experience ever!

7,"July 04, 2019","Jeramy Hensley made my first time buying a new vehicle an amazing and comfortable experience. I had a lot of anxiety going in and I wasn't sure I was going to buy anything. I really wanted a new truck and I had my eyes on one in particular. Long story short, Jeramy made it fun and helped me understand every in and out of the process. I'll never go anywhere else. Holiday in Whitesboro and Jeramy Hensley have my business for life!",5.0
8,"June 22, 2019","Frank with Holiday was great response and answer thru text, not pushy let me be me and not follow me me around or call to pressure me to buy, a place that seams to sell good vehicles! Enjoyed it and would recommend to everyone. Oh and NO 30.06 signs",5.0
9,"June 05, 2019","Jeramy Hansley called me about the car I was interested in purchasing. I live a good distance from dealership. He had everything set up and ready to make the purchase process smooth and easy! Great sales guy! He also got my windows tinted quickly and offered delivery,  since I do not live close. ",5.0
10,"May 14, 2019","We've purchased several vehicles and this was BY FAR the best experience.  Jeramy and I had several text conversations and by the time we got there it was about half hour after closing.  He did not rush us, let us check out the 2 we were interested in and once we decided, we were on our way home in 
the 'new vehicle' within 45 minutes from our arrival.  Only walked inside the building long enough to take grandkids to restroom.  Jeramy reassured us that he would take care of everything and he delivered.  We did all the finance work over the phone with Justin McFadden and there was no high pressure.  They sent a driver to us (1 1/2 hrs away) with the papers to sign.  We are truly blown away and will most definitely be back.  Thanks Guys!!",5.0
11,"May 09, 2019","I was literally speechless!! I have never had such an AMAZING experience purchasing a vehicle! Jeramy said he would make it as easy as possible for me and he delivered...no, seriously he delivered my new Jeep right to my front door!  Well, Lee and John brought it - they were so sweet and friendly, I tried to feed them dinner, but they had to get back. Jeramy has no idea just how much it meant to me and my husband for this process to go so quick and easy for us.  I actually was interested in another vehicle, but he told me it was being sold as we first spoke, but he had a ""really cool"" Jeep.  I fell in love with it right off!  My husband will need a new truck soon, so we will return to this dealership (I actually never even had to go there! It was all done over the phone) We will purchase from them again and I will tell everyone I know what a great experience we had.  Jeramy always called or text me back quickly and even called after hours on his way to his kiddos ball games.  
Thank you so much for everything you did to make this as easy as possible.",5.0
12,"April 17, 2019",Just a number at this place. While looking at trucks and trying to decide on a color the sales manager takes the keys and puts the truck back on the line. Guess he didn't like where I parked it. Had to take salesman to shop so he could get jumper because truck wouldn't start. Price was not as described online. I had to ask about available rebates as they were not supportive in helping find all available rebates. Didn't get all incentives as described on Ford advertising. Can not get calls return after sale. Never met service department. No communication after sale from this place. I am only a number with them. Will not be back.,1.0
13,"March 01, 2019","Have bought multiple vehicles from Holiday, amazing experience and go well out of their way to take care of you before during and after the purchase.  Take the time to find you exactly what you need and then continue to provide the best service as long as you are a customer.  Excellent leadership and that resonates to all parts of the family of dealerships.  They represent Ford, Chevy, GMC, Buick and Cadillac so you have the pick of the litter to choose from.  Will never buy a car anywhere else!!",5.0
14,"January 26, 2019","I was looking for the perfect used truck, found one on line at Holiday. Called and was given Jeramy who went out in the rain to check out the questions I had about the truck.  We talked about the options and price and came to a fair deal I flew down to Dallas and they picked me up and took me to Whitesboro to get the truck. After I got home I noticed a problem with my truck, called Jeramy and talked it over with him. He arranged for a driver to pick up the truck in Kansas City and drive it back to Holiday to fix the problem then bring it back to me at no additional cost. The truck looks great and I am very happy with the truck. He didn’t have to do that I signed an AS IS statement at the time of sale and could have been out the money for the repairs. Jeramy is very knowledgeable and a standup guy if you want a fair deal on a car or truck I would recommend Jeramy.",5.0
15,"March 26, 2018","We have been buying Autos for over 30 years, this was the best dealership we have gone too.
Told them exactly what we wanted they looked and found the truck as we wanted.  Very friendly, and knowledgeable.
We are so pleased we are going to buy again from them.",5.0
16,"January 19, 2018","This was the BEST buying experience I've ever had...and it was online from 350 miles away! I felt like I was treated like a local resident! I will go back!  My sales rep, Frank Weneiger, knew what used truck I was looking for.  I could not believe the deal he made me so I could stay within my finances.....and he made it look easy!  Friendly, Fast, and Professional!  I would encourage anybody to shop at Holiday Ford in Whitesboro Tx.!  Frank Weniegar and his team will take care of you!  Truly Outstanding Service!

17,"December 25, 2017",I shopped online for a vehicle and located Holiday Ford.  I completed a brief request form and got a response in a timely manner. The internet sales department was very responsive to my questions and concerns. They made my first time buying experience outside of my home state smooth. Frank was very upfront and helpful. They did not bother me and respected my work hours. The purchase was transparent and I highly recommend their online sales team. ,5.0
18,"September 05, 2017",My overall experience with Holiday Ford was incredible. Frank was more than willing to assist with me in any way possible to get the deal done! He was friendly and made the process so smooth. They had everything set up for me and I was in and out of the dealership with my new truck within an hour!,5.0
19,"April 11, 2017","Salesman Frank Wineinger exceeded my expectations recently helping me with my truck purchase from Holiday Ford.  He was personable/professional, took the time to discuss all of my options and answered my questions thoroughly.  I will be recommended future business to Holiday Ford because of the outstanding service I received from Frank.   ",5.0
20,"March 12, 2017","Oscar was an extremely integral part of this new purchase transaction. I had been searching for an F150 for a number of months before speaking with him via internet sales. He was very knowledgeable of the unit I had been looking at and bent over backwards to ensure it was on the lot and ready for inspection and a possible test drive. He was instrumental in making sure the deal was completed although it would have been more satisfactory to me, the consumer, had he just been given the authority to negotiate the sales price instead of going back and forth, back and forth, between me and the finance department. Also he was extremely helpful in educating me on the ""workings"" of this vehicle. I don't know if this transaction would have ever been completed had it not been for Oscar. Thanks for your help Oscar !

21,"March 12, 2017",I had been looking at buying a new car for a couple of months.  I had talked to a couple of salesmen at a couple of different dealerships.  These were not great experiences.  Then I saw the car I wanted at Holiday Ford.  I called and talked to Oscar Colorado.  He was very friendly and agreed to be there early the next morning to show us the car we were interested in.  We drove the car and then it came time to deal.  I told them the price I wanted to pay and they beat my price !!!! Wow. What car dealership does that ?!?!  Within a couple of hours we were driving our new Ford Edge home.  This dealership is different from the others.  They are friendly and very willing to work with you.  ,5.0

23,"February 26, 2017",Bought our first brand new truck and had a great buying experience. Treated with respect and didn't feel pressured to buy. Nathan was a great salesman with lots of patience. Also financing was made quick and easy. ,5.0
24,"February 23, 2017",Dealership was very friendly and workable.  I came in with a list of things that were important to me and Nathan took great effort in finding a truck that had those items. Their pricing was the best and I checked several other Ford dealerships and none of them could come close to the pricing that Holiday Ford offered me.   The closing process was easy and quick and they did not try to push other services and programs on me.  Everyone there was polite and helpful and it couldn't have been an easier experience.,5.0
25,"February 08, 2017","I went to the dealership with the intention of just looking at a car. Oscar was very friendly. He told me about incentives with the car I was interested in. During the test drive he told me about the features the car had. I ended the test drive ready to buy the car. He was quick and efficient getting paperwork ready, and getting the car ready to leave with me the same day. I took it home and noticed a few flaws. I called Monday and told them the issues and had me bring it back in. They gave me a rental car and said my car would be back to me the next morning. Oscar delivered my car to me at work. They go above and beyond with customer service. I highly recommend using this dealership and Oscar! ",5.0
26,"February 06, 2017","If I could purchase all my vehicles from Holiday, I would!  They make things simple, have aggressive pricing and do not waste your time.  They are a breath of fresh air.  

I drive 45 miles to this dealership even though another dealer is 8 miles away.

Amanda was wonderful to work with.  She is very quick to respond and thorough with the entire process.

Love my new car!

27,"February 06, 2017","Bought a new F 250 Super Duty. Had to send it back twice to get the inside cleaned and still not done well. Came back for spray in liner and was told I'd have a truck to drive while that was being done. Instead, they gave me one of the smallest cars I've ever seen and it was filthy and on empty. Nice sales price on the new truck, but they made up for it on my trade. One way or another, they'll get their price! Definitely not worth the drive.",3.0

31,"January 13, 2017","My husband and I recently purchased a new truck from Holiday Ford. We were greeted by Nathan Penalver who showed us several options of the truck we were looking for. He was very knowledgeable of the features on today's new Fords. He was very giving of his time in explaining and answering all of our questions. No high pressure sales tactics involved...very impressive. Stewart Lawson was efficient and helpful in securing our loan. Nathan made sure we were introduced to the folks in the parts and service department before we left..again, very impressive! We were more than satisfied by our purchasing experience and would highly recommend this dealership.",5.0
32,"December 29, 2016","I'm not going to go into a lengthy description of what happened. But after several heated discussions. Steven, the manager saved the day. They did me right and solved all my problems. If you go here, I would deal with Steven as much as possible. His work m word is good",3.8
33,"October 01, 2016","I came to holiday ford to purchase my 1st truck, negotiated everything online, came to the dealership and changed my mind and was accommodated to get the Venice I like. They also waited and kept the vehicle for me since I drove a long way. They  had the best price around. All the employees I worked with were great.",5.0

35,"June 22, 2016","My 19 year old daughter was having a terrible time finding a car, mainly due to the typical nightmare of dishonest car dealers.  We pulled into Holiday Ford, and we prayed for an honest person.  Frank came out and met us, and the result was absolutely the most pleasant experience I've had buying a car.  My daughter found a car she wanted for the price she wanted.  The financing process was incredibly smooth.  I highly recommend Holiday Ford.",4.8
36,"May 02, 2016","After googling ""2012 Honda Fit for sale"", a 2013 Honda Fit Sport popped up for the Holiday Ford dealership. And get this... The price was amazing and even topped the price of the 2012 with about 3000 more miles on it. Still I was around 6000+ below asking price!!! So I inquired about it and within a few hours I got a call and an email from Kim, an internet concierge, and then Frank, my actual car salesman. Both of them were really awesome, not pushy like most car salesmen. Because this was my first time buying a car, it took me some time to think about it and I had a ton of questions which Frank didn't hesitate to answer! And on top of all of that, I work quite often, so Frank was able to respond via phone, call, text, email, or which ever was convenient for me. This made the process so much easier for me! After all my questions were answered, whether about the car itself or the financing, I purchased the car. Justin, the financing agent, was awesome as well, sharing options for payment, with detailed information on the outcome of each option. I'm not that good at math and this was my first time going through this process, but Justin brought it down to simple terms for me, making it even easier for me to come to a decision! Lastly, because I live an hour and a half away, Holiday Ford delievered the car to my door step! The two gentlemen delivering the car shared some driving tips and pointers on maximizing the value of my purchase when considering a later purchase of a new car (thanks guys)! After a brief conversation on the beauties of small towns and the easy business is done within them, I signed my paper work while sitting in my dream car... Flawless experience. Later that day Don, the sales manager, emailed me thanking me for my business with extended hands of service as well, followed by an email and text from Frank echoing the same sentiment!!! Even after a few days, Frank has still answered my inquiries! This is an amazing place to purchase from. Everyone here is super friendly and we'll knowledged on their product and craft. Highly professional team with the ""small town"" feel of hospitality, patience, and understanding. Love my car, love the experience, and love the fact that Holiday Ford was where I purchased my first car from! Thanks guys, May God bless you to continue to do good work, selling good product, to good people! -Ken ",5.0
37,"March 06, 2016","This is the third car I've bought from Holiday, the second I've bought from Vicki Timpson, and I would highly recommend both Vicki and the Holiday dealership. Vicki and the entire dealership staff made the buying experience easy and straightforward. It was actually fun buying a new car! They were honest and straightforward, and sell at an Excellent price. I have found it hard to find a dealer that sells for a price as good as Holiday.",5.0
38,"February 06, 2016","After searching locally, I opened my search radius nationally for price comparison. I had my doubts of bait/switch with advertised online pricing as it was substantially below my best local dealers. I contact them and had the privilege working with Adam Hulsey. There was no haggling and he maximized my manufacturers rebate for my zip code to capture additional available savings. From a phone conversation early in the week the process began. He was transparent of what would happen, what I needed to provide and bring with me day of purchase. Simple, streamlined. I flew to Texas for my purchase. We had a driver there waiting at the airport to bring us back to the dealership. Once we arrived Adam efficiently began the paperwork process. We were introduced to Sales and General Managers. Also very personable. We did a walk around on the truck and found that there was a dent and chip in the paint from factory transport as the truck was just delivered the week prior. They offered to pull the bumper and switch with another truck on the lot. Wasn't necessary as they had another vehicle on the lot and they provided an additional discount off the purchase price for the hassle. I was very happy getting the same truck, but different VIN, perfect condition, and additional $$ off! Financing with Stuart was also no pressure. We were on the road for our 1,600mile trek home shortly there after. Even after all expenses from the trip I was still able to save thousands from my best local deal. After being initially skeptical, I wouldn't hesitate to buy from them again and will certainly refer family/friends that are in the market for a new vehicle to Holiday Auto Group.   ",5.0

After evaluating my trade in, they provided an exceptional buying experience that was quick, precise and made the overall experience of buying a vehicle a pleasure.

52,"November 11, 2015",I can't say enough positive things about this dealership. I'll start with a bit of a background. I've been looking for a 3-5 year old Ford Mustang with reasonable miles and in good condition and was almost ready to throw in the towel. I'd found 3 units that fit my needs at other dealerships but couldn't close the deal because the other dealers were always dishonest about price or vehicle history. I finally found a great deal at Holiday on a 1 owner local trade in. My salesmen Frank and Mason worked with me on price and got the financing in place before my 90 minute trek to the dealership. When I arrived everything was exactly as discussed and I found no problems with the car. In the end patience pays off as long as you trust that God knows what He is doing. ,5.0
53,"November 11, 2015",Vehicle we wanted was dealer traded a few hours before we got there.  Nothing comparable so ended up being upscaled to a higher priced vehicle.  Process took around 5 hours.  Someone transposed our zip code so the paper work ended up with the wrong city.  Registration sticker was returned to the dealer and they were able to forward it to us.  No title yet.  Called dealer almost three months after the sale and left voicemail.  No return call.  I finally called the transportation department and found out I have to go to the regional transportation office to get a title.  Great price if you are willing to put up with the hassle. ,4.0

There is absolutely no pressure, no staged conferences with managers...they are straight shooters that know what they are doing.  They will give you the best price you will find ANYWHERE the first time you ask so it eliminates the need to haggle and play the typical back and forth game that has always been so annoying to me elsewhere.  If they don't have what you want, they will help you find it. Not only that, they are just good folks.",5.0
56,"November 02, 2015","This was the 8th dealer vehicle purchase I have made in my life. It was by far the easiest. We agreed on a price on the phone after seeing the truck I wanted online. I drove up and met with Vicki and Michael Timpson. They started getting everything together while Tom was bringing the truck up to the building. While I was test driving the truck with Tom, Michael worked on getting me a better interest rate than my credit union was offering. When I got back from the test drive the paper work was done. We waited a short while for Stewart in finance while Tom was getting the truck filled up and cleaned. Sitting in the finance office was a breeze. NOTHING was added to the truck. The numbers didn't change. Everything we agreed upon was EXACTLY how it was stated over the phone. Stewart made everything easy with absolutely no stress. Walked out of finance and Tom walked us through every feature on the truck including setting up my phone on the Sync system. 

I was back on the road an hour after arriving at the dealer! I walked out feeling happy not beat down like most other vehicle purchases. It was easier than going out to dinner!",5.0
57,"November 01, 2015","I highly recommend this dealership, especially my salesman Johnny Lee Godsey.  He was very knowledgeable and helpful about the Ford pickups.  I wanted a truck with a specific hard-to-find equipment combination and he spent several months locating it for me.  I really appreciated Johnny for his determination to keep searching until he found exactly what I wanted.  His courteous service and great personality made for a wonderful vehicle buying experience!  I am very happy with my new truck!

Justin McFadden made the finance/paperwork experience very easy to understand.  He explained everything clearly and answered all of my questions.  He spent a lot of time discussing all the options and took all the stress out of the process.  Justin was very professional with a great personality!

58,"October 29, 2015","Vicki & Michael Timpson were awesome!   Due to traffic I was running late and Vicki had the car I was interested in seeing ready for the test drive when I got there.   She got my paperwork filled out quickly and utilized the team around her to multitask so we could get it done quickly.  I'm sorry I kept them after closing, but they were kind  and patient throughout the whole thing.    Michael made sure that all of my personal items got moved to my new car - he even moved my license plate bracket - and ran me through the features of the vehicle; answered all of my questions and made sure I understood everything before sending me off.

On the drive home, I was thinking I'd left my sunglasses in the roof pocket of my old car - nope, Michael moved those over as well.   Great job y'all.  Thank you for making the car buying process easy and making me feel like I was your top priority.

Everyone I spoke to at the dealership was friendly and ready to help.   A shout out to the finance team for sticking with us after close.",5.0

It's elevated my respect for sales in the car feel and straightforward approach left me feeling highly respected of him.  I highly suggest reaching out to Michael and Vicky Timpson at holiday ford in Whitesboro Texas. They will save you time and mostly save you money.

61,"October 27, 2015","My wife decided she wanted to get buy her first new car, so we started the search. We went around to a few dealership close to Mckinney and never had a good experience. Most of the salesman were super pushy and their pricing was never good. We looked at 4runners, tahoes, and explorers. We decided on the 2016 Explorer limited based on the price, features, and looks.
 We looked around and could not find the exact thing she wanted so we decided we had to order one. I went in to two ford dealers and called a few more here in the metroplex. I got quotes anywhere from sticker price to a couple thousand off. I decided to call up to Holiday and talk with them. Michael gave me a quote that beat all the other ones by $2k. I asked Michael what he needed from me and he said ""just come to the dealership and shake my hand"". I drove up there as soon as I could and placed the order. I was warned from another ford dealer that ""Holiday ford will play tricks on you, they will promise one price but when your car comes in the price will be higher"". This was not the case. We got a call yesterday and Michael informed me that my wifes new explorer just came off the truck. He told me that we would be able to pick it up today. My wife so extremely excited. I let him know that I had locked in a super low rate on my own. He offered to see what Justin and Stewart could do in financing. They came back with an even lower rate than I have seen from any bank or credit union. Which made the whole process so simple. We showed up today at 4pm to pick up my wife's new car. He met us and got us on a test drive. The car was perfect and everything we wanted. We ran inside to the financing office and signed all the paper work and were out in 5 mins. They never tried to upsell me things we didn't want or need. Michael then set us up with a gentleman (sorry I forgot his name) that spent all the time we wanted showing us the features and how to use the Sync system. We were in and out without any hassle and the price ended up being less due to another rebate. So Michael and Holiday saved us over $3k, didn't hassle us, were prompt, and great people. If I am looking for a Ford I am going to Holiday first. Thanks again to the fine people at Holiday!",5.0
62,"October 23, 2015","Recently I bought a pre own vehicle from Holiday Auto Group. The whole purchase went smooth, most of my communication was done through email. At first they are were very cordial letting me know information about the vehicle, they even went ahead and gave me discount on the purchase price of the vehicle. Getting to the dealership was a long way from where I live about two hours away. When I got there they had the vehicle ready, the salesman I was having communication with was not available. I tested out the vehicle everything was great, signed the paperwork and drove the vehicle off the lot. The staff mentioned I would be getting a survey emailed to me about my purchase. The following day after the purchase the vehicle began making screeching noises when I would brake. I waited a few days before I contacted the dealership (through the email I was provided). Well it has been over a week and I have not received a response from Holiday Auto Group, nor have I received the survey where I was supposed to rate them on the purchase I made, and I frankly correlate not receiving the survey due to the issue I have been having with the vehicle. The vehicle also came with another issue that was not mentioned in the details or by the sales person. The vehicle’s rear right seatbelt does not buckle (safety issue), also the front outlet does not work and like I mentioned the vehicle makes horrible sounds when you brake. I do accept fault for not doing a thorough investigation on the vehicle and dealership and for blindly trusting all the positive reviews on their webpage (I had not been in auto market for quite some time). So I am posting this not out of ill will but out of concern for future buyers that are looking to invest in a pre-own vehicle from Holiday Auto Group. I suggest you do your homework quite well do not get swayed by all the positive reviews you see on their webpage. Check other online sources, try staying within your area I think it serves you better as you can much more easily drive to that dealership if you do end up having concerns or issues. I would have wanted to be one of the many satisfied customers of Holiday Auto Group but that will not be the case. 

Please be careful with who you do business with and good luck on your future auto purchase!

68,"October 12, 2015","I've bought at least 3 dozen cars and trucks in my lifetime and never felt like a dealership truly stood out until now. I just purchased a Ford F-250 from Vicki and Michael Timpson at Holiday Ford in Whitesboro, TX and it was so unbelievably simple and fast. I shop for price and Holiday Ford simply had the best on-line prices out there as well as the best selection of F250s. I live in the DFW Metroplex and found exactly 1 vehicle that met my needs in my local area. I know the local dealers can locate any vehicle I need but I frankly don't have that much patience. Holiday Ford had 16 trucks that met my needs so I took the 90 minute drive to check them out. Five minutes on the lot and a test drive and I had the truck I wanted. Easiest and best deal of my life. Don't go up there though expecting them to negotiate. Their prices you see on line are set although they do a search for incentives and in my case I saved another $1250. They knocked over $13K off MSRP without me even asking. Vicki and Michael are a friendly no BS team that sell a lot of vehicles. They are busy so you might want to make an appointment with them before heading up. I didn't but they tossed Tom over to help me and he was great. Michael wrote me up and I was out of there in 2 hours.  All I can say is that if you live in the Metroplex, take a 90 minute drive to Whitesboro and buy from Holiday Ford. And by the way, thank you Ford for honoring active duty and retired military with a $500 rebate. Class act and truly appreciated. Trust me. This dealership is is a hidden treasure.

Stewart Lawson was a great help with the financial paper work.   And I meet Rob Marshall service department so I could put a face with someone when necessary to bring vehicle in for service.

While working different angles to maximize my rebates, bonuses, cash back, etc..., Vicki took the time to explain how she arrived at each total.  Her quick calculations were within a few pennies of what was officially financed!  Albeit a list of add-ons was presented to me, there was no pressure in attempting to up-sell me features that I could also get.

The amount of time Tom took to go over the new vehicle and all its features was well worth it!  Although I am technically inclined; new cars have an amazing amount of information that is best learned before starting to drive for the first time!  All my questions were answered, even one that had to be responded to after I left the dealership!  Now that is caring!

It has been a week now and I am overjoyed that I found my new vehicle and that Vicki helped make it happen!

Everything was transparent and the agreed on price never changed after the truck was built and delivered.  In fact, the factory rebates at the time of ordering were pulled at some point by Ford, but they still honored the price without any issues.  Just a day or two before I signed the papers a different rebate became available and I was able to claim it.

111,"June 15, 2015","I read many great reviews about Holiday Ford and even spoke to a few people who'd bought there and it was nothing but ""excellent service,"" ""going above and beyond to get you a deal,"" and many other great recommendations. So I found a car I wanted. I WANT TO BE AS TRANSPARENT AND FAIR AS POSSIBLE: this vehicle was at the top of my budget, the price was a pretty fair price; my credit history is good but young; I'm upside down on my current car; and I knew there was a real possibility that a deal couldn't be worked.  My review is not ""poor"" because I didn't get the car I wanted, it's ""poor"" because from the very beginning it felt as though the salesman couldn't care less whether or not I bought a car. At every turn there was some reason they ""can't"" do something.  The most frustrating one was when he said they ""can't"" give me what my trade is worth because ""all [they] base [their] offer on is what [they] can get at auction."" Today I got a letter from one of the banks that says I was approved for an amount about $1500 less than what was applied for. I thought, ""that's not much of a price difference; surely we can deal."" So I call up Frank about it and he says he'll look into it and call me back.  Five hours later, I haven't heard from him, so I call him again.  He says that the bank is going to charge them a fee so I'd have to come up with at least $3800 to put down, ""otherwise [they]'d be losing money.""  I want to reiterate: I'm not upset that I didn't get the car I wanted; I'm dissatisfied because the customer ""hospitality"" was horrid.  I'm not particularly interested in what kind of money the dealer would lose. If the deal can't be done, it can't be done.  Thank you.  To top all that off I've been getting these stupid fake automated emails from them.  One of them even asked how I was enjoying my new car....

They took the time to build the exact vehicle with me over the phone, they quoted me a price that was in my price range, ordered the vehicle and arrived early.  No haggling, no games, no upsells.  Awesome experience!  I had about an hour drive to pick up the vehicle, but it was worth it.  Thank you Holiday Ford!",5.0

I was given a chance to think about the deal. There was no need. I had not seen a better deal anywhere else. They have done several follow ups to check on my experience. I was completely pleased with everyone at the dealership.,5.0

122,"June 04, 2015",Best auto buying experience I have ever had.  The price was great and the service was excellent.  Michael was a no pressure kind of salesman and Stewart took us through the finance process without  pushing additional items.  This was a great team to do business with!,5.0
123,"June 03, 2015","I dealt with the internet sales department, which at Holiday Ford consisted of husband/wife team Michael and Vicki Timpson.  These two sales people were each excellent, and together made the entire purchasing experience quick, efficient and enjoyable.  This sales team was empowered to negotiate the entire deal without having to consult with a sales manager.  That made the process friendly, not adversarial.  And the price they quoted was far better than the prices offered by the 5 other dealerships (all in the DFW area) with whom I had made contact.  

Likewise, Holiday Ford's finance manager was very experienced, didn't pressure me to purchase any of the typical add-on products, and helped me run alternative finance scenarios on a real-time basis, again without having to run to any ""boss.""  Finally, Holiday Ford had local sources of auto finance that were lower cost than anything else out there, including USAA (of whom I am a member).  

Finally, the trade-in value offered to me for my vehicle was fair, and in fact better than (a) the CarMax offer I had obtained before going to the dealership, and (b) the trade-in values offered by the other dealerships I had shopped.

Bottom line, I was able to unbundle the transaction into its three components:(a) new car price, (b) trade-in value and (c) finance.  The sales and finance people actually assisted me in this process.  As a result I obtained, by far, the best ""deal"" that I could have found anywhere in the area.

The fact that the sales and finance people were low key, pleasant to deal with and very straightforward (i.e. honest, and not deceptive) made this purchase the best one I have ever experienced.  That says a lot, considering this is the 60th auto I have purchased for myself, my spouse and my three now-grown children.

I have already talked up this dealership to my family members and friends who are now, or may in the near future be, considering the purchase of a new Ford.  And I'll continue to do so.

Would I buy my next Ford from Holiday Ford?  Absolutely.  I would shop locally to learn what dealers nearer to my home have to offer, but I won't at all mind going out of my way to shop/purchase at Holiday Ford (Holiday Ford is almost 40 miles from my home, versus at least 3 Ford dealerships who are each within 15 miles from me).

The internet is a great equalizer in the hunt for a new car.  Knowing what inventory [which includes the correct color(s), all of (and only) the specific option packages and accessories I want] the local area dealers have on their lots, and what inventory those dealers' sister entities have on hand, allows me to find exactly the vehicle I want.  Likewise, estimating the trade-in value of a vehicle, and understanding interest rates on new/used car loans are each easy tasks to complete over the internet, in the cool of the evening and without pressure.  But if Holiday has on hand (or can get) the vehicle I want, I would trust Holiday to give me the best deal AND make that purchase experience simple, efficient and pleasant.  In any event, I would call Michael/Vicki and tell them what I want, and see if they could get it.

In the interest of full disclosure I would ordinarily comment of things that I think could have been improved.  But in this case, I have nothing to offer.  The experience was that good.",5.0

127,"May 26, 2015","Our experience with Holiday Ford was by far the BEST vehicle buying experience we have ever had from the lady at the front desk, to our salesman (Frank) to the finance guy.  We don't live in TX either.  Our plans for purchasing a vehicle happened to be later in the year, but we started our search locally just cruising the lots to get an idea what we might like.  After comparing prices and vehicles and what we were going to get locally, we expanded our search to the internet.  We quickly found what we wanted and all it took was a call to Holiday Ford - Frank.  The experience was pretty much smooth sailing after that.  There were no games or haggling.  The price and vehicle were already so much better than what we were finding locally we just couldn't pass up purchasing our vehicle now.  Frank had the vehicle ready and waiting for us by the next day.  It was exactly as he had described it to be and maybe even more.  Frank was great to work with.  The drive was easy to the dealership, and everyone at the dealership was really nice.  I will shop Holiday Ford again before I even check locally for another vehicle.  To clarify the earlier remark about pretty much smooth sailing (hence the 4/5 stars on customer service)...our title was mailed to the wrong tag agency.  It took a little bit to get it straitened out, but eventually our title did arrive at the correct tag agency.  This would not deter us from shopping here again.  I would still drive from out of state to this dealership when shopping for our next vehicle.  ",4.8

130,"May 14, 2015","I live in Flower Mound , TX, and I knew I wanted a 2015 F150 SuperCrew.  I first went the closest dealer and drove one, and loved it.  I then got that dealer to order me one I could spec out, I put down a deposit and felt like I was getting a decent deal.  Well about a week later I came across a thread on f150forum talking about the crazy deals some TX dealer was doing.  I checked out the thread and they were talking about Holiday Ford in Whitesboro.  Some of the posters were skeptical of the low prices and thought it was just bait to get someone to the lot.  I called them up and spoke with Michael, and explained what I wanted to order.  He said he would build it out and shoot me a price.  Later that evening I started thinking I could probably get more options for a competitive price for the mid-range truck I had already ordered.  Michael built both trucks out and priced them for me.  To my surprise, he was able to sell me a nicey equipped King Ranch F150 cheaper than the other lot's mid-range Lariat with less options.  So I ordered the truck through Michael and he guaranteed the price.  Approximately 6 weeks later when the truck came in I called ahead for financing, got a great deal and was in and out in less than an hour.  I've since shared my experience with several friends and when the time comes again, I'll be looking at Holiday Ford in Whitesboro.",5.0

135,"April 15, 2015","I found an unbeatable deal on the internet while sitting in the sales office of a different Ford dealership.  I called Vicki Timpson while playing the traditional haggling game with the other Ford dealership.  Vicki and I had an agreement on the phone before the other Ford dealership gave me thier initial offer.

The next morning, we met in person and I was driving off in my new Ford within two hours.

I am convinced the price I paid could not be beaten by any other Ford dealership.  Vicki Timpson, Michael Tmpson, and Julie Leeper made sure I was getting the advantage of every rebate and discount Ford had to offer.  They seemed to know all the tricks to help me get the best deal and financing possible.

I felt like Vicki, Michael and Julie were trying to squeeze every penny out of Ford for my benefit.  In past car buying experiences, I felt like the salesperson and finance department were trying to squeeze every penny out of me for the benefit of the dealership.

In short, I could not imagine a better car buying experience.  I saved thousands.  Defintely worth the drive.",5.0
136,"April 14, 2015","I shopped for several months for a vehicle and talked with Holiday Ford first. They pretty much told me they were not going to be beat, but I am highly skeptical of car dealers so I proceeded to shop around. I talked to about 14 dealerships in the surrounding 200 miles. Some didn’t even want to deal over the phone and none matched the price. As for my local dealer Paris Ford, they were $2000 above Holiday. So after about a month of dealing I finally went back to Holiday and ordered my truck. Mike Timpson quoted me a price and we ordered it. Six weeks went by and my truck comes in so I sit down at my computer and get the price he quoted me and drive to Holiday Ford. The whole time thinking I was going to get the typical dealership run around when it was time to actually buy the truck.  I was fully prepared for a higher price than what he originally quoted, but to my pleasant surprise it was exactly what he said. After the test drive and a little paperwork we went to the finance department. At this point I thought this is where the run around would start, but as before the finance guy was just as helpful and did not pressure me to buy any warranties that I did not want and made it very easy. The whole ordeal took less than an hour, and this dealership was busy as it was a Saturday. All in all I couldn’t have asked for a better new car experience. ",5.0

150,"March 04, 2015","Over the process of a few weeks, I have worked with a dealer in my home state to deliver a Mustang GT.    The dealer was unable to deliver the results, and actually criticized Holiday Ford.  The dealer went on to say Holiday Ford was using a bait and switch program, and the Mustang I wanted was unable to sold at the price Holiday had it listed.  Instead of taking no for an answer, I contact Holiday and spoke with Vicki.

Vicki assured me there were no gimmicks, the car was available, and available at the price indicated on the website.   After speaking with my bank, and the bank speaking with Vicki, my dream car was becoming a reality. Two slow hours passed, and I began my two and a half hour trip to Texas.   On the way, my bank called and said the paper work was done, and it was for real.

Upon arrival at Holiday, I was met with the most impressive staff.   After all, I was late.  These folks stayed after hours to make sure the car was delivered, and delivered properly.

Shortly after this, I began to receive a number of emails, including one from the Presidnt of Holiday Ford, promising a good experience.  They were not wrong.

Michael was as competitive on price as any other large dealer, but far easier to deal with.  In addition, they provided a good offer on my trade and made the process as pain free as possible.

on our drive up, Michael advised the truck would be ready a day early, so we hustled to make it before closing.  Michael assured me the vehicle would be ready.

Upon arrival, Tom (sorry I don't recall his last name) provided a personalized tour of my new truck and gave more detailed instruction than when we bought a much more expensive motorhome!

Justin in the F&I Dept., was a surprisingly fresh experience in this area.  Frankly, people like Justin can quickly transform the buying experience.  Fortunately, in Justin's case, the transformation is a positive one, and made for a very quick closing.

We had the entire delivery done in about an hour.

As far as Michael and Vicki Timpson, I can't say enough good things as they always answered my calls, and provided answers to each of my questions.  Michael and Vicki know what it takes to earn customer loyalty.

The day after arriving home, I receive a follow-up call from Holiday Ford asking if I had any questions or problems.

In summary, we drove over 300 miles to Holiday Ford, and simply will not buy from any other Ford dealer again.  Holiday Ford has earned our business.

They have a very low pressure approach and are very professional. I will recommend them to everyone that is in the market for a new car.,5.0

The internet sales team made it as easy as could be. When I arrived to the dealership basically all I had to do was sign a few documents. INCREDIBLE sale, that's all I can really say! First class all the way and the finance guy made it as easy as possible and actually went above and beyond to even improve my purchase with extended warranty and GAP insurance",5.0
175,"October 28, 2014","I was in the market for a 2014 Edge and happened across Holiday Ford via Edmonds.  Glad I did, I have bought numerous Ford's but I can honestly say that the experience I had buying a new vehicle from Vicki and Michael was the best I have ever had.  The pricing was right in front of me, easy to understand and no upsell when I went to finance.  Just straight talk from people that I would not only reccommend to friends but I will be using again for my next Ford purchase.  ",5.0
176,"October 12, 2014","I had been looking to purchase my first car and was looking for a 2014 Subaru WRX Hatchback which are now pretty rare cars to find and have such a high demand for. Holiday Auto Group had just got this car in and boy did they give me an amazing deal! Frank Wineinger was the car sales man that I dealt with and I was absolutely impressed with the amount of character and integrity he had for helping me get the car of my dreams. The car alone was the color I wanted, it came with all the accessories I wanted and it was for a price that I wanted it for. The financing process with Jeramy was fast and he also helped me get all the terms that I wanted to purchase the car. I truly felt like a client and not just a customer. They even had a mobile guy come out to my father's house (my co-signer) in Garland for him to sign his portion of the documents because he couldn't make it out to Whitesboro that day. I'm very satisfied and If I ever need a car...this is the dealership that I will go to first. I will and have already told my friends/family/connections about Frank and Jeramy. Great, funny, truthful guys work with if you need a vehicle/deal. 

Thanks Holiday Auto Group! ",5.0

Manuel was the first to approach me the day i was just looking and when i went back to hopefully purchase he was the one i specifically asked for and he saw me all the way through till the end. His friendliness and honesty were and are very appreciated. Everyone was friendly. I feel confident that i was well taken care of that day and will be as i continue with them in the future.

Vicki and Mike Timpson in the Internet Sales Office were so helpful from start to finish. Their attention to detail and fast response rate either by phone or email were best in class. I would recommend Holiday Ford to anyone looking to purchase a car. Purchasing a car in Texas while living in Florida was a bit stressful but that stress was removed once Vicki and Mike explained how they do this for families all around the country. A excellent transaction driven by wonderful people and the best customer service I have ever had when buying a car.

189,"April 29, 2014",We had seen a used 2011 Kia on Auto Trader and called Jeremy about it. He answered even though it was an hour after y'all's business hours. We were able to see the vehicle with Frank the very next day. It was priced already a little below KBB Fair Purchase Price. Your finance guy beat the rate we came in with. What is there to complain about with all of that? We're not really Ford people but when we need cars you will be our first stop and first recommendation!,5.0

Emilee McKay, the receptionist, went out of her way to secure my new license plates while I waited for the skid plate install.

I spoke with Jeramy Hansley about this vehicle and he explained that they had just received the truck as a trade-in over the weekend and were still inspecting it to ensure that it met the quality standards necessary for them to sell it on their lot. He called me later that evening explaining that the vehicle checked out well and that he would text me some pictures the next morning, which was suppose to be his day off. I got the pictures as he explained and he willingly answered questions I had.  After he understood what I was looking for and listened to my concerns, he assured me that I would not be disappointed in this vehicle.  I gave him a deposit to hold the vehicle until I was able to make the four hour drive the next morning.  He was right!  The vehicle met all my expectations and I was driving home with it that Wednesday afternoon.  Jeramy was a pleasure to work with and his efforts made the process smooth and easy.

We live about an hour from the dealership so Jeramy gave us a rough quote on our trade-ins before we even left the house to keep us from driving so far for no reason. We did not have to do any back-and-forth with the dealership because they gave us competitive prices up front and were very transparent with their reasons for the numbers (Jeramy even helped us see a few flaws in the paint of one of our vehicles that the previous dealership didn't bother to mention).

There was one gentlemen that helped us on our initial visit to Holiday but unfortunately I dont remember his name. He was extremely helpful and kind. If you are looking for an honest and professional dealership, look no further. We live in Fort Worth, TX and found the vehicle we wanted on Car Guru and it was at Holiday in Whitesboro, Texas. If you are from the Dallas/Fort Worth area you know there are dealerships off of every exit. I have purchased vehicles from a few of the dealerships in the metroplex and not a one compared to Holiday. Jeramy was so professional, honest, friendly, and overall just really made us feel very comfortable about our car purchase. We were in and out of there in record time and on our way home with our new car. I told my husband I couldn't believe how smooth they made the car buying process for us. I will refer all my friends/family to Holiday and when we are ready to purchase our next vehicle down the road, we will definitely drive back to Whitesboro, TX to see Jeramy and crew at Holiday.

For those of you looking for the best deal and the smoothest customer experience, we were above impressed with the staff and the competitive pricing.  Being from San Antonio, we weren't sure whether to make the drive, but the deals simply couldn't be beat locally.  I must say, IT WAS WORTH EVERY MILE of the drive to end up with the amazing deal and the impeccable service that we experienced.  If you are second guessing their advertised deals... don't!  There were no hassles, hidden fees, and the advertised price (which was significantly better than our local dealerships) was exactly what we got!  No tricks, no gimmicks. Just value, excellent service, and a wonderful, friendly staff that eased us through our next car purchase.

207,"January 01, 2014","My wife looked for a new truck for our son for two months in the Dallas area. She finally came across Holiday Ford (Whitesboro, TX - 40 miles north of where we live) via the Intranet. The pricing on their F150's were very competitive compared to what we had been seeing. She inquired through the company website and we received a call from Michael Timpson - he confirmed the pricing online was correct. They had a nice selection of trucks AND in the color we wanted (black). The first truck Mike showed us was the best truck for our money….he didn't try to oversell or up sell us- he treated us like we were one of his family members. We bought a 2013 Ford F150 that night - showed up around 4:30 and were out of there by 7:30. Everyone there was great to deal with and we could tell they truly appreciated our business.

Go see Michael Timpson OR even better go see Michael and his wife Vicki - They work in the same department! The 40 mile drive was well worth it!
