0,"March 26, 2020","From my initial call to Rebecca , the receptionist, to Ms. Melissa Blake, service advisor, to the greeting which I received upon pulling into the service bay, this was the BEST, most thorough and pleasant BMW experience which I have EVER had.  I have owned several specialty BMW's including an Alpina M3, M6 convertible and several sedans.  The attention to detail and customer service at this dealership is unparalleled.  I will drive the extra distance to service and likely purchase a BMW from BMW of Tyler.",5.0
1,"March 06, 2020","I bought my first BMW at the Tyler dealership 20 years ago. I currently own 4 BMWs and will
be a BMW fan forever. It is the Ultimate Driving Machine. This was also my dealership until this
past week and I had the unfortunate luck to be greeted by Melissa! Rude, unwelcoming, unprofessional and I could go on. She ruined the whole experience in such an otherwise nice place to be. Not a good fit for such a place. I won't be back until she is no longer an employee.",1.0
2,"November 30, 2019","I purchased a preowned Escalade from BMW of Tyler on Monday, November 25, 2019. I think it is exactly the vehicle I was looking for. My salesman, Jeff Davison did a thorough job explaining several options including another Escalade with more mileage. Everyone helped make the purchase easy. If you are looking for a preowned car or a new BMW, it’s definitely worth your time to check them out. The car had been properly serviced, CarFax in writing and was super detailed.",5.0
3,"November 07, 2019","Start by saying did not plan to buy until December.  Stopped by BMW Tyler to look at the new 2020 X3.

Jeff Davis met us promptly with a big smile. Jeff answered all our questions and let my wife drive our so

soon to be X3 .  After the drive we went into his office and very shortly we left with our new BMW X3

Also would like to thank Mr. Teeter for giving us a great deal on a new BMW.

I have worked with them twice in short period of time they made the process easy and with no pressure. The owner Jim Teeter took time to speak with me as well. The experience was truly great. Now let me also tell you about the service department. Wow! Brandon and Rick and everyone in the service department are fantastic. I want to thank everyone for making me feel like family through every encounter so far. I’m not one to write reviews but this dealership deserves this kind of recognition.

12,"December 30, 2017","I bought my first BMW years ago in the ""big city,"" and fell in love with the BMW product and brand.  But what has made me a loyal customer for life is my local dealer, BMW of Tyler.  It is unique to have a dealership where you feel totally comfortable with the people who work there.  John Richardson is outstanding in sales.  I have purchase several new and CPO cars from BMW of Tyler and I feel I have always received a great deal on my car purchases.  John is great about keeping me up to date on good deals and new cars, without being pushy.  Rhonda is fantastic in finance.  I also cannot say enough about the people in service, Jennifer, Michael, Cody, Henry, always seem to bend over backwards to accommodate me.  Thank you, guys, for making the total experience so wonderful!",5.0
13,"December 30, 2017","I purchased my first BMW in 2000.  In 2003 I was in a head on collision with an 18 wheeler going 55 MPH.  I survived with relatively minor injuries.  I have been loyal to the brand ever since.  My experience with the dealership in Tyler has improved to a perfect level since Bob Teter created the new entity, BMW of Tyler.  The sales staff (John) listen to what I want and are very fare and easy to deal with.  The service department has also become what one expects from BMW.  I never hesitate to recommend BMW of Tyler to my friends and acquaintances.

20,"December 19, 2017","This is the second car I have purchased from Tyler BMW and John Richardson.  I appreciate the fact that they did all they could to help me get out of my Infiniti....which did not hold its value AT ALL!  I doubt I will ever drive any other car. And my new x6 is AWESOME!  It is sporty, but a little understated, the electronics are fabulous and so easy to use. The interior is beautiful. I think this is the most favorite car I’ve ever owned!!  ",4.8

Mike Farmer was the salesman I had the pleasure to work with and the customer service he gave meant a lot. I had priced the vehicle in Dallas and he was able to do just as well, with a better warranty and being able to purchase local was the best thing. Mr. Farmer has called several times to make sure everything is going well with the vehicle and to see if I had any questions. That is what you call service after the sell! Thanks for making the purchase of my BMW so smooth. If you are in the market for new or used vehicle I definitely would recommend Mike Farmer at Mike Pile BMW!!!
