0,"June 24, 2020","I had started looking into getting a new car around the 4th of July. I had looked at a Honda Accord which I was quite fond of and a Nissan Altima hat I was also fond of. My mother wanted to look at a Kia Optima so we drove out to Westside Kia and met Jalen Hopkins he was the most polite young man I had met while looking at new cars, so basically he is  the reason Westside Kia received my business having him explain all 3 Optimas that I looked at with true knowledge, understanding, and overall great attitude made me decide to go ahead and get the Optima immediately instead of waiting until my birthday. The rest of your staff was as polite and understanding as he (Jalen) was. If you have manners and you are polite you will win my business every time, so I thank the entire crew that I delt with at Westside Kia and not only will I gladly recommend you to friends and family, I will be a repeat customer.",5.0

7,"May 04, 2020","The process of making an appointment could be better.  I've tried the online appointment before, but they told me to call in because it wasn't working.  When you call in, you have to get the maintenance guy himself on the phone to make the appointment.  It would be better if someone simply handled the appointments so you didn't have to keep calling back.  Chuck was my service guy, and he was very good.  It was getting to him that could use improvement.",4.8

The car I really wanted ended up being sold before I came back, but the car I ended up buying was nice.  Would have been nice to have a better selection of colors, however.

17,"February 22, 2020","Worst experience ever, be careful with all the hidden fees at the time you sign. They charge for a lot of things you don’t ask for and not event explain what is included in the payment, they just want to sell you up all the insurance with out asking. (They say change oil is include it, they make you pay for the oil change  coupons, and this is just an example),I can keep going, just don’t waste your time in this dealership please and money.... be careful with the people on finance, they just want to sale insurance of all type and don’t care about what you really need. Please ask all details of your payment Before signing..... I learned the hard way all this after I sign. ",1.0

20,"February 07, 2020","Great experience.  We dealt with the same salesman as before (Rick Hall), since it was a good experience in 2015.  We basically knew exactly which car we wanted and the color we wanted.  There were no exact matches at the dealership, but Rick was able to locate one and have it delivered within a couple of days.  I especially like the fact that under no time, either during the car search or the finance, did we feel under pressure to buy. Rick was able to give us an outstanding deal and get the exact car we wanted.  Even though Westside KIA is further away from where we live in the Heights, we would use this dealership again because of the great customer service we received.  ",5.0

I asked specifically at the end if that had been fixed was assured it was done. A couple of hours later it popped back on. By then I was miles away and had groceries in the car.

62,"September 05, 2019","My purchase from Westside Kia was great. I ran into the manager. He said , my dream truck is in the back. So as we walked to the back they were cooking beef fajitas. He introduced me to the owner Billy. Billy was doing all the cooking. This must be a joke what owner would be outside in the 104 degree heat cooking for his employees. Not sure about you but that made me really think highly of him and his staff. Billy offered me some tacos and man they were good tacos. So I saw that beautiful GMC truck and bought it. Mr. Zepeck in finance took care of the paper work. Real nice guy. I'm in love with my truck. I wish I could have drove off with 10 more tacos.  Thanks, Jon ",5.0
63,"September 05, 2019","I recently purchased my 2nd Vehicle from this dealership. Both vehicles were bought new and both times I went in with a no BS no haggle attitude. I know I don’t have the best credit but I bring what I can and they worked with me every time. The latest vehicle I did some more research and used their website to obtain information on the vehicle. Going off their website, I matched the stock numbers and accessories to what is supposed to be in the car. Unfortunately you don’t always notice whats missing until you drive off the lot and when I got home, I noticed there was no heated/cooled seats, an accessory that was mentioned on their website. I called and one of the managers told me ""don’t believe what you see on the internet..."" 

.....Well true to that statement, but it’s YOUR guy’s website and according to your advertisement, my vehicle should have come with heated/cooled seats. After further research, yes, it is an additional added on feature but still.... I thought I was getting a xxxx of a deal! I would have turned down that particular model in place of that accessory if I had known about it. 

Hopefully it’s just a typo on their website and they are not doing false advertising to get customers in the door.... I mean it’s not impossible that they would do that but.... you know what I mean? ",4.2

96,"March 09, 2019","Purchased a new 2019 Sorento on Feb 28. I had noted an amber warning light that I could not readily identify. It was the Directional Headlights which weren't working. I brought in the car at 5PM March 7 - close to quitting time and even though the car was brand new, there was some initial reluctance to take care of the problem unless I made an appointment for the following week (!).
Make a long story short, Rick Hall (Sales Mgr) saw me and as soon as he knew what the problem was made sure the directional headlight motor was replaced right then! 
I couldn't be happier with the quick repair service that was provided and Rick's help in resolving the problem.

97,"March 03, 2019","I've been looking at replacing a ten yr old Mazda CX7 and had pretty much zeroed in on a Sorento SXL. I test drove one in January but was checking other possible SUV's.
Finally decided to go to Westside based on their website inventory.
Unfortunately, three of them were demos and one was new, but wrong interior.
Then Rick said what about the showroom model? That worked and we very quickly came ot a price agreement. Got a fair trade in for the CX7.
The really nice thing is how quickly we finalized the deal, got an overview of all the features (and there are a LOT!) and drove home.
Came back the following morning to get tires inflated to proper pressure.
Everyone was friendly and accommodating. 
I hope this continues during ownership of the SUV.",4.8

104,"January 14, 2019","There have been three separate instances where they have not followed through with what they said. The my told me they would fix the cracks on the car that I was buying preowned, it took several weeks of me calling to ask them when can I come in for them to finally call me. I waited for an hour and a half and then the manager said the chips were too big to fix so they’d pay for the windshield. Now more than a month later, constantly trying to get in contact with the windshield company I find out that they told the company they are not paying for it. They are very sneaky. Even when I was buying the car I asked what the TTL was and if there was anymore fees and my salesman said “no that’s the final price, nothing more.” And then when I’m about to sign the paper and I see over $500 added of stuff they never told me about. There is a lady whose the owners daughter and she is very very VERY rude. 0/10 recommend. Please don’t go to this place. ",1.4

I loved my charger and at first I felt that nothing will ever make me part from it. My sister told me that I needed to go see David because he was simply amazing and will do everything to help you find what you were looking for. I met David and we talked cars. I’m the type of person that knows cats and I have a need for speed! However, in my mind I was thinking Kia, ugh I don’t know about that. David showed me their newest edition at their dealership, the Kia stinger. My first impression was, “wow! This was made by Kia”. It intrigued me to listen more. David was very knowledgeable about the features and the type of engine. I took the car for a test drive and I was immediately sold! David didn’t pressure me into making a purchase. I also test drive the premium stinger and David senses that I wasn’t happy with that car. He told me don’t worry I know the GT1 made you happy, let’s see what we can do for you. Long story short David, Rick and the owner made me feel as if I were family. They were attentive to my needs and I am ecstatic that I purchased my 2019 Kia Stinger GT1!

My service representative was Sebastian who did an OUTSTANDING job!
He is a great listener.  That day, the dealership had several cars ahead of me, but I had no choice but to wait on the vehicle.  Sebastian told me that it could be up to and hour and a half before he could get into diagnostics.  However, Sebastian noticed that I had my lap-top with me, and told me that while I waited, they had work areas at the dealership with wi-fi.  He also gave me the wi-fi password, and then pointed out that my car had a couple of recalls that he would have taken care of as well.
It was only about 35-40 min later (which was nice considering I thought it would be another hour before I would have any info on my car) and Sebastian informed me that the part needed for my car
would take take a couple of days to get to the dealership, but not to worry, the KIA dealership would be putting me in a rental car, that they would be paying for because my car was under warranty.
Sebastian then got me to the rental car service expediently, where I was taken care of promptly and on my way.
I then received a call from Sebastian the very next morning at 9:30 am that the dealership had the part for my car overnighted, it had been installed along with the two recall items fixed and I could come pick my car up!
I was elated to say the least!
My wife and I have purchased a couple cars from this KIA dealership and we have ALWAYS been treated like royalty, as well as any service item taken care of with the utmost respect for us, and fixed very expeditiously!

I must say I was VERY impressed with Sebastian... what a great young man, who knew what he was doing, and made me feel very much at ease.  He is a keeper guys!

Thanks again for all that you do for your customers.

Chuck was awesome.  The rest of your staff are gracious and helpful.

However, it was “pre-owned” which meant that I would lose 40,000 miles of power train coverage, and with a high interest rate of 7.99% int.  Heard their radio ad offering ZERO PERCENT FINANCING on NEW KIA’s.  Determined instead of paying the additional 2 grand and 4 thousand in interest charges, I could trade the 2017 Kia for a BRAND NEW KIA FORTE’.  After looking at the TRIM PACKAGES offered, I decided to UPGRADE to a 2018 Kia Forte S MODEL, with ALL THE BELLS & WHISTLES??  I could not have been happier?? They gave me an EXCELLENT TRADE IN VALUE, SAVED MONEY IN FINANCING, and DROVE off that very day in the EXACT COLOR & Trim package I REALLY WANTED.  Not only that I purchased the 120,000 BUMPER TO BUMPER WARRANTY w/out ANY deductible - if I bring it back to their dealership for service.

He told me that neither of the headlights were grounded properly so I told him to go ahead and fix that problem. Fast forward a month and I noticed that the driver's headlight was not working. I made another appointment. Again, my wife took the car in, and again they were rude. First they said there was no record of the appointment so she called me at work. I explained the problem and was told that previously they had only worked on the passenger headlight. I told him of my conversion with the gentleman previously and asked why both headlights were not repaired the last time. He said that according to the work order, only the passenger headlight was repaired and that we would have to pay $89.00 to have the driver's headlight repaired. I told him I had the extended warranty, He said he didn't have any information on that and asked ME for the phone number to check on the warranty. I gave him the number so he could do HIS job.

I have had my car only one year with 35K miles on it. After the service department looked over my car they stated that my ac repair was not covered under the warranty. Now for a reminder, Kia has a 60K bumper to bumper warranty!

I was told that a rock had put a hole in my ac condenser and that the part and labor would not be covered under my warranty. The part cost $575 and labor would run me over $500 +. I told them not to do the repairs, and I would pick my car up. I was then informed that I would have to pay $150 fee to the service department for looking over my car, which again is under warranty.

When I went back to pick up my car my son took me back to the dealership. I informed the service clerk I was not going to pay the $150 fee because my car is under warranty. We asked for the General Manager, and instead they called in the Service Director, Mark Alder. Mr. Alder informed us that the ac condenser would not be covered under the warranty, because I has a car owner had damaged my own car!! Imagine that, I damaged my own ac so that I could drive around Houston in this weather with no cold ac!!

The service department REFUSED to show me the hole and the damage that was made by the rock. Funny how you are blaming my repairs on a rock, but won't prove it to the customer!!

The service department is very unprofessional along with the management at Westside Kia. They will not honor their warranties has I found out today. Even the General Manager would not come out to what all the ruckus was about with his employees yelling at a customer. Very unprofessional dealership in all areas of management.

I called the corporate office for KIA after we left the dealership and got nothing but apologies from the corporate customer service department. I am still waiting on a phone call back from the corporate office.

Needless to say, I will be trading my car in for another car maker. Business's need to understand when they warranty their products, they need to stand up and do the correct thing! Take care of your customers, because we can make or break your business!

By the way, this was my second vehicle that was purchased through KIA, but you won't get another dime of mine! #westsidekia #kiaoptima #katy #kiakaty #kiawarrantiesnogood #kiafruad #kia #kiaconsumerreports #kiabbb #kiawarranty

The sale manager and I negotiated on the price for a 2017 Kia Sorento over the phone and came to an agreement that I would paid out the door for that vehicle for X dollars. When I came to the dealer to finish up the paperwork and found out that they tricked me. According to the paperwork, the price that we agreed before is not out door price, but it is a a selling price without tax fee, license fee, etc... The next afternoon, the sale manager (same one who I dealt with) texted me said because almost the end of the month, he is willing to bring the price down, he offered me another price X (this time is out the door price included my trade in vehicle), i rejected the offer and made my final offer price Y to him, then based on his text ""come get your sorento, you have a great deal"" after he received my text final offer. Next evening I came to sign paperwork, and again based on the paperwork, I need to pay the amount that he offered (not the amount that I offered and agreed by him and I even showed him my the text messages). Before I walked out of the dealer building, I shook his hand and told him that you have wasted my time, his replied was ""you are also wasted my time"". Over all, not to waste your time and money to do business with them (especially with the sale manager who I dealt with). They are dishonest, not a deal keeper, broken promises, not trust worthy.

281,"April 29, 2016","We made an appointment for 10:00 AM - I don't know why.  I don't think they touched our 2013 Sportage until 1:30 or so.  They said the diagnostic would take an hour and they would call and let us know.  THAT DD NOT HAPPEN!!!!  WE CALLED AT 12:30 and then the receptionist told us our ""service guy, Rick was at lunch and would be back at 2:30"".  We finally spoke to someone and they said our car had ""lean intake"" issues - NOT COVERED UNDER WARRANTY - and the car would be ready at 3:00.  They called us at 2 and said - NO NO NO - it's a whole different issue.  WORST SERVICE EVER!!!  THEY DON'T CARE AND ARE BORDERING ON FRAUD.",1.4
282,"December 21, 2015",Walk in one late night and started talking to the first salesman I seen. Gave him all my information and ever time I need to get an update I had to call everyday. After almost a week and talking to a manager he told me he would see what's going on and call me back...and never did. After going through the weekend I finally got in contact with the manager he really didn't have an update... their communication sucks.,1.2
283,"November 11, 2015","First, they didn’t have my car ready for delivery when promised. They gave me a loaner car with a bad tire that blew out on me after about 20 miles. They broke the antenna that they had previously fixed, and never ordered the part to fix it. They sent me home with a vehicle that did not pass the state inspection, and basically said oops. Then after 3 months and 1 oil change, my engine locks up due to sludge build up. Even though the warranty would not cover this because it is due to poor maintenance (before I purchased the car), Westside Kia says that it is my responsibility because I did not purchase a warranty. They did not properly inspect my vehicle before selling it or delivering it. They also did not properly inspect the vehicle they gave me as a loaner. I am very disappointed that they refuse to stand up and take responsibility for their poor service department. The service manager actually stated that he cannot possibly be responsible for every vehicle that comes in!",1.4
284,"September 16, 2015",I spoke with internet rep and she wasn't able to help.  I asked her to get me a price on my trade-in for a 2016 Sorento and she kept pushing that aside.  She lost my business since I purchased a fully loaded 2016 from Fredy Kia.,2.0
285,"July 09, 2015","I have taken my Soul in 3 times for the same issue (very rough downshifting when slowing and braking). First visit, they determined the brakes were fine. (Yes, they were, but that was not the issue!) second visit resulted in a new transmission, but did not solve the problem.  The result of the third visit is that ""the official position of the dealership is that there isn't a problem.""   

The car handles markedly different from the way it did several months ago. It does not feel safe. Even my granddaughter notices, and she doesn't want to ride in it. And you do nothing.  

So, Kia, I'm guessing that it is perfectly ok for your wife or child or grandchild to drive or ride in an unsafe car.  Want to buy one? I'll sell you mine.

286,"January 20, 2013","I took my car for a recall and left the dealer with a kick in back bumper. Management refused to take any responsibility of their acts. They alleged that my car was damaged before service but, they have no prove of that because they did not noted on the inspection sheet. My mistake was not inspected my vehicle when service was completed thinking I was making business with honest people. 

Westside chevrolet has the worst customer service they don't even say ""hi"" unless you say it, this is how bad they are. I do not recommend any body to have or visit this place for your car service.",1.0
287,"July 26, 2012",I have had to use this dealership for parts since we live in katy but this one man has been unfriendly and nasty every time i have visited the dealership.  I honestly think he has a problem with women and treats them badly.  On my last visit the service person i dealt with after talking with Able was great and made a bad situation better.  I would not recommend anyone deal with the parts department.  Myself i have decided to drive down Katy Freeway and use the next Chevy dealer for all of my parts needs.,1.8
288,"July 03, 2011","I would never recommend this dealership to anybody! They operate on what I would call a ""bait and switch tactic."" I email a quote on a base optima ex online and Rick Hall gave me a really good price $21,550. I drove over 40 miles to Westside Kia and Rick told me that he didn't have the car that I wanted. He insisted that I test drive the one with the navigation and technology package and if I like it he would give me the internet price for the car. I test drove the car and he gave me the sale price of $27,987 which Rick said he sold it to me for $200 less than invoice. I found out later that I had paid over MSRP because at that time there wasn't a car price sticker posted on one of the car's window like they normally do. I will never buy from this dealer again. Stay far away from this dealer!",2.2
289,"May 04, 2011",I took my truck in for service and they couldn't fix my two issues and actually made one worse and when I answered unsatisfied on the chevy survey it some how became my fault! Then they refused to service my vehicle after that. The worst service and William the S.A. Is the worst to deal with. Do not ever go here even to buy one!!!,2.3
