0,"August 16, 2018","I had the displeasure of deal with Saleman Tom Hager... I asked a simple question about leasing and getting a tax credit off the sales tax because another dealership in lubbock gave me a sale tax credit of $600 off the final cost. When I text him he replied, ""Man I'm not a tax consultant""... no need to be rude. However, this made me want to do business elsewhere. A salesman is suppose to be there for the customer not the other way around... maybe he needs more train on his job...",1.4

2,"August 02, 2017","My worst nightmare experience EVER in owning a car. Subaru Outback.
Still in shock over problems with my car, still under warranty, service department, all crooks. Since then I have heard bad things about owner not caring so why would employees.  I paid a HIGH price over buying a car from BROWN Subaru!!!! Not one person tried to help me. I now own a GMC PRODUCT NOT purchased from BROWN.",1.2
3,"July 06, 2017","At some point to expect the established used car dealers to be fair with the price as opposed to make every dime they can from the customer. Bought a used Subaru Forester and found out they overcharged me by $2000 over the used car retail price. Will not shop with them again. Internet be aware. Sadly honesty is dead at this dealership.

4,"December 15, 2016","We did not end up purchasing through Brown because of the terrible experience we had with them. They did not even want to look at my trade and give me an estimated trade value unless I committed to signing on their car today. Mitch (the salesman) stated that he did not want them to go through the work of giving me a quote on it if I wasn't going to sign on their car today. They finally gave me an offer for my truck. They had not come off of the sticker price on the car I wanted though. After telling them what I needed/expected from my trade, and how much I planned on paying for the new car, he again stated that he did not want to go take the numbers I wanted to his sales manager and ""ask for a favor"" unless I would commit to signing today. They just treated me as if I was inconveniencing them by wanting to purchase a vehicle through them. It was not a pleasant experience at all. I would highly suggest staying away from Brown Subaru.",1.0

6,"November 28, 2015","bought a 2016 WRX STI from Amarillo Brown Subaru and when I bought it, it had a crack on the windshield but I didn't find out until an HOUR after I signed all the papers and pulled out of the lot. 

I tried to bring it back to see if they could do anything about it but the service manager and dealer wasn't interested in providing me any help. The service manager actually joked with the dealer about it as I was 20 feet away but I couldn't hear what they were saying.

After not getting any help I drove 106 miles home with a crack on my windshield that grew to 3 ft.  

I ended up paying $400 out of pocket to get the windshield fixed but it was a 2 week wait. It doesn't stop there. I began having some whining noises from my vehicle and attempted to contact the service manager 3-4 times but no one was there to answer my questions so I left a voice mail for a call back. 
 
A week passed and I hadn't received a call from them so I took it up to Subaru Of America where they not only reimbursed me my $400 I paid for my windshield but they also provided me EXCELLENT customer and answered all the questions I had about my car.

As a active duty member of the United States Air Force, I WOULDN'T recommend anyone going to Brown Subaru of Amarillo for their next purchase unless you want to deal with people who only want to make commission and have nothing to do with you after you walk out their front door. ",1.4
7,"February 16, 2011","We are online shoppers; we do our reviews and searches on vehicles before buying. We walk on the lot with financing in hand and then shop prices, deals, but most of all sales people! We were very pleased with the purchase experience of our new Subaru in Amarillo, Texas at Brown Subaru.  Chris Cooksey let ""us"" do the shopping and decision on our purchase. We arrived while it was snowing, test drove the vehicle and even called to tell him we were leaning toward another choice at another lot, but thank you anyway. He was very courteous, even knowing we were not buying there after-all. We went to the other lot and were turned off immediately by the sales tactics of the other lot and called Chris back to return buying from Subaru instead! We are so glad we made the choice that night to buy at Subaru and they were ""never pushy"" and always allowed ""us"" to make choices that fit our needs and likes.  Thank you Chris for your great service!
We will be returning for our free detail of the car & free gas too...what a deal! These are great folks to work with. ",5.0
