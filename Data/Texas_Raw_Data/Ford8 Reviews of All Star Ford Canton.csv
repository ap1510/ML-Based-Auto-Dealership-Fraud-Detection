0,"April 26, 2020","Went online shopping for a possible new vehicle for my wife. Filled out a questioner of what I was looking for and within a day or two, received a call from a sales rep. I text the guy as he requested and gave him a list of ALL the things I was looking for. (model,options,price etc etc....) Come to find out the guy had been laid off due to dealership not having enough business. I received a call from Mickey Vogt (sales manager) He stated ""he received my not that I had given to the laid off employee, and to come in and speak with Jeremy Ragle"". Drove in that weekend and Jeremy already had 2 vehicles pulled to the front for us to test drive and look over. (awesome) Needless to say my wife was like a kid in a candy store and wanted to look around. We/she had looked online and found a vehicle for 31k. They finally found THAT vehicle on the lot and brought it up for a test drive, but needed gas first. Test drove the vehicle and liked it enough to go in and make a deal. instead of dealing with Jeremy at this point, we were directed to Mr.Vogt. This is one of those guys that says he has been in the business for a Billion years and knows his stuff. I had previously told this fellow I found the same vehicle for 28k at Rockwall Ford and was told ""oh, theres no way...I've checked the entire United States inventory and NO ONE has lower prices. I should have gone with my gut at that point but proceeded on. Mickey looked over our trade in and gave us 7k on something that was upside down at 9k. We sat there and sat there in his very small office space. The vehicle that we looked up for 31k ended up being 34k per Mickey and he told us that they do that to get ppl in the door. (false advertisement in my book) He would show me his computer screen to say ""look how honest I am, I'm showing you my screen and no one else would ever do that he says"".
Ford at that time was advertising a 3 month EXTRA deferred payment program and I mentioned this to Mickey and he stated ""oh, that hasn't come in yet, I haven't gotten a memo"". He didn't even check to see if we could get the darn thing. After walking away from him 3 times I decided to do it. Vehicle wasn't detailed at the time but dealership was closed after being there 3-4hrs of negotiating. Never got a call to say bring the new undetailed vehicle in so they could clean it up after paying 1k down for their service. Vehicle has a ""driver mode"" issue about 2weeks later and wife brings to dealership, drops hers off and gets a loaner. Nothing was found wrong after a 30 something mile test drive. Go to pick up the vehicle and the NEW vehicle was left muddy and with very little gas. My wife HAD TO COMPLAIN to get the car washed and have gas added considering she put gas in the loaner as well.
All in all, ""we treat you like family at all star ford"" yes, but they don't say it's a dysfunctional family. Jeremy Ragle was cool. Mickey is an unprofessional know it all. Not the best experience shop else where.",2.0

4,"April 05, 2019","I highly recommend All Star Ford, Canton, TX if you are looking to buy a new car or truck.
 I recently purchased a new F150 XLT. After I took delivery I found that the truck did not have the engine that I had requested. Upon returning to All Star and explaining the problem, Shane Stovall (sales) and John Boyd (gen. manager) took over and found the correct truck, even though it required a great deal of actions and paperwork on  their end, I am very pleased to have the truck I wanted. 
""FIVE STARS"" to All Star Ford, Canton, TX.",5.0

6,"February 12, 2016","My daughter and I was test driving someone else's vehicle and pulled into AllStar Ford. The representative came straight out and introduced himself as ""Spanky"" lol. I told him what I was wanting and he immediately started asking questions to get me into what I wanted. He let me test drive whatever I wanted until I found the perfect one I wanted. He was the nicest person to deal with. He answered all our questions fully and it never felt like he was pushing me into something. He has called and texted to make sure I was happy with my new truck. I will definitely go back there for my next vehicle.",5.0
7,"February 02, 2016",I took my daughters car in mid December for front end work and was told it needed outer tie-rods and and an alignment.  The car had 122K miles so that was not a surprise.  The did the work ($1200) and returned the car.  Five weeks later the car wonders all over the road and they say it needs inner tie-rods.  Tie-rods do not go from being good to bad in less than 1000 miles.  They no longer had a front end mechanic so they had to take it to another shop to have the alignment done.  Worn parts and work that should have been completed on the first visit have now incurred additional labor charges for billed again for alignment because their mechanic failed to fully correct the problem the first time. They understood the frustration buy offered to do nothing about it.,2.0
