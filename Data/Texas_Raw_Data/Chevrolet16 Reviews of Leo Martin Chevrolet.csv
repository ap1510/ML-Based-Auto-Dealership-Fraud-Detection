0,"December 14, 2019","After saying they could repair our Cadillac's leak and spending almost $6000 our vehicle is worse off than before. We tried taking it back but they decided to wait us out by ignoring it and let it sit in their lot. The first time it took 12 weeks and cost us a battery this time I refused to let Leo Martin take advantage of us again.
All I can say to the people of Lake Jackson "" Go elsewhere to buy your Chevy this isn't the dealership Leo Martin built """,1.0

2,"February 05, 2019","I brought my car to the collision center and was told the repair would take 3-4 days. It didn't. Every time I called to see if my car was ready they would tell me that it would be done in just a couple more days, but it never was. They had no explanation other than it would just take a little longer. They never called me to tell me of a delay, they just waited for me to call them, and about half the time they were unpleasant when I asked why it was taking so long. Finally, after four weeks, they called to say my car was ready. When I arrived an hour later they apologized and said that it wasn't ready, but it would be ready tomorrow. They kept my car for four weeks and a day. My advice is this: Do not ever do business with Leo Martin Chevrolet. I certainly won't.",1.6

4,"October 07, 2017","I was driving from Oklahoma City to lake Jackson and my oil life monitor flashed 0% so it said to change oil soon. I pulled into this dealer at 430 pm hoping to get an oil change. I was first advised that all the oil techs were done for the day and referred to a jiffy lube down the street. Just before I left the service area  Steven Busch, a service adviser came over and told me that he had found a late working tech that would do the oil change for me. He offered me a bottle of water and a seat in the reception area. He understood my urgency and he went out of his way to find a solution. In 30 min I was on my way at a good price. Thank you Steven Busch for great customer service. What a great service department.",5.0
5,"August 05, 2017",They lied to me several times ! I've bought two new vehicles from there but never again. They will say anything to make a sale! Go to another dealer!,1.0
6,"June 28, 2017",I took my car that I bought 4 yrs ago in to get worked on.  They not only got it done but did it in a timely fashion and with super service.   Thank you for taking such good care of my favorite car.  I have been doing business with this family owned buisness for 25 years and plan to for the next 25 years.,5.0
7,"June 12, 2017","Our college age daughter needed a car sooner than expected, and after talking to Richard, we found the perfect car for her. His service, along with Jason and Reagan's advise helped us make the desission to purchase a Chevy Cruze.  Would certainly recommend Leo Martin Chevrolet if you are in the need for a new or used car!

8,"June 05, 2017","I told Terry exactly what I was looking for. He called to let me know they have it in stock and asked when I would like to come in and look at it. After my test drive and negotiating price, I left and told him to have the vehicle and paperwork ready in the morning. I was in and out. Easiest buying experience!",5.0
9,"June 01, 2017","We were very satisfied with the sales service we received from Jason, Reagan, and Terry. We could not have asked for better response to our questions, especially given that we were not local to Leo Martin's dealership and needed to work most of the buying process telephonically and via email/text. Reagan was so patient with us. He responded in a timely manner to every question we posed. Terry spent at least an hour just going over the operation of the vehicle with us and made sure we were comfortable before sending us on our way back to San Antonio. Jason took care of all the paperwork and made sure we were aware of all the warranty options, but at the same time did not pressure us to buy anything. Just an overall great experience. I would definitely consider Leo Martin for any future GM purchase.",5.0

11,"August 01, 2014","A huge Thank you to Steve Lloyd  for helping me with a warranty issue on my 2011 Cadillac SRX.
My car was being serviced at another dealership and was 300 miles over my bumper to bumper warranty.  The OTHER dealership would not budge from the $1875 cost to fix my car.  
Steve gave the the 800 number to CADILLAC WARRANTY and to make a long story short...they AGREED the work should be covered!!!  Saving me $1875!!!
LEO MARTIN has the best employees for going over and beyond for customers!

12,"July 25, 2014","Every time our Trail Blazer requires service (and that is quite often but that's a whole other post) we have taken it to Leo Martin Chevrolet - Lake Jackson as that is where we purchased the vehicle.  I figured that meant they knew it best and could service it best.  Wrong assumptions on my part.  Our latest experience, dropped it off to change out a bad cam/actator valve and replace the track on the front passenger window.  They had the car for a week and only fixed the cam/actator valve.  Window track not replaced.  ""Person that does that is on vacation"".  You couldn't tell me that when I dropped it off?  You have no one else qualified to perform this work?

Upon picking up the car, the fuel gauge no longer works.  ""Not our fault; it just went bad.  We'd be glad to order you a new one and get it installed"".  So now our original ""$330"" job (warning - the job cost they quote you is parts only), has turned into a $1,000+ job.

They can change your oil (although I will no longer even use them for this) but do not trust Leo Martin Chevrolet Service for ant significant other work.  They are slow, poor quality, will brake other things during their work, and not take responsibility for what they caused.

We also will never purchase another automobile from Leo Martin Chevrolet.",1.6
13,"July 16, 2014","just purchased a used car. salesman offered three cars that fit my needs. nice presentation of each and answered all questions. got down to only two to choose from. no pressure, was rtold to choose one and if i decided in a few days on the other one i could change my mind. GREAT PLACE AND PEOPLE TO DEAL WITH.",5.0
14,"April 15, 2013","Our salesman, Frankie, did a great job at promising things to get the sale.  When it comes down to what we agreed on (free oil changes because the car didn't have a key-less entry and the dealership couldn't put one in) he won't return my phone calls and hangs up when I do get him on the phone.  I am disappointed in his overall customer service.  He has been dodging my phone calls for two weeks.  I've had to call him several times and left him numerous voice mails to please return my phone call and he never did.  I got a text message from him saying ""He still not here, it will be Monday."" Well, Monday has come and gone and he fell back on his word, YET AGAIN.  I will not be going to this dealership nor will I recommend it to anyone.  I am very dissatisfied and disgusted with the lack of attention my situation has been handled.  ",2.2
15,"January 20, 2012","Took my car in for warranty work.  They kept it for three days and never even ordered a part because the service manager was not there.  Finally, after they did order the part, i never heard from them.  They never called back and wouldn't return my calls.  When i finally did get in touch with Steve, the service manager, over a week later, he told me that they would not do any work on my car because i had filled out a customer service survey, and they were not happy with my survey answers!!  how can a Chevy dealership refuse to do work on a car under warranty just because of a survey that you were honest on?  GM shouldn't send out these surveys if this is what happens to customers who are honest on the survey!",1.0
