Did not make me feel rushed. Sent me cars I might be interested in via email. This dealership is the best in Central Texas. This is why I always come back to Cleo Bay Honda!,5.0
1,"March 28, 2020","Absolutely love Kirby and Matt in finance. They made everything quick and easy. I walked in at 9:30 and by 11:00 my car was going to get detailed. I‚Äôve never seen anything like it. I will always recommend my friends go to Cleo Bay. Perfect does not begin to describe my experience. I loved every second of my visit. Even with my two month old son Kirby and Matt went above and beyond to make everything as quick as possible. I literally had to ask for nothing because I was told everything before I could even think of a question to ask. Loved, loved, LOVED my entire car buying experience!",5.0

3,"January 12, 2020","When buying a new vehicle, I'm always anxious, but working with Kirby Bonheim was a wonderful experience.  I drove to Killeen from Dallas and thought the whole time this might be a wasted trip.  Kirby made the sale happen - very engaging and professional .  If you're looking for a new Honda, Kirby is the one.  You'll get the car you want!

4,"June 08, 2019",Avoid Cleo Bay Honda in Killeen especially their Service Department. I took my 2002 Honda CRV there on 11/26/2017 to have all the lock nuts replaced on all the tires as the lug nut key was missing and they claimed they completed the job. On 06/06/2017 I had a blowout and went to remove the spare tire to replace the flat tire and Cleo Bay of Killeen‚Äôs Service Department neglected to replace the locking nut on the spare tire so the new lug nut key they provided did not fit the locking lug nut on the spare tire so I could not fix the flat. I had to get my car owed to a Walmart at 11:00pm at night as I was 60 miles from home and my Girlfriend and I were stuck at Walmart for 8 hours until the Automotive Department opened. I got the tire replaced and drove to Cleo Bay in Killeen to get reimbursed for the towing s it was their fault I had to get the car towed since they were negligent in not replace the locking lug nut on the spare tire and they refused to take responsibility for their mistake and basically told me to go ahead and take them  to court if I wanted them to pay fir their negligent error. I am looking into legal action as I am out 240.00 for towing that I would not have paid except for their negligence. ,1.0
5,"May 01, 2019","Arrived at Cleo Bay Honda at about 7:30am on  April 30th. Came to get an oil change and tire rotation. The guy in service who took care of me, didn‚Äôt introduce himself. The paper work says advisor was Ross Grimes.   Here is a list of issues I experienced 

1.  Service guy told me the car was not ready for oil change. It has 2150ish miles.  Bought it brand new 9 months ago. Oil life indicator said 15%.  He argued with me the computer says 25%. I told him I live in Temple and coming to Cleo Bay is a hassle, I want to get it done. He relented. 

Later that night, I get into my vehicle to go to work. Its dark outside..

2.  My lights are all turned off.  Headlights, fog lights, interior lights.  Tablet and red circle ignition button are super bright.  I am like ok this isn‚Äôt right.  I have to fiddle around and put all my lights back to where they should be.  

3.  I drive to work.  Turn AC on.   Its on full blast, and the button to pull air from outside ( bottom left console area ) is on.  This was not how I have these set. 

I come in to get a simple oil change and tire rotation. Why are all of my lights and AC settings fiddled with?  I give you guys my vehicle to do basic maintenance, why am I not getting it back the way it was given?

7,"August 24, 2018"," My wife was traveling through Killeen and experienced transmission issues, which forced her to find the nearest Honda / Acura dealership.  When she arrived at Cleo Bay Honda, a ""technician"" came out to assist her.  He noted that the transmission was dry, and there was ""fluid everywhere under vehicle"".  He then proceeded to tell my wife that it WAS transmission fluid, but that it was coming from the power steering reservoir, which was overflowing with the wrong fluid (somehow, not only was the wrong fluid in the power steering pump, but it was also overflowing).  They gave her a loaner, so she could get where she needed to be, and called the next day with the good news that it was fixed.  She returned the loaner, and was told the transmission and power steering were both flushed, refilled, and she was good to go.  She paid the $407.00 bill, and didn't make it 20 miles away from the dealership when the transmission ran dry again, overheated, which in turn overheated the engine, and blew both the transmission AND the engine.  I had to rent a trailer and tow her car back to Dallas late that night.  The dealership here in Dallas said it appeared to be grossly misdiagnosed in Killeen (if it arrived at Cleo Bay Honda with a ""dry"" transmission, and fluid all over the ground......common sense would say there's likely a massive leak somewhere).  But there was no mention of a leak on Cleo Bay Honda's invoice.  I plead my case to the General Manager (Brian) and Service Manager (Rodney), at Cleo Bay Honda, but was told they investigated my case, and see no wrong doing on their part.  As a peace offering though, they refunded us $200, of our $407 bill.  So in summary, my wife left our house in a vehicle worth $10,000, and returned with an $8,700 bill (basically, a totaled vehicle).",1.0

9,"July 20, 2017","I purchased a new Honda CRV on Aug 2016 from Cleo Bay Honda, Killeen. I was told at the time I bought the vehicle (Aug 2016)  along with email confirmation dated 08/08/16 that I will be getting free service for 1 year or upto 20,000 miles from this dealership. Today 07/20/17, I went to do my free service in 13400 miles, the service advisor said, they wont provide any more free service eventhough they promised along with written confirmation that I will be getting free service for 1 year or upto 20,000 miles. The service advisor then redirected me to the sales manager and they said, they wont provide any more free service as thats the General Manager decision. I had written email confirmation that I had 1 year or upto 20,000 miles free service from this dealership. They just ignored all this. 

I even had better deals from various Honda dealership in Houston. But I went here with a thought of near to my location. Stay away from this people. They will give all impossible promises which they are not going to provide. Honesty & Integrity is not something cannot buy from the market and they dont have any ethics in the business which they does. I do not recommend doing business with this dealership.

10,"March 17, 2017","Our purchase of this Honda Odyssey was one of the easiest in all my years of car buying. Our Sales Rep Kathy Culin was on top of everything right from our initial contact answering all our questions and taking care of business. Cleo Bay Honda is a 5 Star dealership in my opinion, they handled their business in a very professional  manor making sure everything was taken care of  leaving nothing exposed. As requested, they handled everything up front so we were actually in the dealership less than an hour. Great job Kathy and Cleo Bay Honda!",5.0

15,"September 14, 2016","This was my first purchase and Cleo helped me with a genuine experience! I was so unsure about what I wanted and she helped me look through many cars until I found the one I wanted! I fell in love with the accord sport instantly.

All I have to do is drive over there sign the papers and I am out of there. There is never a hassle. Elaine has been doing this for years and she knows what she's doing. She never pulls any punches and I always get exactly what I want. She has never tried to sell me anything I did not want and we have got at least 6 cars from her. She is just so easy to work with.

While they had many of the car that I wanted, apparently there had been a recall on several of them, which reduced the inventory available significantly. That's the manufacturer's fault and not the dealership, though. The only concern I had at all was that the price of the same car on their website was less than when I arrived at the dealership (within 5% difference). I was still interested in the vehicle, and went through with purchasing it, though. Happy to have worked with them and gotten the car I wanted!",4.8

It truly starts from having a great sales person like Johnny Walker that made the whole process smoothly. Especially since this was my first time buying a car all on my own.

39,"February 21, 2016","This is our third vehicle purchased from Cleo Bay Honda in Killeen, Texas. Each time the sales personal were very courteous and friendly. This last visit the sales personal was Edwin Williams. He was very knowledgeable and understandable in considering our needs and budget for a vehicle for our youngest daughter, who is still in High school. The dealership had some very nice, clean, and moderately priced vehicles. My wife and I really felt at home at Cleo Bay Honda and the people there try to help you, however they can. No high pressure sales talk. Edwin listened and helped us in finding the right vehicle for our daughter. We will continue to be a repeat customer and will refer this dealership to all our neighbors and friends.

48,"November 10, 2015","Just purchased a 2014 Accord.  First car purchase was in 1951 with many in between including 2 Accords.  This was the best buying experience ever.  Terry Treece was great; knew his product, sensitive to our needs, ready to demonstrate vehicle features of interest, but allowed us to make the decision (not pushy with comments like ""Great opportunity, want be here tomorrow!).  In addition, he was friendly, and easy to deal with.  
But the factor that meant much to me and was evident throughout our conversations, was his comments about Cleo Bay Honda and the way ""we do things.""  This told me he enjoyed his work, was proud of the company and that he would be around if I ever needed him.
It was our good fortune that Terry so quickly responded to our email inquiry and then to meet and deal with him.

I am a avid Honda owner. Recently purchasing my 7th Honda, I keep going back to the Honda car because of its durability, low maintenance and reliability.
From service department to sales I am totally pleased. Over the years since I have been in Texas - Kimberly Smith my sales representative has been personable, responsive and attentive. Its not just with the sale, its with the relationship.
Because she has maintained the relationship....when I went in for service, unfortunately  repair was not the option - it was Kimberly who discussed the possibility of a new car.

61,"May 20, 2015","I was very pleased with my vehicle and my sales person. I purchased a brand new car with the help of Elaine Cloud. She is one of a kind AWESOME. It took me some time to decide and she was very patient even when I was not. Cleo Bay Honda is a one of kind dealership! I had just purchased a 2015 Honda Odyssey.
When we decided on a Honda Odyssey, I contacted Elaine via email with what we wanted. After a couple email exchanges to confirm information, she came back with an offer that no dealer in Austin or Round Rock could meet. I called to confirm that her offer was legitimate and she said yes so we agreed to the offer. We went to the dealership to sign the papers and it was the most stress-free car buying experience I have ever had. We walked in, they confirmed the numbers on a worksheet/Purchase Order and 20 minutes later we were signing documents with the Finance Manager, ""Mac"". We also opted for the extended warranty because we plan on keeping the car for a long time. He is an awesome guy and was very patient with me when I was deciding what to take and what not to...:). We do opt for glass coat after he explains the importance of it. After applying this glass coat they delivered it to our house at no additional charge! Folks, I friendly suggestion is if you want to buy a Honda, contact Elaine at Cleo Bay. She was very aggressive in making sure we got the best car for the best price with the best financing all while keeping the buying experience easy as possible!

He was very patient even to the point of waiting for her to decide the color of the car she wanted.  She is very happy with her car and I was so pleased with the service that in less than a week I took my grandson back to Cleo Bay Honda to let him pick out his first new car.  Once again Terry Treece was very patient while he decided on which car if it should be, an automatic or manual transmission and the color he would choose.  My grandson now has his car which he really loves.  Terry made sure that my daughter and grandson have his contact number so if they have any questions about their new car they could call or text and he would help them with their questions.  I am very pleased with the service we received from our first moment of interest in buying a new car to the final purchases of both vehicles.  I could not find a better dealership or sales representative.  Thank you for showing my daughter and grandson how a sales representative should treat each potential buyer who walks in the dealership door.",5.0
64,"March 22, 2015","Ordered 2015 CR-V through Elaine Cloud in Internet Sales at Cleo Bay Honda.
As this was our 1st Honda we originally engaged our local Honda dealership and I almost walked away from Honda due to poor salesmanship and management.  This was not the case at Cleo Bay.
Elaine listened to our specs and due to us requesting a particular color with the Touring and AWD, she informed us how difficult it was to get this vehicle.  But she delivered what we requested.  Honda does not make it easy to get the type of car you want if it is out of the norm for the area.
While our local dealership failed miserably, Elaine was able to get our car within a month or our request.  She kept us informed on the progress, continued to answer questions, and rewarded us with a higher trade-in value and included accessories at no cost that we were going to get.  It doesn't get any better than this. The drive out of area was well worth it.   We were in and out of the dealership in about 2 hours.  Elaine did all the front end work and got it all correct.  An hour of the time was divided between Finance and Sales instructions on the features in the car.  
For the feature discussion Darrin Renke spent over 40 minutes going over the buttons, displays, and initial preference setups which was really helpful and much more than when we had purchased our Toyota.  Keith was our finance interface and did a good job of explaining the different packages available.  However, I reviewed the extended warranty's and asked specific questions on the Highest level package coverage.  I was not surprised that Keith could not answer if a particular part was covered.  Keith did call to check out my request and even the party that he talked to could not answer whether a part was covered or not.  I find it interesting that they give you a list (which is not comprehensive) and then tell you things are covered even though there  is no proof that it is and when pressed to put it in writing they waive there hands and say they can't do that so buyer beware.  I did end up purchasing the top package for extended warranty and will write a response if things are not covered.
Ending this on a positive note, I would not go to another dealership if your in the central texas area.  This dealership is OUTSTANDING.  They took the time to make my order easy and worry free.  I HIGHLY recommend CLEO BAY HONDA, ELAINE CLOUD (Internet Sales), and Darrin Renke (Sales) for there service, thoroughness, and customer care.",5.0

I did my purchase online completely and never visited the dealership because they are around 60 miles away from my home. I am in Cedar Park, TX. Terry worked with me.  what I can review for Terry's service are 3 words: Excellent, Excellent, Excellent !!! Terry is really a nice and patient guy to work with. I started my online quote on 01/31/2015, which was Saturday. Terry is the first one to answer me and give me a good price with warm welcome message. He also explained to me how his price came from (invoice price + extra holding due to high demand of CR-V).  Although that price is not lowest, he would like to do a competitive review and adjust that final price a little bit lower after I sent him another lower quote. We communicated via emails for over 40 times back and forth and I asked a lot of detailed questions. Terry was always very patient and answered each of my question in details. He never pushed me to purchase anything. Finally, after I visited several local dealerships, I decided to go with Cleo Bay. Due to my requirement of AWD, Terry and Cleo Bay provided a free locate service and moved that car from another dealership (Waco or San Antonio, I am not completely sure), then delivery that car to my home. So, on Friday morning (02/12/2015), I stayed at home and received my home. I am fully satisfied with my car and the service from Terry and Cleo Bay. There were some minors issues after the car delivery (The driver forgot giving me the car manual and two tile registration forms). Terry immediately sent those to me via FedEx overnight on the same day and provide me the tracking number in time. I really felt very well to work with these guys. I definitely recommend Terry and Cleo bay to my family and my friend. ",4.8

I worked with Terry Treece through the whole process from initially finding the car through their website, starting a discussion on stock and options for acquiring cars from other dealers all the way to pricing and negotiation. It was fantastic to work with Terry, doing most of our communication through email, since it's tough for me to take calls during the work day.

Terry was completely upfront and transparent with all details throughout the process. He was able to get me a great price that matched my demands and expectations even though they didn't have one on the lot. After agreeing on the price, Terry and his team went out and found the exact car I was looking for, brought it back, cleaned it up and got me set up with all the bells and whistles I was looking for.

74,"November 05, 2014","We were looking at new cars on the internet and requested that a dealer contact us with a quote. We were put into contact with Elaine Cloud at Cleo Bay who contacted us right away via email introducing herself and stating that they would be very competitive with dealers in the Austin area. When we decided on a Honda Accord EX, I contacted Elaine via email with what we wanted and what we were trading in. After a couple email exchanges to confirm information, she came back with an offer that no dealer in Austin or Round Rock could meet. I called to confirm that her offer was legitimate and she said yes so we agreed to the offer. The only trouble was that they didn't have the car in stock but she found one in Houston to bring in. But, we were saving a lot of money so that was OK. We went to the dealership to sign the papers and it was the most stress-free car buying experience I have ever had. We walked in, they confirmed the numbers on a worksheet/Purchase Order and 20 minutes later we were signing documents with the Finance Manager, ""Mac"". We also opted for the extended warranty because we plan on keeping the car for a long time. I had priced extended warranties with my credit union and the one through Cleo Bay was through was less expensive, covers everything except stains scratches and normal maintenance items and is through Allstate Insurance. They gave us a loaner car to drive until ours came in from Houston. In the meantime, they were able to get us financed with American Honda for an even better rate than our credit union and we switched financing to American Honda. When our car came in, they delivered it to our house at no additional charge! Folks, if you are wanting to buy a Honda, contact Elaine at Cleo Bay. She was very aggressive in making sure we got the best car for the best price with the best financing all while keeping the buying experience easy as possible!",5.0

About 5 years ago my wife purchased a new Honda Accord from Elaine Cloud and had a very pleasant experience.  Last month, when I decided to look at a new Accord myself, we went by to see if by chance she still worked there.  Not only were we happy to find that she still worked there, we were blown away that she remembered my wife and her field of work.  Ms. Cloud was professional and a pleasure to work with.  She was patient and supportive as I looked at different finance deals and compared local prices.  Despite learning of a condition with my trade that decreased its value, she worked with us to provide what I believe was a fair deal on our trade-in.  When a deal was agreed upon, I felt very good with it and felt confident that Ms. Cloud had worked hard to provide me with the best car and price available.  I then met with Mr. Neil Farris who also was professional and efficient making the finance portion of the day quick and painless.

82,"March 24, 2014","This has been the happiest and easiest car buying experience, ever, starting with my first e-mail response from Elaine Cloud.  We are big Honda fans and have bought most of them from Austin, since we live here.  We have passed a few down to our children.  This time, I  began preliminary shopping while my husband was out of town, which included a test drive of the Crosstour, here in Austin.  It was getting the dealership to negotiate on a price, where things got bogged down.  Basically, I never got a counter offer.  I began to contact other dealerships.  Elaine gave me a price which was much lower and in addition,  threw in some free amenities, the first time  I asked what the best deal was she could give me.  In the meantime, other dealers would call and leave messages on my phone, and when I called back, they were busy, and I was  transfered to another sales person, Ihad never met, and get the same 21 questions.  But no one seemed interested in putting an offer on the table, when I asked.   Meanwhile, I had been submitting questions to Elaine, who was giving me her full attention.  Darren Renke also contacted me from time to time through e-mail to see how things were going.  But really I was getting full satisfaction talking to Elaine.  Once I decided on the model and profile of the car, I told her, we'd have to wait until my husband came back and we looked at finances together.  I never once felt pressured.  I was not getting spam e-mail from her about how I was doing.  Every e-mail was in response to one I had sent, and when I said I had all the info I needed and that I'd contact her again when we were ready, once again, there was no pressure, and she didn't contact me until I contacted her.  Once I told her we were ready, she said she could get us in and out in 30 mins (ok, it was really 45, but we didn't mind).  She knew this was 90 minute drive, we had to make, one way, and we had to get back to work that afternoon.  She was really professional, greeted us, had the car prepped and ready.  We filled out the contract, and then walked in to see the financial guy, who got us a better interest rate than we expected, BONUS!  As soon as we were done there, she walked us out to the car, hooked up my blue tooth, showed me how everything worked, help me to get everything set for the ride home.  I could not believe how easy this was.  I'm completely satisfied with the type of customer service AND the price, and the interest rate, AND I really do love this car.  It drives better than any Accord we have owned and loved in the past.  Honda DOES keep getting better.  The drive to Cleo Bay is worth it.  Its much better than spending hours on the lot, waiting, and wondering what's taking so long and if things are going to work out as planned.  Everything was planned on this sale, before hand.  All they needed was my signature, down payment and the rest of them time was focused on me and my car getting to know eachother.  I'll never do things the old way again, when it comes to buying a car.  Elaine really brought me into the millenium about seamless car purchases.  I'm loving it!   Thanks Elaine! ",5.0

Despite our stupid decisions, we brought our situation to Cleo Bay where we spent a few days crunching numbers with them.  They researched our trade-in by calling dealerships all over Central Texas (to include Austin) to see how much we could get for it elsewhere.  They ended up matching the greatest value of our trade-in, and then some.  They were very open with us about where all of their numbers were coming from and were very clear.  In the end, we bought a brand new Honda Odyssey, got about 4k off MSRP through their no-hassle guarantee, and ended up with over 12k less debt overall.

This is my 3rd car that I have bought from this dealership and I will definetely come back for the 4th. Thanks Cleo Bay Honda!",5.0
112,"April 10, 2012","Darrin Renke and Cleo Bay Honda are the best. After a lot of research of all the dealers in our area we drove 90 minutes from Austin to give them our business. They were priced well below all the other dealers and their customer service was the best! They were worth the drive. I highly recommend them!

She was able to deliver to us a quality product at a resonable price.  Our new vehicle, a 2012 Honda Accord, came from an out of town dealer.  Our purchase from its beginning to delivery was flawlessy executed by Ms. Mirabel and the vehicle was in the condition promised. ",5.0
116,"March 09, 2012","The friendliness at the dealership was outstanding. Overall experience was the best of any dealership i have ever vistied. Gene Beltz was just great to work with, no pressure just good salesmenship and friendliness. I thought the price of my lease was fair compared with other dealers.",4.8
117,"March 02, 2012","Elaine, Sheila were exceptionally thorough in explaining the purchase process, Elaine explained the functions of the navigation system, the hands free link, imported my phone into the system and went over all the features of the automobile. Steve in service was very helpful with the installation of the rearview mirror. Keith, the business manager also was extremely helpful, courteous. The purchase of our Honda Accord Coupe was the most pleasant buying experience of all our automobile purchases.
Thanks, Cleo Honda",5.0

He was very friendly and knowledgeable about the 2012 Odyssey. He spent alot of time explaining the features before we even took it for a test drive, and afterwards worked with us to get what we wanted at a good price.  the next day, he came in on his day off to go thru everything once agian when we picked up our first Honda ever!  Jim went way above what was necessary or offered by other dealerships.  Thank you.",4.6
122,"January 02, 2012","I enjoyed my experience with cleo bay honda as always since (Brent) was their miss him! But overall the sales man Daniel Rodriguez is the best and I would'nt want to look at another dealer or sales person if I have to purchase another auto as long as I have a residents here in texas. Daniel was very patient and honestly working to make us comfortable even if it took half the day he went out his way to get the results we wanted. My family and I was happy to spend the day with him and he was so helpful more than he knows. I Thank him for his generosity and making us comfortable to be able to have a great SUV and be able to afford it! Keep it up and you will be manager cause you deserve it!! Have a Happy New Year!!

But most of all Mr. Danny Rodriquez my sales rep, knows exactly what I like, need, and want in a car. Danny always proffesional, makes every transaction smooth and really cares about his customers.

124,"November 11, 2011","Elaine Mirabel and Sheila Brown helped me purchase a pre-owned Yukon yesterday.  I emailed a few days before going to the store, and Elaine was willing to work up some numbers even before seeing my trade-in.  Of course the number was low, but the fact they did that work at all made earned some points. When I got the store, I did have to wait for 10-15 minutes before I could talk with either Sheila or Elaine, but when Elaine got to me, she was dedicated to me.  She was very easy to work with and we struck a fair deal pretty quickly. The financing they were able to extend was very good.  Leroy the finance guy was easy going, efficient, and fairly low pressure on the extended warranty. He had me signed and out very quickly.  This was one of the smoothest and low stress car buying experiences I've had.  

The final test will be how the truck's missing Nav DVD will be handled. Elaine said the parts guy would get it overnighted and then they would overnight it to me.  I checked with Elaine and Sheila a few times to make sure it would be overnighted, not mailed or ground shipped.  My scores will go up if I get the DVD by next Tues - that will be full service. 

There was a negative thing that stood out.  The sales people not helping me were not very friendly.  They never really looked at me or smiled.  a few walked past me several times.  A few of them wandered around texting or talking with a co-workers, seemingly oblivious to the fact a customer was right there.  Odd. To sum it all up, though, it was a positive experience and I would definitely go back to Cleo Bay.

UPDATE 11/15/11:
The Nav DVD mentioned above came today, as promised. Elaine did a nice job of informing me of the shipping status. I am very pleased with the way this was handled. My Cleo Bay experience was definitely positive!",4.4
125,"October 07, 2011","ok this makes no sense i supposedly ""won"" a sweepstakes from these guys when im in debt that i qualify for a 20k loan.... think about that this company is so strapped for cash its going for people who would regularly be naive enough and not make a comment about it eventhough they are doing nothing but plunging YOU further into debt im a verteran myself so i see the damage that could do to a E1 for the rest of their life. get a better marketing strategy, really guys, thanks for reminding me im broke, yet not easily taken advantage of, at the moment and thank you for reassuring me this is all BS because my buddy got the same letter he ""won"" the sweepstakes as well and guess what all 4 other winners are the ..except me and him XD god you guys really dont care about your customers at all do you? This yet again shows that car dealers are so slimy and greedy they would put our nation's heroes in debt to make a profit, great marketing startgy in a military town, idiots.",1.7
126,"July 20, 2011","Ken is dismissive and condescending when there is an issue. We have bought several cars from the dealership before, and the service was much better in the past.  It is disappointing that in today's marketplace that consumers are treated in this manner.

Our vehicle is 3 months old, bought new at Cleo Bay.",2.6
127,"April 09, 2011","Our family went by looking for a late model used Honda and we pretty much knew what we wanted. We had already done some research and had actually viewed some of their vehicles on-line. The sales associate was very nice at first and covered all the usual bases of showing us the vehicle and arranging a test drive. After the test drive back at the office when it came time for actual pricing of the vehicle there seemed to be great difficulty actually coming up with a price of the vehicle for some reason. All the salesman kept talking about was how well we would be treated at the dealership and not to really worry about the number he gave us because it wasn't the ""real number"". Things continued along and it became late and my very pregnant wife began to get tired and we decided that it would be better if we came bcak the next day. We advised the associate that I would not be able to accompany my wife due to my work schedule but she would be in to discuss things further. That evening I gathered some information on the vehicle we were looking at and even got some on-line prices from other dealers in the region for my wife to compare whenever we finally got a figure from Cleo Bay. She went in the next day along with one of her friends and discussed pricing with the salesman and asked for a bottom dollar figure from them so we could get an honest comparison between dealers. At that point the salesman blew his lid and started yelling about how nice he was to her and that he is ""the best car salesman in the USA and nobody is going to be as nice to her as he is"". Who yells at pregnant women?! When did it become unacceptable to ask a car salesman for the ""best price"" or ask them if they can match a deal advertised by another dealer? This dealer wouldn't even meet their own price listed on-line because it's the ""internet price"" and doesn't apply if you come into the dealership! Needless to say all this guy was interested in was charging his price that was $1,100 more than what they had advertised on their own website and giving us $2,500 less than the blue book value on our trade. When my wife and her friend got up to leave the salesman followed them out into the lot and continued to yell about how they will never get treated as well at another dealer and get the kinda deal that he was gonna give us, he would just sell the car to someone else with no problem at all. I would never ever suggest anyone go to Cleo Bay now if that is the way they treat people and consider this ""being nice"". Do your self a favor and go buy your vehicle somewhere else. ",1.5
128,"April 05, 2011","What a great purchase experience!  I saw on-line that Cleo Bay had a great selection of cars I was interested in, and so contacted them via email.  Elaine Cloud responded and answered all my questions including detailed price inquiries over a two day period and completely answered all questions and emails.  When I arrived for a test drive, everything was very efficient and at no time was I pushed in any way to upgrade to a more expensive car or to take extras and packages (which had been a real annoyance at other dealerships!)  From start to finish, this was our best car buying experience ever and we will be back when we need another car.",5.0
129,"September 02, 2010","The ""new"" car which available for purchase has almost 200 miles on it. We tried to ask for compensation but instead the manager tricked us into doing financing with Honda to get the compensation. They claim they have ""refer a friend"" bonus; brought a friend there and he purchased a car but we never get the bonus. Please stay away!",2.2
130,"August 13, 2009","I had done some internet research, and had some idea of what I wanted to look at.  The salesman listened well, showed me a few cars, and once we had narrowed it down, let me test drive the one I wanted to test drive.  Carfax reports were available for most, if not all, of the cars.  He was able to answer all of my questions well and fairly (even when the answer didn't fall in favor of the car I was driving), and was very kind and friendly.  He wasn't pushy at all, which was really nice.  After the test drive, he could tell I wasn't ready to buy, so he didn't push then either.  He was very appropriate and kind as I left, as well, saying of course that he'd be happy to help me if at some point I was ready to buy a Honda, but not begrudging me the time he spent to help me at all.  I wanted to look some more, and as it turned out, that wasn't the right car for me.  But that wasn't the salesman or the dealership's fault at all.  If I wanted to buy a Honda, I'd go back there in a heartbeat.",5.0
131,"November 25, 2008","After doing my research on a Honda Odyssey 2008, I submitted my information including trade-in on several websites. Cleo Bay Honda replied with an offer that was somewhat better than all the others and they had the model I wanted. At first I was reluctant to drive the 60 miles to get there but Elaine assured me over the phone that they would stick to their end of the deal. So, I went there and it was the best car buying experience I've ever had. There were some minor negotiations regarding the trade-in value but it was all fair and they came within $200 of their ""sight unseen"" offer. I asked not to be bothered with extended warranties and so the subject never came up [that's a first!]. In my opinion, this is the way car buying should be. The friendliness, professionalism, service and efficiency of Cleo Bay Honda exceeded my expectations.",5.0
132,"January 04, 2007","Looked at a car my wife wanted, their prices were way off in my opinion (but you know women- if they want it price doesnt matter). Got to talking about financing and a trade on our car, so they took me outside to look over our trade in. When I came back the salesmen had already signed my wife to lease telling her thats what I wanted!!! NOOO!! Leases are traps!! I got the paperwork and looked it over, didnt seem like a bad deal the way THEY explained it, but after the deal I got home and re-figured the numbers. I was paying $300/mo for 4 yrs and had to give the car back??!! Financing thru my bank was $340/mo 60/mos and OWN it...Anyway,they are slick enough to ""devide and conquer"".so dont let them push you around. Ends up I went back and voided the whole deal and bought the car outright. 
whole thing in a nutshell: go elsewhere first, unless you like pushy slick salesmen..",3.0
