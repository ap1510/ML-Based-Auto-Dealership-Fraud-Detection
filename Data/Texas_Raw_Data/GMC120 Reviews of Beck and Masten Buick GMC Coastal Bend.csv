10,"April 01, 2019","Great people to deal with, honest and fair. 
I am 7 hours away and bought the vehicle based on their pictures and description, it was just as described, if not a little better than described.
They also agreed to meet half way to swap vehicles and finalize the paperwork, that is the kind of service that is hard to find these days. 
Jordan also took the time to show features on the car and pair up our phones,we were not rushed at all.
I would have given an extra star but communications were a little slow on the first day. 
I highly recommend them and i will keep them in mind for future purchases.

33,"February 12, 2019",Vibration issue in drivetrain. Took it there to diagnose. Made me take it to discount tire to rebalance the tires 2 times. Than they made me have discount change the tires to a new set. Luckily for me discount tire manager was courteous and understanding even though they knew it wasn’t their tires causing the issue. Finally they were able to track it down to the transmission converter. Waste of my time having to rebalance tires that were not the issue. Service advisors never once called me to update me on status. Always had to call them everyday to get a status. Ridiculous customer service and I will never take my vehicle back their again. ,1.0

35,"January 31, 2019","Being 2000 miles from home (Ontario, Canada), this Texas dealership's service centre went above and beyond to help us out by getting in the required parts and fixing the problems in our Silverado the same day. They shuttled us to & from their location to a local venue and kept us updated on the progress. This is why we buy GM and why we feel confident about being able to travel North America knowing this dealer network exists.

47,"January 01, 2019","I saw a new 2018 GMC Denali on B&M's website and made a cash offer in addition to trading in my 2014 GMC Sierra which I provided the VIN. I received a call from the salesman and he said he thought we could make good on my offer. I set up a date and had to postpone it to the next day due unexpected company. I texted the salesman and ask him not to waste my time if there was any doubt about the deal. He stated that he saw no reason the deal would fail unless I had a fender falling off my trade or something like that. I must add the deal was a drive out deal. I made the 2 hour drive to the dealership expecting to walk in and seal the deal but had to hassle for an hour to finally reach my offer only to find out this wasn't  a drive out price. I said just give me the keys to my truck ( trade in) and I'll be on my way.  Well the hassling continued, I drove the truck again and they finally made an offer $1,000.00 over my initial offer which I accepted. I should have walked out as soon as I got there because I had asked the salesman twice before I got there not to waste my time if they couldn't do the deal I offered.. The salesman was a nice young man but what he did was totally unethical. I like the truck I bought but do wish I had just walked out when the hassling of the price ( which was supposed to have already been settled ) started.  ",3.0
48,"January 01, 2019","I am very happy with the service i received at Beck and Masten. Courteous and professional, these folks made me glad i purchased my vehicle there. In the future, i will definitely purchase another vehicle there. ",5.0
49,"January 01, 2019","Usually the service department is wonderful, but in the last year it has gone down hill when it comes to the technicians doing the work on the vehicles. This visit specifically, the oil was changed on our truck and oil was left spilled all underneath the truck. The truck has a lift and you could see “black” all underneath where the technician let the oil run everywhere and didn’t care to clean up his/her mess. Another issue is that the fuel filter was replaced but the sensor was not re-set so we had to make an extra trip back to the dealership to have that taken care of, hopefully the part was replaced and we really got what we’d paid for. Mike was wonderful and always has been. It just seems bad when this isn’t the first time the technicians haven’t done their job very well. ",3.6

I had an appointment with Michelle but left it with mike since she wasn’t there. I’m disappointed in the service I received and still haven’t been able to change my oil since that was my only opportunity due to having to work many hours a day. Very disappointed. ,1.4

112,"October 11, 2018","After making my second appointment to have the known torque converter shudder on my 2016 Yukon Denali addressed they did not want to work on it due to having a dealer installed supercharger. I understand how other areas of my warranty could be null, however this is a known and common issue with the 8L90 transmission and has nothing to do with the modifications to the vehicle. They have even done all the oil changes and every tech and service writer knows this vehicle as it stands out quite a bit. Just disappointing that a known issue could not be addressed and GM is making the parts equally hard to get. I went to another GM dealer, purchase all the parts, fluids required at a cost of $350 and had another shop do the service required at a cost of $521. Mainly just disappointing, that an $75k vehicle can have such issues and be denied on a technicality but it is what it is. ",1.0
