Great  service,  VERY  nice,  and  seemed  to  be  honest  and  caring.  Only  problem  for  me  is  I  will  NOT  buy  another  Ford.  My  2017  Fusion  is  the  2nd  Ford  I  have  owned  that  anti freeze  got  in  the  engine  block  and  I  had  a  Focus  that  they  could  NEVER  fix  the  transmission  problem  it  had  that  almost  caused  my  wife  to  have  several  wrecks  due  to  it  slipping.  Plus  I  said  I  would  always  buy  American,  but  because  of  a  couple  of  foreign  auto  makers  that  have  much  longer  Warranties  and  prices  the  same  or  less  for  similar  vehicles  I  guess  I  may  have  to.  But  this  dealer  is  Excellent,  just  that  Ford  has  gone  down  hill.  Roger  Crowder  in  Burnet, Tx.   Have  a  Blessed  day  and  everyone  stay  safe  during  this  corona  outbreak",4.0

2,"January 10, 2019","This service department is EXCELLENT!  I always find the entire department courteous, professional and highly skilled.  But this service department has gone beyond this description - they also are honest and trustworthy.  I have a 2013 Lincoln MKS with nearly 138,000 miles on it.  My check-engine light has been on intermittently for a few weeks, so I made an appointment with the Johnson Sewell Service Dept. The technician quickly identified the problem, and both Rob Cormier and Gene Baker, managers, gave me an honest and fair estimate of repair.  They offered to help me with the considerable cost through their customer satisfaction program.  Much appreciated, as I'm on a fixed income and really can't afford a new car at the moment.  Thank you, JS Service Dept.. - you are the best!!!!!!",5.0
3,"November 12, 2018","Brandon Garcia was nothing but amazing!  He answered all my questions,  ALWAYS returned my calls,  and made my purchase a breeze.  I would highly recommend him and the dealership!  The finance dept was quick and had paperwork ready for me to sign, so there was no waiting!",5.0
4,"May 24, 2018","Kyle and Brandon were amazing at helping me with my car purchase.  I set them up with expectations that I wanted to get in and get out as quickly as possible, and they exceeded those expectations. I was surprised when I was driving my new vehicle, and I saw I had been there less than an hour.  Every time I had a question that I thought they would have a tough time answering, they were very forthcoming and didn’t make me feel like they were trying to get one on me. Zero hassle in pricing and trade value and I left the dealership knowing I got an amazing deal.  The short amount of time I did have to wait, the waiting area was nice and comfortable. I am over the moon with my experience with the sales department and couldn’t be more excited that I made the trip from Austin to see these guys ",5.0
5,"February 17, 2018",Appointment at 7 am.  Told them exactly what was wrong. Still charged diagnostic fee.  Took 7 hours to rotate and balance tires and tell me what was wrong with truck. Which was exactly what I told them. Second issue was a noise which they supposedly fixed 2 months ago and charged me 490 dollars for. Same noise but now they said it was from a different place. Other than oil changes I recommend going elsewhere. ,1.6
6,"December 29, 2017",I called about a Toyota Avalon that they had on the internet and talked to John Jernigan. He was very helpful and he was able to give me a great value on my trade in over the phone. We live 250 miles away and I was very appreciative of the way the do business. They were very up front about everything and even beat the finance rate that my credit union was giving me. They stayed after closing hours to complete the deal for us. It was a great experience and I will recommend them to anyone. ,5.0
7,"July 19, 2016",I was very impressed with the service I was given by Christine.  She was very knowledgable of the vehicle and answered all my questions.  I would recommend her to anyone looking for a Ford vehicle.,5.0
8,"April 19, 2015","Wow..How could I be any happier. Found the truck of my dreams. Called and got Mark, he was very friendly. My family and I drove 5 hours to get the truck, and it was everything and more that Mark had descibed. The No haggle price thing seems to be taking all dealerships by storm. This really simplifies the whole process. You find what you want, the price is what it is,,,compare... You call and make the deal. They were very polite and did work with us on the extended warranty. I must say they were very busy when we arrived, but this is what you get from dealerships that know how to sell. They even entertained my kids while we waited. Also they had the truck at the front ready to test drive. I am very grateful that they stayed open cause I arrived at closing. I left 3 hours after they closed. So if they know that you're coming, they will wait. Very classy group of people are at this location. I was impressed with how the dealership waited on you just like every other customer. Also very good trade in value on your vehicle.",5.0
9,"May 27, 2014","I am a Ford girl and have been for years, but I've always had to shop around and buy each vehicle from a different dealership.  But now I know where I will always be buying them from now on... and here's why:

My husband had previously worked with Tony Pippinger (who supervises things in the used car dept.) and called him to inquire about an explorer I had seen online that I liked.  I had already visited another dealership, gotten my trade appraised, and done my research online, so I walked in there to meet with Tony with lots of good informational ammo and was prepared to use it if I needed to.:)  But it was immediately clear that they weren't the kind of dealership that liked to play games and gave me straight numbers and answers to everything. Tony had me working with a very sweet sales guy named Steve who got me the last few answers I needed on the explorer and took great care of me throughout the entire process. I got a great deal on my 2013 explorer and was offered a more than fair amount for my trade.  Once we had all our details hashed out (took no time at all) I also had a great experience with the financing department. Bethany was wonderful to work with and sweet as could be - no weird crazy warranty pressure or last second tricks up her sleeve.  And then at the very end, when Steve was getting my vehicle detailed and gassed up for me, he even sent it through service because he felt like the one of the tires was a little low. They found a nail that had gotten in there and patched it immediately.  I literally went around and hugged everybody at the end, I was so happy with my experience.  Then I drove off the lot with a car I love for a price I love, all having bought it from people I loved working with.",5.0
10,"May 27, 2014","I am a firm believer in the fact that you should try and buy local, if possible.  I had really wanted another Hyundai Santa Fe but after looking at the Escape that was here at my local dealer I decided on it.  
The price was competitive, my trade-in value was good and it keeps me from having to travel to a dealer/service department in San Antonio or Austin.  My boss is a great fan of the Johnson Sewell service department!!
I have not had the car long but am very satisfied so far.  I do have great confidence that if I experience any problems it will be resolved quickly.
Ford is one of the only companies that bailed itself out of the financial hole it was in and did not rely on the government.
I did shop the internet first and I am still getting emails about buying a new car even after I have specifically told them I had already purchased a vehicle.  Very frustrating, plus it means they don't read their incoming emails and comments.

it is a proven fact that you always hear from the ""squeaking wheel"", people like to openly try and express their dissatisfaction and normally do not think or bother to express their good experience or satisfactions.

11,"October 12, 2013","I bought a 2008 Dodge Nitro from Johnson Sewell back in March. During the test drive I noticed the brakes were squealing, I mentioned this to the salesman who said, ""Oh, it's nothing. It's just the way the brakes are made these days."" I was still uncomfortable with that, but after talking to a couple other dealerships who said the same thing I sort of was at ease with it. Here it is, just over six months later and my AC has gone out in my vehicle. I checked the pressure of the refrigerant and there was next to none. I replaced the refrigerant in my vehicle and all was fine until not even four days later it was depleted again. I took the vehicle in to the dealership since I bought it there and have the warranty through them. They are now telling me that there is no leak they could find, so I am having to pay out of pocket for all repairs and my rental since my warranty isn't going to cover an ""evac and recharge."" All in all, they are just lazy. They do not want to do the work to find the issue and fix it. I have the Ford warranty since I bought the vehicle there and have had so many issues with just trying to get it looked at! All Ford dealerships keep telling me I need to take it to Dodge. Dodge will not cover my FORD warranty. I am so sick of the runaround. Do not ever buy from this dealership. They are just AWFUL. The girl in the financing department barely knew what she was doing and said she had been working there for years. I spent 8 hours there during the process of test driving and financing the vehicle. I regret ever going with this dealership. I highly recommend you do not buy a vehicle here, especially if you buy the warranty and will need repairs. They are lazy and will do whatever it takes to make a sale and then drop you. I am very disgusted with how they are treating me. I haven't had my vehicle but six months and am already having repairs done to it.",1.0
12,"November 15, 2011","After calling to verify that a particular F150 was in stock I drove down there(about 200 mi round trip and wasted about 7-8 hours) I found out that the vehicle apparently did not exist despite it's listing on the internet. Coincidentally, I was given a $15,000 trade in quote over the phone, sight unseen. That is ""bait and switch in its worst form.I am a proud Ford retiree and a proud loyal ford owner of app. 45 years. In my opinion, that dealership does not deserve to be associated with the name FORD. Needless to say, I was and still am, extremely upset when I finally saw through games they were playing and will do all in my power to direct potential customers to a more reputable dealer when possible.
