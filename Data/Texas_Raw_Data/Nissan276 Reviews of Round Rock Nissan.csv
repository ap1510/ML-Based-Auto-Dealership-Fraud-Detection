1,"August 08, 2019","My wife and I recently purchased a CPO - 2018 Pathfinder Platinum from Ricardo Cervantes on June 18th of this year.  The vehicle is nice, was clean and in overall great shape.  Once the smell added to cover the overwhelming smoke odor wore off the vehicle became unbearable.  I had given the dealership an opportunity to correct this on Thursday June 27th.  The vehicle was delivered back to me with a strong bleach odor that covered the smoke but that soon wore off too.  I have paid to have the interior detailed and the leather scrubbed and conditioned along with a thorough carpet cleaning.  Again, this helped but not for long.  I have used 8 scent ""bombs"" over the past month along with sprays for the AC system and more odor products for the carpet, leather, vents etc.. The vehicle is just not driveable because of the smell.  I have made my first payment just disgusted at the stench and this beautiful new car that I have to live with that causes everyone's clothes to stink when they ride with me.",2.8

5,"August 27, 2018","my car has 24k miles. the turn signal died. they want to charge me 250 to replace it because there design is so stupid they have to take the front end completely off.

6,"July 31, 2018","I recently tore up my car when I hit a pothole.  I broke my rim and damaged my front end suspension.  As always though, the guys at Round Rock Nissan got my car all fixed up in no time!  Jarrod Dozier was my main point of contact and I can’t say enough about how much I appreciated his commitment to me and my car.  I spoke with him on a daily basis and he kept me in the loop at every turn.  Luckily, everything worked out for me, but Jarrod had assured me that there were other options if I needed more time and by doing that, he helped to put my mind at ease.  I didn’t want to file a claim with my insurance because I didn’t want my rates to go up, so he understood that and really worked with me.  I am pretty sure I probably drove him crazy with my daily texts, but you never would’ve known because he was ALWAYS the nicest guy when we spoke, and very professional.  It was very apparent that he knew what he was talking about and I really appreciated that.  I knew that my car was in good hands with Jarrod.  Once he got me the quote for the repairs and I gave him the go ahead, I was amazed at how quickly the car was done!  I have had nothing but wonderful experiences with the Round Rock Nissan service department.  I have my necessary maintenance done here also (oil changes, inspections, tire repair, etc) and I have always been treated like I am the most important customer they have, which I assume is how they treat everyone, and in my opinion, customer service can’t get much better that that!!!  Round Rock Nissan is top notch in every aspect and Jarrod Dozier and the rest of the service department is who I will continue to entrust my Nissan with and everyone else should too!!!",4.6
7,"June 13, 2018",Jarrod D. and the techs in service are getting it done for their customers: quickly and professionally. I have had an A1 experience with him and all the staff here and would tell my best friend to get service done here.,5.0
8,"June 13, 2018","I bought my 3rd vehicle, a 2016 Titan XD Pro4x Cummins Diesel, from Round Rock Nissan on 7/31/2016. We have had many issues with it.From day one the heated seats have never worked.We have had issues with exhaust fumes in the cab even when the air conditioner is on recirculate,the engine will randomly surge while at a stop, the transmission does a double shift or bucks.The brakes feel soft.The DEF system using lots of DEF fluid.We have had the truck serviced at Round Rock Nissan at least 8 times since purchase for these various issues.Each time they have said they either fixed the problem or couldn't reproduce the issue.January 2017 we took the truck in for an oil change after going to CO.When our truck was returned to us there was wet dripping mud all down the right side, our spare jug of fuel had broken loose from the strap in the front left corner of the bed, up ended and cracked and spilling in the far back right corner as if someone had taken our truck off roading.We had to open a case with Nissan Consumer Services to finally get them to work on the heated seats.That time the truck spent over 45 days in the shop as they tried to replace all of the heating elements.They didn't follow the completion testing as outlined by the specialist tech.Instead they told Nissan Consumer Services that the vehicle was repaired and to close the case.When we arrived, not only did the heated seats not work, but they had also done damage to my vehicle.There were paint scratches, a cracked windshield, and damaged interior panels.There were also several greasy hand prints and the whole truck smelled like an oil lube shop.Because their tech was not able to follow a simple set of diagnostic steps the truck then had to be driven to a different dealership over 90 miles one way from my house.RR Nissan is 47 miles from my house.The other dealership was able to identify the problem, but couldn't fix it either.After spending 18 months trying to fix the vehicle we decided we had had enough and wanted to try to trade it in on a newer model that hopefully would not have these problems.The salesman and sales manager we had worked with at RR Nissan said to bring it in, they would make us a deal on a trade, wanted to make it right.Their idea of make it right was to sell us a vehicle we didn't want, that the heated seats also did not work in or a vehicle that did not have heated seats at all, lower the trade appraisal value based on damages they had done and proposed that we eat over $10,000 in negative equity on a vehicle that has had defects since day one.So we decided to check the vehicle back into their service department as a last ditch effort.We opened several more cases with Nissan CS since we hadn't reached resolution on any of them previously.They had my truck again for 3 weeks.On May 31st we were called by the service manager and told that our vehicle was ready.He said that the entire DEF system had been replaced, all previous damage had been repaired,and that all the other issues had been fixed by programming updates.My husband told the SM that we were on our way to get the truck.When we got there we learned that the SM had taken off for 3 days.When we got the truck there was still damage caused by previous visits,but now there was new damage. We had our service writer document the remaining and new damage. We put about 200 miles on the truck that day.The engine surging is still there, the brakes are still really squashy,the exhaust coming into the cab is worse than before and the transmission is still bucking and double shifting.Now the turbo gauge is jumping around and does not seem to operate normally,and our fuel economy has dropped down from an average of 17-19 MPG to 7-9 MPG. We called the dealership to open a new RO and document all of the issues the truck was still presenting so that it was already in the system when we went to drop it off next.We were called back by the dealer and told that since they can't seem to work on my truck without causing damage that they would like us to stop bringing our truck to them for service.",1.6
9,"May 31, 2018","Jarrod Dozier was my service advisor and he was awesome hands down! I came in on my birthday and found out my vehicle needed a coolant kit because my transmission has been running out and my car wouldn't allow me to go passed 80mph, so call my extended warranty and they wouldn't cover the cost for new part, I was in tears but Jarrod advised me other options and gave me hope!!! I thought my birthday was ruin but Jarrod made my day better! He has great customer service and very helpful!! I definitely will be returning back for services for my vehicle in near future!!!!",4.8

11,"May 17, 2018","On More than one occasion i have experienced and witnessed mis-use of customer vehicles. technicians pealing out backwards and then forwards from the oil change bays. I have tried to tell the techs that this is dangerous and that they need to stop. 

On one occasion taking my Titan into the service department after a winter road trip my vehicle was returned to me with Mud all down the passenger side of the truck. Additionally in the bed of the truck my spare fuel jug had been upended and the strap that was holding it still busted loose. the jug was at the opposite end of the truck bed and leaking fuel out of a fracture in the jug all over the bed of the truck. 

I reported this to the service advisor , who did nothing. i called several times to try and get the managers attention who finally offered to re-imburse me the lost fuel but said they had received no confession of the abuse to the vehicle. 

On a separate trip to the dealer for interior service the tech Craig returned my new leather interior truck back to me full of engine grease hand prints on the seats, steering wheel, door panels. a windshield crack,  and scratched in a dozen places both interior and exterior. one of the exterior marks looked as though my vehicle was sideswiped in their tech area. the service advisor acknowledged that the damages obviously occurred at the dealership and that they are responsible.
but did not offer to have the oil prints cleaned or the car detailed. I tried to get the repairs transferred to another dealer and all that was approved was a tool tray - i kidd you not. 

I have reported these items to the service manager, sales managers , the General manager, and Nissan Consumer affairs. None of which seem to have any interest in trying to resolve the issues they have with their service department.

12,"May 07, 2018","Horrible and dishonest people all over. We went on Saturday 5/5/18 to trade our 2014 pathfinder for a 2018 pathfinder. After many hours of negotiations we reach s deal on Saturday close to 7:00pm, like at 8pm on Saturday 5/5/18 they ask us to come back and finish the deal on Monday 5/7/18 because THEY have mess-up a vin umber in their system and they had to fix it but it was too late to do it on Saturday, to come back Monday and be done in a couple of minutes. For our surprise I called on Monday to remind them to detail the new unit, and put gas on it, to my surprise they told me that they could not make the deal because the number they mess in their system related to our 2014 trade-in. They did a physical valuation of or 2014 and offer us $14,500 on Saturday, now they tell me on Monday that they can only give me $13K for my 2014!!!!!  When they appraise our 2014 they did it with the vehicle present, they did their whole evaluation and came back with the 14,500, as we all understand, is not me telling them how much is my car worth, this is an offer that they do. Today Monday they back-off the deal, but to our surprise they even run our credit, so now I have a hard inquire  on our credit, and no vehicle. We did sigh an agreement on Saturday, the dealer document had all the numbers and it was signed by the manager and me, my wife, and my oldest daughter were witness to our agreement. When you have a deal you have a deal, not only morally, but legally they are obligated to move forward with the signed and agreed deal.

13,"April 30, 2018","Hello, I just wanted to let you know that my wife took her vehicle to Maxwell Nissan off of I-35, where she bought it, for an oil change. She came home with a bill for $231 because they told her that it needed an air cleaner, a cabin air filter and the brake fluid needed to be flushed. I checked the owner's manual it did say that the cabin air filter and the engine air filter should be checked at 30000 miles (this vehicle has less than 30000 miles) however the brake fluid is only recommended to be flushed at 30000 miles for extreme Duty vehicles. Her's is all highway driving. When I called the service manager to complain he said he would call me back after talking to the service writer.  After two days I called him back and left a voicemail.  Only then did he did he call me back to say everything was in line and they would not do anything to compensate us. He said that to have her call me would be sexist so yeah he went there, nothing prior to this was discussed about her calling me. However I do feel that they took advantage of a person that does not know vehicle maintenance nor wear and tear on vehicle parts. That's my story, you make up your own mind, we won't be going back.",1.0
14,"April 04, 2018",I dropped in to get the state inspection done on vehicle.  They were very prompt and even WASHED my car!!!!!  They presented the upcoming items that I needed to have addressed with my car one being an oil change.  I mentioned that I didn't think they could do the oil change since it is a Nissan dealership and I own a VW.  They NO problem we will get you taken care of.  That is Fantastic!

24,"January 06, 2018","We purchased a new car and were totally pleased with our buying experience.  There was no pressure to buy and no tricks to do add on sales like extended warranty etc.   Roman was very nice man.  Genuine and honest.  He gave us the time we needed to decide and never pressured us.  He pointed out the features of the different models to help us decide which one fit our needs the best.  Since the purchase, he has followed up to see if we needed anything.  ",5.0
25,"January 04, 2018","We enjoyed doing business at Round Rock Nissan. We found JJ to be very friendly and helpful. The dealership was efficient and we struck a deal on a car quickly. One the deal was made the car was detailed and ready for us to pick up almost immediately. The only thing we did not enjoy was in the finance office once the deal had been reached Clay, the Finance Manager, really pushed an extended warranty. We did not enjoy that part but every dealership does that and I do not think it reflected poorly on Round Rock Nissan, it's just part of the business. Overall I enjoyed the transaction and would do business with Round Rock Nissan again. I would also recommend this dealership.",4.2

28,"December 20, 2017","Purchased a new 2017 Frontier, found out at delivery(10 days later) that it had shards of broken glass all over the back seat.  While doing a walk around inspection I rubbed my hands over the rear bench seat and sliced my finger open on glass shards.  The sales manager did nothing but hand me a band-aid after I got cut by the glass.  Apparently, their 5-star preparation process does not involve actually looking at the vehicle.  After 3 separate visits to resolve the problem and a call to Nissan Consumer Affairs they kept the vehicle in service, for over 30 days, and gave it back with more damage.  Brandon Ming - GM says they won't replace it but will offer(bribe) a free service package for the inconvenience but won't replace or refund the vehicle and refuses to give an explanation as to why ""We don't have to"" was the exact response.  Noone will return your calls unless you get consumer affairs involved than they will stall and claim that they have to call someone else to get your answer just to get you off of the phone.  If you're looking to purchase new, go elsewhere.  This business does not follow their own policy's and will lie and stall repeatedly if you have a problem.

37,"November 24, 2017","DO NOT purchase a pre owned vehicle from this dealership.  We purchased a truck three months ago from Round Rock Nissan, and upon driving the vehicle off the lot the check engine light came on. We spoke with Thomas our salesman and learned that in effort to sell the truck to us that it had never been inspected before selling it. We were told that we would need to bring it back in so it can be fixed and the truck could be inspected and registered to us. We brought the vehicle in over the course of the next 3 months 2 more times and were told the issue was fixed, yet every time we picked it up the check engine light would come right back on. When we took the vehicle back the third time we learned that the dealership had actually somehow inspected our truck and registered it to us while the check engine light was still on. They handed us our new illegally obtained plates, and reluctantly gave us a loaner and said that our truck would be fixed. They had our vehicle for over a week when I received a very rude email from Scott Kingsbury that my truck was fixed and I needed to go pick it up. We picked it up the next day and were told by Ricky Walker that absolutely nothing was done to it because the check engine light was not on when we dropped it off. (Makes no sense, why would we drop a truck off with no check engine light) We have now taken the vehicle back to Round Rock Nissan for the fourth time today for the check engine light being on and they told my wife to come back Monday because there was nothing they can do today. TRANSLATION (Were not going to put you in a loaner that we can potentially sell this weekend) When I called the Gen. manager Scott Kingsbury his solution was that it wasn't going to get fixed today. I told him that we needed a solution or we would contact an attorney and report them for illegally inspecting the vehicle, and his response was to go ahead and contact an attorney and hung up on me. Round Rock Nissan will do everything to get you into a new vehicle, and then brush you off when you need assistance. ",1.0

56,"October 10, 2017"," Took my vehicle in for service because it was running rough. It's a 2011 Nissan Frontier with 86K miles on it and I've never had a problem with the powertrain. 
 The service department was able to quickly diagnose the problem and repair it within two hours.  The service also included some unrelated minor recall work. 
I was over 600 miles from home at the time so they really saved the day for me, and even ran my truck through the car wash when it was done!

64,"August 13, 2017","Wow . . . and not in a good way.  Utterly disappointed.  After the sale service is nonexistent.  Yesterday I finally received the cargo cover I paid for in September when I bought the car.  Needless to say many calls and texts to them since were ignored.  I had been out of commission for a couple of back surgeries for several months but finally went to the dealership in person a few weeks ago to speak with management.  The sales manager was pretty much unconcerned.  Although I had copies of my texts with  the salesperson--the few that had actually been responded to, which also included confirmation that he would provide a bumper protector as well to make up for the hassle, the manager did not look at them and simply refused to honor that agreement saying he had fired that person for this kind of thing.  (WHY would you tell a customer that?!)  The protector costs less than $100, so it really is the principle of the issue.  He did order the cargo cover that was on the original sales paperwork, but it was the wrong color so then had to be re-ordered.  Geez!  Jim in the parts department got it squared away and has been the only person who did what he said he would do and in a competent and timely manner. 
By the way, this was all on top of them assigning my original temporary tags for such a short period of time that I had to go back to get another and then finally go back for the permanent license plate that came in only a day before it is required.  This was very inconvenient to my home in Georgetown.
I love my Murano but needless to say I won't be a return customer at this dealership. There are too many other options and ones that will appreciate their customers and strive to provide stellar service.",1.0

81,"June 26, 2017","I brought my 2016 Nissan Quest in for an oil change and to check the fluids as it was running a little hot. After an hour the service manager (Lynn) called me and said they wanted to drain the antifreeze to look for an air bubble that would cause the problem. After waiting 7 hours I finally received a call to pick up my car and the problem was resolved. After checking out and paying my $200 bill and receiving a inspection report that everything on my car was functioning properly I went to start it and drove around the block and my AC did not work.  I then brought the car back and they said they were super sorry and would get it fixed asap and got me a rental car for the night. The next day Lynn called me and stated the part that needed replaced was not a factory part and it was not under warranty and the bill was $515.00 on top of the $200 I had already paid. I told her that would not work as they were the ones that broke the AC (there was never an issue before) She then called me back with the Dealership manager who said they would discount it to $450 and when I said that was crazy he said then I wont discount it at all. It was by far the worst I have ever been treated by any dealership in my life. After arguing with him for a good twenty minutes he said he would discount it to $275 just to make me go away. Keep in mind this was to replace two Oring that cost him $8.00 (he confirmed the cost) After all of this I just paid the $275 as we needed the van for a trip the next day and the van was still running hot. So I paid $475 for an oil change to be done to my van, nothing else was different from when I initially brought it in. They are absolute crooks here at the service department and their management is more worried about making money than treating the customer right. ",1.0

Jose Rivas was really helpful and found me a car that I absolutely love and made the process as easy as possible. He assured me that I can still trade in my car with the problems it had and found something that remained pretty close to what I was paying monthly. When I was feeling unsure, he reassured me that I'd be getting a better safer car for a reasonable price and made me feel more confident in my purchase, especially with this being my first time getting a car solely under my name. We talked on the phone the day before and he had everything set up for me by the time I came in. He even went out of his way to come in on his day off and work with me to ensure I got a better car than the one I was in. When it came to the paperwork, CJ was extremely helpful! He answered all the questions I could possibly have about financing and walked me through the whole process. I didn't walk away not knowing everything I could about my purchase and it really made me feel confident about it and what I was paying month to month.

99,"April 11, 2017",I hate going to car dealerships. Buying a new car is honestly my least favorite thing mostly because as a 23 year old I have no idea what I am doing. My fiancé helped me deal with the financial aspect because he has a better understanding of it works however every one of the employees we dealt with made sure that I compleatly understood everything. They could have easily ignored me and just talked to my fiancé since he knew what they were talking about. I'm so appreciative that they took the time to explain it all to me! The car selling business is heavilysaturated with sleazy salesmen and I never once felt like I was dealing with one there! It was great talking to honest people who didn't use cheesy sales tactics and boldfaced lies. Not only were they upstanding individuals and a pleasure to work with but the process was unbelievably fast! There wasn't a million counter offers and game playing and the car was ready very quickly!

I got the oil change, but they forgot to reset the ""oil and filter"" light, so every time I started my car, I had to see that warning.  I would have taken it back right away, but I was on a long driving trip.  The second time I took it in, I needed another oil change, and my remote start [from the key fob] would rarely work unless I was right next to the car.  I also reported a grinding noise, as well as the seat belt light that wouldn't go out even when the passenger seat was empty.  They could not duplicate any of these problems.  In fact, on the way back out to my car, I told the service agent to use the remote start.  He did.  When we got to the car, it had not started the car.  His jaw hit the ground.  I told him before I picked it up that their troubleshooting of the fob issue was not thorough, but he dismissed me with the battery was low.  Pffft.  I'll find another dealer to do my work for me.  Don't take any car you need to this dealership for repairs.

This certified gently pre-owned Nissan that Mom financed at a thrifty APR with an actual price that was priced to sell quickly for this sparkling charcoal cleverly designed 2014 Sentra with a low-mileage engine that is cleaner than Mr. Clean’s  kitchen sink with a top to ground interior and exterior that looked just as good and drove just as perfectly as a brand new model!. I was so glad she was able to snatch up this car before anyone else prudently bought it before we did! 

So, we were first referred by a reliable friend, to a very grand person in Mr. Jose Rivas, and then we secured a fantastic deal with amazing terms in a sensible monthly loan agreement that also includes bumper to bumper coverage that a private sale individual could not do. We are so pleased and definitely would give this dealership and their personnel a 5 star rating, but with no Oscar awarded to them, since these people were not phony actors, but instead were very sincere with integrity and a gracious sense of true kind spirit. But maybe the best part of it all was when mom approvingly patted me on the top of my bald head just prior to speedily driving off in her proudly purchased spectacular Nissan!

Luis went on to tell me how it was not their fault, and there was nothing wrong with the transmission or the way it was installed. I told him I was going to come get the car, and he started telling me I was going to owe them for the transmission fluid they put in. I told him I was not paying, and was going to call Nissan corporate if the tried to charge me when I got there to pick up the car.

Overall our experience was a great one and I would definitely recommend Round Rock Nissan to anyone who's looking to get into a new vehicle!
Thank you Shelly and Jay!

188,"November 26, 2015","Round Rock Nissan gets an A+++! From the beginning when we were connected with Ben Henderson, and when going through Finance with Khan, and when being presented with our 2 newly purchased vehicles at the end by Ben, it was truly the BEST car buying experience we have EVER had!  We can truly say without a doubt that Ben Henderson is truly the BEST at what he does as he is not just there is sell cars, he is there to help the customer...and to help do whatever he can to make sure that the customer is happy. That is exactly what Ben Henderson did! Ben went well above and beyond what we would say any car salesperson has ever done for us. Instead of just saying ""no"", he would say ""I will check"" or ""let me see what we can do"".  Ben and others there at Round Rock Nissan left no stone unturned. When coming to the dealership, we initially came to trade 2 vehicles for 1, but when we found that would not work out, Ben did whatever he could do and presented all the options to us that he could possibly offer. Ben was very understanding and could really relate to our situation, and we greatly appreciated his care and consideration.   Ends up, Ben worked with the fantastic finance team to get us into 2 Altima’s...and not just any Altima...the ones we ""really"" wanted, because we want these to be the cars that we will enjoy for a long long time! Ben was AMAZING! He was personable, patient, caring, had a continual pleasant, kind demeanor, and he truly ""worked"" to help make something work out for us that we were incredibly happy with! When we say he “worked”, he truly did! In fact, for 3 days, he did whatever was needed to make sure that this process went as smooth as possible and that we got into the vehicles that we wanted.  The time and effort that Ben invested is truly appreciated and will never be forgotten! We cannot say enough good about our experience at Round Rock Nissan, and even more, about Ben Henderson. He deserves high praise and recognition for his steadfastness and exceptional customer service skills and positive, hard-working attitude and demeanor that never waivered! Ever step of the way, Ben kept us informed through the process, never leaving us ""hanging"" and he gave us the true confidence that he would go the extra mile to help us and we would be well taken care of...and we were!  We will most definitely be coming back to Round Rock Nissan for further needs/business let alone, we are firm believers in giving referrals and we will definitely be referring anyone we know who needs a car, to RR Nissan!  We also want to recognize Tony and Khan for all of their outstanding assistance and their friendly, cordial, kind demeanor and all of their assistance to do whatever they could to help us! We are in the Customer Service business, and when we ""receive"" Exceptional Customer Service, it really stands out to us and it makes us come back and give our business again. We had a somewhat ""unusual"" request for a certain type of tires that we preferred on the vehicle. Ben and Tony went out on the lot and started looking at every single vehicle out there to see if they could find the tires we preferred! Never had we had someone go to these lengths to do this for us. This is another example of them going ""above and beyond the call of duty"" to do whatever the customer was requesting. We will never forget this as this just added to the exceptional impression and service we received.   A huge ""Thank you"" to everyone there who helped us, but again, to Ben Henderson who we would nominate him to be the ""Outstanding Salesman of the Year""!! Sincere gratitude to Ben Henderson and everyone at Round Rock Nissan! You have made us very happy Nissan customers! We will be back! So for anyhow else heading to Round Rock Nissan...just ask for Ben Henderson and you will be in the best of care!
With sincere appreciation,
Bryan and Patricia Blodgett

Worst excuse for a sales person and finance department I've ever heard of at a dealership. First, two hours later after test driving, appraising his vehicle and waiting for the guy to finish up with his customers that were already waiting on him, they were adamant they needed ME as a co-signer. Nope, so another hour later, magically he could now be approved on his own, ran the numbers and gave him options to choose from. Another hour later, they told him to clean out his car and that the vehicle for lease is being detailed and almost ready! Great. Another hour later, turns out he needed a co-signer after all. OKAY, another hour later, car cleaned out, he had the keys to the vehicle he wanted to lease, and oh, this vehicle is cash only now, sorry. CASH ONLY?! 5 hours later and it's not even available for lease!!! AFTER running my fiancee's and his co-signer's credit I might add, did they come back and say cash only. So of course no deal!! They ALSO raised the price of the vehicle that they told him the previous day it was for sale for so that AFTER his trade in, it then became that price. This place is a pathetic excuse for a professional dealership that's only trying to screw people and look out for themselves.

What a breath of fresh air! Our saleman, Charlie Cook, was low-pressure, friendly and most of all, knowledgeable. He listened intently at our needs and we bought the very first vehicle he showed us. They were in the midst of their Labor Day sale and we got such a great deal that we splurged on the extended warranty. The 2015 Pathfinder is amazing, loaded with options that would have cost thousands more if we had gone with the Pilot, Highlander, or similar.  One point here is that we are replacing an Escalade and nothing we saw came close in terms of options, power and comfort until we found the Pathfinder.  And we paid $40k less than a new Escalade.  Our finance manager, Aric, was fabulous in setting up the perfect plan for us, never pushy and extremely professional.  Another point is that Round Rock Nissan actually does have cars to sell, PLENTY of inventory.

207,"August 29, 2015","I scheduled a visit to look at the available vehicles and to see what I needed to do to buy a car before the end of the year.  Not only did I wind up buying a car that night, my husband got one too!  We dealt with Charlie Cook who listened to our plans and showed us how we could make them a reality and with no need to wait!  We will definitely be returning to deal with him when it is time for a new car.",5.0
208,"August 28, 2015","Jerry Crider at Round Rock Nissan put me in a new Xterra. He was such a great guy to work with. Very down to earth, absolutely no pressure, and a straight shooter. And he has some funny stories to tell. From the substantial test drive to the last signature on the dotted line, it was a fantastic experience overall. Also great experience with Q (Yes, just ""Q"" like Q from James Bond) in the finance department. I financed my car with an outside bank and was still treated exceptionally well. Q put absolutely no pressure, gave me suggestion based on hearing what my needs were and if I said 'no"" it was end of story. No hard sell which finance departments are infamous for. 

As a business owner myself and a sales person who doesn't believe in high pressure sales tactics, this is an honest to good place to come get your next ride. I'd have no hesitations sending anyone here including my mother - if she were in the market. She's not, but if she were... :)",5.0

210,"August 23, 2015",Ray Malkiewicz at Round Rock Nissan was awesome to work with.  He was very thorough in explaining the Altima and the Rogue and he new the features of both vehicles we looked at.  He really understood our needs and what we were looking for.  Throughout the process he explained everything and asked to make sure that we understood and there was absolutely no pressure.  This was definitely the most stress free car buying experience we ever had.  I would definitely go back when ready to purchase another vehicle.  Thank you so much Ray!!!,5.0
211,"August 20, 2015","I had the pleasure of working with Jeremy to purchase a new car.  My previous car was no longer working and I had to buy something relatively quickly.  I am a complete novice and also saving to buy a house, so budget & value were top priority for me.  The entire process was very straight-forward and Jeremy addressed and adhered to my priorities in the new purchase.  He answered all my questions effectively and in a straight-forward manner, never up-selling me unnecessarily (which was a major concern of mine.)  It was a wonderful experience.  He went the extra mile each step of the way to ensure I was informed and had everything I needed.  The financing portion of the deal was also efficient, and I felt my wishes were respected (not a lot of pressure for add-ons I declined to purchase). I highly recommend this dealership!",4.8

213,"August 13, 2015","We purchased our 2009 vehicle from Nissan Round Rock on June 30th, 2015.  Sales wise, at least we thought everything went smoothly and believed the vehicle was in safe condition after the salesperson reassured us that he wouldn't sell us anything in bad condition.  We found the used car we wanted, and we were told before we made the purchase, that they would do a thorough inspection because they wanted to give us a vehicle that was safe. Mind you our daughter was with us, so you would think they would take this commitment seriously. Apparently, we don't feel that they did, because as it turns out, after taking the car into their service department following experiencing a whining noise we could hear going past 60 mph and intermittently shaking of the car, as if it wanted to die on us. And experiencing the car stalling on my wife in the middle of the highway during traffic rush hour, which upon accelerating the gas pedal, the car wouldn't go. All the code lights turned on, and the brake locked up. It was a frightening experience with our daughter in the backseat!!! 

We were told the front rods are leaking and the bushings along with them in the front of the car have to be replaced, but they will not cover it because it is not a safety issue!!! Not to forget to mention,  that the transmission fluid was black and needed to be flushed, but  they went ahead and covered that because it is a safety issue. We were never told about this, which led to this past week and has left us very upset and disappointed. We plan to share our experience with our very large social network of parents and friends about what happened, to make sure we warn them that this can happen to them.  Nissan Round Rock does not take its commitment to safety as fully as we thought they would. 


We will get to a quote from their own report to us in a moment on that. It's a real head turner. So they  cover the transmission flush $350, which should have been done in the first place before selling us the vehicle. Then we were told an estimate of about $1,200 in the red, if we want them to fix the both front struts! Oh, and get this, they told my wife it wasn't leaking when they inspected the vehicle.  And it's considered a maintenance issue, not a safety issue while it continues to leak. Sooo, how did they miss the black transmission fluid if it is a safety issue I wonder???  

Here  is a statement from their own report!

 ""Worn out struts can lead to serious handling problems with your car, and this presents a safety issue""

Uhhhhh, but we were told its not a safety issue. Hmmmmmm.  Someone was not being honest, and it certainty was not us.  They of course, continued to refuse to pay for it, and we were not going to let them dig their hand into our pocket for something that should have been fixed due to their negligence, since Nissan is a family company, and safety always comes first, from what I am told. 

So we have our transmission flushed, but we are still with two front leaking struts, courtesy of Round Rock Nissan.  Too say we are deeply upset, especially after seeing their own report, is troubling. We have two Nissans! And as valued customers, it would be the right thing to do, if someone who has an understanding  heart, and a commitment to safety, would step forward and correct this problem and make sure it is taken care of.  It should have been found the first time, before allowing us to make the purchase and it wasn't!  

We are deeply disappointed in our experience, and are letting everyone know that this is not acceptable. We are twelve days away from our little one starting school, and this vehicle was intended to take her there and back. ",2.2
214,"August 13, 2015","We were in the Market for a 2 year old Jeep Grand Cherokee. I contacted this dealership online at 2am in the morning via chat to see if the car I was interested in was available.  The representative chatting with me was extra helpful (sent a transcript for my review, credit ap via email, confirmed the car was in stock, and forwarded my info to Internet sales). Scott Slonaker contacted me the next morning. He answered every question I had in a professional and timely manner. We came in at 5;30pm and left around 9:30pm with our Jeep. I did a ton of research before coming in to this dealership. My husband and I were very happy with the price, and their professionalism regarding the price and negotiating. Financing with Aric was excellent, and he was very fast, accurate, and personable. Overall, this was our best used car experience from start to finish. I am 50 years old, so I have experience with this process. I pick our license plates up tomorrow then back to school shopping at the Round Rock Outlets. Even the location is a big win!

215,"August 10, 2015","First you have to hear about my problem and then I will tell you how great Round Rock Nissan and Ben are! I hate to car shop, too many choices and questions.  And then there are the sales people that almost knock you over to sell you a car.  First we went to the Nissan dealership in Austin it was horrible!  The 'NEW 2015' car they pulled up had almost 300 miles on it and it was so dirty, it was nasty dirty and it made a really bad sound!  The sales person I meet with was very unsure of everything.  My husband told them UP FRONT we were pre-approved and want to use our bank to finance.  No problem!  I return with my husband to complete the paperwork and here comes the BS!  Oh no, you can ONLY get this price from us and if you finance through us, after we had already told them we didn't want to do that!!  This person/persons totally wasted our time, not to mention my husband took off (unpaid) to do this.  I was so so irritated.  
So a couple of days pass and we decide to give it another shot.  So this time my husband went to Round Rock Nissan and met Ben Henderson.  WOW!  What a difference!!  The floor sales personnel were friendly and not pushy!  My husband told Ben what he wanted and Ben found it!  My husband and daughter took it for a test drive and loved it!  Now it is my turn!  I returned with my daughter to drive the car and we went to drive it and it was gone (now, we DID NOT put a $$ hold on the car). I was sad!  But Ben found another one, YAY Ben!  So I drove it and decided this is what I wanted and it was clean and shinny!  I asked questions and got answers!  It needed a spot fixed and Ben said not a problem.  All good so far! (BTW the person next to us bought the other car! LOL)  Now, you still have to go to finance, hummmm?  And currently, there is an hour wait!  Bummer!!! So, I go pick up my husband and we return, we are next.  While we waited Ben checked on us and showed us where the bottled water was and such.  We are up, we meet Que!  I liked him too!  Here we do and the math, tax, title and ... Que showed us some packages and because I drive all day he suggested ONLY the right ones and not a bunch of stuff I didn't need.  RR Nissan closes at 8:00pm, we all (us Ben and Que) left after 9:00pm!  I was really thrilled that they did what was needed to make it work and we left with a car!!!  YAY us!  The customer service was great and we didn't feel like we got a lot of BS.  We felt like we were told the truth from the time we walked in to the late hours that we left.  Thank Ben Henderson for showing and selling us our car!  And thank you Que for also staying late!!!  Round Rock Nissan is a 'Good Thing'! ",5.0

My dealer, Jerry Crider, impressed me with not only the courteous and respectful way he handled my purchase, but also with his unmistakable commitment to integrity. Jerry's knowledge and experience helped me make a confident decision. And he's got a great sense of humor too. I felt totally comfortable throughout the process and Jerry was directly responsible for keeping me from going into meltdown mode during what could have been an extremely stressful experience for someone with a rocky credit history like me. Jerry Crider, you are my hero and the reason why I have an awesome new car that I am really proud of. Would I go back to Round Rock Nissan again? In a heartbeat.

I have to say Round Rock Nissan is not only interested in the numbers, but the person. Jerry was not just professional, but Madeline buying experience a very personal experience. I consider Jerry a friend and would refer others to him wheneve I can. He is honest, and was looking to help my daughter not just buy a car, but the ""right one"" for her, and for her pocketbook too. I can't say enough how we appreciate what Round Rock Nissan, and Jerry Crider has done for our family. I will be looking to buy our next family vehicle with Jerry sure.

Buying a car these days is stressful enough, and for my daughter to walk away in tears of joy meant the world to me. Jerry handled it in person, text, and phone calls, whatever it took to help her out.  So THANK YOU Jerry, and Roind Rock Nissan for helping a Dad with making his daughter smile. Way to go guys.

251,"September 05, 2014","Very disappointed. I held back at least a week before writing this review to give them a chance to make things right, turns out these managers are not so eager to fix things with their customers.

My husband and I wanted to add an automatic remote start and get our tires rotated on our pathfinder. I called a week ahead to schedule the services to get done, talked to the operator who schedule me for Friday at 10:30am, then she passed me to their service department to confirm prices for the labor etc. I spoke to a Nissan service employer, Lasandro which confirmed the labor price and the part price. My husband paid for our part to be ordered in which was to be received by Friday.

I arrive Friday at exactly 10:30am, with my 2yr old daughter. I check in counter in which I meet the service employer Lasandro. He reviews with me the services my husband and I requested and tells me to have a seat in the waiting room while he checks to make sure the part is received. I wait for about 2 minutes as he comes back to confirm everything is good to go and their getting started. GREAT...I thought. I asked him about how long things should take and he replied about an hour in a half or so. Not too long. GREAT...I thought again because let me remind you I had my 2yr old daughter with me in her stroller and I'm 7 months pregnant, just to give you a picture of what they were dealing with.

An hour and half goes by, then eventually two hours. I didn't want to be pushy or feel like I was rushing them to do their job, but I thought, hmm, I'd better check up on things to see how they're progressing. I walked up to Lasandro and asked if he could check up on the progress of my pathfinder. Sure, he replied and went to the back. He comes back with a piece of paper that has three apparent recalls our pathfinder needed. He tells me when they were scanning my vehicle, they found these recalls and could not let me leave without them proceeding to make sure these were all up to date. OK great, so how long will it take for these to get completed? In which he replied, it can be a little time consuming because they have to download the new data, but then we'll proceed to your tire rotation and programing of your remote key start. Then, I gasped and said so these recalls haven't been started! What have they been doing for the past two hours???? Then he backed tracked and said no, they have already started they're just finishing up...YEAH RIGHT, I thought...so then he offered me a shuttle ride back home, but upon speaking with him, by the time I get loaded on the shuttle and taken home, my pathfinder is going to be ready...I live in Pflugerville. I opted to stay and wait for the recalls to be finished then they can finally start on the two services we originally requested.

Another hour passes by, Lasandro comes up and asks do I have a key for my wheel locks? Um, I didn't even know what that meant as the blank look on my face took over, he proceeded to tell me that unfortunately, my wheels can not be rotated because they have after market wheel locks that NIssan does not carry the key for. Then as the disappointment arose in my face, he quickly said he'll look in the vehicle to make sure it wasn't already hidden someplace. I called my husband to confirm what they were asking for and it turns out we did not have the key. So there I am with my 2yr old toddler 3 hours later, just for them to tell me that our tire rotation can not be done....which anyone could have guessed that maybe that should have been the first simple thing to look at right off the bat and know well can't do the tire rotation....

Then, about 10minutes later he tells me they are just now starting to program the remote key start and it shouldn't be too long. One hour later, yes..one hour later, he comes back to tell me that their computer crashed right in the middle of the programming and they don't know how long it will take to get the system back up to fix and reprogram. At that point I lost it and told him just to wrap everything up and I'm really ready to leave. In which he said, unfortunately, since we deactivated your old key entry, the car will not start at all.

OKAY, Not only did I have to WAIT almost 5 hours for simple ""quick"" services to get done, but NO ONE checked on me, and the SERVICES were NOT DONE.  Later, after my husband was speaking to their service manager, Raj on duty, he said, ""oh yeah I was wondering why that woman and her child were still here,"" (mind you other employees noticed and said the same thing to my husband), I guess it never occurred to the ""Manager,"" to CHECK UP ON ME AND MY VEHICLE and see what was going on! My husband and I got to the bottom line, and we had asked to receive the part we ordered at NIssan cost and get a refund for the full amount we paid. No manager has called, so I guess this location and managers are pretty proud of their poor customer service reviews, pathetic.",1.4
252,"August 10, 2014","I wanted to get my nissan maxima service so I could drive it on my vacation, but the earliest appointment was Thursday and I left on Monday.  I rented a car and left the car on Monday.   I wamted the oil changed, rotation and balancing, check my brakes, get inspection done. on Tuesday Ireceived a call from the service agent advising there are several major issues with the car and I now needed to spend an additional $800.  I was in shock as I spent over $700 at this dealership in January for the same car.

Upon my return a week later to pick up the car we noticed the inspection was not done.   we checked the oil that also was not done nor was the stickers changed.  When I turned the car on the a/c was left on at 60 degrees. The service agent claimed that was not on the order, although he was the one who told me it would be 170 for my original service.  To top it off the charged an additional $50 for the shop why do I need to pay this fee when there labor charges were over 700.  with their mishap I was late turning in the renter car and had to pay an additional fee.   
Then I had to be inconvenienced amother day because they had to take the car to complete the  service.  once again my car was returned at 60 degrees.  I have  been taking my csr here over 7 years but their charges are ridiculous.  There is no way a part cost $8 and labor $170 just too high.  In one year I am paying 2000 for service and i only drive ten minutes to work home.   just absolutely ridiculous",1.6

Not because the people are unfriendly or the work they have done so far has been bad, but because I can never get in on short notice (appointments are out several days to a week) and getting a shuttle ride is next to impossible.

Then I was back again because guess what...it wasnt starting.  This time they found some more stuff they thought was wrong.  They also found it would be more expensive $630.  After some conversation we settled on $250.  Until I saw my credit card statement for $350.  I just let it be to avoid having to dealing with them again.  A few days after the second ""fix"" guess what?  Now it's overheating.  Back we go to the dealership.  This time $1025 in repairs.  I said forget it Ill go somewhere else.  They said okay but it'll be an additional $150 just to drive the car off the lot.  I said no.  So now my car sits on their lot and no one wants to call me back and explain how they have consistently been unable to properly diagnose and repair my car.  The incompetence of this place is beyond belief.  I should have listened to my dad when he said buy an American made vehicle.",1.0

The salesman offered to repair some minor damages like a crack in the windshield and the third day they finally told me they could not fix anything in the car.  They failed to honor all promises made the first day, just to make me go back.  The salesman was rude and had no customer service skills.  All he cared for was to sale the car.  Since they didn't want to share the inspection reports I asked them to lend me the car to take it to a mecahnic for an inspection, and they denied it. Everything went wrong.  I had the most horrible experience with this people.  I don't recommend this dealer to anyone. As afr as the 2008 Black Nissan Sentra - Sedan they have available, please don't buy it.

I only have some simple questions but have been told, ""We're shorthanded"", after 5 months, you're still shorthanded??? That's not a customer's problem, that's a dealership's problem. Worst customer service after the sale that I've seen. Won't be buying from them again, I should have looked at this website first.
I will say their service department is great. I had my oil changed at the 3750 mark and the service was quick and very cordial.",3.2

260,"May 08, 2011","I have bought several cars over the years...new and used.  This is by far the worst experience I have ever had.  Never have I experienced such deceptive practices and unprofessional service!
My horrifying experience started with a small issue involving a crack in the windshield they ""fixed"" with a resin injection prior to me purchasing the car.  I was not made aware of the existence of the crack, as it would have affected my decision to purchase this vehicle.  Within two days of purchasing the vehicle the crack reappeared, and I tried to approach them about repairing it.
Not only was I refused service of ANY kind, but found out that their ""30 day return policy"" that the salesman AND the finance manager told me about was a lie.  When I told them I would not accept this treatment, they threatened to void my warranty that I purchased with the vehicle.  They proceeded to taunt me, telling me that there was nobody I could call to resolve this and that I was ""screwed"" (their words).
This is the way they treat you less than a week after financing $16,000!
DO NOT GO TO THIS DEALERSHIP! IF YOU DO...DO NOT SIGN A THING WITHOUT A LAWYER PRESENT AND A MECHANIC LOOKING OVER THE VEHICLE FIRST!
I am currently pursuing them with legal action.",1.0

Purchased 2 cars here and watched how one of their salespeople lied and cheated to try and get in our the second deal. A general email to the dealership does not make someone my sales rep.

The location is terrible. Try going there around rush hour, it is brutal.

It is difficult to find parking at the dealership. If you do find a spot then you just may not be able to get out of the spot.

Dead ROACHES were all over the floor of the dealership. Really? You can't pick them up before your potential customers arrive? Those poor kids that crawl on the floor there. YIKES!

They don't call to tell you that your license plates are in. You have to call them. They want you to come down there to pick them up. We finally got ours and realized they had them for over a month.

Try finding a fully loaded car you like on their lot. Odds are that someone at the dealership used it for a ""DEMO."" All that means is that the car has several thousand miles on it and was used by the GM.

Lastly - Don't even get me started on their service department. It just plain stinks. PERIOD",1.4

My father however, bought the same car, and has been waiting fro the past three week to have his low-jack installed, protction package done, and window tint, but has not gotten a call from finance to set this up, if they sell the product, then they need to be aware that the customer service that we get as new car owners reflects on the entire dealership itself, so get that together guys because we will be doing buisenss there for the next few yrs.",4.6

272,"April 06, 2009","Well, I have no idea why people still decide to use Round Rock Nissan. Their customer service is still extremely poor. I installed a HAM radio in my truck. In order to do this, I had to remove the passenger seat. Because I did not disconnect the battery, the passenger airbag light started flashing. I had to take it in to have a computer code reset. No compassion. Charged me $65 + tax for a 3 minute task and did not even offer to let me off with a warning. In this day and age, it appears that screwing customers to get their money is far more important than retention of customers and customer service.

Since I have owned the 2009 vehicle, I have not had a single service done at that location and now I am happy that driving to South Point Nissan is definitely worth the effort. I should have driven down and had them reset the code for me.",1.6

274,"February 23, 2009","(1) On January 8, 2009 I left my 2002 Nissan Xterra at Maxwell Round Rock Nissan to have diagnostics performed because it was running rough.  Clint, my contact in the service department, quoted me $105 for this diagnostic work. I agreed to this charge and signed a ""PreWorkOrder"" indicating I agreed to the $105.

(2) Clint kept my vehicle for over a month trying to diagnose it.  First he thought it was a bad mass flow valve, then bad spark plugs/wires and a bad distributor cap, then a bad super charger… I continued to speak with him many, many times and I expressed concern about why it was taking so long while verifying over and over again that I would not be charged more than the $105.  Clint assured me there would be no additional charges beyond the $105. 

 (4) On February 18, 2009, Clint informed me that he was wrong again - the problem was not the super charger.  The problem was the compression on cylinder #4 was very low and that I need a new engine.  I asked Clint for a quote.

(5) The next morning, February 19th, Clint quoted me more than $5K.  I told him that was too much - the SUV was not worth much more than that.  I told him I wanted to pick up my SUV and asked when I could do so.   Clint then informed me he had put a new super charger on when they were doing their diagnostics and he would need to charge me labor to remove it, or....... I could pay for the new supercharger.  I told Clint that I was not paying for anything beyond the $105 because (1) he just told me the day before there was nothing wrong with my super charger, and (2) I had not authorized him to put a new super charger on my SUV.  He then told me the dealership would keep my SUV until I paid.  I asked him to have his supervisor, Jorg VanPatten, call me.  I never received a call back from him. 

(6) On February 20th, I went into the dealership in person to try to resolve this issue and also called in.  I was able to speak with Clint, Jorg, and Guy McRee, their General Manager.  All 3 of them informed me they had changed their mind.  They did not want to remove the super charger and insisted I keep it and pay for it.  They said they had just found out they could not return the super charger to Nissan because it is a ""performance part"".  I told them that what they were trying to do was fraudulent and that I would contact a lawyer. 

(7) That same day, after contacting a lawyer I again spoke to Jorg, the Service Manager, and Guy, the General Manager, over the phone.  I told them that under TX state law, it was illegal for them to replace my super charger when there was nothing wrong with it.  And, it was illegal for them to put a new super charger on my vehicle when I did not authorize them to do so.  I told them they needed to put my SUV back the way it was when I left it with them (put my old super charger back on, etc.) and to present me with some kind of bill.  I told them that I understood that legally, in order to get my SUV back, I had to pay whatever bill they presented me with.  But, even so, I did not agree with any charges besides the $105 and I would pursue this matter in court to get my money returned to me.  They agreed to return my SUV to its original state and to have it ready on February 23, 2009.

(8) At 6 pm on February 20th I sent an e-mail to Jorg and Guy reiterating the facts of what had happened.  I also told them the fraudulent acts they committed are covered under Texas state's Deceptive Trade Practices - Consumer Protection Act.  However, I would prefer to resolve this issue w/out litigation.  So, if they presented me with a bill on February 23rd for only $105 and they returned my SUV to the state it was in when I left it with them for diagnostics, I would consider this matter resolved and I would take no further action against them.
      (b) However, if they did not comply, then I would file a claim against them in civil court to recover my money.  In addition, I would file a consumer complaint with the Texas Attorney General, the Better Business Bureau, and the Federal Trade Commission. 

(9) On February 23rd they called me to say my SUV was ready.  I paid a bill for $1,687.25 and retrieved my SUV.  The charges were for the new supercharger (which they tried to get me to take with me, but I refused) and for labor charges to remove the new super charger and put my original one back on.  I wrote on every page of the invoice that I did not agree with the charges and that I had never authorized the purchase of any parts or repairs.

(10) They entered false information in the notes on the invoice, saying I had authorized installation of a new super charger because my old one was ""very noisy internally"".  However, they entered those notes on February 19, 2009 at 4:51 pm, 4:54 pm and 4:58 pm (date stamped by their own computer!).  This was well after I had already had my morning conversation with Clint telling him that I was not paying for parts and/or work I did not authorize.",1.0
275,"September 30, 2008","My salesperson was great. Very helpful and we found the vehicle that I wanted.

Before I went back to the dealership, the deal had already been agreed upon with my salesperson. Still, when I showed up I had to wait in excess of 45 minutes (with my 2 kids) to start the paperwork with the finance department. Now, if you have kids, you will understand that a 7 and 11 year old can only be patient for so long until boredom, hunger, arguing, etc kick in. When I finally did get in to see the finance person, everything started off fine and we started the paperwork. However, we hit a snag when he started to offer me the extras (GAP insurance, warranties, etc). When I declined the GAP insurance, he continued to press the issue. In fact, he made me feel like an idiot in front of my children for not taking it. This is absolutely unacceptable. When I declined it for the 4th and final time, he made me write on the piece of paper something to the effect of “I decline the insurance and assume all the risks” or something like that. From that moment on, his whole attitude changed and he was very rude and standoffish. Just because a customer does not want to purchase all the extras does not mean they need to be treated like an idiot. You can get cheaper GAP insurance from places other than dealers. In fact, I would recomment that you never purchase GAP insurance from a dealer as they inflate their prices. I have never heard of having to write this and can only assume that he did this to further belittle me. My neighbor works in the auto re-finance industry here in Austin and he had never heard of anyone having to write a sentence to decline insurance.

What was supposed to be a pleasurable experience turned into a sour one.

My salesperson walked me out to the truck and I told her about my experience. She laughed and suggested that I write to the manager. I failed to see the funny side of it. Now I do. He has never bothered to contact me.",1.8
