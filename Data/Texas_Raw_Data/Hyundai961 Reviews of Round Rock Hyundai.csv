7,"June 18, 2020","Not impressed with Kammi at all  Told us she called several times, no calls or voicemails. We brought the car in for what turned out to be warranty work, which was wonderful.  Then when we picked up the car, the A/C was not working., To whick it would be approximately $1,600. Both the tech and Kammi said when the car was tested it worked.  Then contradicted herself and said, well we don't know if it worked when you brought it in.  They had just told us it tested and worked.  Don't trust her.  ",3.0

Although he could have tried to influence us to purchase the more expensive Palisade, Adel HEARD my reluctance to pay for something I did not need - the third row seats. We purchased the Santa Fe Limited Turbo model instead, because Adel addressed everything I spoke I wanted in a real estate vehicle in that SUV .

39,"March 19, 2020","3500 mile service on GENESIS G90 that had promises made and raved about their service when we purchased it. 

WE made an appointment with Sean in service dept. He picked the time and date based on when a loaner car would be available. WE were thinking because he picked the date and time there should be no problems. WERE WE WRONG, first thing Tami (our service advisor) says is there isn't a loaner car and none were on computer for us. She wanted to know how we scheduled the service. I told her I called in and ordered service and needed loaner. Again she referred to computer stating there were none available and DID NOT  try to offer any suggests as to how to remedy our situation.

WE called in and did our part.  We, as were promised to receive the great service from GENESIS and get there and to find a back woods and unprofessional service dept.  Seems as though if they don't see it in the computer it doesn't exist.  WE did not purchase car from computer we did not schedule service with computer; we did it with employees of ROUNDROCK HYUNDAI and  WE hold them accountable for errors. 

I was told by the service manager they were NEVER going to service my car and take it someplace else. WE expect what was promised and what we PAID for, IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR.  When you purchase a top of the line vehicle you expect top of the line service. NOT BOTTOM OF THE BARREL.",1.0
40,"March 02, 2020","Very Unethical Dealership and unprofessional dealership we were wondering why people were arguing and getting kicked out. The dealership is only concerned with helping you if your skin is white. They will definitely do a bait and switch in addition just flat out lie to you. They won’t send your application to the bank they will instead tell you that your are denied and won’t tell you which banks denied you. In addition they are breaking FCRA statutes. By law If you were denied by any banks/lending company, you have a right to an adverse action letter and to know who received your information. Stay away from Aaron Hargrove and McKenzie they will totally waste your time. They won’t run your application to certain banks because they don’t want to absorb certain acquisition fees. Watch out this will be reported to the corporate office and how we were treated",1.0
41,"December 30, 2019","Miranda Simpson was the sales person who arrived to give us information about a new Santa Fe we were thinking about. She pulled the ""best match"" car around, put us in it, and proceeded to show us everything about the car in an informative and organized fashion before asking us to take a test drive. She knew everything about the car (a first for us...usually I know more than the sales person...I'm a researchholic). We left the dealership and headed to another potential dealer, meanwhile she was working up a potential offer for us...sale price, our trade in, etc. By the time we were home she had sent us all the info we wanted. We emailed and asked about a color/interior we wanted and she had it pulled around and ready for us the next day to drive as soon as we got to the dealer...all was what we wanted...the usual paperwork, but she did it as fast as could be done (a busy day with their sales incentives)...went over the car, answered all our questions. She  didn't let us off the lot without knowing everything we could (including setting up many of the options) about the car.  This was our best sales experience in 50 years of purchasing cars. Kudos to Miranda who says she prides herself in knowing all the cars/trims, etc. ",5.0
42,"November 12, 2019","Very long time to secure an appointment, scheduling problems, rude staff, etc. The list is long. Manager makes apology how staff need to be better trained and how they promise to do better, but after three years, I've now going to the south location for service needs. There has been no improvement, it just gets worse. In my four decades of having car repairs, this place is the worst when it comes to customer service. ",1.0
43,"October 06, 2019",I went to have a diagnostic test on my Sonata. They never did it and charged me for routine maintenance which I didn’t need! Later called In late September to make appointment and was told that first available was in November.? Terrible experiences here. Will never buy another Hyundai as the other Austin Dealership is so disorganized they don’t answer the phone. This week I traded my Sonata in on a Nissan. Mostly motivated by the poor business practices.,1.0
44,"September 05, 2019","I’ve worked with a lot of sales folks in my day. A general sales manager like Aaron Hargrove would’ve been fired so fast after telling a potential client he neither needed nor wanted his business. He said he’s ok if the cars sat on his lot because he didn’t want to go the extra mile to make a deal with me, the buyer. He seems like a very greedy general sales manager who’d rather trick people into higher prices so he can stuff his pockets. Unbelievably disappointing. My family and I (who own six Hyundai’s) will be switching our business to another brand. ",1.0
45,"August 30, 2019","I just got off the phone with the service department at RR Hyundai.  Today is 8/30/19.  They can get my car in for service mid-October.  The car just rolled over 12K miles.  It's for an issue that I reported to them when the car only had 2K miles on it (radio/sound/phone bluetooth all goes out radomly)....but they couldn't duplicate the issue.  Now, it's so bad that the system is rarely working.  I can't make bluetooth calls, which is why I got a new car to begin with.  To take over a month to schedule getting my car into their service department for repairs is unacceptable.  I'm quite disappointed.",2.0
46,"April 14, 2019","UPDATE (4/16/19)
Will and JR both went the extra mile to make things right. JR drove a loaner to our house, picked up the car, and over the next day they replaced the missing bolts, and most importantly fixed the oil leaks from the turbo. 

While it's not a perfect review due to having frustrations in the first place, those two both did a great job working to make it right.

Original Review:
Brief summary:
Our (75k mi) Hyundai blew its engine while driving back from work about a month ago, and I seriously regret having it towed here, in spite of how nice the facilities look. Our car
-Was used to store old parts, without anything to protect the interior
-Was delivered with the charge pipe - on the top of the engine - absolutely loose and ready to strand me the second I got on the highway
-After it was taken back in for a ""look over"", I get home and find more loose clamps, bolts completely missing from where they should be and oil leaking all over the turbo. 

Absolutely some of the most inexcusable work from any shop, let alone a DEALERSHIP.

Long Version:
Rewind about a month ago, and after the car was towed there, we get a call from JR - our service adviser - telling us that the car has a dead battery and it wouldn't be covered by Hyundai (never mind that it was fine before having to get towed). We head over, replace the battery since it was on a separate warranty, and notice that the passenger seat has old parts, bolts, new parts, and the rear seat has an oily under-tray in it, all without any sort of protection for the interior.

I email JR pictures along with a polite ""please take better care of our car"".. no response. I call up JR later, when he says something to the effect of ""sorry, I will definitely raise that up to my manager"". A few weeks go by, and I think to myself ""even if he did anything about it, I should probably still send a reminder to the service manager. Will (Service Manager) was super courteous, said they were going to inspect it and give it a wash even though they don't normally do it for warranty work.

Frankly, Will is the only reason this review is two stars rather than one.  

Finally go to pick the car up, open the hood, and right on TOP of the engine (didn't even have to remove anything), the charge pipe that delivers air from the turbo is absolutely loose - I can just spin it around with my finger. I call JR over, and then a tech comes out with a screwdriver.. and at this point I ask ""can you *please* take a look at the car and make sure there's nothing else like this?""

Get the car home, and the air inlet hose is also loose, the bracket that bolts the turbo to the block has two bolts that are obviously missing, and there's fresh oil *all* over the turbo and all over the belly pan.",3.4

I had started off with a bad experience with the sales man, Johnny, but then General mgr and sales mgr. reached out to me and corrected the situation and gave me a better deal. Hats off to Mr. Williams , general manager, and also to the patience , Sales mgr. Aaron Hargrove who heard me , helped me and used this experience to turn out better! Dre, is good sales man, real, and helps you understand you car and it's technology. I like my car a lot but recently needed to get tint redone a 3 time on one window. I know they contract out to Austin Tint Doctors, now, and when I reached out I felt like I was pushed aside or like the dealership was not going to bat for me and saying fix this window tint right. I had to contact dealership several times and Salesman finally had me contact tint place directly to get work done. I had to get #, address, and find location myself. Major inconvenience, not mention feeling like dealership wasn't as supportive as they could have been and were allowing tint guy to say some how I damaged the tint, which was clearly NOT the case. This is why I dropped the dealership from 5 star to 3 star.

48,"March 04, 2019","We test drove a used truck on the lot late Saturday evening with James Hilliard and spent an hour with him going over price, trade in payment plan choices and committed to the purchase at 5:30 on the following Monday with both James Hilliard and the Sales Manager, Lance Gremillion.  

Financing was arrange early Monday morning with our credit union and the loan approval was communicated to James mid Monday morning.  He responded ""Perfect I'll let them know.  As I was leaving to go complete the paperwork and purchase the truck I receive a text telling me they had just sold the truck (4:30 PM). 

This is why used car salesmen have the reputation they have.  Buyer beware if you do business at this dealership.  Get it in writing and do not trust their hand shakes and verbal commitments.  They get the first dollar available and do not care how it affects any prior commitment.",1.0
49,"January 31, 2019","Dre, salesman is very good at what he does and he lets you ask questions, and lets you come to conclusion of what type of car you need! He is like a walking owners manual and will answer any questions so you get the most out of your car. He is respectful, nice, and cares about making you happy.  Aaron, sales manager is hands on and helped make my purchase of my lovable Elantra. ",4.5
50,"September 25, 2018","Sales experience was typical. Multiple sales offers for a certain payment amount with which the numbers didn’t add up correctly to the sales price and interest rate offered. “Oh we’re sorry” that payment amount included extra warranties etc that we didn’t want. Round two more of the same. Finally, they come back with a transparent offer that matched the sales price after we said we were leaving. But beware, I should have paid closer attention to my final documents; the finance guy put 61 payments in my loan contract instead of 60. Another lesson learned. This is why car salesmen have bad reputations. I won’t be returning. ",1.0

After that, I contacted perhaps fifteen other Hyundai dealers from Houston to Dallas and negotiated with many of them, but some turned me off with their tactics.  I wanted to return to Tyler to try to make a deal with someone that struck me as honest at a dealership that didn't play games with unlisted add-ons. At Round Rock Hyundai I was able to negotiate a fair price on the exact vehicle I wanted.  At no point did I feel stressed or pressured.

Buying a car is not easy, but this dealership made it easy and actually enjoyable. Everyone there treats you like family and is very professional. If I had a question that they did not know the answer to, they passed the buck and got back to me so that my question was answered. They were not one bit aggressive and I did not feel threatened at any point. I also want to say that they are VERY family friendly. I brought my 11 year old brother with me and they included him when asking how we liked the car, and when I had to do the paperwork, they asked him what he wanted to watch on TV knowing that it was going to be a time consuming process.

Eric educated me on Hyndai,  answered logically when I compared apples to oranges with other vehicles. Eric was the first salesman in the three weeks of my searching that made me feel like his job was to make sure I was informed with facts, happy with what I choose, and not just another sale. The GM, Mike Williams (who came referred by a friend), came out to say hello, and was just as professional as Erik. Excellent group of folks here.

More than just verbally expressing my gratitude, which also pleased her, returning for another helping was a tangible display of just how much I enjoyed her meal.  In a similar fashion, perhaps even more telling, is returning to the same dealership where you purchased your first vehicle to purchase your second, especially when you could have gone anywhere. It says something not only about the quality and satisfaction found in the first vehicle itself, but, perhaps even moreso, about the experience surrounding that first purchase which motivated the buyer, in this case, myself, to return to purchase a second vehicle. It demonstrates a level of trust and expectation of respect, standards which were set by the first experience, to be met, if not exceeded, in the second, subsequent purchase. And I am pleased to report those standards were not only met, but, indeed, exceeded.  In an age when customer service seems to have fallen by the wayside, it is exceptionally gratifying to be able to conduct business with those who have already established a commitment to the highest levels of service to their customers and find them striving to exceed those levels that have already earned not only your business a second time but your admiration as well.",5.0

We would highly recommend this dealership over other dealers in the area because of the way this dealership is managed.

Our trade in was valued fairly and the pricing and financing on our new vehicle was likewise structured acceptably.

Hector found a car which matched what we requested, and the entire negotiation for the price and when the vehicle would be ready was completed through email.

He took us through several test drives because he understood how important it was for me to be absolutely sure I was making the right decision between the Tucson and Santa Fe Sport. While discussing numbers, which was the part I was dreading, he did an amazing job explaining everything, so the whole process was actually quite easy! I felt confident I was getting a fair deal on the Porsche I traded in, and drove off the lot in my brand new 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport, with more bells and whistles I could ever hope for!

This dealer left me with a good feeling about the purchase of my Genesis in 2013 so I cam by to look at another Hyundai.

Dealer was more prepared and provided an intelligent salesman who did all in his power to make me welcome and after a drive, we settled on a price in about 15 minutes- a record for me.

357,"April 28, 2017","With the exception of the wait for financing (which I get is due to it being a particularly busy day), it was the best car buying experience we've ever had.    James was EXTREMELY helpful and no pressure - he first showed me a number of vehicles when I was starting my search, talking me through the pros & cons of an SUV vs mini-van, and then later when I finally figured out specifically what I wanted, he showed us multiple SUVs from different partner dealers (Hyundai, Toyota, Honda).  Each time, I felt like he was giving his honest opinion, and didn't feel at all biased towards one particular vehicle because he'd get a bigger commission.  He answered my questions, and patiently allowed me to obsess over little differences while I made my decision. During the negotiation process, he showed the same patience and understanding, and worked with us to make a deal that made both sides happy.  I would definitely recommend using James at Round Rock Hyundai to my friends.   Despite the long wait for financing (apparently, it was a VERY busy day!), once I was in the finance office, it was much faster than I had previously experienced when buying a car, and again, low pressure.

The good service from Mark and the dealership started last year when I was there for a recall of my 2006 Hyundai Azera.  Mark visited with me to see if I was interested in buying a car or even test driving one.  I told him I would be buying the next year and he handed me his card and told me to get in touch with him then.  I was SOLD in that moment!!

After the road test came the negotiations of price and payment, while a few minor details had to be changed in order to make the deal happen I still felt 100% satisfaction on the terms of the deal. The finance manager and Yakila both worked hard to get my family the best deal possible. After all the paper work was signed we were walked through the guides and every feature in detail. Our phones were set up and the car was detailed perfectly, at least in our eyes, Yakila thought otherwise and had the car takend back for a quick spot cleaning. This definitely impressed me, the papers were signed and we were about to be on our marry way but Yakila wanted it to be perfect.

I was trying to coordinate an out of state purchase and they couldn't even connect with me to confirm the car was still there so I could confirm my travel plans there! After endless hours on hold, daily phone calls and emails without a response for more than 6 WEEKS, they sold the car to someone else! First they gave me 2 different prices, one if financed and another without financing, which I think is illegal. Once I addressed this, they finalized the purchase price, we were good to go. But every time I tried to arrange my trip there, they never confirmed they still had the car and REFUSED to hold it until I got there! They were also the only dealership that will not take a deposit, to avoid this anguish and they also refused to pick me up from the airport, after I'd be paying at least $400 for a one way ticket!  Their genius manager's solution was: Call us from the airport right before you buy the ticket and leave and we'll try to hold the car until you arrive. Right, as if I'm buying it at the counter for over $1000 on day of travel?? This is how typically inconsiderate and calloused this dealership is towards their customers, not understanding the need for advance travel plans.

850,"June 04, 2013","I went to the dealership to buy a new Azera.  I worked with a great salesman and everything went well.  He had to go home early so I was left with another salesperson and that's where it went downhill!  First, I was waiting for my paperwork to be completed and was passed by an employee who stared me down.  I asked him, ""why you frowning"" at which point he said, ""I ain't frowning, what the xxxx is it to you!""  He then stood there and stared at me until I walked away.  I found the floor manager, Bo Lusher and explained the situation.  He didn't seem surprised, for some reason, but was calm and friendly.  I asked him to remove the employee until I finished my transaction.  He said fine but 20 minutes later the employee who accosted me returned and sat at the table next to me!  The store Manager, Mike Williams, was out of the dealership celebrating his daughter's graduation.  When he returned, Bo asked me if I'd like to speak with Mike. It was at that point Bo told me the offending employee's father had just died so I said, ""just drop it then"".  He asked me to talk with him anyway.  I went in Mike's office and it was at that point he began blaming the situation on me and stating the other sales person with whom I was working felt uncomfortable working through the transaction and wanted to be replaced.  I had to ask for the keys to my car several times before they finally gave them to me.  Mike followed me around the dealership several times continually engaging me in aggressive conversations.  I then asked him, ""Isn't the customer always right?"" He said, ""No"".  I said, ""I'll just call Hyundai USA and let them deal with the situation, what do you think will happen"".  He said, ""I'll make it go away.""  I finally got my keys and asked if I could leave my old car there overnight so I could arrange to pick it up later.  Bo then stated, ""it might be safer if you took it elsewhere"".

Funny thing is the employee accused me of calling him a name.  I then asked the manager to remove the camera evidence of our conversation and review it to see if what I was telling him was, in fact, the truth.  He said he would but then said they weren't operational and he wouldn't be able to review the situation!

I can't make this kind of thing up, trust me.  I can't believe this happened and I would have left without purchasing the car if I hand't had the deal almost completed and they had the new car I wanted.  

I will say the guys in service I met were professional and their new dealership was impressive.  Bo did everything he could to manage a horrible situation and was as helpful as he could be considering the situation. I would never go back there anyway but it was recommended I take my service elsewhere.  

I certainly hope, if you go there, you NEVER experience this type of treatment.  Good Luck!",2.4

We noted that the leg-room in the 2010 Santa Fe was different than the 2012 so we went to visit the dealer to try on a newer one.

Jeff had a Dealer Loaner, 2011 Santa Fe Limited that was configured just the way we wanted it.  We bought it about 60 days before we planned to buy because the car and the price were right.

And the difference in attitude between Brian and the guys at Southpoint is STARK! I turned down Southpoint's last-ditch $500 drop in price in order to work with Brian. Ok, well, there were other reasons, but I like saying that the service at RR was worth $500 to me.

I decided to call Round Rock Hyundai to see what they could do, and quickly learned from Eiji that I was actually about to pay much more for the Tuscon in Houston. I immediately turned the car around drove to Round Rock Hyundai, and we had the deal closed in a few hours. Eiji's professionalism and non-nonsense approach was so refreshing, and made my entire experience fantastic. He was very detailed in his explanations of all the great features of the car, but it felt more like I was talking to someone I had known my whole life.

They did not have the exact Genesis Coupe that I wanted (there were only 5 black Genesis Coupes in the state of Texas) so they worked hard to get the exact car I wanted within two days. Jason, the finance manager, also worked with me and showed me all of my options. He even gave me recommendations on which insurance policies I should look into(i.e. GAP). I really felt like royalty when I picked up my new car - everyone at the dealership asked me if I was excited about my new Genesis Coupe. Aaron even took the time to show me all the features of my car again and even helped me set up the Bluetooth on my phone so I can talk hands-free in my car!

883,"October 27, 2011","This was my first car buying experience so I was a little nervous about making my largest purchase thus far in my life. I was looking for a new car with a great mpg rating as well as a good safety rating. I did lots of research online so that I would be well informed to make my first car purchase. I was referred to the Round Rock Hyundai dealership by my fiance who lives in Austin. Her dad and sister both bought their new Hyundai vehicles from Jeff Karnes, and they both had very enjoyable experiences and highly recommended Jeff. So I decided to meet Jeff to test drive one of the new Elantras. Jeff was not pushy whatsoever about selling me a new car, but rather just told me a little about the car. Since I lived in San Antonio, I was going to check out some of the dealerships in my area first. I contacted a few dealerships, asked about availability, prices and such. However, at that time, I felt like I was not in a place where I could fully commit to buying a car, and Jeff was very understanding. He kept in contact and worked with me for a few months until I felt comfortable and ready. I shopped around for the best price for the exact car I wanted down to the color and optional package. Jeff and the Round Rock dealership agreed to match the best price. Jeff worked hard to find me the perfect car for me and he was never pressuring me to purchase a new car. He allowed me to make the purchase in my own time. I thank Jeff and the entire Round Rock Hyundai dealership for a very enjoyable first car-buying experience.",5.0

We had 3 days in Austin and could not afford to have anything go wrong.  From the moment I talked to Eiji it seemed like he really took a personal interest in coming through for us - he kept me informed as to what cars were coming in and searched high and low for the car, color and options we wanted.  Elantra's move fast.  We would have been devastated to travel thousands of miles and not get to witness our lovely daughter driving away in her new car.  Eiji treated all of us with respect and a kind mannerism that really impressed all of us- my parents were with us as it was a gift from them.  Eiji had all the paperwork in order, we worked out a great price all over email and phone calls and there wasn't a single glitch.  He took time with my daughter to go over all components of the vehicle and made sure to let us know that Round Rock would be there to help her with any issues or maintenance.  Eiji has been the most professional, sincere and organized salesperson I have ever worked with and I highly recommend asking for him and choosing Round Rock for your purchase.  This might sound ridiculous but we feel like we have a new friend in Austin - Now how many people can say that about their car salesman?  He is a true professional.",5.0

He wasn't the standard ""car salesman"" most people encounter when trying to purchase a car. I've heard stories about sales reps harrassing their ""potential"" customers/buyers in hopes of making a sale.   Jeff on the other hand was the total opposite!  

He followed thru on his promises and worked with my husband and I to help me get the car I wanted!  After purchasing my car, Jeff stayed after work to review the details of my car and help set up some of my features! His wonderful personality made me feel more like a friend than a customer. 

Thank you again for your wonderful service Jeff! Keep up the great work!  If I have any family or friends shopping for a car, I will send them your way!

This is the first new vehicle I have ever purchased so I was at first weary of having to deal with the stereotypical car salesperson, but after hearing some positive reviews for this place I thought I would give it a try. My salesperson Eiji, was very knowledgeable and not pushy whatsoever. We test drove the fully loaded Veloster, and I dug the car but wasn't sure if all the bells and whistles were for me. I thought Eiji might got into a spiel and try to sell me on all the extras but he was just the opposite and wanted me to make sure I had a car I wanted and not a car they had to sell. I ended up getting a Veloster with just the style package and am very satisfied. From the sales floor to the financial staff you will have a friendly and welcoming experience at RR Hyundai. ",4.8

He was very knowledgeable about the Sonata and helped us to realize the awesomeness  of the vehicle.  The colors were exactly what we wanted and the price was the lowest of 3 other Sonata's we were considering.  Really cool to drive away in the car you really want!!  Also would like to mention Robert Graham the Finance Mgr. worked the best interest rate and was incredibly fast and accurate with the could be lengthy paperwork process. He also kept his word on a after the deal Ibex int./ext treatment and gave us a great price.  We were a bit after business hours to pick up the vehicle and he made it possible to drive it home --now-- anyway.

When I called back, he provided all the information I wanted and was not pushy about trying to get me to come in right away.  A couple of days later, we tentatively set up an appointment, not only to look at the Elantra and Sonata, but told him I also wanted to see the Honda Civic, CR-V, Toyata RAV-4, and Camry... he said no problem.  While visiting all these models on the adjacent lots when the temp was 104 degrees, Eiji patiently answered my questions and pointed out things I hadn't thought to ask.  
After sitting behind the wheel of the stationary vehicles, I was able to rule out the ones I wasn't interested in test driving... only the Elantra and Sonata made the list.  During the test drive of both of these vehicles, it was apparent to me it had to be the Sonata... this was my decision, Eiji didn't push me toward the more expensive car.  During the test drive, I felt he was a friend, someone I had known a long time, not just a salesman trying to get his next sale.  

So now I knew what vehicle I wanted, just needed some help on deciding the color.  Not only Eiji, but also some of his team members pointed me to the Silver Blue Iridescent Pearl, which I love!  And knowing I could have leather seats on the GLS versus having to 'upgrade' to the more expensive model that had options I wasn't interested in, really helped seal the deal.  Eiji must have spent at least 3 hours with me that hot Friday afternoon and I felt he was really went out of his way to provide great customer service.  His dealership is 20 miles from my house, but after working with him, I knew RR Hyundai would take good care of me and my new Sonata.  I also David Vinson and the Finance gentleman, sorry, don't remember name, who helped me complete the deal who were both very good and pleasant to work with.  Also, Julianna in the Accessories dept was outstanding and very helpful.

I don't buy cars very often it's been 16 years since I bought my last one, and I had been dreading the 'haggle' game.  Eiji proved to me that buying a new car could be a pleasant experience and now I only wish I had done it sooner.

There was no pressure, no games, just helpfulness.  I felt like Mark gave me honest answers to my questions and he gave offered applicable recommendations.  I recommend and would buy from Mark again!  The closing was also easier than any of my previous purchasing experiences.  Even associates who passed me in the lobby were genuinely friendly with me despite knowing I was working with someone already who would be getting my sale.  It's refreshing to be in a car dealership and not have to feel like you have to keep your guard up!",5.0
926,"October 19, 2010","I was very suprised by the courtesy and friendliness displayed by the salesmen. They were very knowledgeable of the vehicle I bought. I did a little research before shopping, and found their prices to be very fair. I would recommend this dealership and salesmen to anyone. ",5.0
927,"September 01, 2010","I’m not usually big on writing reviews, but I was so impressed with my experience that I feel like I should share it.  

I have been doing research on buying a new car for about two months.  I had no idea what kind of car I wanted but I read about EVERYTHING.  I read about car salesmen and dealerships and how dishonest they can be.  I researched pricing and financing on every site you can think of.  Needless to say I was prepared for the worst.  

Because of my research, I began to deal with all sales over the internet.  I found it easier to work with pricing upfront rather than in the stressful atmosphere of the dealership. Bo Lusher in internet sales was the opposite of everything I heard about car salesmen.  He was helpful, honest, and not pushy what-so-ever.  After visiting eight dealerships it was so refreshing to find such a real person that I knew I would purchase a car from him!  In addition to Bo, the finance man James was also very helpful.  
Overall, my experience was great.  I love my car and I feel pretty lucky.

My wife and I just bought a new Sonata from the Round Rock Hyundai dealership and for both of us it was a great experience. Our sales representative Adel Bssaeso presented all the facts about the vehicle, answered all our questions to the fullest and focused on our needs. We had researched already a great price, when we walk into the dealership, but Adel was still able to offer us an even better price. The paperwork was straight forward and without any surprises. We were informed about further offers and options, but instead of being pressured into another purchase, we received the material to review at home. During the following walk-through of the vehicle Adel personally verified a full gas tank and showed us our spotless car. He explained every detail of the interior and even helped to configured the hands-free Bluetooth connection for our cell phone. We can highly recommend Mr. Adel Bssaeso to anybody, as well as the Round Rock Hyundai dealership. My wife and I are looking forward to enjoy our new Hyundai Sonata and hope it will be as pleasant as our buying experience.

929,"August 26, 2010",I visited Round Rock Hyundai for a new car for my daughter who had graduated and licensed as Registered Nurse (RN). She was offered a job but just before she started a driver colided with her parked car. The car was totalled and you can imagine her frustration. Someone referred us to Round Rock Hyundai and we met a freindly and couteous saleman by name Charles Inoti.  He gave us the best customer service I have ever received. He answered to our satisfaction every question that we asked and gave us very useful information we did not even know about the purchase.  Before the end of business that day my daughter drove home a brand new Hyundai Elantra. Round Rock Hyundai is a dealership to do business with.  Keep up the good work.,5.0
930,"August 18, 2010","My husband and I needed a vehicle with more load space and it was my turn to drive one.  I loved my Lexus ES300 and didn't think I'd come close to liking another vehicle as well.   The sales associate, Paul Clevlen, was patient with me as we drove a Tucson and then a Santa Fe. The Santa Fe surprised me. It lacked some things my Lexus had but it did have other features my Lexus didn't have. I went home and did some online research and also investigated financing from my credit union.  When I returned to the dealership, Paul found a Santa Fe with a nav system and sun roof that I liked even better than the one I had driven previously.  It was even red!  After an afternoon of back-and-forth, I was satisfied with the deal I got and I drove the car home later that day.  I like it more each day I drive it.  I took it in recently for the window tinting and was also impressed with the service department (Iris)and the accessories department (Juliana).  I look forward to dealing with these people in the future.",5.0
931,"August 12, 2010","I visited this dealership with hope of finding a car not a brand new one, but due to the proffessionalism that Mr. Inoti exhibited and the knowledge, he made me come to the realiasation of the importance of me investing in a new car versus all the the other option I was considering.Great advice and investment. I am already enjoying my purchase and would highly recommend Mr. Inoti to anybody, as well as the dealership.",5.0

They have a huge inventory and they can get you the car of your choice quickly if they don't have it in their inventory. We had 2 options, one was in their inventory and the other they called up other dealerships and guaranteed to have it within 2 hours. Adel was helpful during the purchase providing us all options and he didn't push anything on us, we really felt comfortable buying the car of our choice. They also helped through with the financing and we completed the purchase and drove our new car in about 2 hrs. Following up on the purchase I even recommended my friend to go buy from them and he did end up buying from them. ",4.8

I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to find a good dealer that you can trust in this car hunting process.  James Dicus is extremely knowledgeable and friendly.

I purchased a Honda in 2005 from this dealership, had all my services done, and felt that this would be the perfect starting place for looking for my Hyundai.  I had a very specific model I was looking for (color and options) so I e-mailed all the Austin Hyundai dealerships.  All the other dealerships tried to get me on the phone to talk me into buying what they had on their lot.  I was happy that Johnny actually e-mailed me indicating that the model I wanted they didn't have on their lot, but I could look at a similiar model and if I didn't want it they would find the model that I did want. Johnny was incredibly friendly, very helpful and straight forward in the numbers, and most importantly found me the car I wanted.

948,"June 19, 2010","Our experience with Round Rock Hyundai could not have been better.  I originally spent two hours with James Dicus.

James Barnett was the Business Manager who processed the paperwork and closing.

BOTTOM LINE - we could not have asked for a better group of people.  All were informative, courteous and helpful.  Any questions we had were answered.  Anytime we asked for suggestions, they were very forthcoming and honest.  The result was that we got a great car at a great price, and we felt that we would always be welcome there in the future for servicing or any other car needs that might arise.

He gave us a tour of the repair facility, showed us how if the car did need service there were loaner cars available.  The overall experience was fantastic.  All of our questions were answered.

Donnie Arnold listened to our needs and what we were looking for. He didn't push at all. Unlike other dealership that just point and push you into a car in the hope that you will like it.  Donnie was great!  I didn’t even know what car I wanted at the time – But Donnie talked to me and my wife about what we had and what our needs were.  He helped me find the perfect fit and everything I wanted and asked about, I got on my new car!  Then it just gets better.  James Barnett got me the financing that no other dealership could.  I don’t have the best credit score.  James got me a better rate than my credit union could do for me!  At this point, It’s a no brainer.  Best price, Best warranty, and all the features I wanted and no “add on” features that I know I didn’t want to pay for.  It was perfect, smooth and an easy transaction!

I looked at reviews before car shopping and after being let down with false promises and prices from the South Point Hyundai dealership, I decided to contact Round Rock Hyundai. Mark Cheatham responded very quickly to my emails, and also called to ask me what I wanted in my new vehicle and introduced himself. Unlike the other dealership, he did not bother me by calling and emailing me numberous times throughout the day. When I arrived, I was quickly acknowledged and greeted (unlike my experience with Nissan), and they even had a play area to keep my children entertained. Nicole Bssaeso helped me look at ALL available options, and answered all of my many questions with no hesitation. Jason Laguna came in to help with all other paperwork and also assisted me by answering my questions and making me feel comfortable about the vehicle I was purchasing. The detailing serivce did a great job as well and everyone in that office was very friendly. I felt a better vibe at this location and my experience was simple and comforting. Nicole even played with my children while I spoke with Jason. I usually do not write reviews, however, I truly appreciate all of the hard work, time, and honestly that I received at Round Rock Hyundai and I would like the experience to be acknowledged.

955,"May 07, 2010","After much research and consideration, I made a trip to Austin to visit my son, with the express purpose of assisting him with the lease of a new automobile.  We had decided, due to the advertised lease programs, and great reviews that he would test drive a Honda Accord, Hyundai Sonata and Toyota Camry, determine which vehicle performed the best and which dealer would give him the best deal on before determining which one to purchase.  It turned out that Round Rock Dealership was the perfect place for us as it is in actuality three dealerships in one.  In the Honda dealership we were introduced to Pamela Luong, our sales representative who was both attentive and knowledgeable.  After describing in detail the attributes of the Honda Accord and taking us for a test drive, we informed her of our plan to test drive each of the cars and negotiate on our favorite.  Pamela explained the uniqueness of the Round Rock Dealership and let us know that she could help us purchase whichever of the three cars we wanted.  After test driving the Hyundai Sonata, my son determined it was his favorite.  After brief and professional negotiation with Pamela and Jason Laguna, we were ready to sign the paperwork and sign over the title for the trade in.  My son and I were treated with the utmost dignity and respect.  Pamela and Jason made my sons' first automobile lease/purchase both special and unique.  They were so sweet as to even pose for pictures with my son and his new car. I would recommend Pamela Luong and Jason Laguna of the Round Rock Dealership to anyone who is looking for a fair, easy and honest automobile purchase or lease experience.  They are truly the Best!!!

956,"May 05, 2010","I gave Steve Garza these ratings because he was very friendly and not pushy at all. He worked with my time schedule without any problem. He went above and beyond the call of duty with my car purchasing experience. It was late that night (9:30) and he actually went out and got my husband and I dinner and brought it back to the dealership. He did this on his own without our prior knowledge. He made sure that all of our needs and wants were taken care of as far as purchasing our vehicle. After the purchase he made sure everything went well when I had my windows tinted by Hyundai as well. I would recommend him to anyone I know who is looking to purchase a vehicle.
I feel that Steve should get at the very least employee of the month. He is an amazing person and is a great asset to your company. We need more people like him in the car sales business as most car salesmen are very pushy. He is not.
I have referred friends there and am sure they had a good experience as well.
I would for sure return to him when I purchase another vehicle in the future. He is always smiling and more than ready to help people.",4.8
957,"May 04, 2010","After researching the 2010 Sonata, I decided to go drive one and, if satisfied, buy it.  My time at the dealership turned out to be the best buying experience of my life.  

I had been drawn to your earlier model Sonata for a couple of years now and decided finally to take the plunge.  Mark Cheatham helped me with some quotes online prior to my visit to the dealership.  When I arrived at the dealership to drive a new 2010 Sonata, I was greeted by Yakila Hollins.  While we were getting to know a little about each other, one of the new 2011 Sonatas was driven up and parked by the front door.  When I saw this car, my first reaction was that it belonged to a customer and must be something other than a Hyundai.  Surely, Hyundai doesn’t make cars that are as beautiful as this.  Yakila told me it was there new arrival and asked me to take a ride.  If I recall, I bought the car that same day.

I will recommend the sales team of Mark Cheatham, Yakila Hollins and Jason Laguna to everyone I see.  This was the buying experience of a lifetime.  Thank you for having a sales team that is knowledgeable, compassionate, concerned and possesses a sense of humor.

I have bought 28 cars over my lifetime and often feel self-conscious in a showroom believing I am just a notch on the bedpost of the salesman's quota. 

This was not the case with Round Rock Hyundai; Mr. Yakilla Hollins made me feel welcome, and gave me his undivided attention during the three visits I made to the dealership as I shopped the 2011 Sonatas.  He must have turned his cell phone off, because never once did he make me feel rushed or that he had other obligations.

Kudos to this dealership!",5.0
959,"May 01, 2010","We have bought several vehicles both new and used from Round Rock Hyundai.  All of our non-simple maintenance and service work is also done at this dealership and I have had total satisfaction with the quality of work.
The sales staff is friendly, and best of all, not pushy.  The feeling I got was more of an organization that was proud of it's product and people and establishing a true customer relationship and less about making a ""quick buck"" on a one time sale.
Johnny Choe answered all of our questions, showed us all the different models that met our needs and was knowlegable of the differences in them.  We were allowed extended test drives in each and drove the cars wherever we wanted, not some ""pre-determined"" test loop.  Once the vehicle was decided on, and not available in the local inventory, Johnny was quick to find one exactly equipped as we wanted, in the color we wanted, and had it brought in.
One of the things I have noticed is that over the years you see the same employees in the sales and service departments.  In my book that indicates management that selects quality people and takes care of them.  I figure that if the workers are happy with management, they are more likely to want to make me happy, too.

I would definitely recommend this dealership to Hyundai shoppers.",5.0
960,"April 30, 2010","I was very pleased with my experience at Round Rock Hyundai. Mark was very pleasant, professional, and courteous; unlike some of the Sales Representatives at other dealerships I've visited in the area.
