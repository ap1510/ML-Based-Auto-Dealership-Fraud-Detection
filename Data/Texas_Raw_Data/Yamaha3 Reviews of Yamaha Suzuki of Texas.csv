0,"April 29, 2011","Brought my bike in for a taillight repair in November before putting it down for the winter.  I took it back out about a month ago and now its in need for the exact same $300 repair.  The service manager says they have liability for this because too much time went by when they can plainly see how much mileage was put on the bike over that time.  Basically didn't fix my bike correctly the first time and are now going to steal another $300.  This is how a customer that has spent thousands of dollars in their service drive is treated after years of loyalty.  I will never do any kind of business with this store again.
