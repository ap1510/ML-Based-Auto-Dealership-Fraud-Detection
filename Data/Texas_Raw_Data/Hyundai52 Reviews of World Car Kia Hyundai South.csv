0,"January 31, 2019","I was in the market to buy a Hybrid car/suv. I saw an ad on a 2017 Ford C Max Hybrid that World Car South had. I contacted them & made an appointment to look at. The salesman was helpful until the sale was completed. There were a couple of things that were to be taken care of by the dealer. The finance Dept were fantastic to deal with. After the sale, our salesman acted like he could care less. My problems began when I tried to get the items the dealer agreed to taken care of. I left numerous phone messages to the salesman with no response. Next I called the sales manager & finally had an appointment to have things taken care of. 1. License plate bracket. 2. Second programmed key. 3. Under dash cover. 4. Fuse box cover. I took the car in to the dealer. After waiting for a couple of hours, they said they had to take the car next door to the Ford dealer as they (World car) could not program the key. They were going to do this immediately when I got there. They didnâ€™t want to pay the Ford dealer if they could do it themself. I spent hours waiting for this to get done. I spoke with the (non) service Mgr. What a worthless xxx. He ended up telling me to get out of the dealership.  I told him to go to xxxx. I then contacted the GM (Hilton). I told him of the problems I had with the salesman, sales manager & service mgr. I told him with having problems with these different people, the problem lies with management. He said he would get me taken care of. He has failed three times call me when he said he would. He is great at apologizing. Just not great at taking care of a customer. The so called service manager should be fired & never work in anything service oriented. I am 68 years old & have purchased more cars than I can remember. This is the worst experience dealing with a car dealer I have ever had. I will not ever deal with anything to do with World Car. I even put a call in to the owner. Guess what?  He never called me back. Do yourself a favor, deal with anyone else but World Car. Oh by the way,  lifetime warranty. My car was a 2017 with less than 12,000 mi.  No warranty.  What a joke. ",1.2

16,"April 28, 2017","I'M ACTUALLY IN THE MARKET FOR A KIA BUT I'M NOT GOING TO BUY THAT DOES DECEPTIVE PRACTICES LIKE SENDING OUT FLIERS THAT SAY IF YOU SCRATCH OFF THREE MATCHING CIRCLES YOU ARE A WINNER. SO MY THREE CIRCLES SAID $1000. I WENT TO THE DEARLERSHIP AND THEY HAD A GIANT POSTER BOARD WITH A BUNCH OF NUMBERS ON IT. THEY LOOKED AT MY FLIERS AND SAID THAT I WOULD HAVE WON IF MY ""confirmation number "" WOULD HAVE MATCHED. THIS IS CALLED DECEPTIVE PRACTICE FOR A REASON. IT PISSES PEOPLE OFF FOR NOW GOOD REASON AND I WILL NOT BE DOING ANY BUSINESS WITH THEM. ",1.0
17,"April 13, 2017","Please read above , I came prepared to pay in full for the vehicle.  I researched what the car should cost. I had the sales managers name  that I was supposed to meet. The sales manager would not meet me and the price had unexpected additional prices that I  didn't expect.  It also took  an incredible length of time even after I delivered a cashiers check  for the full purchase price.",2.0

23,"November 10, 2016","We researched the car, knew what we wanted and communicated that to the dealership before our visit. Surprisingly, they were very well prepared when we arrived. They had the car we asked for ready for a test drive and provided us their offer for us to react to. The offer was very favorable and required no countering on our part. This included a trade in for our car which was very fair. We were even pleased with our experience with the finance department. He did not try to upsell us, just merely pointed out what was available, what benefit it offered, and how much cost would be added. Once we declined there was no pushy sales routine. Overall, the best buying/selling experience we've ever had.",5.0

They gave me a fair value for my trade in and even though the experience took longer than I expected they made it as smooth as possible.  At this point I have no regrets about the Sonata that we purchased.,4.6
34,"March 21, 2016","when I arrived at the dealership I was mislead by the internet department, right color wrong trim level upon arriving and finding this out I was rather mad, Pete Yeo the general sales manager did a great job listening to my complaint and even as if I would like him to locate the vehicle at a different dealership, that was amazing and I calmed down listen to what he had to say customers were more important than the sale, there was one at a dealership closer to my house, I thought about it and let him order the unit I wanted, I took about 3 weeks longer but it was well worth it, Pete did a great job and I actually look forward to buying another car and hopefully its from him, it was well above and beyond",5.0
35,"January 14, 2016","This is our first Hyundai to ever own & I have to say it is one of the best driving cars out there, especially for the price. We went to another Hyundai dealership in San Antonio (Red McCombs) and we were not treated well and were kind of given the run around and salesman didn't know anything about the car he was trying to sell us. But at World Car Hyundai we were treated very professionally and our salesman, Chase was very knowledgeable about the Elantra and answered all of our questions. I would highly recommend this dealership to anyone in San Antonio over the other dealerships.",5.0

37,"September 22, 2015","I only had a problem with one person at this location, but I should not have needed to go the extra 25 miles back and forth 3 times to close this deal.  It should have been done at the North location.  You wasted 3 days of my life and 150 miles.  Abraham was great and he has great customer service skills from the South location.  My first contact was with a man that was extremely nice too.  He saved World car.  I would not have bought from World Car had it not been for him after what happened to me at the North location.  I don't remember his name.",3.8

Thank you again World Car South",5.0
40,"September 07, 2015","Very friendly, non-pushy staff. they actually listen to what you have to say and do not go by some dealer set down sales pitch policy. The only complaint I can say I had was I had to wait a bit for the car to come from make ready, so I didn't check it as good as I should have. I do not know what they used to clean the inside glass, but in the evening a horrible haze appeared on all inside glass, re-cleaned it myself the next morning, took some elbow grease to get off what ever was smeared on, but it is fine now. everyone there that I dealt with or even were just working there where very polite and greeted/acknowledged me My Salesman Abraham Delagarza, was very polite, personable and apologetic about the time that Make ready was taking",4.8
41,"August 27, 2015",Overall they did ultimately I ended up with the car I wanted but i was disappointed with the fact that they still swapped cars on me and for me this basically means I am going to start over and re-test drive and check out the features. My sales guy was great but I sort of felt like they were holding my trade in hostage while I was waiting for them to locate my new car for the second time. Joel and Abraham did give me a great deal on my car and included all features that I was looking for. We will still come back here at the end of the year when we trade in our other Hyundai for a new one.,4.4

47,"July 10, 2015","The previous comment in the survey includes my assessment of the dealership. Some of the managers need to be more professional and courteous to more junior personnel. We loved our salesman, Gerardo ""G"". If it hadn't been for him, I would not have bought the car. ",3.6
48,"July 08, 2015","I got a brand new 2016 Hyundai Elantra at a very good price, the entire process went smoothly and the staff was very nice and knowledgeable ",5.0
49,"June 09, 2015","I went online to review and research my vehicle for purchase on Car Gurus. I called to notify World Car Hyundai Kia that I was interested in the car and that I would be driving from Corpus Christi to San Antonio in regards to purchasing the 2010 Honda Accord Coupe. On Saturday morning when I arrived the car was parked out front. It was neither clean nor detailed and even had a beverage sitting in the cup holder. The sales person said that they did not wash the vehicle because they did not know if I would be purchasing the car? I would think they would have had the car detailed and washed to impress the customer. With all that said we took the car for a test drive. The sales person pointed out that the driver side door had a small cosmetic tear in the leather and that was THE ONLY thing wrong with the car.  Regardless, small issue loved the car. I went back followed up with all necessary paperwork to purchase the vehicle. I then was told it would be 45 min to an hour for them to wash the vehicle. So I waited (something that should have already been done). Finally my vehicle was ready. With excitement my husband and I converted all of our belongings from my previous car to the new car. I looked at the front windshield and saw that where the sticker price had been there was a HUGE crack in the windshield. HUGE. They managed to cover it up with the sticker price to where it was not visible. At this time with papers signed and a fussy toddler we were on our way. My excitement turned to anger when I realized I had been deceived.  The cosmetic tear in the leather on the driverâ€™s side door was the ONLY thing that was revealed. They were immoral to hide the HUGE crack in the windshield and then reveal it once the vehicle was purchased. I find this dealership SHADY and very unprofessional.  Pre owned vehicle or not they should take pride in their sales.  I do not recommend nor will I ever purchase another vehicle from World Car Hyundai Kia.",1.0
50,"April 09, 2014",Yesterday arown the 2:30 pm my boyfrend visit this bilding and never some ane came for help or see if we need somting.  Im tell all my frends and family dont came. Im never recomend this bilding.,1.0
51,"January 16, 2014","This was a simple service call, change the oil and do the normal check everything multipoint inspection. We came in a dropped the car off and went and had a leisurely lunch nearby. By the time we came back, the car was waiting for us, just had to pay - check out. A quick review of what was found and we were out the door. The service here normally goes fairly quick and not too often you need an appointment, but I think that depends a lot on the service you're going in for. Something more major would probably be to your benefit to arrange an appointment.",5.0
