2,"February 09, 2020","My son and I talked to general manager and a service man about a problem we had. Agreement was reached and they took us to the car rental. Our car was taken to the service area a cardboard number put on it.We left in a Ford 150.I soon found out it was hard for me to get into the truck because of being 73 and having a painful hip. Jeff called the rental place and told them about the problem. The man was very nice and said we could switch vehicles. When we drove back into the lot there was a very agitated service man.He told us to get out of the truck get into our car and leave.We of course was very surprised since an hour ago everything was okJefg asked what was going on.He said he didn’t have to tell us anything and we were to leave. Jeff went inside and got the manager. He grabbed the guys arm and told him to calm down. He didn’t . Then he told us he had his manager on the phone.Jefg asked if he could speak to him.He said no he would call us on Monday. Then he went and got our car and told us to leave.I was still in the truck. He said he had already told me twice to get out of the truck.I told him I would as soon as my son could help me down. I am not fond of the dealership right now but I don,t think they would want their customers treated that way.He was rude, unprofessional and inappropriate. He caused us embarrassment because there was other people around the area.They probably thought we stole the truck. If there was a problem we should have been taken to an office and the problem discussed.I can honestly say I have never been treated that bad before.",1.0

4,"December 10, 2019","I would stay from this place of you are looking for a good used truck, or even a new truck. First, I found a truck I wanted to look at online in their inventory, when I emailed about the truck the salesman, who I later found out was the used car managers son, called to inform me the truck had been bought. While I was listening to his voicemail a different salesman called to inform me he had located the truck on the lot and was sitting in it while we were speaking. That should have been my first warning but things happen.a couple days later  I drove over an hour and a half to test drive the vehicle, it was in good shape from all outward appearances and was still under factory warranty. While driving I noticed the back up camera wasn’t working so when we went to the desk I made that known to the assistant manager of used car sales, at least that’s what I was told he was. His response initially was that it would be taken care of, that soon changed to “well, the truck is still under factory warranty so if you take it to them they will take care of it for you”, his words. That should have been the second red flag. At this point I’m tired of looking at trucks so I just let them appraise my trade in. In my conversations with the salesman I had told him I had a written appraisal from a different dealer and I was assured they would beat or match it, no problem there. Their appraisal was 2500 below what I had in writing from the other dealer. At this point I asked for my keys back, the salesman( a different one that the first I had spoken with) was visibly shocked that I was not going to play his games, in fact his response was “why?, that was only the first one”. He informed me the appraiser still had my keys and he would have to go get them. I specifically said to bring me my keys and nothing else, I didn’t want to speak to a manager or anyone else, just bring me my keys. The appraisal manager, at least that what he introduced himself to me as, decided to come out and show me a piece of paper he printed out showing where he got his numbers from. This piece of paper had no official markings or logos from any auctions, firms, or businesses on it, it was literally a piece of paper he typed up and printed out and tried to pass off. After retieiving my keys from him I was headed out the door and ran into the first “manager” I had encountered, he was perplexed as to why I was leaving without buying the truck that they were refusing to fix before being sold. Of this is the kind of service they are giving I will take my business elsewhere, there were plenty of other dealerships willing to take the 40k I had to spend on a truck without making me feel like a I wasn’t worth their time.

6,"October 20, 2019","This was my first time buying a car and they helped me through everything with their great and friendly customer service representatives  They were so helpful and gave me a great deal on the car and extended warranty. I needed a new, reliable car car before I transferred to a new college several miles away from home. They possibly spoiled my future buying experiences because this was just so great, I'm happy I don't have one of those car dealership horror stories everyone seems to have. I will definitely be buying from these guys again in the future! Highly recommend David and Matt!",5.0
7,"September 16, 2019","My husband and me won't go to any other dealership. 3 different times they helped us get into our dream vehicle. This last time they were our light in a storm. My husband had totaled our car when he had a seizure due to a prescription brand change done by the pharmacy. It was hard on us because he wasn't at fualt but now we were stuck with an upside down loan. 

I asked about a 2019 ford flex online. Within a matter of moments Nicole had called and given me hope. We had 9000 We had to roll over. Nicole didn't let that discourage her from helping us out. She was understanding and compassionate. 

She worked along side Matt first trying to go through our bank. They called explaining it was a no go. Our bank was offering a small amount to work with and no GAP. They told me don't stress though. They found a vehicle on another lot that thry got lots of discounts for. Then they tried Ford Financing and got us a deal that worked for us. 

Two days later NICOLE PERSONALLY DELIVERED OUR NEW 2019 FORD FLEX TO OUR DOOR. she apologized for taking so long which made me laugh a today wait is nothing.

In addition MATT called to follow up on paperwork, and offered TO PERSONALLY HELP PERSONALLY HELP ME SETUP MY FORD FINANCING ACCOUNT BEFORE THE PAPERWORK CAME IN. He even offered to help me with the best way to handle the payments.

NICOLE AND MATT WERE OUR LIGHT IN OUR STORM AND HELPED IS MAKE A GOOD START TO GETTING BACK ON TRACK. LEIF JOHNSON IS THE PLACE TO GO FOR CARING SERVICE, WHERE THEY WILL FIGHT TO HELP YOU GET INTO YOUR DREAM VEHICLE.",5.0

He was kind,  very knowledgeable about all vehicles, and was helpful in every step of the purchasing process. Big shout out to financing who are AWESOME aswell.

He made me feel so welcome, like family. I may have only been there for a few hours to buy my car but he made the whole experience great. I will be looking for him in the future for any questions and obviously future purchases. I'll also be sure to recommend him to all of my friends and family or anyone I know of looking for a Ford. I can not stress enough how amazing he was to work with. I left with a new car and a new friend, the experience was truly amazing.

15,"April 24, 2019","I made appointments with two people at the used car lot to look at a specific truck.  I was coming from two hours away, only to find out the truck wasn’t there when I showed up.  The salesman told me another branch picked it up that morning, but I called them and it was sold the day before...The same day I got confirmation about meeting with them about it.  Tried to up sale me on a more expensive truck that was out of my price range and wouldn’t give me a good deal even though they wasted my entire day.  The store is disgusting as well",1.4
16,"April 19, 2019","I was referred to this dealer from a friend so had high hopes, but once I got the process of buying a car, it all went downhill.

I started the process at 10 am with the application, trade-in amount, etc. and it's now 6 pm and still no response.

I talked to one person who told me what to send and what car I wanted then nothing. Tried to call the finance department only to be hung up on and I mean they picked up the phone and hung up like I was bothering them.

I made many calls to the person I was talking to and even got a contact number for another person and left many voicemails only never to get a response.

Someone needs to help this dealership learn what Effective Communication is and how to treat potential customers.

I am taking my businesses elsewhere. Buy hey if you want nothing but frustration be my guest.",1.0

18,"February 04, 2019","Our family has used Leif Johnson Ford (LJF) through 3 generations and we all still committed and loyal to this organization.   I have purchased multiple vehicles from them and most recently purchased my retirement car.  There were a few concerns after I purchased the car however LJF has a history of managing with integrity, setting high performance standards and continuously producing a level of customer service that is first-class.
Gordon, a part of the leadership team, possesses  proficient characteristics of leadership and service delivery/excellence.  He showed professionalism that was exemplary while being completely down to earth.  Gordon was dedicated to doing what was right and was strongly self-motivated to achieve results within a short period of time. 
My sales person, Clifford Hatch, is also a key reason we are 3 generations strong with LJF.  Clifford possesses real practical experience and is viewed in the field of car salesmen as an expert.  He makes a substantial contribution to LJF as every person I have referred to him says that he far exceeds their expectations and leaves with a car.  Clifford loves the car business and performs with a commitment to excellence that is outstanding.  Thank you for taking great care of my father and my children's transportation needs.

19,"February 02, 2019","These guys are crooks.  Don't waste your time going to this dealership.  They advertise lower mileage than what the car actually has and when you bring it to their attention they claim it was a mistake but the car price is still the same.  Then if you take the time to negotiate a deal, they wait until the very end to state they can no longer honor the price you both agreed upon and if you want the vehicle it will be at a  higher price and only if you do financing through them.

Brian Barnett and Dave Christian consulted with my wife and me regarding our desires, and came up with an offering that fit well.  The process went quickly, as well.

23,"December 20, 2018","I bought a used Ford F-150 from Timothy Broadus, December 2018. He is the salesman you want because he is extremely professional, kind, knowledgeable, and patient. Sometimes salesman look at you like a number or dollar sign, but Timothy was like shopping with a friend. He gave his suggestions, and listed to my suggestions and together we found the right truck for me. I am a 30 year old woman and wasn't experienced in buying a vehicle on my own before. But I can confidently say that I feel comfortable now because of Leif Johnson walking me through the process and teaching me how to safely buy a used vehicle.

He went above and beyond anything I was expecting and turned what could have been a disappointing experience into an exceptionally positive one. ""Outstanding"" sums it up. Leif Johnson Ford will be the first place I turn to for Service or Sales and will try their Parts department if the need shall arise.

29,"September 21, 2018","I'm a new car owner of a 2018 Ford EcoSport, and I have to say that the team at Leif Johnson Ford made it quite a magical experience for me. I was driving an older 2007 Honda Pilot, but wanted something more my size (I'm a petite 4'10"" woman) with modern tech features. My sales consultant, Brian Barnett, was extremely helpful and listened to my likes and dislikes about my older vehicle. I explained to him how safety and fuel efficiency is important to me. So he had me get inside a few vehicles to get a feel for them. But once he showed me the EcoSport, it was true love! With the swing door on the back I can easily stand up on the bumper and load my kayak with ease. And don't even get me started about the 8 inch touch screen and the Hands free ApplePlay! I can not be happier with the customer service I received, and can't wait to get my future maintenance done through Ford. Thank you so much for making me feel like family!",5.0

36,"May 28, 2018","  I found a GT500 at one of Leif Johnson used car lots, I had great experience with Thomas over at the Left Johnson new car lot in Austin when I bought my new F150.  Being that Thomas worked at the new car lot, I didn't know if he would be able to work with me on a used car, or if he could recommend a someone from the used car lot.
  Thomas went one step further and had the car brought over to his lot, where I could meet him to look over the car and take it for a test drive.
  Again Thomas has a no pressure sale attitude, answer all my question on the car and the loan. Let me take my time looking it over, and test drive. 
  The biggest issue I had was, there was no trade in, and after buying the car, I two cars to get home. I didnt even have to ask, Thomas offered to drive one of them home for me, and even caught a ride from there truck lot, so I didnt have to deal with the traffic back to his car lot and back home.
  Thomas makes the new or used car buying experience easy, and his willingness to go above and beyond to help his customer is why Leif Johnson will be the only Ford dealer I will every deal with, and why I will always look for Thomas for any new of use car purchase.
  Great experience all around, recommend Thomas every time for anything you need help with. ",5.0

58,"August 29, 2017","Thomas was my salesman, great guy to work with, no pressure salesman, gave me a upfront out the door price , witch was surprising as seeing most dealers want to get you in the door, and see what you trade is, or how much you can afford for a monthly payment before they give you the out the door price.
  I walked into the dealership knowing that the truck I was looking at was the best price around with all the options I wanted.
 One of the things that I really enjoyed was the test drive, Thomas took me on a long route that included the highway and some back roads,  he more interested in letting me see how the truck drove, handle and showing the features that the Platinum had, than rushing me back to make a deal.  
  Thomas went beyond just showing me the price, he took the time to break down, and go over the extras.
  When it come time to discuss the trade in, they didn't low ball me, witch was surprising, they came back with a fair price, and after a little haggling we made the deal. 
 At no time did I ever feel like I was pressured to buy, or during the finance part, I wasn't even pushed for all the extra's, like under coating or extended warrant. Even the Finance Department was a great experience. 
 After the finance was done, Thomas made sure I got with the tech guy to go over all the options the truck had, This is the first time in I ever had this, I always had to get the manual out to find out how things worked.
 My over all experience with Leif Johnson Ford and Thomas was GREAT !!!!! ",5.0
59,"July 06, 2017","Vehicle sold to me had an mechanical issue with the engine.  Took car back with mechanical issue within the first week, was told that the service department did not find any problems.  I was told that the Ford ESP warranty would cover any issues.  The Ford ESP purchased was a joke.  The warranty company wanted me to pay to tear down the engine to diagnose the problem.  Leif Johnson staff lied and said that the car did not come back in the first week and they stated that I never contacted them.  I had contacted them multiple times regarding the issue.  After the vehicle was traded in to another dealer, it took Leif Johnson more than 6 weeks to cancel the Ford warranty. The warranty was cancelled after contacting the dealer 3+ times a week for the 6 weeks.  Avoid Leif Johnson at all costs.  There are more reputable dealers out there who care about the service they provide and customer satisfaction.",1.4

It was a pleasant surprise at the professionalism and helpfulness that James Billington (and Chad Christian) displayed in my recent purchase. They knew everything about the vehicle that I wanted to buy, including the history of the truck and what the market is for similar vehicles. No pressure and come ons. Just straight forward car dealing. They also handled all that could be handled over the phone or email and saved me a ton of time. I appreciate that.",5.0
61,"April 28, 2017","I don't know where to start but I know where we ended up! Extremely happy with the service provided and the SURPRISE delivery of the vehicle to my spouse on the job! Melissa Martin is patient...so patient in fact that she worked with me for 6 MONTHS! Did I mention I have never purchased a NEW car before? That in itself was scary but Melissa reassured me all along the way that she'd be there for me when I was ready. And she was and she checked in now and then. Everything we discussed was via email. Quotes, financing, offers to bring a New Ford Flex by my workplace just to look at it. Who does that?! We didn't even meet in person until about ten days before I took the plunge! She even brought in a used Flex I was finally considering due to cost from another location very south. I liked it but the more I thought about it the price wasn't that much different overall for a new Flex. I also was VERY picky about the colors. I wanted Black, Charcoal cloth interior , and no fancy extra unnecessary items. She brought in what I wanted from a third location and had it waiting a day early for me. The exact colors with 3 extras I actually was thrilled to have; a backup camera we didn't think existed on that particular trim(initially I thought a backup camera was a distraction), roof rails, and a fancy get-back-in-your-vehicle-if-you-lock-your-keys-in-it-thingamadoodle. Oh and paperwork took about 20 minutes at the most. Overall, Melissa was the reason I bought from Leif Johnson Ford. I even sent 2 coworkers to her that were in desperate need of a vehicle months before I purchased the car because I was confident she could help in some way. Melissa is patient, caring, likes some of the weird stuff I like and was in no way surprised that my potential trade-in vehicle was black, had a gray interior, and had a full-sized skeleton in the back seat. And that was another thing. Honesty. She knew my trade wouldn't fetch much and was upfront about that. SO, go to Melissa, at Leif Johnson Ford on Airport. If she doesn't have what you want there, I'm sure she will find a way to get what your looking for. And if she can't, she'll tell you straight up. Thanks again Leif Johnson Ford, but in all sincerity, 99% of that is to Melissa Martin!",5.0

I traded a 2006 Chrysler 300C totally loaded with 77,100 miles and in near perfect shape. We looked at a different Taurus than the one I had inquired - they said it was out for the afternoon. The one they switched me to was the SE, which I had done no research (as opposed to the Limited they had). My salesperson didn't mention that they were only allowing $5,000 for my trade until we were well into the financing of the newer Taurus - the way she stated it, I was confused as to what she meant until I went into the finance managers office where I was stunned by this information. I went ahead with the deal assuming they knew something about the re-sale value of the Chrysler that I didn't. Well, much to my surprise and dismay, less than a week later I see my old Chrysler for sale on their website for $11,400 stating what an incredible car it is and only one owner - they knew I was the second owner just looking at the paperwork I filled out as well as by reviewing the CarFax. When I called to inquire how my $5,000 car had jumped to $11,400, I was told they had put $7,200 into preparing it for resell - PLEASE!!! Total bull - car dealerships send cars to auction that require that kind of reconditioning - plus it's absurd and offensive to insult my intelligence in that manner - they took a $5,000 car, knowingly spent $7,200 on it and have it showing as a special on there website for $11,400 - $5,000+$7,200=$12,200 - so which do you think, they are compulsive liars or just plain stupid? I had also recently had my car appraised for two minor body repairs (scratches and a keying) and new tires, no mechanical work was needed for a maximum of $1,000 to $1,200 and that's with the highest quality tires. The dealership is totally unwilling to try to make things right with this deal so this will be turning into a legal matter tomorrow.

I just wanted to drop a line out here and say that I began my most recent car shopping knowing pretty much exactly what I wanted, what I wanted to pay and how I wanted the deal to go down. I'd heard some Leif Johnson ads on the radio but little else about the dealership until I saw 'THE car' on their website. - I showed up, with a few bad past car buying experiences on my mind and ready to do battle. Only the battle never came. The salesperson, Ms. Stephanie Owens showed up ready to do business and it was a welcome relief. I told her up front, exactly what I wanted, and she said in a very matter of fact way, 'No problem, I'll take it to them and see what we can do.' She came back with an even better deal, a great amount for what was a real piece of junk trade in I had, and in a matter of just a few hours, we were done. I have never had a car purchase or any major purchase for that matter go so smoothly and with zero up-selling or pressure of any kind.

Thomas Almaraz was my salesman and is absolutely the best! He was very helpful throughout the process and always followed up as he said he would. The entire team I worked with from Thomas in sales, to Amanda in finance were all a pleasure to work with.

185,"January 11, 2016","I was looking to trade in my 2013 F150 XLT (also purchased from Leif Johnson) for a Lariat w/Sports Package, and again Leif Johnson came through for me.  They had the exact vehicle I wanted on the lot at the right price.  After signing the paperwork the salesman Leo as well as the General Sales Manager (Jeff) pointed out that the truck had a factory paint defect low on the drivers side door.  They assured me it would be taken care of by their bodyshop and I took delivery of the truck.  After sleeping on it, I didn't feel comfortable with a new truck having a paint repair from day 1 so I returned the vehicle to the dealer and they honored their 7 day money-back guarantee without questions.  They were able to find a replacement vehicle from another dealer about 150 miles away and had it ready to be delivered 2 days later.",5.0
186,"January 10, 2016","Had an issue with my Back-up Camera and Radio cutting out. I had it at another Austin Ford Dealer who could not resolve the issue. Their solution was to pay $5,000 to completely re-wire the entire car??? Brought it to Leif Johnson and Service ADVISOR Frantz Cordio. He spent time to research any possible known issues and all re-calls. We started by performing the re-calls that the other dealership did not advise existed nor did they perform. Both of the re-calls had potential of resolving the issue. They performed the re-calls and the problem has diminished. Now the radio periodically briefly cuts off and then comes back immediately, previously it cut off and did not come back on immediately. Hopefully this will work it's way out and completely resolve the issue. If this doesn't resolve the problem I am certain we will be able to isolate and completely resolve. GREAT to see a dealership and service department that is more concerned about taking a LOGICAL approach to resolving an issue rather than an illogical route to benefit their dealership.

208,"December 18, 2015","The first salesperson was not forthcoming, condescending, and dishonest. I was switched off to another salesperson and the process went  much smoother, HOWEVER, in the transfer, a couple of things happened - the items that were to be added on to my order per the sales manager somehow did not get added on and I ended up paying for them and, most importantly, one of my top important things to have on the car (remote start) got eliminated and in the chaos of the switch, I didn't see it. I'm still disappointed not to be able to get remote start which was something very important to me. I accept responsibility but there were so many things to go through again and I also wish that the salesperson would have been more specific about the things on the original build order and those things that didn't get on the 2nd build in the switch and why.

Second, the website to build is not effective or efficient. It's confusing and could use a lot of work.

Third, I have taken the car back to have some additional features and that was planned for a week or so. When I dropped it off, it sat there all day and night only to find out the item had not arrived which will run the things late and possibly not enable me to pick it up when I need and prolong it being there at the shop as well as all of the plans I have made for rides for drop off, pick up, and needing to be certain places.

I have used this service center for my truck as well and that process did NOT go well either with people having their work being completed much sooner than mine, losing my truck in the lot taking even more time for me to be able to get out of there, and the worst part, I had to return when they didn't do work that was scheduled to have been done.

220,"November 24, 2015","Overall I was pleased with my purchase. I was looking for a very specific vehicle on the Internet for many months. When I found my best choice, I filled out the online form. A very nice sales person, Dee, sent an email the next day and we later made phone contact. I found that they were not willing to deal off of the asking price much at all. In my previous searches, I found that almost all of the vehicles I wanted to buy, regardless of dealership, sold at or just below asking price.
I took a one-way flight into Austin and was met by a driver who took me to the dealership. Dee was fantastic. My only negative was that from what I was told, I would be in and out in less than an hour. However, the vehicle had not been detailed and the mechanic's look over was still in progress. There was a part needed that could not be found and was told I was okay to drive home and could have it fixed under warranty. The trip home resulted in my needing to make an emergency stop at Truck City in Buda, TX, a sister dealership. This service department did a great job although I was there for almost 8 hours. I understood that I got there after their initial morning rush and my repair was very time consuming. The service writer and manager kept me apprised on the details. Someone drove me to get something to eat and everyone made me feel at home as best they could. 
In all, I think mine was a unique problem and would buy from Lief Johnson again. Their seven day money back guarantee gave me time to get home and have my mechanic check out the vehicle knowing that if I did not like what was found, I could bring the vehicle back.",4.2

222,"November 21, 2015","Thought I would give you some feedback about my experience getting my 2012 Ford Escape serviced today.

I had an appointment for an Oil Change and State Inspection.

During the State Inspection, the inspector stated the wiper blades needed to be replaced to be able pass inspection.  Which I was told that would be $25, which is high when the only thing that needed to be replaced was the rubber, not the wiper blade assembly.  I couldn't leave and replace the wipers blades myself, because I would have had to pay for second inspection. Then we I went to pay they state they missed priced and said it was now $39 for wiper blades.  After I complained the Service Representative took the ""Labor"" fee off, which we know it only takes less then 30 seconds to replace.

In addition the Service Representative pushed a hard sell for the following things that should be done; 1. Coolant Flush 2. Plug Replacements 3. 4-cylinder tune up 4. brake line fluid replacement.

I asked if these were required for State Inspection or affect the performance of the vehicle, which he responded no, it's just ""preventative maintenance"".


Then I witness another Service Representative do the hard sell to another woman waiting for just her oil change.

Do you do the same practice to men, or just pry on female customers?

When the seats were finished she called me at work and told me to pick up the truck prior to 8pm. She knew that I worked until 8pm and she picked up the truck that morning from my work. No common sense. They finally had some guys drop it off. When I explained to him and showed him the promise note of what was suppose to be done he called the sales rep. She and her manager got very nasty on the phone with me and said they were not keeping their promise because heated/cooled seats are a factory item. Well, how am I suppose to know that and why did they sign a promissory note? They also left black duct tape all over my truck. I plan on giving that promise note to an attorney. I would never shop at this location ever again",1.0
247,"September 04, 2015","I am a long time loyal customer and have purchased four vehicles from LJF. 
Since 2004, I have only had two (5-Star rated) Service Advisors (SA), until this recent trip of oil changes.  
Monday, I met my new SA and he was very nice and seemed to be on top of his game. 
On Thursday, I brought our second vehicle in to have an oil change, to check a differential oil leak, 
and repair a broken driver seat issue (still under warranty).
 
I knew it was going to take time, so I chose to rent a car and go back to work. At 3:00 p.m., I called 
to get the status of my vehicle. I found out that my SA had left for the day; but was told that 
the vehicle was done and ready. I drove to the dealership, went to the Casher to pay and get my vehicle. 
They told me that they had no record of my vehicle. After waiting a good amount of time, I spoke with John,
the Service Manager. He did a good job in personally solving the issue. Kudos to John that day.
 
After close to an hour of waiting, with a Porter looking around for my paperwork and John getting involved; 
my paperwork and keys were buried on the desk of my new SA. NOT GOOD! 
This shows me that the SA doesn't follow through with the work that he starts. 
As a professional, I assumed that there would be a spot for inprogress work;especailly if it is known the customer would be
back that day to pick up the car. To ensure that my clients have a positive customer experience (5 Star) that 
LJF follows through with their service from start to finish. 

Finally my vehicle is brought up. I transfer my items from the rental back to my vehicle. It is just before rush hour, and I want
to get on the way home. I did not notice all the grease stains on the door jam, floor mats, steering 
wheel, and seat. Once I did notice, I was really ready to just let this experience go by and hope that the next one was 
better. However, the next morning my wife comes to me irate. After having the vehicle detailed earlier that week, it was now covered in grease. 

Two things that would have solved these issues would have been: 1) taking the time to place a paper mat on my floorboard
and 2) offering a little more customer attention from my SA. 

A phone call goes a long way. At the end of the day knowing my SA has open tickets, 
calling the customer to let them know that their work is still pending and that it was turned over the WO to an associate; is 5 star CS.

The sad thing is that I met the tech that was working on my vehicle and had a great conversation about the issue with him. 
I felt that I was in good hands and felt safe with work he was doing on the vehicle that carries my family. Now I just 
wish he would have taken just a little more time to place a paper floor mat in my vehicle, wash his hands before driving it, 
and just looking out to return the vehicle in the condition that he received it in.

I have to say that over the years, the quality of work and customer experience has kept us coming back for over 10 years. 
However, if this is the new CE, that we are expected to receive from now on, we will start looking for a new dealership. 
You are welcome to contact me for more details about my experience with Thursday's service.

UPDATE 

Since my review, I have met with several managers of LJF to discuss my experience and issues. Each and every one of them was very sincere to fix the problem and keep me as a happy loyal customer. We determined where the breakdown was and I feel that myself, or no one else after me will not have the same experience like I had. LJF did go above and beyond to right the wrong and I feel that if I ever have another issue that I have not only a name but a friend that I can contact to resolve any issue.  I have returned several times to have standard maintenance done to all of our vehicles and have had nothing but great customer service. ",2.8

The car met my expectations and I was glad to be able to take an extensive ""test drive"" after purchase during the 7 day grace period.
My salesman Craig was courteous and reasonable throughout. He even drove me across town the next day to get the keys to my rental that I had stupidly forgotten. 
If there is a caveat, they will try to upsell you on the LoJack theft recovery system. With the $200 discount, it was worth it to me. But do your own research.

258,"August 02, 2015","I have purchased roughly 8 vehicles over the last twenty years, and my recent purchase from Leif Johnson tops them all in terms of ease, fair pricing, absolutely no hassling,  and customer treatment. In fact, it was so easy it seemed suspicious (always waiting for the twist or trick)! But none came. I worked with Wesley Staton for the new vehicle (Ford F150 XLT). 

I had been wanting a truck for a while, and the summer rebates were looking good on all the major manufacturers. But I soon found out my current vehicle had depreciated much faster than anticipated, and I would be upside down on it  going into the deal. I had decided I would hold off for another year in order to not roll up any negative equity into a new car. Wesley then contacted me to see if I was still interested, and I kindly responded that I was not in the market due to my current vehicle. He came back with a rough trade-in estimate outright that was much better than anyone had offered previously (including other sellers selling the same truck). By that time I had done much of my research and gave him the numbers I was interested in seeing. He instantly made it happen. No haggling, no countering. I arrived at 6pm on a Friday afternoon, and was driving home the new truck by 8:30pm. Besides offering up a deal I couldn't refuse, Wesley also demonstrated much more useful knowledge of the truck that most other salesperson I have encountered.

259,"July 31, 2015","I got a wild hair and decided to check the market to see if I could move from my existing 2013 Super Crew Lariat into a current year model. I pinged the web and was instantly flooded with multiple dealer quotes offering $2000 to $10000 off the list price. For those dealers in the mid to low range, I didn't hesitate to let them know they weren't in the game, LJ was included.
My demands were pretty straight forward, monthly payment at or below my current with a new term @60 months with no money down. I had equity in my trade-in.
After several days of ridiculous offers well above my terms and some notable close calls Leif Johnson returned to the table with an offer that knocked the competition out. Not only did they compete, they exceeded my terms with an offer that could not be ignored!
Melanie contacted me with the details of the terms, showed me several trucks and once the candidate was selected sent me right over to Finance to seal the deal. 
Both Melanie and Amanda in finance were true to their word, the deal came in as expected. No curve balls or last second ""gotchas"". I was truly amazed!
This makes my third deal with Leif Johnson to date, they are truly the best!

I found out there  had been a recall in March so I've missed that deadline.  I called the dealership in tears to let them know what was going on and was told there was nothing they could do for me. Even though I haven't had the car long they wouldn't even give the courtesy of helping with a rental car.

283,"May 11, 2015","I do not recommend any Leif Johnson Location - well at the very least not the Leif Johnson Superstore North (Austin, TX). Eric Smith and Mary Stacey are both crooked and I will tell you why.
I made a purchase there last month, they firstly attempted to justify giving $3,500 less than the Kelly Blue Book suggested saying, ""this is what the book value is, $12,000 is all your car is worth"". It is interesting to me that I got a whole lot more than that for it else where!! 
Then I went to purchase a used vehicle without trading in my own vehicle from them that same day. Eric Smith, an employee there, took over the sale instead of the newbie salesman that had been helping us and it went like this:
The web advertised price was $28,634 and I confirmed this before leaving for their location 120 miles away form our home. Once I accepted to take the vehicle, Eric tried to list out the warranty and total costs on a paper which reflected the sales price of the vehicle to be $28,999. I caught this change and said I would not accept this amount as it was not what was advertised or marketed to me. He tried to pull a fast one by saying, ""Oh the difference is the LoJack system we install on all our cars and it can't be uninstalled, it has a $500 value and you will get this back in insurance savings"" (our insurance does not offer any such thing BTW). I told him to either remove it or change the price or I was leaving without the vehicle. He 'changed' the price to $28,799 but still didn't change it to the advertised price. I reckon he thought I didn't catch on but i did and didn't say anything just to see if he would pull it off.

I have had my truck almost a week now, and it is a nice ride. I would definitely say there is no gimmick or smoke and mirror tactics during my experience. Just honest car sale and easy process. I would say if you are going to buy a car, shop more than a week, price everything with features you want, and be ready with internet sales numbers, your insurance costs, and you will probably walk away happy with your new purchase.

305,"February 14, 2015","The last three vehicles I have purchased were from Leif Johnson dealerships and for good reason.  They have a large selection of vehicles that can be seen conveniently from their website www.iwanttobuyused.com .  The prices have always been fair compared to book/market values, the sales staff is always friendly and works hard to please their customers, and the great service does not stop at the sale.  They work hard to make sure you are happy with your purchase, and in the event problems arise after the sale they will work with you to get them resolved.  I shop around for the best deal I can find when searching for my next vehicle, and the last three times that has led me to a Leif Johnson dealership.  My first vehicle was purchased from Riata Ford, the second from Truck City, and the last one from the Superstore South location.  Carlos Cornelio was the salesman I worked with on my last purchase, and Travis Hall was the Sales Manager.  They both worked hard after the sale to help get an issue resolved with the car I purchased.  Not only did Carlos and Travis work hard to help me, but they also utilized the expertise of the staff at their other locations to help me as well.  I worked with Matt Schaefer who is the service manager at the Koenig location, J.D. Brooks who is one of the service advisors at Riata Ford, and Oscar who was the technician that fixed my car.  Talk about teamwork!  Three dealerships came together to help fix my used car that I purchased without a warranty.  Why?  Because they genuinely care about the customer, and they operate their business in an ethical manner.  You can't go wrong when you buy from Leif Johnson.   I have become a loyal customer, because they have earned my trust, respect, and my business. Shop with confidence!",5.0

312,"January 30, 2015","I've purchased used vehicles from dealerships before and this was a surprisingly strange experience. It was more like dealing with a little guy that sells cars from the alley behind his house. From the beginning when we entered the shabby lobby I was uncomfortable. It was not as clean as I'd expect a used car office. We were not greeted and pretty much ignored. I was surprised that the car wasn't all cleaned and gleaming. It turned out to have old tires on it which no one had even taken the time to clean up. The tires turned out to be in the green range, just barely. They had some kind of knock off vehicle background check, not a car Fax. They didn't tell us about the extended warranty, although I was not really keen on buying anything extra they might offer anyway. The salesman told me he would put caps on the tire valves, but didn't. You might expect that at a fly by night place, but I was surprise it happened here. Then they didn't give us a copy of all the paperwork we signed.

Lief Johnson Ford offers a very good, you-can-return-this-car-if-you-don't-like-it-within-7 -days-promise, but they didn't give us the paperwork we signed on this. I called our closer who told me they really didn't give the paper work out and suggested I talk to my salesman. Another salesman called me back and said they didn't give this paperwork to people. It was just for them. I complained about this and received my copy.

After purchasing the vehicle, we took it immediately to the Toyota dealership and had it completely checked out. We also purchased our own carfax report, which had info on it that the other report didn't,. And we had the tires checked out. The tires had to be rotated because of road noise, and they were at the edge of good, but still good.

My advise would be to go to this dealership after purchasing your own carfax on the vehicle. Bring a mechanic to check on the car before buying it or go immediately to another dealership and have the car checked out to make sure there are no unseen defects. Insist upon getting a copy of the money back guaranty paperwork that you sign. And returning the car within 7 days if it doesn't  work as expected or has problems revealed by another service department. 

You do get your first oil change free, but don't expect to leave with a full tank of gas. I would be reluctant to return to this dealership, but if the car seemed to fit my parameters, I would go prepared to have a strange-almost-buying-from-the-back-of-a-dealer's-home-garage kind of experience.

I got a phone call immediately and was at the dealership by 5:20 and driving the car. After a quick appraisal of my trade (for which LJF gave me $1300 more than Carmax), it was time to start the paperwork. Michael Fernandes was attentive, friendly and made the process quick, easy and even fun. Ryan Fisher in the finance department was great, too. I came in pre-approved with a really low interest rate, and these guys beat it. I was impressed. I got exactly what I wanted in the Escape, more than I was expecting for my trade, a better interest rate than I walked in with, and my payments were EXACTLY what I wanted them to be.

They even stayed with me right up to closing hours. They were able to do this in a way that was neither overbearingly pushy nor smug.

I test drove several vehicles and noted problems with all of them - which the salesman didn't mention to begin with.  Obvious problems.  So they're willing to sell you used vehicles with problems, without mentioning the problems, that people who are less mechanically minded might miss.  Salesman suggested only a short test drive, not nearly long enough to actually notice whether you even like the vehicle or not, nor if it has a host of other problems.  Might as well buy from a private seller - price is going to be lower and they're probably not going to try to use idiotic stage hypnosis techniques on you.  

Buying from here new might be fine but run, don't walk away from the used lot.  I was inside other dealerships and none of them had the creep factor this one did.",1.5

Gary answered all my questions and had the lowest price on the truck I was looking for . I checked with nine dealers in Houston-Crosby-Tomball-Austin area and Leif Johnson was best .

A test drive confirmed our interest and the sales office visit went well, albeit a little slowly. We agreed to terms, but spent 3 hours waiting for the paperwork and the truck to be prepped.  All in all, about a 5 hour visit, much longer than we expected.  Joe was friendly and professional, but we would have appreciated more regular status updates on the delays in prep time.",4.2

He gave me some very informative information that allowed me to do more specific research.  I got back in touch after I had finished my research.  We formed the outline of a deal with the options I wanted over the phone.  This was very easy and efficient and allowed me to fit the car buying experience around my life. 

I came in and worked with Ross on the specific deal for the specific car.  We worked from the outline of the deal and it was completed to the final deal with ease, efficiency, good humor and fun.  Ross enjoys what he does and it shows. Ross was also very accommodating around my schedule and kept me informed every step of the way.  

Amanda in the finance office was a great one!  She too made the process easy and efficient and did so with good humor.

I got the car I wanted and a fair deal .  This was my second purchase from Leif and I will be back in the future.

It was only  after hours in a competitors office trying to get the best  deal did I go to Leif Johnson.  So I went to the other dealer (not Leif) and tried to trade in a vehicle for a brand new F250.  There was some complications on the trade in so, I asked for pricing of the new F250.  The came down on the price but I wanted to shop around to make certain I got the best deal.  I contacted the main number at Leif and spoke to Ross Brown.  Ross called me back and we discussed another price for the exact same truck as the competitor.  I exlained to Ross that I was tired and did not want to wheel and deal all day.  This was his sign to hurry up with the best deal.  Ross did excactly what he said he would do.  Leif beat the competitors out the door price by a large margin.  Kinda still in shock about that one.  Ross made this deal over the phone practically and with a fraction of the time of the other place.  Leif Johnson has a great sales person in Ross, but it was also by Misty the parts lady who I didnt feel forced to buy anything from and was very informative.  Because of her, I will be back to upgrade.  Shannon in finance very friendly and professional.  

This relationship all started because of a good salesman(Ross Brown) who cared about customers request and listened before the deal was final.  He is a great asset.

Waited for a week and a half, had not heard anything. Made several phone calls, was promised my call when would be returned in 10 min, or 20 min etc, NEVER received a return phone call, not one. Upon calling back, I wanted someone new so we started working with Gordon. Turns out our car with the $500 deposit had been sold. So looking onward, our color choices were red, black or white. He said he had a red one, quoted me a price. I called a couple other dealerships and his quote was the lowest. We show up to test drive it, it is purple, not red. This doesnt matter too much, but it does rub you the wrong way to be lied to, however small. So we end up having to fill the same paper work out again, and then they try to sell it at over $1000 what I was quoted on the phone. Will takes it back to his manager Gordon who says the lowest he can go it so-and-so which is STILL over what I was quoted on the phone. I tell Will I want to speak directly to Gordon because he has lied to me. Gordon comes in and tells me that I am wrong. Flat out. That I was mistaking on the quote since I had been talking to several dealerships. He mentioned several times that I was wrong, that he was right, theres no way he makes mistakes, and on and on and on about this... but that he would give me the price I was asking for. Ok Gordon, Ill be the bigger person and go ahead and let you believe you to get this over with. So ends up they wont take our form of payment, so we tell Will and Savannah that we will be back at 9AM to finish up. We show up at 9AM and Gordon acts very surprised that we are there, and says he thought we werent coming til after noon, and says give him 10 min. We wait in the waiting room for an hour, with our 2 year old son who does not wait patiently. After we finish up (by the way Savannah was excellent, she did sell us a protection plan that I feel was over priced, but that was my fault for not researching other options ahead of time. But other than that she was very professional and helpful) but anyway so she asks us if theres any reason we wouldnt leave them a good review, and I say well we havent had a very pleasant experience. So she says shes going to get her manager and see what they could do to make it up to us. Gordon walks in. He doesnt offer us anything at all, instead he just goes on and on again about how I was mistaking and how he gave me the price I wanted even though he knows I was mistaking and that he knows he was right. How does that make it up to me for my bad experience? He didnt offer me a thing except another lecture about how hes never wrong.

Randy Filippuzzi met me in the service area, noted the issue, and let me know he was on top of the issue.  Luckily for me, I had a Ford Extended Service Plan to cover mechanical issues on the car so I was not terribly concerned at the time.  I later received a call from Randy letting me know that they found the problem with the a/c, but there was also apparently an issue with the Ford service plan warranty coverage.  My heart immediately sank.  Randy and I discussed the issue, but since I was busy I told him I would simply try to come down to Leif Johnson that afternoon so we could take care of the situation.  

About 15-20 minutes later, Randy called me back to let me know that he and his supervisor called Ford directly to clear up the issue and get the repair back on track.  No further action was needed from me.  I cannot express how outstanding it is when someone takes ownership of a situation, and jumps in to make things right.  In this day and age, there are so many places that have lost sight of true customer service.  You know...the kind that you would give your close friends or family if they were coming to you.  Randy not only demonstrated to me that he and the Leif Johnson service team know what true service is, but by looking at the ""compliment wall"" in the service area, he has done the same for a number of other people.  It is a shame their stories are not on this board, as there are a few that are quite noteworthy, such as a situation in which Randy personally drove to a customer who was having car trouble at a local restaurant to help them out.  

If you are looking for a trustworthy dealership to bring your vehicle to, do not hesitate to bring your car to Randy at Leif Johnson.

417,"May 01, 2013","After hearing about so many bad experiences people have had when buying cars at dealerships, I was truly afraid about what might go down at Leif Johnson Ford. To ease my fear I started online first and asked for a quote for a new Ford Fusion. One of the sales representatives, Wesley Staton, emailed me back rather quickly with great quotes. He even called to see if he could help me with anything else. When we talked on the phone, he wasn't pushy at all. I asked him a few questions about the car and he gave me straight answers which definitely eased my fear. 
Because of his friendliness, I definitely felt more comfortable going into the dealership. After doing my homework I went in knowing exactly what I wanted, and Wesley just listened and brought me what I wanted. He was very informative and helpful about what this car came with. 
When it came time to start the purchasing process, he was even more helpful. He tried to find the best deal for me with the incentives that were available with Ford, and found the best rates for my car loan. When Mr. Staton would leave for a bit and check on other parts of the buying process, other representatives from the Dealership would come by and just say hello and say thank you for coming in.  
If you are looking to buy a new Ford vehicle, I would definitely keep Leif Johnson first on your list. They have a great selection (much better than neighboring Ford dealerships) and the people working there are very friendly. If you are still iffy about the process, just try and look for Wesley Staton, one of the sales reps, and I know he will take care of you.

After being jerked around by used-car dealerships, I decided to look at what my budget would get me new, and found a base-model Fiesta in my price range. We negotiated that price by email, and were ready to roll when I arrived at the dealership. The test-drive felt more like a formality; I walked in 99% sure I was ready to buy. I had outside financing; he asked if they could give me a quote, I refused, and he didn't press the issue. Ditto for my trade-in (although I sort of wish I'd taken it; my old car is in the parking lot as we speak, unsold). 

Shea really went the extra mile to get me to take delivery the same night; I was planning on signing the paperwork, paying the down payment, and picking the car up the next day, but he actually gave me a hand dropping off my old car (at my girlfriend's house a few blocks away).

I gave her a fair but thoughtful answer. She went once to someone to clear it. Then came back with a counter near the offer and we had a deal. They got us out the door quickly so we could make dinner plans that evening.

The rest of the staff were all very friendly and helpful. Peter gave me an hour+ tutorial to help me understand even more about how to get the most out of my car. He quickly figured out my tech understanding and adjusted his lesson on the fly to meet me where I was.

Katie in finance was friendly and orderly. She didn't play games or put too much pressure on me to buy this or that add on. As has been my experience at the close of the sale in the past.

I went to the other certified dealership prior to going to Leif Johnson.  I felt that I being pressured in this dealership and that I was not getting a fair deal for my trade in.  While I was at this other dealership, Dave Christian from Leif Johnson called me again and told me that he would beat any deal offered to me from this other dealership.

459,"December 10, 2012","In looking at Vehicles I had done weeks of homework and new exactly where a vehicle should be priced. They had one that was priced high but fit what we wanted. In negotiations they came down a little but wouldn't budge after that. I was able to negotiate up the price they quote in my trade in to make up the difference. So don't expect to deal to much with them. Of course they tried telling me they were only making $100 on the truck which I know is not the case.

Problems came in after sitting there for 2 hours while they did paperwork and finished everything up. After that I determined they did not have the door code and I had to argue with 5 people for over 2 hours while many people came out to try and figure out the code, or looked up on the internet how to determine the code. This is where they got very short and snooty to us. It got to the point where I researched it and told them their service department could find the code in 5 minutes by hooking it up to the computer. They said they would be charged $75 to do that and I would be sitting there for 2 hours. I don't care, I just bought a car from you , you can eat the $75 ( later found out it was $30 to them) and get me the code to my car. I had to hear about how these charges add up to them and they are not responsible for that. After arguing with multiple people and threatening to back out of the deal they gave me a paper saying it was free. Took it over and was done within 15 minutes.

I was also promised the books to the vehicle and the floor mats. This has never happened and now I am being avoided when I call. No email responses and oddly enough no one can take my calls anymore. Funny how they jump on your calls when you're looking at buying. I even asked in an email that if they were not able to do either to just let me know. Any response is better than being avoided.

I feel like I got a good vehicle at a good price but cannot believe anything that is told to you and they will not do anything extra for you. Like they say, if it's not in writing you're not getting it!!

There were two areas we were not pleased with. after katie offered us an extended warranty policy and we refused,another salesman came in to put the hard sell on us.We did not like that at all.The second srea of disafaction was with the parts department. I bought a cargo mat and thought at thetime it was overpriced.I went to the Leif Johnson web site and indeed it was $90.00 there and I was charged $117.00+ tax.The lady who explained the sync system and programed our phones was very helpful.",4.5
462,"November 29, 2012","I just bought a very nice VW CC 2012from Leif Johnson North,. I had a wonderful experience, everyone was nice, friendly, helpful and Robert went on and beyond to get me a great deal, and a loan that would fit my needs. The whole process was easy, he tried to get the best price for my trade in, and honored the price that was posted on the internet previously on the sedan I bought.  I would highly recommend Leif Johnson North. ",4.8
463,"November 28, 2012","Historically, I have drug myself away from car dealerships, exhausted from battle, attempting to purge the oily “salesmen” miasma from my skin. My recent purchase from Leif Johnson Ford was a startling and pleasant contrast. I was not set upon by a horde of slavering salesmen the second my foot touched their lot, no clumsy attempts to “qualify” me had to be endured (if you don’t know, this has nothing to do with financing, but is a term for the distasteful sales tactics that result in questions like “How does that sound? What would it take to send you home with “x” today? Etc. All designed to convince you that you absolutely must buy something you don’t want or can’t afford). I simply walked in, asked to look at the F-350 I had found on the web, was shown it, had questions answered, took it for a test drive and purchased it. It was refreshing to not be qualified, re-directed to what the salesperson felt I “really wanted” (which would inevitably be more expensive, result in a higher commission and be what they “really wanted”). It is possible that my arrival shortly before close found the usual get of oily, smarmy salesgoons already gone or too exhausted to attack, but Savannah Goodman’s demeanor leads me to believe that not the case. Savannah patiently assisted me with my overabundance of questions, provided me a number of cost comparisons and independent value assessments and generally made me feel that while the dealership was obviously not selling the vehicle at a loss, their profit was reasonable, not gouging. Her open smile, quick wit and ready laugh made her a pleasure to deal with, as were all involved in the sale. I would return to Leif Johnson if I were considering another vehicle, which is more than I can say of any of the dealerships I have suffered through in the past!",4.8
464,"November 27, 2012","First of all, our salesman Jake was the only good thing about our buying experience.  He was very friendly.  That said, overall it was bad.  We began with the initial salesperson Amanda leaving the dealership before our arrival.  She was supposed to be locating a vehicle for us and knew we were coming.  After that, another salesperson, never told us his name, could not find the vehicle we were asking about.  We left.  The next day, Jake found the vehicle (in the front row) they could not locate the day before.  We made the deal.  It took almost 3 hours to get the paperwork ready and this was a cash deal.  I have never waited so long to complete a purchase.  I will not go into details but we should have executed the 7 day return policy for our vehicle.  Has been nothing but trouble.  Should have known the price was too good to be true.",2.8

Other dealers don't have the attention to detail and service-oriented mentaility that this dealership has. Tom and Jeff make sure that we not only get what we are looking for (they went all the way to Oklahoma to find the exact vehicle we were looking for) but also make sure that we secured the best financing with no pressure to pad their bottom line with fluffy add ons that other dealers guilt-trip you into buying.

479,"October 18, 2012","We went in to purchase a 2012 F-150 and my husband told the salesman, Travis, that he had a vehicle to trade in, we'd had it appraised by CarMax, would they be willing to match the appraisal.  They examined his vehicle, took the CarMax appraisal document out of our glove box, examined it, and left it on the seat of the car.  We went in, checkbook in hand, ready to pay the full asking price of the truck and then all of a sudden Travis comes back in with a manager who says they can't honor the trade in agreement discussed, and proceeds to offer us $1000 less and then refers to my husband as ""boss"", which frankly I found unprofessional (we are conducting a business deal, not tapping a keg at the frat house) and obviously we walked out.

The next day, I called and asked to speak to the sales manager, spoke with Gordon, explained the negative experience that had lead us to walking out on the deal.  Gordon stated he would look into it and that he was the kind of person that would call me back.  Great, I thought, maybe we just had an isolated incident.  Then that manager from the night we tried to buy the truck calls my husband, offers him $500 more on the trade in (still not the original amount agreed upon) so I felt like this added insult to injury.  

Gordon did call me back, explained that the CarMax appraisal was too old for them to honor.  I in turn explained that the appraisal date was clearly written on the document they examined and frankly it wasn't my problem.  He did apologize for the way we were spoken to by the sales manager.  He asked if we'd bought a truck yet, I explained no, my husband and I had been down with a stomach bug so we weren't able to get out and shop.  He said would we be interested in discussing if he reworked some numbers, I said fine, but we weren't going to discuss it that day because my husband was still home from work sick.  He left it as he would call me back the next day to discuss, I said fine, and I promptly never heard from him again.  

Save yourself the aggrivation and just pay more to go somewhere that appreciates you spending your hard earned money with them.  Keeping their word regardless of their own mistake, addressing the customer respectfully, and keeping their word to return calls are all ways they could have done better by us.  They could have made an easy sale by abiding by some basic rules of customer service and they blew it.",1.8

The salesmen are rude, they yell at you over the phone they don't give a xxxx about helping you they only care about making money.You are placed on HOLD for a long period of time while they are in the background laughing etc. I Spoke with Therman, Thomas and Chuck one of the managers in the used car department. I called over and over about my license plates after a week of being lied too I went to the Used department and I was so pissed off  i spoke with some Foreign guy he was like ma'am your plates are in the mail and they should be at your home in a couple of days. I tried to give them a chance so i told the guy okay we will see if not i will be back. SMH. The plates were not in the mail, so at that point i called the Manager Chuck he was no help AT ALL he was like ma'am they should of been sent out but they weren't he didn't apologize or anything for my inconvenience. I asked Chuck what address did they have on file for me he told me the address and they messed up on my address when they put my information in the system my apartment number wasn't on the paper work so i was like you know what Chuck y'all can have this car back its not worth the trouble. He told me the plates will come back to their address in two days they never did. I didn't receive my plates for 3 months. When usually it only takes 15-30days if that to get plates in the mail. Also their Service Department employees are rude as xxxx i was waiting for a oil change for 3 hours poor xxx service and i arrived at the place when they 1st opened. So i went to Volkswagen and got an inspection for free with another oil change.

510,"July 23, 2012","I am fill compelled to write this message pertaining to the experience that had at Leif Johnson Ford in Austin, Tx.

As a result of several website researches that I had conducted, I was contacted by a sales representative named Dave Christian via email.  We spoke back and forth for just over a month.  During our conversations, he requested information on the specifications and options for the Mustang which I was interested in.  I truly felt that our correspondence was not aggressive on Dave’s part.

While communicating with him, I also continued to shop for a Mustang and pricing in my local area as well as in San Antonio during a business trip.  I gave up the option to sale my 2011 F150 Ecoboost Truck (Fully Loaded) and sought to trade the vehicle in.  While doing so, I found that other dealers were less than honest when it came to providing me with a respectable price for my vehicle.  The services provided by Automax, located near Fort Hood is the same as most run of the mill Car Sales establishments that I regretfully have been accustomed to dealing with.  My experience was no better when I dealt with a dealer in San Antonio who not only insulted me with my trade in value but also stated firm price rates for their vehicles. 

Dave Christian, representing Leif Johnson Ford, represented my needs by seeking a vehicle that closely resembled the options that I wanted.  Additionally, he provided me with a very respectable price quote for the Mustang.  Dave sent me the pictures, specifications and VIN number to ensure that neither of our time was wasted.  Because of our distance from one another, Dave provided me with preliminary quote for my F150 based on the pictures and specs that I provided.  

As a result, I made travel arrangements and had my vehicle officially inspected and auctioned to several interested dealers for the best pricing.  Based on the current rebates that were ongoing for the new 2012 F150 (which reduced the value of my F150), I was very satisfied with the trade in value that I received.  

Hands down, this has have to be the best car buying experience which I have in my 20 years of purchasing 7 new vehicles.  I numbers game hassles such as “what are you expecting your monthly payments to be” was not used.  As a result of my previous experiences, I have always prepared myself to battle with dealers and Sale Representatives for honest pricing - this was not the case.  Dave Christian actually had power!  None of this, back and forth to the Sales Manager only to return with no positive results.  

Usually, I do not place dealer emblems on my car (labels or license plates) as a personal preference.  However, I have felt very proud to show everyone where I have purchased this vehicle to show all that there honest Dealerships such as Leif Fort and Professional Sales Representatives like Dave Christian out there.

516,"July 13, 2012","I looked long and hard for the vehicle I wanted, to include numerous dealerships and over the internet, and found it at Leif Johson Ford.  It was a no hassle experience from the beginning.  Dave Christian gave me a great price via email on the truck I wanted and even though it was over an hours' drive it was worth it.  I was impressed with the fact that as soon as they looked at my trade in vehicle they gave me my keys back instead of holding them hostage, and I never felt high pressured.  If you want to make buying a new vehicle fun again, go to Leif Johnson Ford.

517,"July 12, 2012","In my line of work I (sales) have to buy a new vehicle about every two to three years and always dread it each time I start the process, but the last two times I have purchased I have had a great experience.
 I really like using the internet to look at what the inventories are at each dealership and also compare what I call “start off prices”. After sorting through a dozen deferent Ford dealerships sites I narrowed the search between two dealerships, one of which was Leif Johnson Ford in Austin Texas. By simply making a call I was able to have them pull out two Trucks that met the criteria of the options I needed and they had them both sitting at the front of the dealership when I arrived. My salesperson (Jeff Colglazier) was very pleasant to work with. I have own over eight F-250 trucks over the last 25 years and normally don’t test drive them because there is not much difference between models from one to the next “WRONG”. These new F-250’s have more gadgets on them than Apollo 13 did. Being kind of an old country boy I was glad that they didn’t just toss me the keys and send me on the way. They took the time to go over all the buttons, switches and knobs, something they call “Sync Technology tutorial”. I’m pretty sure I could have driven the thing off the lot without the tutorial but would have had to call my kids over to give me the skinny on what all these things do and how they work. They even offer “Sync School” after you own the truck for us slow learners? 

All in all I had a great experience and would recommend Leif Johnson Ford and Jeff Colglazier to anyone that is looking for a new vehicle.

I was able to see how it handled, get a feel for how it accelerated and braked, and even how it drove on the highway. We cranked up the A/C and the radio and chatted about the vehicle along the way. Back at the dealership, he eagerly helped me start an application. Price was no-haggle, but was a couple thousand cheaper than what other vehicles of this make were being sold for, so I was happy.

The only thing against it was that it was a used truck. It looked flawless in the pics so I sent an inquiry. Dee Yeo responded sending me the warranty history and car fax on the vehicle. The price was a good deal less than buying new so I sent her pics of my trade. She sent back an offer on my trade that was $2,000 more than I had estimated. The next day I made the 4 hour trip to Austin. The truck was ready to go and I was out the door in under two hours with a payment substantially lower than I was budgeting.

Leif Johnson has a 7-day money back policy (not well publicized, but referenced on this facebook page:  http://www.facebook.co... ) that amounts to a 7-day price match for Internet shoppers willing to return the car in mint condition if they find an attractive better deal. After I did a deal with them, they price matched a late-arriving better quote from another local dealer-- I also dropped the extended service plan I had previously purchased after reading the standard warranty book and discovering that all unique hybrid components (including NiMH battery and CVT transmission) already had a 8 year/100K mile warranty from Ford!

If you are willing to do the research, their 7-day return policy effectively amounts to a price match policy for the new car and model you want. Hard to beat. During the purchase process, they gave me a flyer with the policy on it-- you probably want to double check that it is still in effect.

I had talked to their online sales manager and he arranged so that the  cars I was interested in test driving were lined up and ready to go prior to arrival.  The salesman, Chris Tropiano, was knowledgeable about all of them and was able to answer specific questions on each of the ones I drove.  When I indicated a preference for one of the cars, Chris and LJ's financing department worked out several different scenarios regarding payment for comparison.  Their was a little back and forth on the final sticker price but it never felt like a hassle and their wasn't any of the typical run-around that I had experienced at some of my other stops and I felt that they were honestly interested in arriving at a price that I was comfortable with.  When they said ""we can't get any lower on this car"", I think they were being rather genuine and upfront.

To be fair, this was my first new car buying experience, but I can't imagine it would have gone this well at any other Ford dealership in town. Highly recommended.",5.0
578,"November 26, 2011","First experience in buying a car through the internet.  Got multiple proposals from several dealerships - Leif Johnson's was the best.  Went to look at the car, test drove it and bought it.  Dave Christian was very helpful, honest and diligent in looking for exactly what I wanted.  Finance department was helpful in finding a great APR for me. Easiest car-buying experience I've had.",5.0
579,"November 14, 2011","This is my first experience of buying a car online. I live outside of San Antonio and had been looking for an economical small car for personal use for 2 weeks locally. I was about to buy a Hyundai I'd been considering, when I found that Leif Johnson was a certified USAA dealer. Online I found a 2009 Cobalt, called and spoke with the manager, who gave me a lower price after we talked awhile. He had David Egner in sales call me. David drove the car to San Antonio from Austin to my house the next day, never was the least  bit pushy - had personally checked the car out on the lot in fact while we were speaking initially on the phone. He made sure everything was working while he drove it here. I'm delighted that it is in near mint condition with 30,000 mi on it. My only concern was that the owner's manual was missing. However, I've been assured that one will be mailed to me and based on the quality of their service so far, I have no doubt it will be. This is one of 7 cars I've bought. This dealer has a 7-day policy of full refund if it were to be returned for any reason. I would definitely recommend them with confidence and David Egner for courtesy, helpfulness and consideration.

The Finance Manager was fast and friendly.  They had a young man help us at the end of the transaction- answering any and all questions- while specializing in the Sync features.  We have purchased several vehicles from this dealership in the past and they have been courteous and professional each visit.  Their Service Department has been very fantastic too.

Two and half hours later I drove out of there with a new car. I researched the trade-in value on Kelly Blue Book prior to the visit and they offered me $1400.00 more than the amount Kelly Blue Book said I would get if my car was in excellant condition.  Dave Christian and Jorge Flores were my salesmen and they were both very professional and accomodating and I highly recommend them.   I had to return to the dealership a few times after the purchase and everyone I dealt with was wonderful.  The tech guys who train you how to use the sync system in the car were both very good.

590,"August 08, 2011","I needed to replace my car and only had a couple of days to complete the process.  Peas clear onrush I needed and the price I was wanting to keep my payment.  My sales man listened, showed me my options and walked me through the up grade options.  Once I outweighed the benefits of the up grades and determined the best finance option for me I then received the talk about the cost of gap insurance and extended warranty.  When it was all said and done I wad now over my comfort zone for total price.  It would be nice to talk about all the money up front not just the sale price of the vehicle.  

I do have to give credit that moth the sales man and the finance person did spend all the time I needed to analyze the final cost.  I was also able to sit down and side by side compare two vehicles and analyze comparable cost and final payments.  I would recommend that cost, tax, gap insurance and extended warranty all be part of the initial talk.  I am sure I would have ended making the same decision but felt like I was not completely listened to when I first spoke about my initial care payment.  Just be up front with all cost.",3.4
591,"August 05, 2011","Had a very bad experience with Leif Johnson Ford today.  We picked out a $27K F150 from the Ford online inventory and Roy offered to have the vehicle transferred from the other dealership and we scheduled an appt. for 4:30p.  I get a call at 4 JUST as I'm leaving asking me to ""come a little later,"" that the truck was ""on it's way right then but stuck in traffic.""

No problem at all.  I offered to come in at a little after 5 and he agreed.  I load up my two kids and pregnant wife and we show up at 5:15, look around the lot a bit before heading into the office and find out ""my"" truck STILL hasn't arrived.

No problem, right?  It's gotta be close by now.  We wait in the crappy little front area (run down building, TV wasn't working) but I'm still psyched about getting my new 4x4 truck.  Only, the two salesman, Roy and a second who greeted us, walk by several times over 15mins without so much as a smile...much less an update.

FINALLY, I start asking random people for help and second ""salesman"" decides to go ahead and call the porter.  ""Gee, thanks!""  But wait, he hangs up and tells me the truck will be....wait for it.........ANOTHER 45mins!

My wife seriously thought he was joking with us.  I knew better...still calm, I look at my wife and say, ""Well, guess we're a leavin'!""  The ""salesman"" just turns and walks away.  No apology, no explanation, nothing.  MEANWHILE, our ACTUAL ""salesman"", Roy, just stands there and watches all this happen.  Never. Says. A. Word.

I couldn't help but say to HIM as I pass by, ""Man, what are you DOING?  I was 100% going to buy that truck right now.  It was never on the way till just now, was it?""

Not a word from him.  We walk out and proceed to call a sales manager and then Chuck (the actual manager).  Chuck goes on to tell me that the truck had 59K miles instead of 29K miles anyway, they had listed it wrong online!  At this point, I'm just stunned at their ineptitude and seemingly lax approach to acquiring my $30K business.

I say as much to Chuck, that I didn't feel like he was going to offer much to rectify the situation and maybe I should just head to another Ford dealership.  His response: ""Oh, I never said THAT.  I definitely want to sell you a truck.""

You don't say, Chuck...you DON'T SAY?  Not exactly the response I was looking for.  EVERY dealership wants to sell me a freakin' truck, Chuck.  YOU need to fix a FUBAR situation and make a new customer (who was EAGER to buy) happy.

All in all, I'm not completely surprised.  I've worked in sales all of my life and I cut my teeth at Lone Star Ford (among others) for a few years back in the day.  There are many bad salesman out there and even some bad dealerships.  Rarely though, do you find a bad ""customer service"" oriented manager.  Those guys know the business and understand that getting the customers money is all that matters.  Make them happy, make the sale, repeat tomorrow.

Chuck, I'm GOING to buy a 4x4 F150 this weekend or next week.  Roy, you COULD have made at least a few hundo in commission.  At the very least, you could have respected me more as a customer.  Truly, truly your loss.  I'll probably hit up a Chevy dealership for my used F150 now.  I don't want the Austin Ford group to make a dime from me.",1.0

Leif Johnson Ford Super Store North 183-From the time I walked in the dealership to the signing of my auto loan papers I was very impressed.  A.J. along with the other salesman who's name I do not remember,  were the most professional team I have ever met.  The other fiance folks Chris, and the other members of the sales team were not only professional but very supportive of my decision.  I loved the fact that I was able to shake the hand of Leif and that he took the time out of his busy day to met with me and give me the assurance that I was making a good decision.  The dealership was clean, no crude language, no asking a lot of unnecessary personal questions but just good ""down home"" friendly advice and encouragement and the mention of my family in a very kind way by Leif was touching.  I felt that these guys were professional and they treated me that way also.  Although I hate the debt,  I really needed another car to secure me of getting to work without break downs.  I thought the deal would be impossible but thanks to the team at Leif Johnson's my car deal was made possible.  This experience compared to the other dealerships was miles apart and such a better outcome for me the consumer!  Keep doing what your doing it is wonderful.

I called Leif Johnson about the vehicle and drove to Austin with low expectations based on my previous contacts  with the other dealerships.  As I walked up to the front door I was met by Tiffini and she invited me to test drive the vehicle which was right up front and had been reserved for me.  Wow, first impressions surpassed my previous experiences and after the test drive the actual purchase was a non event.  I had done my homework with carfax, NADA rating, blue book value etc. but even if I hadn't they had all this info ready for me.  This is a very reputable dealer.  Just no nonsense no hassle.  I told them I would pay the low internet price plus TT&L and the response was ""OK we'll type it up for you"".  Not ""let me ask the sales manager"", not ""well there is a vehicle prep fee you know"", just OK let's do this.  Refreshing to say the least.  I was also pleasantly surprised when Tiffini called a week after the sale and said she had gotten another Ford passive anti-theft key for the vehicle for me at no charge.

607,"January 28, 2011","I recently had the best car buying experience ever.  On Tuesday, January, 25th I was contacted by Tiffani Morris in regards to an inquiry I submitted through USAA Auto Circle.  I didn't realize when I submitted my inquiry that your dealership was located in Austin.  I live in San Antonio and didn't want to make that drive for a car I could probably find in San Antonio.  I spoke with Tiffani and discussed that I had already found a car for a really good price in San Antonio.  She was extremely pleasant and still willing to help if something didn't work out.  Tuesday night when I went to pick up the car here in San Antonio much to my surprise - they had just sold the car.  Our salesman offered us a deal on another vehicle.  We accepted even though is was $1000 more than the one I wanted.  Then before the paperwork started his manager would not approve the discount and only took off $300 from the sticker price.  We quickly walked out as he was wasting our time.

I called Tiffani on her cell (which she advised I could reach her at anytime).  She promised to call me in the morning with an approved price and a guarantee of the car I wanted to be available.  She called me Wednesday morning and we offered to make the drive cause of the service she was already providing.  From the moment we got there till we left (about 3-4 hours later) it was a great experience.  I have never enjoyed purchasing a new vehicle until I worked with Tiffani.  She was pleasant, friendly, down-to-earth and all around a great sales person. She wasn't pushy or demanding and made everything simple.  I know she is new to selling cars but you would think she's been doing this for years.  She is a great asset to your company and deserves a huge pat on the back.

Thank you again for making this a great experience.  I will hope to bring more business…even from San Antonio.
