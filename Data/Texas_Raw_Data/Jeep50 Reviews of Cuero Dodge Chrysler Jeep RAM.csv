13,"March 12, 2020","Carmen delivered my car which was nice of her . But It was late when we finally got home and when she showed me the inside we clearly saw that the car had not been cleaned, she said she would let them know but never got back to me. Not thinking it was a big deal, days later when I went to the groceries I put the seats down and there was rotten chocolate on the seats, which i had not done. Then to top it off the car started showing me notifications of needing an oil change. I contacted the manager and after a week of calling and calling and calling they finally came to pick up the car to get things situated. This was very unprofessional the car should've been cleaned, detailed and had the oil changed before even selling it to a customer. And another concern i have is that I'm not sure if the tires are supposed to be new on the car also before selling the vehicle but the tires on the car are clearly not new. I feel let down by this dealership especially after committing to pay a substantial amount of money. I dont think I should've
gone through this especially the calling and calling and calling to try to get this fixed.",1.0
