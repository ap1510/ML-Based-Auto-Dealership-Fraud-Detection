1,"March 20, 2019","Usually when I go in to have an oil change or my truck worked on the service is great.
This last time I took my truck in for an oil change and a little hesitation problem I was having. I was there from 8 a.m to just a little after 7 p.m. after about 5pm I started getting upset, I wasn’t being told anything I would have to go ask about my truck and get vague answers. 
If I go back there I will make sure I go to the person that helped me before the rude service I got this particular time. At least he tells me what is going on. And keeps on top of things.",2.4
2,"March 19, 2019",This was my first time buying a car. My experience was fantastic!!! Mr. Steve is the best. My family plans to shop at this dealer in the future. I recommend that others do as well. Ask for Steve Hernandez. You will not be disappointed.,5.0
3,"February 21, 2019",Jimena was very detailed taking notes of the problem and showed concern and committment to resolve it. She kept me informed on the progress they made via phone and called me to pick up my car once it was ready. She even got me a complimentary carwash. I am very satisfied.,5.0
4,"February 12, 2019",I really wanted to buy my car from AutoNation on Highway 6!  Traded in my beloved 2011 Equinox for a 2019 Traverse.  Staff was aware of why it was difficult to make this change and was very attentive.  Took too long to settle on price - going back and forth and back and forth - which I did not enjoy.  My Equinox had been cared for by Michael Linder - and he will now take over the care of my Traverse.  Michael is an asset to AutoNation - one that I would miss dearly if he were not there.  He's trustworthy and the one I went to when thinking about purchasing a new car.  He doesn't mince words and I've always felt I was in good hands under his care.  He's become a friend.  ,4.6

Arrived and Mile was waiting on me, had my truck in the repair shop in less than 10 minutes. 20 minutes later he had a loaner truck waiting for me because they needed to order a part for it.

25,"November 15, 2017","Sales guy was really helpful. Explained everything about the vehicle, very impressed by his vehicle knowledge. Very disappointed with the way the finance guy shoved so many forms in front of me to sign before we ever talked about the deal, regardless of what price was quoted to me in their email. It was all about the finance rate. After I thought the rate was OK, the flood of extended warranties never stopped, based on the finance rate. After I purchased the vehicle, I realized the original quote was never included in any of the paperwork, specifically the dealer discount. Lost out on that, water under the bridge. I should have examined the documents more closely. Here, sign... I guess that's how all the dealerships work these days. Caveat emptor! ",2.8

27,"August 29, 2017","Me and my son had an incredible experience with Mark Mckee our Sales Manager and his staff. They fed us some appetizers, got us some great coffee, made us a great deal on trading in my 2015 Chevy Silverado 4x4 and helped us get a great deal on a 2017 2SS Camaro. To have this type of experience with my 19 year old son is incredible. We will be lifetime purchasers of Chevy's from AutonNation Chevrolet Highway 6 as long as Mark McKee is working there.",5.0

30,"July 21, 2017","Mojtaba Moosapour was my sales associate the day I bought my 2017 Chevy Cruze but I came to dealership prior to that day and I financially wasnt ready to get a car, just exploring. He gave me several options and we even test drove. I decided to wait. He kept up with me via text and email. Then a few months later i emailed him that I was ready to buy a car. Within minutes MJ called me back and then a few minutes after that I was test driving the Cruze.  He made my process SO smooth and quick. I didnt want to spend the day in a dealership waiting and waiting. He was confident and very professional. I didnt feel pressured. Awesome experience! 
 The finance person, Will Rubio, was great too. He came and explained what we would be doing shortly and then we did exactly that. He worked with me on a few things and we quickly got it done. Perfect customer service! ",4.8
31,"April 04, 2017",Salesman was very helpful. The car was in perfect condition at the delivery. The price was competitive and the paperwork was quick and easily completed.,5.0
32,"March 03, 2017","I want to advice everyone not to buy a vehicle from AutoNation Chevrolet  Hwy 6 Houston, TX .They sell cars at that location that have been in accidents with out them telling you about it, do not trust car fax report. I purchased a vehicle there with 13,000 miles car was not even a year old and been having problems since i bought it. I just found out from another dealership that gets a different report ,when I went to get an appraisal that it was in a major accident 3 months before they sold it to me. And all Autonation is pretty much telling me is ""tough luck
I have proof of everything am telling you about.

33,"August 03, 2015","Purchased a used vehicle from the dealership.  Mohammed and Asif were gracious salesmen and made the experience as pleasant as possible. The finance manager, however was a bit stressful and hostile.  Management demanded that I sign a waiver for the 3 day return policy.  The manager wasn't pleasant at all and leaves one with the feeling that you have no right to anything.   A little worried about the inspection that they indicated was performed.  I must say the most positive experience was working with Mohammed G. and Asif, the salesmen.  The rest of the dealership is questionable. ",1.0
34,"June 11, 2015","I talked to their sales people yesterday about seeing the car this car today. They called me at 9:00 to verify our appointment for later in the day. When I arrived about 3:30 they told me the car had been sold this morning, but they had another similar car with more miles that they would be glad to show me. They called to verify an appointment but couldn't be bothered to call and tell me not to come? To make it even better, my son then went back on CarGurus and sent a message to the same dealer about the same car. They responded to him that the car was available but the price now quoted to him by the dealer was $2000 MORE than what they had listed on CarGurus or what they quoted to me yesterday. I'm calling Chevrolet tomorrow. I've found these same sorts of reports on this website as well as Yelp and others. It seems to be a common practice for this company.",1.2
35,"February 15, 2014","This was a great experience. I saw the car online, I printed the price and met with CJ. I was driving away within a couple of hours. Thank You!",5.0
36,"October 04, 2012","I was at Champion for an oil change.  I was told by one of the Customer Advocates that they couldn't take me because of the time.  It was 6:00 pm (The website said they close at 7:00 pm).  Donald came to our rescue!!  He waived use down to tell us that he would take care of us.  This is the second time that Donald has helped us.  We truly appreciate Donald and his attitude of helping customers.  He is a true Customer Advocate!!  We were thinking about switching from Chevrolet; however, today confirmed why we chose this dealership in the first place....great customer service.  Thanks Donald!  Thanks Champion!!!",5.0
37,"August 28, 2012","The staff at Champion were very courteous and professional.  My daughter and I were very impressed with the way the gentlemen took care of us.
