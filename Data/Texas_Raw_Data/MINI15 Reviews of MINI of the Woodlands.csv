0,"October 15, 2019","In 2013, Brian Lowden met my husband and me in the parking lot before we even got to the door.  Brian was incredibly helpful, patient and informative about the brand and specific models.  He made our purchase process incredibly smooth.  He SOLD the car to us.

However, I took my Mini to MOTW several times through the years for routine checkups and oil changes.  Why does a customer have to wait up to 4 hours for a simple oil change when I had an appointment time of which I was never late???  Refreshments nor snacks, not even updates were offered.  I would have to go to them for updates.  After the techs were finished, it was as if they were pushing me out the door!"" 

I love my MINI, but unless you are a pet of the dealership, forget feeling anything other than a nuisance!",1.7
1,"July 12, 2019","Initially I was grateful to have found a fair deal on my son's first car, a used 2013 Mini Paceman. The car was clean and the dealership made sure that it delivered well. They took care of a few minor blemishes and a cracked windshield etc. We drove the car for about a week and then went on a two week vacation (so the car wasn't being driven). I decided to drive the car to work since it hadn't been driven in a couple of weeks. While out to lunch the service engine light came on. Mini of The Woodlands is around the corner from my job so I thought I'd get them to check it out, hoping it was something superficial like a bad gas cap seal. After nearly 2 hours the service tech told me that he was sorry to have to deliver the bad news but the turbo needed to be replaced, which cost over $5,000!!! The car has been in my possession for a few weeks and less than a thousand (about 400, I believe) Mini of The Woodlands was absolutely no help and was completely unwilling to take any ownership in selling a car that clearly needed repair. I mean seriously! Not so much as a ""We're sorry, this sometimes happens"" or anything. In my opinion, they could have been a little more stand up in their approach. Perhaps something like ""Sir this is not a great deal for either of us. We would be willing to provide the labor if you will buy the part at cost""....No way was that happening. I simply got ""Sir, you bought the car as is. If it needs repair, it's on you"" It's incredible. This is a AutoNation company, I think and I am certain they are affiliated with BMW of The Woodlands as well as other local dealerships. Buyer Beware. These folks are in the car selling business and they don't care if the screw you over while doing it. ",1.4
2,"December 19, 2017","Mini of the Woodlands is an Autonation flag dealership and works through Autonation. I recently visited the dealership looking for a car I had reserved in the Autonation website. When reserving , the car is supposed to be held for 72 hours. I did get an initial call from the internet sales guy who asked me when I could come and see the vehicle. I did defer the timing and asked him to find out some details about the car. He then communicates to me that the car is pending and not available. I went to the dealership anyways at 7:00 pm as scheduled via the Autonation reservation system. I asked a sales manager to find the car for me since I wanted to see it. I am then informed that the car is not in the lot. Also that a customer had paid a $12000 deposit (who pays $12000 deposit without seeing a car?). At this point I felt I was not being told the truth. I asked to speak to the manager who also insisted the car is in transit and was already taken. They made excuses alleging that they had not control on their inventory and could not change parameters shown on the Autonation internet page. Every sales man did not look at me straight in the eye and looked like children lying where their eyesight goes down and to the left. I truly believe the car was in the lot but they probably were holding it back for some acquaintance and giving preferential treatment. All in all they did not honor the Autonation process where if a car is reserved on their stock , it should be held and shown to the party and made available for sale. If this car was truly held by another customer then why would it show as available on the Autonation page and allowed me to reserve it? SHADY SHADY SHADY",1.8
3,"April 20, 2017","I recently bought from here and I had such a good experience! My salesman was Brian and he was fantastic! Great price, great car, awesome dealership and great people to work with! I am very satisfied with my purchase and will definitely recommend!",5.0
4,"March 22, 2017","Very pleasant buying experience! Just took delivery of our new Morris Mini. Love the car! Giving a shout out to Brian Lowden, our salesman. Brian was fantastic! Very knowledgeable, helpful and answered all of our questions. We built our own and Brian explained all the choices to us. He made the entire experience very easy and comfortable.",5.0
5,"January 06, 2016","After spending 30+ years in the car business, I have been on both sides of the table. I got my new Countryman S right before the end of the year and am very pleased.  The entire team here was exceptional from Keith in the new car sales to Natalie in the finance office.  I have owned several Minis and would recommend these folks as a great place to buy or lease a Mini...Plus my normal service adviser, Kelly provides exceptional service and advice.  They have a new sales manager that I don't have any experience with but this is an Auto Nation store, so they have pretty high standards and am confident that he will do a great job.",4.8
6,"October 14, 2015","After driving 3 hours to get there, I was informed that a wheel bearing was out on the car I was interested in and it needed to be changed. This was on Saturday. They said it could be changed while I signed the papers if I wanted the car after the test drive, no big deal. I signed the papers, car still wasn't ready. After 2 hours I was informed that the hub needed to be changed and it was Honda specific, so they couldn't get the part until the following Wednesday and I should have my car the following Thursday. Still no big deal. Thursday rolled around and still no car. I called multiple times every day and each time I called, they were having to change yet another part. I kept getting the ""your car should hopefully be ready tomorrow."" Finally got the car 12 days after purchasing it. And had to pay for a rental during all of this.

The day I got the car, I went to open the trunk by pressing the button on the remote and the trunk wouldn't open. Didn't know that before purchasing the car.

After having the car for about 2 weeks, the oil light came on. Apparently the oil wasn't changed before I bought the car. Went to have my oil changed and they informed me that my transmission fluid and power steering fluid both needed to be changed badly. In addition to that, when they checked the cabin air filter, there were so many leaves and pine needles stuck on it that you could barely see the filter. I was guaranteed that Autonation dealerships only sold the best cars possible. Definitely not impressed.",2.4
7,"July 19, 2015",Wonder if this dealership is anti-military?  Sales staff and management refused to honor a discount offered by USAA members despite having shown both sales and finance departments my USAA insurance certificate prior to purchase.  Momentum Mini actually INFORMED me about the discount at the time of my last Mini purchase while I was signing the papers.  Woodlands seems only interested in the sale - not the customer.,1.6
8,"January 20, 2014","
I received aggressive and arrogant customer service during my visit at the dealership. I was originally told ""I could not drive any new cars until processing my credit report to prove I was worthy to drive the luxurious brand vehicles"". Prior to getting final numbers on the vehicle purchase, I was requested to sign over the title to my vehicle to the dealership. High pressure tactics and a condescending attitude while trying to discredit a buyers knowledge is a quick way to loose business. 

I am a qualified buyer and purchased a MINI from another dealership with a wonderful experience.  Go to Mini Southwest Freeway and see Mia!!!!!!!!!!!!

9,"August 08, 2013","I was interested in buying a Mini but didn't know a lot about them. I was hesitant because of the way I've been treated at other car dealerships. Mini of The Woodlands is close and convenient to me so I decided to try them. I was greeted by Keith Sutch and he was so friendly and informative about the Mini Cooper. He spent a lot of time with me and I changed my mind at least a hundred times. He never pressured me or made me feel like I needed to make my mind up right away like other car dealers. I can't say enough great things about Keith Sutch. I honestly feel like he's a friend not a car dealer.

10,"April 04, 2013","We had an excellent service from Mike. He showed us the cars, answered all the questions and we got a good price for the car. Certainly I would recommend it for others. 

Advice: when closing the deal a large amount of services/warranties will be offered. Check carefully the price and the value and accept only those that make sense to you.",4.8
11,"October 14, 2012",THIS IS THE WORST DEALER IVE EVER BEEN TO.THEIR MECHANIC'S ARE MORONS.I EVEN TOLD THEM WHAT WAS WRONG AND ALL THEY WANTED TO DO WAS TO JUST START PUTTING NEW PARTS ON IT AT MY EXPENSE.WHEN THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS BAD GAS.I DRAINED THE GAS TANK AND PUT NEW PLUGS IN IT AND PROBLEM FIXED.ALL THEY WANTED TO DO WAS JUST TO GET MORE MONEY.GOOD THING IM A BETTER MECHANIC THAN THEY ARE.STILL CANT BELIEVE ALL THE B....

12,"May 19, 2012","This was a terrible place to buy a car!! Keith is about the worst salesman I ever bought anything from!! Before. Had a deal he just didn't care and after trying to take delivery was awful!!!

I've had dead relatives return calls better than this man!!!!

On five different occasions he was going to call me right back and every time I had to call and ask for someone over him to have him call me!!!

If it wasn't that mini of the woodlands was the only dealer in the country that had the exact car I wanted I would have taken my business any where else!!!!

Stay away form is dealer and stay even further away from Keith Sutch!!",2.3
13,"February 24, 2012","My sales and service experience has been great.  Vicki Smario, my Mororing Advisor, was very helpful during the sale and has been a great liaison with the dealership after the sale.  Sarah Yelverton, the Motoring Manager, has also been very helpful when Vicki has been out.  I like to go over just to visit and see what's new since the're all so nice.

Further, in response to the Lilyinrain's poor review about the dealership insisting on replacing a tire that could have been repaired, most sources do not recommend repairing run flat tires.  For instance the Continental Tire (which is supplied on many MINIs) website says the following under tire repaire guidelines: ""SSR TIRES: Even a trained tire specialist may be unable to recognize internal structural damage to a SelfSupporting Runflat (SSR) tire resulting from having been driven in an under inflated or zero pressure condition. Such damage may not be visible on the surface of the inner liner or sidewall making it impossible to determine the tire suitability for repair or reuse. Continental does not recommend any repair to or reuse of
Continental SSR tires.""  So, the dealer was only reinforcing the tire manufacturer's guidance and putting safety of their customer first.  ",5.0
14,"July 12, 2011","I went there for my car's regular check and the service person told me that my tire was pierced by a nail and &quot;unfortunately it was not fixable&quot; and she insisted I should replace the tire. I did what she &quot;advised&quot; and paid $250 and it turned out it could be easily fixed within a $25 budget!! 

They seem to be only interested in getting money out of clients' pocket while cares nothing about their cars. I waited for 2 hours to get my car washed after they replaced my tire but they eventually did not wash it! I had to leave and would never come back again. ",1.3
