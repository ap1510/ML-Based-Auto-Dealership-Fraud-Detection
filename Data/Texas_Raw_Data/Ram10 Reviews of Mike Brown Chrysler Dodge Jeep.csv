Highly recommend!!!!! We had a horrible experience at a different dealership and James redeemed our belief in buying a car from a respectable and honest salesman. Go see him!",4.8
1,"March 11, 2020","Wonderful experience, 4th purchase and many referrals to them.  They have taken great care of me and my friends.  Worth the drive from Fort Worth to Granbury!",5.0
2,"August 06, 2019",Set an appointment for a simple tire replacement covered under the road hazard warranty. It took over a hour and a half past my appointment time before they even touched my truck. Took over two and half hours to get the tire replaced. Why set an appointment for service if you still have to wait for a ridiculous amount of time. It’s always a negative experience when I have to go for service. I’ll make the drive to go to Roger Williams in Weatherford from now on.,1.0
3,"March 24, 2016",I bought 2 vehicles from this dealer over the space of 6 weeks. Everything went exceptionally well. I was very impressed with how awesome these purchases went. I flew in from AZ and they picked me up at the airport an hour drive away. I would definitely recommend them to anyone who is in the market for a new vehicle.  Perfect! A+++ ask for Shelby!,5.0
4,"May 28, 2015","On 4/27/15, we took our 1997 Dodge 1500 to Mike Brown Auto Group in Granbury, Texas to be serviced for the following:  (1) a squeaking noise that could not be identified by a local mechanic, and (2) when the vehicle idles it dies.  Prior to this, we had heads replaced as well as transmission.  The service rep was Jeff Beckler.  We also told Jeff that the truck was an “Ag exempt truck” and we should not be charged sales tax.  He said he would check on that.

On 4/28/15, Jeff Beckler called and said the bearings were out and that the crank shaft was messed up.  He said to do the work would cost about $2,000.  We asked him how much a new engine would cost, since we were going to spend that much, we might consider having a new engine put in.  He said it would cost about $4500 for a “complete engine,” in his words.  My husband and I conferred and decided to replace the engine, so we called him back to let him know.  Jeff also said the engine would come with a three-year warranty.

On 5/6/15, we received a call from Jeff Beckler.  He told us the engine was done but that it would cost us an additional $40 because the engine doesn’t come with spark plugs.  I talked to him and asked him if an engine could run without spark plugs, and he said “No.”  I said “Then why would it not come with spark plugs, if you had quoted that we would receive a ‘complete’ engine?”  I told him he needed to talk to a service manager about this as I didn’t feel we should pay for new spark plugs.  He did not call me back for a while, so I decided to call him back.  The call went to his voice mail.  I tried again, and it went direct to his voice mail.  So I called and asked to speak to a service manager.  Jeremy Wood came on the phone.  I told him what I told Jeff, that a “complete” engine should come with spark plugs.  He stated that Jeff didn’t realize that the engine did not come with spark plugs, and I told Jeremy I couldn’t believe that, since an engine cannot run without them.  I told me he would take care of it.  (By this, I was under the impression he would put new spark plugs in.)

On 5/7/15, my husband, accompanied by a friend and my grandson, went to pick up the truck (3:30pm).  My husband saw on the service sheet where they had used the OLD spark plugs on the new engine.  He spoke to Jeff about this, who replied, “Well, it runs pretty good on the old plugs.”  My husband was not amused, so he asked to speak with the service manager, who was Jeremy.  Jeremy put the truck back into service, replacing the old plugs with new ones.  Personally, I think this was a ""bait and switch"" tactic, and I was not happy that a dealer would do this.  My husband paid the bill and brought the truck home.  At the time, my husband did not notice that they had charged us tax, when they should not have because it is Ag-exempt.

On 5/11/15, in the evening, the truck would not start.  Husband tried to charge the battery, but the truck would not start.  

On 5/12/15, My husband took the battery off the truck, and I took it to a local mechanic in Glen Rose.  The mechanic tested it and said it was definitely dead.  The battery was only 2 years and 8 months old.  The Glen Rose mechanic stated it could have gotten dead from not being charged during the time the truck was down for maintenance.  So I bought a new battery, brought it home, my husband installed it, and the truck started.

On 5/14/15, the truck would not start again.  Husband called Mike Brown Dodge and left a voicemail for them to call back.  At 3:45pm, Jeremy called and said he will send a tow truck to pick up the truck.  He said we would hear from the towing company.  We received a call from the towing company at 4:06pm, and they wanted to know if they could pick up the truck first thing in the morning (5/15) because by the time they came and got if from us and took it back to Granbury, the dealer would be closed.  We told them it would be okay.

On 5/15/15 the truck was picked up by the towing company.

On 5/18/15, the dealer called and said the truck was ready.  I asked them what they did to it.  The service advisor said they made “a few adjustments.”  We picked the truck up, but before we did, I had taken the bill in because they had charged us with sales tax, and I wanted to make sure we got that refunded.  The girl was very nice, and the service gal was too, but we waited at least half an hour for the service girl to find the keys and the lady who rang up the bill who had a note on the bill ($150 tow charge), and she did not know how to ring that up.  I told he we would not be paying for a tow, and she said she understood but didn’t know what they wanted her to ring it up as.  Finally, she just rang it up, we got our keys, and left.

On 5/19/15, in the evening, my husband noticed an oil leak under the truck.  The dealer was closed by the time he noticed.

On 5/20/15, he called the dealer and spoke with Jeremy who told him to bring the truck in “anytime” as he wanted to make sure it got fixed.

On 5/21/15, my husband dropped the truck back off at the dealer to figure out why it was leaking oil.  They told him it could be that they overfilled it with oil or it was leaking from a seal.  They had to keep the truck, and they gave my husband a complimentary truck to drive.

On 5/26/15, My husband received a call that our truck was ready, so he went and picked up our truck.  They said there was a leak in oil pan, but they did not give him any documentation.

I believe the dealer, in the least, owes us for a new battery because the battery had such a short life time, and I think it was due to it being without a charge for many days when they first had the truck.  We were told that the mechanic who worked on the truck had never put in an engine before, and I think this is why we had problems with the oil leak and the initial return for adjustments.  We were without the truck for 20 days throughout this ordeal (I am not including when we had the complimentary vehicle from May 21-26.)  We should have been compensated for that, as we have a ranch that we use this truck for, and we have had to suspend work because we did not have the vehicle.  Overall, this was not a pleasant experience.  ",2.0
5,"October 06, 2014",We have bought numerous vehicles from Mike Brown Jeep.  Joe has been great to work with.  He treated us great.  I highly suggest you talk to them.  their service department is great as well.,5.0
6,"April 25, 2013","If there was a button for ""fantastic"", ""awesome"" or ""Excellent"" I would have gave them that rating. The reason on why I am giving this rating is for several reasons. I, like most people, do not like ""Car Salesman"". I was very hesitant about going there because of dealing with salesman, but we had no choice. We had a Ford that was basically on it's last leg, and in our business that would have shut us down. BUT because of the effort of Vernon Knapp (salesman) and Mr. Pritchett (finance manager) they kept us going. These two guys went about and beyond the call of their position to make it work for us. I have been recommending Vernon to anyone and everyone because he is not your ""typical"" salesman and WE LOVED THAT! He was a savor to our company. We are now able to help more customers save money and be the reliable company that they deserve all because of them. We can't thank them enough. They just don't have any idea how much we appreciated them.",5.0
7,"April 06, 2013","My wife and I camped at Tres Rios Campground near Glen Rose, Texas over the Easter weekend. While there, our 2002 Dodge Ram 1500 developed a leak in the radiator. On Monday morning after Easter Sunday, we were supposed to leave the camping area to go back home.
But we were held back because of the radiator problem. I called Mike Brown Service in Granbury, and Charlie Mann (Service Advisor) handled all the details...from calling a wrecker to transport the Ram 1500 truck to the dealership and then being certain that his repair department administered the repair in a timely manner. By about 4:30 P.M. that afternoon, I was on my way back to the campground to arrange for getting ready to go home on Tuesday morning. Thanks, Charlie Mann, for your kindness and concern for our problems. Please thank all the other people who helped us when we were in a troublesome situation.",4.8
8,"June 17, 2011","Manufacturer recall for front ball joints. Only 27K miles later front lower ball joint needs replacement. Est. Cost $1200.00  Dealership claims the work was done. I assume Jeep paid them.

Ball joints don't fail after only 27K miles on a two wheel drive Jeep, driven by my wife. ""In my opinion"" the work was never done and I am left on the hook with the repairs. Jeep claims they will not pay twice for the same job.


The service manager told me a front ball joint 'can' fail in under 27K miles. This was over the phone, I did not have the opportunity to see his face as he tried to feed me this line of bull.
I have not heard from the owner as yet. 
Disappointed in Jeep, for the first time.


Shady operation here, ""In my opinion""  Be careful if you use choose to deal with these people.",1.5
9,"July 27, 2009","I had previously bought a Chrysler 300 from this dealership in December '08. 

Went in to purchase a new vehicle for my daughter ...  Very shocked and extremely disappointed that this dealership did not honor their quote from the day before!  Talked to them on Sat.(7/25/09)and Mon(7/27/09) morning, they said they couldn't honor the WRITTEN contract.  They are supposedly not participating in the Clunkers for Cash program (even though they were Saturday).  However, offered us $2500 MONDAY for a vehicle that is not even worth $700.  That tells me something.....

Extremely disappointed.
Not sure I will even be back for any regular maintance Now.  There are plenty of other people that I can go to.
