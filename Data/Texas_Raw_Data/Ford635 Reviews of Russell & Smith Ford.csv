i dont know how and why keeping that liar person in Ford.i left my truck one peice and i asked her especially when change my cabin filter dont brake my glove box.when i pick up my truck i see glove box on floor and when i asked her did you check my truck she told me yes everything done and ok with my truck while my glove box on floor and cant close at all,and saw 2 of lug nuts was loose.after talked with service manager they replaced my glove box but now i have big funny look gap on my glove boc in my 64k cost truck.
 another issue was my truck was jerking she was aware that and when i pick up truck she lied again and said its gone which still continue.
that supposed to be DEALER place where they charge double triple because of work quality but i see that they all have cheap non experience workers and advisers.even when i contact with Ford they didnt even do anything about my glove box advised me to deal with them.so sad.now i have large enviroment and telling them saty away from ford is far far away from build tough",1.4
1,"August 06, 2019","I bought a Transit van last year and I was told that I was entitled to two free oil changes but they never mentioned that I had a time frame of one year to get the two oil change. Spoke to Josh the Manager and he didn‚Äôt do anything about it. So for all the new buyer be aware of that because the finance department didn‚Äôt mention anything about the timeframe or 12,000 miles.

4,"March 31, 2019","I have been coming to Russell & Smith Ford for a number of years for service of my vehicles. My most recent visit was for the 100,000 miles service.  I was very pleased with service I received. My Service Advisor kept me abreast of the repairs that were needed; as well as when the different items were completed, and how much longer it would be before the entire job was completed.",4.6
5,"March 29, 2019","I brought in my 2013 Ford Fusion Hybrid for a flashing engine light to Russell & Smith Ford.  The service representative Drew Bethel was very helpful and concerned with resolving my problem.  Drop off of my car at the dealer was very quick and efficient.  My car was repaired in 2 days, and I was notified by Drew throughout the process.  The spark plugs were replaced and the throttle body cleaned, and now my car runs great.  I would bring my car back for future service because of the excellent customer service from Drew Bethel.  They also washed my car which was great.  The only improvement I would suggest is that this dealer was unable to resolve a second problem (unrelated to the first) which was identifying a slight noise my car makes when accelerating at speeds around 30 to 40 mph.  This noise was definitely not normal and the dealer was unable to resolve this problem.  ",4.2

11,"March 15, 2019","I went to the lube area for an oil change and had terrible customer service on March 13, 2019. I called multiple times and was on hold and transferred multiple times. Someone picked up the phone and said ‚Äúthey aren‚Äôt answering, but I will walk over and give them your message‚Äù. I had asked them not to throw out my old filter. I dropped my Ford Edge at about 1215pm and they never called me that my car was ready. My husband picked me up from work and drove me to the Russel and Smith service center and I told them that they never called me. Karla  then said I called but maybe the wrong #. I said ‚Äúyou all have my number because you texted me, I then texted several times and no one answered‚Äù. Karla was then was quiet AND the filter was thrown away and no one could get it!!!! I received  a text from Karla on 3/14/19‚Äôasking if the car was ok. Really?????????",1.0

33,"January 16, 2019","So, to sum up my experience with Russell & Smith Ford. 
‚Ä¢ They were not honest about the cost of the car.
‚Ä¢ Did not present the correct car for a test drive.
‚Ä¢ Lied during the procedure of purchasing the car and delivery
‚Ä¢ Withheld truthful information about the car being damaged.
So I end my review, saying once again, I found the salesmen and dealership to be dishonest and not forth coming with the truth. I would not deal or buy another car from Russell and Smith Ford.

40,"January 04, 2019","We knew exactly what we wanted going into Russel & Smith. I submitted an online inquiry and Rishi called within an hour to make an appointment. I am still waiting to get a response from other dealers who I submitted an online inquiry to! Rishi pulled the car up and answered all of my questions/concerns immediately. Negotiations were over a 2 day period but once we agreed on the price all I wanted was for it to be quick and easy. Russel & Smith definitely did that and I was in and out in less than 2 hours when purchasing the new car. A few days later, I text Rishi who sold us our expedition and he was very responsive answering all questions I had about the technology in the vehicle. It was a very easy process and would go back to Russel & Smith to purchase another car and recommend others to do the same. The customer service exceeded my expectations!",5.0

59,"November 14, 2018","Took my vehicle in 2017 Super Duty with 17k miles on it and into one oil change, the units have a history of breaking down to known bad fuel pumps in them, (Bosch CP4) I suspected I was a victim of that issue and and unit shut down on me, and they immediately place the blame on me and the fuel I use. Ins Co. gets involved and lab samples state the unit probably died because of iron particles/metal/rust in the fuel system and possible fuel filter failure. Russel Smith tries to push the issue on me and wants $ 15k to repair , of course I've met with one service director Shane Wortham, he said my son probably put regular gas in the tank, (My son doesn't even live in the state Of Texas) the other service MGR wont even return my calls Desiree to discuss. 

Maintenance Guide Clearly states change Fuel Filter every 22,500 miles or when indicated on Message Panel, one service advisor Bryan Foster said it was my fault because I didnt change the fuel filter between oil changes. at 17k miles no change is needed especially at the firs oil change. (How about you had a crappy fuel filter in there from the assembly line that failed-MAN UP)

	Truck oil light came on and I had my truck towed to Russell and Smith Ford and spoke for Service Advisor Keith Black approximately 9am.  He informed me he would call me back later that day or early Wednesday with diagnosis and cost.

8/23/18 (Thursday)
	After numerous calls to Keith Black, I went to Russell & Smith Ford at approximately 5:30pm to see what is going on with my truck. Keith Black informed me, it was the oil Pump and I needed another one and it leaked oil in the engine and damaged the timing chain and other mechanical parts I cannot remember in the engine.  He told me the repair and labor should be about $2500.00. He informed me it would be ready by next Tuesday.

8/28/18 (Tuesday)
	Again after numerous call to Keith Black I had to go up to the dealership due to no response or call back at approximately 5:30pm, and see why my vehicle is not fixed.  Keith Black informed me that they had just gotten to it and it would be ready Thursday. I immediately informed him that I was starting vacation and I had a memorial service for my Farther in Louisiana on 8/30/18 and I had planned to leave Wednesday night.  He informed me that my Truck will be ready Thursday.  I then informed him I would be there Thursday afternoon with my things ready to pick up my truck and get on the road.

8/30/18 (Thursday)
	Approximately 2pm Thursday afternoon, I came to the dealership to pick up my truck.  I asked for Keith Black and went looking for him.  He told me my truck was still no ready and I asked him why didn‚Äôt he call me instead of have me come there from La Porte for nothing.  I told him this is costing me money and wasting my vacation time.  He said tomorrow, Friday, it will be ready.  I told him I was coming with my things ready to get on the road.

8/31/18 (Friday)
	Approximately 3pm Friday afternoon I came back to the dealership, due to no response from Keith Black.  I was dropped off with my luggage ready to pick up my truck and get on the road. Keith Black then told me they rushed my truck repair and somehow the starter got messed up and he would not charge me labor if I paid for the part about $150.00.  I told him do it and get my truck running.  In the meantime I need to get on the road to Louisiana.  He then got Shane Worsham involved to get me a rental vehicle.  Shane Worsham didn‚Äôt want to give me a rental but Keith Told him I needed a vehicle due to him promising me my truck would be ready.  Shane then told me make sure I was back on Monday and they would have my truck ready.  I told him Monday was a holiday and he said that they will be open and someone will be there.  

9/3/18 (Monday-Labor Day)
	After cutting my holiday weekend short, I drove back from Louisiana to the dealership and as I suspected, no one in the service department was there.  I then went into the new car show room and asked for the Owner.  I was directed to Sam ---------- who informed me that he would email the Service Director, and General Manager about my situation and asked for my contact information and email to include me on the email.  I then left.

9/4/18 Tuesday
	I went back to the dealership expecting my truck to be fixed.  Again I was told by Keith Black that is was not ready and it would be ready Thursday.  I left visibly upset.

9/6/18 Thursday
	I was called approximately 4pm on my mobile phone by Keith Black and informed my vehicle was ready.  I picked up my vehicle at 5:30pm and informed by Keith Black that it was good to go and he drove it for about 20 min with no problems.  I then drove to my job to pick up my laptop.  On the way there I noticed it was not getting power when I pushed the accelerator.  Then about a mile further up the road the check engine light came on.  I was at my job then.  After I picked up my laptop, I headed back to the dealership.  When I got on Main St from OST the engine started making a weird clanking noise.  When I got to the dealership I parked my truck in the service lane and picked up the rental keys off of Keith Black‚Äôs desk and left him a note to call me.

9/7/18 Friday
	I was called by Keith Black to bring in the keys to my truck.  When I got to the dealership I went directly to Shane Worsham‚Äôs office and asked him if he had a second to come look at my truck with me. I told him about the check engine light and the weird clanking noise coming from the engine. When I popped the hood we both noticed the Engine cover cove was not replaced and the under carriage place was missing as well.  He informed me he would handle the repairs himself.  He called me later in the day about 3pm and informed me that the original issue was misdiagnosed and he was going to refund my payment.  He then told me that he will find out the real problem and get a quote for me to get if fixed. He told me he would call me Monday with a diagnosis and price quote on repairs. 

9/11/18 Tuesday
	I emailed Shane Worsham inquiring about the diagnosis and quote for repairs.  He then emailed me saying, ‚ÄúI will have Keith call you now with the estimates. My apologies!!‚Äù 


9/14/18 Friday
	8:16 am I missed a call from Shane Worsham.  I returned his call at 8:38am and he told me to tell him which engine I wanted to tell him when to deliver the truck.  I told him no one called me and this is the first time I have heard about an engine for my truck.  He told me Keith email me and I should have gotten the email quote.  I told him I would get back to him that I had to check my email.  I returned to the service dept after work and asked if my truck was covered with the 36 month unlimited mile warranty?  Shane told me that the quotes were for new engines because at this point I needed a new engine.  I told him $3600 is all that i have because they messed up my engine.  If you completely broke it you should completely fix it.  I was informed that i can either buy a new or used engine less the $3600 i have already paid and come pick up my truck.  I told him to put my truck back together and  refund my money and deliver it to my home address and then I was told they don't have  towing service and I would have to tow it myself.

          My truck is ready to be picked after going up there every day to check if I could pick it up.  I paid a towing service to pick up my truck and tow to my residence.

The only time spent at the dealership was when we test drove the car, learned about it's cool features while sitting in the car, then went to financing. There was no back and forth since pricing was spot on. Lorena & Rishi were informative and at no time did we get the ""sleazy skeezy car salesman vibe"" from anyone there.

91,"October 01, 2018","DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THESE PEOPLE. PLEASE READ. 

I had taken my 3 year old truck in for service, because I have the Ford service package, and this was the closest Ford dealership to my home.  When I got it back it back the last time, they didn't wash it as normal, and they parked it in a way that they don't normally (they didn't pull it into the pick up area,  they parked it so the front end was up against a wall of the dealership's garage). I was in a hurry, so I wasn't concerned about the wash. I took the truck home and found that the front end had been marred, with scratches to the grill, large scratches on the front end and hood, and the front fascia pushed out of alignment.  There was no damage to the front bumper, so it was clear to me that no other vehicle had caused the damage. 

I had a dashcam in my truck, but when I went to receive the memory card, I found that the camera had been damaged, as if the person who damaged the truck tried to remove the memory card from the camera. The camera was no longer functional.

I called the dealership and received no response, so I drove down there and met with the service manager,  Shane Worsham, who stated he would review the security video of the vehicle pulling into the dealership to ensure the damage was not there when I pulled into the dealership. He told me he would be out of town for a week, but he would follow up with me upon his return. 

A week and a half later, I had not heard from Shane, so I called him, and he told me he had totally forgotten about me. He stated that he would get back to me soon. 

After playing phone tag, he got in touch with me ar the beginning of the third week to let me know that they couldn't really tell if the damage was the or not in the video.  I explained to him again that the damage could not have occurred anywhere else due to nature of the damage.  Shane did not offer to repair the damage that his service personnel caused to my vehicle. 

Now, after playing for a Ford service package to take care of my vehicle, Shane's team is forcing me to lay for damaged they caused out of my own pocket. How dishonest can a car dealership be? I'm not sure, but Russell & Smith Ford is the absolute worst one I have dealt with.

117,"September 01, 2018","Anywhere else is better than this place. After my experience today, I will never come back. I had a corroded battery cable that needed to be replaced. I was prepared to spend quite a bit due to the fact that Ford engineers made the asinine decision to make it that you could not replace individual terminals on the cable. That was fine. Background info: 2014 with 21k miles. 

The average cost of a battery cable replacement should be around $300... maybe $350. I ended up paying a lot more than that. Labor costs are absolutely ridiculous but what is even more ridiculous is that parts are listed cheaper on the Russell and Smith Ford Parts page and they will not honor those prices. Trust me. I tried and even showed the ""service advisor"" who said Parts would not budge on the cost. Service advisor said he made up the difference on the cost of the part from subtracting from the cost of labor. If that was the case, labor would have been astronomial.

The part that I had replaced DLZ3-14300-D is listed as $146.29 but I was charged $267. Here is the real kicker, the MSRP List Price on their own website is $237.49 before their discount. 

They also recommended I buy a battery, which I do need. They quoted it as $150. Again, more expensive than their parts website. A BXT-65-750, 750 amp battery, is $116.44 on their website. I refused the battery and will purchase elsewhere. 

Check it out for yourselves. Type Russell Smith Ford Parts in google and look it up for yourselves. 

Russell & Smith Ford hosed me and will most likely hose you too. Learn from my mistake. Go anywhere else but here. I would hope to receive the difference in cost in parts and a reasonable rate on labor but that will probably not happen. I regret even buying my truck from this dealership four years ago.",2.0

The statement of work showed the set price included rotating tires.  The service tech did a multipoint inspection which included turn signals.  I knew that a rear turn signal was out.  The multi point inspection said all turn signals worked.  I told the service advisor.  He simply said ""Oh.""  No offer to do anything about it (even though two mechanics were sitting in the office next to him).  I next went to the auto part store and bought a bulb to change my own tail light.  The summary of charges states that a brake system flush was recommended but not performed.  The service advisor never said anything to me about that.  Moreover, the written recommendation inconsistently states that the brake fluid was ""dirty"" and that your records show that the maintenance is recommended.  Perhaps based on mileage?

167,"May 11, 2018","My wife and I just bought a 2018 F150 from Russell and Smith Ford and it was the best experience at a dealership we ever had. The dealership was nice and clean and all staff were friendly. There was no haggling and no pressure. We were referred to Chris from a friend who bought his F150 there. I got to tell you, Chris Alvarez is the man...friendly, knowledgable, and extremely helpful. After we bought the car, he spent time to make sure we understood all the buttons and functions of the vehicle before we left. He even synch my phone and Ford Pass app to the vehicle. I have never written a positive or negative buying experience before. I never felt stressed as I have in the pass buying expereince. If you're looking for a Ford, look up Chris Alvarez at Russell and Smith. 

To Peter in Finance, thanks for the painless and pleasant experience today. Most importantly, thank you for serving our country!

I do NOT recommend this dealership to ANYONE. Shane Worsham(Service Manager) and Bryan Foster(Commercial Service Manager) Are the poorest choice of under qualified managers that Ford has ever let on their payroll. They are both a complete laughing stock and stand behind nothing they say. Especially when their own mechanics are the ones to blame.

They said it would not be covered by the warranty, just because Ford said so, no other reasoning. Blamed it on corporate. I spoke with friends who work at other dealerships and they said this was not true. They had me for a rental car which I had already had to pay for for 2 days before hearing from them. Turning in the rental car and going to another dealer to get it done under warranty would have taken more days, another rental, etc. so I paid them to fix the rotors. Also, they were to fix a loose mirror and change some program settings on the vehicle, which were not done. Take your vehicle elsewhere for service.",1.2

174,"June 17, 2017","I was buying a used Ford I found online in Houston.  I have a great relationship with my local Ford Dealership and my service advisor advised me to go to a nearby Ford Dealership and have a used car inspection done before I purchase the car.  So before flying to Houston from Nashville I made an appointment to do just that.  When I arrived they did not have my appointment and the Service advisor said he didn't even know what a used car inspection was.  It went downhill from there.  When they made a report on it, no one came and told me my car was ready, no one read over the report with me until I brought it to a managers attention and even then he missed half of the really important information on the sheet and I had to go back and ask for things as I read thru it.  It was like pulling teeth to get anyone to assist me there.  There was one really nice young advisor that helped me sync up my bluetooth with the car before I drove off otherwise it was a horrible experience and I would advise if you need a Ford service department never go to Russell and Smith at 3440 South Loop West.  The advisor that helped me - Tyrone Perry was new so I would give him a break but he rolled his eyes, made big sighs like I was wasting his time, not helpful, no service customer communication and no assistance unless I pulled it out of him.  I don't know how he is going to last with no skills or talent to help his customers.  Maybe that is a failure of his manager and dealership for not training him appropriately before placing him in that position",1.0

185,"February 28, 2017","Worst Car Buying Experience of my life! On Saturday, February 25, 2017, my husband and I spent 5 hours sitting in this dealership trying to buy a 2007 Kia Sedona. We knew the vehicle we wanted. We were initially pleased with our experience. After the test drive and we decided we wanted the van, everything started going downhill. 

The paperwork took much longer than it should have, in large part due to our salesman, Muhammed, who everyone repeatedly told us was new. We tried to be patient, everyone has to learn. It soon became obvious that Muhammed had no clue what he was doing. We were shuffled from one seating area to another. We finally completed the paperwork with someone else. 

We were then told that the van was being detailed. So we waited. Two hours later, after being told multiple times that it was almost finished, we were told that there was a mix up and the van was being fully detailed. Then we were told the van needed to pass the final inspection before they could release it. By this time, the garage was closing, so a man named Jim told us he would give us a loaner and that our van would be delivered to us Monday, February 27. 

By 1:00 p.m. Monday afternoon, we had heard nothing. I called 3 times, my husband called once. Finally, around 3:30, Muhammed called me back. I was told the van would be ready in about an hour and half. At 4:53 p.m., Muhammed called to tell me he was on his way to my office building with the van. 

After Muhammed left in the loaner car, I realized he had left the remote to a Lexus in my new van. I then pushed the overhead button to open the sunroof and the entire section of plastic and buttons fell down and just dangled. I realized that someone had broken the plastic surrounding the buttons in two places.

When we test the van, I pushed all the buttons. The overhead plastic was not broken. All the buttons worked. Nothing was broken. The sliding door on the driver side was not working properly and we were told they would fix it. The door is still not working. 

On Tuesday, my husband took the van back to the dealership to try and get them to fix what they broke. No one would even talk to him. He said people were literally running away from him.

I understand that you buy a used car as is. When we bought the car and signed the paperwork, we were happy with the condition it was in. I fully expected them to fix what they broke. 

I emailed the General manager, Anson Jones and have heard nothing.

Horrible customer service and they don't seem to understand the definition of truthful.

Go somewhere else. It will save you boat loads of time and frustration.",1.6
186,"January 23, 2017","I found a used truck on cars.com that was being offered by this dealership. When I called them inquiring about the truck they said they'd email me an out the door price. When they sent this it was several thousand more. I called and they said the truck was priced incorrectly and Allah was very unprofessional to say the least. I had to continually call and text Brandon the sales guy for pictures of the truck with very poor return communication. I texted him twice to confirm that truck was a short bed but he never replied, I then called and he said he was standing in front of the truck and that it is indeed a short bed. I fly from AZ to TX to get the truck and when I get there the truck is a LONG BED! After several hours of being pushed to the side as they help other customers I finally get a discussion. Daniel a manager acknowledges that he is positive that Brandon made a mistake. The made it very clear that they would not pay to fly me back home nor my flight expense to get it there to find that the truck was not what they had sold me on. The pictures they kept sending me were at terrible angles so you couldn't tell and that's why I kept asking to make sure. Keep in mind I just spent $560 on a ONE way plane ticket! So I was stuck making a decision if I should fly back home and have to have came out of pocket for over $1,000 or if I should just accept the truck not being what I wanted nor was told it was. I told them that I would like for them to take $1,000 off the price of the vehicle because that's what it would have cost them to fix their mistake ethically by paying for my flight out there and back because their salesperson misled me and gave me the wrong information which not only cost me hundreds of dollars to get there but also my time. They were still once again refusing to do that and said that they would knock $500 off the price of the truck but if I did not buy the truck I would be on my own to get back home and all expenses that come along with that. This is the absolute worst buying experience I have ever had and I cannot believe the people that act in this fashion can stay in business.

I felt like the sales team worked hard to provide me a payment in the range I was looking for without much haggling (Joe Rodriguez was great). The downfall was going into the finance room. The finance team member I spoke with (James) was nice but the director of finance  or sales (not sure of his name) was brought in and WORE me down. He kept talking and talking for 20 minutes pushing me towards a sale on a warranty (which is fine- but I don't need it forced down my throat). I didn't even have silence to think, each time there was a pause he pushed again. Talking to me about my vehicle like I couldn't afford what I was getting into. He then goes on to say ""you would think you were really wealthy if you didn't know"" and things like ""ballin' on a budget"" just seemed innaproproate/ uncomfortable that someone would make comments on my finances like that. Besides that interaction my experience was fine, after that I wanted asprin and to leave.

We test drove a few cars, but made it clear we weren't ready to purchase for a few months.  We were not pressured at all.  James gave us great information, ran some numbers for us and let us know if we had any questions he was available.  

This week we dropped back at the dealership and asked for James.  He remembered us and the cars we had been looking at even though we hadn't seen or spoken to him in 2 months!  He let us drive some cars again.  We talked trim levels and pricing and then went home to sleep on it.  One of the cars we were interested in had not been available to view, so James promised to get back in touch with us.  He was off the following day, but gave me a call when he was back in the office to let me know the car was available.  He let me know the best time to drop by when things wouldn't be busy and he and the Russell and Smith Ford team stayed late to make us a great deal, get the car ready for us, finalize all the paperwork and get us out the door.  

There was an odd issue with the bluetooth system, no big deal, but James texted me the following morning to let me know he had asked and found some solutions.  I was able to reset the system and everything is working fine.

294,"April 29, 2015","If you had asked me last week if I was going to buy a car over the weekend, I would've told you that it wasn't an option, but I was wrong.  After some car trouble, I decided to to test drive a Ford Focus ST at Russell & Smith.  After walking into the dealership, I was greeted by Chris Alvarez.  Chris was very knowledgeable about the vehicle that I was interested in, and he didn't hesitate to help me when I told him that I wasn't interested in buying that day.  While Chris did try to up sell me on a higher trim, after explaining to him that I wasn't interested in purchasing that car, he didn't bring it up again.  Although I hadn't planned on buying a car last week, Chris's excellent customer service and knowledge changed my mind.  Chris was able to negotiate with me on the price of the car, and I left with the car that I wanted at a great price.  

I also financed the car through Russell & Smith.  Even though it was the end of the day, and she had been at work for 12 hours, Emmie Weil was a pleasure to work with.  She explained all of the different options available to me, and when I found a discrepancy in my interest rate, she corrected it without hesitation.

I had an excellent experience and Russell & Smith Ford.  Chris's excellent customer service and knowledge coupled with Emmie's easy going attitude made for an easy purchase.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend working with Russell & Smith Ford.",5.0

301,"April 16, 2015","I was looking to buy a new F-150. I was looking at either the Lariat, FX4, King Ranch, or Platinum. After looking at the 4 trims I decided on either a King Ranch or a Lariat. If you ask me I believe these 2 trims are premium high end trucks, so I expect premium sales service especially from a salesman that I have dealt with before. I e-mail Steven Tillett and we talk for a couple of days and after view the the 4 trims I was leaning more towards a King Ranch. The time i spent at the dealership with Mr. Tillett he was always on his phone texting someone so it always seemed like he was preoccupied with something else and that he did not really want to make a sale. This was the worst experience I have had buying a vehicle. I would not recommend this dealership to anyone if this is how an employee that has worked at this dealership for 10+ years treats customers. He also said some unprofessional things to me in an e-mail. He told me that one of the vehicles that I liked was not a demo vehicle when I found out later from Planet Ford in spring that it was a demo vehicle. Which tells me he was going to try and sell me a vehicle that had 4000 miles on it for a new price. He even bad mouthed other dealerships.",1.0

320,"March 30, 2015","It had been a while since our family had bought a vehicle, so we weren't sure about what to expect. The first thing we did was to look up vehicles online and compare prices between various dealerships. Though some of the prices were fairly even, the Russell Smith dealers stood out most of the time. For the particular vehicles that we had in mind, not only did they have them...but they had them at fairly lower prices than that of the competitors. We had read the reviews of many previous customers. so were also hoping to come with a great buying experience. And that is exactly what we got thanks to Stephen Brooks (A.K.A PH). From the moment he came out to greet in the lot, you could tell that he was a friendly person. He offered to help us and had none of the ""buying pressure"" that other salesmen are known for. Unlike the stories that your hear about evil sales people, PH was different. It was easy to talk to him and he assured us that he could be help and got us the vehicle that we came in for. For anyone reading this review online, you'll be in good hands with anyone from Russell Smith Ford, but know that PH will definitely make sure that you have a great buying experience.

They had cleaned the car (detailed it) and had given it a mechanical check and an oil change.  They worked with me on the price and gave me a 3 month warranty on certain powertrain components.

He made sure that we left with the vehicle we were looking for, for our family and we left feeling no buyers remorse. He generally cared about our needs and what was right for our family. 

Hector Martinez in Russell & Smith Ford Finance was also an awesome repersentation of Russell & Smith Ford. He also assisted us for several days making sure that we were right where we needed to be in the vehicle we were looking for. He expressed general care for us and the choices we were making. He displayed excellant customer service.

Finance Manager Natali Wood who also assisted us was very patient, and walked us through all the paperwork at signing and addressed all questions correctly and confident. She displayed excellant customer service and patience even when we need to take breaks to discuss pending sales. 

We will defintly be back to Russell & Smith Ford, and will be referring additional family members.

To begin with, Joe Rodriguez was my salesperson and regardless of the question or issues, he worked his butt off to make certain that I was satisfied.  Initially, this was by phone as we hashed out the deal for the expedition that my wife and I wanted.  After nearly a week of correspondence by phone and electronically, we had essentially worked out agreeable terms.  At this point, I was handed over to Stephen Raggette to complete the F&I.  While we differed in the beginning, Stephen also bent over backwards to get us what we wanted for the monthly payment we wanted.  

As work prevented my wife and I from traveling to Houston on a weekday, we had to make the trip on a Saturday.  When we arrived, the vehicle looked ready and we were hopeful that we would be in and out.  Unfortunately, a close inspection revealed an unknown issue to the dealership and thankfully, they had not one, but two other vehicles that were identical.  The second expedition we were shown also had a minor issue, but the third one was the charm.  I give credit to David Cooke, the new car sales manager for his efforts to make this happen.  

In the end, my wife and I had exactly what we were looking for and thanks to the refreshments that our salesman Joe provided, we were not to famished through the process, which did take some time.  I thank Joe, Stephen, and David for their patience and perseverance in making us happy with our purchase!  ",5.0

That's definitely going above and beyond.",5.0
431,"July 06, 2013","The Air conditioning was fixed in a timely manner.  Other items that had never been fixed right after I purchased the car two years ago were not fixed.  I was basically accused of lying about the passenger side visor having been broken all along.  I brought it in several times right after the purchase with a list to be fixed.  They never fixed the window crack claiming that the window guy wasn't there.  I came back several times when he was supposed to be there, but to no avail.  Additionally, one of the visors was fixed but the other one never was.  I was told by Luis that  ""why would they have fixed one and not the other?""  That was exactly my point, but they did just that. He seemed to be implying that I was lying about the visor having been broken since the purchase.

This is my third car that I have purchased from Russell Smith,  Luis has been there four months and obviously doesn't value his clientelle.  My Freestar cost me so much money in repairs (transmission to name one of many), that I had to purchase a new car (used).  Because the Freestar began to cost me so much in repairs, I got behind in payments.  In order to qualify for the purchase of the Explorer, I had to get the Extended Warranty.  Neat trick - sell cars of poor value and make the customer pay for the low quality.  

The first year that I had the Explorer, a tire blew out on the freeway while I was driving with two of my children.  We had to buy four new tires right then (almost $900.00).  I get the feeling that your dealership is just trying to move cars and doesn't stand by the quality of the used cars that they sell.   

Needless to say, we will not purchase any more cars from Russell Smith.  Now I just have to figure out if my extended warranty is valid at other dealerships. By the way, I am a teacher with four children, so extra cash is difficult to come across.  I feel very taken advantage of as both a woman and a customer.  Too bad since y'all are so close to my home.

441,"March 31, 2013","The experience at Russell & Smith Ford started with a lie and continued to get worse, and worse, and worse‚Ä¶and worse.  The car was dropped off on 3/4/13 at about 10 AM at their body shop, which is in a separate location from their main dealership and their mechanical repair shop.  The car was to be ready ‚Äúin a week to 10 days‚Äù.  It is now 3/29/13 at 12 Noon and we still do not have the car.  
The car was taken in for body repairs due to a car wreck and mechanical repairs that were separate from the body/mechanical repairs of the car wreck.  We were told both could be done while we had the rental car for the body repairs from the wreck because the insurance would have to approve a supplemental check for more extensive repairs than they estimated.  The non-wreck repairs included a windshield replacement, a State inspection, a driver‚Äôs side rear window not working, a drivers side mirror that had permanently burned in the shaded mode and the power pedals were stuck at the top with only a second of movement to the floor.
	On 3/27/13 we went to pick up the vehicle ‚Äúthat was ready‚Äù, had been through their ""quality control"" inspection [WHAT A JOKE] and all repairs were complete, including additional repairs of a brake master cylinder, an idler arm, sway bar links, rear shocks and an alignment all discovered during a steering and suspension inspection we did not request or know they did for a State inspection.  The mechanical repair shop noted a windshield whistle from an air leak, on there ‚Äútest drive‚Äù for the suspension and contacted the body shop to see if the windshield had been replaced, which they confirmed.  The body shop then drove the car and said, ‚Äú A window was down‚Äù.  When I drove the car on 3/27/13 the whistle was there and they had not replaced the mirror, but were charging us $600+ for repairs not done to the car.  This then made us question the other $2,000 plus in repairs that we had not know about but were supposedly done.
	On 3/29/13, after calling for the owner at 10:45AM, after being told that ‚Äúhe was the only person over both the body shop and their main dealership mechanical repair shop‚Äù, and getting a call back from the VP-operations about where the car was and when it would be ready, [promised for 9:30AM 3/29/13, no call by 10:30AM, told by VP done on 3/28/13 4:20PM BUT NO CALL] we went back to get the car only to find someone in the car removing grease stains from the seats that were not there when we dropped it off and made it past their ""quality control"" inspection [NOW A BIGGER JOKE].  I drive the car and the power pedals are not installed/adjusted correctly, the alignment is pulling right and now the auto door lock button does not work {""quality control"" inspection [NOW A EVEN BIGGER JOKE]}.  
Imagine if you can this getting worse‚Ä¶well it does.  The bill was not ready and was in 3 different parts, not including the wreck bill to add another part, the rental car that they were to pay for, for 7 days, was not resolved, enterprise rental car cheated and lied [another review] and we had to take the car to the main dealership to get the power pedals, alignment and door lock looked at, after paying over $2300 for repairs.  We spent most of the afternoon [1PM to 4:30 PM] picking up a ‚Äúcompleted and inspected car‚Äù.  Russell & Smith Ford did pay for 7 day rental on the car and gave us a 10% discount, but this hardly makes up for all of time, expense, non-communications, miss communications, false promises and basically telling us many things that were not true or done correctly.  An experience you do not want to go through EVER, and one we will not repeat.

I will tell you I have purchased many many vehicles in my life, and seldom do I walk away satisfied that the dealer and saesman were really interested in my satisfaction, but with Joe and the R&S team, I felt they really cared.

446,"February 28, 2013","I would like to commend Joe Rodriguez for the service he gave me while buying my 2009 Ford Fusion.  I felt like he was honestly interested in making sure I got into a car that I would be happy with - and not just in making a good sale.  He was very knowledgeable about the advantages and disadvantages of different models (not just Ford) and helped me choose a car that I am now very happy with.  He then was very gracious in setting up a test drive period of several days so that I could have my mechanic across town evaluate it, and then he worked well with me to take care of the maintenance-related work that my mechanic recommended.  After buying the car he has called me several times to see how it was working out, which is the kind of follow-up service I have not seen very often.  That gave me a chance to ask about a few minor concerns I had and he was very quick to offer to have it looked at, which impresses me as a continuing interest in my satisfaction.

I may not have got the price as low as I‚Äôd hoped, but I got a good deal and received excellent customer treatment.  I certainly plan to talk to Russell & Smith when my daughter turns 16.

449,"February 06, 2013","My wife and I went to the dealership to trade in our 2008 Mini Cooper S for something that we could actually fit our entire family into.  We went there with the intention of test driving a couple of different Ford Explorers to see what would best fit our budget and our family's needs.  We were completely ready to walk away if the price wasn't right.  Being a member of the DAV I already had a good deal going with Ford to get employee level pricing, but before I could even tell Paul (our salesman) about our deal he had already beaten the price.  The employee price we had was $125 over dealer invoice, but Paul started us well below that.  On top of that there was a whole bunch of rebates and other offers he added on.  When they finally ran the numbers the payment was at the absolute highest monthly payment that we could afford and we were ready to walk away.  Paul said, ""what more can we do to get you in that Explorer today?""  Basically we said knock $30 off of our monthly payment (about $1500 more off the price of the vehicle) and you've got yourself a deal.  He did it!  They ended up giving us within $500 of the Kelly Blue Book trade-in price for our Mini!

461,"November 11, 2012","I spent weeks going to numerous Ford dealerships in the Austin, Texas area, and was less than impressed with the treatment I got from a number of them. This sense came about for several reasons, ranging from Sales rep apathy, to price inflexibility, to outright rudeness and shady business practices at one of them (amazingly, this was in the final minutes of closing a deal on a cherry Ford F-150 Lariat tricked out like a starship, wherein the smarmy, arrogant finance guy shoved a document at me, one I hadn't seen before, and expected me to sign it, but not retain a copy of it; Right!) I snapped an iPhone pic of it, and it wasn't until later at home, whilst scrolling through the legalese therein, that I noticed the fine print at the end of it stated in bold print that the dealer was not guaranteeing that the brand new Lariat I was about to buy had not had repair work done on it. WTF? I took my $26K + down payment cashier's check, and I walked. You guys know who you are. Shame of it all: my sales rep was as nice and down to earth as they come, a fellow native Texan like me. Sorry, Travis. Guess it wasn't meant to be.

I was about to give up on buying a new Ford truck altogether, when I decided to Google Ford dealerships in Houston (the city where I spent a good part of my growing up years). One thing led to another, and I found my dream wheels online. I guess the stars must finally have been in the proper alignment, because when I asked the phone receptionist at Russell &amp;amp; Smith to put an honest, straight shooting sales rep on the phone, she laughed and connected me with Steve Houtkooter. I could tell from the start that this guy was going to treat me right--he was friendly, genuine, and confirmed for me that my dream F-150 was, in fact, on their lot.  When I wasn't able to make it down to Houston for a couple days, he did his best to &amp;quot;set it aside for me.&amp;quot;  Keeping in touch with him via cell on my drive down there, by the time I pulled up, he had freshly washed the vehicle that was exactly what I'd been looking for.  

Steve has an appealing, engaging and positive in-person demeanor. He's a former Marine Corporal (inactive reserve), and out of his four years in the corp, served 13 months in Iraq, which scored really big points with me, as I am a huge supporter of our troops.  He immediately impressed me as being a man whose word was good, in contrast to some of the sales reps I'd dealt with in Austin (trust me on that one; if I told you what some of them pulled on me by way of dealing, you probably would have given up on Austin Ford dealerships, too.) Steve had me sit down to get my paperwork started, and shortly thereafter, we test drove the vehicle I wound up buying. (I told Steve what I told a lot of the sales reps: my first reaction upon driving my first 2012 F-150 back in October was, wow, I didn't realize that Range Rover was making Ford trucks. These babies drive like a dream.)

The Russell & Smith dealership deserves high praise for how they treated me. The head honcho Simon presented a deal to me that was, in fact, a better price by far than the deals I was able to finesse in Austin, even after lengthy negotiations. In fact, I accepted his offer with out countering it.  Their finance guy DJ Scroggs earned high praise from me too, a great big ex-college football player with a great personality and people(and number) skills.  There were no 11th hour surprises, no shady legal documents shoved at me, no smarmy, obnoxious attitudes--just a smooth process of filling out the financial paperwork, presenting them with a cashier's check down payment, and driving my dream F-150 off of the lot with my new insurance docs faxed to them and placed in the glove box.

All in all, Steve, Simon and DJ left me with a feeling that I'd closed a deal with good guys, a sharp contrast to the Austin dealership that had me taking back my cashier's check in disgust to my bank, having felt like I'd suddenly been thrust into a snake pit at the final phase of the deal. (I'm hoping that they've had at least one meeting about the man who walked out with his down payment, called, ""How to F**k Up A Closing"".)

In short: if you want to be treated great, experience a painless buying process, and drive away with a fantastic product at a very fair and competitive price, then go to Russell and Smith Ford. These guys represent the best 300 mile round trip I've ever made in my life.  You can't really put a price tag on that. Russell and Smith: bravo, guys.  Go see Steve Houtkooter, folks: he's a Marine--and a great guy who will cut you a super deal to boot. Semper Fi.",5.0

I was immidiately captivated by his friendly personality and business ethics, being a Human Resources Professional myself.

He blew my mind that day, when I actually drove the car out of the dealership that same day. Darrell's interpersonal and negotiation skills are Awesome!!

504,"February 26, 2012","My mother previously purchased two vehicles through Russell & Smith and I've previously used the Russell & Smith Service Dept for my Mercury Cougar.  While my mom's purchases were good experiences, it was our experiences with the Service Dept that really sold me on this dealership.  

I cannot stand dealerships who talk down to women - one previous dealer suggested I check with my husband before making a decision.  I know more about cars than my husband, I handle our finances, and it was *my car*, not his.  

At the Russell & Smith Ford Service Dept, I have *never* had this experience.  They talk to me like I'm a whole person.  They explain what's to be done and what the cost will be.  Then they make sure to keep me posted on any updates.  Their customer service is *excellent*.  I've been promising the Service Dept that whenever I bought a new car, I'd be coming back to Russell & Smith... and I did!

We originally went in to purchase a car for my husband, but with both of us actually needing a vehicle, we decided to consider buying two.  Carlos Duca was extremely patient and went out of his way to make sure we got into the cars we wanted, near the price we wanted.  We managed to land on a day when they were short handed, but they did their best to see that everything went as smoothly as possible.

I called and spoke with Carlos Ducas and he provided me the information we needed. We live in Louisiana and we happened to be going to Austin a few days after we found the car for sale on the Internet, so we stopped on our way in Houston and saw the car. Carlos and his brother David were very friendly and helpful on the phone and in person. In 3 hours we went thru the process of purchasing the car. Both my husband and I drove the vehicle, negotiated, agreed on a couple of minor things the car needed fixed. Then, David called a Louisiana‚Äôs car dealership to get information on taxes and did the paperwork for the car, we paid and left (we did not use their financing services). David even recommended a great place to eat. A few days later on our way back, we stopped and picked up the car. Carlos called us to tell us the car was ready to be picked up. When we arrived, the vehicle was clean and the minor things that we had agreed upon had been taken care of. We left with the vehicle after a short stop. R&S sent us the registration, the license plate and title to our home. Overall we have been very satisfied with our experience at Russell and Smith and with the professional care we received from the Ducas brothers. We definitely would buy another vehicle from them.

me for anything else and even the man who evaluated my trade in was courteous. The

517,"November 09, 2011","I was referred to Darrel Babineaux by a friend who had recently purchased her second vehicle from him.  I was afraid that no one, especially a ""major"" dealership like Russell & Smith, would give me the opportunity to rebuild my credit.  First let me say that during past auto purchases I recall spending the entire day at a dealership, only to have nothing accomplished and having to come back the next day, and the next day!  I called Darrel while I was at work one day, told him my story and gave him all of my information over the phone.  Less than 24 hours later I was at Russell & Smith test driving the vehicle that I would later that day call my own!  The experience I had as I sat with Anthony Alexander to sign all of the finance paperwork, was equally as awesome!  He made sure that I was taken care of AND got my note wayyyyyyy below the payment that I expected it to be!!  Since my purchase I've been back to Russell & Smith a few times, to pick up my plates, to visit the service dept., etc, and Darrel has continuously given the extraordinary customer care that he did from the moment I first spoke with him!!!

Even though the issue was very troubling and not the fault of Russell and Smith, they went out of their way to make it as positive as they could. Steve L. the general manager even went so far as to cannibalize the new part from a Fusion Hybrid that had just arrived on their lot because it was going to take two weeks to get the part from Ford. Joshua Parker the sales manager made sure that we had a vehicle to drive during all of this and even put tinting on our new car at no cost to us and sold us an extended warranty at a reduced cost. Chris Alverez our salesperson was very attentive and worked with us in every way that he could. Service adviser B J Villereal was very professional, courteous and helped us get our car back as soon as it was possible.

520,"October 30, 2011","I have never liked car salesman and my first trip to a dealership this time actually made that felling even more like an STD. I was so unhappy I was about to switch from looking for a Mustang to anything that didn't say Ford. Then I received a call from Carlos Duca and Russell and Smith Ford and yet I was not turned at that time there was something I liked about Carlos and agreed to go by and meet him. Now I had already sent Carlos the description of the car I wanted. When I arrived once again I was set upon by salesmen like I was a dying carcass and they were buzzards. Now from that point until I went to the body shop I had the most positive experience looking for and buying my Ford Mustang. 1) Now my first thing I was surprised about was the buzzard that was circling outside took his first peck and when I told him who I came to see he went straight inside and Paged Carlos. Russell &amp; Smith Ford 4 points for friendly &amp; customer service** 2) It took me longer to get there than planed and even though I was 10 minutes late I when I came in Carlos made me wait less than the usual wait. Carlos 5 point's*** never make the customer wait. 3) Carlos found the exact car I sent him a description about to the tee, Carlos 5 points*** first time I had a salesman prepare for my arrival. 4) Carlos never tried to lead me away from that car like any of the salesman I had dealt with just because the car I wanted was not on the lot. Then half way the night it was like stepping in cow ____; I never had to interject myself into the conversation because I was doing all the talking and Carlos was listening another shock as I made no commitment by that time to lead him into thinking I was even interested in walking out with a new car that night. Carlos 5 points*** actually listening to a customer, making them realize you are not car selling robot but a true human being that is doing excellent job in profession that might out breed Dr's in the number that are ass_____. 5) Lastly when I did ask to see what he had on the lot he did not take me to something not even close to what I wanted because the only match between inventory and my description was the size of the Motor but to a car that I would not only be happier with than what I asked for as it is closer to my dream car (Shelby GT500 that needs no upgrades just a price break by Ford)and the speed of which he got me out the door when I asked to buy the car while getting me upgrades to the car that cost more than the difference between what I wanted to pay and R &amp; S wanted me to pay. Carlos 5 points*** sell the customer a car they will be happy with and earn return business not a car that will remind the everyday the settled for something they really didn't want. ***Upgrades*** Louvers and side scoops chance for bonus 3 points Carlos didn't call me on the day they were to be installed but pulled out a 4.89 points on effort and getting what the customer wanted when I showed up after work and at the body shop Benny gave me 5 point service, but the guy who installed the parts brought it down to a 3 when he did not use a paper floor mat and left foot prints in my 9 day old dream car. 
27 out of 30 points on my Q &amp; S scale so yes I would recommend Russell and Smith and recommend Carlos 3 times and Benny gets the nod if he remembers that guy doesn‚Äôt get in my car without a floor mat ever, ever, ever, I mean never ever again. The next closets dealership in my book rated 3 out of 30 and they only made the sale because I was buying a truck as you have Nissan trucks and V8 Ford Mustangs if not one or the other might as well walk. Finally I would like to thank God for letting me buy my Mustang and for bring me together with the first car salesman I didn‚Äôt want to call an SOB or push in front of the metro bus. Carlos thanks but don‚Äôt let your head swell up to big or I‚Äôll tell my wife you think her brothers cute, sorry you had to hear her when she got out of the bed on the wrong side but she does that everyday.

There is when Mr. Darrell Babineaux greeted me in such a courteous and professional manner upon arrival.  His professionalism struck me immediately as someone I wanted to do buisness with.  Even though I was considering a new vehicle to satisfy my daughter's wishes, he didn't push in that direction.  He patiently directed me to a used vehicle which was perfect for what I was looking for.  As I had done my homework, the vehicle we test drove, was a bit overpriced, he patiently worked with management to negotiate the price that was suitable for my daughter's budget. 

Soon after, I noticed the car needed some minor repair, which had not been noticed originally.  Two days later, I returned to the dealership, where Mr. Babineaux insisted that Russell & Smith would make it right.  He immediately worked to have it approved for repair, which is VERY unusual for any other dealership, considering it was a ""high mileage"" vehicle.  I was truly appreciative that his efforts and salesmanship prevailed during this transaction.  Most dealerships AND salesmen would have told me it was ""my problem"".  

As I have told the dealership, and Mr. Babineaux, Russell & Smith will have my business in the future, as well as any of my friends or family whom may be shopping for a value, as well as committment to customer service. Darrell Babineaux has my loyalty as a salesman.  This was the BEST experience I've ever had relating to purchasing a vehicle.  Keep up the good work, Russell & Smith, AND Mr. Darrell Babineaux!  


Sincerest Regards....

Darrell discussed with me what I was looking for in a new car an assured me the he would take care of me. I was comfortable working with Darrell and Russell and Smith because they didn't try to strong arm me into purchasing a new car in order to meet a sales quota. I had an issue with financing after leaving the dealership and Darrell listen to my concerns and let the managers know that I was coming back to get it resolved.

547,"September 14, 2011","I had been debating on buying a new car for a couple years (yes 2 years). I am very careful in regards to major purchases.  I decided I wanted a Mustang.  I went to a couple of dealerships but I did not get a comfortable feeling. My last stop was Russell & Smith Ford where my wife and I met Darrell Babineaux. Darrell was very professional and made both my wife and I very comfortable.  He did not come across as someone wanting to make a buck but instead made us feel like he wanted us to make a decision that we would be satisfied with. 

After telling Darrell what I wanted in a Mustang, within a few days, he gave me a call and said he got it! My wife and I returned to the dealership to find a Mustang that exceeded our expectations. Needless to say, we walked out with a new Mustang. Even after our purchase, Darrell has even called to check on both of us. We really appreciated the excellent service he provided. 

The truth is, I am very cautious and patient, so if Darrell had not been our salesperson, I am 99% sure I would not have purchased a new vehicle.

He provided most of the interventions so I did not have to worry about the deal. He was there with me every step of the way. At each step, he told me what was going on and about how long it would take and what was next. He provded me with information on my car choice while I waited. He was very courteous and professional.

I came to Darrel because I has worked with him several years prior and his integrity, excellence and commitment to his customers still availed. Darrel was very honest. He was upfront and told me exactly what could and could not be done. There wasn't any information that I received that was not the truth. I have referred several of my co-workers to Darrel when they are ready to purchase, mainly because of the service he provides. He also provides great follow-through. When it was time for my first oil change I received a reminder email and he contacted me about two or three weeks after my purchase to see if I was still satisfied with my selection.

I will remain a customer of Darrel's when I am ready to purchase my next vehicle. If you are looking for a stress free, honest, customer oriented salesman, you will not be disappointed in Darrel Babineaux.",5.0

553,"September 01, 2011","I purchased a F150 2010 pick up truck this past January 31 from a Sale Consultant by the name of Dave Ulrich.  This was the first time I have purchased a truck and I was very excited and thrilled. Dave is a wonderful Sales Consultant in every way and made my purchase a pleasant experience. Now on the other had - Seven months later after my second oil change and first tire rotation. I noticed that the drive on my truck was riding very rough and that my two front tires were looking worn.  I was concerned and decided to take my truck to NTB Tire Service.  The technician looked at my tires along with his manager and noticed that the front end needed to be looked at.  He mentioned that it could possibly either be the aliment or the struts.  He advised me that since the truck was still on warranty I needed to go back to Russell and Smith and have them take a look at it and see if they could repair the problem, so I did.  I went back to Russell and Smith at the Auto Service Department this past Saturday August 27th and I was greeted by a technician by the name of Daniel Dougley.  He looked at my tires and was very rude and defensive!!  He asked if I had rotated my tires and I told him yes.  After we had said a few rudely words with each other I had ask for the manager. I no longer wanted to deal with him any more and felt I was getting now where with him!! He told me that the Manager would be in on Monday and gave me his manager‚Äôs business card and not his own.  I then took a day off from work and took my truck back to Russell and Smith first thing Monday morning August 29th and asked to speak with Doug Winkler.  Mr. Winkler then took a look at my truck and also asked me the same questions and I gave him the same answer as I gave to Daniel.  I also expressed to him how very unprofessional and rude his technician Daniel Dougley was with me on Saturday. He really did not seem to be very concerned.  Then after Mr. Winkler had one of his employee‚Äôs drive my truck around to the back of the Service Dept. this was probably around 9:30am and told me it would take maybe about two hours or so.  I waited all day in their lobby until about 5:00pm that evening.  No one; not anyone and any time until then came out to give me the status on my truck.  He then said they could not find any thing wrong with my truck and all they could do is just rotated my tires again.  Now! That took almost eight hours for them to tell me that!!!  I‚Äôm very upset and displeased with Russell and Smith and will not recommend any one that I know to ever purchase a vehicle with this company!! I have a warrantee on this truck I feel that they did not honor me that!!  I plan to take this further until a get this matter resolved!

558,"August 07, 2011","Visited Russell and Smith Ford on July 13, 2011 to purchase a Ford F150 - FX2 as seen on Kelley Blue Book. I was greeted by Ron McCollum, who eventually informed me that the vehicles I saw on Kelly Blue book as an error cause the VIN #'s was not matching the F150-FX2 on Russell and Smith's Inventory listing.  Ron McCollum proceeded to show me what he had in stock, which was the closest match to what I wanted.  No FX-2 was in stock at the time, so I looked at the XLT, but Russell and Smith Ford did not have in its Inventory a F150 with the features I wanted, so Ron introduced me to Jose Molina, who gave me a print-out of a vehicle which met my needs and indicated that Russell and Smith Ford will match the Price I was getting at Champion Ford Katy (who had a vehicle with that met my needs).  Based on the print-out and the agreed price I proceeded to sign a Agreement to Purchase with Russell and Smith Ford (I still have my copy). They initially offered me financing, and I informed Ron and Jose that I am purchasing the vehicle ""cash"" as I am a new resident to the US and I have no credit history, at that time they informed me that I will be given an extra $1,000.00 off the list price with financing, I refused.  On my way out the door I realised the Agreement to Purchase Document stated a different VIN # to the Print-out, Both Ron McCollum and Jose Molina assured me the vehicle with the VIN # shown on the Agreement to Purchase document had the same features and accessories as the one on the print-out.  I googled the VIN # when I got home, only to realise that the vehicle with the VIN # as stated on the Agreement to Purchase document was totally different to the one on the print-out.  I called Ron McCollum the next day and informed him of this and the phone calls started going back and forth with with both Ron McCollum and Jose Molina with respect to Russell and Smith Ford securing a vehicle as per our finalised Agreement to Purchase.  Jose Molina kept calling to let me know that they found a match but always advise that it would cost me between $800.00 to $1500.00 extra to get the vehicle to Russell and Smith Ford .  I refused to pay extra for what was agreed and signed on July 13, 2011.  Eventually, Russell and Smith Ford had advised me, through Jose Molina, that they could NOT deliver the agreed vehicle and I should look elsewhere and my Agreement to Purchase would be cancelled, I requested an email confirmation of this, which I got.

I got a couple emails from Russell and Smith Ford in the couple weeks after my experience with them, informing me of that the sales representative was no longer with the dealership ..... what a crock!!!! ..... called Russell and Smith, today (August 6, 2011), and both Jose Molina and Ron McCollum is still at the dealership.

I got a letter today stating that I was refused credit by Russell and Smith Ford, which is very confusing to me as I did not obtain credit from this dealership.

I eventually purchased a Ford F150-FX2 at Champion Ford, Katy.  Enjoying my ride.

I had a small problem after I took delivery (completely my fault) but Dave drove across town to help me and I was on my way in five minutes. I didn't expect that.

Dave took his time to answer my questions. Unlike many dealers he let me take a real test drive to make sure I would be happy with the car.

The paperwork went quickly and smoothly (I didn't finance) and there was no pressure to buy all of the extras that I have experienced at other dealers.

I was going to visit another dealer until I read the reviews here about Russell-Smith Ford. The ratio of positive to negative was better than the other dealers I was considering so I decided to visit Russell-Smith first. I am so glad I did.

603,"March 06, 2010","As our old cars had reached the falling apart stage we had to buy 2 new cars recently.

We went for the hybrids.  I work in the oil and gas industry and know full well that  with China selling more new cars last year than the US that there will be tremendous stress on worldwide demand for petroleum.  Prices are relatively cheap right now with the global slowdown but man I wanted a fuel efficient car.  Plus it helps with abatement of anthropogenic global warming.

Carlos was very knowledgeable about hybrids, shares our concern for the environment.  This is why I wanted to deal with him the second time.  

He got sick the second time we bought a car but his team helped him with the particulars of our deal during his absence.

We have had the Escape hybrid now for a little over 7 months and we have been getting 35.2 mpg during the winter driving for 2400 miles around the city.  I really like that car.  Without naming brand names every time I see this very little car in the school parking lot I find it funny that we are getting better mileage in an SUV rather than that particular 2 seater!

My only complaint is that since Ford is pretty much able to sell all the hybrids they make they should make more of them.  I wanted the intermediate option package for our new Fusion, for example, with the excellent safety equipment, but had to get the leather seats (yuk... how enviro-unfriendly) and navigation system we didn't really want.",4.8

I had very nice experience buying my New Ford Focus 2010 SEL at this dealership. They gave me first quote itself on internet with good rebate and later I got MD Anderson discount also.

I called the finance and salesperson I dealt with, only to learn that all of the paperwork had been filed and there was no way to stop the loan at this point and that I was likely stuck unless I could get the bank to stop the loan.  Upon contacting the bank, I was told that could not do anything until there was an actual loan number.  I waited a week and received my payment coupons from the bank and called to see how to cancel the loan.  I was told the only way was to pay it off or to call the dealer and have them refund the money and redo the loan, but that would be the dealership's call to make.  I spoke with J.R. Shaw and he said he would talk to the finance manager John Juarez and indicated it should not be a problem.
