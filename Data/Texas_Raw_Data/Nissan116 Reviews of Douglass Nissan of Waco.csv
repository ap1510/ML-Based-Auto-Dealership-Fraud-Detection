109,"April 17, 2014","I always have a great experience in the service department.  As a woman, I feel very comfortable there.  One time, they were short staffed & I was given a loaner car for free while they worked on my car...now that's customer service!  Thanks guys!  ",5.0
110,"February 12, 2014",My husband and I have purchased several cars and trucks from Waco Nissan. We would not go any place else to purchase a car or truck.  We now have three Nissans.  The service department is very helpful with what we need.  We are in and out at oil change time. It is always a pleasure to go to the dealership and visit with all.,5.0

112,"December 02, 2011","I have been trying for days to get in touch with someone in the service department to service my Infiniti, but no one answers the phone. The receptionist is not helpful. I have filled out online forms and emailed, but still have not received any response. Unfortunately, I am giving up on trying to have my Infiniti serviced here and will be going to Toyota instead.

114,"June 29, 2009","I bought a Versa there a year ago.  The price was very fair, the process was efficient, and everyone was friendly.  I've been car shopping many times, and been to places that were shady.  In my experience, this was in my top two or three car shopping experiences.",4.8
115,"May 12, 2009","This place is nothing but crooks. I bought my first car here and was totally taken advantage of. I received one quote by email, on the same car VIN by the same sales rep. When I return to the dealership to finalize the sale, they shuffled the numbers and stuck it back up at MSRP. I forgot to bring the copy of the email with me with my price quote, and it was 6pm on a Friday, I was moving that following Sunday. I had no options left and signed, a $3000 mistake. Oscar Reyes was the sales guy and I don't remember the guy who drafted the paperwork.

Both shady...he claimed he didn't have a copy of the email he sent me. They get you in a crunch then totally take advantage of you. If you want a good deal on a car, go to Dallas or Austin, this place is crooked.",1.8
