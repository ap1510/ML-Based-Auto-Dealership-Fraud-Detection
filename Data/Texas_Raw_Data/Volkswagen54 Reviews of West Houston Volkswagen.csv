0,"June 26, 2020","I waited a week to write this review, and all I can say is THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU to Russ Ali and his team. I literally texted Russ on Thursday evening about a convertible I wanted, and by Friday lunch, I was signing papers and getting ready to drive out my vehicle. If you are looking to buy a car in Houston, even if it's not a VW, call Russ Ali first. Why?
1) He's super honest and direct: this was my first car and he gave me all of the details I needed to make an informed decision. He knew I had a demanding job so didn't play the ""tricks"" or put unnecessary pressure on me. He made what is usually a stressful process super easy.
2) They are all about quality: my car is 2016 but looks brand new. I can tell that they pride themselves on offering solid cars and I am forever grateful
3) He cares: he took time to listen to my situation and concerns. He made sure I found something that was within my budget, my style, and safe / reliable. He also gave me advice and guidance on not only the car buying process but everything else. He knew that I wanted to show my parents the car so patiently waited for me to get their opinion before finishing
4) The whole team is amazing: buying a car during a pandemic is not easy for anyone, and they showed me and my family so much compassion and care. From sanitizing / wearing masks to reducing my need to do any extraneous tasks or jump through unnecessary hoops, every member of the staff was a pleasure to work with.
5) Transparency: There were no hidden costs or bait and switch. He honored what he advertised and was transparent about what deals / specials he offered other customers which I appreciated.

It's really hard to put into words how amazing the team at West Houston VW is but I'll close with this: no matter where I go or what I do, I have a feeling I'll be getting any and all of my cars from West Houston VW from now on.

1,"December 26, 2019","West Houston VW had a vehicle I was interested in purchasing; I contacted them through their website, where they ask you to do so for today’s best price; I did so and I included the fair price I was ready and willing to pay; I received a follow up phone call from Matt Nazar stating they don’t negotiate over the phone or email for fear of being undercut by another dealer—that seemed reasonable; he suggested I come out to the dealership, so, I scheduled a meeting day/time. I was told they would have the car outside ready to review and drive; that didn't happen, the car was on the showroom floor when I arrived, and I was told something I thought very odd for a car dealer...  “they don't allow test drives before purchasing”.  
They also told me they are the #1 VW dealer in the state, their website says family owned and operated… we treat you like family… truly committed to having Really, Really Happy Customers, etc., yet, they don’t allow test drives before you purchase one of their automobiles.  So much for treating customers like family or being committed to having Really, Really Happy Customers, etc. Hopefully VW North America can confirm to me their status as #1 and the policy of not test driving a car before purchase. In the meantime, here’s one cash buyer who will not recommend West Houston VW to my family, friends, employees, customers or their friends and family, etc.  Can you imagine not test driving a car you want to buy?  Me either.

2,"November 06, 2019","We bought a new Volkswagen in October.  Lorie helped us thru the whole process.  She was very patient and professional.  We test drove few different vehicles. Lorie rode with us, explained the functions thoroughly and answered all of our questions.     We purchased the car the same afternoon.  The finance person was very nice also.

3,"November 01, 2019","I will try to make this as succinct as possible as my unabridged story is a long one.  I purchased a second VW Golf at WHVW (11/17/17) the first flooded in Hurricane Harvey.  Eduardo was the salesman for both…Good guy.  They took it to the back for washing and presale inspection (shown on invoice).  After completing paperwork, I went out to drive off the lot.  Prior to driving off I did a walk around and found a fairly savage door ding with associated paint damage (to the metal) that was not there 30 min prior (after a presale inspection, mind you).  They supplied me with a loaner and had their body shop do the repairs.  I picked up some days later and drove off (11/24/17).  Noticed a vibration about the car as though a wheel was out of balance and assumed that it was the textured or uneven concrete of the highway but later recognized it wasn’t the pavement.  I brought it back in a few days because of a fuel door that wouldn’t close properly (11/28/17).  I explained the vibration to the service guy (Reginald) he drove it and said he could not feel the vibration.  I asked if he had checked the wheel balance as requested, he then asked the guys in the back to check the balance.  Said one was out “a little” holding his fingers to show a little.  I drove off and continued to feel the vibration as before.  This went on for my 10k, 20k, and 30k scheduled maintenance, each time bringing up the vibration.  The 10K scheduled service invoice does not show that I mentioned the vibration.  However, It does mention that the “Next Service recommended 70 k 6 cyl Touareg”  (which I do not own).  But, I recall bringing it up with (Nicole 6/9/18).  All in all, I ended up with two “wheel balancing’s”, one 4 corner “alignment” two rotations and three to four test drives.  Each time they denied feeling the vibration, yet all of my friends could feel a vibration.  I moved to another city and took it to the Abilene, TX dealership ASAP.  The service guy said he could definitely feel the vibration and put the car up on a rack.  He found a bent rim and a “very” out of balance wheel (.75 inner/1.50 outer).  He balanced the wheel and the vibration was almost removed but I could feel the out of true rim.  The Abilene service representative also said that an alignment didn’t appear to be performed on the car as he showed me the factory markings across the nuts demonstrating that they were not turned since initial assembly.  In addition, there were no tool markings on the nuts and such.   So, these folks at WHVW stated they performed a wheel alignment, by the evidence available to me and a service mechanic (in another city) with 17 years of experience, no alignment was done.  It also appears that no balancing was done or they would have noticed and remedied the out of balance and bent wheel.  It seems as though the inventory at WHVW is mishandled, as I had a significant door ding and a bent rim at the time of purchase.  I identified the door ding but did not identify the wheel problem till I went to another dealership which noticed quickly.  BTW, I had the rim fixed at Wheel of America in Houston (Great shop!) and now the ride is as smooth as silk.  Also, I have all my service paperwork from WHVW to back up my story.  Most of the folks at WHVW seem quite nice but something is amiss in the service department and I really hope it doesn’t run anywhere else.  I called Corporate explaining my issue to them.  Corporate said that they would forward my issue to WHVW and that since most/all VW dealerships are franchises there was little more that corporate could do.  I asked the young woman at Corporate VW (customer care, I think) if this was it??  Is there anything else that was going to be done, like a refund of the services that arguably were not done.  She said well, I could call you and let you that WHVW received the forwarded complaint.  I said ok and thanks for hearing me out.  Have not heard from anyone at VW so I have to decide to write a review outlining my experiences at WHVW.",2.0
4,"August 29, 2019","Been going to this place for over 5 years, thought they were ‘a little’ expensive but obviously happy enough with the service. However 2 days ago I was told my crankshaft was worn and presented with a $2500 invoice. I told them I had a power train warranty on this car. Hi he warranty company obviously doesn’t want to pay up and now I’m being told they just needed to top up the oil and things should be ok!!! Without warranty I would have trusted the technician and paid up $2500 for what’s apparently an oil top up!!!!!

Needless to say I don’t trust a word they say anymore and I’m questioning the $9000 (!!!!) worth of invoices I picked up from them over the last 6 years.........

When asked what they can do for me the answer from the Service Manager (Chris) was quite simply ‘nothing’, please pick up your car with topped up oil and return the loaner.....

This weekend I need to go to Dallas and they obviously want to use me as a guinea pig to see if the car is driving ok now.....

I’ll rent a car for the weekend (not taking that gamble with 2 kids in the back) and will never ever return to this dealership (except maybe to talk to the GM and see what he thinks).

I’m from Europe and I was always told customer service in the US is great.....well it definitely isn’t at VW West Houston.....going from a $2500 invoice to an oil top up......SHAMBLES!

6,"July 18, 2019","Service/parts Manager (I only use manager in the sense it is his official title - not how he handled the situation) CHRIS, is nowhere near having the attitude of a manager very rude basically saying Im lying about having bought my Vw car battery there because to begin with it has some letters on it that only They should have possession of. The battery just lasted a little over a year and a half and that is why I am going back to get a replacement. He didn’t even bother checking his system to find a receipt for us since we don’t have it... he kept saying nobody of his employees could have sold it to me so again he was insinuating that I stole it from there?! We gave him specific month and year when we bought it so he can check his cameras or his system easily, for proof, but something was keeping him from even wanting to check. He says his cameras can’t go back two years and there was no way he could find a receipt in his system for 2017... with this technology it is impossible to believe. It has been such a bad experience after being a customer year after year to get our oil changes since we bought our VW. Something is very fishy in that location.. his face said it all. Won’t ever go back. ",1.0

10,"September 17, 2018","Because my current lease with VW is expiring in September 2018 I started looking to enter a new lease in July.
I have a 2015 Passat Limited Edition leased from VW Clear Lake, where I live by, and have been very happy with it.
I test drove a 2018 Passat SE and liked it a lot, but the price presented was a lot higher than I wanted. So I searched internet hoping to get a better price. 
West Houston VW’s sales rep Saad Rahmani contacted me by email and text. After I explained to him what I was looking for and my budget, he said he could get close to my current lease price, which is $300 per month for 36 months lease with $0 down, on a Passat S, a Jetta or Tiguan Limited. He invited me to see him.
I drove one hour from Clear Lake to West Houston VW in Katy to meet him on 7/31. After going through the same old sales negotiation acts a few rounds for 2 hours, I signed the lease for a Tiguan Limited S for $305 per month for 48 months because I trusted his words that this was the best price I could ever get that they were losing money on this deal.
I had to drive away the new Tiguan Limited and left my Passat in their parking lot because I could not drive two cars at the same time. 
I could not wait to tell my colleague about the exciting new car but was only shocked to learn that her family leased a 2018 Tiguan SE from the same dealership in February for $258 per month for 36 months with $1650 down only. 
I expressed my shock and disappointment to Saad three days later when I went back to the dealership to pick up my Passat. He said because each month the incentives given are different also interest rates have been going up I should not compare these two prices this way and I really got the best deal. I told myself to trust his words again. 
However, the real shock came a few weeks later when I visited VW Clear Lake on 9/6 to discuss options for my expiring lease on the Passat - I learned that day that Tiguan Limited requires “Premium Gas Only”! Nobody at West Houston VW ever told me that Tiguan Limited is a “Premium Gas Only” car and I have been filling with regular gas into it! Most important, I would definitely not have leased it if I had been told it requires “Premium Gas Only”. 
On 9/7 the next day, I called West Houston VW and asked to speak with the GM and left him a voicemail.  I also drove there on the same day to make a complaint and request to terminate the lease. Shane Hubbard, the Sales Manager, accepted me. 
His defense was that sales reps are not required to disclose this information because not every customer cares about if a car requires regular or premium gas. I could not agree at all. 
I asked him if so why all the stickers list fuel economy information in bold letters? It’s because it is one of the most important information and material enough to affect consumer’s purchasing decision. Plus, Tiguan Limited is not a luxury car which consumers would naturally assume and use premium gas. Moreover, Tiguan requires regular gas, not premium gas, so Tiguan Limited’s “Premium Gas Only” requirement is an exception, not a norm or common sense, so should be disclosed to buyer during the sales process. 
Shane then said even though it says “Premium Gas Only” it does not mean you cannot drive the car with regular gas – I could not believe what I heard and asked him if he suggest I keep using regular gas? What if there is a problem later? Who will take the responsibility? Will the warranty be honored? He said he just does not think putting in regular gas will cause problems. 
He said the dealership can do nothing about the lease because I signed the contract and it is now between me and the VW credit. I can make a complaint to VW manufacture if I like. 
I reported this issue to VW Credit on 9/10 and they referred me to VW Customer Care. The complaint was filed. 
VW Customer Care called me back the next day on 9/11 saying that they had forwarded my complaint to West Houston VW and the GM said the sales rep said he did go through with me all the details about the car. 
Of course, this was a lie, in regard to the “Premium Gas Only” information. 
I was told that they will ask the GM to call me to discuss more if I would like. I said yes please ask him to call me. 
But up to now, no one called me from West Houston VW.

20,"January 02, 2017","Let me separate this review into two sections should anyone from West Houston VW care to read this and or respond.  This is a long, but detailed and thorough review.

I recently purchased a 2017 VW Golf Alltrack S from this dealership just before Thanksgiving 2016.  After going through their sales process and now just attempting to do my ""complimentary follow up appointment"" (more on that in a minute) to make sure I was completely satisfied with my purchase, here are my thoughts:

***SERVICE***

Fast forward a little over a month to today when I was scheduled for my ""complimentary follow up"" service appointment.  Prior to today, I had called and verified my license plate and registration/inspection sticker had arrived.  Given that I needed to setup the new plate with the toll road authority and they showed to possibly be closed Monday Jan. 2nd for the New Years holiday like I was, I went by Saturday Dec. 31st to pickup my plates and note with Service a few things I had noticed to be checked.  Picking up the license plates was easy enough and I installed them myself without any issues.  I then spoke to a service advisor gentleman about my three issues/questions that I would like checked at my appointment Monday Jan. 2nd at 10 AM that Kyle in sales had setup for me a month previously when I purchased the car.  These three items were: one, a rattle had developed in the rear of the vehicle; two, the car for the first 1k miles or so sometimes had issues deciding between 1st and 2nd gear during acceleration, which when it occurred I used a scan tool I own to check for any codes and received  varied intermittent codes thrown that I logged to show service at the next visit as turning the car off and then back on seemed to temporarily fix it; three, the dash making a motor whirring noise in the dash for a minute or two everytime I shut the car off, which I believed to be probably normal given it's frequency and consistency but was curious as to what it exactly was.

The gentleman quickly noted my comments and stated my appointment was set and that I was assigned to Nicole Benoit.  Happy to have provided this updated information so as not to blind side  Nicole two days from now on Monday, I went home.

I returned and pulled into the service drive Monday promptly at 10 AM with right at 2500 miles on it mostly highway from my 60 mile commute previously mentioned.  I then walked in and stood in front of Nicole at her desk.  I was given a subtle glare and no greeting initially.  She looked, as best as I could tell, like she was already very stressed, frustrated, and tired even though service had only been open 3 hours since 7 AM.  No matter, everyone  has their off days and or things to deal with.  I provided my name with which she checked and could not find me in the system.  She then broadened her search and found my appointment had somehow been moved to tomorrow, Tue. the 3rd at 10 AM.  This wouldn't work as I would be at my job which is on the opposite side of town.  I calmly explained that the appointment was setup over a month ago.  She replied roughly that she wasn't sure what happened but there was nothing she could do, and that the best that she could do was try to squeeze it in sometime that afternoon.  As I intended to wait on my vehicle, this wouldn't work as I had other errands to run that day.

She then began going through my short list trying to explain that due to my car being a brand new model, it required a specialized tech to diagnose and repair it.  Furthermore, she continued to say that any of the rattle issues would be charged to repair.  I tried to explain that I was told the point of the follow up appointment was to address any concerns with this BRAND NEW CAR I had just purchased.  You don't need a specialized tech to find and fix a rattle, not taking into account everything in this new model is reused from other models that have been around 2-3 years now.  Nope, was sternly told to basically pound sand and wait all day or reschedule with no sincere apology or the like.  Additionally, she stated that the complimentary visit was for and I quote ""people and cars with, like, 200-300 miles, not 2500"".  When I asked that I thought VW, like pretty much every manufacturer, offers a 12k mile or 1 year basic bumper to bumper to address things like this not including wear items, she responded flatly ""nope"".  I will have to go back and double check my owners manual to confirm, but that's just a rotten deal either way considering my last two hyundais had a few rattles that were promptly and immediately fixed without issues.  Might I add that through this whole process there wasn't a smile or concern, just frantic frustration shown.  At this point, I couldn't wait all day and did not know a good date to reschedule, not that it would appear to matter anyway, so I just cancelled the appointment and left.

So, for Service I give them a 1 star since I couldn't get past the wall of Nicole Benoit to even attempt to receive services in the first place.  Maybe she should consider taking some time off to cool down before she chases away a good amount of business.  Checking Google reviews, it would appear I am not the only one that has received this level of disservice from her.  Oh well, as for me, I will take my service business to another dealership in town.",1.0

After going through their sales process and now just attempting to do my ""complimentary follow up appointment"" (more on that in a minute) to make sure I was completely satisfied with my purchase, here are my thoughts:

***SALES***

I worked with Kyle Ford who I would rate at 4.5 stars for his work and service for me during the entire sales process.  This dealership seems to pride itself on it's own researched discounted best value when you look at their car listings.  I apprecieate that this discount's fine print is placed on the bottom of their website to further detail how they ""give"" you this discounted price.  Unfortunately, it can be gray and vague enough to almost mislead as in my case, but that's part of the new car purchase negotiation.

Moving past that, Kyle provided great communication and assistance with everything needed from setting up the appointment, to test driving the cars, to talking numbers.  The only small let downs were two things.  One, when I showed I was serious about purchasing and asked to see a full breakdown, I kept getting the same generic price sheet that simply read MSRP, discount, TT&L, Final Price and then some generic terms that he admitted were based on average credit for financing even though, by his request, I had pre-submitted my information to be pulled/checked ahead of coming in to have all my real numbers ready to show me their best shot.  It wasn't until 3 attempts later with the same generic sheet of numbers that the Sales Manager came in (can't remember his name at this time) who finally showed me the breakdown sheet I had been asking for saying that the sales staff weren't allowed access to that, only managers.  I'm sorry, but I thought y'all were a ""Sales Team""?  If that were the case then he could have come in a lot sooner and saved some time.  I was up front about looking at both lease and purchase options as well as that I average a 60 mile commute a day.  I required seeing this number breakdown sheet because, Two, they extremely low balled my trade in.  While I know dealers of any kind will try to shoot low for a trade in so they can make a profit, $5-6k off the suggested resell for a dealer was very steep.  Fortunately, we worked that issue out to, but it still added additional time to the entire process unnecessarily.

Kyle did make up for it at the end a bit by working with me to schedule my ""complimentary follow up"" appointment for Jan. 2nd 2016 when I was off from work for the New Year.  At this point I had been at the dealership almost 6 hours and was running behind to meet family for dinner, so he quickly helped me with the basics of the car and I left.  All things considered, Kyle himself, was great and I would buy from him again as it appears most of the issues I ran into were the typical car sales tactics that are more likely pushed down from upper management than within his control.",4.2
22,"November 07, 2016","I lost $6,000 purchasing a used car here. 
I'm just going to let my experience speak for itself. Hopefully this helps some other people. Skip to the last paragraph if you want the final conclusion without the detailed narrative.
I recently bought a car at West Houston Volkswagon Dealership (Saturday, 10/29/2016). The car was a 2008 Nissan Rogue SL with 81,000 miles on it. Prior to purchasing the vehicle, I specifically stated that I did NOT want to buy a car that had been in an accident. The salespersons assured me that the vehicle I was looking at had not been in a wreck or accident, and showed me the Carfax documentation, which matched his description. The original sticker price of the vehicle was $8,900, but they sold it to me for $8,125. 
On Tuesday (11/1/2016), just three days after purchase (and no driving incidents of any sort), I had to take the car to a mechanic because it was making a weird “clanking” noise. After performing an initial evaluation, this independent mechanic stated that the car had obviously been in a wreck of some sort.  He showed me that there were multiple new parts beneath the car that had already been replaced - parts that under normal wear and tear do not need replacing by 81,000 miles (if at all). Though he mentioned that other things needed fixing, the main piece this mechanic recommended repairing was the crossmember, with an estimated cost of $2,500. 

Immediately after receiving this news, I drove straight to the dealership and asked to speak with the manager (or someone in a position to help me) and that I wanted to return the car. They stated that only the manager could help me, and that he was gone for the day and would not be back until Thursday (11/3/2016). When I confronted the car salesman who sold me the car with what the mechanic had found, and reminded him that I had purchased the car only because I believed it had not been in an accident, his only response was, “I don’t know, I am only the car salesman,” and that they “only go by Carfax.” 
I waited two days until Thursday morning and called the dealership again, but was only able to talk to two people who said they would let the manager know and that he would call me back. I never got a callback that day, and when I tried calling again at different times (in case no one was available the first time), no one would pick up the phone, and I couldn't leave a message because the voice mailbox was always full. 

I called again on Friday (11/4/2016) and again asked to talk to the manager. They transferred me to a man who was not the manager (though possibly an assistant manager). After listening to my story, he started laughing and said, ""To be honest with you, you will never be able to speak to the manager - he is a very busy man."" I'm going to assume that he was laughing out of embarrassment, and not because he found my distress amusing. He did give me a phone number that he said was his boss’s manager, which I called and left a voicemail containing my contact information and a request for the recipient to return my call. I am still waiting to receive a callback. 
Later that same day, I took the car to yet another mechanic for a more in-depth analysis. On top of the crossmember, he found even MORE issues, a few of them included the transmission and struts. His final conclusion was that if he finds one more thing wrong with the car, he would simply recommend that I get ""rid of it,"" and that it wouldn't be worth over $2,000 as a trade-in. Given what I'd already paid for this car, I was upset. 
I drove to the dealership on Saturday evening (11/5/2016), hoping to speak directly with the manager and get some sort of mitigation for the loss I've incurred, and one of the (assistant?) managers simply told me ""this is an isolated incident"" and ""there is nothing we can do for you."" My case is simply not important enough to warrant the manager's time.  I also requested a copy of all of the paperwork that I had signed because I realized they hadn’t given them to me at the time of purchase.  This manager stated that he “did not have access to them” at that time because they were “in a cabinet,” and that I would have to follow-up with him again the following week in order to retrieve them. So, I basically have to drive to the dealership again just to get the forms that I should have been given the day I purchased the vehicle.    
I am very unhappy.  The cost of additional essential repairs to the car that I purchased for $8,125 at the West Houston Volkswagon Dealership is so high that the independent mechanic didn’t think they were worth making, but if I trade it in now, the most I may get for it is $2,000.  I basically just lost $6,000 (and that's not even counting my time spent and the independent mechanics' fees I incurred while figuring all this out).  This dealership has access to their own mechanics, and I can't believe that when they processed the vehicle before putting it up for sale, that they somehow missed the (to a mechanic) blatantly obvious fact that this vehicle sustained extensive (and expensive) damage in some sort of accident that did not make it onto the Carfax history.

25,"June 15, 2015","PLEASE DON’T LET THE 4.6 STAR RATING FOOL YOU – THAT ONLY APPLIES TO SALES – NOT THE SERVECE DEPARTMENT!!!!!  First and foremost if I could have given them negative five stars I would have. After completing maintenance to my vehicle,  VW went against my wishes (as I had given them in previous services) and washed my car.  I came to pick up my vehicle and found it covered in soapy residue from the car wash.  While this didn't anger me, it frustrated me - isnt the goal to clean the car, not leave it dirty?  What did anger me was when I opened my trunk later that night, I found TWO 8 in long starches that corresponded perfectly with streak of the soapy reside.  Upon further investigation of my car, I found it littered with these types of scratches.   When I informed West Houston VW, I was told to bring my car in to have it looked at.  What a waste of time, the Service Manager (I only use manager in the sense it is his official title - not how he handled the situation) CHRIS ASSELIN basically called me a liar about the scratches and proceeded to grandstand that his employees (the same ones who washed a car a left it covered in soapy residue) were in capable of this type of incompetent workmanship.  He proclaimed that they used leather chamois to wash the car – even the weekend warrior car wash guy who has watched ONE detailing video knows better because THEY SCRATCH AND LEAVE SWIRL MARKS IN YOUR PAINT. The ONLY reason why they even attempted to rectify the situation was because they didn’t want the negative feedback scores from the survey I submitted.  CHRIS ASSELIN told me to bring in the car, that he would have his make ready team polish out the scratches that there is no way his team caused just to appease me.  When you think polish out, you assume that they are going to remove (or polish out) the trace of the scratches.  NOPE, the either didn’t do a thing, or just put a little wax on the car to try and soften their appearance.  Once I submitted this to VW care, they said our hands are tied and the GM won’t return any correspondence.  So if you are dead set on a VW, NEVER EVER EVER bring your car in to have it serviced.  They will damage your car and leave you holding the bill…VW Care wont do a thing.  YOUR ONLY RECOURSE is litigation….GUESS WHAT West Houston VW – A picture is worth a thousand words. And pictures of the before and after – DO HOLD YOU ACCOUNTABLE for damage to my car …MR. Asselin.    PLEASE BE SMART AND DON’T BUY A VW – Makes Comcast’s Customer Service look phenomenal by comparison.   ",1.0

I grabbed Chris and showed him and and explained to him the windshield was only 2 days old and he said ""there is no way that happened here and im not going to put a new one in""
I know for sure this wasnt there before i went there so later when me and my girlfriend went out she asked how the window got damaged which i knew right then and there it wasnt anything to do with me. I called Buddy the manager of the location and explained what happened to him which he sided with Chris. I told him to pull the camera footage of his service bay and he said they dont have cameras. I asked him if he had a thief for a mechanic or a car fell off a rack or even 3 cars came up missing during the night that he had no cameras to find out who did it?!?! I have NEVER heard of a dealer, especially an established one not having some kind of video survelance! If its true and they dont i would suspect its so they cant be held liable for crap like this! These guys are a total scam i wouldnt go back to this dealership nor refer anybody to it. It sucks i went in for a recall and came out needing a new windshield.

44,"March 02, 2012","This review has been prepared after a 6+ month ownership of 2 VW Golf TDI’s and service experience at West Houston VW. 
I purchased a brand new VW Golf TDI, prior I conducted extensive research, online as well as calling all dealerships within the greater Houston area. Not only was the price set by West Houston VW’s sales manager MUCH lower than all competing dealers, their straight forward and honest approach including all fees and taxes over the phone was a delightful experience compare to the phone tag hassle from the competition.
After arriving, I spoke to internet sales person Doug Atkins, he knew I wanted a Golf TDI, went on a short test drive, and completed the deal within 1 hour. No re-negotiation or hassle. I was in and out of West Houston VW within 3 hours that includes the test drive, some small talk and completing paperwork.
My wife was set to purchase the same car Golf TDI within a few days as well. Same deal BEST price and service from West Houston VW.
Now after a few months of ownership some problems came up that were caused from Houston’s dirty roads, rock shattered the side window that was kicked up by a dump truck, a object destroyed the front fog light.
Both times the car was brought in for service to West Houston VW. Reggie Walker the service Advisor went out of his way to provide proper service in a timely fashion, but also ensured we would receive a loaner car at no charge to us. Something you will not find at the other dealers unless you have warranty work done and they are required to provide a loaner car.
I needed a alignment shortly after, shopped around and found a coupon at a competitors website, called Reggie Walker and he honored the same price. I am stunned at West Houston’s VW service their staff and aim at perfection.
Not everything is perfect in Life and I am certain that is true for West Houston VW as well, but they try very hard to make it right and live up to their slogan “Really really happy customers” , I assure you I am and have not been let down.

I am writing this email as a glowing review for both Nikki and Larry. We just arrived in Austin (from Houston) and they are mostly responsible for allowing it to happen today! Our VW Passat wagon engine light came on today and we were stranded approximately 50 miles west of your dealership. My wife, my two year old daughter and I were finally able to arrive at the dealership with the tow truck at approximately 4pm and were ecstatic to have Larry meet us at the entrance. We were told that we would be unable to obtain a loaner vehicle and that all the rental companies were closed by the time we called. We thought our family weekend vacation would have to be postponed, but Nikki's and Larry's incredible efforts allowed us to take a loaner and to avoid canceling our plans. We are so appreciative and impressed by their efforts that we hope to switch our service to your dealership for our two VW's, even though we live in southwest Houston.
 
Overall, I wanted to make sure that you were made aware of the incredible performances by Larry and Nikki. We feel very strongly that they both went well above and beyond what we expected!",5.0

However, Chris greeted me and offered to process me in so I could be on my way to work. He was very helpful, called me mid morning to give me a progress report and again after lunch to tell me my car would be ready at the agreed upon time. All went smoothly and it was a very positive experience.  This is my third car from this dealership. I keep coming back because the service team acts like you're the only one there. They do their best to make sure they help you with whatever problem you may have or just routine service.

51,"May 10, 2011","What began as a pleasant shopping experience turned into a nightmare! I purchased a used Mazda RX8 from West Houston VW. I was told that the car had been inspected by their mechanics and was in good working order. Less than 48 hours later the “check engine light” (CEL) turned on. I asked the used car salesman if I could bring the car in to have the engine code run to determine the reason for the CEL. I was told that it would be no problem, and that they would take care of it. When we arrived at the location we were told that the car was sold “as is” and that I would have to pay $80 to have the car diagnosed. I took the car to another auto mechanic who diagnosed and fixed the problem. The mechanic had to replace the leaking radiator hoses. Someone had wrapped the hoses with electrical tape to keep them from leaking (what kind of inspection did WHVW perform?). This is not the type of service I expect from any car dealer!",2.0

When the General Manager was contacted for comment, he said ""Well did you have an outside inspector check it over before buying it?"" When one buys from an authorized dealer, one expects the vehicle to be ""OK"", because you believe them to have more integrity than the local ""used car lot"". How many people believe it is necessary to take their own mechanic to the authorized auto dealer? Needless to say, he refused to do anything about the sham that was perpetrated by them.
