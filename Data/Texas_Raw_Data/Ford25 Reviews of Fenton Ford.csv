0,"July 28, 2015","I dealt primarily with Joel on the phone.  When we came to some sort of terms I was passed to Dennis who was supposed to finalize the deal.  I was told that I qualified for a $750 incentive as a veteran, however, when I came in to sign the paperwork and pick up the vehicle Ron initially forgot - then only gave me a $500 incentive.  Did he pocket the $250????

Ron was all ""car dealer"" smoozy and talkative.  He never gave me any paperwork at the time of purchase - promising to Fedex the paperwork the next day. That was on the 9th of July.  I called last week and Ron told me that he forgot and he would make a copy and send it out that day.  Today is the 28th of July, and I still have not received the paperwork from the purchase of my vehicle.

I called and asked that Steve the general manager contact me - he never followed up.  I had to call him back.  I have not reached him yet - so I do not know what their resolution will be - if any............

If you are an out of town buyer - beware!  Their commitment is to their $$ pocket book $$ and not to the customer.

Added 13 Aug 2015: Steve made amends.  Errors were made on the dealers part of this deal.  Fenton Ford mailed me a check for $250 that they failed to give me credit for initilally.  

Joel did a great job during the entire transaction.

Despite a very strong dislike for surveys - I filled one out for FOMOCO also.  It was also negative.

I believe that Steve and the employees @ Fenton Ford will make a better effort in the future.

My initial review stands because in the customer service business usually the first impression is the lasting one.",2.2

4,"April 14, 2015",Found my car on line.  Called the dealership.  Gave them all the info they needed to finance the car.  The next morning my salesman drove 90 mile round trip to pick me up.  Papers were ready to sign when I got there.  Car was detailed and ready to roll.  I am 62 and have purchased many vehicles.  This was the most pleasant vehicle purchase I have ever made.,5.0
5,"March 09, 2015",Went online to find a new 2014 Ford F-150 for my wife and I and seen the great deals that Fenton Ford in Dumas had and made an educated decision and sent an internet request in. Within 5 mins the Internet Manager Ron Garverick called me and was very professional and knowledgeable on the trucks. We worked out numbers online and came to an agreement and Bam! my wife and I made a long trip to Dumas from Dallas. I know people are thinking that wouldn't Dallas have better deals I can admit I thought the same thing at first but nobody came close to Fenton Ford. On top of that everything was ready when we walked through the door. We signed and were back on our way to Dallas within 15 minutes. If you are reading this don't think twice go see Ron and the fine staff at Fenton Ford for your next purchase its well worth it.,5.0
6,"March 08, 2015",Ron Garverick made my experience buying my first car in 20 years an awesome experience!  Not only was he patient with my limited knowledge about purchasing a car in the present but I was ill at the time of buying and he explained every aspect with expertise.  Very friendly and no pressure.  I will take my son to buy his next car to Fenton and plan to share my experience with friends.,5.0

8,"February 24, 2015","This experience has been the best I have had while searching and purchasing a vehicle. My sales rep, Ja'Miah, has been nothing but helpful and courteous. He was never pushy, he is full of knowledge on the vehicles, and he was willing to even extend his hours in order for the transaction to take place. I will recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a new or used vehicle. Not only were the vehicles the best price around, but the customer service is unmatched.",5.0

14,"February 13, 2015",I recently had moved to the OK panhandle and was in search of a good reliable suv. So we started south and came across Fenton Ford to look at a Ford Edge. Once we arrived we were met by Ja'Miah and he was awesome. We drove the edge we wanted to look at and decided that wasn't for us so he had us look at a Ford Explorer. By the end of the day we were the proud owners of a Ford Explorer. The experience was great the customer service that Ja'Miah and the staff provided was great. The service they still provide for us is awesome really make you feel like family. Never had a dealership treat me with respect like Fenton Ford has. Everytime I am in here Ja'Miah always makes it a point to sit down with me and talk if even for a few minutes. ,5.0

19,"January 07, 2015","I first heard about Fenton Ford when I was searching for a F-150 on the internet. I found what I was looking for at Fenton Ford and spoke with Ron, and we we negotiated with price on my trade and new vehicle and was happy with both, even though I live out of state. We drove up from Chicago to purchase vehicle and were shocked when we arrived as to how nice and true to their word Ron and financial staff were. Guess were not used to that being from Chicago :)",5.0
20,"January 07, 2015","I found my new Edge on the internet and gave them a call.  They were more than willing and helpful.  When I did drive the 2 1/2 hours to Dumas, the entire process took less than 1 hour.  I love it and yes, I will return for my next vehicle.  Guarantee!  Thanks Ron Garverick and the rest of the team at Fenton Ford in Dumas, Texas!!",5.0
21,"December 04, 2014","I have a lot of respect and trust in Fenton Ford in Dumas, I bought my first vehicle from Ron at Fenton Ford 3 years ago. Through out the years I have bought 5 more. He is the only person I will go to to buy a vehicle. He is honest, helpful and makes my buying experience as easy and less painful as possible. In and out and I leave with a smile. I recommend all my friends and family to go to see Ron at Fenton Ford. Not just Ron is helpful but the whole selling staff remember who you are when you come in and greet you with a smile. Finance Manager is great goes over the paperwork line by line to make sure we understand what we are paying for. Service is Top notch and I recommend doing your service there also. If I had to rate them 1 being the worst 10 being the best I rate them a 100.",5.0
22,"August 01, 2014","I should have backed out when I went to test drive the car and it wouldn't accelerate, but Ron talked up Fenton like they were all saints that would keep me happy with my purchase. He swore the problem would be fixed and even drove the car to my place of work so I could test drive it again. Before I signed the papers I asked if Fenton would cover some minor repairs-including a ding in the windshield that they should have taken care of in the first place-and I asked if they would cover anything that happened in the next 30 days considering the car wouldn't even accelerate the first time. I got a ""sure, take it to Fenton in Amarillo and they'll take care of you!"" Not the case. Fenton in Dumas refused to pay for the repairs for the problems  that CAME WITH THE CAR. They did ""cover"" the service engine soon light that came on not even two weeks after I bought the thing, which consisted only of resetting it and telling me it probably wasn't a problem. I have a really bad feeling I was sold a lemon. Next time I'll be buying from O'Neals in Amarillo. Great people and they covered car repairs weeks after I bought my other car from them. ",1.6
23,"June 19, 2014","Ron was curtious and knowledgeable when I purchased my 2013 Ford F-150 from them! When it came to service, jayda the service manager exceeded my expectation! Have every intention of buying my next gen F-150 from them! My job makes it difficult to be there at regular business hours and they worked with me on that and met me there when I was able to make it in!",4.8
24,"September 12, 2013","These people are very nice until you buy the car.  They do not clean your new car, they do not wash your new car even though they told you they were going to.  They sale you cars that have things wrong with them.  They will not help you out in any way.  We asked if we could get a    manual for our new car and we were told no they have them on e-bay though. They were all very rude.  They also do not offer you a warranty for used cars.  WORST SERVICE EVER!  ",1.4
