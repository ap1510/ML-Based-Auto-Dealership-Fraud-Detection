1,"June 03, 2019","There is NO service after the sale, so if you had great service when you bought your vehicle, be warned and pray nothing goes wrong, or be prepared to go somewhere else because Hacienda WILL NOT help you. Here goes…Our 2017 Ford Explorer lost the pillar trim on the right side of the windshield while traveling down the highway. My husband made an appointment to have it replaced a couple months ago. He has to actually miss work to get to the appointment. He shows up, and low and behold, after they check his mileage and find out that the car is still under warranty, they tell him they have no record of an appointment, and he will have to come back. HMMMM…he finally arranges to miss work again and makes another appointment. We both show up, they see his appointment, but guess what…NOW it is out of warranty! BIG SURPRISE!!!!! The service tech goes to the manager, who just sits AND HIDES behind the glass wall and does not come to talk to customers…of course the tech comes back and tells us the same thing…no warranty, no help…Oh, the tricks people play. They know how to royally mess with a person and not repair under warranty!!! Well, you would think I would have learned the first time, but no...I guess it takes me two times to get screwed before I learn my lesson, there will not be a third. Off to another dealer, who by the way is helping us with no problem…I am so amazed at how bad the service has gotten at Hacienda…just remember, you have been warned.",1.0
2,"December 27, 2018","12/26/2018 I went to the used car section of the dealership about 4:30 PM. I was looking at a blue Corvette they had for sale. I parked right in front of the used car office. There was 6 salesmen setting and standing around. Two got up and started practicing their football moves. I can plainly see why they are care salesmen. I walked past the group and no one offered to wait on me. I walked out and looked over the vehicle  and then I came back by the office, I was parked if front. One man had moved out to move a black Escalade and another went with him. I started to look at a Shelby 350 but I said what is the use no one here wants to sell a car. If you can't get sales to move I would expect the rest of the dealership to even be worse. One discussed buyer.",1.0
3,"November 03, 2018","I was told I could get a new vehicle and they would waive the charges on my current leased vehicle. I did get a new vehicle and they added the charges anyway. When I confronted them about it, they did not deny it. They actually blamed me for not reading the contract carefully. The GSM said if he could go back that he would change it but that it was to late. Ford Credit told me a way to fix it but Hacienda-Ford  didn’t want to because they would end up loosing money. This shows that Hacienda-Ford doesn’t care about keeping their customers happy. If anyone decides to buy a vehicle from Hacienda-Ford, read the contract carefully and make sure there are no hidden charges.",1.0
4,"July 07, 2018","Service/Body shop experience...HORRIBLE. Took my brand new 2017 Explorer in June 19 after the first storm because it got water in it while sitting in my driveway. No flooding in my streets...just sitting there. They could not find the problem/leak. Told me I must have left the doors or windows open HA! It stayed there during the next storm and got MORE water in it ON THEIR LOT in THEIR CARE. Maybe THEY left the windows or doors open, of course they didn't like it when I turned the tables and asked them that very question. Still could not find the leak, but there is an obvious problem since it filled up more after the next storm. They refused to fix it under warranty because they still couldn't find where the water was coming in so they said it was not a warranty issue...hmmm. To this day...3 weeks later...it is STILL sitting there with water in it...basically rotting in the heat, and do I have a loaner in the mean time...nope! I have asked for a loaner several times and ""nothing is available""! So....stranded for 3 weeks at home with no transportation!!! Luckily I am a teacher and on summer break...not sure HOW I would have been able to get to work if it were during the school year! Unluckily my daughter has had to miss team practices because I cannot get her there. Having called A LOT and been put on hold...their hold message wants all customer to be happy ""If you are not happy we are not happy"" well...I am not happy and this is not 100% satisfaction as your message guarantees!!!

Finally gave up on HACIENDA and FORD and had to call for insurance and guess what...insurance had to call it a total loss because the service/body shop never took the water out AND it should have been a warranty issue since it's only 5 months old! I have only had it since January!!! AND STILL NO LOANER!!! Shame...Not sure what happened but their service has really declined. Now that Hubby is finally off today, we've gotta go get all my stuff out of it before the insurance company takes it to the salvage yard...OH! AND find $500 for the deductible on a problem THEY MADE WORSE! Personally I feel they are at LEAST 50% responsible for the damage since it got worse under their watch, so they should pay for 1/2 if not all the deductible since they could have taken care of the issue day 1 instead of waiting and letting it rot.

We have purchased at least 7 vehicles sent 3 other people to Hacienda...including my parents. We were thinking of trading in our eldest daughter's Fiesta for an EcoSport, - and I will say that the sales team has always done us right - but not sure it will continue to be here if I cannot trust the whole team to take care of us after the purchase.",1.4
5,"February 07, 2018",I have to say that Hacienda Ford take care of you with our question. I bought my F150 here from Raul Gomez the general manager. Raul made me feel very comfortable in choosing the truck as well as closing the deal. I could not have been happier. Now I am back trading this truck in for a new F150. What a smooth and no hassle deal. Thank you Hacienda Ford and a special thanks for Raul Gomez!! A+++,5.0
6,"February 15, 2017","I usually don't give bad reviews unless I get really bad service.  All these people are interested in is selling.  If I buy a 42K car I expect to pay and get the best customer service or at least fair.  I had a problem with my battery after just 2 years, my car wouldn't start so I took off the battery borrowed a car from my mother and went to the dealership.  The guy at the front counter had an attitude and said I needed to take the car to get the battery tested and didn't even bother to look me up in the computer. I am extremely busy all day, I had no choice but to buy a new battery, needless to say I regret doing business with them but I learned my lesson.",1.0
7,"January 24, 2017",The entire staff was excellent. I went in knowing what I wanted and informed them I was in a hurry. Test drove my car and drove off within 2hours! Great job Abiel! ,5.0
8,"October 06, 2016",No matter how many times you go in person or call on the phone you get the run around. In person they say the one I need to talk to is not in. On the phone they hang-up on you or if you get to leave a voice mail they never return your calls. It's the worst dealership to get anything done. I traded my truck in at another dealership just so I don't have to deal with this one.,1.5
9,"August 19, 2016","I got a shelby GT350R 2016 (very rare, just 2 of those so far in the valley area), the front bumper was misaligned, so 2 days after i got it, took it back to get it fix, not only they didn't fix it (was just adjustment) but they got it broke, now it can't be adjusted and is still pop out, broke the wheel well, scratched the red caliper's paint, and made a huge groove into my CARBON FIBER wheel!!
i only asked to get the wheel replaced, but, almost 3 months after the event, they only got it painted!!
they got the ceramic heat shield finish removed, and instead just used regular wheel paint, that place the structural integrity of my wheel at risk, meaning MY LIFE as well!!  just trying to find ways to not be responsible for their own acts! plus, every time i ask to speak to the general manager, its ALWAYS a voice mail.. (left a message urging het to call me back), but no answer so far, same with the service manager...  When the staff of a dealership thinks they are ""above the customers"" that right there is a huge RED FLAG!

10,"May 29, 2015",I have been very pleased with my dealing at Hacienda Ford. We have just bought our 3rd vehicle and are very satisfied with customer service as well as the Ford product. Friendly and helpful. Will buy again from this dealership. . ?,5.0
11,"April 10, 2013","On Feb. 18, 2013, I had my 2006 Ford F150 serviced at Hacienda Ford in Edinburg where it has been serviced for yrs. I had the oil changed fuel and engine air  filters replaced also.
A month later, by accident I discovered that the oil cap was not replaced. Fortunately, I located it. On March 19th, when I found this out I sent an email to Rafael Perez rperez@haciendaford.com telling him about the problem. To this day I have not gotten an explanation or apology.  Now I wonder if the filters were replaced. ",2.2
12,"June 14, 2010","I bought a new car (Ford Focus 2008) I was told I would get new tires.
Today I went (6-14-10) and Hacienda Ford in Edinburgh, Texas broke their
word to me.  I did not get my tires.
I plan to pursue this matter further.  I also will make a report to the
Better Business Bureau.
They have lost me as a customer.",1.0
