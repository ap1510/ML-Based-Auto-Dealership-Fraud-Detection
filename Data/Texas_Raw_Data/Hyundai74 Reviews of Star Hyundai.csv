23,"April 07, 2017","Being a first time buyer I truly didn't think it would be easy. This was my first time working with Star Hyundai of Abilene and I had a wonderful experience. I did extensive research prior to visiting and knew what I was looking for, but was still impressed by the expertise and knowledge that Eric Van Der Vlist brought to the table. Not only did he make the buying experience an enjoyable and seamless one, he helped to structure a great deal that fit our financial requirements. To top it all off, he went above and beyond what I'd consider excellent service to get the deal done. Absolutely amazing!  Can't wait to work with him and Star Hyundai again in the future.",5.0

35,"October 13, 2016","I initially went to a different dealership whom I have previously done business with looking at a Hyundai they had for sale, come to find out it was sold already when I got there. I started looking around online and that's when I found a vehicle on your website that I was interested in. I called the dealership and spoke with JT Whitfill who immediately got to work getting me the info on the car I called about. I went that afternoon and test drove the car and he printed out all of the paperwork for me to take home and show to my husband. I went back the next day and explained to JT how my husband and I preferred to do the financing and how we wanted things to go and I simply got a ""yes ma'am"" from him...no argument or speech about how we needed to do it a different way or go through some other finance or bank. JT even went with me to my bank in case they had any questions or if I needed any info from regarding pricing on the car. After all of this process the bank was not able to get payments on that particular car within the price range that I wanted so JT went back to the drawing board and offered to me other cars and other ways we could still get me a vehicle. I was at this dealership the entire day and he never left me, him and his manager tried all day to get something worked out and sure enough, by the end of the day they had found me a car (a new one by the way which is not what I went there for, but somehow they made it work better than the used one I was looking at) When my husband was finally able to get there JT met with him and caught him up on everything we had going while another gentleman was helping me set up and understand the technologies of the car.",4.8

54,"March 04, 2016","Our experience at Star Hyundai was the absolute BEST!! Our sales person (Luciano Chavez) was excellent! Very personable, very professional, very informed about the vehicle we purchased!  Luciano communicated fully with us, answered all of our questions and stayed in contact with us during the entire process - very important as we are out of town buyers. Cory McGee (used car manager), Jeremy Johnson (sales manager) stayed after hours awaiting our arrival to meet and greet us and help with our purchase!  Luciano came in on his day off to meets us personally and to complete the sale that we started two days earlier. I fully anticipate doing business with this dealership again in the future - the service we received was well worth the drive from the DFW area to Abilene. To clarify, I likely will not have my vehicle serviced at Star - simply due to the distance from my home.",5.0

66,"September 04, 2015","Mr. Chavez is truly an asset to the Star Dodge team in Abilene Texas. My experience there was seamless and educational. Coming from across country it is difficult to find someone personable and someone who you fwel comfortable with. Mr. Chavez listened to my needs and wants and was able to help me get back into a Hyundai. I had a 2001 Elantra previously and sold it for a Nissan and I was never happy with that decision. He made it possible to get back into what I really wanted. Luciano was genuine, he expressed his opinions about my concerns thoughtfully and with care. He allowed me to test drive the car and showed me how everything worked. I felt so special, like I was the only one he was worried about at that time. Mr. Chavez and his team picked up my car from my job, and got the tint done for me. He then brought it back to the parking lot before I even knew it was missing. Back in New York, that would never happen. I feel that Luciano went above and beyond for me and my family, and I cannot thank him enough for dealing with all my questions!!  Luciano is a great salesman but above all a great man, Star is kick to have him on their team. ",5.0
