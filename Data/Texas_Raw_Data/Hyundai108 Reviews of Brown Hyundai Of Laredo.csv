71,"August 04, 2016","Would not even give them 1 star. Our car broke down under warranty on a road trip 1,500 miles from home and had the unfortunate luck of being towed there. They kept the car on the lot, not even looking at it, telling us it would be weeks before it could be fixed, knowing all long our situation of being stranded. Then like vultures, tried to talk us into buying a new car, telling us that ours would never be the same and talking down the FIAT brand while trying to convince us to buy a Hyundai. Being in a desperate situation, we fell into their trap. First they offered a different model than we wanted at the price we wanted. We said no, and they said they will try to get the model we want at the price we wanted. We left that night saying we could come back in the morning and see. They called us less than an hour later saying , Yes they will do the model we wanted at the price we wanted, and to come in the morning and they will have it ready to go and just sign the papers. The next morning they text us to say come in an hour later, that their computer systems are down. Then another text come saying another hour later that the computer systems are still down. When we finally go in, they say that the programs changed and they can not do the deal at that price it has to be much higher. we stormed out and then the manager said that it was a mistake because another customer was looking at that car and that was the deal they qualified for not us. They called and texted the wrong customer, even though they addressed me by name in both the texts and on the phone. They then tried to tell us they could do a deal close to what they already told us, when we said no then they said , ok they will honor the price we all agreed to the day before.  Lies upon lies to cover up their lies. WE refused to give them our business. They Still have not looked at our car in 2 days and all the while telling Fiat they are trying to diagnosis it, when all they are doing is trying to get us to buy a car from them. DO NOT TRUST THEM! Would never recommend them for anything.
