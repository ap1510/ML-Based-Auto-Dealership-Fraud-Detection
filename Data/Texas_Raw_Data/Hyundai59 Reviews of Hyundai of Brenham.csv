0,"March 24, 2020","As a woman buying a car, I have sometimes felt hurried, pressured and ignored when shopping. Here my experience was the opposite. Jake Peery listened to what was important to me, answered all my questions, and remembered it all on my second visit. He is extremely knowledgable and responsive and takes all the time needed to clearly explain all the wonderful things this car can do. I fell in love with the Santa Fe but I also loved the entire purchase experience with Jake, Gregg and Mike. Highly recommend Brenham Hyundai.",5.0

3,"July 08, 2019","Jake Peery assisted me in finding the perfect vehicle for me and he made sure the entire experience was smooth. Car shopping isn't the easiest process, but he took the time to find out what my needs were, my interests and Jake thoroughly made sure I was getting the perfect car for me. What impressed me the most was how much knowledge he has about what he is selling. There is nothing better than a sales guy that KNOWS his product in every aspect. He also took time to make sure my Bluelink was set up and walked me through all of my new car's gadgets. I don't want to work with anyone now when it comes to car shopping. Thank you so much, Jake Peery and Hyundai of Brenham. I will always view ya'll as family. ",5.0

5,"April 25, 2019","We just bought our third Hyundai, and all of them were from the same salesman—Jake, who’s now the sales manager.  He’s trustworthy and extremely knowledgeable about all the models they sell, and he worked hard to give us a great deal and to keep our business.  When it was time to arrange our financing, Zach carefully explained our options and helped us select the best terms possible. We had to drive about an hour to get to this dealership, but the trip was well worth it.",5.0

Hyundai makes incredible cars, God bless!",4.0
11,"November 09, 2017",I went to get my computer reprogrammed and waited two hours for them to tell me that they would not do it because metal from my hub bearings had broken off and went inside my engine. They said that it would be $8000 for a new engine and that I should just buy a new car from them and gave me their card. I have since seen other mechanics who have told me that is not true and actually impossible.,1.2
12,"November 03, 2017","I like my new Hyundai Tucson.  It's a basic model, but has everything I would use.  Road noise is a bit  of an issue; therefore, I suggest adding more sound insulation to upcoming releases.Gas mileage is excellent.  I had to make a special trip to Brenham to discover why I had no rear center lap belt; it was there, but misplaced under the seat, as a result of a seat upgrade.    I paid for my new car with a check, which I wrote out incorrectly.  But Appel staff was patient with me.  I appreciated that.",4.4

22,"July 02, 2017","My experience with Hyundai of Brenham was absolutely amazing. I could not have dreamed of a better sales representative, Jake Peery. He is whom I owe all of this to. I have been searching for my New Hyundai Limited Ultimate Tucson in Dazzling White for a good 6 months. I had been totally let down by several dealerships who have lied and cheated their way through things. My boyfriend found this vehicle one morning, called the dealership and we got Jake on the other end. Jake went as far as sending us pictures of the vehicle to prove that it was on their lot since at that point we were very skeptical of everyone. From that phone call forward, the keys to my car were on his desk and waiting for me until the following Saturday when I could come pick up the vehicle. Jake has been helpful before the purchase, during and after. Not a phone call or text went unanswered. I really appreciate his time, setting the car up for me and his visible loyalty to his customers. Jake was very straight-forward with all costs, features, pros and cons pertaining to the vehicle. There was no haggle or hassle mess which we LOVED! I felt very well informed (even more informed) than any dealership I had been to prior. I cannot believe I even gave any of the ""other guys"" a chance with making this deal with me because my boyfriend and I were blown away by the excellent customer service from Jake.  We were going to make a deal with someone and we are so thankful it was Jake! He knocks every bad statistic about dealers and dealerships. He made buying a car fun, enjoyable and WORTH IT!  We appreciate you Jake and have already told countless friends and family about you and this dealership!  P.S. Cody still wants that F-250. We hope to see you again soon.",5.0
23,"July 01, 2017","I am very happy and I love my SUV!   Jake Peery is an excellent salesman!    Greg Apple is awesome!  True professionals!  This SUV meets my needs and has all of the luxury features I was looking for in a new vehicle.  It is a high quality vehicle.  I had a 2007 Hyundai and I loved it.

I would definitely recommend this dealership if someone is looking for a Hyundai as this is the first Hyundai and I have owned cars from different five different manufacturers so this will be my sixth. The Tucson is nice and has a lot of features to offer with the ultimate package. The panoramic roof is amazing!",5.0
26,"March 14, 2017","We have bought two vehicles at the Brenham Hyundai dealership, and both experiences were great.  They helped us find what we needed, at the price we could afford, and in a timely manner.  Both times an employee went out of their way to help us with financing, and then delivered our new vehicles in pristine conditions.  We are proud Hyundai owners, and will recommend the company highly.",5.0

28,"January 27, 2017","I actually had to enter the showroom to find someone to help me. Once I found someone, he was very nice. The only drawback was the long wait getting everything finalized. I hadn't planned on spending all day at the dealership, but I was there for about 3-4 hours. I had to go find someone to find out what was taking so long. Guessing it was just paperwork. When I arrived at the dealership, I was the only one there. By the time I left, there were other customers, so not sure if they were getting waited on while my paperwork sat for a while. Oh well, all-in-all, it was a pretty good transaction. Just made for a long day!!",4.4

54,"October 28, 2015","I was in the market for a car and had decided that the Hyundai Elantra met my requirements. My stipulations were that the car had to be white and had to have a manual transmission! While other dealers were trying to sell me what they had in stock (with automatic transmissions), Keith Foust and Manager Mike Frees were very willing to get the exact car I was looking for. They got the car and sold it to me at a very good price. I don't live in the local area. Keith offered to deliver the car to me or pick me up to take delivery. Now that is customer service! I am very happy with my new car and with the service provided by Keith Foust, Mike Frees and Hyundai of Brenham! Probably the best car buying experience ever and I highly recommend this dealership!",5.0

58,"April 25, 2014","Me and my daughter went to this dealership in Brenham. It seemed their prices were reasonable but not as good as what I found online at the bigger dealerships. So I left there thinking okay well HUB on 290 would be where we would purchase our Hyundai Elantra. We went there and we excited because we just knew we were getting a good deal. Saving about $3000 compared to the Brenham dealership. Things were good till we got to the finance office and they started adding in more additives. which made up for the $3000 discount I thought I was getting. So I asked more for my trade. All he did was move numbers around. It was ridiculous. Needless to say we drove back to the Brenham dealership and did business and couldn't be happier. It really was quick and easy. They had a great sense of humor and had great hospitality. Really and truly a family like environment. I will continue to buy from them even for my son's first car.
