0,"June 16, 2020","Truck City Ford and especially Michael Forman provided the best I have ever received purchasing a truck. The 7 day returned worked for me. The original truck I purchased just was not a good fit for me so I talked to Michael and he helped me figure out which one was....and then a day later I was driving it. What an experience.
They did what they said they would and had me on the road.

Thanks again Michael",4.8

This man took time to call and check on me and my wife and offered to bring us anything we needed during the China Virus shutdow.What a guy. Thanks Scott you are the Man.,5.0

4,"December 21, 2019","The  ""internet"" price apparently doesn't include the aftermarket junk they have installed a priori.  Approximately 10% additional. In my opinion It's a deceptive practice. I drove to Maxwell Ford and bought the same truck hassle free. They even bested the lowball trade offer from Truck City by over $1000. Last year I bought a truck there and they dealt in good faith. I'll never buy another vehicle there. The smug finance manager made the whole experience stink. I wasted 2 hours driving there.",1.0

6,"July 18, 2019","Having purchased several vehicles over the years, this was as good an experience as I’ve ever had. Really upfront, no b.s., great price. Our salesperson Jeff did a great job working with us to satisfy all our requirements and questions. Everyone we met was very nice. Great inventory choices. Dealership was very neat and clean. Overall a great experience. ",5.0
7,"July 07, 2019","I went to trade in my car and I was concerned about my circumstances, but Monica Z made me feel at ease right away. She’s very courteous, honest, and was able to arrange a deal that works for me with no restrictions. She took into account everything I needed or wanted in a vehicle and made it happen in barely any time at all. I’ve spent so much time before in dealerships trying to get a car and it taking all day. I was happy with the amount of time from arriving and getting my car assessed to me leaving with my new Ford in only a few hours. Talk about fast and efficient! I also learned a lot that I didn’t know before from all the other dealerships I have been to. They even told me things to watch out for in the future when looking for new cars! I will defiantly be back to see Monica when the time comes for another vehicle! Thank you, Monica!",5.0

12,"October 17, 2018",My recent experience buying a new F150 from Truck City Ford was exceptional from first contact through the completion of the sale. A special shout out to Mario Fuentes and Eddie Haddad. Their knowledge and insights provided me with a high degree of confidence that my 5+ star customer experience with Truck City Ford will continue into the future.,5.0
13,"September 05, 2018","I've purchased 49 cars/trucks in the past 30 years.  This was by far the worst experience ever!  A deal was made and then after my 9 hour drive to the dealership, they subtracted $1,500 from my trade value.  Their ""perfect"" 2017 F350 was not so perfect.  Deep scratch in rear seat, running board coming apart, rear sensor missing.  Then, after I bought the vehicle, which I should not have, the GPS and Bluetooth screen cluster failed on my 9 hour drive home.  Dealership in NO way tried to resolve my concerns.  Tires on the truck were smaller than recommend on door jamb and they would not replace either.  Bottom line, we all have a choice where we buy new or used vehicles.  Please save yourself some serious pain and misery and go elsewhere.",1.2
14,"August 30, 2018","My husband and I are very pleased with our purchase and the superb customer service.  Elaine you ROCK!!!  You treated us with respect not just trying to make a sale.  She made sure we were satisfied and very attentive to our needs...with no pressure.  They double our paperwork and two days later found an error in our favor and reach out to us to fix it.  Most dealers would have kept quiet, but their integrity and honesty is above the rest.  Thank you, the Marshalls. ",5.0
15,"August 20, 2018","If you are looking for a vehicle and don't want to deal with pushy tactics or impersonal sales people, then this is the dealership for you! This was by far my best experience at an auto dealership purchasing a vehicle I've had. It was a no pressure experience and everything was made quick and simple. No run around or pressure sales. I worked with Andy in sales and John in finance, both were very helpful in making the buying experience pleasant and informative. Great guys! Even the general manager Scott, introduced himself and thanked me for my business. Whether in person or via the internet, I will be going back there on my next vehicle purchase for sure.

Andy and finance were very helpful in making it a pleasant and informative experience.  I will be going back there on my next truck purchase.  I made a mistake and left some items in my trade-in.

Eddie was awesome, very knowledgeable and took his time explaining all the accessories, etc on our new truck.  Steve was most helpful and helping us get the best deal possible on our trade in and making the deal work.  Was also awesome in helping  us finalize our paperwork.

21,"July 15, 2018","I have only had my truck a couple of days so far and it is exactly what I was looking for.  I had purchased 2 years ago from another dealer which left a VERY bad taste in my mouth but Mike made me comfortable,  The only problem is I didn`t ""kick the tires"".  I had to buy new tires the next day.  YES, I will definitely refer the Buda crew!  Thanks Mike and Chris.",4.0
22,"June 07, 2018","I was looking for a truck for my husband. I have always dreaded buying a vehicle. This time I decided to have online quotes emailed to me, communicating by email and phone. Truck City Ford contacted me immediately and answered my many, many questions. Joseph (Joe) Bishaw was so patient with my concerns. It was such a pleasure dealing with someone that treated me with respect and honesty. He quoted an excellent price, located the truck I wanted and had it sent to their dealership. We picked it up the next day. My husband loves his new truck. Thank you Joe and Truck City Ford. You are the best.",5.0
23,"May 31, 2018",Kim was extremely helpful and there was no pressure. He worked with us in getting the best vehicle for our needs and at a very good price.,5.0
24,"May 23, 2018","Jennifer Odom took over from Zach Hale to get me into the vehicle I needed and wanted.  Trust was established, and that's a big deal.  All of the folks in new and used sales were supportive.  While it takes a while to get through the standard processing for sale and loan, I was not just left to drift off in my waiting room chair.  I felt transported back in time to the small town dealership that would encourage high school kids to come in and look at new cars coming in and talk to you about what you were doing in the scout troop, where you were going for college or, most importantly, who was going to ride in one of the dealer's convertibles in the homecoming parade.  I felt like a connection was being made, a relationship was being built, not just a sale being racked up.
Something I hope to be a part of sustaining now.  I have never been a Ford buyer in the past, but Leif Johnson's excellent reputation in this community was well-served by what I experienced.
Thanks again

25,"May 17, 2018","I just want to say that buying a vehicle from a dealership has been one of my worst nightmares. I hate pressure sales, and I can't stand being hovered over like buzzards on carrion. So, I was not feeling good when I came into Truck City Ford, but I would soon find myself feeling quite well about the place in no time. The salesperson Ellaine was wonderful. She was not pushy, and was very respectable. She answered all my questions, and the whole process in purchasing the car was by far the fastest deal I have ever had, and what was even better was the fact that they knew that I was wanting to deal with my bank, but found me something that was a far better deal. So I can say without a doubt that I will be shopping here again in the future. Thank You Ellaine! Your AWESOME! ",5.0
26,"May 09, 2018","I have purchased over 6-7 Vehicles from this dealership over the last 15 years. From that first day I walked in the showroom I was treated with respect and honesty. You only have 2 things in life that make a real difference, one is your word, the other is your integrity. Wesley my salesman and his support staff at the dealership in Austin and Buda demonstrated this each and every time. I will also say the support from Ford Motor Company providing top quality product only adds to the benefit!!    ",5.0
27,"May 07, 2018","My experience buying a new Transit was excellent. The worked with me all the way, and were very honest and open about exactly what was going on. Andy McCreadie and John Jones, along with Cody and Eddie Haddad, were easy to deal with and thorough.",5.0
28,"April 10, 2018","Was a very easy experience.  Found a car that I wanted to look at which was at their north Austin lot.  The brought it to Buda on spec. as I was not committed to do anything but look.
The car was what I could work with and the price was well within the fair market value (true car value) as an excellent deal.
 Bought the car. Elaine was very helpful and a good person to work with.",4.8
29,"April 07, 2018","I recently purchased a 2018 F 150 from Truck City.  Eddie Haddad is a great salesman.  He was very informative, able to answer all my questions, and presented different options that might interest me.  He provided the lowest price up front, no back and forth games, and no pressure.  After my purchase he took the time to walk me through all the vehicle's features and made sure I was completely satisfied before driving off.  I recommend Truck city and especially recommend Eddie, be sure to ask for him if you are looking for a new vehicle!",5.0
30,"April 02, 2018","Eddie Hadad went out of his way to make sure we were happy. Very prompt, honest and informative. I never felt like I was being pressured. Got a fair price on my trade in.  Good price on the new vehicle.  ",5.0
31,"March 28, 2018","I originally pulled into Truck City Ford just to convince myself that the other truck I was planning on buying from another manufacturer was the right one for me.  Eddie and Zack met me on the lot and began answering my questions around the Raptor they had and before I knew it I was test driving it and falling in love.  The price difference between the two trucks wasn't small, but both Eddie and Zack had so much knowledge on the differences and were so easy to work with, I drove off that evening in a new truck.

The crew at Truck City are all geared toward making customers feel welcome and important that you'll not have a minute of buyers remorse!",4.8
32,"March 18, 2018","I went to Ford Truck City for a weekly driver and hauling truck [read I wanted both eco and hauling capacity] - I was uncertain if the F-250 was right since no estimated MPG could be found/communicated. I was contacted about 3 times before the new 2018 F-150's came in and was told, with the upgraded towing capacity, this eco-boost F-150 might be what I was looking for. - Good job Jeff.",5.0

36,"February 05, 2018","Brandon Cronk and the team at Truck City made buying a gently used SUV straight forward and extremely comfortable. Their honest approach to selling made me feel at ease and they were never pushy to make the sale. They are confident in their products and did not waste my time, and yet were very patient with my concerns and answered all of my questions. Brandon stayed late to allow me and my husband to take a second test drive and the finance team worked into the following day to get us the best finance rate! We will definitely use them again and recommend them to everyone.",5.0
37,"February 05, 2018","Best buying experience every time.  Eddie Haddad not only listens but he does what you need to have done so that the process is fast, done behind the scenes and you can not only get what you need but at a great price, good terms and quickly.",5.0
38,"February 02, 2018","Worked Jennifer Odom for little under a week before making a final purchase. Not only was the process of buying made easy and worry free. They got me exactly what I wanted at the price I wanted. Jennifer was an outstanding individual that made my wife and I not only feel safe in the purchase of our new truck but made us feel like her own personal family. She had a real down to earth attitude, listens to her clients and really puts her self out there to get them exactly what they want. I could not be happier with my purchase and time spent with the dealership. Congratulations Truck City Ford, exceptional service and employees! ",4.0

43,"January 16, 2018","This is the second time I've looked for a super duty and ended up at Truck City.  Prices in and around Austin are higher than elsewhere and the other dealers were asking way too much for new or used. When I did find a 2016 SD at another dealer it was leaking oil.  In the past I've had to chase dealers for slipping in 'extras' or wander around looking for my truck and keys while the salesman held them hostage so it's nice to be able to go in and have a simple,  above board conversation.  Highly recommend stopping by if you're in the market for a fair deal. ",5.0

46,"January 01, 2018",I was nervous walking into a dealership being a first time buyer. I wanted to get a used truck but was unsure of what I really wanted. There are so many options and I have never owned a truck before. The selection huge and I needed help with all the options available. Mike and Sean really helped me narrow down my options and helped me pick something that would be the best fit for me. A month later and I couldn't be happier with my truck and with my overall experience. Both Mile and Sean were very super helpful on not only finding the vehicle but clearly helping me through the process of buying a vehicle. I would recommend them to all of my family and friends. Thank you Sean and Mike! I love my 4X4 Nissan Frontier!,5.0

50,"December 15, 2017","I was in search of a newer vehicle for a good while. I drive a lot for my job so it was about time to upgrade. Dennis Ortiz was very helpful with my future buy. He was very accommodating and went out his way to make sure my car buying experience went smoothly. He kept in constant communication over the months that I was shopping around, he was more concerned with me getting a better deal instead of just trying to make the sale. When I went down to the dealership we took the car for a spin, he was a very down to earth salesman. He didn’t approach you as salesman, but rather someone that is just wanting the best for you and overall great guy.

62,"September 24, 2017","To Whom It May Concern;
 
I never write comments - -  good or bad - - on social media or for business websites.
However, after such a positive truck-buying experience at Truck City Ford, I am making an exception. 
 
First, a few comments about our Sales Counselor, Jennifer Odom.
Jennifer is a top-tier professional in her field. She clearly has achieved in-depth knowledge of her products; took the time to listen and learn what was important to us as potential customers for a new vehicle; and most important, she clearly cares enough about her job, her employer and her customers to give her very best effort.
 
About Truck City.
We bought a truck there three years ago. It was a good experience.
Our needs in a truck changed, so we went back there last week to purchase another truck.
 
We are happy with our purchase and the deal. And we are also very pleased that we were able to close the sale without having the “Sales Manager” come into the cubicle to assure us he was our new very best friend (but was really there to close the deal). :-)
 
Mike

65,"August 23, 2017","Eddie Haddad at Truck City Ford was awesome. He found the truck I wanted and texted pics of it to me to ensure that is was what I wanted. He had it cleaned and gassed up by the time I got to the dealership.  It was the easiest and most expedient experience I have ever had at a dealership.  I would highly recommend Truck City Ford and Eddie Haddad. He did everything he could to make the process go smoothly and quickly. The quickness was expecially  important to me since I was replacing a vehicle that was totaled in an accident. I needed to get a new vehicle quickly. Everything was done over the phone and by email. When I got to the dealership all I had to do was sign the paperwork. Thank you Eddie and Truck City.

This was the first time I didn't feel any pressure.  I never felt like I was being sold something I didn't want.  Eddie showed me the perfect truck.  It was big enough to pull an RV, had enough room to fit all my sons and grandsons for a hunting trip and didn't have all the extras I didn't need.  It has some really great features.

She went the extra mile and then some to make certain I was comfortable with the vast array of features my new vehicle had to offer prior to my leaving the dealership. She was most generous with her time. It is refreshing to see a Sales Consultant that is truly committed to the customer, customer service and more importantly, service after the sale!

74,"June 29, 2017","First off, I am completing this review as a newly/satisfied customer of Leif Johnson's Truck City Ford. The standards and practices of doing business far EXCEEDED my expectations. You will be impressed with their selection and upkeep of vehicles within their inventory. The 2016 F-150 I purchased fit my exact criteria so it was worth a 8-9 hour drive from El Paso. The PRICE was indeed right too! After all, this is what gets you to a dealership and entices you. Ask for Sales Rep Brandon Cronk who will be completely honest from the get go and will work with you all that he can. Again, the prices you see online or in person are GREAT so the hassle of haggling isn't really necessary. I got what I wanted and drove 8 hours for and began the process that Finance Manager Steve Clark handled. A mishap occurred at my bank during pre-approval and Steve jumped into action and got me financed out of town with FORD within minutes!  Again, no added, hidden fees once you reach that process either! (Be advised, get the warranties offered for a vehicle) Thank you Truck City Ford for helping me get exactly what I wanted!! I will recommend you all to even the locals back home!",5.0

79,"May 25, 2017","Our son totaled his truck on Easter morning when a group of deer caused him to veer off the road, run up an embankment, slam into a tree, and flip several times.  He adored his truck.  We spent weeks scouring the country for the perfect replacement truck, and finally found it with Truck City Ford. We live in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, so we were not sure how a long-distance purchase would work.  Dennis Ortiz was the sales rep we dealt with most of the time.  He was responsive to both emails and text messages, but slow to respond with the actual documents needed to process the sale.  After 3 days of trying to get the required documentation that our credit union needed for the loan, I sent one final text and was told by Mr. Ortiz that ""I was not the only customer he had to deal with.""  Wow.  We just about walked away from the deal.  However, we were finally placed with Jarad Darby, and he was fantastic!  He took over the complicated process of a long-distance sale, and things finally clicked along quickly and smoothly.  Our son flew into Austin from Birmingham, and Jarad made sure someone was there waiting to pick him up from the airport.  Jarad quickly got our son set up in his new truck, and within two hours, he was headed east back to Alabama with his new truck.  Jarad Darby was wonderful to work with, efficient, and willingly worked through some touch logistics to help our son secure his new dream truck!  Thank you Mr. Darby!!",4.0

After riding in their 2010 F-150 off and on over the years, I decided I wanted one to replace my SUV. Turns out, my parents are former customers of Eddie, going way back (2 or 3 purchases over the years). So, we made it a family tradition to go in together. Within a few days, we both found what we wanted, with Eddie helping us narrow down a right fit with an agreeable price. They went with a great red 2017 Ford Explorer, and I went with the 2017 XLT F150. We both are happy with our choices and how quickly Eddie and his team moved to get us into our new cars.

100,"November 04, 2016","     My 90 year old brother in law and I loved the old 2002 Ford 150 Truck with more than 100,000 miles on it(OUT OF WARRANTY); but had to acknowledge that - when it needed repairs - that the ""repair cost prices were not fixed///out of warranty"" and cut DEEPLY into Johnny's retirement ""fixed income."" In fact we knew that - if he had to just get the roof window fixed - (it was not broken but I had recently had an incident with my own FORD roof window---OUT OF WARRANTY---where I was told at another Ford Dealership in New Braunfels that it would cost $1,800 to fix it!)---I imagined that such a minor repair to the old 2002 Ford 150 Truck MIGHT cost more than Johnny could get on a trade-in value. 
    We began timidly looking at new Trucks; encouraged by good news from Johnny's doctor that his health is very good. (Old Czech family genes are not OUT OF WARRANTY YET.) Eddie Haddad at Truck City is a professional who quickly cut through to the ""deal."" We told him what we wanted (to be able to fit a payment for a New Truck and insurance into Johnny's fixed monthly income) - in order to have a SAFE NEW TRUCK and limit the amount of REPAIRS OUT-OF- POCKET for Johnny who had a limited reserve (savings) for a ""rainy day""---that hopefully may NEVER COME in his future!
    Eddie, Scott and EO worked with us diligently. Johnny is a retired Marine and the trio gave Johnny as many REBATES as they could! (I was so happy about this and Johnny IS SO PROUD!) Also, the Leif Johnson Ford Truck City sold us a 125,000 Mile Vehicle Service Contract (good anywhere in US and Canada) which is transferable if Johnny decides to sell the Truck! In addition, Eddie, Scott and EO sold us a 100,000 mile Maintenance Plan which pays for oil, filter changes, all those necessary expenses --- until 10/24/2024!
      On the day that Eddie and Scott explained ALL to us, I - not a trusting soul - just thought there was some ""gimmick""---I know they were disappointed that I wanted time to check the Warranties out BEFORE WE BOUGHT THE NEW TRUCK.  They gave me WARRANTY copies and released Johnny and me to compare with - for example - the Dodge Dealership and a Truck we had tested there. As a result, Johnny and I returned confidently to Leif Johnson Ford Truck City within about a week and bought the 2016 Ford 150. We are very pleased with our purchase!
     I recommend this Dealership to EVERYONE but especially women like me who like to be treated professionally and fairly and old Marines who need to update their TRUCKS to be SAFE on the Texas Hwys). Eddie, Scott and EO are GOOD LISTENERS, and seemed to have our best interests in mind. Sincerely, Debbie G. Asbury",5.0

134,"March 06, 2016","On Wednesday, after days of researching online, I called Truck City to see if a salesperson could get a couple vehicles from other lots down to their location to compare to one on their lot. I was pretty sure what I wanted but we didn't want to drive all the way across Austin several times to be sure. When the operator asked ""new or used"" I explained that I was looking at used but that I was also curious about the new Escapes due to the promotional pricing available. 

I spoke with John Lesly who told me he'd arrange for vehicles to be there and to meet with me on Thursday at 10am. He sent a follow up email to that effect and that, if for any reason he wouldn't be there, Brian Geary would be available to help me.

We arrived at 10 on Thursday and the office staff were confused about what I was talking about because it was John AND Brian's days off. We were handed off to another sales person (Eddie Haddad) who walked with us to check to see if our requested vehicles were there but couldn't find them and said he would get the one we most wanted brought down. At this point, Eddie introduced us to Maria Garcia who would ""be helping out.""

THREE HOURS LATER our vehicle was on property and we were able to test drive, Eddie was there at the beginning of our test drive and during the following 4.5 hours, we never saw him again. Things were totally dead out in the used sales building. One poor sales guy was practically spinning in his chair he was so bored. Someone really should have connected us with him. Maria kept running back and forth between new and used to check on us as we waited. She even washed our car herself because it hadn't already been done in all the time we waited. While we were waiting, there was a car out front exhibiting the impressive speaker power and blaring music loud enough to be loud in the building and the television was on the same show channel turned up loud enough to be heard over the car outside. The waiting room itself was like some kind of over-stimulation experiment with all the noise and the lack of communication during all that down time was excruciating.  

Maria was empathetic and helpful and genuinely caught in the middle of an awkward situation. Yoany was wonderful while we were signing the last of our paperwork.

Then I received an automated email from John Lesly.... ""It was a pleasure to meet you and help you get into your new vehicle"" WE NEVER MET, John - You left us hanging and completely wrecked our day and made the day much more stressful than it should have been.  I suspect that John is the one that earned our commission and this SHOULD NOT be the case.  Maria Garcia is the one that should get paid, she did all the sales person work.

Maria, again, we are truly grateful for your help!",2.5

I then visited a few other dealerships that included the main Leif Johnson location and all the reps I worked with didn't have the breath and width of knowledge of the Platinum model and I even had to show the reps some of the features I learned from Brian Geary at Truck City. I knew immediately after those experiences that I was going to purchase from Brian Geary. If you want a truck and want to learn as much about a vehicle, go see Brian!!

151,"October 23, 2015","We purchased a used truck, paid cash and did all paperwork, etc and never received the plates.  We called the salesman and were told he was just about to call us, because he didn't get the truck inspected before we left the dealership - which is against the law!  Since we live out of town, we had to take the truck to get the inspection and while on the phone with the salesman, fax proof of inspection to the salesman and he confirmed he received it.  Two weeks later, still no plates.  When we call salesman back, says he never received the proof of inspection, so we send it again.  Wait a week, still no plates.  Call salesman back and there is another paper we need to fill out for the title, but they would e-mail us with the link and we needed to go online to finish the registration process and then they can get us the plates in a few days.  So, go online and fill in all info and it says it was sent to dealership.  I then get a manager on the phone and let him know how unhappy I am about this and his salesman giving us the run around every time we call and that our paper plate is now expired by 8 days.  He apologized and said that the state of Texas changed  how titles were processed 2 weeks ago and they are having to go back and get customers to go online to finish their registrations - it's been 8 weeks since we bought the truck and the state didn't even have that process in place at that time, so someone messed up.  He agreed and said he needs to train his salesman better because this shouldn't have happened, the salesmen do not understand, but he would expedite getting us the plates.  I don't think I will hold my breath waiting for them to arrive.  This dealership and lost my business forever and I would never recommend them to anyone.",1.4

156,"September 09, 2015","The best part of the experience was interacting with the salesman John Lesly and the receptionist. They were pleasant and that was a nice change from my previous experiences from around the Austin metro-area as a female buyer.
Besides that, it went downhill pretty quick. The thing that bothers me most is that it is mandatory that all vehicles purchased from Truck City Ford have Lo-Jack installed on them (or at least this is what I was told). 
When was I told this?
I was signing the purchase paperwork when I FIRST heard of this. I had to ask, what was this additional charge on the paperwork. In all honesty, I probably would have purchased from a closer dealership if this was known to me ahead of time (because the prices were pretty similar within a 30 miles radius of my home).
I really won't go into the other problems due to finance not correctly processing my paperwork, but 2 weeks later, things are finally getting sorted out. I brought pre-approval financing, and that must be an alien experience for the dealership.
The experience was only better than average, and that was mostly due to having a decent salesperson who didn't patronize me. ",3.2

163,"July 15, 2015","I truly believe that Eddie Haddad at Truck City is a magician in the car sales industry.  Eddie was the salesperson up for a client when I walked in.  He took the time to give me a number on my trade and then sit and just talk finance with me without ever bringing up a new vehicle.  Our first conversation was strictly discovering if it made sense to trade or keep what I had.  After about 20 minutes of talking finance, we exchanged business cards and agreed to reconnect the following week.

In the mean time I did shop two other Ford dealers and was greeted with the typical sales pitch, including one dealer telling me that they would not give me a number on my trade unless I paid them a appraisal fee! 

The following week I reached out to Eddie, as we agreed, and began work in earnest on finding me the exact truck I was after. After searching high and low across Central Texas we found the perfect vehicle sitting right in front of us.  After a test drive and a quick credit app, I left the dealership with the promise that they would call me to firm up the details.  Two hours later I get a call from Eddie with the first offer.  It was too high so back to the drawing board we went. Thirty minutes later came the second offer. Still too high. An hour later the third offer was put before we which hit every number I needed. Deal was done and we agreed to meet the following afternoon to finalize paperwork.

Oh, I forgot to mention, Eddie did all of this ON HIS DAY OFF!!  Talk about committed to customer service!!

Fast forward to the next afternoon. Eddie stayed late to go over the bells and whistles of the new truck. Paperwork was completed in about an hour.  It would have been less expect for a misspelling of my name.

I'm 54 years old and for the first time in my life I didn't have to settle for second, third or fourth best in a vehicle. I have been looking on the internet for an Explorer at different dealership for weeks. They all looked nice. Told other Ford competitors I would be in Saturday to look at what they had. My wife had given me some names of other dealerships so, I looked them up. One of them was Truck City Ford. I searched their web site and lord and behold there it was, an XLT with a Sport model package! I said to myself that's the one ! So, even though I was scheduled to go to San Antonio and look, something told me to go to Truck City. When my wife and I got there they already had that Explorer parked out at front-nice! Everyone at Ford City was nice and polite. They asked us if we wanted anything while we waited for Frank who was with another customer, you know coke or water the usual. Frank introduced me to and I'm terrible with names and he had a low voice but it was either Ken or Ben, I'm sorry for not remembering but, he was so polite and was very attentive to our feelings, never making us feel we are bothering him or we weren't worthy of buying a vehicle. Anytime my wife or I started to speak he stop talking and listened to our needs. He never pushed anything on us, which I liked. We told them we could only afford a payment of $470.00 a month and they got it to $474.00 with a 4 year 100,000 mile warranty. Loan rate started at 7% and they dropped it to 5.49%. And my credit wasn't great-I was so amazed! Before this all happened I'd told them what do you have that's less expensive that I could settle for? They knew I wanted that truck and that's what they worked on getting me. They actually wanted me to be happy, again-wow! After all paper work was signed, they didn't let me leave until I felt comfortable driving it away. You see, this truck is loaded with features, I mean air-conditioning vents in the ceiling, come on, this is not a house? So way cool as the younger generation would say. It has a  glass cockpit like an aircraft-cool beans! 7 seats, and the 2nd and 3rd row fold down so easy, a little old lady can do it her self. I could go on and on. Friends that have seen it were really impressed and I told them before you buy anywhere stop by Ford Truck City in Buda TX.

173,"April 08, 2015","Called about service, spoke to Brandon and was told that he couldn't see if my truck had a ""full synthetic"" service plan with only the VIN even though I had bought the plan from truck city and needed to take it in to find out for sure. Took my truck in for a 60k service and spoke to Keith. Low and behold, the info was right on the screen with the VIN alone. I have learned to read my paperwork before I leave this place cause I have not received the full synthetic in other periodic service. I paid alot of money for this service plan and hate getting ripped off by truck city. The first three services were done with ""synthetic blend"" not ""full synthetic"" and I only received a half xxx difference of their cost for the oil but not the full cost of my service. What a scam. My trust in this dealership for buying or servicing vehicles has gone down the drain. Lesson learned the costly way.

Update; about a week after my initial service visit, the service manager was able to assist with all my service concerns.

If you are looking for a Ford (and you should be) in the Austin or surrounding areas stop by and check this place out. They only sell trucks and SUV's so the staff is extremely knowledgeable on their product. Much more so than a full lineup where the staff need a broad knowledge of all products including cars and such.   My salesman (Adam Perry) was the easiest car salesman I have ever worked with. He listened to my wants and needs and found a vehicle from another lot that was perfect. And, he had it delivered overnight so it would be there first thing in the morning when I got there. He was very honest through the entire process. Everybody has had experiences with ""that"" sales guy who fudges the facts and highlights the good while conveniently omitting the bad stuff.

192,"November 15, 2014","I hate buying a new car or truck, so this go round, I shopped on the internet. I found the very best price on a 2014 F150 XLT at Truck City Ford. Someone promptly texted me about the truck, checked that it was available on the lot and set up an evening time to for me to test drive. I worked with Adam, who is the internet sales manager. He was extremely courteous, patient, and low key. No hard sell here. He explained that the beauty of internet sales is that the very best possible deal is posted. All I had to do was test drive and decide if I wanted the truck.

This 2014 model was miles advanced from my 2005 F150, but I paid the same price! That's a great deal. In fact, the deal was so good, that I was able to upgrade to leather seats and get my bedliner blown in, too. Edmund's reviewed this year model and said the dashboard electronics were confusing. I thought they were pretty easy to figure out. The seats seem a little thinner than my '05, but I can't say they are less comfortable. Overall, the interior upgrades are very satisfactory. I also downgraded to a V6. I'm pleased with it's torque. It feels as punchy as my old V8, so I think it will do just fine for my needs.  It's a nice ride!  

I'm still waiting to schedule my seat upgrade and bedliner, but so far the service has been very good. Adam even met me at my office to show me leather samples.  The only flaw in  my experience was a scratch on the front bumper of the truck. It looks like a worker didn't report his little accident when moving the truck. Adam responded immediately, and gave me no hassle about getting that touched up. 

Overall, I would recommend Truck City's internet sales department. It's a fast, no hassle way to get the truck you want, and the price was fantastic.

I'll deduct a star because the truck was not detailed when I arrived to test drive it. I understand they don't want to put that work into a vehicle that might not get sold. However, had that been done, they would have caught the scratch on the front bumper before I bought it. (It was dark when I test drove and bought the truck, so I didn't see the damage until the next day.)  If the service goes as well as the sale, then this is a good dealership that's worth the drive to Buda.",4.6

203,"July 05, 2014","I live about 50 miles from dealership, so our relationship started over the internet and phone. I was interested in a truck. When the sales rep contacted me about the truck he was honest and told me that it was hard to see in the pictures, but there was a decent size dent in the drivers side. I told him I was still interested as long as he could send me some better up close pictures of the damage. He said he would be sending them the next day. Next day came and I called about the pictures and they said they would get them to me and I never did. I finally got a call the next day asking if I was still interested in the truck. I replied that I was still waiting on ""the pictures"" they were supposed to send. I finally got a couple of pictures, but they were horrible quality, so I just decided to drive up and check out the truck. Before I came I asked if the dent was the only bad cosmetic problem. They replied yes, that the truck was clean in and out and ran strong. When I arrived the truck was in horrible shape. The exterior, besides the dent, was thrashed and should have been buffed and waxed by a professional. The interior had dog hair throughout the cab and smelt of dog as well. Very dirty interior, but with a couple of hours of elbow grease and some commercial cleaning equipment and chemicals the truck could really shine up nicely. I took their word as they explained they had just gotten the truck. Which was a little true, but I was still disappointed. They knew I was a serious buyer and should not had let me drive all that way until they had deeply detailed the truck. The other big thing was they said they had driven the truck down from their other location. No worries about that except when I popped the hood there was no air intake. The shroud was mounted, but there was no ducting or filter. They did immediately write a ticket and had an intake installed the next day. We ended up meeting in the middle on a price and both me and the sales rep seemed to be happy. The deal was we would get the paperwork started and I would be back the next day to finish and odd end paperwork and they would have the entire day to detail the inside and outside of the truck. Even though the cosmetics are not the major reasons for buying the truck it was so dirty that it absolutely needed an experienced commercial cleaner to handle the inside and outside. The next day I drove another 50 miles to the dealer to get the truck. The anticipation was exciting as I knew the truck had a lot of potential to look like a completely different truck with the proper cleaning. I was also assured the truck would look spectacular. Brodie, the sales rep, explained the day before that they had a crew of cleaners that were amazing and could get the truck looking tip top. When I got there I was greatly disappointed. The smell of dog was still there. The dog hair was still there. The interior looked like someone may have sprayed down and wiped the dashboard, but that would be saying a lot. The exterior looked like they wasted a bottle of tire cleaner on the walls of the tires to make the truck exterior look good. No polishing had been done, no waxing had been done. No effort was made as promised. I was very angry. Being in the military I have a great deal of patience and did not over react. I was so upset I just wanted to get off the dealership property before I caused a scene. Even the sales rep Brodie was embarrassed. He pulled out some of his own interior cleaner and started to wipe down the interior. I asked him to stop because it needed to be scrubbed by a commercial cleaner not a simple spray and wipe. His efforts were noticed, but not needed. He even game me a couple bottles of the cleaner to take with me. Which was a nice thing to do, but no consolation to the horrible effort on the dealerships part. I have had a couple quotes done to get the interior and exterior cleaned and polished. It is going to cost me around $450 out of my pocket to get done what the dealer promised would be done and did not do. Overall, I am very disappointed in the dealership. Happy with the efforts made by Brodie. I would have thought about doing more business with them had they offered to let me leave with the truck and they would reimburse me for paying a commercial cleaner to do the work that they should have done. That is the only thing that could have made it right. Until then I would definitely not do business with them again. It is not the way you are supposed to do business with your customers, especially when they are the ones making a bigger effort to do business with you then you are with them.",2.4

I negotiated a good price with a 2 year warranty included. By the end of it, I walked out with a decent deal and a better car than I had before. Then a couple weeks later I get an email from the finance manager asking for proof that my car was totaled. I was confused and asked what he was talking about. He said they put in the finance application with the note that my current car had a lien but was totaled. My only guess is that these cheats put that in there to make sure my loan application would go through. By the end of it, my loan amount was actually lowered because the bank would not allow for a higher amount. That meant my 2 year extended warranty was taken off. This was AFTER i already signed the contract. I would have fought them on this, because it was their mistake and I had already signed the contract, but I was so angry having had to come up their now 3 times to resolve this matter.

We told him what I was looking for and the price range and he showed us a good selection of vehicles to choose from. I ended up test driving a Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo and the Ford F150 SuperCrew that I had seen online. He asked me what my needs were for the vehicle and told me the advantages and disadvantages of each. I ended up with the Ford F150 SuperCrew and they honored the Internet price of the vehicle. Their prices are by far the lowest in the area and the most bang for your buck. All the vehicles I looked at were extremely clean and look and feel brand new, even thought they are used. The only negative thing would be that they didn't knock off any money for the small dent in the front bumper since the internet price was the lowest they could go. Since there was only one key available for the vehicle, we had to pay for the price of the key and they paid for it to be programmed, which would have cost me over $100.

227,"July 18, 2013",I found Tommy Roth knowledgeable on both the truck I was looking for and the finance/ESP end of the deal.  I would reccomend him as a salesman to everyone.,5.0
228,"July 06, 2013","We were first drawn to this dealership because the advertised lowest internet prices were lower than any prices quoted by any other dealership. Upon arrival at the showroom we found that the advertised prices were honored and there was no ""switch and bait"".
Truck advertised was in stock at the price advertized and that is the price we were able to purchase it for.
Tommy Roth was our salesperson and he worked very hard to expedite the servicing and installation of our new truck with the extra options we requested. I was about to depart for an overseas work assignment and he was able to get the truck ready for delivery and into our hands for me to drive within 3 working days, so that I was able to receive and drive my new truck prior to my temporary job departure. I only rated the quality of workmanship as good, as the truck exterior was accidentally sprayed with either the undercoating or bedliner spray and will need to be cleaned/buffed/waxed to remove the spray particles from the paint job. Perhaps this was due to the very rush nature in my asking for speedy delivery of the truck. I have been assured that upon my return from overseas that the Buda dealership will clean and detail the exterior of my truck without charge (free) to remove the sprayed materials from the paint job.
I am very pleased with the truck and the service, especially being aware that the rush was to accomodate my timeline which Tommy and the dealership worked very hard to do. Yes, I do 'recommend this dealership to anyone considering purchasing a new Ford Truck.  ",4.8

Lou told me this truck was in great shape except for a missing piece of trim on the tailgate, minor paint scratches, and it wouldn't come out of 4x4 but that was going to be fixed before i got there. Lou told me the truck was checked out by there mechanics and needed nothing but a new owner, he also told me he personally drove it and checked everything. So i drive 3 hours there. When i got there the truck was waiting up front before i ever put the key in the ignition i found the tilt steering broken, the steering wheel wouldn't come down and steering column was very loose. On the test drive before i got out of the parking lot i found with Lou sitting beside me the passenger power mirror didn't work, the heater didn't work, the front end had very loud popping in it without hitting any bumps, The compass and fuel mileage indicator didn't work. When i asked him about these things he would not respond. I asked him why he didn't find these things wrong with the truck since he drove it  and assured me nothing was wrong with it. They where not willing to take care of any of these problems or work with me on the price of the truck. Since he lied to me about the condition of the truck I was very upset and walked out then realized that i had his keys and he had mine. He had to get my keys from his sales manager, the sales manager asked what the problem was. Lou told him that I didn't want the truck because of all the problems they didn't tell me about. I told them the only way i would do the deal was if they came down on the price or fixed the problems with the truck, they said no so i walked out, while i was walking out Lou told me he had been doing this for a long time I told him obviously not long enough because he doesn't know how to treat customers.

246,"December 11, 2012","I purchased a pre-owned Ford Expedition from Lou Dieter on 12/1 over at Truck City Ford and could not be happier with the experience. I called ahead because it was a bit of a drive, and when I arrived, Lou was standing there with the truck ready to go. He was great with my kids, and even held my 7 month old daughter while I looked the vehicle over with my wife, and still managed to demonstrate the different features.

When I took it for a test drive, he didn't try to direct me where to go. This is important because you need to test a vehicle out bot on and off the highway, perform hard breaking as well as lead footed acceleration. Many salesmen try to get away with a quick trip around the block. 

Now because this was relatively new for a pre-owned vehicle and the miles were low, I was pretty sure I would purchase, so long as the price was right and I got a good deal on my trade. Before taking it for their ""appraisal"" I explained a couple of things that might be of interest and about 10 minutes later we were sitting at his desk talking numbers.  Since didn't require their financing I mercifully didn't have to deal with a finance manager, but of course, whenever negotiations begin, the salesman has to go talk to him. I overheard some of their conversation, and Lou really went to bat for me. He wanted to get the deal done without a ton of BS, and without treating me like I would never get a better price on a vehicle as long as I lived. Many dealers train their sales reps to try and take control of the conversation, talk abut payments instead of price, and generally try to make you feel like they are doing YOU the favor as they cry poverty and talk about how they are losing money on the deal (Never happens by the way). I didn't have to deal with any of that nonsense, and for me, that is worth the price of admission. We came to our price in less than 10 minutes and both sides were satisfied. This is the number one reason for my positive rating. I was treated with genuine respect. 

Aside from Lou, I did have a quick handshake with the finance manager, and about 5 minutes with the paperwork guy, which is how I like it. Once I agreed to purchase, they wrapped up the detailing and I was on my way. I highly recommend Truck City Ford to anyone in the market for a new or used vehicle, and definitely ask for Lou. ",4.8

249,"November 01, 2012","I will never use their service dept again.  I don't care if I have to drive 100 miles.  Started off very wrong from the get go.  When I walked in that morning, I was left standing there for over 5 minutes with noone acknowledging my existence and I was the only person in there besides the employees.  When I finally said something, the rude gentlemen with the glasses facing the front door said ""Well, most people come in this door""  Really!!!  It matters which door I come in as to if I'm going to be waited on or not.  My vehicle stayed there almost two weeks with minor issues.  One of the issues was never fixed and is actually worse now.  Gray (my contact there) was nice enough but needs better follow up and communication.  He told me my vehicle would be ready at a certain time that I wouldn't need to call before I came.  Well, I go and my vehicle wasn't ready.  Had to leave and come back the next day.  They gave me a rental truck while they were supposedly fixing my car.  I had it filled up on the day I was to pick up mine.  If you recall I had to come back the next day because my car wasn't ready.  I told Gray then I wasn't putting anymore gas in it as it was there mistake.  Well, that was around August 3.  I get my credit card statement in October and they charged me $5.99 for a gallon of gas.  That was the last straw which led to this review.  I called Gray three days ago to find out why I was charged.  He still hasn't called me back, I had to call the AJ Rent Car to find out myself.  They have some kind of award for best service center on their wall-something to that effect.  What a joke that is!  Kim Finney ",1.0

He didn't have exactly what we thought we wanted, so he took us in his office and we looked at the inventory at all the locations and he was very willing to have a vehicle brought to the Buda location for us to see. As it was a rainy day, I really didn't want to spend the afternoon going from one car lot to the other, so being able to see ""true"" inventory online was a huge time saver and relief!  We decided on the truck and the paperwork process was a cinch! Ross had the truck detailed one last time for us, although it was super clean when we test drove it.

During our phone conversation he seemed genuinely interested in our needs and when we arrived at the dealership, we had his full attention from the minute we walked in the door. When we arrived, the truck we had come to look at was in front of the show room and was ready for a test drive. Although we thought we knew what we wanted, we drove three different trucks at his request. Ultimately, we drove away in a new F-250 that was a better fit for our towing needs.  My husband and I are very happy with our choice and thankful that Eddie had the foresight to suggest we look at all the options. We were able to spend time going over all the technology and features of the truck, as well as financing options which resulted in having a good comfort level leaving with our new purchase, and a great financing rate and extended warranty. We were at the dealership from 11am to 6pm, which may seem like a long time to some people,but we were pleased that no one was rushing the process and that the staff was there to assist us the entire time.

I had high expectations as I've bought a truck from them before back in 2010. The only drawback I would offer up is that after arriving back from my bank ready to sign and leave with my truck, I waited almost an hour (about 50 minutes) to sign my contract. They were doing a last minute wash and detail and final mechanic check, and then another salesperson had their customer walk in to the finance manager's office before they could pull around with my truck.

He never pressured me or try to sway me to a particular truck. I chose 2 and wanted my husband to make the final decision, so we drove both trucks to my house my husband test drove both. We made our choice, went back to the dealership did the paperwork and I drove my truck home. West & Scotty both were very pleasant to do business with.

I contacted Jack after dealing with all the Austin/Georgetown/Hutto Ford dealerships; expecting to deal with the typical shiny boot, belt buckle clad, cigarette smoking salesman. I was pleasantly surprised when I spoke to Jack and he was just a regular guy, trying to earn a living, yet still willing to work a fair deal.

Jack beat the best deal I could find in Austin (by 2k), and in addition his finance manager, Mr. Gary Faust, gave an outstanding deal on a Ford ESP. I also was shocked that he could beat my personal bank's rate and get me financed at 1.9% for 60 months.

I came down to Truck City Ford expecting same treatment I had received at the big city dealerships; to say I was prepared for battle was an understatement. I left the place with a new car for the wife, and the feeling I actually came away with a fair deal.

I think the sales manager/head honcho even washed the truck because they were short car-hops? I got a kick out of that. :)

I can't guarantee they will always get my business in the future (Money is the ultimate factor), but I can promise that I'll start my search next time at Truck City Ford.

The price was so great we didn't hesitate to make the two hundred mile trip to seal the deal.   The addition of a friendly and very responsive staff was icing on the cake. The attention afforded us by Jack was excellent, he insured we got exactly what we wanted in our new F-350.  Gary was also extremely friendly and quick to find the right financing for us.  The entire experience at Truck City Ford was great and I would highly recommend them to anyone in the market for a great deal on a new truck.",5.0
277,"June 14, 2011","After an extensive amount of shopping, I found that Truck City Ford had the perfect balance of price, customer service, selection and knowledge to help me with my new truck purchase.  Jack was very courteous, knowledgeable and we were able to negotiate a very fair deal on a new 2011 F150.  When it comes time for my family's next vehicle purchase, we plan on seeing Jack at Truck City Ford first.",5.0
