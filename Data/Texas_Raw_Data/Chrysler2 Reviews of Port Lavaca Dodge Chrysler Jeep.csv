0,"February 01, 2018","My daughter traded in her Buick Verano for a  Dodge Charger in November.  The car WAS suppose to be financed by Chrysler Corp was what she was told.  Traded the Buick in, gave a down payment, had a co-signer which was her dad.  They had someone drive down to where we live so that my husband could sign the paperwork, got all his info, bank statements, DL, SS.  She starts getting calls from the company that financed the Verano that she was behind 3 months on her car payment.  My daughter explains that she traded the car in and got a new car.  The finance company tells her they never paid it off.  My daughter starts calling Port Lavaca Dodge and gets the run around nobody knew what was going on!  She speaks to the GM still nothing.  Then 2 weeks later they call and tell her she needs to take the car back because it wasn't financed.  Other people in our community had already said not to buy a car there, we should have listened!

1,"January 19, 2016",By far the worst experience ever! They sold me a truck and a month later called and said we had a better deal we needed to come in and discuss it and they asked for money a month and we said uh no! And they took the keys to our new truck! Who does that?! Any other company with any sense outta respect woulda sAid I'm sorry this was our mistKe so we will make it right and we will cover the mess up and make this right. But they took the new truck and kept our two trade ins. And had someone drive us home! Sorry company. Sorry service. Sorry business! Will never ever deal with them again! They are so shady and betrays customers and lies to you constantly! And doesn't keep you involved they do every thing so messed up and backwards! But with that being said atzenhoffer Chevy in Victoria tx heard about the bs port lavaca put us through and said they can help us get into something and will make sure that never happens again! And they got us in a brand new vehicle for an amazing amazing amazing price! Amazing service! Incredible people! Upfront! Honest! Helpful! Understanding! And took very good care of us! But I'm sure by now they are used to cleaning up after the port lavaca dealers! It's dealerships like port lavaca that give car salespersonnel and car dealerships a bad rep! But if you go to atzenhoffer they will change your whole perspective on car dealerships and that's a promise! ,1.0
