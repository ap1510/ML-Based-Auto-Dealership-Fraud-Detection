0,"January 12, 2018","The salesperson was great and patient. He listened and delivered. I was almost ready to sign when the finance guy ruined it all. I needed to upgrade my car for business purposes and told the dealer several times how much I loved my car and how much i didn't want to trade it in. It was my dream car that I wanted for years and last year I made it happen.  While working on the final deal with finance I mentioned maybe I should hold off until i can pay down my car a bit more and he said ""You mean the VW... that piece of crap?""  I walked out right then and there. I love my car. Not a single ding. Perfect condition. Well taken care of. It truly is beautiful but I need a 4 door for work. I can't believe those words even came out of his mouth.  Sorry to the sales person who spent 4 hours with me, was wonderful, and just lost his commission because of a rude person in finance!",1.4
1,"July 21, 2009","I got a new Sportage from Classic Kia and don't regret the purchase one bit.  My fiance and I had been searching for a smaller SUV and were first leaning toward the Santa Fe, but for about 10k less, the Sportage is every bit as sharp and driveable.  The Sales guys were friendly and pretty knowledgeable.  I recommend both Classic and the Sportage to anyone looking for an affordable SUV.",4.8
