0,"May 26, 2020","This dealership was a nightmare! I went there to look at cars and was pushed into buying one I didn't want.  The worst part about it was that it has scratches on the hood that you can barely see.  They have a cat that lives in the car lot. I believe they moved my car out of the lot because of the scratches and put it on the showroom floor to try to get rid of it.  They discouraged me from calling my insurance, and I found out that it more than doubled after my purchase.  No one cared about my concerns, and even hung up on me!  Stay Away!  I was told that my car had all of these awesome features, like a Bose Sound system.. and it doesn't have it!  Check the sticker and bring support with you.  Do not fall into their trap, they are desperate to make a sale. ",1.0
1,"May 13, 2020","After having an absolute horrendous experience at Service King for repairs.  I made an appointment with Ryan at Clear Lake Infiniti and have had incredible experience!  I haven’t seen service like this honestly ever, and this truly means the world to someone who has had horrible experiences in the past.  I will not forget how Ryan treated me, he is the best service advisor I’ve ever dealt with. A true professional, very smart, meticulous, precise, decent and kind.  I highly recommend asking for him.  Especially if you want excellent customer service and someone that is trustworthy.  He truly exemplified excellence in service integrity.   ",5.0
2,"May 08, 2020",I have purchased two Infiniti's from this dealership and I was in the market to buy another car for my wife. We saw a Q50 Sport that my wife like and after shopping around I found another car just like it with less miles and was also a newer model for less money. I call the next day and talked to Frank Arriola and told him I had purchased two cars there and my wife liked the car they had but I had found another car just like it with less miles and was also a newer model for less money and wanted to negotiate the price. Frank told me he had to talk to his manager and would call me back. He called me back and said his manager would not do anything on the price. I took my business to someone who actually wanted it and purchased the other car. After having been a loyal customer and then not even being given the courtesy to discuss the car and price with me I will never do business with them again. ,1.0

I had an appointment to discuss the possibility of purchasing a car and Lester gave me several options where I was able to leave in a brand new car! Excellent service!

7,"August 21, 2019","The following message is based on my opinion and a very bad experience with this dealer; but the reader should do their own due diligence before buying here. First off, I believe that this business is affiliated with John Eagle Auto Group in Dallas, which also owns the body shop that literally ""glued"" the car back together where the couple driving that car later nearly ""burned to death."" Read the story Dallas-Area Couple awarded $42 Million for Shoddy Repairs and Traps Them in Fiery Crash,"" which is horrible. 
But we did not know this before buying there. And so we traded in our car and they still owe us the money from that trade and now they are trying to keep that money by charging us storage fees. But even worse is that we have been fighting with this company for over a year.based on the fraud involving the 2 vehicles we purchased in August of 2018. We traded in our lease and this dealer returned that vehicle as a lease return to Infiniti so the factory came after us for thousands of dollars in ware and tare charges on a lease turn back even though our purchase agreement clearly shows it as a trade in. The other vehicle we purchased was returned for faulty wiring 2 days later, ""lemon,"" but as mentioned they kept our trade in. Anyway, they use the Shackleford Law Firm in Dallas to bully people out of their money and then hide behind arbitration verbiage so you will have trouble suing them. And most honest good lawyers will tell you do not sign anything with an arbitration agreement. People simply trying to buy transportation should not have to deal with lawyers and crooks. ",1.0

9,"November 20, 2018","Service department is terrible. Scheduled an appointment for service and was assured that there would be a vehicle available for me. Get there and my appointment was made for the wrong day and was told no cars were available. Spoke with the Service Manager Brandon and he said he would check to see what he had available. Brandon comes back and lets me know he has a car available but asks me if I could have it back the next day by 7pm. I've owned my Infiniti for the past two years and I have never had the service department give me a specific time frame in which to bring the car back, when no one has even looked at my car to see what all needs to be done in order to fix it. I agree to go ahead and take the rental car, whilst I'm checking out with the rental car receptionist, I express to her my concern over the customer service at Clear Lake Infiniti compared to other Infiniti dealerships. As I am doing so, Brandon ( the service manager) rudely blurts out ""well you can take it to another dealership then"". I was floored that he would speak to a customer in such a manner because of their mishap. He acted as if he was doing me a favor and was very rude and inconsiderate considering the fact that his employees made the mistake and that I purchased a service plan in order to be able to get a rental when my car is having issues (in addition tot the fact that I waited over an hour to check my car in). Go elsewhere to purchase and get service
on your Infiniti if you want to be treated like a customer should be at the time of purchase and there after.",1.0

11,"February 23, 2018","Everyone should know that when purchasing a vehicle, the paperwork can be the most time consuming, overwhelming and sometimes frustrating part of the process. With Clear Lake Infiniti, everything was an absolute breeze. From us walking into the dealership an hour before they close one night to signing the last document the next, this was the easiest and most comfortable purchase I have ever made. Laisa Segovia was the most welcoming, kind and knowledgeable Finance Manager we could have ever had the pleasure to work with. She went above and beyond to answer all my annoying questions and kept reassuring me that she was only there to help! Not only did she explain all of the warranty packages, perks and pluses in great detail but she helped choose the best payment scale - that’s a big deal! She is so personable; We even got side tracked a few times talking about our own lives but that just adds to her having fabulous customer service!! I would HIGHLY recommend her to anyone financing a vehicle from Clear Lake Infiniti! She truly deserves and award and we’ll definitely be back to buy another vehicle from her!",5.0

14,"December 28, 2017","I had been in the market for a great car at a great price due to my car being totaled after Hurricane Harvey. It was a challenge to find a good deal during this time, and I was beginning to get frustrated with the car search & negotiations that had fallen through at other dealerships. Then I came across a fabulous used Lexus SUV at Infinity. Clear Lake Infinity not only made the car buying quick & easy, but they were also willing to listen to my situation and worked with me to get a great deal. I am very pleased with my amazing SUV. Not only did Justin provide a quick turn-around with regard to all my questions. The manager, Michael, also worked with Justin to provide me with assistance regarding the affordability & servicing of the vehicle. The very day after purchase & servicing I was able to take it safely on the road for the 12 hour drive to visit my family for the holidays. This proved that both the vehicle & servicing carried out by Eric's team, were exemplary. This was the first big relief I had gotten since the hurricane damaged my home & previous vehicle...and just in time for the holidays. :-) A big thanks to the Clear Lake Infinity team!!",5.0
15,"November 20, 2017","I own a QX80 and took my vehicle in for 25k Service and check for anything else that it may need before we take a trip. At first it seem to be a good thing taking my Vehicle there for the first time however, communication was lacking, they stated they completed all the items I requested but yet fell short. I paid for the work but found out later the 1 issue was not taken care of.
Now like most people, time is money and I didn't have the time to bring my vehicle back a second time to fix a minor issue that should have been taken care of the first time. Now with that said, is the dealership a Bad Dealership, No but it did lose my business and here is why. I called the person I was dealing with in the Service Department and explained that the issue he told me was not done at all. He really didn't seem like he cared but only to say, bring my vehicle back so we can get it done. In a normal situation that would be fine but as I was leaving the Dealership he said to me,( You will get a Survey and if I don't get a 10, it will be bad for me so please give me a 10) I did tell him this morning that I will not be able to give him a 10 and he then seem to check out from his role as customer service representation of the Dealership. He said OK and that was it. 
I normally don't write reviews because most of the time no one cares but I felt like he could have gotten a 10 had he as others said ""Going the Extra Mile"" 
I am very disappointed in the first impression I received from Clear Lake Infiniti.",2.4

28,"June 29, 2017","I bought a 2015 Q50. I like the car but my experience with the finance person (Tran) was not very enjoyable. I was ripped off with all the extra add ons she added to my contract. You better be careful when dealing with her. She took $467.00 from my down payment to payoff my trade-in,but the payoff was only $390.00 so what happened to  the $70.00 difference. How about a refund? I bought the car on May 26th and they took out my first payment on June 1st. I probably need to make a call to the Texas Attorney General to see if this is legal. Just be aware of financing at this dealership. My wife and I felt very pressured to make the purchase.",2.0

30,"June 20, 2017","We bought a used car from this dealer and had a trying experience.  Their customer service is lousy.
We needed a car for our son who is out of state in college.  After much looking and frustration, we found what we thought was the right car at the right price.  After taking the car for a test drive and keeping it overnight, we discovered that it was lacking a spare tire and jack in the trunk. Upon returning to the dealer to make the deal, we informed the salesperson, manager and finance lady, that it had no spare and we would be shipping car out of state and needed the spare tire and jack.  This was Saturday and they said they could not get it today but would get it on Monday.  We stressed the fact that we had to have it on Monday because we would be shipping it out of state that week. To make a long story shorter. They did not get the wheel, tire and jack until Friday after the car was in transit out of state. Then lied that they had shipped it when the hadn't and wanted us to come pick it up. They then gave us tremendous hassle on sending the wheel tire and jack to our son where the car ultimately was.
Their attitude was that once they made the deal, they wanted us to get lost. We are in the market for a new car but will never deal with Clear Lake Infiniti again.",2.0
31,"June 12, 2017",Salesman and financing were great. The service Department did a great job fixing items that we requested but I don't feel they did a good job detailing the car.

69,"March 29, 2017","No, this is not the first car that I ever owned, but it's the first one that I have ever picked out for just me.
My parents bought a car as a teenager. Then we you are married you have to consider if it is the right car for both you and husband and later kids. So I never really picked out a car just for me. Now was the right time with kids grown up and husband gone
I looked at numerous cars at several dealerships. Some of the salespeople were downright pushy, asking too many questions trying to figure out what I wanted. Once armed with the information they tried to steer me to cars that they wanted to sell and tell me all the reasons why it was the right car for me.
When I was at Infiniti, salespeople were readily available, but they let me look in peace. 
When I sat in the QX 30, I thought, ""This is it!"" It was the right size and fit for me. The technology package was very alluring too.
Just to be sure, I visited the Lexus dealership as I have previously owned Toyotas. The salesperson was a bit rattled being new and didn't make a very good impression. Too be honest, I really didn't like the current look of the cars either. 
So, then on to the internet. I contacted the Infiniti internet director now knowing what I wanted. Within 30 minutes she contacted me. Information on two cars were sent to me. We made an appointment that afternoon. After considering both cars, the fully loaded one won out! I feel that I got a great internet discount, plus a bit for a trade-in, and 0% APR. Who knew Infiniti could be so affordable!
I absolutely love the car and the way it drives. It looks great too.
Thanks for helping find my dream car so quickly and easily without any hassles.

154,"July 06, 2016","This negative review is for the dishonest Service Department. We dropped off an Infiniti M45 because the radio was not working and we wanted to get it reprogrammed. Service Advisor, Robert, called me and told me that in their attempt to reprogram, they realized the radio controls were no good. I went and purchased new radio controls (with the part number he gave me) and took it to him. When I took it to him the technician came out and looked at it, to verify I had gotten the correct part number. When he came out he said that he had told Robert it needed the actual radio control unit (it’s the control unit behind the navigation screen). Robert then looked confused. The technician then said that he would swap that out because he did think it could also make it work since it contained a different module that he had to also program in order for the radio to work.

So we brought him a used radio control unit and after they programmed it, he said the radio control unit was no good. We thought that was kind of odd since the radio was working before we took out the other vehicle but figured maybe it got damaged so we went and purchased another used radio control unit. Robert said the same thing with the second radio control unit that it was no good. So we returned that radio control unit and swapped it with another and took it back to him and he said the third radio control unit was no good! So we went and got a fourth radio control unit from a different place and took it back to Robert for him to tell us again the radio control unit was no good! After the fourth time, we realized two things (A) They are trying to force us to purchase a new radio from them or (B) they improperly diagnosed the vehicle and there has to be another problem other than the radio control unit. We expressed to Robert and the manager how frustrated we were because there was no way that all 4 radio control units did not work especially when we witnessed two of them working prior to taking them up there. Robert and the manager did not care and won’t release our vehicle until we pay them $1000 for the reprogramming! They told us we are just complaining to try to get a discount! Who says that to a customer? Nobody in their right mind would want to pay $1000 for a repair that did not get completed. Currently the vehicle is still in their possession and my lawyer is in the process of filing a formal complaint with numerous consumer organizations which will follow with full legal action.",1.0

When I arrived Friday , atmosphere was so professional , my sales agent Derrick Moss was a honest , patient guy. The General Manager was also helpful . They never seem to rush or talk down to me. I purchased my vehicle Saturday 4/18/15 , 2015 QX60. I loved the service provided to me and my family by everyone there , it was a awesome experience and I know my husband was looking down from heaven knowing I was honestly taken care of.

161,"August 15, 2014","I bought a Certified Preowned G 37 a couple of years ago and was very , VERY happy with the sales staff and service department. The car is fantastic and a great value too so I decided to bring a friend to the lot to look for a car for her. Zaman greeted us and was very friendly and professional. It turns out they had a similar G 37 with fewer miles and nicer package and I ended up swapping rides! Fair prices, friendly staff and service under the leadership of Mr Jeff Stone is why I will be coming back again and again! SMP",5.0
162,"December 20, 2012","I have been beyond pleased with everything from purchasing a car to customer service afterwards. Rob Halik was AWESOME and sincerely wanted to make sure I was and AM completely satisfied with my Infiniti G37 (which I LOVE).   He has addressed every single issue or question I have, even after my purchase.  I just call him anytime I have a question regarding my car, and he's such a sweetheart... Doesn't seem to annoy him.  By far, this is the best experience I have ever had in purchasing a car and I am not exaggerating. Buy from Clearlake Infiniti and you won't be disappointed!  Thanks Rob and thank you Clearlake Infiniti!!! ",5.0
163,"July 23, 2012","I am writing this review becauseI have just completed a very gratifying used car purchase experience at Clear Lake Infiniti. I was greeted by Mr. Jeff Stone, Internet Manager,  who was very accommodating  and helpful. Mr. Stone guided me through the dealerships pre-owned inventory, sharing unique insights about each car I showed interest in. He was extremely knowledgeable about each car, even those that were not from the Nissan Corporation. Once, I narrowed my choices, I dealt with Mr. Stone exclusively and he guided me, step by step, once I decided to purchase a pre-owned Lexus. Mr. Stone was straight forward about the cars I reviewed, and very thorough yet caring as I completed the purchase.  I highly recommend Jeff Stone and Clear Lake Infiniti to anyone wishing to purchase a car.

164,"April 28, 2010","My wife purchased an Infiniti G35 from Clear Lake Infiniti before we were married.  She always loved the car and plans on keeping it for a long time.  Knowing that fact and now that we are married I figured it was time to step up and make sure it was getting the proper servicing it requires.  

So I took it in for a transmission flush at Clear Lake Infiniti as well as a brake job.  I mentioned that it had not been flushed since I have been with my wife, and that it needed to be done.

The service tech leaves to get me a price on the brake job and comes back with it and informs me that they will not do a transmission service on our car.  Through my jaw dropping baffledness I ask why?  He responds that they do not want to be responsible for it.  Im still not sure what that means.  I then asked what he recommends I do and he advised me to take it somewhere else.  I laughed a bit and informed him that we bought the car there, that we were currently looking at their SUV's there, and that it is a dealership and they should have no problem working on their own products, all to no avail.

So I balled up his $700+ brake job quote, gave him a smirk and walked out.  Now we are shopping Lexus SUV's.

Note: the car is all stock, has 70,000 miles on it, and was bought at Clear Lake Infiniti.

Ridiculous.  Never have I heard such absurdness.",1.5
165,"March 12, 2010","I have just purchased the second consecutive Infiniti from Justin Galbraith, my salesman from Clear Lake Infiniti, and I couldn't be happier with any aspect of my experience.  He knows his product to the finest detail and does a fantastic job of finding the right vehicle for my preferences.

I've found their service department to be overly-accomodating; they are constantly exceeding my expectations of how willing they are to go the extra mile to keep me as a future customer.  Sam Alhalaby (the service manager) runs a tight ship and rarely fails to greet me by my first name every time I visit.

I recommend Clear Lake Infiniti to everyone and look forward to years of fantastic driving experiences with a staff that is anxious to assist me whenever I need them.",5.0
166,"November 17, 2009","I purchased a car from this dealership in 2004 and have taken it in for major service milestones ever since.  I have always been treated courteously, offered a loaner car, had issues explained to me and never felt pressured to have extra service jobs performed on my car.  The service reps are polite and have contacted me in a timely manner.  All together, this dealership is a pleasure to work with and I recommend them to my friends.",4.6
167,"July 15, 2009",Purchased 2005 FX35 from this dealership and have had my car serviced (recalls & oil/std.maintainence) there and have been treated fairly. Loaner cars when necessary w/o any of the usual headaches associated w/getting a loaner. Always respectful and even informed me of a warranty issue regarding my dash that I thought was my problem. I will continue trading w/this dealership.,4.2
168,"September 23, 2006","I am having an annoy experience with the customer service at Clearlake Infiniti of Houston, TX. Want to share this experience. Please be aware, avoid this dealership if you don't want to be buying an infiniti and getting the customer service of a Chevy.

I traded in a car titled under my mom's name, an purchased a 2006 Infiniti G35 program car at this dealership.  All sale and licensing paperwork I signed indicated I purchased the car and the title goes to me. As I was signing the paperwork for the title application, Kyle Deng, the finance manager facilitated all the paperwork told me that by paying $50.00 having the dealership to get the title, I can save myself a lot of hassle and extra leg work. At that time, I did not know how comical and ironic his comments were.  

When I received the title, it was under the wrong name: my mom's name was on the title instead of mine. I realized this must be a simple error, I thought that one simple phone call would solve the problem.  But I could not be more wrong. I left messages on the Finance Director, Kyle Deng's voice mail for three days in a roll (Friday, Monday and Tuesday), explained the situation and asking him to simply give me a call. Heard nothing.  Went to the dealership on the fourth day, but Kyle was out for the day, talked to the sales manager, Macros, he asked me to writing down all my information again and promised to pass it along to Kyle. Then, no response again next day. Start to leave message on Kyle's machine again for another two days, total of 5 messages and one visit, still not heard one single word from Kyle or anyone from the dealership.  After a week passed, I was really aggrevated with this ""Silent"" treatment. and called their switchboard and insisted that I have to speak to Kyle.

When Kyle got on the phone, not only there was no apologies, he was short with me. Asking me to explain to him how could the paperworks I filled for title apps. was under my name but the title went to my mom. How funny...  As I start to complaint about his lack of response, he blamed it to miss communication between him and the sales person under Marcos (funny Marcos did not see it that way when I went to talk to him) and practically hang up on me.  

I finally called the General Manager.  He apologized for Kyle, and promised to resolve the issue next week....so, I am crossing my fingers and hoping that will happen next week.

In summary, if this dearship can make a simple clerical error into a two week long aggrevation for a customer, think about what would happen if you really had some problem with the car, and require the dearship to cough up some serious money to solve you problem... 

One more thing that was even more comical, as I was fuming about not receiving any phone replys from Kyle after 3-4 messages, I received a fruit basket from the dearship to thanking my purchase and asking me ""not to heasitated to call them"" how funny.
