0,"May 10, 2020","Will never buy at this dealership went in to the service department to get my back up camera checked walked out with 4 sensors on in my car nothing was done about it. Their explanation was that something else needed to get fixed and that’s why those sensors are on, mind you when I left my car I had no service indicators on took to solely get the camera checked out and paid $175 for them to tell me that my camera took a hit and was not under warranty estimate to fix it well you can imagine!! Regardless expect to pay $175 any time you go in just to get a diagnostic done on your car which by the way is not clearly explained to you! I have extended warranty which by the way I have never heard of an extended warranty only covering part of your repair. In my opinion they sell you the car and after that they could care less of keeping their customers satisfied. It also took me calling the dealership 3 times just to be able to talk to someone about my warranty. Left a message twice and never got a call!",1.6

14,"February 17, 2020","They under valued my trade in and sold me a car with moldy odor  from the carpet and AC, I inquired about prior damage and they told me there was none.
The  price negotiation wasn't a fair process. we hadn't agreed on a price / payment before they ran my credit. and they wouldn't return the keys to my previous vehicle.
I felt left out of the process.
I can't recommend Audi San Juan.

31,"November 07, 2019","I cannot say enough good about my experience with Audi San Juan.
Everything was conducted over the telephone, with no problems.
Audi San Juan is many miles from Austin, where I live.
I was dreading the drive or flight from Austin.
Amazingly, Audi San Juan told me that they would deliver my new car directly to my home.
They arrived in a beautiful trailer with my car.
The front of the trailer had a beautiful picture of an Audi R8.
The trailer was also clear on the side so that you could see my car.
I purchased an Audi TT-RS.
This is a fabulous sports car that is unbelievably fun to drive.
I currently own 14 cars and 13 motorcycles.
I own everything  from a Ferrari F12 Berlinetta, to two awesome mini coopers, jags, Astons & Lotus's and I have to say, that for the price, the Audi TT RS is the most awesome car I have ever driven.
I bought it as an all wheel drive bad weather car and have fallen in love with it.

The guys that showed up at my home were very, very terrific, courteous and knowledgeable.
I unreservedly recommend Audi of San Juan, and the splendid Audi TT RS, what a car!  ",5.0

36,"October 02, 2019","It's obvious Audi San Juan promotes a corporate culture that is built upon a great customer experience and courteous staff.  

My salesperson, Alex L., handled the purchase and trade-in of my vehicle in a very professional, courteous manner--not pushy or intimidating.  The entire Audi staff bent over backwards to make sure I was comfortable with the various decisions I made associated to the purchase, trade-in,  financing, and delivery of my vehicle. The 9:15 PM delivery (I live 263 miles from the dealership)  of my vehicle the next evening was quite impressive since it was delivered on a truck that elevated the vehicle, had glass sides and high-intensity lights that really showcased the vehicle for the entire world to see. The man that delivered my vehicle was also extremely nice.

The Audi service team was very welcoming from the time I drove in to the service department for the vehicle's window tinting to the time I left with a loaner vehicle. Their technological capabilities were top notch and really helped expedite the service requisition and car loaner process. My vehicle was promptly serviced and I was called when the vehicle was ready for pickup. 

Kudos to the Audi San Juan Owner, Management and entire Staff for a job well done from sales to service!

38,"October 01, 2019","My experience with audi has been nothing but lies.. I feel I was lied to since the moment i walked in. I was told my trade in was too old and I couldn't get anything for it when they sold my car within 3 days. I was given the car I purchased after 5 days of them having it. They had said they had ordered parts and tires from Europe since the car I purchased is from over there. Come to find out, the parts were there all along. When I get my car back, the sales guy (alexis) drops off my car on empty when i was promised a full tank of gas and dirty.  And it just continues.. the tires they put on my car were used and also the warranty they sold me is just for them to make money. Very dissatisfied with them.

52,"June 18, 2019","I saw a Q8 advertised on Ebay that caught my eye and it took 3 phone calls to the dealership to get someone to talk to me about it, I was told it was the on-line department and someone would call me back, I was told the vehicle was not at their location and someone would call me back and finally I spoke to the General Manager that stated it was his car and the deal was made.
 When I asked if the car had any damage or anything I should know about, I was told about the aftermarket items and I was invoiced and the 2019 Q8 was purchased..... being that I live out of state I used a enclosed transport company to deliver the car and upon arrival the small rock chip on the passenger side of the front window was discovered and the large rock chip and crack was on the driver corner of the windshield, I contacted the dealer immediately with photos and after a couple days was told that only the large and small chips were there and not the crack therefore they offered $1,000 towards the repair...... Mind you it is a $2,180.00 repair at my local Audi dealer as there is $800 of camera alignment/calibration.... How do you sell a highline vehicle at a franchise dealership and not disclose a damaged windshield and the car only has 3100 miles on it??????
 If I had the opportunity to do it all over again SAN JUAN AUDI would not have a penny of my business!!!!!",3.4

So then I received a bill for $144.  My question is, why did i get three different prices?  Is there no set price on the maintenance of vehicles or do the employees make up their own prices as they please?  I do not understand how a business can be run that way. ",2.6

188,"December 19, 2018","It's difficult to answer the question if whether I would recommend this service center after my last experience because I have always been satisfied and pleased before. This review is only based on one event so please allow me to explain why I chose to answer Yes and 4 stars when I feel like answering No and 2 stars. I called in about a week ago to have my vehicle serviced for what I thought was a slow leaking front left tire.  Everything goes as scheduled as far as the pick up and loaner drop off. I get an electronic service repair estimate to accept or decline repairs and I decline the replacement of the engine and cabin air filter along with the recommendation to replace the two front left tires.  I was not prepared to make such a purchase and had only expected to have a flat repaired.  I receive a call from the Service Advisor (SA) and we begin to discuss the issues with the car.  I ask if the flat repair was made to which he answers no due to the fact that it was not a puncture and that it was actually caused by a missalignment.  By the way, the repair technician had failed to add that to the repair order.  The SA advised tires still had 4/32 tread and would be good for a few more miles. Exactly how many, I don't remember exactly but around 1000 miles or so so I ask for the car back. I also asked for pictures of the tire which the SA greed to send to my email after I gave him my correct email address (email on statement was incorrect and still incorrect).  Once I receive my car I am able to see an approximate 6"" long by approximately 1/8"" separation gap on the tire which appears to blow out at any time.  I immediately call SA  and ask him why he did not alert me of such a potential hazard.  He apologized for having ""accidently deleted"" the pictures and states, ""That's why we recommended to change out the tires"".  As casually as recommending a minor air filter change that has no hazard/danger potential to the public. To say the least, I feel the SA did not have our best interest and safety in mind.  Maybe he was not completely aware of how bad the tire condition was.  What good is all the technology of texting an advisor and electronic statements when you still have communication gaps.    
Overall I believe you all work very hard to provide the best customer service possible. Thanks.",4.3

Salesman that met me as I drove onto their lot, ""Johnny"", is well schooled on differing models, and their inventory.  The one big mistake was he showed me so many different models that he got confused and told me that my selection came with seating and mirror settings saved in memory for quick change purpose between drivers. Which is important to me as my wife (short) and I (tall) share the car. After delivery I discovered I had a beautiful new Audi Q3 Quattro without the memory as ""verbally"" promised.  Was not listed on the window sticker. I am reasonably sure that this feature could be added, but got the cold shoulder when I requested it.  I made the purchase without haggling over price or trade value, so I know they had plenty of profit to provide this upgrade. Did enjoy another cookie while waiting for the unsatisfactory response.

330,"November 30, 2017","If you are considering buying a car from Audi San Juan, I would advise you reconsider and purchase your vehicle at another Audi dealership.            

Up until the time of purchase, the customer service was excellent. After signing, I received probably the worst customer service I’ve had to date. 
              
- The day I went to pick up my car I was told it would be ready by a certain time. I arrived promptly at that time, and my sales associate was gone. I waited for 45 minutes before someone finally assisted me. 
- The car tucked in a corner of the lot, not presented in glass doors as promised. 
- The car had 1/4 tank of gas, not full as promised.
- The car was dirty. I traded in my car and had to wait 4 days for it to be fully detailed and the trunk was full of dirt.                
- The loaner car they gave me was an upgraded version of my car, and my sales associated admitted prior that it was a mistake and would leave me resenting not buying the newer more decked-out model (which it did). I expressed interest in upgrading and was not helped until much later.
- My sales associate told me I would not be charged for the gas I used on the loaner since I traded in my car with a full tank and sure enough, was charged a couple of days later. 
- There was a dent in the hood of the car!! They said they would “fix” and they did so by merely painting over it. 
              
I regret giving my money to this facility. I feel cheated and under-respected. If I could do it over again, I would not buy from Audi San Juan. ",1.2

333,"May 31, 2017","We were over whelmed with the kindness in which we were treated.  We could tell from the inset that this dealership employs honesty and treats their customers with respect.  They went the extra mile for us.  A classy dealership to say the least, for beyond others that we visited.  Well done!",4.8
334,"May 23, 2017","I was in the market for a new vehicle. I started online of course. As a busy mom, I really didn't have much time to sit and wait at a dealership. I saw a couple of vehicles  that I was interested in and submitted my application. I also called and got in contact with Gracie. I told her my situation, and she made everything so easy and conveniently for me. I went in one afternoon to test drive, and purchased my car during lunch the following day.",5.0
335,"April 26, 2016","After purchasing my Q7  in July of 2015 my salesperson misinformed me regarding an additional services I paid for which was for oil changes and windshield protection.  I've traded my car in after 8months and I've tried to get a reimbursement for the oil changes plus windshield protection plan but have been met with obstacles at the dealership.  Phone calls not returned and being told that the plan goes with the car, why would I pay $2200.00 for someone else to benefit from my losses.  Not only did the car depreciate $20,000 in less than a year I'm out the money paid for the additional services.  the Q7 still has a bumper to bumper warranty since it was traded in with only 8,000 miles on it. All in all I am very disappointment with the dealership's lack of professionalism, giving misleading information regarding reimbursement policy, plus unethical practices from their sales personnel.",1.0
336,"April 25, 2016","They will say ""anything,""  as dishonest as it may be, to take as much money as they can from the customer.  They do NOT practice ""world class service.""  They will not prorate the extra fees they collect for service if you sell the vehicle before its  expiration date/mileage.  Beware!!!!  Do not buy the extra oil changes or windshield protection.  The first two years of oil changes are ""free.""  If you pay for future oil changes, they will take place after the first two years.  If you sell the vehicle before the first year, they keep the money you paid for the future oil changes and will not prorate the windshield protection policy.  They will not tell you the truth at the time of purchase.  They are the most dishonest dealership I have ever dealt with.",1.6
337,"March 28, 2016",The sales person did not seem to know the spec of the car he was trying to sell. He did not know if the car is supercharged or turbocharged or if he even know the difference between the two.  He told us that the car is rated at 550 HP where everyone knows that the car is 333HP.  We agreed on 72 month but the contract ended up being 75 months. They also added some other stuff which we told them we don't need. We bought the car last month and it is already paid off. This is just a warning to future audi buyers here in the valley.  Don't go to Audi San Juan. ,1.8
338,"March 18, 2013",Dorian was great to work with.  He offers EXCELLENT service. We went back two months later for a second car!  I love the whole Audi experience. Cannot say enough good things about Dorian. He gets ten stars!,5.0
