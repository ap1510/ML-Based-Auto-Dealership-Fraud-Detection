We asked several salemen & employees questions and they stopped to answer them or went to get the answer. It was refreshing to see all the Employees here work as a TEAM!! I referred them to everyone I know and will continue to. Thank you Southway Ford for a friendly and pleasant experience in buying our F150 Ford Sport Truck!! We made the switch to Ford and love our Truck!!! ",5.0
28,"April 23, 2020",Very disappointed with warranty repairs on my truck. Carpet underlay was ruined due to condensation leak and they refused to replace it. Truck now stinks. Also discovered a dent on one of my doors that was not there when dropped it off.,2.0
29,"April 23, 2020","*BUYER BEWARE*
First off let me say that when I first found my vehicle it did not have a price so I went ahead and called I was told “X” amount and that the vehicle had just been traded in. When I got there I was greeted by a sales representative who had cleaned the truck up which I appreciated. I explained to them that because it was used as well as a diesel that I would like to get it inspected by my mechanic just to ensure this is worth my time. He explained to me that the vehicle also will go through inspection before they are ready to sell, but he let me take the vehicle for 48 hours for the inspection by my mechanic which I appreciated. Before I could return the truck I got a call that someone else was also looking to buy the truck. I said I was still interested but I will go ahead and wait for the truck to be inspected by the dealer before we talk numbers. I was explained that the only way the sales price would change is dependent on how much money it would cost to repair things on the truck. So i got to the dealer and It must have been only 30 minutes and he came back with only one issue that the truck had (needed new batteries) I was surprised that the inspection was done so quick but more to my surprise was how many things the dealer missed when Conducting this inspection.  This whole time I had been under the impression that their inspection would take at least a day which i would have been fine. He then goes to tell me that this negotiation process is unfair because my mechanic had the vehicle for 24 hours. The sales guy explained to me that he was unsure how much they could repair due to the fact that the service center was closed, and instead of holding off till we got prices, he had the audacity to tell me that the other person who would want to buy the truck would pay the price without the repairs. How could a sales individual or dealer be comfortable selling a vehicle that had many mechanical and safety concerns and just sell the car as is? Then he mentioned that because of the time they could not put a hold on the vehicle and they couldn’t guarantee that it would be there the next day.  In order to make the sale he talked to the manager and stated they would write up a contract and repair everything needed that was addressed by my mechanic with the condition that i could not negotiate the price. This tactic put a lot of pressure on me due to the fact that this left no negotiation which is what the reason for me delaying to buy the truck. After talks I agreed to their terms and would have all the repairs done before I took delivery However all I asked was if if they could a replace a manufacture step board (FORD) that had been broken. He explained that the company could not eat $800 and that the price was nonnegotiable. At this point i was so uncomfortable i wanted to get the deal over with. When I arrived home I went the the dealers website to grab the Vin for my insurance company.... my heart dropped when I saw that the price had been changed by $1000.00 lesser....after the dealer said the price would not and could not move. This just goes to show the amount of integrity this dealer has towards its customers. How can they say the price is nonnegotiable however the same day that I signed papers the vehicle price has dropped by $1000.00.  To me this is not right. This has taken money out of my wallet.  To those who are looking to buy from this dealer be very cautious. I would recommend if you are buying used to get your vehicle inspected by a third-party as they only do a 30 minute inspection before putting a vehicle for sale. Also do your due diligence and check their prices as often as possible, as you can see in my experience I signed for a vehicle that was less online the exact same day I bought it. I would hate for anyone to put their life in Jeopardy or be put in a financial bind due to the sales tactics of this dealership. Note: I addressed these concerns with an assistant manager and was told i would hear back from them to make things right. I have not heard anything....",1.0

75,"August 27, 2019",The customer service at the service desk is poor.  Men are sitting around staring around and customers have to get their attention to get their attention.  We are already stressed out because our vehicles need repair much less to struggle to get someone to help you. For a huge dealership like Ford the service men holding up the walls there at the desk need customer service training. After I received my vehicle back the technician completely tore off my sun visor off my windshield I was upset about this. The young man named Leo at the quick lane is very attentive to greet customers.,1.6
76,"August 26, 2019","We spent an entire day there, a whole day, and they were unable to help us until the last 1/2 hour before closing only to LIE about everything we discussed, from payments to costs to down payment amount. Our sales guy was swapped without our consent and we were told we had no choice but to accept the new guy. Then they swapped cars on us at the very end of the deal and gave us wrong vin numbers for insurance. They lied about total costs and forced us to skip car detail because everything was closed. After posting an honest review they offered a bribe to ask us to lie about our experience and change our review from a 1 star to a PERFECT 5 star. Worst customer service ever.",1.2

124,"February 25, 2019","On Saturday, February 24, my wife and I met salesman Anthony (Tony) Juarez at the Southway Ford dealership. Tony had text me the day before and had mentioned to let him know ahead of time when we were going to be going to the dealership so that he could get the F-150 Supercrew ready for viewing.  He met us promptly, and after introductions took us to the vehicle. He spent the next 30-45 minutes giving us a fantastic presentation on the truck; its features, how they operate in detail, and many options I did not know were included on the truck. After his presentation he asked us if we would like to take it for a test drive which we did. Needless to say the wife and I fell in love with the truck. When we arrived at the dealership Mr. Juarez requested if we were still interested in purchasing the truck, we stated yes and proceeded inside to finalize the purchase. I had already done some extensive research on several trucks at other Ford dealerships, and had obtained a Letter of Approval at my credit union. Mr. Juarez told me the price was what was listed on the internet with all the rebates listed. No ""hidden""costs or surprises.  It took about 1.5 hours from start to finish. My wife and I were very impressed with Mr. Juarez's patient and professional demeanor.  I will definitely recommend your dealership and Mr. Juarez to other possible. As a matter of fact I gave my Credit Union representive one of his cards. He is looking for a used truck. I hope this review helps Ford obtain and hire more people like Mr. Juarez.

Frustrated I got online and looked for other dealers. Saw South Way’s low prices online and gave Jose a call. I was still torn between EcoBoost or GT, economical fast car or not so economical but still not bad on gas even faster car? After Julian and I test drove both car I decided to look at pricing. Sure enough their pricing online was the low pricing they were giving me so I went for the GT and sure happy I did. They got me out of there quick with my brand new car.

152,"November 30, 2018","First time visiting Southway Ford on Black Friday while on a holiday visit to SA. Our salesman, Daniel Martinez was very knowledgeable and helped us find the exact truck we wanted. We felt very comfortable with him and he answered all our questions. We did not expect to be purchasing a new truck, just looking to see what was out there. We love our new truck, but the only thing I am unhappy with is the Diamond Extended Warranty that we bought through the Finance Center at the closing of our purchase.  We did not receive any information with our paperwork detailing what it all covers, so we now feel that it might have been an unnecessary expense. Our insurance covers most of the repairs like windshield damage and fender / doors dings and dents, also this plan was really too expensive. I give Daniel Martinez five stars for his professionalism and great customer service on this review. The service department did a great job in prepping our new truck so we could drive off with it.

He was straight up front throughout the entire process and was able to work with me to get me into a vehicle.  One recommendation I have for people is to reach out to him before you go if you have doubt, ask what paperwork(Paystubs, utility bills, etc) and realistic buying goals.  Their website offers a finance calculator to gesstimate your payments and buying power.  Having experienced bad salesmans and sales tactics Rory turned the situation around and together he helped me drive away with a vehicle.

182,"May 09, 2018","We just purchased our 4th car from Southway Ford ! A beautiful Explorer and we got a great price ! 

 Roger Reyna was the person who helped with with the sale and I highly recommend him! Unfortunately we WILL NOT BE RETURNING to this dealership to purchase another Ford. After purchasing this car we discovered an EXTREME amount of RUST in the undercarriage. The GM has agreed to replace the muffler and exhaust system which we are very grateful for. But shortly thereafter we discovered that there is LOTS MORE RUST EVERYWHERE. For a brand new car this is totally unacceptable. The GM told us he would help us out and open up a case with Ford and assured us he wanted us to be happy with our purchase. When we ourselves spoke to Ford we learned the same day the GM NEVER OPENED UP A CASE, never even sent pictures of the Rust and salt build up.  We opened up a case and when the Regional manager called he based his decision on what the GM at the dealership told him. So clearly the GM Mr. Dove DID NOT ADVOCATE for us. He explains it as being SURFACE RUST and it will not damage the car.  Again for A BRAND NEW CAR ANY RUST is not good. We have talked to friends, neighbors, etc etc and they are shocked when we show them our pictures.  Calling Ford is a waste of time also. The Regional manager reports to someone higher and he refuses to tell us who that is.  AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE. THEY ARE SO DISHONEST AND DO NOT HELP THE CUSTOMER OUT. We have purchase 4 cars from Southway and customer loyalty means NOTHING to them.  Such a huge dissapointment. My parents are in their 70's and the stress and helplessness they feel is so overwhelming and are AFRAID TO DRIVE THE CAR - they fear it is NOT SAFE.  Even though the GM said it is safe - would HE APPRECIATE DRIVING A CAR WITH TOTAL RUST - WOULD HE WANT ANY FAMILY MEMBER DRIVING A CAR WITH THIS EXTREME RUST !  Ford must not take pride in their products sending out a car that has such bad RUST and now they refuse to do anything about it. We are making monthly payments on a HEAP OF RUST .  If Mr. Dove would have spoken for us the CUSTOMER - we may have been able to resolve this but he was looking out for HIS INTEREST AND THE DEALERSHIPS.

198,"November 02, 2017","Matthew Lindstrom was an amazing car salesman. Him and the finance team got me an awesome deal for the vehicle I purchased. I’ve been to other dealerships and they seemed to try to manipulate me but Matthew was honest, upfront and worked with what I was asking for regarding vehicle and financing. Everyone was friendly and respectful. Matthew never pressured me into making a deal, he allowed me to think about the commitment I was making. This was my first time at Southway Ford and it will definitely not be my last. I love my vehicle and the experience was wonderful. Thank you! ",5.0

209,"December 30, 2016","As always, I took my F-150 in for an oil change and I had another great experience.  I drive 40 minutes to this dealership when I have the option to take it to a dealership that is 5 minutes down the road.  I guess I like great, quick costumer service.

211,"December 24, 2016","The personnel were great. Very friendly and professional. They made themselves available and met my automotive needs. I was looking for a new Mustang to replace my 2006 Mustang. They didn't have the color I wanted but I found a color I liked and what it did not have they addressed. The actual purchasing process was fairly painless, but still some waiting. I didn't count on that since I was already had pre-approved financing. My biggest issue would be communication. That at times was not the best. It either wasn't clear or I misunderstood and as a result I got upset because my expectations were not met. This was all after the sell of the car. It was concerning some detail work that was added to my car and some incidents that were involved during the work. When I have to complain, then something was not communicated correctly or clearly or something is just wrong. All in all, like I said the people were friendly, just did not make me happy all the time. I will not even talk about the Service department at this time. If I included that on this the rating would not be 4 stars. It would be a lot lower.",3.8
212,"March 05, 2016","On February 27 ,2016 we took our Escape in for an oil change we arrived at 7:10Am for a oil change and it took 3 hours to do the oil change.   After the tech had already taken our vehicle off the lift and outside the service writer called us to the counter and asked us if we wanted the oil filter and injectors replaced.  We said yes and I asked how long it was going to taken.  The service writer said 30 more mins   We didn't  get out from here until close to 12pm.  The service is good but the wait time needs a lot of improvement.    We are here again today for an oil change on our f150 lets see what time we get out today.  Ford needs to work on wait time for a simple oil change. ",3.6
213,"October 05, 2015","Albert Ramirez  and family would like to thank Mr. Mac Haik's and employees especially Tito, Rick Medina, Richard Trevino,  Anthony Butcher and Daniel J. Kneifl for the awesome job they did our extended warranty had expried when we had transmission problems and these gentlemen went to bat for us so we could get a discount on our truck and it worked they knew we had an adult with Autism so they went beyond  the call of duty they are truly family oriented. Thank you and God Bless ",5.0
214,"April 11, 2011","This was the worst experience I have ever had buying a new vehicle.  I sent a request for an internet quote and got one on the truck I wanted to buy.  I went to test drive the truck I received the quote on and negotiated a price.  When I received my paperwork from my bank they put a different truck on the purchase order.  A truck that I had seen or drove.  I left messages for the Sales Manager and the General Manager and neither of them have called me back.  I have filed a complaint with the Ford Corporation about this dealership.  Very unprofessional, I would never recommend Southway Ford to anyone looking to buy a vehicle.
