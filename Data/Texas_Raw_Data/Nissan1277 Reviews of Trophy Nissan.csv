Unlike other Nissan dealers in the Dallas area that advertise with misleading prices to get you in the door Trophy Nissan has clear upfront pricing. No hidden prices just good honest pricing whichb is a rare find.

Our salesman michael did an outstanding job as well. I have purchased a lot of vehicles from many different dealers over the years and Trophy Nissan stood out as someone I would come back to again.

My car started leaking  fluid and I managed to get some on a cardboard to show them. I live 60 miles from Throphy and got there at 7 am. I explained  the issue to the service person. Several hours later they called and said they could not fund the leak. They said the car set overnight (wrong) they only had it a few hours. . They never looked at the cardboard. I drove 60 miles to pick it up and was told my car was being washed. (Wrong) right after I was told that a young man went to get my car and was never washed. I got home and my car is still leaking.

242,"March 28, 2019","I was dropping off my 2016 Maxima to get a sensor looked at and was so impressed by the courtesy and efficiency of the service department- especially Justin Hulen-that I went over to the sales department to see if they had any good deals on their latest Maximas. I met Brandon Dueitt who did a great job of recognizing my needs for a car and put me in exactly what I wanted. I thought the negotiation period was handled in about the right amount of time and I was given clear computer generated numbers to help along the process. In finance I was treated to not only respect, but also fairness by Natalie Garcia as we went over the fine points of the deal. I also want commend Manager Kyle Krause and General Manager Jennifer Carrol-your work made this deal materialize. You all worked hard with me to get me in a brand new Maxima and I will never forget you. In fact, I will see you soon as you have earned my business! 
Is summary, I have 2 words for you: thank you! From service to sales to finance to the manager level to the general manager level, you showed me respect and courtesy. It was a total team effort that produced a brand new Maxima in my garage. ",5.0

They will lie and deceive you to come into their dealership just to sell you cars that do not even come close to what you came their to look at. Then when they do wrong, they will do nothing to fix it.

Andrew Maritim was straightforward and honest; I enjoyed doing business with him. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another car from Trophy Nissan.,5.0
609,"July 29, 2017","Simply put, we came back to Trophy Nissan after the way Montaz Ibraham handled a very uncomfortable and startling incident.  While we were negotiating our deal, an irrate customer attacked a salesman and a fight broke out between the two in the lobby.  It was intense.  After the fight settled, we left--never to return.
During the incident, and after, Montaz was the epitome of professionalism.  He called my wife and I back apologizing; there was no pressure put upon us to return and finish the deal.  The following morning the manager called apologizing, and offered us more for our trade--but again, no pressure to return.
The previous offer was nice, this counter was a generous gesture.  We countered again, and ultimately are very happy with how they handled us, and the sales transaction after the incident.  I returned that evening.  Shortly upon my arrival, the manager stopped in, shock my hand, and thanked me for coming in.  The finance manager, Cesar Maciel, was excellent as well (and a Cowboys fan).  Of course, no one can control an irate customer's choice to attack a salesman, but all in all, our interaction with Trophy Nissan turned out good.
Again...Montaz Ibraham made the difference.  I would definitely work with Montaz again.  I gave my overall review 4 and not 3 stars because of Montaz.  ",4.2

The cherry on top was that 30 minutes after I was heading to a different dealer he calls and says he had New Car prices in mind.  Im not sure if it was an excuse, but he said it was only his second week and didnt know what cars were available.  For a seasoned sales person like you, it's a must to have an updated list on what cars are coming in and out. Dont bust my xxxxx and waste my time and then try and make up for it by calling and trying to have me come in to waste my time even more. 

Here's a tip; if you're not willing to do your homework to make a sale, check your website.  Your coworkers have already set a good starting price online for you incase you're to lazy to look it up yourself. 

Oh but its ok. There is also the chance that you were following protocol to squeeze every penny out of the customer before you actually even show them a vehicle.

692,"February 28, 2017","And so a car buying story begins….

Tawas  a late winters  day when a young lad decided he wanted to try for a new car.  Refund season was upon everyone and the lad the time was ripe for getting that new car he’s wanted. For you see, a new car is something he had never had before. And so began my story…

“A researching we must go!” I thought to myself. I knew what kind of car I wanted, a Nissan Altima, but not much else. So a gooling I went. I googled here. I  googled there. I gooled high and low. Until I  found what I was looking for…

I’d found 2 options. I could go with the 2015 model and get one used for $16k or pay almost $30 for a 2017 model. “Dem Texas drivers be CRAZY” I thought. “I need dem der safety features like predictive cruise control and emergency braking” came to my mind and with that the decision was made. A new 2017 2.5SL with Technology package would be the car for me. But where to get one….

A googling I went again, this time for a dealer. The first thing to pop up was a car searching site that required you fill in your info to see the deals. Not knowing it would send my info to local dealers I filled it in just to see the deals. And that was when things changed…

I finished looking and decided to google some more but was told dealers would contact me about their offers. Thinking “I’ll just ignore their calls” I went about googling then checked my email. Trophy Nissan had emailed me about my interest in a new car and asked me to call them. Thinking “I don’t want to deal with a pushy salesmen. They can email me or drop contact” I replied saying I was looking only for information and to speak through email instead. Again Trophy Nissan sent an email requesting I contact them and this time I decided this would end, sending an email reply stating if email communication wouldn’t work that I was sorry but I wouldn’t become a customer. “They’re not going to reply. Salesmen only want to talk on the phone” I thought happily. But they did reply….

To my amazement Trophy Nissan replied with all the information requested, including average cost of down payments ($1200 to $2500), the available car that matched his search, and more. But what was better was that the salesman seemed to understand not wanting a pushy salesmen and was very polite. But I had done my googly woogely and knew there was better prices out there then what was offered by Trophy Nissan. Knowing dealers hate when buyers claim lower prices but can’t furnish proof I went to magical google again, finding not one but multiple lower prices for the same car at other dealers.
“Well it’s time to check out the competition” I thought as I was sure Trophy Nissan wouldn’t match a price almost $4k lower than theirs. But trying is everything and I replied asking if they would price match the competition, sending the links along as proof. 

To my surprise, they offered to match the price of the competition. With Trophy Nissan now at the same level as the competition I decided it was time. Time to go see Trophy Nissan in person.

At Trophy Nissan I meet the man behind the emails. I meet a few people actually. The email man - Charles Traylor, the salesmen who would take it from there – Andrew Riggs, and a lady we’ll call “The finishing lady”. Introductions were made and Andrew took me to his desk where the talking began…

Andrew, a nice, young, strapping, lad was polite and explained the process to me. Being the first time in a dealership I anticipated being bombarded by pushy people. But Andrew wasn’t ever pushy. A little heavy on the “give us a 5 star review” side of things, but never a pushy salesmen. He engaged in small talk and I felt like I was in good hands, just like the AllState guy.

The process continued and what I expected to be quick trip turned into hours. Charles and Andrew worked with the banks to get a loan for me, never giving up. After a while a loan was approved and things got a little tricky…

Still being polite Andrew returned to me informing me that the price quoted in the email was not the price I got approved for. Saying “Because the bank” Andrew informed me that the price before taxes and fees would be $2,000 more than the quote. I became worried I was getting hustled at this point, thinking back to what the price quoted included. But I couldn’t remember if the competitor’s price included special deals. So with the price being around the competitors price and still being in the range I originally wanted to pay, I accepted and thought ”I’ll see a breakdown of what the price is later and make my final decision then”. Andrew went to finalize the options and came back with a paper outlining the down payment and loan payment options, asking me which I wanted to go with. Again I was surprised, as the amount of the down payment was $5k minimum, a hefty amount larger than specified in the email. But I didn’t have great credit and chalked the high down payment to my credit score. Choosing the least expensive down payment option the time with Andrew came to a close and I was sent to the “finalizer” who would handle the final paperwork.

The finalizer as well call him, since his name is not remembered, was another polite gentlemen. Greeting me with a handshake and welcoming manor he went over everything and started the paperwork. The first line of business was finalizing any questions. This made me worried as there were still 2 questions not yet explained and it felt like time was running out. But thank goodness for the finalizer, because the first thing he did was go over everything and ask me if I still had any questions. “Sure. 2. I was told the price is higher because of the bank but why exactly is that? And some of the cars features were shown to me already but is there a list of features I could see? I want to make sure it has what I expected” I said thinking the finalizer would just give the same info as previously stated. But without waiting the finalizer got up and said he’d get the answers, walking out of his office and coming back with Andrew. “Oh no. I’ve gotten him in trouble” I thought upon seeing Andrew. “He’s going to start telling at me about how he’s already told me this info. Wait for it….” I thought. But Andrew did not “blow up” or cash me outside. How about dat. Andrew explained that because the bank used was not Nissan I did not qualify for certain rebates, causing the price to go up. He then took me out to the car to show me the features and answer any more questions. Going back inside the finalizer continued where things got a little strange again….

The finalizer was quick and polite as ever as salesman could be. He went over everything and started rambling about extra warranty service that could be included and how much it covered. Saying things like “this covers any dents or dings, even if it’s from you” and “this covers all the electronics and this covers any spills on the inside” the finalizer laid out all the plans. About 5 coverages in all I listened to thinking “I won’t get any of these since it’ll be expensive”. Hiding the cost till the very end the finalizer finished and revealed a price….

$800 per month would cover everything. The loan and the extras. “Does anyone say yes to that? That’s almost double my loan payments of $583. Ummm let’s go with ‘no to the no to the no no no’” I thought as I politely declined. Not wanting to give up so easily though the finalizer explained he could get the coverages separate and asked which I thought were the most important. He then asked if I would be interested if the price was under $670 a month. I agreed and the finalizer left the office to find out the final price. He came back with good news. The price would be $616 a month and the interest rate would go down on the car from 18% to 11% since it had all the coverages. I just had to sign.

The finalizer laid out all the papers one by one, having me sign them. But the papers weren’t filled out. Thinking there was nothing to fill out I signed. Then the finalizer put each one through a printer where the info was printed on them. Thinking that was strange and a sly move I didn’t question it as a video camera was recording the office and any discrepancies could be brought up against the video. Plus everyone was so nice I didn’t think they’d pull anything as it would tarnish their customer service and reputation. *Awe look. So naive it’s cute* With the paperwork done the only thing left to do was drive home but there was one problem standing in the way….

The final part was get the car and drive off the lot, but first the finishing lady was to be meet. The finishing lady came out to meet me with a smile. She took me to my car and showed how to do things like use the radio and what buttons did what. A change in the mood was unexpectedly cast though as the lady did not offer the same politeness or feeling as the others. A sense of “why am I hear. Let’s get this over with” suddenly filled the car as the lady rushed through the buttons, speaking in a very straight forward, monotone voice speaking only to get the words out and not be actually understood. Looking elsewhere her body language was screaming “I want go home right now”. The finishing lady while not rude, made me feel I needed to get out of there. But the lady was only with me for a short period before she said I was free to go home as everything was now done. But the problem still remained. How would I ever get 2 cars home?

I informed the lady I needed to get both cars home and with that the lady went to find Andrew. 

*In steps Andrew to save the day* Andrew came out to offer to drive my old car home. I told him he could drive my new car since it’d be a better ride but he declined and said I should drive the new car and he’d gladly take the old one back for me. I gave him the car keys and expected him to follow me back but instead he said I could leave and he’d take care of getting the car to my place.

And with that I drove off the lot thinking “Oh god, is an alarm going to go off? Do they have to deactivate something? Is this going to stop working once I get away from the lot?”. Of course no alarms went off and I drove home in my new car. Shortly after I got home (about a 20 min. drive) Andrew called to let me know he’d made it. I went outside to find him with my car at the gate. He’d actually driven my car home for me! And it took 2 cars to get it home because a manager followed so Andrew could have a way home. That’s a lot more than I expected from a dealer.

But fast forward to now, almost 2 weeks later, and I got my copy of the papers I signed. I immediately checked the prices and found they actually match what I accepted. So I’m glad to report they didn’t charge me extra or pull a fast one. I am missing one paper for something I was charged for (the paper that explains what the coverage is) so I’m left wondering what exactly is covered. Also the coverage according to the papers doesn’t match what I was old as it’s very specific. For example, I was told dents are covered but in reality only dents smaller than half a dollar AND not on the edge AND not from hail AND ….. are actually covered. None of that was explained to me before hand and no brochure of any kind has been sent to me as of yet, leaving some coverages as vague as “we cover what’s in this section” and no further details. I’m hoping I get some brochures soon. So I feel like I was conned by a polite salesmen. Good news though, I have 30 days to cancel and get a full refund ($5k total) if I choose. So it’s not like I’m locked into something, yet. Also I was told prices in monthly payments instead of actual prices, a trick salesmen use to get people to sign up. Again though I have that 30 days so not that big of a deal.

In all I’m still deciding on how I feel about these guys. They were nice and Andrew went out of his way but that last lady and the lack of information on the extra coverages has me a little worried. So I’ll wait till it comes come for my first service and see how that goes.

We met with Andrew Riggs in new car sales.  Andrew, although a very young man, was really professional, knowledgeable and friendly.  Andrew showed us Trophy's current inventory of Nissan Titan diesels that we were interested in.  At no time did I feel rushed.  Andrew allowed my family and I to take the time we needed to make a decision on the color and trim we wanted.  Andrew took our current truck over to appraisal while we were deciding on what we wanted.  We fell in love with the Platinum Reserve 4X4 in the java metallic color.  Now it was time to negotiate the deal  I already knew what they wanted for the truck through autotrader.  I figured they were going to ""lowball"" me on my truck trade in.  I was shocked.  They were only $1000 under what KBB stated my truck was worth.  After just a short negotiation, I had my extra $1000 for my truck and the deal was done.  I walked into their FI department to finish the paperwork and was finished in under 10 minutes.  (I had my own financing in place)  I left the dealership with my new truck and a full tank of diesel.  I got the truck I wanted, with the price I wanted and a very smooth transaction.  I felt like a VIP.  Kudos to Andrew Riggs and Trophy Nissan.        ",5.0

786,"March 01, 2016","DO NOT PURCHASE A CAR FROM TROPHY NISSAN!!! I bought a 2014 Nissan Sentra from them not even 30 days ago. You drive up, there's multiple salesmen that swoop to ""help"" you. They then shuffle you into one of their many cubicles & you wait forever. The place is a complete madhouse. I was there for over 4 hours that day. They showed me the car I ended up buying, telling me all about their multi-point safety inspection & how great & thorough it is (NOT!!!). They really push a hard sell. You see sales model all over everything that they say/do--in the worst way. I noticed the flat tire indicator was on, I was told ""that will be handled."" I came back within 48 hours & purchased the vehicle (they call you constantly during that time, because they are extremely pushy). I paid cash, but waited another 5 hours that day to handle financing. After all the paperwork was signed, they told me I would have to bring the car back that week so they could do their inspection. Remember, they've had the car for days, & I don't even live in Mesquite & they knew I was commuting 45 minutes to buy the car, & they told me the car would be ready when I came to sign that day! So, I refused to take possession of the vehicle until it was inspected as I was promised & I was given a full report on the service (never received this report, they gave me a copy of a service order & that's it). A few days later the car was ready, I came to pick it up. Again, more waiting (there abt an hour & a half). No floor mats in the vehicle, I was told they would be ordered & shipped to me--this never happened, even though I followed up multiple times. 

I leave thinking, thank God this ordeal is over (I had been T-boned which is why I was having to buy a car in the first place--they knew that)! NOPE!!! Driving home I discovered a blown speaker, & a blown fuse for the car charger plug-in (couldn't charge my phone in my car). Within a week, I had my first flat tire. I took it to the Discount Tire down the street from me, there was no key to take off the lug nuts so they couldn't take the tire off without breaking those, & they couldn't see any nails so needed to take it off to look into it further. So, they filled my tires every few days with new air until I could get back out to Trophy Nissan (like I said, their place is a complete MADHOUSE--plenty of reps, no one helping. After having already spent so much time there I was hating the thought of having to go back, EVER). Within less than 30 days I have had 5 flat tires. I finally got the car back out to Trophy Nissan, I was there 2 more hours, they got me a key (which I should've had to begin with), & I told them to check the tires & they said everything was fine. The next day, I woke up & had ANOTHER flat, same tire. So, I took it back to Discount Tire now that I had a key, they evaluated my tires, 2/4 had low tread. The bad tire needed to be replaced because they'd put in a bad gummy patch. Like I said 30 DAYS AGO I PAID CASH FOR THIS CAR & NOW I'M HAVING TO REPLACE TIRES!!! I called Charlene who I'd been working with at Trophy Nissan trying to handle repairs, she passed me on to Mario, he passed me to Victor, he passed me to Eric. Eric told me they will not replace the tires because they do not warranty tires, EVEN THOUGH THIS WAS AN ISSUE I REQUESTED BE FIXED BEFORE I PURCHASED THE VEHICLE! It's completely baffling. 

When you tell them there's an issue, they tell you how sorry they are & how important it is for them to take care of customers--I have found this to be summarily FALSE! These people are just greasy salespeople looking for the next sale. They will not help you & they will cut every corner possible. Every ""sorry"" & ""I understand"" is followed by a ""but."" It's completely inexcusable, & they'll agree with you! But they won't do anything. You will not be heard & your time will be wasted. After I asked them to replace the tires & they said they ""couldn't"", they also gave me the option to return the vehicle. I will be taking them up on that offer the second I have another chance to take MORE time off from work. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THESE PEOPLE!!! Terrible service! The worst I've ever seen!!! & I've worked in customer service!!!!! The way these people do business is shameful. Never again.",1.4

This was even after they hit my credit with 9 hard inquires and I had also purchased a Rogue for my husband in May. I found and fell in love with a 2013 Altima Sl that was fully loaded. After it was said and done I wrote a check for my down payment and ended up having to pay an extra $150.00 extra a month in car payment. That was fine. I go back in yesterday to finalize and finish the paperwork and the nightmare began! I was told that the finance company who ""approved"" the upgrade price no longer could do it anymore and that I had to go to the New cars to find one that they would finance. After they tried to increase my car payment to over $700 a month and $15,000.00 more than what the total price was for the one I wanted, I walked out and told them ""NO!"". Went back over to the used area and asked to speak to the manager. To my absolute dismay and heartbreak, they did not want to sell me the one I fell in love with, was financed and had been driving for over a week now. If they weren't going to be able to sell me a higher value car, then they weren't going to sell me anything. I ended up leaving with my previous car and my down payment back. They are the most scamming, lying, deceitful individuals that I have EVER met. Please buy your next vehicle somewhere else. It would be for your own good.

It had a strong chemical odor, that made me a little sick.  I decided that I would come back in a couple of days to purchase the vehicle if they are able to remove the odor.  The last person I spoke with, apparently a higher up, in his effort to convince me to purchase the car that night, was patronizing and offensive and left a bad taste in my mouth.  The whole place seemed in a state of confusion, the people that I contacted less than professional.  It turned out that the 2014 that I had agreed to but was about 15 k over retail per Edmunds.  When I was on my way to purchase it, thankfully i received a call telling me they were not able to remove the smell.

905,"June 09, 2014","I called early this evening to see if they had a particular vehicle they had advertised on their website still available.  After speaking with Thomas, he confirmed the vehicle was still available.  I told him I was going to drive right over.  I drove across North Dallas for 40 minutes to get to the dealership.  Upon meeting him, he wanted to fill out an information sheet.  After that, he asked me to wait while he went to get the vehicle I was looking at.  After about 20 minutes, he had not returned, so I walked around to the back of the lot and saw him wondering around.  Once I walked back into the office, he told me the vehicle I had driven 40 minutes to see and had called and confirmed within the hour was no longer there.  As I was not happy, he told me they had a similar vehicle that was 2 years newer with about the same mileage.  Oh, but he couldn't get the key till the morning.  After I told him I was not going to return and they had one chance to find something to compensate for my time, he went and pulled up a really filthy car that was nothing like what I had originally gone to see.  He didn't even know the price of the car he had dragged over to show me.  He then asked me to go with him to see if there was anything else I would be interested in, and lo and behold, as we passed the vehicle he claimed he couldn't get the keys to, there was an employee about to drive it.  We test drove the vehicle, and I was interested in the truck.  After we went into the office, he came out and offered to me at a price higher than what they have it advertised on their website!  Little did he know that I had already studied their cars available and had see that truck at the lower price.  Hmmm, I smell bait and switch tactics.  Even as I finished my test drive, we pulled in and one of the other salesman was staring at me like I had stolen the vehicle from him.  I don't know who has the conscience to claim they run that dealership, but whoever it is should be very ashamed of the establishment they run.

906,"April 21, 2014","Customer service is severely lacking at TROPHY NISSAN.  At this point, I'm so disappointed.  There has never been any sense of urgency or concern for me, their customer.  

My father bought an NV200 a year ago.  It is a work vehicle for our company.  We waited on the vehicle for a year, instead of buying the Ford Transit, because Nissan sent out a publication, with a picture of the van with solid partition, with a window in it.  We explained to the  salespeople, atTrophy, why we had waited, and we were so excited.  We bought the first NV200 Trophy Nissan ever had.  We had to pursue the sales personnel about the partition, but they finally set us up with an up fit kit.  It was nothing like the up fit kit in the Nissan book.  The whole reason we bought the van.  Mr. Kelley, the salesperson for business vehicles knew nothing about the solid partition, this was never expressed before we bought the vehicle and now we well are into the purchase of the van.   Trophy did put in the up fit partition that has perforated holes for a window.  I'm an exterminator, and want to be separated from the chemicals I carry.  I don't want that awful thing they put in my truck.  You can't even see out the back of the van because the partition they had put in blocks the back window.  

After a year of going around about this, they are now trying to make it my problem, after telling me they were going to make it right.  I send emails and it takes days to get a response, if at all.  I have now contacted the Napahyde people and they tell me there will be a partition available mid-May, but it will be $695.  I don't think I should have to pay anything for it.  Trophy said they would take care of this.  I hate that a year later, they are not trying to make this right.  They should pay me for my pain and suffering.  It has truly been an ordeal.  I'm seriously considering legal action.  I love my van, but at this point I hate Trophy Nissan.",1.6

He said he was not coming off of the asking price (which was MSRP!!).  I let him know there was no way I was paying sticker price for the car and he sent me on my way.  I was willing to offer a significantly higher purchase price, but after my experience here, no thank you!! Customer service was horrible and rude.

909,"November 03, 2013","On September 14th, my fiance purchased a 2012 Nissan Versa from Trophy Nissan. We have regretted it since. 
When we test drove the car, we noticed some minor cosmestic issues which our salesman, David, promised would be fixed.  These issues included replacing the windshield, a broken hub cap, and repainting the back bumper due to major scratces. He told me the service department would contact me to schedule. Two weeks went by and I NEVER heard anything. I had to call and do the legwork myself for these things to be taken care of and even then, they were not taken care of completely. We were told to wait until the plates came in which was fine. 
During the time for the plates to come in, we started having major vibration issues with the car. Rather than drive down there, we took the car to Nissan McKinney. It was there that we discovered a broken motor mount. According to them, it had been that way for a while. At this point, we had barely owned the car for a month. It was also at this point that we discovered that we were LIED to about the coverage we had purchased for the vehicle. We left the dealership with the understanding that we had the maintenance package. Nope, we don't.  It was because of this misunderstanding that we are now responsible ourselves for replacing the cabin air filter which is FILTHY and the reason we have been smelling burning smells in the cabin. The finance manager, Mike, led us to believe and even said that we would be covered for this and basic maintenance.  Yeah, that was a LIE. 
It was at this point that we have NO faith in the car and were ready to give it back to the dealership and take our business elsewhere but we were about to be dealt another blow. After we get the car back from having the motor mount fixed, we took the car to an independent mechanic who would have no bias towards us or Trophy Nissan. We received the report back to find that not only were we LIED to about the car's maintenance records but we also now have a rear shock joint busted and leaking fluid everywhere. The mechanic was able to verify that this wasn't something that had just happened due to the amount of crusted fluid on the joint. He suspected the break had happened at least two to three months prior which would have been before we purchased the car. 
We already had an appointment scheduled for November 1st to have the plates put on and the cosmetic work done. The shock joint was repaired under warranty and the windshield replaced. However, when we picked the car up today, November 2nd, we did not have the plates installed, the hub cap was still cracked, the back bumper still scratched, and now there is a HUGE DENT to the front end that WAS NOT there when we brought the car in. 
We went across the street and talked to David about the issues not being resolved. He proceeded to get in the car with us and have us drive around the lot looking for a Versa to take the hub cap off of...which he removed with a crow bar from a car in the back lot. He also told us that despite what was PROMISED to us, the back bumper was not a big enough issue to take care of and that the dent wasn't their problem.  It was basically a big eff you,  we have your money and don't care now.
I know that Nissan prides itself on having certified preowned vehicles that go through a rigorous check but I think with the issues we have had we can pretty much prove that the dealership did not look this car over and just threw it on the lot with no regard for customer safety. Additionally, the maintenance was not up to date as David claimed it was which was proven by the independent mechanic we had look over the car. I don't want this car AT ALL but am now stuck with it because of the dealership LYING and FALSIFYING information to get the deal done. The saddest part of all was that this was the FIRST vehicle purchase ever made by my fiance and rather than being happy we are literally counting down the days until we are not upside down on the car so that we can get rid of it. He works his xxx off so that he can provide us with nice things and that has been marred considerably by this dealership. Believe me, if we could give the car back today we would.

911,"May 29, 2013","I went to throphy nissan because of the customer appreciation event. I got a ""free"" oil change. After they were done, i notice on the receipt that they were charging for the filter and the oil. Of course, being free i payed nothing. 

I open the hood, and i noticed, that the filter was not changed. How do i know that? Well, i bought my car there, very expensive, and with a pretty bad customer service(i can tell now, after buying two more cars somewhere else), and after buying the car i went religiously for every single service on my car. But, at some point, i notice that they were not changing even the oil. So i draw some line over the filter, included my signature, with a indilbe marker. After the service was done, i found that the filter was the same. Even though i was charged for it. The Cory Prevost was so rude, that i just throw the money and left. 

Since then, i just wonder, how many people are charged for filters? oil? services that they dont really do?

If you can, go some where else, and make sure that they do what they are supposed to do. (smell the oil, check the filter, etc).",1.4

They inform us that they will have new inventory the weekend (so you would think they want to sell this one) so we can actually get one of those.  We politely inform them we are not going over amount agreed upon.  Get ready to close the deal and the price keeps going up! We left and won't be going back.

I contacted this dealer via their website to confirm they had a Nissan Altima in stock. All I received back was an email from Myrna Travis stating the Top 10 Reasons to Buy From Trophy Nissan. I was very interested in the car so I called on my way to the dealership to confirm it was still there. Myrna's response was yes but either way we have 200 cars on the lot. I then said, let me be crystal clear I'm only interested in the one in question I contacted her about. She said yes. I also asked to her to confirm it didn't smell like smoke which she wouldn't respond to.  As I was driving from more than 45 minutes away I didn't want to waste my time. 

I pulled into the car lot with my family and sat there finishing my coffee. Before I could open the door a salesperson was at my car door like a vulture. I rolled own my window and kindly said I needed a few more minutes. 

A few minutes later we walked inside and gave him the stock number for the car. He came back and stated the car had been sold. The sales manager came and introduced himself as well. As you can imagine I was furious. I told him how unprofessional this was and his response is tell me what you want. I'll admit I lost my temper and dropped the ""f"" bomb when realizing this was just a bait and switch tactic to get me on the lot. 

I stormed out furious while the sales rep tried to get my wife to tell him what we wanted. She reluctantly gave him her cell phone and he called 3 or 4 times of which she didn't answer. 

This dealership represents all that is wrong with the Automotive Industry. Even the layout of the user car building was a complete mess with very small offices and hordes of sales folks standing around.

I was at Trophy Nissan on Saturday, April 14th and had a long detailed discussion with one of the sales representatives (Tony - he was one of the better representatives with good customer skills) and his Manager (Carlos). I had more or less fnalized on a 2009 Nissan Rogue that I wanted to buy (it was a SL AWD Gotham Grey with about 30k miles on it). It was priced at $20,889 but it was offered to me at $19,700/- with Pre-certification for 100k miles or 7 years along with a financing option of 3% through Nissan. I was looking to pay $19,000 for it, and could not take the offer. However last week on Friday, April 20th I called up Carlos again and told him that I was willing to come down and take the offer, since I saw the same car still available in the inventory. Carlos asked me to come down, but when I was there he asked someone else to attend to me and the person refused to extend the same offer and when I asked for Carlos they gave me BS that he was not in offic and had left for the day.

It was a bitter and horrible experience and I will never recommend anyone to shop at Tropy Nissan ever....

After telling them my budget was $350 they said I was on too much car.  We left and continued to talk by telephone.

940,"August 13, 2011","My complaint is towards the service and sales department: 

I went to this dealership based on reviews, television ads, and their online directory had the car I wished to purchase (one that is hard to find in the metroplex).  They called me to schedule an appointment and said on the phone that day that the car was still in stock waiting for purchase.  When I arrived I was informed that the car was sold weeks prior and the inventory was not updated.  This statement should have been my red flag to leave, but unfortunately, I was desperate for a new car and racking up huge bills in rentals; so I went through with the purchase of an excellent, different vehicle.  However, when I purchased the car they added about 5k more of things I specifically requested not to have in the price, but they lied and said they were not included, rushing me out the door.  Then when I returned to get the items fixed on the car that were meant to be included in the sale (scratches on the inside and outside of the car that were very noticeable), the whole staff, manager included, acted dumb; so that was a wonderful 3 hour experience on a Saturday arguing to have items removed from the original purchase price and arguing that I had a promised statement for the repairs to be done per our sales agreement.

Then, I wanted to get recommended tune ups on the car per requirements of my warranty, and I also had a needed repair on my car that only the dealership could take care of.  The repair was a piece of foam for the motor mount.  This items was something I could purchase and insert in the mount.  However, the sales/service representative explained that the part is purchased in a package, and it must be installed by the technicians otherwise I would void my warranty.  The part cost $125, but I understood that some things can not be avoided; so this is not why I rated the service so poorly.  The reason I rated the service poorly is because there was a recall on my brakes.  My brakes were perfectly fine, and the recall advised to bring in your car if the brake light came on.  I loved my brakes.  However, per the warranty and recall, I had to replace them.  The brake installation included cleaning out the brake fluid, new rotors, etc.  Not even one month later, I noticed my brakes were squeaking, loose, and not even close to the excellent performance of the brake I had on the original car.  I wrote it off in hopes that it would take time to wear them in.  I find out the real reason: they never cleaned the brake fluid; so I had trash running through my brakes.  I found this out when I went to Kwik Kar to get my oil changed, a shop I trust because they have always been spot on with my repairs.  Furthermore, they found this out without me mentioning my brakes as a problem.  Now my free upgraded brakes are not only worse than my previous ones, but they were also not free.

Bottom line, this dealership says whatever they want to get you in the door to rob you of money, including lying about items you are purchasing in both the sales and service area.  STAY AWAY!!",2.2

Couldnt give me a headsup so I could make arrangements to get a way back home.  The reason for them needing the car back was the false pay stub somebody at the dealership turned in.  Then when they called to verify the pay stub nothing matched so the finance company pulled.

This irked me a little bit, because I did not plan on requiring two days for this process and I had specifically asked that the car be inspected prior to me flying all the way to Texas. Also, the car was dirty! The seats had oil stains on them that could have been removed, and I had been assured the car was detailed, etc. - This was only the beginning of the headache. -- During negotiations of the price of the car, a manager (who was assisting Doug, I cannot recall his name, but I know he said he lived in Carrolton, TX) was the most aggressive, rude and inconsiderate person I have EVER encountered in buying a car. He made false statements, saying he would ""throw in the used car certifcation"" then retracting his promise, argued with my boyfriend when he called him out on it. As if the situation could not become more uncomfortable and stressful, he very condenscendingly talked down to us about the price of the car and what he could offer.  After several hours of this, we reached an agreement that the car would be repaired and ready for me to drive off the lot in the morning, so we went to financing to do all the paperwork. Financing wasn't too ridiculous, and after SEVERAL inquiries about the car being ready by morning, we completed paperwork, under this agreement. AS SOON AS WE WALK OUT OF THE OFFICE, our salesman tells us, ""sorry, but the part we need won't be here until Tuesday..."" this was just the icing on the cake, and I could not be patient anymore. I could not wait until Tuesday, I had work on Tuesday!! And I had no other transportation back to my home. I felt that it was very COINCIDENTAL and CONVIENIENT that they waited util all the paperwork was finsihed to drop that news on us, after we had been told all along that the car would be ready to go in the morning. It was dishonest, and completely unacceptable. After all of the events that unfolded I no longer trusted that Trophy would uphold their end of their commitments and asked for my down payment back. After about six different people intervened trying to diffuse the situation, we were told several different stories about ""we can take a strut off of another maxima and put it on and have you ready tomorrow"" or ""you can drive home with it that way and have it repaired at the Nissan dealership in Mississippi"" - etc. Bottom line, I would not accept or be happy about spending over thirty thousand dollars on a car that they did not care enough about repairing from day one. Finally, the used car lot manager ( I was told this was the head person in charge ) came in and VERY sarcastically said, ""I dont know why you are so upset.."" - I was so upset at this point I was practically reduced to tears, we were bullied all day long and treated like we were insignificant. This was when an employee from New cars came over and we went across the street and looked at new cars. -- Upon this encounter, I would NEVER reccomend anyone, even my worst enemy to the Trophy Used Car dealership.

968,"July 21, 2011","I had a good experience with my Sales Person (Ted Stratton) who is no longer at the dealership. I was not so happy with the Sales Manager or the finance people who tried to browbeat me in to a service warranty.

A few weeks after my purchase, I had the sport horn upgraded on my vehicle and had the license plates installed. The service appointment was disappointing and due to my experience, I switched my ""service/maintenance business"" over to Bankston Nissan in Irving. I found that the large service department at Trophy was too impersonal and I was treated like a number and I did not like that. Over at Bankston I am treated like a valued Customer and they call me by name, instead of ""hey you"".

I do admit that Trophy had a better price, but only because I had to haggle over a previously advertised internet price. It seemed like even though they advertised the price, they didn't want to give it to me, because ""that one is not available.""

In general, I prefer the smaller company with more personalized service. I'm sure Trophy does a great booming business, but I imagine it is based primarily on the low bottom line and volume.",3.8

977,"July 20, 2011","I traded in a leased vehicle ( leased from Trophy )  several months prior to the completion of my lease agreement for a lease on a new Nissan.  I had paid ahead 5 months on my current lease and after Ray called the Nissan lease office was told that I would be refunded all of the money I had paid in advance.  The amount was approximately $1500.00.  I talked to the person at the Nissan lease office while I was in Ray's office to verify that the monies would be refunded and was assured that it would happen as soon as I signed the lease on the new vehicle.

The long and short of my story is that it has been approximately 4 months and after repeated calls to the person in charge of the matter (Victor James) I received a credit on my current leae for two months payments approx. $600.00 and have been told that I will receive another credit next month of $300.00.  

During my discussions with Mr. James he said he was refunding the money only to maintain a good relationship with me, but it should never have been promised.  

The bottom line is I believe when this is all done I will lose between $300.00 and $600.00 dollars on the transaction.

I recognize that I should not have taken the word of some clerk at Nissan leasing, but was assured that I had nothing to worry about.

I expect to receive all of the money promised in the deal.

I know it was miscommunication on everyone's part, including my failure to insist that it be put in writing nevertheless;

This incident will still be fresh on my mind when my current lease expires.

983,"July 18, 2011","we decided to make the 100 mile drive from our home to your dealership on Monday, 6/13.  
 
Upon arriving, Chad gave us to Ivan. We had spoken with Chad &amp; emailed back &amp; forth before deciding to come.  Our first concern was when the car we had originally inquired about &quot;was no longer available&quot; after we were indicating we were coming to the dealership.  He said he had 'several'.  He quoted us a price &amp; when we asked about a new vehicle that indicated on website it was 'in transit' he said 'we want to sell you a vehichle; it doesn't matter new or used.  Yet when we arrived, the focus was ALL on used!  
 Ivan was personable initially, assisted us with the test drive, and subsequent paperwork.The vehicle we are purchasing has some bumper and rear panel damage that is to be repaired, along with window tinting &amp; your make ready.  He then gave us to your finance rep who printed off our forms, reviewed everything, and processed our $5000. down payment.  Ivan then took us over to the rental area and told us that our car should be ready Wednesday afternoon.  We were provided with a car to drive home.  
 
Tuesday Capital One called and asked for a copy of our bank statement to verify my social security deposit.  That was faxed to them at 11:30 a.m. 
 
At about 2:00 my wife called Trophy because she in on the Board at her church &amp; they have called a meeting for Wednesday evening.  She simply wanted to inquire if the car might be ready earlier or let someone know that she might have to wait until Thursday to pick it up.  (I work nights &amp; she is a full time student)  She had forgotten Ivan's name &amp; he didn't give us a card so she asked for Shayla.  Shayla was not available so another female in that department said she'd see if she could find out something &amp; call her back.  Two hours passed, and no one called. She called back &amp; spoke to Shayla.  She said she'd check with Ivan &amp; have him call us back.  He did not call.
 
Meanwhile, shortly before 4:00 pm Maria from your finance department called &amp; said that Capital One 'said they could not use the bank statement that THEY requested', they needed another letter of verification from the Social Security Admin.  Capital One had not called to tell us that.  My wife faxed the requested letter to Capital One &amp; called Maria to see if she wanted a copy faxed to Trophy.  She said yes; my wife faxed it and called Maria to verify she received it.  Maria thanked her &amp; said all was 'good'.  Since she had Maria on the phone, my wife asked her if she would mind helping.  My wife told her about her calls, that she just wanted to see if there was any possibility that the car might be ready early, explained about her meeting &amp; her (my wife's) concern that she might have to wait until Thursday to come pick up the car due to her meeting &amp; worried that we'd incur fees on the loaner if we delayed.  Maria was wonderful--she said &quot;I will find out &amp; call you back'.  
 
Shortly thereafter, Ivan called &amp; my wife answered.  I was sitting in the living area when she spoke with him.  His first comment was &quot;How are you?  She said fine.  He said &quot;well I've talked everybody in this place&quot;  my wife said &quot;I feel the same way&quot;.  Nobody called me back.   Ivan then proceeded to tell her that &quot;I told you the car might not be ready until Wednesday or Thursday.  Remember our 27 point inspection &amp; it had to go to the body shop?  I told you I would call YOU when it was ready.&quot;  My wife expressed that she was just concerned about owing for the loaner car and he told her he would not.  I could tell from her expression and her subsequent feedback about the call that she was not appreciative of the manner she was spoken to.  I was there when Ivan told us &quot;the car should be ready Wednesday evening&quot;. He said nothing about another day.
 
I do not appreciate Ivan or any other member of your staff being abrupt or condescending to my wife!   It should not have taken 4 different phone calls to get an answer to the simple question of the status of our vehicle.  I now have the perception that too many of your staff members are one peg in a single hole &amp; not willing to help with something if it is not their 'department or job'.  Our car was NOT ready as indicated, we were subsequently told that there was a 'parts delay&quot;.  Ivan said &quot;you DO realize this car is made in Japan &amp; we might have difficulty getting parts?&quot;  

We had our $5000 cash &amp; firm financing tied up in this vehicle for a week.  During this week wait we discovered through friends and the internet that this scenario is common at Trophy.  Furthermore, we also discovered that we could have purchase a BRAND NEW Nissan Versa with power everything (ours has manual windows, etc) for only $400. more than the price we were charged for our 2010.  It is certified, however, Chad or NO ONE at Trophy gave us an opportunity to look at new vehicles.  We were led to believe that the 2011 new cars were 'much more expensive' and 'would not be within our payment range'.  Yet within three days of our signing the final papers Trophy had at least 8 2011 Nissa Versas listed at prices less than or only $500 more than the purchase price we paid.   

If we had the financial ability, we would seek legal counsel about this snafu.  It is the typical 'used car sales' experience that we hoped to avoid.  

We tell ANYONE who we know that is car shopping to AVOID Trophy Nissan.  A friend at our church purchased a vehicle there three weeks before us &amp; had an almost identical experience.  We have also discovered numerous individuals who have shared their experiences on the internet.  Perhaps a class action suit is in order?   SOMEHOW this consumer fraud mill has to be stopped!

996,"June 08, 2011","We went to this dealer and had all our homework done.  When it came to crunching numbers the dealership thought that we were stupid.  They wanted to run our credit well before the number crunching was started, this is a bad thing for most people who do not need their credit dinged if the dealing process falls apart.  They had some very creative numbers to supposedly get a better price, but when you did the math (which they hope you don't do)it is not right.  The first area that upset us was the negotiation of the vehicle price. we were told that there was no incentives on the vehicle. We ""thought"" we had signed off on a $36750 price tag for a Nissan Maxima.  When the paperwork came to us the price was listed as $38750.  They informed us that they were giving us a $2000 rebate as an incentive.  This rebate is done AFTER taxes so we were having to pay an extra $125.  The price we negotiated for the car was a sham.  Then came the trade in value.  They kept telling us they were giving us $10094 for our trade in, but in reality it was only $9500.  They invented some cockimeme story about how they were giving us a tax credit of 593.75 that made the value of our trade this $10094 when in reality this is NOT a value, it is already a GIVEN.  The amount of the trade in already has the ""tax credit"" built in.  It was a lousy tactic to make it appear we were getting a great deal.  When we called them on it, we were told to have a great shopping around experience. (we did, we left there and went to another dealership that played no games and got a great deal!!)

Funny thing though is first thing Monday morning we were called telling us they were willing to meet our pricing demands, too bad they were too late.

Just found out the warranty we purchased was actually good until 100,000 miles but now the truck has 100,500 miles on it. We would have brought the vehicle in much more often if we had known the warranty had not expired, as it was constantly breaking down. Fuel level sending units, fuel pump, IPCM fuel management, catalytic converters, radiator mixing with transmission cooler ruining transmission. All these things are common problems and even my $1700 ""Gold"" service wouldn't cover a penny of it. Nissan corporate will not return calls. The flawed design of this vehicle and its siblings are something to be avoided. The long list of repairs for this totals about $5000. Hopefully everyone involved with this dealership will stay there and not infect other dealerships or brands. If you do business with Trohpy Nissan after reading this you are a fool and their perfect customer.

1007,"May 24, 2011","My experience was positive all-around.  My salesperson was very helpful and information, friendly and fun.  The finance guys worked hard to get me the best possible interest rate and the gentleman selling the extended warranty was very helpful in getting the price where I could afford it.  I wouldn't change a thing.  Thanks!

1009,"May 18, 2011","The reason why I am not rating high is due to poor managment not caring about the items being stolen from my truck while it was there for service. I had to call for four days in a row before a manager called me back to hear the claim from me. He told me that he will investigate and call me back. To this day I have not heard back from him. It has now been over two months. The only reason I will use Trophy Nissan is because of my extended warranty by not having to pay a deductable.

One of the salesmen in the used car division stopped and stayed with us.  I was following him in my car.  We drove to the collision center, and Jeff told us he would take care of everything including towing the car to the center.  The wreck occurred across the street from the collision center.  We left the keys and our phone number quickly so that I could get my husband to our doctor and subsequently to the emergency room.  Jeff was anxious to  get us away as quickly as possible and was efficient and thoughtful during this very stressful morning.  The car was repaired (@ $7,700 damage) and is working beautifully so far.  I have had the car back about 3 days.  I cannot tell you how exceptional the service was.

Everyone at Trophy is friendly and willing to address any concerns I have with my car or their service.  I really like being able to get my car washed at no cost even with just an oil change.  I've even been offered a free wash just because I'm a customer.

Over many years I've only had oil changes near my home.  Now I travel the extra miles to Trophy Nissan mainly because I like having service done by people with the knowledge and equipment to properly maintain my car.",4.4
1024,"May 02, 2011","Carl David has always provided excellent customer service.  He listens to my needs, and ""owns"" the entire process from check-in to work performed to check-out, ensuring things are taken care of to my satisfaction.  We had a rough time recently with some 3rd-party equipment and work done on my Cube at Trophy (Zaktek and glass), but he accepted responsibility for the work on behalf of Trophy and made sure everything was corrected.  The car we got back was in better shape than when we'd brought it in.

We own a 2010 Cube and a 2010 Rogue, both purchased through Oscar.  He's a great salesperson, and I felt confident that we were purchasing good vehicles for great prices.  No next day regrets.

We have excellent credit, and had no trouble getting the best financing through Nissan.  However, having to sit through a two hour+ sales pitch in Trophy's financing office while just wanting to get the paperwork signed was by far the worst part of the buying experience.  I may never purchase a another new vehicle just to avoid being held hostage in that little office.  By the way, they shouldn't lie and say that a part on their desk actually came from their personal vehicle.  The lie doesn't work when everyone in that department has an almost identical part sitting on their own desks.

Janet's manager confirmed the car was there and available ready to test drive. We drove 25 miles to find 15 sales men sitting around outside on the steps of the dealership ready to pounce. Manuel met me as I opened my car door and totally ignored my sister who was actually the buyer. We asked for Janet and Manuel wanted to note our names and phone numbers before he would get Janet for us (we had already given our names & numbers to Janet online). After disappearing to the back office for a few minutes, Janet comes out and we find that she is an online administrator - not our sales person. No women are working there except for the receptionist & admins and I feel sorry for them in that atmosphere. Manuel tells us that, OOPS, they sold the car ""late last night"". Even if it was true, they lied and no car existed as I asked it to be confirmed.

They showed me a ""dealer transfer"" car (wasn't as clean on the exterior as my Sentra), etc, etc. They did not listen to anything I said about what I wanted.

Contacted Trpphy Nissan via Internet first and then drove there. The difference was night and day. Trophy Nissan personnel were friendly, and listened to what I wanted (model and features). They gave me a straight forward deal: this much for your tradein, this much for the new 2011 Altima (features and color I wanted), so this is the net price.

My only complaint, if I had to list one, is that every time I bring my car in, I tell my handler that my name is spelled wrong and they assure me they will take care of it.

1054,"April 13, 2011",I went into Trophy Nissan interested in a used vehicle because I knew they tend to be cheaper. I owned a 2007 Jeep Liberty and still owed quite a bit on it so they sent me over to the New Sales department because the rebates offered on new cars would help with the negative equity owed on my Jeep. I was put in the hands of Samuel Meda. He told me what I needed to do in order to be approved for a vehicle. A few days later I had my down payment and went to the dealer to pick out my car. Samuel wasn't around so I dealt with Eli Martinez. I couldn't have asked for a better sales person. Eli was very friendly and answered any question I had.

Also I rarely get discount coupons from Trophy Nissan although I've been there several times for service.  I get more coupon offers from Grubb Nissan than I do Trophy.  I guess that's because I bought my truck at Grubb's but I give Trophy 99% of my service. The rare times I do get a discount coupon from Trophy their prices (for oil changes in particular) are much higher than Grubb's discount coupon for oil changes.

In the end my keyless entry was re-programmed, my tire pressure light reset, and my back windshield wiper inspected at no cost.  I was told that if I wanted the rear wiper fixed the back part of the door would have to be removed to really see what had to be done but would cost a few hundred dollars just to do that not including the replacement of motor (for the wiper) if necessary.

THe last couple of times I have visited, the dealership would have recieved more work (i.e. oil change) if they had listened more closely to what I said I wanted to have done.

After i was told that they could only put one type of expensive oil into my car and that it was $32 i was all ready depressed. then after they did their ""extensive"" 1,000,000 point inspection and told me the cost to fix innumerable small problems, i fell even further into my depression. i only gave in on one of the sales pitches, to get some hoses fixed because they were leaking fluid which had a negative effect on my A/C. i was willing to do anything to have a working A/C, well after i payed $200, i found out that those hoses didn't effect my A/C at all, and that my dad could have replaced them for $20. i was also under the impression that with said oil change they would also ""change out all fluids"". after a small bit of detective work,(my dad opening the hood and checking to see what was replaced), there was absolutely no difference in fluid change (except the oil). well over all i felt slightly scammed out of my money and really dont want to go back, but i need to go there for the sake of my car. even though its a Japanese car i still want it to last as long as possible.

I had visited many dealerships prior to Nissan Trophy, getting the run-around, the sales person not listening to my concerns or respecting my time.  Not so with Trophy, a truly professional company.   

Having purchased a number of cars in my time, this was a first for me, it made me a believer that integrity can be part of a sales experience.  If dealerships had these same high values, they might be some competition for Trophy.  Thank you Trophy Nissan, I'll keep buying my cars from you!

I had good experience with the purchase of the car, but I have a problem with routine maintenance, especially when they try to sell me services that I don't think I need.

When it went to the shop a few months later I was informed of several things that were wrong with the car.  These issues should have kept the car from ever passing inspection.  They also lost my registration and told me that I was wrong and that I had received it.  Only after threatening them did they offer to fix some of the issues.

It was going to be a lose situation for me anyhow. But the proof is that when they did the walk around inspection of my vehicle, Marcos did not point to damaged rims because they weren't, otherwise, he would have said something. Other than that incident, the dealer is ok  Marcos is a great guy, a real rarity in that place where all of the other agents try to avoid you, he'll ask you if you've been helped and what he can do for you.

The third party website listed the car much lower than the dealership was selling it for, and because of the difference in price we had to walk away from the deal.  The next day we got a call from Carlos (who we had worked with the evening prior) to say that they were going to get us in the car for the exact amount that we could afford.  This was much less than the listed price, they had to give us an awesome deal for our trade, and they had to find an extremely competitive finance rate.  Where most dealers would have just let us walk away rather than losing money or breaking even on a car, Mark and Carlos worked extremely hard to earn our business.  Our Nissan Murano is a dream car.  Mark was very generous with the time he spent with us, and he showed us the two cars on the lot that matched our exact specifications.

issues over a home loan modification that was resolved and we had documents to verify it, BJ told  us since we had paperwork showing the home loan was modified to go online and fill out an application so we did, BJ called us back and said she gave our application to Kevin her finance manager to review,Kevin called us back and asked about the home modification and said if we did have documentation he could get us approved before traveling an hour to come pick a car, we told him we had the documents so we made an appointment to go pick a car 1/15/2011, we travel an hour got to Trophy Nissan and went into the new car dealership where BJ got Kevin who got all our papaer work and income information, Kevin said we could go out side look at cars and he would go to the finanace department to get every thing squared away,He came back and said there was some good new and some bad news, the good news was we were still approved for a no money down loan but to stay in a low payment we had to go to the used car lot, we agreed he said he had a friend over there that would take good care of us that there were a few different choices in cars to choose from, we went over to the used car lot was passed to a salesman Mac who was told by Kevin we were approved for  no money down and the payment that we were looking to stay with in Mac said he would take good care of us again reassuring us that we would be satisfied with our experience,Mac shook our hand and Kevin left, Mac sat us in a glass cubical and said he would be right back to show us cars, we waited for so long that other people were asking us if we have been helped, We see Mac pull up in a Blue Nissan Versa he comes in and says thats your car, we asumed he was being a salesman and it was one of thecars to choose from, we go out side look at the car and says lets go for a test drive we get in the car and we start the test drive we ask Mac what other cars we had to choose from he said none this is your car, he said it was the only car we qualified for that's where it all started, we arhued that Kevin said we had a few different cars to choose from he insisted that the Versa was the only car, I told my fiance that I did like the carv so we agreed to take the car even though we did get to choose a car, Mac took us in to the building said he went into a room came out and said how much you putting down, we answered we were approved with no money down Kevin already told you that, he went in the room again and came out and was haggling us for a down payment after telling him again Kevin said we didn't need a down payment Mac replied Kevin is no more than me a salesman he can't make those decisions and went back in the room, Me being upset called Kevin and told him what Mac said Kevin was coming over to straighten it out and Mac finally came out of the room and said okay we lowered the price of the car to get no money down go get your proof of insurance, Mac said that he was going to go gas the car up that a person from finance  would be coming to get us to fill out the paperwork, we sat again for a very long time Mac came in and asked if any one came to get us we said no he went and spoke nto someone and with another short wait  a gentleman came and got us we filled out tons of paperwork some was explained some was half explained, we were told what our car payment would be and when the first payment would be due what we didn't know is there were two papers filled out that would change our experience for the worse, we were congratulated and sent home in the Versa, they called s the next day to  see how every thing was going, then we started getting calls from Sammy asking us questions about what we put on our loan application, we asked if anything was wrong he said no they were just reviewing information,a few days later we get a call from a Jennifer saying that we needed to bring them $3000.00 or bring the car back, we called Kevin to find out what was going on and he said he would call the used car lot to find out he then calls us back saying that there was debt issues, we went back and forth with Jennifer and Susie them over the $3000.00 that jumped to $4000.00 and back to $3000.00 we were told that we could bring a check for the $3000.00 that could be held for 21 days and then cashed after I got my income tax check we asked if we could swap the check for an air check voucher that we has applied for they said yes, we made an appointment for 1/28/2011 to take the check for $3000.00 for them to hold until the voucher came another hour drive we got there a young man Delvin asked how he could help us we said we were there to see Susie, he left came back and said he would help us he started a new batch of paperwork because they were getting the check from us, we asked him about the voucher and swapping it for the check he said hewould go check on that he came back and said no we couldn't because it wasn't present at the time  of the paperwork, we asked why they said we could he didn't have an answer, we willed out the new paperwork gave him a check for $3000.00 said he was going to get the form for us to sign to hold the check for 21 days, he left and was gone for a long time he kept coming in saying he was waiting for the form,while waitng our salesman Mac came in and asked us about us telling Kevin what he said about Kevin being no more than a salesman, I replied is that not what you said that he was no more than a salesman like you and he shook his head agreeing, finally Delvin came in and said we were not approved for the check to be held, we asked what do you mean not approved they had applied for another loan from a bank to pay them the $3000.00 that would then cash our check in 21 days, we were never told that it was another loan we were applying for until after the fact, then another gentleman came in after trying to get the 21 day loan approved on my fiance's bank account and we asked him why we were never told it was another loan we were applying for we never got any straight answers he then said he couldn't let us leave with the and we could come back when we got the clean air voucher, we explained we had no ride home so the gentleman told the salesman Mac to drive us home, during the ride home Mac was trying to apologize we explained we were not angry at him but we were angry at the whole situation, Mac sat in the back and said they discussed in meeting about giving people cars with no money down and then requesting money or the car back with in a week so this let us know it was a common practice to top it off after leaving the car at the dealer ship 01/28/2011 BJ called and asked us how the car was doing and if everything was okay we said what car you took it back she seemed shocked and said we should have called her needless to say when we got the air voucher we bought our car some where else.

1189,"January 14, 2011","I have brought ny 2008 Nissan Alitma in for service twice and both times the service people talked down to me and they were never able to find the problem.  The first time was due to me smeeling a warm coolant smell from the car especaily when the heater was on, a slip in the transmission and a popping sound the seemed to be coming from the muffler.  The first time the ""gentlemen"" informed me that the reason I was smelling coolant is because I must have overfilled it, when I had never added any coolany to the care.  He also told me that basically I must be unaware of how the Nissan transmissions work, and they could not duplicate the popping.  The next service was my car would not start and again I mentioned the popping sound that is coming from the muffler.  He said the fuel did not evaprtae and it was flooded for over 10 hours and that happens in the cold.  I informed him the car is garage kept and stayed around 50 at night. He informed me that there was no way that my garage at home stayed around 50 degrees in the winter I must again be crazy because he seemed to know about my garage.  I was required to pay for the tow on the unit to get it back when I still have the popping sound but the car does start now.  I spoke with the night manager Kevin and he promised to get to the bottom of the popping noise I was hearing.  He asked me to contact him the next day to make sure he had a rental car for me to use.  When I contacted him the next day he asked me if I was sure I even spoke with him the night before about this.  After he finally remembered our 45 min conversation from the night before he left me on hold for another 5 mins and in those 5 mins already forgot again why I was calling.  I have choose to not have my car services by Trophy ever again and since my warranty is almost up I guess I will just have to deal with the popping noise.  I have purchased 3 Nissan's from Trophy and while I still stand behind the cars I will not be buying my 4th Nissan from Trophy!",5.0

1191,"January 12, 2011","The reason for my visit was to upgrade my 2006 Titan king cab to a full 4 door Titan.  I received a call from Thomas and gave him the numbers that I could afford and would not pay more than that.  After I rejected the first offer on the first truck which was too high I continued to receive offers that were more than I told them I would pay on the same truck and the second truck.  I was assured from the beginning that they could get me into the truck with the figures I gave them.  I was extremely irritated after sitting in that dealership for over 4 hrs trying to get them close to what I told them I'd pay!  Each visit to Trophy Nissan has been the absolute worst experience I've had buying one of your trucks!!  My first visit to the dealership was soured by the incompitance of the service department!  They lost my truck for an hour when I returned to pick it up after finalizing the paperwork.  My most recent visit I had to deal with salesman giving me the run a round for four hrs!!This visit was by far the worst of the two visits!  I love my Nissan Titan but I really don't like going there for service or buying a vehicle!!

1193,"January 11, 2011","Although I had already received this questionaire about an earlier visit, I have to tell you about what happened to me tonight at your dealership. 

When i started my car this evening, it was suddenly running terribly. The car would not idle and kept dying. 
I had to have my car for a pretty important photo shoot tomorrow, and as i drove to the dealership, I was concerned that it was too late for them to look at my car and get me taken care of before closing. All the way there, the car died at ever light, and at tiems, I wasn't sure I would make it there. 

When I arrived, I looked for Danny Slatinsky, because he has always taken such good care of me. Fortunately he was still there. I told him the problem, and he said he thought he knew what it was. We went out to my car, lifted the hood, and he took the time to show me that an air intake hose had come loose, causing the problem. He got a screw driver and fixed the problem and told me there was no charge. I was in and out in less than 5 minutes! 

This guy is an incredible asset you your dealership, and I felt I should tell you about it. I wholeheartedly recommend your dealership anytime anyone asks. 
Keep up the good work!

Thanks,

Second, the salespeople were more than friendly and worked above and beyond ot get us the best deal possible.  Third, the service department is unbelievable.  We have owned Ford, Dodge, GMC, and Chevrolet vehicles in our time and have never found a better service department.

They also seem to be cutting corners by not topping off fluids or perfoming the multi-point inspections at each scheduled service. You are paying for a service and not receiving the full service for which you are paying. As an example, I have been going to trophy Nissan for a few years now and have yet to have my door hinges lubed which is part of the scheduled services. This situation is very frustrating because my service advisor is great, but the work is so sloppy it's disgusting. Also, the service department doesn't seem to be properly managed. I have addressed my concerns before and no one at the management level has ever apologized. Even as I waited for my car to be fixed from the mechanics sloppy work, no one ever apologized. ",4.8

When they called for the pay-off of our trade-in, no one from the dealership bothered to tell the old lien holder that the vehicle they were calling about was to be traded, therefore costing me another needless payment on the trade-in vehicle. The dealership tried to blame their mistake on myself. I am NOT in the car selling business, they are, and they should have known to tell the old lien holder this was a trade-in! Also, the car traded in had handicap licenses. The dealership knows or should have known that handicap tags stay with the person, not the car, and they charged me $75.00for registration, although the vehicle registration office said that charge should not have been made because of the handicap tags. I haven't heard a thing from the dealership responding to my numerous calls. What kind of idouts work in the back room? They are a disgrace and shouldn't be in the positions they have.

1202,"January 07, 2011","My experience with Trophy Nissan (5+ years) has been pretty consistent. During the warranty period I always took my Quest(which has been an excellent car)to the dealer. The work they did then and have done since has almost always been well done. The only exception was when someone broke the driver's door window (and the power mechanism)during the night and I took the car to Trophy to be repaired. When I got the car back, the inside of the door was full of glass and the arm rest was loose. When I took it back, they put everything right with no charge.

Since the end of the warranty period, I only take the car to Trophy Nissan when it needs a service that the dealer is much better qualified to perform. My experience has been that, if left with a free rein, the service department will pile on non-essential services and fees that can pad the bill by a good 40-50%. Even legitimate work is overpriced. Parts and mechanisms are replaced instead of repaired. Much of what is done appears calculated to extract the maximum payment possible from the client.

In this, Trophy may not be much different than most dealers. Money, not service appears to be the bottom line in much of what goes on in this country these days. I only know that, in Brazil (where I lived for 24 years, until 5 years ago) I could get a transmission rebuilt in a comparable Brazilian car in a day and a half for $400-600, whereas here it would cost me around $3000.

A few days after I left, I went to another dealership.  I told the salesperson about my experience at Trophy Nissan.  The sales person told me he used to work at Trophy and that is normal business for them.  They tell customers over the phone a vehicle is available even if the vehilce was sold.  They intentionally keep sold vehicles on their website to lure customers to the lot, even if the vehicles had been sold weeks before.  They also advertise cash cars but when the customer comes in to buy one, the vehicle is no longer available and that the dealership's job is to sell vehicles to finance, not to sell cars for cash.  I also found out something really interesting.  Every phone call into and out of the dealership is recorded.

I recommend that if you have a complaint about their dealership, get an attorney to request the phone calls regarding the vehicle you are interested and to get the sales records to prove when the the vehicle was sold.

They are shady, unprofessional liars and I will never step foot in nor reccommend their ghetto dealership - Trophy Nissan to anyone! It was an absolute HORRIBLE experience!!",1.6
1229,"July 10, 2010","To whom it may concern,
Yesterday I contacted Trophy Nissan of Mesquite’s internet support team and
got a hold nice lady named BJ Peluso. She was very nice and told me the vehicle I was
calling on was sold already (ok, it happens). I had become use to this as I have been
aggressively searching out an Armada for nearly 3 weeks. She then told me they just
got a new one in (used) and it would be in my price range. My price range had been
explained to her as $400 - $450 w/ no money down. She said let me do some more
checking into the vehicles to ensure all is right and she would call me back. Since I live
over 60 miles away from Mesquite (Joshua, Tx), I was please to hear her do this (confirm
it was a go) before I'd drove out. About 30-45 mins later a salesman by the name of
Calvin Perkins called and said he had the 2008 Armada I wanted and asked if I could
come out to see it.
So I got a babysitter ($20.00) and I drove the 1hr and 15 min drive to see him
(mind you the gas prices estimated $20.00). Upon getting there all was good, we went
over our budget once again. We told him we would not be putting any money down and
we wanted to make sure the payments did not exceed $450.00 limit. He then said the
one he called us about then was out of our price range so he wanted to show us another
similar Armanda (red flag). I asked how much the other was and he stated an estimated
31-36k, but price hasn't been set yet. I thought, ok, I can't afford that. He walked across
the street oto get the SUV from the detailing shop. After about 30 mins, he pulled up in
a nice Armada matching what we wanted (black w/ dark interior). We took a test drive
and boy was it nice. He claimed the other was fully loaded, so my wife and I were left
wondering if this SUV wasn't loaded what did a loaded one come with, lol. This model
had power everything, backup camera, sensors, etc... only missing navigation, dvd or
sunroof.
After the test drive we told him we liked it and we went in to work out the
details. After many, many delays he came back and said don't be scared by the price we
can work it out (red flag). He proceeded to show me the quote sheet which was label
31,000+ dollars. I'm not rocket scientist but this isn’t even close to our budget. So he
started chopping all the features we wanted like warranty, DVD, navigation, clean and
detailing (?), etc... and said we would need 5-6k down to get it to around $450.00 a
month. I then proceed to verbally tear him a new (you get the point). This dealership
had wasted nearly 5 hours of my families even, driving cost, and the cost of a babysitter
to come see a vehicle in what I was told was my price range. Told him this was a clear
case of bait and switch and he knowingly took us through the whole ordeal with no

to knowing about the vehicle that BJ Peluso spoke of. He claimed it was in line to be
processed and it wasn’t ready to be viewed. He claimed it would be ready to see maybe
tomorrow. Striking our last nerve my wife and I left mad as hell. You can rest assured I
will NEVER return to Trophy Nissan of Mesquite.
Here is the sad part, Calvin showed us such a nice vehicle I’m not certain
any Armada we look at after this will measure up to it. How can one be shown such
a vehicle such as that and then be expected to settle for so much less afterwards.

The car had less than 2000 miles on it and, per the salesman, had not been wrecked.  What kind of reconditioning does a practically new car need?

1244,"April 19, 2010","I should have listened to my inner voice on this one.  I saw a 2006 Nissan Pathfinder listed on their website and sent an email inquiry.  Maria promptly contacted me, and although she said she was not trying to rush me, made it quite clear that they were a high volume dealership and cars sold quickly.  I told her if she could provide me with a carfax and meet my price requirement, I would make the time to get there.  She gave me the name of Charles Traylor in case she was not available.  I should tell you that Mr. Traylor, emailed me, left a voicemail, and texted me to make sure I was coming in (seriously, a misspelled text).

I explained to her that my time was limited and I was concerned with driving from Frisco to Mesquite for nothing.  She assured me she and her managers would do everything in their power to respect my time, work with my budget needs, and she even offered to waive teh $2100 certification fee. (Ask other Nissan dealerships, most of them will waive it or charge next to nothing..$2100 is a ripoff).  On Friday evening I had an instant chat with Maria to make sure the car was still there.  Again, I was assured it was still there, and to get to the dealership as soon as possible.

I got to the dealership and was met by a salesman and a trainee, who were quite nice, they explained that Maria worked in the business office and did not sell cars..  They ushered me into a tiny cubicle (there were tons of cubicles).  I showed them which car I was looking at, and our salesman left to go check on it.  Naturally, some time later, he returned to say the car had sold late the previous night (they close at 10pm.  

It was then explained there were only 2 cars that had anything remotely close to the car which I had come to see.  One was just an awful car, the other not so bad but with more miles.  After my husband and I declined yet another person came out to try to ""help"" us.

It is now Monday afternoon, and the vehicle that was supposedly sold is still listed on their website, at a slightly higher price (as well as another car I had asked about that was supposedly not there anymore).

Everyone was polite and nice, but I lost nearly 2 hours there from our salesman supposedly running around looking for cars.  This, of course after I stressed the importance of time.

Trust me when I say they will hit you with a bunch of random fees, and not to trust the website prices.  This dealership is a turn and burn, bait and switch operation.  Their BBB rating is F, which I should have checked ahead of time.  Save yourself the stress.

1245,"April 10, 2010","DO NOT GO HERE!!! FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!! FALSE PRICES!!! AND THEY WILL DECIDE WHAT VEHICLE THEY WANT YOU TO BUY!! THEY DON'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!! We found a 2007 Nissan Murano we liked on their website. It had the right miles (35,578) and the right price ($16,986). My husband call and talked to the receptionist on Monday, April 5, 2010 to get more information and to set up a time to test drive it later on the week. We didn't get any information from her and she said she would have a salesman contact us to set an appointment. Well, the salesman didn't call till Wednesday, April 7 just to write down all the information we gave to the receptionist and he said he would call back that afternoon to set up a time for us to test drive the car. Well, that never happened. I checked their website several times throughout each day to make sure the car was there before we drove the 3 hours there. My husband even called before we left to make sure they had the car. They said they did, so we headed up there Friday April 9. Once we got there, we saw that they didn't have all these pre-owned Nissan Muranos that they advertise on their website (their website shows 43). A salesman immediately took us inside to get our information and start a deal before we even saw any vehicle. We told him we wanted to look first before anything because we were going to be paying in cash plus the trade in value of our 2002 Nissan Altima. We never told him how much cash we were willing to pay. Then he walks out and goes and talks a manager. A hour later, the salesman runs outside to bring a car to the front for us to look at. He takes my husband immediately to the back seat first instead of letting him looking at the mileage. So I looked. It was a 2004 Nissan Murano with 90,000 miles on it. We immediately said NO THATS NOT WHAT WE WANT, IT HAS WAY TOO MANY MILES. But his manager decided that it was what he thought we should buy and that's why he brought it around. We never talked to this manager at all. So the salesman went back inside to let the manager know that we didn't want that Murano. While he was doing that, we went and looked at their other pre-owned Muranos. They only had 2 (their website showed 43). Both were 2009 with less than 30,000 miles. The salesman came back out and tried to talk us into buying one of them. We said only if they increase the price of our trade in and drop the price of the Murano down. Well, he didn't like that. So we went on a ""tour"" of the dealership looking for other Muranos. When we didn't find any other Muranos, the salesman tried to get us to buy a different vehicle. We said NO, WE WANT A NISSAN MURANO. He takes us back inside to see if they had any other Muranos plus try to talk us into buying a different vehicle. We kept said NO but he didn't like that response to his offers. So he went and got that manger. The manager treated us like we were dumb. We found out at that point the 2007 Nissan Murano we saw on their website had been sold early that week. We asked why did they not remove it from their website. They said they didn't have the resources or time to update their website. They didn't know this but my husband used to be a salesman for a car dealership back home. So when my husband started talking with the manager, my husband pointed out everything including their false advertisement. The manager said it wasn't false advertisement. But it was. They didn't have the 43 pre-owned Nissan Muranos and the price online is about $5,000 lower than what it actually is. They can say it because of certification but it doesn't cost that much. At that point the manager started getting really rude with us. He started offering us other vehicles. We said NO. Then he offers us a truck. Again we said NO because we're trying to start a family and thinking about our future needs in a vehicle. After that NO he started insulting us and called us names. At that point, knowing we were going to agree on anything, we got up said we'll take our money else where the people aren't rude and walked out with the salesman and manager following us all the way to our car with the manager harassing and insulting us the whole way. My husband tried as much as possible to keep his cool. I went straight to our car and started it up while he had some last words with the manager. About 45 minutes later, one of the managers from dealership called us to make an appointment for the following day, Saturday, April 10. My husband told him he had already been there today, will not ever return, he was pissed off with a manger insulting us and that they were the worse dealership he's ever dealt with and hung up.

1246,"March 31, 2010","If you want the most HIDEOUS experience possible buying a car, then Trphy Nissan is for you! Right out of the 1970's, unbelievable. We drove from Euless with an internet print out of a car in stock  to buy a car. We were told it was in stock, we called 2 minutes before we landed at the dealer. We were rushed in to an office by a young guy who seemed very nice and we sat down. We asked to see the car. He proceeded to take our information ( name, address, number etc) O.K. no problem. We just turned in a lease car and we are preapproved with our credit union. Great credit, money down, solid citizens. He asked to fill out a credit app and get pre-approved. DO NOT DO THIS, every credit inquiry on your bureau lowers your credit score and it looks bad when you are ready to buy ( why has he gone to so many dealers?) He asked us what payment we wanted, how much money down, were we ready to buy today. We asked him, Can we see the car? He did not listen to anything we said, just continued with his spiel. I think they are programmed to follow a set script. We refused to answer anymore questions until we saw the car. He got the manager who started questions about, what payment do we want? We asked CAN WE SEE THE CAR?  He said we should do the credit because ""we don't want to waste your time or ours"" 3 things for aspiring car salesman. If a customer drives 30 miles with a printout from the internet, they are buyers. If a customer has turned in a lease car, they probably have decent credit. If a customer says that he is preapproved from their credit union, they are probably buyers. We asked the sales manager, can we see the car. He didn't listen to us and continued talking in car salesman lingo. We got up and left with 5 or 6 following us. WE NEVER SAW THE CAR OR WERE OFFERED TO SEE ANY CARS. Don't waste their time or yours.

Even though I bought my car at blue book value 2 years ago, my wife and I went to Trophy Nissan with a trade in that had a lot of overhead (to the tune of about $5K). Because of this, I was very nervous about getting a good deal on a trade in. I was also leery of condescending salesman. From the time we arrived, the staff was polite and treated with respect. Specifically, J.W. Regan was helpful in taking us for a test drive, making sure we were very comfortable. We were privileged to negotiate with Brent Wiggins. Brent did a great job of getting us into a car that fit our situation and finances. We did not feel any pressure to make a ""deal"" work for us. Candice Yarbarough did a great job in helping us with our final paperwork and financing as well. We drove away in a vehicle that had only 14 miles on it, our overhead financed on top of the sale price, and an extensive 7 year/100K mile warranty, and financed it all.  Again, I am not sure of why there is such a disparity between my experience and the others, but they must have made some major changes in service at the dealership.

Im so confused because I couldnt believe all the lies this guy was saying just to sell a damn car. We go back inside and I didnt even get a proper inspection of the vehicle bc Sabre kept being extremely pushy and was even quoting The Bible. I didnt go for a church service I wanted to talk about the damn car. EVERY time I asked a serious question about the car, he would change the subject and start telling his life stories. He was the perfect example of a shady sheisty crooked car salesmen. I am still furious about this. Then we signed papers for the car almost unwillingly which was dumb on my part. The next day we go to pick the car up, we find out that it is a lemon! GREAT so I get my old car back and leave home happy....GOD ANSWERS PRAYERS I really couldnt afford a 400 car payment right now anywayss STAY AWAY FROM TROPHY NISSAN PLEASE",1.0
1265,"June 30, 2009","I recently  went to Trophy to buy another vehicle after I was involved in a total loss as a result of an ice storm. I did not qualify for a loan through trophy so the sales person Alex Pezeshki begins to try and talk me into getting a family member to co-sign the loan. I informed him that I was unable to unless I asked first. He disregarded this statement because he began to run my mothers credit. My mother had more than 15 inquiries on her credit because of Trophy Nissan and the actions of Alex Pezeshki. I immediately contacted Trophy Nissan and told them about this and no one seemed to care. They actually tried to talk me into still doing business with them, it was almost comedic. My mother currently has a pending case with the Attorney Generals office regarding this matter. Trophy has never apologized or shown any accountabilities for their actions. They initially refused to give me back the money I had put down for the vehicle and I had to contact an attorney just to get that back. When I went in to pick it up my check after an entire month they were very rude and acted like they could care less. The Sales people had prison tattoos and looked like it was their first job out. On one occasion when I called to speak with a manager, they refused to put the manager on the phone and Alex Pexeshki(Sales Person) begins to act like he's the manager claiming to be Jerry Smith. Everyone in my office was laughing hystarically. So I go up to the dealership and I speak with Jerry and asked him if he was the person I spoke with the day before and he says ""no,"" I tell him what happened and then he says I'm sorry I will take care of it and begins to act like he is calling Alex and telling him off. Please realize, all of this happened to me, and all I was trying to do was give this dealership an opporutnity to earn my business. WARNING!!!! They will run credit without authorization. This does affect your credit score, they did this to my family and we still don't know how they obtained their personal information.

1266,"April 24, 2009","I had 2 issues with my vehicle, one with the MPG gauge inside and another with a rattleing noise. When trophy found out that the MPG gauge was defective (after I brought it in twice) they said there would replace it. So they ordered the part and gave me a rental- came back to the dealership the next day to pick up car and what do you now the service technician forgot to seat the entire plastic and glass for the odometer into place causing a 1/2 inch gap, so then I had to wait another 30 min for them to fix the problem, finally they fixed it and I went home. About 4000 miles after that incident I had a problem with rattling noises coming from inside the cabin, so I took it to Trophy and did a test drive w/ one of the tech's he said he thinks the sound is coming from the steering column/Pillar A. So I dropped it off and waited approx. 6hrs. Then they called back and told me to pick it up. I come back to the dealership sign some papers stating I don’t owe anything and Trophy says they need to order a part and it will come in next week, I say ok and before I get into my car I look down at the floor mat and find a screw and a clip and I figure the dam tech's forgot to put everything back together and then I look closer at the steering column and find a crack in the left side top bezel where the pieces are joined together. I go back in and see the manager and explain to him my problem, He comes outside and tells me the tech forgot to put the screws into place, and I show him the crack, we then find out not only is the steering column plastic cracked on one side due to over-tightening both sides are loose and the clips are broken. Manager apologizes and tells me he'll order a new top bezel for steering column and tells me he'll put it in next time I come in for the other part because they have to order the part. I say ok and I leave the dealership and drive 1/4 of a mile and find out the top plastic part of the odometer isn't seated right. I try to fix it myself thinking it was just some popped out clip to no avail, I bring it back to Trophy and talk to the manager about the new problem he come outside and brings my car directly to the service center and tells them to repair it and tells me it will be about 15 min. The tech then fixes the problem in a mediocre manner and leave the top part of the dash still not flush with vinyl and I tell the manager what I see and he ashure's me that he’s very sorry for the inconvenience and that he's ""going to get onto that technician"" and tells me he will fix the problem to satisfaction next time I come in for my repairs next week I agree and go home. I’m writing this complaint because of improperly trained carless service tech's and because of the amount of time I spent finding these problems out for myself, and the insane number of time's I have been to Nissan fixing problems for a new car that under 8,100 miles. Seriously this has got to be the worst Nissan dealership in the USA, I wouldn’t even trust these guys on an oil change because I'd be afraid one of their retarded techs would forget some crucial component... DO NOT Do BUSSINESS HERE!!!",1.0
1267,"September 24, 2008","started with internet quote on specific vehicle - long story short, car is not there and price is nowhere near what they offered through email - obvious bait and switch - beware of extra dealer adds and costs - i then went to a smaller dealership (thornhill) and was treated very well not to mention correct quotes and vehicle.",2.0
1268,"September 20, 2008","All the advertisement on TV or online are phony just to lure people to go. The slaesman never honored what been originally promised.
The wheel on the vehicle were not original as decribed on the sticker.
It was just a waste my time 4 hours drviving 70 miles to check it out.

1269,"August 16, 2008","My complaint is on similar terms.  After negotiating with Trophy and another dealership for a car where another dealership offered a better price, one of the sales managers (Tim) convinced me over the phone to come to Trophy as he would ""beat any dealer by $250.""  

When I arrived at the dealership the next day as planned, turns out the car that we had an agreement on.... had been sold--BEFORE Tim (or Timothy) had lured me to the dealership this deception.

We made a trip out to trophy nissan believing we had a deal on a certain car for a certain price...and the managers knew they didn't even have the car they were selling!  Even more, when we arrived at Trophy ( I was told by manager Timothy to find him when i got there), he wouldn't meet with me as he was 'too busy.'

If you want to be treated with honesty and respect, do not go to Trophy Nissan!",1.0
1270,"June 04, 2008","We were left in their madhouse of a showroom while the salesman searched for his keys. As he lead us out the door he exited first and didn't hold the door for my wife. He must of been 30 paces in front of us on the way to show us a new car. We happened to walk towards our car, so when we got closer, I told my wife just to get in because we were leaving, this guy was rude. So, as we drove away, we looked back only to see him chasing us in the new car honking!! What a jerk!",1.0
1271,"March 16, 2008",We were lied to about the prices and about several other facts in the purchase of the car.  When my husband and I tried to stop the sale all together instead of allowing us to just cancel the deal they attacked us verbally about how much time they had taken to seal the deal.  We felt pressured into signing the papers.,1.2
1272,"October 12, 2007","I bought 2 vehicles from trophy.  I purchased a 1995 240SX new in 1994 and a 1996 truck new in 1996.  I had recurring problems with both vehicles.  I found the sales people to be extremely pushy and somewhat overbearing.  

My 240SX, while a nice car, had a recurring problem with the air bag sensor.  The first time I took it in for service, it was there a few hours and I was called and told the car was ready.  I picked it up.  About a week later the air bag light came on again.  I took it back for service.  The car was there a few hours and I was called and told the car was ready.  I picked it up.  About a week later, the air bag light came on again.  Angry this time, I drove the car back to Trophy.  On I-30 during rush hour, the thermostat froze shut and the car overheated.  By the time I nursed the car into the dealer, I also had a flat tire.  I went into the service department, explained that this was the third time in a month that the car was here for the same problem and on the service rep's bulletin board, I happened to see 2 other work orders for 1995 240SX's with ""air bag light on"".  Needless to say, I was furious.  I told the service rep not to call me again until the car was fixed.  After a week and having to order a new air bag sensor, the car seemed to be fixed.  

My 1996 truck had a speaker in the radio fail after one year and the truck constantly shuddered and squeaked when the air conditioner compressor would engage.  Trophy claimed they could not recreate that problem, so I traded that truck in as soon as possible.  I will never buy another Nissan.",1.0
1273,"June 17, 2007","I applied online for them & was sent an email the next day telling me to call the Internet Sales person which was Noweda Jamison, well I called she said I will have a sales person call you first thing Monday morning (since we talked on Saturday night)so that you can come down & pick out your new car. I was so excited & looking forward to it. Then comes Monday it's 3pm & no call, so I call her & ask what happened wasn't somebody suppose to call me? She said let me call you right back to check & see why they haven't called you. So I did wait an hour or so. I call back again & ask to talk to a Sales person & he looks for my file & tells me that I was not approved. So what made me mad is that she just gave me the run around intested of just telling me what was going on. This is not the best place to go to so beware, they  are some bad sales people there.",1.0
1274,"January 24, 2007","I went to the delership the sales person was okay, the manager was rude and tried to get me into a deal I couldnt count on. To make a long story short I purchased an Xterra, did all the paper work, left with the car. I got a deal on it, but the problem was they called me 2 days later telling me the bank didnt approve me after they made me go throug 5 hours of my time for nothing. It would have been nice to know before I drove off, that I was not approved. I asked for my downpayment back of course, and that took an hour. The dealership is crapy, the place stinks and there was trash all over the floor. Its bad, I got screwed over, so watch out. I would never recommend such a place to someone  in need of a car. teresa31411@yahoo.com",1.0
1275,"August 01, 2006","I visited the used car division because on TV they advertised their ""Double Down"" sale where you ""buy one get one free."" The advertisement stated that if you purchase ""any car at any price"" you could pick a second car from the ""winner's circle"" absolutely free while supplies lasted. The sale started the same day we purchased a 2004 VW Passat for $22000. When we tried to take advantage of the advertised special, we were given excuses ranging from ""our credit score was not above 700"" to ""our car did not meet the price requirements"". I was a victim of a classic Bait and Switch. Don't make the same mistake. Advoid this dealership at all costs.",1.0
