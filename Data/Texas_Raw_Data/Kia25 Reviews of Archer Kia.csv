When this was brought to his attention, his response was that a third-party company runs their website and must have made a mistake. Over a week later the car is still listed on their site as new.",1.0
1,"July 11, 2019","Brought my Kia Sorento(2018) over to have an oil change and tire rotation. Noticed a week after I left that 2 of my lug nuts were missing.  Took it back out there and the manager stated that I brought it out there like that.  Now these lugs werenâ€™t expensive, I could have easily bought 2 for less that $10 and replaced them but it was the principal of the whole thing.  I brought my car out there with all lugs in tack and thatâ€™s how I expected to pick it up.  Ed the manager was horrible and he has all those certificates on the wall out there for what ??? I asked him what my compensation would be for the time I had to spend coming back out there and his reply was, thatâ€™s your problem....Ed needs a class in customer service and if I should have my car serviced out there again, I will definitely take pictures of my vehicle from all sides because who knows, it could be damaged by them and old Ed will say, thatâ€™s your problem....ðŸ˜–",1.0
2,"May 22, 2019","Bought my brand new 2019 Kia Sorento at Archer. I WAS very excited since they gave me a huge deal. A few weeks later I noticed it would have random moments where it struggled to turn on and making 19 mpg on the HIGHWAY filling up my tank quite often. I took it to Archer where I felt like they thought I did not know how to turn a car on. Days later they called back to say my car was fine. After 8 months of struggling with the same issues my car gave out completely. I chose to have my car taken to Joe Myers Kia 20 miles out from me rather than Archer Kia that is less than 3 miles away since Archer kept giving me the runaround!!! 

Joe Myers Kia informed me I was sold a brand new car with bad battery cells. So bad they had no idea how Archer could have overlooked this and let me drive out the lot with it. I quickly hit 30.4  MPG on the highway leaving Joe Myers with a new battery. Thank you so much Joe Myers for taking my issue seriously. I can only imagine how much MONEY I HAVE WASTED ON GAS for the past 8 MONTHS because of an issue that Archer kept overlooking.",3.2

5,"October 12, 2018","You sad men babies crying to my son about my post and telling him I made threats.Are you guys scared of the owner ? Contacting the owner is not a threat.

Thanks for handing my son the void letter FINALLY.

.

Owner CLEAN HOUSE!

I will remove this post within the same amount of days it took you to hand over the voided letter. Plus a few more days on top.

Attention Don per our conversation 5 minutes ago

1.My son and I do not have a FB so to say you Tagged us is not true and if we had FB and you did who cares ..I placed this review because Ryan was rude,the assistant finance guy was rude and today you were rude. 

2.How did a folder get lost among adults why was this never told to me ?Instead of avoiding my calls and emails from yesterday morning to last night-honesty; the day before - open communication ,integrity, politeness goes a long way.

3.I made no threats. It is my plan to email the owner if I don't have a resolution today.
5 minutes is what is takes to put VOID on a letter to my credit union and state the car was returned. I have a response from your wife the online Director stating someone told her it was done.That was a lie because my bank continues to call me.

4.To tell me ' if we wanted help we should not have posted' WELL. I tried to follow the process IT DID NOT WORK! So I am posting until my bank gets the proper paperwork to unfreeze my funds.

5. To call my son yesterday and not me to ask for my banks email address is sad

6.To say 'now yall need help yall should not have posted - the owners now know and its above the owenrs 'well we tried the proper process but what I experienced was avoidance and rude ppl.For what ? it is not my fault the car was crap had it was not inspected thoroughly before being put up for sale!

5.To tell me You guys did not have to take the car back ..well Don when a car is falling a apart before the 5th day IT IS  THE NOBLE thing to do !

6.I appreciate you taking the ' glued part' ..engine light on ...old xxx radiator fluid ..car back THANK YOU!

7. no one cares my son has 2 jobs and school and my funds are held up 

8.BTW my son is headed there now since you told him today ' I think you should come up here' and my son reply was ' I don't have a car' 
 well he has paid for an uber to come and get a written copy of the letter to say VOID and a Letter to say the car was returned upon Ryan's request as he spoke and got clearance from Todd the other owner a few days ago.

I did nothing wrong but return a car that was litterally falling apart.

As this is the only platform I appear to get movement on I will continue.There are no threats lol you guys just don't like to admit Fault and simply say sorry you screwed up.

What you like to do is blame the customer for posting.Just like you are pissed because of these post.

I have the right to be pissed.

People skills and human kindness can go a long way..

So I need you adults to put your brains together and think of where the magical folder can be so we can all close this chapter.

Enjoy your weekend",1.0
6,"October 08, 2018","This dealership has put me through a lot. It's actually too much to type. I spoke with kia consumer services regarding the many issues with my ""new car"" and the Archer Kia dealership. I thought the things would be fixed and our business-customer relationship would be restored, but this is definitely not the case. When I arrived to the service area of the dealership no one new what was going on or why I was there. I had to wait over an hour just for them to accept what I was saying to them regarding the issues and how I spoke with Kia the previous day. After the hour, they finally started working on getting me a loaner car. I left service department right at two hours later.
      The Archer Kia service department had my car for a week, and didn't call me or respond to my calls about what was going on. Gary called me back, but he insisted that nothing was wrong with my car. He said that a few people had driven the car, and that they could not duplicate any of the complaints. He said, ""the complaints probably happened only on certain roads, but nothing is wrong with this computerized car."" He also said that the they drove my car for only 30 miles to test drive it. I asked if they provide gas for those miles, but he insisted that Kia does not replace fuel. I got to the service department, and found that my car had been driven almost 60 miles, and that everything I had listed as a concern wasn't documented. I do have some fault in the documentation part because I should have read over it very carefully. However, they wouldn't listen and pushed me off on each other when I tried to tell them. I asked to speak with a manager about the gas, complimentary wash or detailing. The guy went in to talk to him, but the manager would not come out. I just heard him say ""tell her we put 5 gallons in the tank."" I cranked my car up, and heard the same noises I complained about, and the guy said it was normal.I left because I didn't want to argue them, and it was also tough to keep my two year old toddler calm. I compared my car's rattling noises to another brand new Kia Optima, and they do not sound the same. I have also recorded the sounds on my phone. I thought that I would be able to speak with the district manager for the dealership, but he never contacted me after my initial complaint.  I feel like I have been cheated since buying the car. I also feel that I am stuck with a vehicle that is not up to standard, but the dealership doesn't want to admit fault. This entire situation has costed me a lot of wasted time, money, and mental exhaustion. I am now even having to deal with constant calls from my previous lender because they have not received any correspondence from Archer Kia about the pay off for my car. They are saying that I owe them money.  Please do not come to this dealership. Apparently, they will all cover for each other, so nothing will get done properly.",1.2

8,"October 02, 2017","I just left a review on a survey I received via email. In short: completely satisfied. Sean was helpful and knowledgeable. He listened and explained, simply, the feature of the car and the warranties. The transition through buying phase was great. All employees that I came I contact with were very friendly and helpful. Great experience ",5.0
9,"September 21, 2017","First off let me say I purchased a 2018 Kia Sorento here on 9-12-17, I am in no way unhappy with the car I purchased but the dealer experience here pretty much sucked. Here is my story ..
I lost my primary source of transportation and my home in Hurricane Harvey so I was in the market for a new vehicle, I had driven my Mom's Kia Sorento and I liked it very much so that's what I wanted to buy... The salesman liked to talk , A LOT but wasn't really keen on listening, I explained to him that I had lost my car and needed another, I further explained that I was counting on him heavily to get me the best deal possible because my mind was not in the best place due to the stress of loosing everything, he assures me I'm going to get the best possible deal... So he explains that there are 3 trim levels and I tell him I want the middle trim level, test drove exactly 1 midlevel Sorento , already knew I liked it so I told him I'd take it... What he didn;t notice is that I took notice of the sticker price on the window so i knew what the sticker price was, still hoping this guy is going to get me a deal ... You can imagine my surprise when he brings me papers to sign that show a price WAY over the sticker price, I asked ""did I not see a much lower price on the window?"" So we go outside and sure enough there is the way lower price , he assures me he just put in the wrong stock number, I'm thinking to myself we only looked at the one car and I saw him write down the information off THAT car !!  So he apologizes and once again assures me I'm going to get the best possible deal, once again the paper work comes to me to sign and you know what that BEST POSSIBLE DEAL was ? The freaking sticker price , I mean seriously don't do me any favors here... I think the deal here was he was expecting me to reject the first numbers so he could bring me the sticker price and present it as this great deal, infuriating !!  So I paid full price for my car basically, not a DEAL in any form ! Ok so we get all that out of the way and I'm waiting on the car to be washed and detailed, the car wasn't ever actually dirty per say but it was far from detailed and guess what I waited all that time and it was obvious the vehicle had not been cleaned in any way... .I left the dealership in fortunately a really awesome vehicle that I paid full price for and wasn't even detailed , I felt taken advantage of , I won't be going back , ever !",1.8
10,"April 28, 2017","We were met by Dylan when we walked into the showroom.  He was very helpful, listened to what we were looking for in a car and presented us with the options available. No pressure, no hype. I will definitely be back when I am in the market again.  ",5.0
11,"April 22, 2017","I had a great experience buying my 2017 Kia Soul last week! Dylan was knowledgeable and very patient with me as I was indecisive on what I wanted! He even came in on his day off when I finally made a decision, which I ended up changing once again! Still, he was patient and happy to help! I love my new Kia Soul and I'd recommend Dylan to friends! ",4.8

13,"December 29, 2016","Archer kia has had my vehicle in there possession at the collision center for 2 months and 4 days when I was told the vehicle was read to be picked up. The collected over7000 dollars from me and my insurance company and i got 12 miles down the road and my car overheated on me. I am really upset wih the qualityof workmanship from Archer Kia. airbag sensor hanging under the hood, airbag light on dash lit up, anotherÂ  warning light on dash lit up. spare parts left in car, ac no longer working which worked great before they worked on it. Coolent all over engine, back bumper with visable damaged not fixed. driver side window dose not work properly going up and down and rattles in the door panel when you open or close driver side door AND a hole in the radiator i was told was replaced. Also installed aÂ  USED engine in my vehicle that has no cover on it. wiring harness not properly installed with proper clips that are visibly there just not attached. i will be making my 3rd car payment to kia in aa few days for aÂ  car i have not had in two in a half months. Mark also let me and my son leave in car that had a FAKE EXPIRED TAG & NO REGISTRATION. He should have been proactive and made sure my vehicle was completely safe for My son and I to use for traveling to our Christmas plans but as he told me ""he only drove it around the block"". $7000+ and 2 months and 4 days latter and I am still waiting for Archer Kia to make this right.Â  I would appreciate if Arcer Kia owner or dealership management contact me directly at chardstarr@gmail.com AsAp!!",1.0
14,"April 12, 2016","Totally, I have 6 Kia vehicles in my life and bought three cars from Archer Kia. Never had any problem with any other dealerships but having a horrible experiences with Archer Kia.

1. Didn't know what happened after the service, the Bluetooth system of my first car was cut on and off but the service dept blamed on me because I had 3 different types of phones from 2 different service providers so that's why causing the problems. Finally, asked Kia headquarter to get involve and spent almost 8 months back and forth for the replacement to solved the problem.
2. When I took my second car to Joe Myer Kia for the second oil change, Joe Myer stated the technician of Archer Kia was over tighten the drain plug and rotated itself, needed to replace the oil pan instead.
3. When I took my third vehicle back to Archer for the first oil change and tire rotation today but the service manager stated the technician was damaged the right side mirror, passenger-side front door and back door when drove in to the shop.

I just can't believe what happened to all my vehicles at Archer Kia, and I would never ever take my vehicles back to this dealer forever.",2.2
15,"September 10, 2015",Called on the phone to see if they would match another dealers price since Archer is closer to where I live. Of coarse they said they would until I got there. Then they tried to give me every excuse why they couldn't match another dealers price! They even swore to me the other dealer wouldn't sell it for the advertised price! Well guess what they lied because the other dealer sold it to me for the Internet price without a hassle. Shop online all the kia dealers before buying! It will save you thousands of dollars! ,1.0
16,"June 12, 2015","I now have my third Kia from Archer. I do my homework and shop around, but no one beats Archer's price or way of doing business. New car manager Ryan and owner Todd are both straight shooters. They will patiently answer questions and work with you until you're satisfied with the deal on the car you want. Go ahead and compare other dealers, then take aim for Archer Kia. You'll be glad you did. ",5.0
17,"December 30, 2014","We went looking at a 2012 Toyota Sienna we saw online.  We called ahead and asked if it was available to test drive.  Geoff Alldred checked that it was still available while we were on the phone with him.  We he assured us that the car was there, we drove over.  Geoff immediately went to get the car when we arrived and gave us all the information we needed regarding the car.  

After seeing the car, we realized that the car would not suit our needs, but Geoff was courteous throughout our dealings with him ",5.0
18,"October 16, 2014","We were very disappointed with the process.  The salesman (G.) was not friendly and barely said a word... actually, that wasn't that bad.  We are still awaiting the extra key we negotiated for.  We also witnessed them jump the battery to get it started before we drove off with it.  So yes, they sold us a car with a failing battery.  Had to replace the battery within days of purchase.  We'd already signed everything - but it's still bull.",1.0
19,"September 28, 2012",customer service after the sale is horrible. You are just a number to them after you sign on the dotted line. Also beware of them trying to get you to sign a service contract.,2.0
20,"March 21, 2012","My new car experience was going sour real fast, but the team here stepped up to the plate and worked to turn it around, they did, I walked out a happy customer and would highly recommend this dealership to anyone and everyone.  This is a top notch team.  Joseph, Todd, Ryan and Richard, thanks so much.  This kind of customer service has earned them a loyal customer.  PS  Love, love my Kia.",5.0
21,"February 16, 2012","Sales Manager was a demading, dishonest, verbally abusive bully who made the new car purchasing experience painful when trying to increase our previously negotiated price. He shouted ""don't cop an attitude"" while he was trying to cheat us. I feel more like a crime victim than a customer. A few days later the experience still hurts. ",1.5
22,"July 15, 2011",Really good experience. Only complaint is we had to wait 20 minutes to get into the finance office but I have never bought a car that I didn't have to wait so that was typical. We did a lot of research on the Sorento before making our purchase and we are quite pleased with the car. This is our first Kia.,4.8
23,"June 13, 2011","I'm only giving this one star because that is the lowest this website has. We recently bought a Kia from Archer. They told us a price for the car and then while we were financing it, told us another price, that was higher than what they told us. The salespeople were friendly, but the actual manager and higher-ups had no etiquette. The majority of the salespeople had no manners either. At any point in the day you could see at least 2-3 of them outside in the car lot smoking in front of the all the people. 

This is hands down the worst dealership you can go to to buy a car. The manager was extremely rude. To him, it was nothing but a business. After seeing the increase in price, I objected and he told me and I quote, ""Look, you wanna buy this or not? If you want to then great, but if not, I'll see you later"". You could almost smell the lack of etiquette and intelligence in these people. 

If you want to get a car/Kia, You do not need to go to this dealership. Not only will you regret losing your money here, you won't get treated well. Go to Carmax/Texas Direct Auto, or another dealership; but not Archer Kia. 

Please take my advice. ",1.0
24,"April 13, 2011",I have never been to a dealership like this. I was looking for a used car and I noticed they had some low mile/low price cars. I went to look at them and every single car was so filthy inside and either smelled like smoke or urine. I would not recommend this dealer. ,2.6
