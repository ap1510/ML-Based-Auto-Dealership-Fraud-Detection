Tony Mccloud was amazing and worked out a great deal for us. He was very kind, understanding, and knowledgable. He went above and beyond when other dealerships acted like they barely cared. ",5.0

He had our first choice car ready to go but had also gone the extra mile to have two other similar options ready for us to look at.  JB was honest, more than fair and considerate of our every need.

26,"May 11, 2020","I visited a couple of dealerships before coming here. They essentialy wasted my time. I found a Yukon XL online at Huffine's and inquired about it. Tony gave us a shout within minutes and told us he'd wait for us. When we arrived to the dealership he had the car right out front waiting. He made the whole experience very easy and simple for us. He respected that we had financing already in place and didn't pressure us to run our credit for a better rate. I immediately fell in love with the Yukon during our test drive and after coming to an agreement on the vehicle and an extremely fair trade in price, we drove it home. They had it detailed and put gas in it while we were signing the paperwork. We were in and out in less than an hour. This is the type of service that turns casual shoppers into loyal customers. I'll definitely be back to purchase another vehicle from Tony. ",5.0

34,"March 23, 2020","While traveling through Lewisville in my Chevrolet pickup pulling a car trailer, the engine began cycling between overheating and cooling. Initially, I suspected a faulty gauge, but finally decided it must be a faulty thermostat that was opening and closing. I finally exited the highway and opened the hood to find an engine that was spewing steam and smoke. Since it was late in the afternoon and Huffines Chevrolet was 5 minutes away and I assumed they had space to store my trailer, I chose to take the truck there for inspection and repair. 

They called 3 days later with their assessment. According to their bid, the truck needed a new water pump ($349.20), new thermostat ($28.02), new temperature sensor ($74.88), new clutch fan ($259.32), coolant service ($149.95), 8 hours of labor at $150/hr ($1,200.96), and tax and shop supplies for a total of $2,182.26. I immediately became suspicious, so I called the auto repair shop I normally use, Pursur Auto Repair in Denton, to get a bid. Their bid for the exact same parts and labor was $516 plus a $125 wrecker fee. 

Pursur picked up the truck around noon the following day after I paid $105 to Huffines for an inspection fee. Around 4 PM, Pursur Automotive called to say the truck was repaired. And the problem? A faulty $10 thermostat. That‚Äôs all. No need for a new water pump, a new temperature sensor (which the service advisor said was melted), a new clutch fan, or 8 hours of labor. Pursur‚Äôs repair and inspection included pressure testing to make sure there were no head cracks or other damages resulting from the overheated engine, flushing the cooling system, and adding new coolant. The cost to drive away was $164.83 plus a $125 wrecker fee. I‚Äôve driven the truck over 100 miles since then and experienced no mechanical issues. 

I should add that Nik Baker, the Huffines service advisor, called 30 minutes after I told him that Pursur would be coming to get the truck and he offered to lower their bid to $1,300 (or something close). I don‚Äôt remember the exact offer he made because I wasn‚Äôt interested in conducting business with his organization at that point. 

I should also add that I shared the facts of the event with Alan Moore, the Huffines Service Manager, and asked for a refund of the $105 inspection fee and reimbursement for the $125 wrecker fee paid to Pursur Auto. To his credit, he authorized a check for $230. I agreed to take the truck to the dealership so he could inspect it and to pick up the check at the same time. Prior to going to the dealership, he had quizzed his mechanics about their assessment of damages. During their initial inspection, the mechanics apparently replaced the heat sensor module, but didn‚Äôt make note of doing so. Upon inspection, Alan noted that the heat sensor appeared to be new, so the claim that the heat sensor was melted may have been accurate. 

I prefer not to make subjective observations in a public forum, but I can‚Äôt spin this experience in any way that makes Huffines look good.

39,"April 30, 2019","When we shopped around to buy a new car, Huffines said they would give us $9,000 for our trade.  But then we actually sat down for the deal, all of a sudden it was $7,500.  When questioned, we were told that the trade in quote included some rebates.

44,"April 05, 2019","I just purchased a 2019 Chevrolet Volt with the help of Kyle Forga from Huffines Chevrolet in Lewisville. Believe me folks, I purchase a lot of cars and this was my tenth car purchase in the last 5.5 years. Car buying is not fun to me but I loved cars. I hate going to dealerships and all the beat downs so I prefer to do my vehicle shopping over the internet. Normally after I email a dealership, I find almost 100% of the sales or internet sales reps will reply back with a generic email response stating the vehicle is still available and when do you want to come in and test drive the car, never answering my initial question(s). There are no personal touches in doing business that way and my question(s) are never answered. This was not the case with Kyle Forga. Kyle was quick to respond and answer all of my questions fully and my follow up questions only inviting me to the dealership after he felt I was comfortable stopping by to get a vehicle presentation and test drive of the new Volt. 

I also found Kyle to be a very pleasant and thoughtful person by arriving to work early the next day to make sure my new Volt was fully charged and clean for me to pick up that next evening. 

Kyle was also both extremely knowledgeable and helpful throughout the entire process all the way thru financing. During the demonstration process it was found a part was missing from the new Volt. Kyle immediately had the replacement part ordered and followed up making sure to call me as soon as the part arrived. Kyle turned this whole process into a no-hassle transaction for me. 

I was a Police Officer for over 28 years and during the purchase I discovered Kyle is a veteran of our armed service and served with bravely & courage and was injured during his service. I can not think of a more deserving or better person to give my business to! If you are in the market for a new or used vehicle, I would strongly suggest you call and ask for Kyle Forga to get the best deal and to be treated like a King and with the respect you deserve and appreciate.

73,"January 14, 2019","I found the vehicle that I wanted on AutoTrader; however, when I called about the vehicle, Mr. Dawson delayed many calls and emails to me when I was waiting on information to decide on the purchase.  One good thing he did, however, was that he allow my daughter to stop by and test drive the vehicle for me.  When discussing the trade-in of our vehicle, things went a little sour.  They are not willing to give a little on the trade.  My vehicle was in top shape, we were the only owners and it didn't seem to matter.  On top of the trade-in, they were not willing to budge on the buying price of the vehicle we were purchasing.  We ended up making the purchase, but only because we didn't want to go through it again.  If I had it to do over again, I would have sold my vehicle on my own for a higher price and used a different salesman.  Mr. Dawson is a great guy but the comments were uncalled for.  ""I'm not going to lie to you..."", ""I don't care if you buy the vehicle or not..."", things like that.  He didn't really try to help on the price much, didn't cover the options on the vehicle with us and didn't go out of his way to make sure we were taken care of.  It was very late when everything was finished on the financing, so we didn't have much time to go over the vehicle.  We were sent home on 1/3 tank of gas with our very expensive purchase.

In this experience, Mr. Tanner was the one that made us feel better about the sale.  He was the most professional and stayed late to process the financing.  He was willing, no matter how late it was, to explain any questions that we had.  He was great!",2.3

It also stopped while trying to get into my garage.  What frustration!!  The day the car was purchased, the salesman grabbed my phone and was going to pair it.  It did not work.  He said he would fix it the next day.  Another bad experience.  Bottom line, he was not there and did not tell the manager about it!!  After some research, I learned the Samsung S7 would not work.  I spoke to the salesman, he was going to get back to me.  DID NOT HAPPEN.  This whole thing was one story after another with no follow through.  In May, I finally had enough.  My car was traded in for another make and model.  A car I love!  I told the manager and salesman about the trade.  We kept getting emails from Huffines,  I called and told them I no longer had the car so stop emails.  Then my husband called and told them the same thing.

Our salesman, Scott Spiegel, was very easy-going which calmed by paranoid feeling toward buying a car. He asked what we were looking for, gave us a test ride and thoroughly explained the features...to the point where I didn't think I would be able to remember everything. Once we settled on the car, the haggling was minimal. I offered what I believed to be a fair price based on research, we went back-n-forth a couple of times and settled on a number that Edmunds had rated as very fair. Scott then sent us over to Gary for the paperwork. I do not like the car buying process! However, when the next time rolls around for me to purchase, I will definitely look to Huffines

172,"January 25, 2018","So I hate leaving a bad review under someone who didn't directly cause my problem, however since the employee who was responsible, Alex Alfaro, isn't listed on this site I feel it's appropriate for me to leave this review under the manager since this is under his watch ultimately. 

So I had a 4:15 appointment with Craig Martin to test drive a 2017 Malibu. I was already pre-approved through Capital One, and came into the used sales office with my finance papers in hand, ready to test drive and buy. As I come in, Alex greets me at the door and I let him know I have a 4:15 appointment with Craig. Alex let me know that Craig was with a customer, but would let him know I was there and then walked off. I then proceed to wait for an hour and a half with no acknowledgement from any of the other sales staff, most of whom were sitting around and watching videos on Youtube (as I could hear the annoying screams and laughter from the videos and see the reflections on the windows) outside from Greg who offered me a bottle of water. To add to my frustration, Alex actually came back into the office about 1 hour into my wait, makes eye contact, sees that I am still waiting, and then proceeds to leave again without saying anything to anyone or offering to help me. 

Eventually Craig steps away from his customers to ask if I'm waiting for anything, at which point I tell him that I was there for our 4:15 appointment. He then frantically apologies, gets me over to Greg, and then everything proceeds normally for a car purchase. In regards to the actual sales experience, it was okay. To be honest, my view of the actual sales process is pretty tainted due to my frustration.
Ultimately, the only reason I stayed was because I really wanted that car, and knew it would likely be a fast seller.

We looked at about 6 trucks mainly because of the price range that I wanted with the few must-haves, it kind of changed a few things as we went.  After my truck was located, we went to the warm office and started the boring paperwork part of things.  I was never left alone for more than a few min with the back and forth of the negotiation process.

279,"February 26, 2017","Service is great at Huffines  I also dealt with Michael Lewis in collision. The damage was fixed to my satisfaction and in a timely matter. The one great thing was the use of a loaner car while we were getting our collision work done as well as the problems we were having at service.

Don't get me wrong, Michael, Brain O'Connor in service and later Allen Moore, went above and beyond in helping me. Include Pete Krygsman in that and the Sales Manager. Had I realized earlier the problem with my car was going to be so costly I would have probably done things differently.

Cars being what they are, don't always agree with your pocket book. When I finally talked with Allen Moore he was able to help me get into a newer car that was cost effective. I wasn't expecting to walk out with a car payment, but we got a car that is definitely more reliable, with fewer miles and a great extended warranty at what I would consider a fair price. 

All things considered, I think things worked out quite well.

310,"October 20, 2016","Warning!!!! Stay away from this dealership unless you're trying to make a deal with the Devil (Matt Deanda). This guy is the biggest liar I've ever crossed paths with. I had the worst car buying experience with this dealership. So first I'll start off by saying that my original salesperson was very knowledgeable about the car I wanted and he did his best to get me in that car but of course when you're working for the devil (Matt Deanda), you can only do so much. Once I picked out the car I wanted I informed my salesman of my price range. This was at the end of September and they could not meet my offer but they said they would be able to work with me if I waited til October. I waited and they called me saying they had my car ready with the price I was asking but when i came to the dealership they said they were able to get the price a little lower but it still wasn't in my price range. As I was talking to my salesman next to the car outside, Matt Deanda (The Strore Manager) came up with a plot to try to entice me to buy the car by sending one of the members of the sales team to come out and say ""Hey someone is interested in buying the car right now"". He gets the keys from us, drives and picks up another member of the sales team in the parking lot and comes back to where we are and the ""Customer/Salesman"" says ""Yes this is the car I want, lets start the finance"". I guess he didn't know I was observant enough and thought he could get a reaction out of me but the devils tactic didn't work. I left without the car of course then a few days later Matt Deanda himself called me and said that he really wanted to sale the car to me and that he would make me a great deal and to come speak with him on Saturday. Saturday comes and we agree on the price but he tells me I have to wait until the 18th of October so they can mark the car with a bonus tag and I told him that I was willing to wait. Before I leave I ask him  did he need anything from me and he say's no. I then ask him did we need to sign anything to reserve the car and he replies ""No, we're good, I'm a man of my word and I keep my promises"". We shake hands then I left. The next Saturday comes and I call Matt to let him know that I'd like to do an inspection on the vehicle before I pick it up on Tuesday and he says yes that will be fine. I did the inspection with my salesman and everything turned out ok. Now Monday morning roles around and they call me and tell me they sold my car. I went in on my lunch break and confronted the devil (Matt Deanda) and ask him whats going on. He said he didn't know anything about it because he was gone at 6 on saturday and a car salesman sold it. But then he says the car is still on the lot but they were waiting on the guy to get his finance together. I then of course ask him what happened to our deal. I informed him that I had already returned the car I was using because I knew I was getting my new car on Tuesday. He then goes on his lying spree and says ""Oh I am upset, you should have seen the way I was throwing things around here"". I ask him well aren't you the store manager? Don't you have the authority to say what car belongs to who and he replied yes but didn't do anything about it but continued to lie and say that he's going to do what he can to make it up to me while the car is still sitting on the lot. He never called or followed up with me but of course I had no intentions on doing business with this scum anyway.",1.0

I was able to get everything completed in 90 mins and even got introduced to the general manager.

I was very impressed with their pricing and how competitive they are with trade in prices. Their finance department is awesome and explains everything in a way that you walk out feeling you actually remember everything and don't have any buyers remorse over the loan information.

381,"February 06, 2016","As a first time buyer I was pretty nervous about purchasing a car. Upon my arrival to Huffines Chevrolet I was greeted by the office manager who then introduced me to salesman Oscar Gonzalez. 

The car that I was initially interested in had already been sold but Oscar quickly found something that was comparable. After test driving and reviewing the features I decided that I wanted to look at something a bit bigger. Oscar remained patient and was able to find a bigger car (midsize) with all of the things/features that I was looking for. He also worked earnestly to negotiate a deal that I would be comfortable with.

I also had a great experience with the financing (Eric Tanner) team as well. They answered all of my concerns/questions and worked hard to find the best financing deal. 

My total time spent at Huffines (initial arrival to driving off the lot) = approx. 3 hours

Great service and an exceptionable experience for a first time buyer!!",5.0

383,"January 30, 2016","

Well this all started a week before thanksgiving 2015 it now almost February.I emailed the dealership interested in a certain color certain engine and so on. Scott Speigle emailed me back with a picture and details on a truck .I was interested so we set a appt for 9 am the next day. When I arrived at the dealership Scott located the truck and told me another salesman had been driving it and it had some damage. We looked at it and the damage wasn't that bad a small area near the gas cap. He said he would make me a deal and they could fix it like new. I went to drive the truck and it had 5400 miles. The email he sent me said it had 2 miles. Again he said he would make me a deal! We found several more things that Scott said would all be taken care of before delivery. Nothing scott said was true . At the time of delivery the vehicle was filthy nothing that was to be fixed,was fixed. The dent was repaired but you could see the body work. The paint looked good. But he had not made me any deal. Other than the rebates that were on a brand new truck with 2 miles in brand new condition. I refused delivery of the truck . He brought in the poorest excuse for a manger I have ever dealt with  mr. Billy Bohner . I told him I did not want the vehicle and why. Billy played a little hocas pocus with the numbers . But the numbers don't lie . I wanted to undo the deal and I wanted my trade in back. And I would be on my way. He told me my trade had been sold. In the a State of Texas you can sign everything they put in front of you but until you drive it off the lot it's not yours. I told him several more times that I wanted out of the deal . He kept insisting my trade had been sold it was gone. I tried to use the onstar to find it but it wasn't working. So I took the truck figuring I would just have to take legal action. Meanwhile the next week the new truck was in their shop to get some of the issues fixed.Before I drove in the dealership to pick up the new truck.I tried the on star once more it worked and my trade was at the dealership. Turns out I didn't have to use the onstar my trade was at the service center when I pulled up,they were making it ready for sale. I was a bit upset I went up to the sales dept found Billy boy and let him know what I thought about him. Kevin Wildman was right there. Billy told me that we were done get off his lot. It wasn't until I filled out the Dealerrater survey before anyone at Huffines really gave a xxxx .When it came to Kevin Wildmans attention he called me and wanted the whole story ,not that he didn't already know the whole story. Kevin agreed with me .that I had been wronged . And he wanted to make it right with a check. Money back. I told him that the only thing I wanted was a new truck for the price I paid. He said would find me a truck and the only thing I had to do was remove the dealerrater survey. I agreed as long as it was the same exact truck same equipment no less but more would be fine. A couple days later he said he had the truck I went to the dealership it was not the same vehicle It was a lesser truck . I was going to walk . To take legal action he said you have your lawyers we have ours. So he told Scott to look at what was on the lot. We found the same color vehicle but much higher priced with more equipment. For not the same purchase price but roughly the same payment amount. For removing the dealerrater survey which I did and sent the confirmation to Scott . He also added that I give Scott a good GM survey. I agreed to do that. Meanwhile the new trucks not clean at delivery and when I washed it I found some stuff on the door and the hood. I called the manager at the body shop and set up a time when could look at it . When he looked at it he told me he could buff the stuff out on the door but the stuff on the hood had ruined the finish. The whole hood would have to be painted. Now I'm going to have a brand new truck with a painted hood. I was not happy . I went up to the sales floor found Kevin and showed him the spots and told him the hood would have to be painted and there was know way I could give Scott a good GM review. He was very condescending said he lost 5 grand on this deal and he just should have undone the deal. Well that let me know where he stood as far a customer satisfaction vs money. Not that I hadn't already figured that out . So I had set up a time to bring my truck in to be painted . Mark wasn't there they asked me for my insurance told me there was no loaner . So I left . Called Scott . They called me back in a few days reset it up. With a loaner and the dealership would pay . So on a Monday reluctantly I took the truck in . I was supposed to meet with Kevin for some reason but he wasn't there so Scott looked at the areas and looked the truck over. I got in the loaner and left 10 days later they told me my truck was ready. I went to pick it up. The
hood looks good,for now. But the stuff under the molding was still there. 10 days they had it, 10 fricken days and now the kid who is supposed to be my advisor is trying to scratch the stuff off the door with his fingernail . So I get in the truck to leave look up and my windshield is cracked. So I show the advisor who says he will talk to his manager. I went up to the showroom Kevin wasn't there Scott wasn't there Billy was there. But what's the point talking to a guy that you know just spews lies. So I left. They called me back a couple days later said it would be a week to 10 days or so before they could get the windshield. So since I believe it was intentionally broken no way am I taking it back to Huffines ever. It's a nice looking truck and I have had lots of complements . which gives me the opportunity to share my disgust with  Huffines. And I'm sure when Kevin and the other fine folks at Huffines read this they may wish I had never stepped foot on their lot . Let me assure you bud their is no one who wishes I had never stepped foot on your lot more than I do.

I talk to Steve Williamson on the phone a few times letting him know what color, model and equipment I wanted on the Trax.  After 2.5 hours at Five Star Chevy and no closer to the price we wanted to pay for a Trax. I walked out very unhappy, in fact didn't want to buy a car period. But I had made an appointment with Steve Williamson at 3:00.

So we left for our appointment at Huffines late. Letting Steve know how upset I was, he said lets get you driving out of here with the car you want and a prices we can all agree on.  Will that he did. We brought a Chevy Trax on Saturday (01/09/2016).  It was the best car buying experience we have ever had and we were not there for hours playing that bait and switch game like we had been at Five Star Chevy.

I just wanted to said thank you to Steve Williamson and everyone that help make this the best car buying experience EVER.

401,"December 19, 2015","My husband and I drove down from Oklahoma City to buy a Chevrolet Volt at Huffines Chevrolet in Lewisville, TX because they had the exact car we were looking for (or so we thought).

We spoke with Greg Sikes online before we drove down, we had planned on going to Texas on Saturday morning but Friday night we changed our minds and made the trip without informing him (Sorry Greg!).

When we got there it was 7PM on Friday. We looked at the car and were greeted by Oscar Gonzalez. He was super friendly, it didn't seem forced at all, he was just a really cool guy. He was very comfortable to be around.

When we got into the car with Oscar to take a test drive we realized that it didn't have a backup camera which really bummed us out as we had researched these cars for a long while and somehow missed the fact that this car did not have a backup camera even though it had the Premium trim package. We just put it back into park and didn't even test drive it. We looked at another Volt on the lot, this one had a backup camera and the safety features for lane changing but the seats were a creamy beige and not fully leather which I really did not like.

We compared the two Volts for a while and Oscar let us have all the time we needed. We didn't feel pressured at all, instead of looming over us while we compared them he went back inside to talk to another customer he'd been seeing to before we drove up.

We eventually decided we'd rather have the original Volt we went to see because (aside from the backup camera) it had the black leather seats and the black and white dash we wanted.

We informed him of our decision and he got our paperwork started that very night. He gave us a good deal on our trade in and said it was because he told his manager that I was so disappointed about the lack of a backup camera.

We had all of the paperwork done with Eric Tanner from financing within a very short amount of time and we were completely done with paperwork before 9PM. My husband spotted a discrepancy in the mileage so we didn't sign the odometer statement that night. We decided we'd do it Saturday morning because I wanted to get out of there so that Eric could get home and we were tired from the drive. 

Since we had driven from Oklahoma we stayed at a hotel that night and left our new Volt at the dealership so that it could charge overnight. When Saturday morning rolled around we were told that my husband was correct about the odometer numbers being different on the car vs paperwork. To make up for ""our trouble"", as they called it, they gave the Volt another full detail, a full tank of gas, fully charged the battery, added an extra 12,000 miles to our extended warranty, an oil change and four free oil changes and a year of free tire rotations from any GM dealer in the US.

Needless to say, we were very VERY pleased with our experience from start to finish and would recommend Huffines of Lewisville to ANYONE. Every single person we worked with was excellent. Even the other employees that we came into contact (the receptionist, the other dealers) they were all very friendly and welcoming. I definitely think everyone should give them a chance. When it's time for my next purchase I will definitely be looking to them first.

406,"November 19, 2015","I'm sorry to say especially after reading all these 5 star service ratings that my experience was nothing like those at all. I went to Huffines in Lewisville even though there's a Huffines just a mile from my house because they have a car that I wanted to buy. I had my sister in law drive me over so I could drive my new car home! When we arrived we walked around the front used car lot looking at the cars there. It took at least 15 minutes for someone to come out and greet us. There were at least 4 or 5 other people inside as well. While we were looking at the front row cars a salesman drove by us 3 times but never even acknowledged us. When Lance came out I told him I was interested in the Volt. It seemed like he tried to talk me out of it. I asked if we could test drive one. He got the keys and we took it for a spin. I've been researching this car for 5 months now but I had never actually driven one. When we got back we went to the office and filled out paperwork. I didn't want my credit report pulled before I knew we were gonna make a deal but I got tired of trying to explain why and just gave in. I'm trying to get up to 800. He went to the back, pulled it and brought back a completed buyers order. He explained it all to me. When I told him the price he put in the sales price box is not what I wanted to offer, he got upset. He said he had be up front and honest and didn't play that back and forth thing with me. He told me there was no way that they would take my offer because the price he gave me was the price they bought it for. (The price he put in the box is the price that's on it, not a special deal, sticker price.) Who just comes and pays sticker price?? He said that it had been sitting there awhile and they would just send it back to auction before they sold it for less. He stuck out his hand to shake hands for me to leave so we got up. He walked off to Aaron then brought him back and they both shook our hands, gave us each a card and said bye. My sister in law was wanting to trade her suv in for a truck but he kept saying he thinks it has been sold. I really just don't understand why he didn't want our business. My credit score is 752. She is not my wife. 

I've gotta update my review. A few days later Kevin Wildman called me and talked to me about my experience. He was so apologetic for how I was feeling. He said that they are very interested in selling me that car. We came to an agreement on price where we were both happy. I went in the next day and picked it up. I LOVE MY NEW VOLT! (new to me) Lance came and picked me up from my house. I thought I would feel uncomfortable with Lance but he didn't even mention that I had talked to Kevin. Anthony had all the paperwork ready and it didn't take an hour to finish up. Lance had my Volt washed, charged and full of gas! I must say...I do recommend Lance to help you with your vehicle. He's funny and doesn't make you feel uncomfortable or scared. I truly appreciate Kevin for working with me to get my dream car.

417,"October 14, 2015","Just purchased a 2012 Toyota RAV4. Great car and a great buying experience. Craig was helpful and very easy to work with. Here is an example of what I considered service above and beyond. The car is three years old. It had a few paint dings. Minor stuff. But I was eventually going to buy some touch up paint and see what I could do. But Craig offered the services of their on staff touch up guy to do it for me for free. Honestly, I have no idea if this is something that I should have expected as it is normal these days. It's been ten years since I bought a car. But you would think a used car would probably come ""as is"". Craig and Huffines didn't think so. Maybe all other dealers are this way. I don't know. Don't really care about other dealers. I was impressed by what might have been a very small thing. There is only so much a dealer can reasonably do as far as price goes. So all the other things matter. ",5.0

420,"October 05, 2015","I had the distinct pleasure of purchasing a new vehicle with salesman Craig Martin. Craig not only paid close attention to specifically what I was looking for, but took me through at least 10 or 11 cars as he ran all over the lot to find one that met my needs. He ensured to point out features in comparison to other vehicles I'd seen to ensure I didn't miss any details (and I would have if not for him) without any pushiness or impatience whatsoever. He was ""cool as a cucumber"" for over 2 hours! The purchase process was painless and Craig's efficiency - and humor - was much appreciated. Everyone at the dealership was very friendly. I am thrilled with the purchase of my new Equinox (pre-owned). The car was turned over to me immaculate, and Craig ensured to take the extra time to again review all of the interior features and ensure I understood how they worked, plus setting up OnStar. I couldn't have asked for better service, and I just love my new vehicle. Thanks so much to Craig and Team - I will be a repeat customer.",5.0

426,"September 06, 2015","I brought in a 2006 Chevy Malibu SS on behalf of my mother who has been having significant power steering issues (sudden loss of power steering and leaks). Originally, the car was addressed at a separate shop (not GM). After having continuous issues, we decided to allow the dealership handle it.
We met with the service rep who would be helping us (Mike). I showed him the receipts for the previous work done (replacement of the rack and pinion, tie rods, power steering pump and high pressure line).  The first thing he mentioned is that the receipts do not state whether or not the parts were replaced with GM parts therefore he assumed GM parts were not used.  (they did not state any other manufacturer either) but I did advise that I was told GM parts would be (and were) installed by the previous shop.
The following day Mike called and stated that the power steering (ps) pump was noisy and may need replacement. He stated the real issue is the steering gear which was leaking.  He made the statement that the part was not a GM part. My original thought was that it must have been replaced at the prior shop but that I did not recall a steering gear being on the previous receipts.  Also, the shop had told me they did indeed use GM parts. I called the previous shop who stated they would warranty it or give me the money back but that they would need the part.  After calling Mike back, he refused to give me the part back stating that their dealership would be charged $100 for not returning the core.  I asked why they would want a part that supposedly was not GM. He hesitated then told me that GM would not care and would take the part anyway.  long story short - the part WAS actually a GM part which was validated by Mike after much discussion.  I lost a lot of confidence in him.  Also, the steering gear is part of the rack and pinion (which was replaced by the previous shop). I did not make the connection and neither did Mike who should have being in this line of work.
After much discussion with Mike, he blankly asked (with an attitude) what I wanted him to do and reminded me that I did not have to have the work done there.  He definitely did not act as if he wanted our business, much less showed an interest in resolving our problem.  After telling him that what I want is to speak to someone above him, he told me that he would pass on a message but that the Manager is busy in meetings all day. I had to ask for his name multiple times - each time Mike reminding me that the Manager is too busy.
At this point, I did not know what to do - I felt caught between a rock and a hard place. After speaking to the previous shop who did the work they agreed to deliver a rack and pinion to the dealership for installation at no cost. I advised Mike who said they would charge me the labor.
Mike had advised several times that he would not know about the power steering pump until everything was put back together and they would test it out.  He even mentioned installing a ""gear"" in the pump that may resolve the issue ( I have never heard of a dealership wanting to fix a component like a pump themselves - its usually remove and replace).
Mike later called me and stated that the high pressure line required replacement and it was poor workmanship by the prior shop.  At this point I just felt as if there was no one I could trust - the other shop had great customer service but did not correct the issue. The dealership had extremely poor customer service and I was hesitant to deal with them in the future.  Either way, I was so exhausted from all of the back and forth phone calls that I asked Mike to proceed and change the line.  On a Friday evening he called me and stated that everything is well but that the pump had to be replaced.  I told him to leave it as is and I would pick up the car - the pump would be replaced by the previous shop and they would warranty the part and labor. He seemed surprised by this...hesitated, then told me fine, but they still had a line to install so the car may be done by Saturday afternoon. In my mind, I was thinking that if you were supposed to put everything back together before knowing whether or not the pump needed replacement, then how do you know the pump is bad if you still have a line to install? Honestly, conversations with Mike (and his lack of credibility) were so exhausting throughout the week and he constantly contradicted himself. At this point, I did not argue the point - I just wanted the work done.
The car was ready on Saturday and I picked it up.  Mike (who had changed his tune by this point)went through the receipt with me stating that they did not charge me labor on the line as a ""service to me"".  Perhaps they didn't, but what they charged me for the part was well over the list price quoted by GM Parts Now (let alone the discounted price by which is significantly different).  Therefore, I feel I paid in labor.
The bottom line, Mike has extremely poor customer service.  He was rude, short, dismissive, and condescending. It took me stating (several times) that I would ensure to discuss the poor customer service I had received to have him change his tone.  He tried to excuse his behavior by stating his tone does not change and he is very direct. Let me be clear, being direct is not an issue - making me feel as if I am being lied to, taken advantage of, and providing the ""I don't owe you anything"" attitude is a problem. He treated me as if I were a nuisance.
I did not show up with an attitude nor am I difficult to speak with until you make me feel I am getting a raw deal. In order to cool down from this experience, I waited a few weeks to respond to this survey to really absorb my experience - hindsight is usually 20/20.  My feelings have not changed. My only prayer is that I never have to return to this dealership and deal with Mike again.  He may have become more cordial toward the end, but it was not because it is the service he provides - it felt obligatory and it was frankly too late.  He should not be in customer service.  Especially not with what this dealership's website states about their pride in customer service. I found it to be quite the opposite.",1.3

Our salesman Lance, was friendly and knowledgeable about the vehicle (not so much the information  to do with Titles and such though), and we all liked him.
However; 
Nobody else was really all that friendly, we witnessed salesman fighting/arguing about phone calls and playing around, and the guy doing the finance paperwork just acted 'ho-hum' like he had better things to do than be with us (maybe because we brought a Bank check), just overall an unprofessional atmosphere with way too many people doing nothing!
Biggest problem we had is with what they called a 'Detail"", which was more like a good car wash but not a good cleaning. Just make sure your vehicle is clean because ours wasn't and unfortunately it was a cloudy, rainy day so it wasn't noticed until we got home about 5 hours later.  Door jambs, engine compartment, interior dash, trunk jambs and other various spot completely missed!
Maybe if we were locals we would have gotten the gold star treatment and brought the car back to get it done right, maybe they should have paid for a detail in our town!!!

465,"February 11, 2015","I found a 2014 pre owned Honda Ridgeline on line with only 5500 miles and contacted the internet sales department at Huffines Chevrolet Lewisville.  The sales rep told me the truck was like new.  He said he did a walk around the vehicle and it was in perfect condition.  We agreed on price and I purchased a ticket to fly in to Dallas to pick up the truck.  The sales rep even picked me up at the airport.  

At the Huffines everything went fine until I noticed the five small dents in the passenger door.  The rep said this could be fixed via paintless dent removal.  The next day when the dent technician came to fix the vehicle he was surprised and said ""I already fixed this one.  These dents are what remain after I pulled out the large dent and one on the other side of the truck too.  I told the dealership to send the truck to the body shop.""

I called the sales rep and asked what could be done.  He said ""We've already lowered the price so bring the truck back.""  I replied ""fine"".  A few minutes later the sales rep called back and stated that body work on the door should only be $200-300 and Huffines would discount the truck $300.  Having recently had body work done on my old car I was skeptical.  I took the truck to a national collision repair chain and was given an estimate for $1212.00.  I called the sales rep and told him I was bringing the truck back.  When I arrived at Huffines they were polite but there was no apology.  The pre owned sales manager spoke to me and knew the situation but again no apology.    

So my question is ""Did the sales rep know the vehicle was damaged?""  If so, then he is dishonest and was hoping I wouldn't notice the dents.  If he didn't know the vehicle was damaged then the staff at Huffines don't communicate well as the dent technician had already notified them the truck needed to go to the body shop.  They kept it on the lot hoping some poor schmuck wouldn't notice.  Further, when I noticed and challenged them the failed to take responsibility, properly fix the truck and complete the sale or satisfy me as a customer.

Now I'm out $385 for the airline ticket there and back.  It is unfortunate that dealerships such as Huffines give the car business a bad name.  I have purchased three vehicles on line with no problem.  The moral of the story ""Let the buyer beware when doing business with Huffines.""",2.2

473,"November 21, 2014","There is a lot of the ""same"" in the retail and service world.  There are the same vehicles, the same price the same service.  Obviously, to be competitive business that are in the car business and believe that they are actually more in the service business strive to do whatever it takes to be competitively better in creating a unique car buying / servicing experience and relationship.  
Well,  David Maynard with Hiffines Chevrolet in Lewisville gets it.  
My experience started with curiosity for the Chevy Coloriado and ""stuff.""  My search began online as I frankly wanted to avoid the hassle and the ""sale"" experience.  I went on line to make inquiries and committed to visiting the first dealership that made my potential business a priority.  So a few clicks later and now I would wait to see who responded.  This was about 9pm on a Thursday night.  I received some standard copy replies, but David was the first to send me a personalized email,  he even included a picture of the vehicle.  I replied and we continued the discussion for the next few hours finally setting an appointment for the the following day at 1130.

To shorten the story, I was met with professionalism, efficiency and what came across as a true commitment to the relationship.  Moreover. David made sure to guarantee my satisfaction with all facets of what would become my new Chevy experience.  He sold the dealership, the service department and the Huffines brand.  All this is fine and well, but the true test is when things are not gong well, can the brand and David rise to put actions where words were once used?  The resounding answer, YES!

Through very unfortunate circumstances. I was not a week into enjoying my truck when my new car fell victim to vandals manipulating my fuel system.  Of course, being unaware of any such vandals, this problem had to be a Chevy and ""stuff"" problem and I was sure to challenge David and Huffines to make this right.  

Again, David was available, reachable and he ensured me of resolution and we processed the next steps.  Fast forward to Wednesday night - 8pm - David met me at the dealership, set me up with a loaner car and put my truck into service.

Over the next 48 hours the problem was identified and resolved.  Most importantly, was how the problem was resolved.  David, nor Huffines, nor Chevy had any liability.  Yet, David, the General Manager and Mike McClarty in Service teamed up and went into action making this right all the while ensuring my satisfaction.

Thank you David and the entire Huffines, Lewisville team on making great promises and more importantly, stepping up when it would have been easy to step aside. 

Thank you

490,"July 01, 2014","I was looking for a reasonably priced used car for my fiancee as his truck had seen it's safest days long in the rearview mirror.  I found a beautiful 2006 Ford Fusion SEL V6 online listed for a reasonable price.  I went into the dealership at 4:15pm on a Saturday knowing full well that I had to be somewhere at 6pm and thinking that at least I could look at the car and come back later...I thought there was no way I could purchase the car in that timeframe.  

I spoke to Bert Agauyo who had called me because I'd submitted a question online to see if the vehicle I was interested in was still available.  He greeted me at the door of the dealership and had pulled the car around front, washed it, all in about 10 minutes since I originally called.

I drove the car with Bert, asked him all my questions, looked the car over and told him I would like to move forward with the car but that I had a limited amount of time.  I offered what I was willing to pay for the vehicle which they readily accepted (even though it was below the 'fair market value' on kbb.com, I had looked before I went in and their list price was exactly fair market value).  

I told Bert that I HATED working with the finance department at dealerships because, well, everyone knows that the Sales People are the ones who are going to try to sell you a car (which you want to buy) and the finance people are the ones who are going to try to sell you a bill of goods, which most people aren't interested in.  I've walked out of SEVERAL car deals in my life from the finance office.  Bert informed me that their guys were usually pretty good to work with and told me to let him know if I felt otherwise.

I waited for the finance department representative Eric Tanner to come and get me for about 30 minutes, which tested my patience.  But, when Mr. Tanner got me back to his office I immediately informed him that I was in a bit of a time crunch and he literally got me thru all the paperwork WITHOUT TRYING TO SELL ME ANYTHING I DIND'T WANT within less than 10 minutes.  I was floored.

I told them I'd bring the car back on Monday to get it detailed, and on Monday I brought it back.  Bert immediately told me that they were backed up and offered to pay for me to get a rental car.  I accepted the rental car and am waiting for them to call me when my car is ready.  This dealership is absolutely working on a whole different level of customer service and I am a truly satisfied customer!",5.0
491,"June 24, 2014","I have never been treated as poorly as I was treated at Huffines Chevrolet in Lewisville. I am very upset with how the service advisor (Mike McLarty) acted towards me. When I arrived Wednesday morning for my appointment to have the recall fixed on my car, Mike was busy with another customer so a different service advisor greeted me and happily checked me in. I let him know that I would be waiting for my car, as I did not have a ride arranged and he very graciously offered to get me a loaner car so I could run errands and not be stuck at the dealership for the next 3 hours. I agreed, handed him both of my key chains (one with my aftermarket remote start remote and 1 key and another with both factory remotes and my spare key) and he told me to wait in the customer lounge and they would pull the car up for me. About an hour later (I figured both he and Mike had gotten busy and did not want to bother them about the loaner car), Mike came into the lounge, asked me to sign a paper and handed me my 2 factory remotes. After signing, I asked him about the loaner car and he responded very hastily and seemingly annoyed that he did not have one and rushed off. He did not explain what it was I was signing and again not wanting to bother him since he seemed to be in a bad mood, I just did what he asked. I then got a hold of my husband and explained the situation to him, he then came and picked me up to grab a snack. On our way to get a snack, I called the service department to find out how many loaner cars they have all together. Mike answered, I asked my question and he replied with 5-6 and then realized who I was and said my name. I told him thank you and hung up. 7 minutes late, he called me back to let me know he had found a loaner car for me. My husband answered and let him know I would not need it and that we would be back in an hour to pick up my car. When we arrived at the dealership to pick up my car, I asked my husband to accompany me inside since I did not feel comfortable going in alone. We checked out and Mike brought me my keys. My husband is an auto tech and had installed an aftermarket remote start in my car so he told me to make sure it still worked and did not need to be re-programmed. I looked around my car (purse, glove box, cup holders, floor boards, console, under the console, and passenger seat) and could not find my remote. I took the key chain Mike had previously handed to me and went back inside to let him know my remote was missing and maybe the mechanic had forgotten to bring it back since it would have needed to be re-programmed. Mike met me at the door to the service department and after I told him the situation proceeded to badger me, raising his voice telling me he handed it to me. I went back to my car and retrieved the key chain he had previously handed to me in the lounge with only the 2 factory remotes on it and showed him this was the key chain he had handed me. He then talked over me to my husband telling him that I was wrong and he had given it to me, etc. This is my car, I had made the appointment and am the only owner of this car. For him to talk over me as if I did not exist is in my opinion demeaning and disrespectful to me as a customer. Instead of raising his voice and talking over me, it would have been more effective if he would have called the mechanic so he could tell us where he had placed the remote after re-programming it. My husband suggested we go back to my car to look some more. After looking some more, I moved the driver‚Äôs seat (I had moved it to look in the backseat) and adjusted the seat back to see the remote had been left in the seat and had made its way into the crease where the cushion and seat back meet. So after Mike raising his voice and vehemently insisting he had given it back to me, it was obvious he hadn't. After finding it, Mike hurried back inside without so much as an apology for the way he treated and talked to me. I feel as though Mike perpetuated the stereotype of vehicle repair/dealerships mistreatment of women. I understand dealerships must be exhausted taking care of over 12 million recalls so far this year but I do not feel that in any way is an excuse for his behavior. I had to bring my defective car back for repair on my own time. I would think you would like to fix your mistake and secure a future, young customer; instead I received unacceptable treatment from your service advisor.

At first, we considered giving our son my wife's 2011 Equinox and getting her a new one but the cost and trouble of trying to get the car from Austin to Dallas and transfer license plates, etc. convinced us to just get our son a new Equinox.  I began working long distance with David Maynard, my Huffines salesman.  David made everything very easy for me, especially since this was all done over the phone.  My son, who was busy working 6 days a week. took enough time to go pick out the color and David and I negotiated the price very quickly.  I feel we got a very good deal and my son absolutely loves the car.  David made some very key suggestions on what features we would want on the car while keeping it as inexpensive as possible.  He suggested the car have the convenience package on it for the remote start and the 8 way power adjustable drivers seat.  My son fell in love with the adjustable drivers seat - he is 6""1 and was able to adjust the seat to fit him perfectly - something he never had been able to do before.

I came into the dealership that evening to look at the truck. I mostly came in being curious, but was blown away with the truck. MG was on duty and kindly showed me the truck and went for a test drive. This was the most impressive truck that I have seen or driven. I have had Chevrolets or GMCs since 1973. 

Drew Ward was very helpful in getting the numbers right so a deal could be made. Eric Tanner was very efficient and courteous in the finance department. This is my 3rd truck that I have purchased from Huffines Chevrolet. The entire staff has been great, very friendly, and went the extra mile to make me feel at home with my purchase.

I have used the service department in the past and it is the best. They are very professional and helpful.

Lee was helping us quickly and was very knowledgeable and helpful.  We left the dealership after looking at the car and test driving.  We knew that was the car we wanted but, felt like we needed to wait a month or two.  When we were at lunch and talking about the car, we decided to go back and price the vehicle.  Everyone was very helpful and we decided to buy the car.  Lee helped us with the paperwork and Eric spoke with us about the warranties, etc., etc.  I did not get his name, but another individual in finance came in and ask us to redo the paperwork because he had found a lower interest rate.  We did and after a tutorial from Lee and pairing our phones we were back on the road to Wichita Falls.  So far, we are extremely happy with our decision and the help we got from Huffines.  ",4.8

519,"November 23, 2013","My husband and I were looking for a used car that was reliable and within our budget. We went to Huffines Chevrolet in Lewisville where Zach Blohm helped us out. We were so impressed with Zach, he is the type of salesman we enjoy doing business with! Not only was he friendly, but he talked with us and helped us find exactly what we were looking for. He didn't try to ""sell-up"" as I call it, which is a big turn-off. When we found what we wanted and completed the sale, he made sure the car was clean and ready for us, making sure the car was fully inspected. The back tires did not pass inspection, so the service department replaced them! Zach also took care of swapping the turn knob that my husband requires from our old car into the new one. 

We went to see Eric Tanner for the financial part, who worked on getting us as much bang for our bucks as he could. He got us some extras that we needed, and kept us as close to our budget as he could. And did I mention how friendly he was as well? He answered all our questions completely and with a smile!

We will share our wonderful experience with all our friends and family, with high recommendations. Thank you for treating us so well!

Other dealers heard what we wanted but stopped short of taking the time to check the local inventory. Kelly did this and won the business.

Everything was handled prior to us ever stepping foot on the dealer lot. It took 45 minutes on a Friday night to get in, sign, go over the safety check for the vehicle and leave.

Keith Miller listened to everything we had to say and showed us options based on what we wanted.  He never once was pushy or tried to sell us something other than what we specifically said we liked.  He showed us 3 or 4 cars on the lot and when I mentioned a vehicle I had seen on the website that was currently at another Huffines, he brought it right over for us to test drive.  Keith even made himself available for us to call him at anytime with any question we had.  I ended up having to call him twice and he was ready and available to answer my question both times.  Great guy!
During the financing, we worked with Eric Tanner.  He was amazing at explaining every part of the process and offering us relevant options for our certified pre-owned vehicle.  He was fun and warm and made the process very painless.

529,"September 15, 2013","This past labor day weekend, my husband and I thought it would be a good weekend to look for another car since we are handing over my current vehicle to our daughter. We first went to Nissan in the same strip as Huffines. We walked around for a good 10mins, and never got any help. Then, we drove by and saw Huffines... and we thought to give it a try. We ended up buying a 2013 Chevy Cruze. 

The biggest incentive for us to buy the car from this dealership was because of our sales rep Craig Martin. He wasn't the typical sales guy that will just talk you into buying any car. Craig greeted us as soon as we got out of our car. He was very attentive to what we were looking for, laid back and just too awesome. The rest of the staff were also great!  When I walked into the other building, as soon as I open the door, another sales person greeted me and asked if I was being helped. I was thirsty, so I asked the receptionist to change my $10 bill, she didn't have any change... but insisted to give me change and buy a soda. She didn't have to do that, but it shows how nice the people are that work there. We will definitely come back to this dealership and buy our next car. Thank you ",5.0

 ‚ÄúHuffines includes added protection with all leases . ""

  
    When I asked what the value was.  She said ‚Äú399 and 499.     My son thought she meant the value was $4.99 and $3.99 per month.

536,"July 11, 2013","I originally came to Huffines Chevrolet Lewisville a few months ago looking to get a new Tahoe and that is when I met Jacky Brown and Jason Janacek. Jacky was the Salesman and Jason the Sales manager. Jacky immediately made an outstanding impression on me, he was very friendly and humble and not pushy at all to say the least. He took the time to review the vehicle with me in detail and described all of the features and was even offered by both Jacky and Jason to take the vehicle home over the weekend to try out, that offer was very nice but I decided to hold off from getting a Tahoe at that time.

Then once again recently about a few weeks ago I was considering getting a new 2013 Camaro and I immediately though of Jacky Brown over at Huffines Chevrolet Lewisville based on the great experience I had with him last time when I was looking at a Tahoe.

Once again Jacky was waiting for me outside the dealership and warmly greeted me with a big smile and firm handshake. He listened attentively for all of the features I was wanting in a Camaro such as options, color, navigation, etc. He quickly got the keys for a new 2013 Camaro base model to let me drive and get the idea of how this car runs and operates. I was greatly impressed with the vehicle but even happier with the service and time Jacky was giving me which helped me make a decision on finally the vehicle I wanted. After the 1st test drive I was not fully decided on the vehicle I wanted so he even brought the car to my home to show me again and my family, that was very nice of Jacky to go out of his way to do this for me. Once I finally decided what I wanted the exact model and color and loaded options of the Camaro sold at the dealership before I was ready to buy.  Jacky really felt bad for me and started locating the exact vehicle I wanted and discovered there was only 1 left in the nation since it was a rare Camaro to come by. Jacky and Jason quickly ordered the car for me to have it shipped right away and it arrived within a few days and it was looking perfect with less than 30 miles and he even went above and beyond to put and replace the special wheels I wanted too. Overall Jacky kept me constantly updated and even gave me his personal cell # so we could talk or text anytime on the status of my vehicle and to answer any questions I had while we were waiting for the vehicle to arrive at the dealership. While I was waiting for my car to arrive I was offered by Jacky and Jason a new Camaro as a loaner vehicle which was very nice of them, I felt that they really cared respected me and wanted me to be happy. When it came time to talk numbers and do the deal on the vehicle sales price they actually gave me a deal that was very competitive compared to other dealers around the area, there was no haggle involved at all and I did not feel pressured in any way. I was very happy the negotiating part went very smooth and easy and Jason approved the price I requested on the spot.

While I was waiting for my car to arrive I was able to complete the paperwork with Rebecca Baker in finance. She was very friendly and professional and kindly offered me the maintenance, wheel/tire and extended warranty plans. I was in her office no more than 10 minutes to complete the paperwork! That was the fastest time ever for me to buy a car, it was a wonderful experience.

When the car finally arrived it looked spectacular and Jacky ensured it would be perfect inside and out, after showing me the car Jacky offered to show me the service department and introduced me to the people there and even explained the upcoming maintenance that would be required for my vehicle. He even offered me my 1st oil change for free! Jacky then took me to my car and explained in detail how all of the features and options worked and took the time to elaborate on my questions about the features and the On-star, radio, navigation, driving features, etc. Then after explaining everything he asked me again if there was anything else that he should explain and said I could call him anytime afterwards as well if I needed anything or had any questions on my car. I actually did have to call him later that night after the dealership closed and he answered my question I had about one of the options.

Overall Jacky Brown went way above and beyond my expectations for my experience in buying my new car with him after this experience I would say Jacky is the best car salesman on the Planet Earth that has ever existed PERIOD! Jacky was always very professional, patient, a great attitude and had a big smile on his face for the whole duration working with me and giving me all of his time. Jacky treated me with great respect and dignity and he was very humble and one of the friendliest people I have ever met in my life. Jacky should be a role model Salesman for the entire dealership and all of Chevrolet to look up to.

Bottom Line if you‚Äôre in the DFW area and want to buy a Chevrolet please look no further than the Mr Jacky Brown at Huffines Chevrolet Lewisville, he is a very honest, friendly, and professional Salesman expert .

537,"June 29, 2013","I have had quite a horrible experience with this dealerships service department. I have a brand new $40,000 vehicle, with only 3,000 miles on it.  The service center was supposed to fix a missing insignia letter. They SHOULD have sent it to their body shop, which has the tools to safely remove the letters. Instead, the mechanics in the service center went at the letters with a jackhammer (or some equivalent) and scratched my paint. They made me wait several days for them to fix it, and assured me it would look like new. When I went to pick it up, they had done a horrible job, leaving dirt under the clear coat. After waiting through another weekend, and another trip to the body shop to find unsatisfactory work, they were finally able to repair their own damage. I now have my car back, but my lettering is spaced unevenly, a permanent scar reminding me to watch who I deal with. I was without my car for over a week, over what should have been a two hour ordeal of replacing one glued-on letter. On a $40,000 vehicle, brand new, I expect them to make it look like new, but as Mark, the Body Shop Manager told me, ""The manufacturer can't make it perfect, so you shouldn't expect me to make it perfect."" That's interesting to me, considering my paint job was perfect before Huffines Chevrolet touched it. I don't advise anyone to take any vehicle to this dealership, for any reason.

I called the day prior and spoke to Mike and explained what was wrong with my vehicle(it was making a strange noise).  He was able to schedule me for the next morning first thing.  When I brought my vehicle in he greeted me promptly and asked me to recreate the problem for him which I did and he verified what I was hearing was not normal.  This was so refreshing as in my prior experiences with other dealerships they would not do this, they would just have me describe the noise and then they would go and try to find it.  This was such a hands on approach and I was really impressed.  I also asked him to do some additional work (oil change, alignment) and he told me he could have it all done by the end of the day.  He asked me if I needed a ride (I had already arranged for a rental car).  He called me throughout the day to give me updates, and informed me of a recall that needed to be taken care of, and gave me the diagnosis of the problem.  He quoted me the price before the work started, and his quote was accurate.  When I picked up my car he gave me a thorough run down of what was done, and walked me to the cashier.  He informed me on how to receive a mail in rebate.  I was very impressed with Mike and his thoroughness and knowledge.  Whenever I need service, I will be bringing my Trailblazer back to him!!",5.0

546,"February 28, 2013","This was absolutely the best experience I have ever had purchasing a car. What genuinely surprised me was how all the staff, not just the ones that you know earn a commission from the deal, bent over backwards to take care of you while you were waiting and looking at cars. Of course it also helps that I got the absolute best deal on the vehicle we were purchasing to make the overall experience a really good one.  I researched the prices extensively before we went and I could not find a better deal anywhere (believe me I looked). It turned out when we went to look at the cars on the lot, that they did not actually have the car that I wanted on hand at the dealership. What I liked was that instead of wasting my time trying to sell me something I didn't want, they went out and found it for me from their sister dealership and got the car for me at the exact price that I wanted to spend. How can you do better than that at a car dealership? Well there is one thing that made the experience even better and that was having a knowledgable and friendly staff that worked very hard to get me what I  wanted. If you are looking for a car salesman that does a fantastic job then ask for Agence Smith. We did not go there requesting him, we just got lucky! if you want to save yourself the grief of feeling like your are dealing with a slick willy oil salesman and the exasperation of a typical car buying experience then go see Agence at Huffines Chevrolet. Super nice guy and will work incredibly hard to make sure you get exactly what you want. I am very picky especially when spending my money and he made sure that I got everything I wanted in the perfect condition. In fact he personally drove 30 miles to the other dealership to inspect the car to make sure he thought that it would meet my expectations before bringing it back for me to see it. What car salesman do you know does that? He got an A++++ in my book for the over the top effort! I also have to say Drew Ward, while  not a saleman but a dealer trade manager also went beyond what a normal person would have done to make sure that we walked away thrilled with our purchase. He really made the overall car buying experience incredibly fun instead of the normal tedious grind. I think we spent half our time in Drews ofice just visiting and cutting up while we were ironing out the paperwork for our purchase.

I was very grateful when I contacted you and you made everything so easy for me. 

You were very attentative when I spoke with you and told you what we were looking for. I explained to you that I needed a reliable vehicle to send my son off to college in. You understood that I was putting my most precious possession into a truck and needed something that would sustain him for the next few years. I felt very comfortable with you and did not feel pressured at all. We are very happy with the deal and the truck as well. 

You were very respectful towards me and made me feel like I was very important...unlike other salesmen I had run into the past few weeks.  Just one thing to tell the other salesman, when dealing with a woman is not to refer back to ""why don't you bring in your husband to seal the deal"".....

559,"November 21, 2012",My wife and I bought a 2012 Chevrolet Tahoe basically over the phone from Salesman Dana Middleton. This is my second vehicle to buy from Huffines Chevrolet this year and I drove 3 hours from East Texas to buy from Huffines again. My wife has owned four Tahoes over the years and she knew exactly what she wanted. We arrived late at the dealership around 8:15 PM and was able to complete the sale in less than an hour. Dana was very courteous and we are very pleased with the Tahoe and the dealership. Our financing was handled by Rebecca Baker and she was able to get us a good interest rate and the paperwork was all completed and ready when we arrived. Very nice dealership and good people.

562,"November 07, 2012","I had identified the vehicle I was interested in and drove out to the dealership to drive it. When I got there, I was informed that it had been moved to another location and possibly sold. Sales rep David Rumple took the time to call and double-check and found that the car had not been sold. He had the car brought back to Lewisville within a couple of hours and I went out the next morning and drove it. I loved the vehicle but had some loose ends to tie up elsewhere. David called me a couple of hours later and we confirmed my interset in the vehicle. I went back out to Lewisville to finalize the deal and found everything to be perfect. Without me asking, Sales Mgr. Aaron Brown, had even discounted the vehicle a little further so that it would fit within my $500.00 deposit and Capital One financing terms. Rebecca Baker in finance was very efficient, organized and a pleasure to work with. David Rumple was a consummate professional and very responsive and willing to answer any and all questions. He even helped me set up the OnStar system. This was a great buying experience and I highly recommend this group to everyone.

566,"October 31, 2012","This is the second time I have visited this dealership for service work done to my Corvette.  The first time I was overcharged for a rear leaf spring (something I could buy off , and ended up paying $800 and this is after I had never agreed to the install.  Keep in mind a better version of this part could be had for $120.  But I went ahead and paid it so I could get my car back.  The second time I went there was due to the car stopping while idle.  Turned out to be a bad battery and apparently the positive and negative battery cable was bad.  Now they wanted to charge $600+ for this job to be done.  I told the person I was working with that I would bring my own battery and with no verbal agreement about changing the cable, he went ahead and changed it anyways.  Now when I called back to tell him to change it back to stock, he said he would charge another 300 for service charge.  I really hate taking my car to dealerships where techs who think they know what they are doing try to talk to me about a car they don't know a lot about.  Honestly I will never take my car there again and I will make sure the many people on the corvette forums know to never take their cars to this dealership again.

569,"October 16, 2012","My recent experience with Huffines Lewisville was by far the best experience I have EVER had with ANY dealership!! At the 11th hour, in between shuffling 5 kids to various locations my car broke down. I was leaving town the next morning, Enterprise was closing shortly and there was no way I was going to make it there in time to drop off my vehicle and pick up my rental. Chris Schwarz professionally gathered my information, called Enterprise and arrange a vehicle large enough to accommodate my family (which isn't always available) and had everything waiting for me when I arrived. I literally signed the paperwork, hopped in my rental and left within a matter of minutes. 

He called me throughout the repair process to make sure I knew what was going on and went above and beyond (in my opinion) to diagnose the problem. When I arrived to return my rental, he noticed me and had my car pulled up and ready to go. Again, another process that literally was handled in minutes.

I have probably owned 15 new cars in my lifetime and have never had an experience with a dealership that was handled this professionally and flawlessly. 

I am more than pleased. Chris Schwarz/Huffines....Awesome job!!!

We spoke with Mr. Kenney, who provided us with ""royalty"" treatment, made sure we felt valued and let us know that Huffines really wanted to have us as customers.  We decided to give Huffines a chance and purchased a 2007 Chevy Avalanche that had been freshly delivered to the dealership.  They even put brand new wheels on the truck for us!  We have since received continued great customer service with Huffines (most recently through Allen Moore) as they truly do provide excellent customer service and desire to keep their sparkling reputation.

I bumped into this website and saw the reviews for Huffines... I have to say... their service matches exactly with the rating they have. They were extremely helpful and friendly. Matthew Collins, my service advisor couldn't hear the noise I was mentioning very clearly at the beginning, but he didn't just stop and said &quot;it's a normal noise, you can go home.&quot; He took the car in for the mechanic to listen, and in case the noise was normal, he offered to bring another car like mine to show me that it was, if that was the case. However, he went ahead and looked on their system for reported issues that may match my description and found a couple of recalls on the car that I was absolutely unaware of plus he found the issue that was most likely producing the noise. They took care of my car in the same day, completely hassle-free... Let me emphasize again, all the great reviews that are displayed here, are entirely true... If you're looking for a dealership to take your car in for service, even if you live a little far from Huffines, trust me and the other hundreds of satisfied customer, THIS IS WHERE YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR CAR!!!",5.0

I called Huffines and spoke with Oscar about trading in my Traverse for a cheaper more practical car.  He was so helpful and gave good suggestions about the different cars he had on hand that would work for me.  He even called me back to give me additional details that I hadn't thought of.  He was very thoughtful.  Honestly, everyone has such a mentality about car salesmen, but Oscar broke the mold! He went over and above!  I couldn't make in that same day but came in the following day to meet Oscar and help sealed the deal.  I had reviewed all the information he gave me and made my decision before I came in and all the numbers matched with what he told me the day before and with my research.  Nothing changed. It seems that never happens, but this time it did and that made it great! 
Oscar made my difficult situation into a good one.  
We had met with Elliot when we originally bought the Traverse and we were lucky enough to work with him again on the trade in for the Nissan Versa.  He explained everything clearly and moved through it effeciently and timely.  
I didn't get the names of everyone that we came in contact with but they were all friendly and accomodating.

On both occasions, I received the utmost customer service and he worked doggedly to make sure the process from start to finish was as quick and painless as possible.  Additionally, I spent no more than 2 and a half hours there, partly because we knew more or less what we were looking for rather than shooting from the hip.  I have gone to other places, perhaps looking to see if anyone might be able to one up Eric.  This was not the case as I ended up right back at his desk on the second go-round.

In the future, should you decide you are interested in purchasing a vehicle from this dealer, Eric Tanner is most definitely your guy.

582,"August 21, 2012","This is the second time I have reviewed Huffines for service.  The first review was glowing, as Brian O'Connor and his team were beyond fantastic.  I was raised to believe that the dealership is a den of crooks/thieves and that you should NEVER, EVER take your car to a dealership for regular maintenance or repairs.  Throughout my driving life, that largely proved to be true (based on stories from friends).  However, Brian and Huffines shocked me with honest evaluations of my car (i.e. not pressing me to buy some imaginary maintenance I don't need) and very competitive prices (i.e, as good or better than the local mechanic shop).  

After that first impression, I was worried that subsequent visits may not be as incredible.  After three or four times of bringing my Chevy Malibu to Huffines for service, I can happily report that the experience is still fantastic.  I work with Brian O'Connor every time (and you should too), and the work is done right at a great price each time. Brian is professional and actually understands and respects the phrase ""I'm on a budget."" He also seems to be a genuinely nice guy! Honest...nice...respectful...I'd invite this guy to Thanksgiving dinner!  When was the last time you could say that about someone in the auto industry?  

I will soon be moving cross-country for a new job, and I brought the car in for an oil change and a general ""look this thing over because I don't want to break down in Nashville"" visit. While this would have been an invitation to most auto service folks to invent thousands of dollars in imaginary repairs for my 70,000 mile car, Brian and Huffines returned the car to me with the oil change, a couple of new tires (which I really did need), a clean bill of health for the car, and a price that was both reasonable and UNDER the initial estimate. Not having Huffines to take my car to for service will actually be one of the things I miss about not living in Dallas.    ",5.0

588,"June 29, 2012","      This week I started looking for a truck to replace my Toyota Tundra that was totaled in May. To some this might be an adventure, but to me, I thought it was going to be a great big headache, what with having to maintain a job at the same time.
   The first couple of days were spent wading through the millions of choices on the internet. But it did help me come to several decisions. I knew that I wanted a Chevy or GMC, I knew my price range, what amenities I wanted, and I was certain that I would not be able to handle the circus scene that I've had before at other dealerships. 
   After all my research, by Wednesday it had come down to three choices. All three trucks were pretty close to what I wanted,so I contacted all three with some inquiries. By this time one had already been sold, and one gave me the impression he didn't care if I wanted to buy his vehicle or not! 
   The last one was Mr. Brad Watson, with Huffines Chevrolet of Lewisville. Brad answered my request for information on my new Silverado (it's a 2002, but it's like new to me), and after speaking with him for just a few minutes, I could tell that this was a man I could relate to. He informed me that there were several others looking at my vehicle, so I needed to come see him pretty quickly. I managed to shuffle a few jobs around and made it to Lewisville at around lunch time.
   Boy, am I glad I did! The truck was everything I wanted and then some! Then I thought, ""here comes the hard part of trying to get it for what I had in the bank!"" It was the part that, in the past, had always been very frustrating to me. I'm not very good at haggling, and I really hate it when the advertised price does not include everything. I felt pressured to buy and squeezed for every nichol I had!
   But that afternoon, Brad Watson actually changed my opinion of car salesmen. Of course we talked about the truck, but we also talked about a lot of other things too.
I felt very comfortable in our conversations.
 Brad didn't push, pull or give me the run around. He took the amount I told him I had to spend, went to his manager, and in less than 5 minutes came back to tell me that we had a deal!!! 
   I was shocked! This was too good to be true! I had actually had a pleasant car buying experience!!! 
   We walked across to the main showroom, where Brad asked me to have a seat and he would start having the contract drawn up. Instant red flag! I had been there before... stuck in the waiting room, for what seemed like an eternity. I told him that I really needed to get back to the jobs I had left hanging, and if this was going to take very long I'd have to come back later.
   He asked me to give him 5 minutes to see what he could do. In less than that time, he had me sitting with a pen in my hand signing the final paperwork for my Silverado! Shocked again!!! 
   I'm telling you, the next vehicle I purchase will be from Mr. Brad Watson at Huffines Chevrolet of Lewisville. So far, my friends and relatives have heard as much or more about the service and customer relations of Huffines Chevrolet as they have about my truck! I'm still in shock!!!

We purchased our vehicle on Saturday, October 15th, but asked that the check NOT be processed until the following Saturday, the day we were going to actually pick up the vechicle, because it had some minor items that needed repair. The man whom we spoke with must not have understood, because English was NOT his native language, or he forgot because our check was processed before we received ownership of the vehicle.

    After seeing the vehicle I was shopping for on cars.com, I called the dealership and talked with Oscar. Our conversation put me at ease with considering a used vehicle purchase 'sight unseen' from long distance. He assured me if I arrived and saw something I did not like and changed my mind there would be no pressure applied by them. I decided I wanted the vehicle and they held it as sold for 3 days until I could arrive. His description of the vehicle's condition was proven totally accurate once I saw it. He efficiently communicated  by phone, email or text through the entire process prior to my arrival. He even offered to have my wife and I picked up at the airport - We very much appreciate Brad giving us the ride - another example of service above and beyond! Oscar spent ample time covering vehicle inspection,test drive and setting up Navigation and On-Star. Brad and all involved were efficient in finalizing the purchase. When there was not an owner's manuel in vehicle, Brad and Oscar assured me they would have one sent immediately.
    My vehicle is relatively new - 2011 with low milage - but it is still a 'used car'. However, in all my dealings with Huffines I was treated like a 'new car' buyer! Everyone I encountered, from the first phone call to driving off, was friendly and professional!

I live in Temple TX which is a good distance from your dealership. After speaking with Oscar, we felt like this would be the place to purchase the vehicle. Most of the times you purchase a vehicle after you leave the dealership, you question the deal that you received and wonder if you could have made a better deal somewhere else. I feel that Oscar was straight from the beginning and did have a good feeling about my purchase on the long drive home. I still feel good about the purchase. The one thing I feel this dealership could use, is PR products for the customers. You know some hats, keychains or something of that sort. I understand that this dealership is renovating, but customers still would like to have a momento of the dealership that they purchased their vehicle from and do a little advertising since they had a great experience. I want to thank Oscar because I appreciate everything that he did. I was in and out of there really quick. The drive took longer than the purchase.

Eric knew what he could do on the price and there wasn't none of this, ""let me check with my boss"" when I made an offer.  After the deal was made, we felt that Eric went out of his way to get the paper work process started and over with as quickly as possible.  We sure appreciated this with 2 tired and cranky kids.

I told him what i had been going through and we had a great talk about my needs and wants. Oscar really listened to me instead over interupting me and running all over me with his words like other car dealers. Just talking to him on a personal level was very pleasent. Everything he showed me was exactly what i was telling him i was needing. His bright positive additude was so very appreciated. After telling him about a truck i had seen online he took me straight to it and started telling me all about it. i fell in love with it. We went in started the paper work all along chatting nad having a good 'ol time. Being excited about finding and getting exactly want i wanted. It should be a happy time. and for the fisrt time ever it really was. If only all car dealers where like oscar everyone would love going out to shop for a new car. After getting everything financed i took the truck home to return the next day and he helped me take my rental back. to my surprise oscar went a step farther and had gotten me a better interest rate that next morning. It was by far THE best and funnest  car buying experience i have ever had. i will be sending all of my car hunting friends straight to his desk. and im sure i will be back. thank you oscar for being the best. brought a real good thing out of a bad situation for me. huffines... thanks for having such a great dealer.

665,"August 02, 2011","Huffine's Chevrolet of Lewisville service department truly treats their customers with respect.  This past month my daughter's Chevrolet Aveo needed servicing for unexpected mechanical problems.  The moment we met with Matthew Collins, he reassured us that he would do everything possible to help us out.  Matthew is committed to his customers and explains each step of the repair process.  I was impressed how he took time on his day off, to show us himself what we needed repaired.  He had been in the service department checking on other customer's cars when we were dropping the car off, he could have let another representative take our information.  Although, he chose to come over and reassure us.  I was quite impressed with his dedication to customer service.  

Without a doubt if you need a quality service department, you should consider Huffines Chevrolet.  All the service representatives are helpful and understanding to customers.       ",5.0

I met and had great conversations with Allen Moore(professionaly reassured me that my recall was ok), Steven Saracino and Byron Albright. Matthew and Allen assisted me with getting a good price for my window tint and making all the arrangements w/o seeming bothered with my extra request. Matthew even gave me directions to the Post Ofc. and how to navigate the back way out of the dealership. My new Cruze needs better detailing and Matthew is making sure that Mr. Huffines customers are satisfied even if the auto was purchased at another Huffines dealer. Way to go Matthew:)!  My day started extra good because my visit to the service left me with a smile on my face and good cheer. Customers appreciate interactions with upbeat professionals...Our Heavenly Creator smiles at them too. Bless you all...shalom/ckfranklin

667,"July 13, 2011"," I moved to Lewisville 2 years ago.  I was having problems with the a/c on my Saturn.  I had been quoted another price which was quite high from another repair shop. I went to Huffines and had the pleasure of meeting Byron Albright.  He called me back with a significantly lower price.  Since then I have hd my oil changes and tire rotations and other repairs.  Byron is always friendly and helpful.  Well once again my a/c gave me a problem and he got the job done and at a very fair price.  As a Saturn owner I am extremely happy with the service at Huffines.  Everyone is friendlt and helpful.  I miss my Saturn Dealership which was no more in Georgia, but I once again feel at home.  I would reccomend anyone to go here.   ",5.0
668,"July 04, 2011","The service I have received over the past several years at Huffines Chevrolet-Lewisville TX has been outstanding and the care taken to diagnose and repair only what is necessary keeps me coming back.
When I took my car in to have several parts replaced on my last visit, (all at my request) many of my original part numbers had been superseded more than once.
After quite a bit of tracking down part numbers myself, I was pleased to confirm everything they had come up with on parts were correct for my 2000 Trans Am WS6 .

The service team finished the repairs and installation of the new parts a few hours ahead of the requested pick up time(which was a couple days away when I dropped off my car)and the initial estimate was very accurate considering a long list of repairs and parts I requested.

The staff has always been friendly and ready to answer any questions.

I'll have to give the Service Team 5 stars *****
and for my Service Consultant Brian O'Connor;
I'll give Brian a rating of...Service Wizard:)

Thanks guys!

670,"June 29, 2011","Huffines Chevrolet is a great place to buy a new or used car and is a respectable dealership. Before I bought my second vehicle from Huffines Chevrolet I visited two Nissan dealerships whose overall experience fell far short of my two experiences at Huffines. Huffines actually has a professional staff and will work with you, not against you. My salesman Medhane (""MG"") was great, very professional, personable, and courteous.",5.0

675,"June 18, 2011","Oscar worked with me over the phone to accommodate my schedule. When he found that I had been approved for the used suv I wanted he was informed it had been sold. He worked with finance to get me approved for a new suv, for the payment I needed, with no money down. He was also able to get my 6 year old suv paid off, to which I owed $4,000. 
He assured me that the deal was ""done"" and all I needed to Was come in
And sign the paper work. 
I was skeptical of the already ""done"" deal, but I made the hour drive to the dealership. 
Upon arrival, Oscar was with customers, but immediately passed me on to another sales person so I would not need to wait. After a test drive, we began to pull paperwork. As Oscar stated, the deal was comPorte and there were no surprise down
Payment or major changes to the payment. I traded in my 2005 Santa Fe for a 2011 Equinox LTZ. 
A very good experience.",4.8
676,"June 17, 2011","My Dad and I had a great experience purchasing a used Equinox from Huffines with Oscar's help.  They gave us a fair trade in price for my car, worked with us on the price of the vehicle, and made small but necessary repairs to the car such as replacing a torn leather seat and buffing out some small scrapes.  I would recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a used vehicle.",5.0
677,"June 10, 2011","The whole process from start to finish was flawless, everything that was promised was delivered and the used car department, especially Oscar was amazing.

680,"June 05, 2011","Jeremy was courteous, helpful, sincere & apologetic when it took some time to wait for my turn in financing.  He was helpful when I had to bring the car back for a problem a couple of days later - tried to get it fixed but a part had to be ordered.
Elliott was very informative regarding financing, he also discussed an extended service contract without pressuring me about it (I got it).
My overall experience was excellent - everyone I spoke yo was courteous & helpful.  I would come here again if I were in the market for a new car & would recommend Jeremy to anyone looking for a new Chevrolet.",5.0

682,"June 01, 2011","I was in a car accident 5/14/11 & my car was totalled. Because of Texas state law, if your car is totalled, and you have a rental car being paid for by the person responsible for the accident, you have 2-3days to return the rental. therefore, I was without transportation for a little over a week and a half. I called Mr Hallman, explained my situation, and he was able to get me approved in record time and no ""fluff"" in the deal :). Mr Hallman and Moe & Ken went above & beyond the call of duty and I appreciate everything they did to get me into my new (used) car. 
I would highly recommend this dealership to anyone that is looking for outstanding customer service. Thank you!",4.8
683,"May 23, 2011","My last experience was with Byron Albright in the Service Department. I found out that he is a STINKING LIAR. He told me the repair would take about 3 hours and about an hour later he found me and said the repairs were done!
What in the world was he thinking? Under promise and over deliver, how dare he!
Both times I have had reason to go to Huffines have been positive experiences.
I told the service manager he has some nerve hiring someone like Byron.
This type of treatment is not what you would expect these days when we get accustomed to being lied to.

684,"April 21, 2011",I would highly recommend Huffines for a used auto.  My sales person David Rumple was  excellent.  He answered all my questions and was very polite and courteous to us.  When I told him what I wanted he was very willing to show us everything about the car.  David suggested we take a test drive.  We did and was very pleased with the car.  Then we began negotiations and David was very receptive to us.  I also traded in another car and was pleased with the price.  I would highly recommend David to anyone who wants to purchase a used car.  ,4.0
685,"April 07, 2011","Wow...in all the years (30) that I've had to use auto service departments..including this one several times...Mike McLarty was the best service manager that I have ever worked with.  He listened and took the time to understand what I was going through with this car. He followed up daily with updates on what was going on and provided me with superior guidance.  Mike was extremely thorough and knowledgeable.  What a pleasure it was to work with someone that understands service, integrity, and hospitality. It's rare to find that these days.  I've already referred my son to call Mike with an issue that he is having with his car.  It is really great to finally have a service manager that I can trust.

687,"March 26, 2011",Was looking for a used truck and found a 2007 Chevrolet Silverado on the Huffines internet site. Went to dealership and met Dennis Goss which was his first day working at Huffines. Dennis was so helpful and let me test drive the truck. I told him I had to go to one other dealership because I told another salesperson that I would come see her. I went to the other dealership and then went back and bought the truck from Dennis. The truck has be very reliable and am very satisfied with my experience with Huffines and working with Dennis.,5.0

689,"March 19, 2011","We purchased a new 2010 Chevy Tahoe that was a manager's demo and a leftover 2010 model.  We purchased it in Feb. 2011.  Our experience was one of the best I've ever had at a car dealership.  The customer service was second to none.  We actually attempted to buy a 2011 Tahoe at another dealership (Stonebriar) before buying at Huffines and our experience at the other dealership was very bad.  We could tell the other dealership was not being completely honest with us and their prices were nowhere near what we got at Huffines.  Everyone at Huffines, from sales to management to parts & service, were very nice and accomodating to all our needs.  Our salesman worked with us and we managed to get the montly payment we wanted while also taking advantage of GM's no interest financing.  Once we got the vehicle home, we noticed a few minor problems.  We contacted Huffines and were told to bring in the vehicle and they fixed all the small problems immediately without hesitation or questions.  In addition, they gave us our first oil change and tire rotation free as well as a free car wash.  That may sound like a small thing but I was very impressed with their care and service.  No question Huffines will be the place I go first when purchasing a new car in the future.  The dealership looks small but they were the best we found in north Texas.",5.0
