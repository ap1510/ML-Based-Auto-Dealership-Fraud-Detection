0,"January 23, 2020",I purchased a 2014 mazda miatta mx-5  with 9200 miles on it in April 2019. I was told it had been completely serviced and its basically a brand new car.  I was also told it was owned by a doctor in Andrews and was extremely well taken care of.  The first incident happened in about July the check engine light came on so i took it in.  They took it over to Midland since that was warranty work.  i got it back 2 months later.  The only reason i got it back is because i contacted the mazda dealership directly.  Then October was the first major incident was in october the input housing was destroyed.  It was in the shop with a local repair shop in Andrews.  The mechanic told us it had been driven hard.  That was $4000.00.  It was out of the shop less that a week and the gears would grind going down the road.  The mechanic said its something either in the transmission or the tail end.  Not sure how many other thousands of dollars this is going to cost me this time.  I actually pulled the car fax on the car and i am the 4th owner of this car and Benny Boyd has taken it in twice on a trade in.  They lied from the beginning and will probably have to chalk this up as a learning experience.  If i could give them negative stars i would.,1.0
1,"July 25, 2019","Lied to, repeatadly. Worst service department I've ever been to. Kept putting me off on my truck being ready, I guess they had to collaborate their stories since they knew they were caught

2,"January 31, 2019","The salesman Aaron contacted us quickly by phone and was very professional. We made them an offer on a vehicle with shipping to Las Vegas, NV included and they accepted. We asked for a purchase order with what was agreed upon and then we'd wire transfer them the money. 
We waited and never saw a purchase order. We called them multiple times in an attempt to GIVE THEM MONEY! After SIX CONSECUTIVE DAYS of calling, texting, and emailing them, the sales manager Jared kept stringing us along saying he was going to send us a purchase order. We never saw one. On the sixth day, we finally got a hold of the General sales manager Matt and he informed us that it's their policy not to ship vehicles and they were backing out of the deal. After wasting a week of our time they all of a sudden don't ship vehicles. We even went through the process of finalizing an auto loan w/ SunTrust because of the deal we made. Soooo frustrating!!!",1.8

4,"October 27, 2018","I purchasable 2016 Ram Long Horn in 2016. I was upside down on thevehicle being traded in. I talked with the salesman and financial officer to get this corrected on my new purchase, they both assured me with a larger down payment I would avoid a repeat situation. 
That was all lies!! I just tried to trade in the 2016 Ram for a new 1018. The salesman just informed me I am upside down AGAIN!!!!
I asked to have someone in management to contact me about this, but to date no one had....BIG SURPRISE!!!
I will never buy or recommend this “Dealership”",1.5
5,"June 13, 2018","Absolutely without a doubt the worst experience I've ever had with a vehicle purchase. Delivered a 2016 Tundra from Andrews to Big Spring with a wheel cap missing.  They said it fell off on the way over.  Had me go over paperwork in a blowing sand storm outside and when I get the truck home I discover one lug nut missing from each tire (wheel lock system taken off) AND a dime size hole in tail light..which can not pass inspection in Tx.  I purchased the vehicle May 8th and received my tags June 9th.  Still have not received the paperwork I signed.  After multiple attempts to have the tail light replaced...I called sales manager and he tells me I have to drive to Andrews to let them ""look"" at it (second time of driving 63 miles over there). They did not even inspect this truck before selling it to me in my opinion...because all this would not be happening.  They are unsafe..unprofessional..and I am disgusted with their service PERIOD! I did not deserve this kind of treatment and I should've went through Toyota of Midland for purchase. Huge mistake!!!",1.0
6,"October 04, 2017",Went in to get my vehicle calibrated and instead of telling me they could not get it exactly at the beginning they waited to tell me after I paid them that they couldn't fix it and still made me pay full price for something they didn't fix and made me wait over 3 hours. ,1.0
7,"August 11, 2017","I brought my car in for mechanical issues. I brought my car in on a Monday, there was a wait so they did not get to it until that Thursday. They supposedly worked on it the whole time to the next Monday where they tell me i have contaminated fuel and it would over $1000 to drain the tank. Ridiculous. I tell them that I will just take the car somewhere else. I'm a 20 year old college students whose family is all out of state. Super felt like I was being taken advantage of since I stressed that I needed my car back. They still charged me over $300 for a diagnostic fee, when they took 4 days just to tell me it was the fuel. The mechanic I took it to took 1 day to clean the tank and fix a cylinder. Horrible service.",1.8

17,"April 05, 2016","Really Friendly staff, especially since I arrived to the dealership few minutes before closing time. At that time I've been searching for a new vehicle for a couple of months now. When I arrived at the dealership I had no attentions to leave with a car especially since I was a first time buyer. Alexander went over the car details and prices even afford me to test drive the car. He was super friendly about everything, answered any questions I was concern about. I didn't feel like I was pressured into buying from them. For being a first time buyer, it was an overall great service. ",5.0
18,"April 04, 2016",Super friendly staff!! We wanted to test drive a vehicle and they gave us the keys to go by ourselves unlike most dealers that want to ride with you and make you feel like thieves!

30,"January 23, 2016","With no care in the world this gentlemen mistreated us and disrespect me as a women what kind of a manger is he ? With a one year baby near by that shows how no education he has and I respond to his aggressions as polite as I could but bieng a one year near by he should have had more class and let us know in a friendly manner watever the situation was, who would want to deal with someone that has no consideration to children and we were customers that had questions not sure why he has this job if he has no patience no good customer service and gives no care the way he talks in front of children.
