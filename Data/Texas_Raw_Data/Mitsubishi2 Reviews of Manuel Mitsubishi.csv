0,"January 17, 2012","Went in to get car checked for service engine light and trouble starting. Appointment was for 1 pm. Turns out that they only have ONE mechanic who can work on Mitsubishi's and he was M.I.A. until a little after 4 pm. During this wait we tried to call and complain to the manager of the Service Department, whom could also not be reached. Then we went to talk to a ""sales"" rep about getting a vehicle to drive home until ours got fixed. They said that they would let us borrow one until ours was fixed. The car they brought around was bone dry on gas and ALL 4 tires were low on tire pressure by 10 points or more. We went to tell them that the car was not suitable to drive off in the condition that they gave it to us and the rep did not care or apologize. Then I asked to speak with a manager, Jared Franklin, and explained what was wrong with the car to him. He did not care and got an attitude with us saying ""you can take the car or just leave it and be stuck here."" I told him to drop the attitude and he jumped at me for a moment as if he was going to try and punch me. Later, they did air up the tires and give us HALF a tank of gas. The entire process was rude and met with no understanding, compassion, and a general sense of disregard for customer service. If you are looking for a car or wanting to get some service done on your Mitsubishi, DO NOT GO TO MANUEL MITSUBISHI. Save your self the headache and cash and go elsewhere.",1.5
1,"December 02, 2009","Brought car in for transmission issue.
Attempt #1 - they replace transmission ""solenoids"". driving home after the repair the check engine light appears again with the same error code. 
Attempt #2 - Check again and the dealer replaced the transmission computer - charging me AGAIN with the same result - same original check engine code.

After paying over 900 for the first repair and 500 on the second visit the computer STILL has the same error code.
Lesson - They apparently don't know how to diagnose a mits transmission.",2.2
