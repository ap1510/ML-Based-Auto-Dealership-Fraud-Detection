35,"March 13, 2020","I've had really bad experiences with big dealerships in the past, but Chevy Stonebriar was different. In September, Chris (last name?) sold me a 2017 Chevy Volt and he didn't waste the whole ""car salesman"" attitude on me. I didn't feel like I was being tricked or scammed. I came in, told him what car I wanted to look at, and settled on a good price through USAA's estimate. Easy! Just brought it in today, 6 months later for an oil change and Mike in service took care of everything, including a complimentary car wash! The price was fair and although I needed another service besides the oil change, he did not try to push me into having it done before we were financially prepared. Great all around! ",5.0

40,"February 26, 2020","Would give 4.5 stars if I could but not able to do so. All service reps are very respectful to customers and do their best to facilitate timely and quality repairs for their customers. 

I should also say that all GM dealerships are subject to GM Corporate problems stemming from labor strikes last year which is slowing the manufacturing of replacement parts and slowing down repair work. ",4.0

80,"September 06, 2019","When I personally expressed my displeasure(s) directly to Stonebriar Chevrolet's Service Director (you can look-up his name yourself), he informed me that because my ""classic"" Corvette is not valued at $100K, nor under warranty, I did not receive ""priority service"" for the 2 1/2 weeks that it was in their Service Department. I am now acutely aware that I have been bringing my car to the WRONG dealership for service. I will NOT make this mistake again! And, if I may add....my Corvette Club co-members will be informed of my inferior experience(s).

Also, in addition to the exorbitant amount of time that they possessed my Corvette, (regardless of me having to furnish them with a part, 2 1/2 weeks is unacceptable by any stretch of the imagination) when it was finally returned to me: 1. Not all of my requested work had been completed within the timeframe. 2. An unknown cable was hanging-down in front of my gas/brake pedal and when I asked, nobody could/would tell me what it was. 3. The panel underneath my steering column, (where work was done) was left loose, with only one, of two, screws engaged. 4. My custom-installed manual antenna switch was nowhere to be found. When I told the Service Director that it was missing, he informed me that it had not been there when I left them my car and that I should return my car to the original ""installation shop"" for re-evaluation. Upon my further insistence, the car was taken back into the dealership's shop area, re-evaluated, and the switch ""mysteriously"" re-appeared under my dash and the panel (second screw) had been firmly attached. 4. While driving my car home, I noticed that my hood was rattling. When I arrived home, I found that the hood had not been fully closed when the car was returned to me.  

Mind you....this is ALL after having my car in their Service Department for 2 1/2 weeks. Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy....with minimal attention to detail!

At this point, I do NOT need some ""canned"" PC response from Stonebriar Chevrolet Management, saying that they are sorry for their shoddy workmanship, that they can do better, and/or for them to furnish me with a phone number to call them to further discuss my displeasure with their Service Operations. I have already discussed this at a ""Director"" level with them, and there was no misunderstanding regarding my sentiments of dissatisfaction. The reason for my review herein, is so that just in case my grievances did not make it beyond the Director-level, somebody at Stonebriar Chevrolet can read about my (and others') poor experience(s) in a public forum and possibly come to the realization that they are losing customers, (i.e. $$$) due to the atmosphere and aura of dysfunction that permeates their Service Department.

Maybe Warren Buffet's Management Team should take a closer look at the type of management and service that his Berkshire Hathaway Automotive group is dishing-out to Chevrolet customers in N Texas. For a ""small"" fee, I would be happy to give them an earful....",1.2

86,"August 22, 2019","Let me just start off by saying thank you to Stonebriar Chevrolet and the man for making all this possible, John cutler. Your work and motivation to make this deal happen does not go unnoticed. I appreciate everything you have done for me from the get go. When I first walked up to the car John was there with the keys ready to let me take it for a spin. once we got done with the test drive we started right on the paper work to make this deal final. I may not have gotten the car the day I went in there but good things happen to those who wait. Once I got the call to come pick up the car he had it detailed and full of gas ready for me to go. If anyone has any hesitation on purchasing a vehicle from Stonebriar Chevrolet I would ignore it and give them a call.

95,"August 03, 2019","My son and I went to Stonebriar Chevrolet to look at a 2013 Chevrolet Silverado they had advertised on the internet. Upon arrival at the dealership our sales person said the advertised price did not include almost $1000 in “dealer added extras” like window tint, wheel locks, etc. We told the sales person and the sales manager we did not want the “extras” and asked they be removed except for the window tint which was “already done”.   
We bought the vehicle with an added cost of $395 for the window tint. 
The next day my son called to let me know we had been snookered!  Upon closer examination it was clear the window tint was not a “dealer added extra”.  The vehicle had already had the windows tinted which was made obvious by the many small scratches and dings in the tint from the seat belt buckle hitting the window by the previous owner!  So, buyer beware at Stonebriar Chevrolet when you are told the advertised price of a used vehicle does not include ”dealer added extras”.  ",1.0
96,"August 01, 2019","The service manager met me promptly. Confirmed the reason for my service appointment. He then checked the vehicle computer for any messages.

My check engine light came on immediately, the clock on my navigation system went blank, and all the presets on the radio went away.  I called my insurance company and met the adjuster at Stonebriar Chevrolet a few days later.  
The service rep at Stonebriar was Ryan McCarthy.  He took over the situation and provided superior customer service.  He has worked with the insurance company to make sure every problem with my Tahoe was fixed.  He kept me informed all through the repair, which is taking a few weeks to complete.  Ryan has provided the quality of customer service that Stonebriar Chevrolet can be proud of.  I guarantee that when I need a new Chevy, I will be purchasing it from a Stonebriar Chevrolet.  ",5.0

She greeted me with a smile and you could tell how much she cared about her job and making sure she got my problem taken care.

132,"February 22, 2019","Just purchased a new vehicle on Valentine’s Day, and Robert Stevenson was great beginning to end.  He spent time with me on 2 different occasions talking about car buying in general and the features/advantages of different ""classes"" of cars before I ever settled down on what I wanted.  Came in on his day off to meet with us the 2nd time, and stayed until almost 11 pm the evening of purchase to get everything set up and explained to us.

Totally pleased with my new car -- we keep them a long time and wanted to make sure that what we got met all our needs. Robert was great at explaining all the new bells and whistles, demonstrated most of them during our test drive, and then worked with us to make sure we got just what we wanted.

The only hiccup in the whole shebang was that On-Star would not connect for the Welcome Call the night we purchased -- we tried about 6 different times over 45 minutes, and finally at 10:45 pm, we gave up and said we would come back to the dealership the next day to get it done. Robert kept apologizing that they weren't picking up, but we assured him that we knew it wasn't him or the dealership, and that he had no control over the On-Star folks.  The next day on the Welcome Call, the On-Star person didn't really seem to be surprised or concerned that we couldn't connect the day before. They also charged my credit card the next day for an On-Star Data Plan, even though I was supposed to have a 3-month free trial.  I've called the phone number listed on my credit card statement, but it's the AT&T people, and they don't even see the charge on their system, and I keep running around in circles trying to get this resolved. It has made me seriously question whether I really want to continue with the On-Star service beyond the free trial period since this has my only exposure to responsiveness and Customer Service (or lack thereof).  However, none of that reflects on Robert Stevenson or Stonebriar Chevrolet.

This review is based totally our our sales experience -- we have not engaged with the Service Department at all.  We've been warned that the Service Department has issues but supposedly, they are ""cleaning house"" and trying to turn the whole thing around. We'll give them a fair chance as service needs come up on the new vehicle.

224,"February 21, 2018","BEWARE of the unethical “Bait and Switch” sales technique used at this dealership! I was a victim of it!! The Internet Sales Manager sent a photo of a truck and the price for THAT truck to me after I signed up with a search service online. I went to the dealership the next day and test drove THAT truck. Since the Internet Sales Manager was not in, another salesperson helped me. After the test drive, I said I’ll take the truck – it was what I wanted and the price was fair. Once we sat down to do the paperwork the salesperson then told me the price would be almost $1000 MORE since they ""forgot to add some options into the price""! WHAT???? They “Bait” me with the photo, test drive and price then “Switch” the price when I say I’ll take the truck! TOTALLY UNETHICAL!! I excused myself for a moment and called my wife who said to RUN from that SCAM DEALERSHIP!! Since my emotions were already involved and I liked the truck I asked if they could do anything about the increase that wasn’t in the original price they quoted to me for THAT truck. The salesperson went to a “Manager” who came down a few hundred. I went ahead and purchased the truck, but felt they ripped me off during the whole process. Once I got home, the process really kicked in! The dealership provided no satisfactory resolution other then to bring the truck in and REMOVE the options. BUT THEN it would NOT be the truck they showed me nor  the one I bought! Per the salesperson, this is a  WARREN BUFFET company owned dealership.  I can only wonder if HE authorized this unethical sales technique. No wonder he’s so rich – SCREW THE COMMON HARD WORKING MAN!! Way to go Warren...mission accomplished!!! The salesperson also lied to me about ""you get two years of FREE oil changes and tire rotations"". WRONG!! I later learned I get TWO OIL CHANGES within the first 24, 000 miles or 2 years....whichever comes first. I like GM products, but this sales channel and experience was AWFUL!",1.3

Until this purchase, I've never had a dealer give me the best deal around on the new vehicle and give me above market value on my trade. I had to haggle a bit, but not as hard as I'm accustomed to.

284,"October 16, 2017","I was in the market for an optioned 1/2 ton truck and had looked at Dodge, Nissan and GMC. I had a very good idea what I wanted in the product. I was struggling to locate it which was further complicated by the fact that I wanted a 2017 because of the discounts, and the inventory had been picked over by the time I was in the market. There’s really four primary factors that I consider when shopping for a new vehicle:
1.	Is the dealer reputable?
2.	Do they have the product I want?
3.	Am I comfortable with the salesman working with me?
4.	Does the price point work for me?

I visited a total of five dealerships. The first place I visited was a GMC dealership near where I live. The truck was perfect, reputable dealership, salesman was good, but I couldn’t get to the price point I was looking for. The second place I visited was a Dodge dealership near me. This dealership also had the product I wanted, but the price point was too high and the salesman made an unforgivable mistake with his customer and I never went back. The third dealership I visited was a Nissan dealership, which I really liked but the product did not meet my needs. The fourth dealership was another Dodge dealership that I really liked, but again the product did not meet my needs. After shopping for new vehicles for about six weeks, I decided to stop by Stonebriar because it is close to my work. Prior to visiting, like with the other four dealerships, I had email dialog with the dealership explaining what I wanted. My first visit I met the salesman, John Frigon, and I pretty much knew this was a guy I could work with. The first truck he showed me was close to what I wanted, but it had off road tires and was blacked out and my wife said it was too “redneck” for her 53 year old conservative husband. I still like that truck. My wife was wrong, but there are a lot of trucks and only one wife. No problem for John. He found another truck at another dealership and sent me the details. It had 100 miles which to me is used, so John went back to work. He sent me three links to three different trucks and when I viewed them, I could see John was really listening and working to understand what I wanted. The first truck on that list is the one I bought, and I couldn’t be happier. I’m satisfied with the price, and the trade in for my 2010 Dodge Ram was $1000 more than the two Dodge dealerships offered me. My experience during the paperwork and financing process was the best I’ve ever had. This is a really big deal because I have had sour experiences in the past with other dealerships during this stage of the sale. Because of that past experience, I was expecting a poor experience here but I was very surprised. Nice work here, Stonebriar. 

Before leaving the dealership in my new truck, John spent around an hour going through every feature of the truck and introducing me to the service department. It was a great experience overall and I am very happy that I didn’t just settle. One more thing – the day I picked up my truck, John was having the blacked out truck with the off road tires prepped for pick up the same day. ",5.0

The professionalism, knowledge, courtesy and patience that Andy exhibited, throughout the whole process, is what made my experience a resounding positive one.

412,"April 05, 2017","Sales Dept: Sadegh was extremely professional, personable and knowledgeable about the GM products he sells. I consider myself a savvy consumer and purchased my Corvette from Stonebriar, even though Reliable Chevrolet had the same car with an identical price tag. My original plan was to purchase from the dealer that offered the best (hard negotiated) price. My decision to buy from Stonebriar was based strictly on the credibility of Sadegh.

Finance Dept: Although the issue was quickly resolved, I was not as impressed with the finance department. The car was a joint purchase with my wife. Our Credit scores were pulled with mine being just a few points lower, although both scores were excellent. This automatically put her name as the Primary borrower on all associated paperwork. (Not cool for a mans ego purchasing a Corvette). It was explained that protocol from the lender was to go with the highest score. After the paperwork was updated to reflect my name as the Primary, we were told both our scores were equal. That was somewhat unsettling.

Summary: Having said that..... I would still Highly recommend Stonebriar Chevrolet to friends and family.",4.3

The dealer did provide me a great deal and agreed to secure the truck for me for about a month after the purchase because I was working out of state, so I gracefully thank them for that.  I would of given the dealer a five star rating, but I am not completely satisfied in how my salesman presented the truck to me day I received it.  The salesman could have taken a little more time to explain in more details the overall truck functionalities that are new to me and could have provided me the owners manuals that come with the truck and the booklet in which to secure them.   I want to sincerely thank Mr. Andy Richardson (New Car Sales Manager) and Brittany Romero (Title Clerk) for providing me excellent customer service and for taking care of title registration since I bought the truck when I was out of state.  Andy and Brittany keep up the good work.",4.6
499,"October 12, 2016","I've been to many a chevy repair shop but this one is top notch. I drove from okc and Dallas on a Friday(at 5 of course) and my car started having engine problems. I knew a breakdown was imminent because the same thing happened in OKC and was supposedly fixed. In OKC however, I did break down in the middle of the highway and got a $500 tow as a result. 

Obviously panicked from being from out of town, I called into Stonebriar Chevrolet and they promised me they would try and look at it but they were swamped that weekend. After showing up at the dealership in a panic with a shaking car, Joe checked everything out and said he would try extremely hard to make sure he took care of me before I had to leave for OKC on Sunday. I wasn't going to hold my breath however before I knew it on Saturday I got a call from Joe telling me everything was fixed and everything was good to go. 

I can definitely attest to how busy they were Friday when I showed up so the fact that they were still able to get me in and taken care of with plenty of time to spare was a complete lifesaver. What could have very well turned into an extremely stressful weekend ended up being completely worry free because of everybody it Stonebriar Chevrolet. This place is the best, and I say that as someone who has been to many of Chevy dealer in OK.

Then I found Stonebriar Chevrolet, what a  breath of fresh air. No shady salesman's here. Fantastic service and great communication. Not my first rodeo when it comes to car buying. I must say that this dealership I would highly recommend.  Their vehicles are clean and look like the photos they post. True story.... I went to a large popular dealership and when I got there the inside of the vehicle was disappointing. They cropped out the undesirable aspects of the vehicle. Example the dash that was so badly cracked it bounced when I drove it and the leather seats that were patched. When I brought this to there attention it took 5 other salesmen including their manager to come up with the brainstorm idea that I could buy some apoxy and glue it down! Needless to say, I left and never returned. Even after receiving an apology email from their dealership I wouldn't ever recommend anyone to that dealership. That dealership knew I was coming to look at that particular vehicle and assured me that the vehicle was in pristine condition for being used. They lied just to get me down to their dealership.  Finding my vehicle at Stonebriar Chevrolet was a blessing and I look forward to doing all future vehicle purchases with them. Ask for VJ in their used car section. Even their finance guy rocked (sorry, I can't remember his name), he matched the extended warranty that I already had lined up, with a much better one. A+ service all around!!!!    -R. Stock",5.0

We test drove several vehicles locally until we found the one that was best fit for my family and Stonebriar had the best price for the exact vehicle we chose.  2015 Traverse 1LT
Michael was a huge help he made sure we got the SUV we wanted for the price we wanted and didn't stop until we were satisfied. 
We flew into Texas and Michael was waiting for us at the airport to pick us up in our brand-new traverse. I drove it back to the dealership for the test drive. In a little over an hour we did all the paperwork and drove right back to Louisiana the same day. We received several rebates and saved thousands of dollars just from doing a little research prior to purchasing.
Michael has been great. He's called several times just to check on pour family and to see how much we love our new SUV. I'm sure whatever vehicle I choose next I will be contacting Michael for his honesty and experience.
If you're interested in purchasing a Chevrolet of any kind I highly recommend you see Michael Owens and get the best service and price hands-down.

Authorized the repairs and when we picked it up had the exact same issues,except now we had a electronic buzz coming thru the radio as well. Took the car back to them and was told that we had additional problems and needed $550  for additional repairs. I picked it up without authorizing any new repairs and brought the car and my receipts to another Chevy dealership in Plano, explained the situation and asked them if they would take a look at it. They agreed and we agreed to a $ 60 diagnosis fee. After 2 days they called and said the car was ready and there was no charge, the service rep was very diplomatic and would not speak badly about the repairs  Stonebriar completed, but would not even take the $60 charge we agreed to saying that we had already paid too much.
I will try to be as diplomatic as they were and not say Stonebriar ripped me off, maybe they were just incompetent. Be careful with these guys.

660,"December 19, 2014","I was looking online for a used suburban, which I found at Stonebriar Chevrolet.  As a busy business owner, my time is valuable.  So, I did my homework and went into the dealership.  I told James (the sales person) which vehicle that I wanted.  We agreed upon a price ($300 less than what was listed on the internet plus they fix the scratch on the dashboard/trim).  To make a long story short.  After we had agreed upon the price and started the paperwork, James comes back to tell me that the cosmetic fix to the dashboard would cost $150 and his sales manager didn't want to pay for it (after we already agreed upon a price and started the paperwork).  A long story short.  I agreed to pay the $75 he asked to get the scratch fixed as I had already invested too much time at the dealership.  I have to make two more vehicle purchases in 2015 and will not even consider Stonebriar.  It is not about the money.  It is about agreeing on the price and then coming back (wasting my valuable time) and trying to get another $150 out of me after an agreement was complete.  Moral of the story, $75 cost the dealership the possibility of 2 additional purchases and winning my business for life (I have to purchase at least 2 vehicles a year for my business).  But now, I am going to tell everyone I know the $75 story and not recommend Stonebriar Chevrolet to anyone.  As a matter of fact, I will go out of my way to share the story.  It is just human nature,  You have to take care of the customer.  A great lesson I will share with my sales team back at my company.  ",2.4

I managed to convince her that we should (bribery may have been involved). We stopped in to see the 2003 Ford Escape & honestly expected to get told we didn't qualify for the loan. Luis said to trust him, they could do it, but first, lets go drive it to make sure we ""absolutely loved it"". We own a 2003 Escape, how much different could it be? It wasn't any different, it was just like the Escape we own & love. We brought our kids with us (ages 3 & 5), so being after 5 pm when we arrived, they were a bit ""wound up"" to say the least. Luis never seemed bothered or put out by our 2 sweet little monsters, lol. He was very patient & would stop & wait while we handled the kids. He told us this would be a long process & boy was it ever. 4 hours in all. He would tell us when he had to step away & make sure to check on us & reassure us he hadn't forgotten about us. He took the time to explain everything step by step. 

 Finally Luis took us over to financing where we got to wait some more, lol. Finally our finance guy, Brian Robinson, came to get us. By this time our children had reached full on crazy mode. As he took us into his small office, I began to feel very bad for him, he seemed so nice & my kids where about to destroy his tidy office. He actually ENJOYED our kids!!! He was extremely nice & patient!! My son has Aspergers Syndrome, so he doesn't warm up to people, let alone touch them. Brian was so nice that my son hugged him!!!

664,"September 17, 2013","I went in to test drive a car last Wednesday after sending in a request on the Internet.  I really did not plan to buy a car that night.  However, the salesman that I worked with, John Frigon was so patient and was not pushy at all.  I had driven a few cars and then he recommended I drive another one.  I loved the one he recommended and ended up buying it.  It has been a while since I have bought an American made car and now because of the assistance I was given by John and the patience he had with me, I am very happy with my decision.  I am hoping the Service is as great as the Sales experience was.     ",4.7
665,"June 06, 2013","So at the start Mike Owens was great, he was a little long winded at time and great at keeping you there but overall I think he tried his best with what he had to deal with. Everything went downhill when we had to deal with Lance Carter “New sales Director” he used unlawful tactics to gain our SSN when it was not needed at this was not a transaction where the dealership helped with financing  and it was not a cash transaction.  Lance stated we must put our SSN on a credit application even though they would not run a credit check per the “Patriot Act” (Note Lance did later deny this statement when I presented him a copy of the patriot act and tried to blame Mike Owens for it) Then Glen Pirtle did email me with a correction and stated it was required by law due to OFAC rules despite me addressing those rules as well when I dropped off the Patriot act. Then when I asked him to provide me in writing with this from the OFAC I was ignored. In my opinion this company uses unlawful tactics to gain personal information so that they can use dealer risk pricing and gain personal information on people. This is a shady practice and speaks volumes of who they are. Note: they are also not in compliance with the privacy act or the risk base pricing rules be careful if you do not want your information out there, as they will use works like it is the law you must give us your SSN to purchase a car, and this is false. In addition to the above our car was delivered dirty with an additional 15 miles on it from when we left it with them after we purchased it. They missed appointments that we made 24 hours in advance with Mike in finance, However Mike Owens stepped up again and went into his office and got our paperwork, the appointment was set for 12:30 all they had to do is take our check and give us a copy of the paperwork this finally happened at 1:00 after we were already late to return to work. Once we signed the deal the night before they treated us like they could care less they even made the statement of we have other people we need to sell cars to we will get to you when we can. I have purchased 3 Chevys’ in the last 2 years two from other dealerships all of them amazing, Stonebriar Chevy in Frisco is the worst experience I have had, I suggest you stay away.",2.6

669,"December 01, 2012","(BODY SHOP) I am new to the N-DFW area and was inadvertently hit by another vehicle back in June 2012. I went to StoneBriar Chevrolet in Frisco thinking ""Hey I have a 2011 Traverse with 10k miles i want this fixed right"". So i went to the dealership and received an estimate not major damage ~$2,000.00 driver side doors need fixed and re-painted. I later called back and scheduled my repair for the next week ~6/8/12. I dropped the vehicle off and used there onsite Enterprise Rental which was handy. I was told the vehicle would be ready in ~1.5 weeks 6/20/12 I waited and waited finally i called and was told that they had an issue getting a part and would be another week this was around ~6/26/12. So i continued to call and wait for the completion of my vehicle all while driving a rental which was being paid for by the other persons insurance company. Finally my vehicle was ready and I was scheduled to pick it up on 7/9/12  a few days before i picked it up the Insurance company paying for the rental called me to see what was going on so I told them I was scheduled to pick it up on 7/9/12 they then stated they would stop the rental reimbursement at End of Business on 7/9/12 which made sense. I arrived to a vehicle that was in the parking lot still with tape on the gas cap and dusty. After looking over the new paint I noticed un-damaged areas that now had over spray from the repair; additionally down the edges of the door there were significant runs that were ugly. I pointed all of this out and the StoneBriar body shop employee stated he'd run it back and see if they could buff it out I told him that this was unacceptable workmanship and asked for them to fix it right. I then asked him if the dealership was going to provide me a loaner car or if they were going to pay to keep me in the rental, he stated they would just work out the rental with Enterprise and not to worry about it. The next day I received a call from the dealership and he told me they could not buff out the runs and they would have to re-paint the doors. Finally two weeks later it was ready to be picked up at this point it looked ok and I was was going to pick my vehicle up regardless. I picked it up dropped off the rental and Enterprise confirmed they were billing the additional two weeks to the dealership body shop and all was good. A week later I received a call from Enterprise manager telling me I needed to call the Insurance company and see why they were not going to pay for the additional two weeks I laughed and told him the insurance company was not going to pay for the dealerships faulty workmanship and the subsequent extended rental charges and that the Stonebriar estimator chose to keep me in the rental and that the body shop estimator stated that he would work it all out with Enterprise. The Enterprise manager said oh yay I remember this ok no worries and hung up the phone. 90 days went by and I received a Credit Card transaction for the unpaid rental charges totaling $412 I was astonished! I immediately called the Enterprise manager back and he said the Stonebriar body shop still had not paid and after 90 days if there is still and outstanding balance the system automatically charges the on file card. I then went to the dealership with all of my documentation and confronted the body shop manager he told me he would take care of it and that they would mail me the check that day. One week later I called the body shop manager and he stated that he was trying to get it approved by the General Manager (WOW) are you kidding me he stated that he was doing his best to plead my case and would call me later. He did call me back a few days later and said that the General Manager finally agreed to pay $378 and would not pay the full $412 something about he would not pay the tax portion or some crap. I said fine I have spent many hours fighting and dealing with this please cut the check and I will come and get the check. I did receive the check for $378. So me spending the time for this review will hopefully cost the dealership my other $34 and time they stole from me. I would not recommend this dealership they seem very un-professional in the way they handle things. There body shop does not perform as you would expect from a factory dealership. ",2.2
670,"November 14, 2012","Absolutely ENDLESS foot dragging and runaround.  I bought a used car from Stonebriar, and regret doing so.  They upsold me on an accessory add-on, and it went from promising I could get my car the very next day, Sunday, then after putting a deposit down this turned into Monday, to Tuesday, to Wednesday, to *your car will be ready tomorrow morning for sure, I promise* to *well actually, it still isn't ready, let me call you when it is ready* at 3PM that next day.  

They categorically lied to me at least 3 times, saying parts were ordered that were not, saying work was being done when it wasn't, and saying it was complete when it wasn't.  This is in addition to promising the moon before having my money, then changing their story entirely once they had my money.  I don't know the actual story behind what was really happening, but I do know BS and don't like being lied to.  Avoid Stonebriar if at all possible, the only reason I went through with it is was I lost my deposit receipt and as bad as they were, didn't want to eat a loss that big to go deal with a better car dealer.",2.0

673,"June 05, 2012","Tried to trick me into a car I did not want. Weren't able to locate vehicle I was looking for and tried to sell me one off their lot by telling me I could take that one home over night, but also wanted my trade vehicle plus keys. Supposedly they already had a buyer. Same thing happened to me at Eldorado Motors in McKinney.
Shady finance manager too. Abundance of paper work makes you loose track of what you actually sign and buy.
Went to buy from Huffines instead. They had two forms for me to sign that was IT.
When got a check from them for the balance of my trade value versus what I put down on the new vehicle. Getting ready to buy my third new vehicle from Huffines.

There was no high pressure, which I found extremely refreshing. We have bought several new cars over the years, but this was by far the best experience we have ever had. James made us feel very comfortable and appreciated. I have told all of my friends about this great experience, and tell them to go see him if they need a new car!

678,"October 29, 2011","My wife and I have been looking for a new car for about six months.  Couldn't decide on the make or type but never had a sales person patient enough to work with us until I stopped by Stonbriar and met James Trottier.  James understood and made every effort to help me identify the car that met our needs.  I was impressed enough I called my wife and suggested she drive 40 miles to Stonbriar from home and meet James.  We bought a new car the next day.  The entire experience was fantastic.  Even problem resolution was impressive.  There was a glitch with one of the discounts, which James' management team agreed to work with us on so we could take the car home.  This is my second vehicle from a Van Tyle dealership in five years and I can tell you both gave almost the same buying experience.  This last one was the best.

680,"October 07, 2011","I purchase a new 2012 Chevy Sonic from Stonebriar Chevrolet over the internet from California for my daughter who's a college student in Oklahoma. The experience was absolutely problem free and could not have been any better if I was there in person. My sales rep, James Trottier, insured that the vehicle I was looking for, and purchased, was exactly the one I wanted. The total vehicle purchase, including financing was completed in two days, and all done via, internet, e-mails, and over night packages. James also went out of his way to meet with my daughter when she arrived to pick up the car to show her all the new vehicle operations, plus he drove with her to insure that she was absolutely comfortable with driving her new car before leaving the dealership. I would recommend Stonebriar Chevrolet and James Trottier to anyone looking to make a secure, problem free vehicle purchase over the internet.

The back seat that scoots up for storage in back and then moves back to accomodate the legs of the passengers is great!   Everyone I have shown this to is pleasantly surprised.

689,"January 22, 2011","Beware taking your vehicle in for repair.  Our final price was $300 more than what was quoted on the phone. Plus, you are charged $55 per item just to look at the vehicle and it is implied that having repairs done will go towards that amount. Which it does, but just for that particular item. For example, we were still were charged $55 to ""quote"" a cup holder repair that we declined having repaired. The best part was during their ""inspection"" they made a door seal way worse than it was when we brought it in.

I arrived on site as I promised I would, met with the salesman as I promised I would, brought my trade in as I promised I would, and even had my trade in appraised and agreed to the apprasial when after an hour on site the salesman informed me he had ""Good news and Bad news"", the BAD news was they sold the car I drove 6.5 hours to buy, but the GOOD news was that he had others on the lot that were not what I told him I wanted, and even MORE GOOD news was that all of the ones I would have settled for were MORE expensive than the one they promised to sell me. The GOOD news was that they thought they would make MORE MONEY since I drove so far or that they thought I was desperate and had to have one. 
The ONLY GOOD NEWS is that I am not an IDIOT as they assumed I was. This dealer Lied to me, took my valuable time for granted and then tried to screw me over by trying to sell me a more expensive car. They are only in business today due to the good graces of the GENEROUS TAX PAYERS and then treat us like we are the STUPID ones.
