0,"February 02, 2019","I purchased a 2013 Cadillac SRX several years ago & have had multiple problems. I took the vehicle in for regular oil changes & service throughout the warranty period, then used a shop closer to me after it expired. I was told by Sewell each time there was no recall on my vehicle. My transmission has gone out. When I began to research it, I found out this is a known issue for cadillac and many recalls have been issued to correct it. Apparently my vin wasn't one that was recalled. HOWEVER MY FREAKING TRANSMISSION HAS GONE OUT. I was told I would have to pay for diagnostic & repairs. Their service is a scam! There is no way I should be having transmission issues. I would NEVER recommend Sewell.",1.4
1,"May 17, 2018","My wife and I went to Sewell Cadillac looking for a specific vehicle. My wife had a great deal of research on vechicles prior to our visit, and we had several other dealerships to visit. Sewell was our fist stop, and Nick Mitchell greeted us. He was very professional and appreciated the homework my wife had done. ",4.4
2,"May 17, 2018","I recently purchased a vehicle from Sewell... I live in Frisco and used to go to Crest in Plano since they were close. I hadn't even heard of Sewell at the time.... Crest moved to Frisco which made me fell happy but then a friend mentioned how they had purchased several cars from Sewell over the years. 

My lease was ending so I figured why not at least check it out.. It as a completely difference experience.   I came expecting to spend $50k on a new XT5 and left spending low $40's. I thought I needed a premium based on my research but after being thoroughly informed on what the differences were in the vehicles, the salesman ended up saying the luxury trim is what fit my requirements.   Had this salesman just gave me what asked for, I likely would have been just fine.... He stated that he wanted to make sure I understood everything. Having done a lot of research, I felt that I did........ I didn't..... By asking questions about the real things that mattered and explaining what the options are, I moved one trim level down and still received everything that I needed... 

I still feel so confused because I don't feel like I went to a car dealership. A car dealership is supposed to keep up selling you and make as much money as possible. This salesman took his time to listen to me and made sure that I was not spending too much. 

Sadly, I have a problem remembering names and cant recall who my salesman was. All I can recall is that he had several race car pictures on his desk. If you see this review,  thank you and sorry I forgot your name LoL!  

oh and no tricks in finance. I did end up buying the tire and wheel policy and the excess wear.... excess wear is a no brainier and if you like to tap curbs like me, tire and wheel policy is very good option. LoL... ",5.0
3,"May 09, 2018","We just bought or fourth car at Sewell village. Our sales agent, Steve Cauthon, was a sincere representative of a quality dealership. Once we decided on the model and colors Steve went to work finding the car. 
Two days later he had found the car, made it ready And had it ready to go. Everyone at Sewell wants to help you. They even bake cookies every hour. I really enjoyed the technical breakfast session a week later. They went over your car from top to bottom and explained every button. 
Sewell and Steve have my undivided attention. I wouldn't think of going elsewhere to buy a car. ",5.0
4,"April 21, 2018","This is not a car dealership.... this is an experience.... after going to car dealerships for years, I finally landed at Sewell.... let me tell you, this is not like any other car dealership. Its a stress free no push environment.  I never once felt like I was getting the typical BS that dealerships usually give, just telling you what you want to hear to make a sale... I worked wish a salesman named Dustin who was very knowledgeable on the car and went out of his way to make sure I didn't pay too much. He did some researching only to find out that I received special discounts due to where I worked...  I had no idea!!!! no other dealer ever would have went through the extra work to find this!! ",5.0
5,"March 06, 2018","I have been a Sewell customer for 3 years and am blown away by their costumer service. They make every person feel like a VIP . They thrive in making someone feel comfortable and appreciated each time they enter the dealership. The sale associates are so friendly and go above and beyond. The service drive is quick and easy- I’ve never had an issue. They are my Sewell family and I’m proud to be a Sewell member for life.

6,"March 06, 2018","This is the second time I’ve leased a Cadillac from Sewell and I will continue to because of the customer service when I bring my car in for a car wash- a FREE car wash. I’m always greeted so warmly by all of the associates and my sales person, Melanie is always there to check on how I am doing and if I have any questions.
I love the email updates I get to remind me that it’s time for a service and know I will get a smiling face when I come in for service.
I’ll never car shop anywhere else!",5.0
7,"April 26, 2017","Poor sales experience overall. No resolution from Sewell on continued issues with certified preowned Cadillac. Communication was practically non-existent and insulting when I finally get in touch with someone, which only occurred when I went to the dealer in person and waited to speak with someone. Surprisingly, this was my worst car buying experience to date. ",1.2
8,"November 12, 2016","I recently brought a  used vehicle in I had puchased elsewhere. 

The Service Rep made bo comments about condition, other repairs needed or anything. I was referred to Sewell because of it's image of customer service.  I've not yet experienced this great customer service.",2.4
9,"November 06, 2015",After Crest refused to repair my vehicle under a TSB I went to Sewell who repaired it quickly with no issue.  I will always look to Sewell for service or new car purchases in the future.  ,5.0

11,"February 22, 2015","Absolutely piss poor experience with this dealership so far & haven't even received my car.  I spoke with Cathryn which went well.  After making a verbal deal, I spoke with Orlando in F&I & ""thought"" things went well & I was extremely clear when I informed him VERY DIRECTLY--
1) that I only want to finance with Ally
2) I have credit monitoring & ABSOLUTELY DO NOT want my credit pulled by anyone but ALLY
3) ALLY may not be your absolute best rates at the moment but I have a great relationship with them so don't bother with anyone else. 

Well my emails went crazy tonight & apparently my credit was sent to US BANK, WELLS FARGO, GM Financial, COMPASS Bank & finally ALLY.  5 inquiries on 1 bureau & 4 on the other.  Horrible business when someone doesn't even listen well enough to respect my wishes on top of NEVER even calling to ask my permission..  Not 1 call from F&I, only from the salesperson to set up delivery since the financing was finished.  
So with privacy laws we now have & dealing with private information sent AGAINST MY DIRECT ORDER is now forcing me to contact my attorney.. Let's see if Sewell listens to him & has an enjoyable experience when he is done!!",2.0
12,"December 09, 2014","I bought my car 3 weeks ago at a different dealership.  I was unhappy with my former dealership's service after the sale, so I brought my new Cadillac ATS to Sewell to have a door ding removed.  Work done was impeccable, very reasonably priced and I was in and out of there within an hour.  I will DEFINITELY bring my car here for any needed repairs in the future.  Great job, Sewell Cadillac!!!!  ",5.0
13,"November 26, 2014","I fell hook line and sinker for the gorgeous 2013 SRX I bought only to regret it later! After a few months it was falling apart. GM recalls after GM recalls and not a single call from Sewell. I feel unsafe in the vehicle. I am so mad at myself for putting so much money down for this car. This was my third car from Sewell and after this experience, I will not be buying from Sewell ever again. ",2.0
14,"July 13, 2011","Sewell fixed my wifes Cadillacs gas fill problems when Cadillac and the selling dealer said my wife would just have to tolerate the problem. The factory rep. also said it had been corrected on the 2011 model but it could not be corrected on a 2010 model SRX. Took it to Sewell even after they did not sell it, gave me a new CTS to drive and after 5 days called to say it was fixed. Sewell needs to give GM a leson in customer service. Recomendation,  ""they are the best"".",5.0
15,"May 16, 2011","Three times now I have included Sewell Cadillac Dallas on the opportunity to quote repairs on my vehicle. Every time they have been at least 250% higher. I expect a higher markup from the dealership,but their prices are outrageous. My last and final visit to Sewell Cadillac in Dallas, I waited 4 hours for an oil changes and to patch a tire. I was told less than one hour so I decided to wait. I ended up setting in the waiting room 4 hours with no explanation. I will not use this Sewell for any service in the future.",1.8
16,"March 09, 2011","Oh where to start.  I will make a long story short.  I always thought that Sewell was a good name considering all the cars you see in Dallas with that name tag on the back.  This dealership is just another place where scumbag car salesmen gather...they're no better at Sewell as they proclaim.  I went in to buy a 2008 Escalade ESV, met with Tad who was a great guy, and who I felt like tried to help.  Needless to say we worked a deal I drove the car home and realized the whole front end had be rebuilt due to a wreck.  Sewell DID NOT disclose this to me when I bought the car.  They told me it had a clean Carfax and was a local trade from a regular customer.  Upon finding that I called Sewell to see what we could do.  They said they would find me another car, but never did.  The sales manager, Brad Reidel, was a typical used car salesman.  He told me the car had a little paint work done, but that this was nothing ordinary for cars they sell (buyers beware).  They never found me a car, they didn't keep me updated on progress, and it was a battle to nail them down on getting a check to get my down payment back.  It was a month before I was able to give the car back and for them to get me my money back.  I will never in my life buy a car from anyone associated with Sewell.  I also tell everyone I meet/know in Dallas this story to deter them from buying a car from Sewell as well.  ",1.8
17,"November 12, 2005","This dealer does a good job of touting how great they are, but falls way short in delivery.  Sewell just put a band aid on the problem with the air conditioner after repeated times in the shop.  After the warranty expired, and they recommended replacing the system, I had to call Detroit.  They replaced the entire system for free and gave me $2000 off my next Cadillac.  I do not fault GM, but Sewell will never get my business again.  Don't use them, they are crooked.",1.4
