When I came in on yesterday day he knew me and named every vehicle I had bought from him and I do still have all vehicle with no issues. But I wanted to wait until the next day to come back up and buy a vehicle but he told me he would be off work tomorrow and he would set me up to work with another great sale rep and I looked at him strangely and said I couldn’t do that because I would feel like I would be cheating on him. So I went ahead and bought the car that day. As a many cars I like to buy as long as Mr Jeff is employed their this will be the the only dealership I will buy a car from. If you are looking for a salesman that will only give you honesty when buying a vehicle Mr. Jeff is your man. He asked you what you are looking for and he keeps you balanced, calm and focused to make sure you are really buying the right car for you and not to over extend yourself.

My biggest complaint is that I got screwed on the Honda Care Extended warranty. He said he gave  us to coupon 2 coupon(500$ each) to reduce the initial cost to 2500$ (7yr/100000 miles). From there, he lowered to 2310$. We were tired and we accepted it with no frame of reference on pricing.

But what I found out the following day on the internet:
You can get a good frame of reference on Honda Care pricing for all vehicles online at Mcminnville Honda website: mcminnvillehonda.com/por…

mcminnvillehonda.com/por…
Honda Care® - For Your New Odyssey
2019 Honda Odyssey Pricing

6 YRS 100k mi $1,605
7 YRS 100k mi $1,810
8 YRS 100k mi $1,890

Apparently, I  did overpaid on Honda Care and we spent about 5 hours for the entire transaction.

There are service centers out there with good people. There are service centers that go out of their way for you, and then there's Jason Greathouse at Lute Riley Honda. He went way above and beyond what he needed to do for us. Thank you so very much!

My wife had already chosen Lute Riley Honda for all of her service needs. There's no way that is going to change!

Thanks Jason!",5.0

Marc is the fleet salesman. He is a no-nonsense straight shooter. Marc will give you a bottom line price...no dickering. If you feel the need for the back and forth dickering with a salesman, then you need to use someone else. 
It has been an absolute delight to be able to trust Marc AND Lute Riley Honda over the years.
Not just Marc, but the service dept, too. Lute Riley is not the least expensive service in town, but, they will take the time to get it right the first time...my service advisor is Philip Watson. I do not intend to change. I can hardly believe that I'm giving kudos to ANY dealership's service dept...but again, Lute Riley earned it. 
The people in this world, all too often, really suck. That makes it difficult for me to trust ANYBODY. Marc DuPuy has earned my trust. Lute Riley has earned my trust...and that took some doing. I encourage everyone to give Marc DuPuy @ Lute Riley Honda a shot. I guarantee this...you will not regret having tried.
They're not paying me anything and I wouldn't take a dime for telling the truth. You are my guest to tell Marc DuPuy that Jim Crump encouraged you to see him. That right there says it all.

I am so upset that I feel I must share this with everyone I know so they do not get in this situation. Do not buy a car from Lute Riley Honda. After you finance your car and they get the money they forget about you. I have tried to get my Honda Pilot Fixed at least 5 times. The last time I had the Lute Riley Service Department attempt to fix my Pilot. They made me feel as if they were doing me a favor working on my Pilot. WE PURCHASED THE EXTENDED WARRANTY FROM LUTE RILEY. THEY SHOULD FIX IT AND NOT MAKE ME FEEL AS IF I AM BEGGING TO HAVE IT FIXED. They made money off the extended warranty. BTY, my Pilot is still not fixed.

Some of the Problems I am having:

The Infotainment system crashes and freezes. Sometimes it plays Bluetooth from phones not connected to it.

The computer glitches. For example, shows 0 miles when it has a full tank, will not start, when started there is a light show for about five seconds they it starts. It also locked me in the car and would not let me out. I had to hit the manual unlock about 20 times. There is more, basically a gremlin in my electrical system.

When the computer is acting crazy the Pilot runs very rough.

The Gremlin causes the following; intermittently locking me in the car. Computer needing ""rebooted"" car running rough/losing horsepower on acceleration, stereo/Bluetooth not working. Just to name a few.",1.0

382,"April 28, 2018","Visited LR Honda on Tuesday afternoon. Spent 3 hours there visiting with the salesman, test driving the vehicle I was interested in and had my vehicle appraised as a trade-in.  The first part of my visit went well.  Salesman was nice and a good listener. 

Left the dealership with an understanding I was interested in the vehicle.  Needed to confirm my payoff of my vehicle and pursue financing thru my CU.  All of this was communicated to the salesman and sales manager.

I contacted the salesman on Wednesday early afternoon to let him know of my status.  I inquired if he had received my payoff confirmation amount from his sales manager, which I provided to him on Tuesday evening after returning home.  He indicated no he had not.  I told him I was still awaiting approval from my CU.  Not once during this exchange was I told the vehicle had already been sold.

After clearing up some information on my used car loan request I received the approval letter to share with the dealership on Wednesday.  After contacting the salesman to let them know, I was informed the vehicle had been sold Tuesday evening, after I had left the dealership, and was given to sales manager to explain what had occurred.  

I was told they couldn't hold the vehicle, which was not my concern.  I was more upset at the fact that there was no communication between or within the used car sales organization as to if there was any active sales efforts being done on the vehicle? Which I thought would have been me.  And, if in the event it fell through the next interested party would be made aware of it.  This is what I consider good business practice.  

So, if you go to Lute Riley Honda and you are interested in a used vehicle and you can't get it done within their time frame, DON'T BLINK.  It most likely won't be there the next day or maybe I should say later that same day of your visit.  

So, thanks for letting me do all the work I said I was going to do even though you sold it out from under me. Talk about poor customer experience. I will never do business with your dealership and or affiliates.  Plus, I will enjoy telling this story to others.  Good luck in getting their business. 

You get a BIG Thumbs down from me.

387,"February 12, 2018","We recently bought a 2018 Honda Accord Touring Sedan from Lute Riley Honda of Richardson.  Richard Mattes was one of the best car salesman I have ever run across. He was low key, informative, respectful, warm, and gracious.  In addition, he patiently guided us through the entire process in what seemed like record time but at no time did we feel rushed.  
When we were ready to discuss the details of the purchase, the new car sales director, Harrison Lo, was involved by Mr. Mattes.  Mr. Lo provided excellent and timely information and quickly provided a deal that we felt was more than fair but had a very short time limit (by the end of the day). But we wanted a particular body color and seat color that we had seen in the brochure but had not seen in person.  We did not feel comfortable buying without seeing. So Mr. Lo said he would try to get a car on the lot that we could see but he was not sure it could be done in the time frame. We left the dealership thinking that we had probably missed the deal. 
In a few hours we received a call from Mr. Lo with news that he had located a car with our exact specifications.  We went back to the dealership and found that the car was a perfect fit for us.  We signed the deal and drove off that evening with our new car.  
We have had several questions and a couple of visits since then and each time we felt that our satisfaction was a top priority for both Mr. Mattes and Mr. Lo. 
Even the service team at Lute Riley was extremely proactive with resolving our requests. We came back one evening a few minutes after the service hours to have something done.  Mr. Mattes contacted the service team and they actually called a service member to come back into the shop to do the work for us after hours.  This was done with a smile the work was done perfectly.
Kudos to Lute Riley, Mr. Mattes, Mr. Lo, and the Lute Riley service team for putting the customer first!",5.0

389,"November 29, 2017","I was a victim of my own stupidity and a very shady car dealership.  Yes, Lute Riley of Richardson Texas is this shady car dealer.  Approximately 5 years ago, I purchased a CERTIFIED 2010 honda civic.  The vehicle had a dent in the drivers side floor board which should have been a red flag and would have had I been more experienced.  The dealership showed me the car fax that showed no reported accidents.  This report may have been true and correct, at least the reported part. Several days after getting the car home, my battery died.  I brought the car back to Lute Riley who stated that issue was resolved.  A few days after this, the battery died again, I then took it into Huggins Honda of North Richland Hills Texas.  They were in complete disbelief that this car was sold as Certified.  They showed me a birds nest of wiring in the trunk connected to some metal box that they found to be what was shorting our my battery. It appears the previous owner had some type of sound system that was ripped out but not completely.  They also showed my the the front bumper was not connected properly due to much damage to a large plastic piece under the vehicle that normally is used to secure the front bumper and more.  They also showed me that the hood was pushed back towards the windshield an inch or more.  Since purchasing the vehicle, I have had to use coat hangers and plastic tie wraps to hole the front bumper onto the car. Although I mentioned all of this to Lute Riley they did not help in any way until about 3 years after purchase, I had enough of having to continuously add more tie wraps and coat hangers.  I called back and angrily told them I had it and was more than angry.  They told me to bring the car in and they would look at it and see if there was anything that they could do or would do to help.  Initially they noticed the dent at the drivers side floor board and stated that is why everything is loose some one must have hit something and caused damage under the vehicle.  I explained that this was the case when I purchased the vehicle.  He stated that their is no way that was there at purchase and they had pictures of the vehicle. He logged onto his computer and lo and behold his pictures clearly showed the damage to the vehicle was their while they still owned the vehicle.  He stated that he would help in the only way that he could.  He would replace the front bumper if I would pay $300.00 and all should be good.  I payed the $300.00 and he did indeed replace the front bumper but since he didn't fix or replace the plastic under the car and around the wheels that holds the bumper on, I have had to continue to use coat hangers and tie wraps to keep the new bumper on my vehicle.

Please think twice before buying a car from this unscrupulous dealership..  I am sorry that I didn't post this review earlier.  

I hope someone from Honda Motor Corp sees this review",1.4

407,"September 09, 2017","When I started my car search, I wasn't even considering Honda's. After going to a lot of different dealerships, I only decided to try Lute Riley's because it was near a dealership I had just finished visiting. As soon as I got there, I was welcomed by Bruce Prow, and actually got a bit defensive because I was expecting more of the same pushy sales tactics. Either Bruce is a genius, or he's just really good at what he does, because he didn't try to manipulate or push me. Instead, he treated me like a normal human being, answered all my questions (trust me, I had a lot!), and just all around made me feel good about the entire process. I literally took a test drive in one car, changed to a completely different car choice and took another test drive, then asked to take a test drive in the 1st car again, and he never flinched! I had to leave to go back to work that day, but Bruce took my info and followed up with me the right way: he didn't barrage me with annoying texts or keep spamming me. He just let me know that he was there for me if I decided to move forward with a Honda, and he continued answering all my millions of questions now that I was starting to think about an Accord. I went back a few days later and test drove a few more cars, but still didn't pull the plug because I wasn't sure if I could afford the car I wanted. I ended up leaving again, which I thought would've discouraged Bruce, but I was wrong. After I left, he went out of his way to get me a better price so I could afford the exact car I wanted! I ended up going back to Lute Riley a few days later and got my 2017 Accord Coupe. Once I made my decision, I talked to several other Lute Riley representatives, and had a similar, welcoming experience. I wasn't pushed or talked down to, and the finance rep spent a lot of extra time going over my options and explaining how the financials worked. And it didn't stop there - the morning after I got my new car, I noticed a few small scratches in the paint. I texted Bruce, and he took care of it ASAP, no trouble at all. I cannot stress this enough: I WOULD NOT HAVE GOTTEN THIS CAR AT ANY OTHER DEALERSHIP WITH ANY OTHER SALESMAN. I went from not even considering Honda's to getting a brand new one that I'm absolutely in love with, and would not have this car without Bruce's hard work, patience, and perseverance. I really hope you're reading this Bruce, and that you get a promotion :), because you just made me a Lute Riley customer for life!",5.0

When I went to them to pick up the car the engine was already started and I just drive but when I get off from there and stop at my home I realized they killed by battery because I am not able to start my car again.

It took me 8 visits before they finally fixed the brakes. After running a full inspection on the car, I found out that they did not do a brake fluid exchange or a transmission service even though the car was supposed to be due for these before I purchased it.

422,"March 12, 2017","I originally bought a 2011 CRZ in 2012 from a salesman by the name of Ricky Bobby and I could not have been happier with the very fair and affordable deal he had made back then. The car has been incredibly dependable (as hondas usually are) until one day it would not start up and had to have it towed! I mistakenly had the car towed to the nearest dealership (Honda of Rockwall) to have it looked at! While I was there I saw a Honda Civic SI that instantly won my heart as I've always wanted one! Not knowing what was wrong with my car at the time (fearing it was the ima battery which Rockwall told me it was NOT covered under my 8 yr 100k warranty if that what it was) I ended up buying the SI. They reassured me that it was a certified Honda when I asked, as that is all that I buy, but found out the next day that the certified price of $799 was added on top of the sticker  price, when all of my Certified Hondas in past purchases have always been included in that sticker price! Additionally they added  another charge of $1595 for new tires, again which should have been included in that original Certified price! Further, they said I HAD to also buy the tire package (nitro) for another $199 and a windshield protection coverage for another $199!! I did not want either of those services but they told me I didn't have a choice!! The next day when I got a better look at the new purchase in day light I noticed the condition of the vehicle! It was a 2015 civic SI with 36,300 miles. All four rims were badly chewed up with huge chunks taken out in some places, the rear bumper was dull and had obviously been repainted very poorly, there was a hole in the leather casing around the stick shift, and the plastic door jam was broken as someone had obviously stepped on it and broke it! This car was NOT in good condition and definitely did NOT QUALIFY under the Certified Honda condition criteria! I immediately went back to the Rockwall dealership the next day and demanded to reverse the deal! The general sales manager  refused to do so but understood my complaint and adjusted the price about $2000 due to the misrepresentation given, but at that point I hated the car due to the bad deal given overall! The next weekend I took the car to show Ricky Bobby at Lute Riley Honda and he agreed this car did not qualify based on the very fair condition of the car that it never should have been sold as a certified vehicle and that I should go back again as they should make the deal right! I did continue to contact them and finally after a week of fighting with many of them (also getting the owner involved) they finally reversed the deal! But before that, one of the sales guys tried to deter me by telling it WAS the IMA battery! I said I don't care at this point! The next day when I picked up my old car, I went to the guy in servicing ( the guy I gave the keys to have it looked at) He told me it was the REGULAR battery NOT the IMA! Another lie! I got the car home and drove my truck to Lute Riley the following weekend for the purchase of a regular battery! Oh also once the dealership agreed to reverse the deal they put the old/bad battery back in. LOL Anyway I got the new battery installed and have had no issues since! And for the record Lute Riley Honda confirmed that IF it was the IMA battery, it WOULD HAVE BEEN covered! So it has been lie after lie from Honda of Rockwall and Lute Riley helped me out on all levels yet again! Lesson Learned! I will NEVER EVER go to Honda of Rockwall for ANYTHING! And I will only go to Lute Riley Honda from now on! Further, I will only deal with Ricky Bobby as my salesman! I do have to mention other great employees at Lute Riley Honda as well. Jason Greathouse, Juan Rodriguez  and Kanin Castillo in servicing. Jason has confirmed that my IMA battery was actually covered, Juan honored my free rotation coupon that was actually from Honda of Rockwall, and Kanin caught on that I purchased this car at this dealership in 2012 so he looked up my account and found that I never used my free oil change voucher when I first bought the car in 2012, so he honored that as well! So not only did I get wonderful customer service from all of the above Lute Riley employees but all services were done free of charge that day! I will NEVER go anywhere else for my Honda purchases other than LUTE RILEY HONDA!! They truly know how to treat New AND Existing customers! ",5.0

437,"February 06, 2017","I received great help from Mr. Jeff Sowards who assisted me in purchasing a new vehicle from Lute Riley Honda.

Initially, I wanted to only purchase a used car priced around $10K. Jeff diligently searched cars that were right for me for nearly 3 weeks. Jeff would called me a few times a week to inform me the used cars he found that were within my price range, and he would ensure the cars were in good condition and were worth purchasing.

My used car purchase developed from a $10K to $21K. When I visited Jeff yesterday (2/4/17) to inform him about my decision, Jeff was able to work with his manager to find me a new car that closely matched my budget. Jeff let me test drive the car and explained all the features that a CRV had. After I purchased the vehicle, Jeff and his co-worker ensured the car was ready and answered all questions I had. 

I appreciate Jeff's help, professionalism, courtesy, knowledge, and patience. I will not hesitate to purchase another car from him if the opportunity presents itself.",5.0

The inspection had been done but the windshield wipers were the same old shredded ones from before, the A/C and the door locks did not work, there was still no brake light and the front dash glass was broken.  They gave us a legal inspection sticker with the car in this shape. The manager said he would 'make it right'.  Well, my son picks up the car, the oil is over filled so we have to wait for them to drain some out.  So much for going over it 'with a fine tooth comb'. When my son drives it, the steering goes out. It seems this high dollar Rack and Pinion that I had to have before the car could be inspected was bad. Funny we never noticed a problem with the steering before we went to Honda.  I sent a copy of my email to Jason Greathouse, the Manager of the Service Department to Anthony Mena, listed as General Manager (I'm guessing of sales),  and Dan Weiss the General Manager of Honda, guess they are not concerned about future sales because I did not receive so much as a return email.

448,"October 27, 2016","As a woman, shopping for a car can be a sexist nightmare. Seriously, men in this business talk to our husbands like they still run the check books in 2016. News flash guys, women are actually pitching in on financial decisions these days!! 

I went to six different dealerships. A preowned lease place, a chevy dealer and FOUR Honda dealers. Justin at Lute Riley was the first Honda dealership salesman, then one in Garland,  one in Houston (hey I wanted a good deal) and one in Frisco. When we walked into Honda Justin asked who was looking at a new car. Both my husband and I said I was and he walked me through the different versions of the Pilot I was looking at. He didn't emphasize makeup lit mirrors or cup holders because I'm a woman and that's all we could possibly be interested in. (Can you see me rolling my eyes right now and hear my sarcasm?) He actually asked me what I was looking for, what features were important to me and told me which trim leave fit my needs. I left, thinking I could find a better deal. We texted back and forth and I got a little better deal, but was still sure I could find a better one. (My Dad was a car salesman for 30+ years, I don't play) So I shopped around. Feel free to look at my next review of David McDavid Honda in Frisco to learn how that went. 

Anyways, come Monday I'd had my fill of the car sales industry and their typical treatment of women and text Justin to see if my car was still available. It was! Went back in at around 530 pm, Justin stayed late to work with me from start to finish of the process and dealt with me like a person with a brain, not like some dumb woman who needs her husbands input or permission to buy a car. 

He was by far the most respectful man I've ever dealt with in car buying. He gave me a good deal and was upfront with me. He spoke to the person buying the actual car and took the time to find out what I wanted out of my car instead of assuming as a woman I want lit makeup mirrors and extra cup holders. I highly recommend going to see him for your car buying needs.

I should add, I had to bring my car back in to be looked at for a scratch in one of the windows and even then, he had already sold me the car, Justin took care of me. He didn't like that I had to be inconvenienced by bringing it back in so he cleaned my car inside and out and filled my gas tank up.

The sales associate steered me towards a preowned vehicle and had me drive it without telling me what my expected trade in value would be and after a lengthy test drive I was basically told that they could negotiate on the vehicle price, and on top of that gave me a very low trade in value.

But since yesterday I am advising to people to make their own research when buying parts from them. I had the disgusting experience dealing with Roy Arcilla. I asked him for a part number that they did not have in stock and he refused to gave me any information. So I decided to preorder it from them and paid $325.00 for a 02 sensor. I went to my car and decided to check and compare the price paid a minute ago calling a local autopart place but to know also if they had it in stock, and yes, they had it in stock and for less than a quarter of the price!! $33.00 same brand (Denso), same specs and a year of warranty no questions!. I felt like a dumb, for paying in advance an overpriced item offered in 24 hours but also for accepting the rude and prepotent attitude of this salesman!. I went 5 minutes later to cancel my prepaid order and this guy Roy said ""We can't cancel. Come back tomorrow if you want your money"". Since a couple of years I am understanding people that just hate their job so I decided to not argue with this person so I emailed the parts manager explaining the reason of my cancelation and he replied:

""Thanks for contacting us.
I apologize for my staff upsetting you.
When you had our cashier run your card, and then signed the credit card slip, that was the Authorization for the transaction. It was completed at that time. There is not a way to de-authorize a transaction, but we will refund your credit card. We will need the number and the expiration date to do so. We do not keep the entire number in our system, for security reasons.
""I would like to clarify something in relation to this situation. I have instructed my people to not give out part numbers. It is a rule they must follow. I understand that this is sometimes upsetting to people. After talking to Roy, it seems like you originally wanted just the part number. I have used this situation as a learning experience for my staff"". We will handle these types of things differently in the future.
So again, I'm sorry that we did not live up to your expectations. We are making changes to improve and to keep this from happening to someone else. If you want to call me with your credit card number, I can handle the refund myself. If you want to come by, we can handle it that way also. Whatever is easier for you.

972.437.1141""

Now I write: I don't care for paying overpriced items, I paid for them in the past and I will pay for them in the future. I am just advising everybody to make your homework, 33 bucks vs 325? Plus Roy's attitude warning me with a 20% restoking fee for a part that was out of stock, also 20 days for return, only if the part is unused and only if original receipt is presented? I understand that this is a businesses and I don't want nothing for free but at least train your people to cover this scam against your costumers in a better way. All the good reviews here are from people buying cars, (because the brand is good) but good luck in the moment when you are out of warranty and you need to deal with Steven and Roy from parts department of Lute Riley at North Central expressway... None of the Charlie Company vehicles will be here again.

490,"May 20, 2014","My Accord's engine overheated and I decided to have it totally rebuilt.  I took it to Lute Riley and paid them several thousand dollars for the repair, but after several years it has become increasingly obvious that either they didn't do the work and said they did (and this is what my other Honda mechanic tells me is the case) or else they did the rebuild poorly.

Ever since the rebuild, I've gotten poor gas mileage, low power, stumbling/misfiring, and one of the plugs fouls repeatedly.  The first time I took it back, the dealer told me I needed an (expensive) carburetor rebuild... which sounds bogus, because that wouldn't affect just one cylinder.  But I let them do the work,and the car ran (again) sort of okay for about a year, and then I started getting the misfiring/stumbling again.  One of the times I took it back, the mechanic even put on the service report that ""this problem will recur.""  

I took the car back and the dealer had it for MANY months and when I finally went back to pick it up, Lute Riley said they had fixed it, but (again) they basically just put a bandaid on it (and they even took out my battery, which had a warranty, and replaced it with a toy (motorcycle?-) sized battery with no warranty.

I just want my car fixed, properly, the way I PAID THEM TO DO.  I called them about this several months ago and discussed things with the dealer at length, and they promised to get back to me.  Still nothing.

I paid them to fix my car, properly.  I want it fixed right, like I paid them to do.  I don't think I'm being at all unreasonable about that.  The dealer doesn't want to fix my car, and make it right.

The service department at Lute Riley is disreputable, dishonest, and not at all trustworthy.  BEWARE!!!  Don't let them cheat or rip you off the way they did me...!

492,"April 14, 2014","I went into the dealership assuming I would be ripped off. Lets face it, used car sales men don't have the most stellar reputation. My experience has forever changed my impression of the car buying process. I was greated by the sales man Devrim Ersoy. Not only was he incredibly friendly and respectful, but I never once felt pressured. I told him what I was looking for and he gave me two different options based on what I told him. He actually listened to what I wanted and took the time to match me with the perfect product. He didn't push me into the car of the month. He never made me feel rushed, he offered me drinks/snacks, and made the entire process so easy. He explained the process and set proper expectations during the entire purchase. I was treated so respectfully and felt bad for assuming the worst going into the dealership. The entire purchase process was wonderful! Once I had signed paperwork, Devrim took his time explaining all of the features and making sure I was comfortable in my new car. Im so impressed!!",5.0
493,"October 23, 2013","On October 9, 2013, I bought my car in for Service at Luke Riley Honda, Richardson location. I was told over the phone by the service advisor that the problem was my serpentine belt and front left axle, which needed replacing and the rattling noise I heard would stop. After I paid the bill and drove halfway home, I began to hear the same noise I heard before I brought the car in for service.  I turned around drove back to the dealership and told the service advisor working at the time that the problem wasn’t fixed correctly. I had no choice but to leave my car there again overnight. I wasn’t offered a loaner since the rental place had closed for the night per the servicer, he offered to check if any shuttles were available to take me home and it was.  The next day I received a called back from Vincent stating, it was now the under carriage that was damage and they could take it to another shop to get it fixed.  At this point I was very upset and untrusting at the fact, I had just paid $590.95 believing my car was repaired and to find out that the Honda Certified Service Advisor had no clue as to what was wrong with my car. If I did what he suggested this would leave me without a car in which I need to get to work. He offered to speak with his boss to see if he could refund me some of the money since I paid $590.95 for nothing that I came in for. I waited a few days and no called. So I called Vincent early Thursday morning for an update and he said he was with a customer and would call me back. I can understand people get busy from time to time but after a few days went by and still haven’t received that call back Vincent promised when he finished with that customer, I became irritated. The next morning I called at 10:45 asking for the Service Manger, the receptionist forward the call to the Service Director and I left a voicemail message. I thought surely I would get a call back from the Service Director offering me a resolution to my problem, all to find out that’s the way the service department at Luke Riley Honda operates. It upsets me to know I don’t feel comfortable having my car repaired here after service people misled me with what’s really going on with my car. I have yet to receive a return call from the Service Director and it’s been almost a week. I’m very frustrated with the lack of concern this dealership has for their customers. 
I just hope they will do what you can to rectify this situation and reach the level of customer servicer Honda states in their Mission Statement.

500,"April 17, 2013","Bought a new 2013 Honda CR-V from Lute Riley Honda in Richardson, TX last week.  This is my third new CR-V and the second one bought from Lute Riley.   I thought my 2010 had all the features I wanted for the price; however, the 2013 CR-V includes so many new great features it is fantastic; and, at the same low price.  More power, quieter ride, navigation system is satellite rather than CD, backup camera is great, and too many others to list.   

Although I would say that I am definitely sold on the Honda CR-V’s I think the #1 selling point for my purchases is Lute Riley Honda and it’s awesome staff.  I live 300+ miles from Richardson; however, I will continue to travel to Richardson to buy my future CR-V’s.   

Shawn Khan was my Sales Consultant for both of my purchases from Lute Riley.  There is absolutely no sales pressure from Shawn.  He is very knowledgable about all the features of the car and answers all my questions.  Shawn gives me his full attention while I am deciding color, features, etc., that I am looking for and he keeps tract of this information.  He keeps in touch with me every few months to make sure everything is going well with my car and do I have any questions.  Although everyone is very friendly and helpful at Lute Riley I will continue to work with Shawn Khan if possible.  
THANK YOU SHAWN!! 

After I finally decided on which CR-V I wanted it was time for the financial part.  This was unbelievable.  Not only did I get a great trade-in price for my 2010 CR-V trade-in, Brett Rupe, Finance Manager, got my payments down $50/month for the same number of payments.  THANK YOU BRETT.

505,"February 19, 2013","I purchased a 2013 Pilot EX-L from LR Honda last night. This is my 4th Honda, and 2nd time to purchase at Lute Riley (1st time was in 2005). I chose to go back here because not only did they easily beat the 5 previous quotes from John Eagle, David McDavid,Honda Cars of McKinney AND Rusty Wallis by hundreds (not $10, HUNDREDS) they threw in 8 add-ons, 2 years of Free oil changes (yes, YEARS) and the salesman had an ice-cold Sprite waiting for me when I got there (he knew I had a sore throat & cold LOL!) OK, so the Sprite is like, whatever, but to me it showed a sense of humor and caring that you don't see at other dealerships, who act like YOU owe THEM something.   I hate to drop names on reviews, because I am always suspicious that the review is written by the actual sales person trying to make the dealership look good (seriously, you know you have thought it too! haha!) but I will on this one, James Brown was our sales guy and Finance guy was named Bret. Even though it was after 9pm by the time we examined the actual vehicle, James parked it in the brightly lit service department so we could see it good, and he also took the painstaken time to show me every little button, programmed my phone into the bluetooth & etc. I'd test driven roughly 12 cars before this, and NO ONE had taken the time to do any of that, all the OTHER dealerships (*cough, cough, Honda cars of McKinney*) wanted to know was what my monthly payment I was comfortable with, the others could careless to SELL me the actual vehicle. ggrrr....  Bret (finance) was also patient & straight to the point, didn't pressure me with all the Gap Ins crap and etc, he was sympathetic that I was sick and ready to get it over with at that point. They beat our bank's APR of 2.9% and we got 0.9% easy, even with Meh credit scores. Bret seemed even amused at me when I got so excited over the oil changes, and was examining the paperwork for any extras that could have gotten slipped by us. Nope, not there. They seriously rock. I have referred all my friends on Facebook, and hope you don't hesitate to send your daughter/sister/mom there, they are really cool to deal with and don't miscalculate your intellect as a female. *Only a woman will understand what I mean by that, when it comes to buying a car*",5.0

509,"September 10, 2012","Went into the dealership with loan already lined up to look at a 09' Gmc Sierra. Before arriving I had told them this and the numbers I was needing to happen and they said that would be no problem to meet. I went and test drove and sat down and got the numbers where I needed them, I had said ok all I need you to do is fax a purchase order to my bank so that my banker can finalize the loan and get a cashiers check cut. They refused to do that insisting they could close the loan from Chase in the dealership, that would have been fine if the rate and loan was matching the figures I had in the branch at Chase. I went ahead and let them run my credit and see if they could do anything better then the figures Chase was pulling up and they were no where near. I ended up walking that night and I was 30 minutes down the road and Jay called and told me to come back that the managers were gone and they would be able to match what I needed, it was 1030 at night and I said no I had to work early the next day and that if he was saying that I could come after work the next day, he said no it can only be within the next 4 minutes. I said no thanks, I like the truck but there are plenty of other trucks in the market and I can find somebody not so set on pushing finance when I already had the financing I wanted setup for me. The next day on my lunch break Jay calls back and said they would drop the price even more and I said that is fine and all I need you to do is fax a purchase order to Chase, they refused and said I had to be in the dealership, I did not want to drive back over there for a purchase order then have to go to the bank and back to the dealership. They insisted they could still close the loan through Chase at the dealership but the rate still was not matching what I already had at the branch. My banker had called them to and they still insisted they could close it there. They finally faxed the purchase order to the Chase branch at 5 on a Friday and it was wrong, 530 rolls around and the right one comes through. Closing a loan 30 minutes before Chase closed on a Friday was not an option. I was set to close the loan on Saturday morning and let the dealership know and they agreed and said they could not hold the truck. Saturday morning rolls around and I am at the bank closing the loan and Jay calls and asks when I will be there I said in about an hour and he said ok well see you when you get here. 30 Minutes later he calls and says hurry somebody is looking at the truck. Then after I get off the phone I get a text from him saying that I should have had my banker close the loan yesterday like he said. I finish at the bank and arrive at the dealership with the truck sitting in the same spot that I left it in from my test drive. They are telling me that the truck is sold, I ask to speak to a manager and was taken to a manager that was not present any of the times I was in the dealership and had no clue what was going on with my deal. They still insisted that the truck was sold. My banker called the dealership after that and asked for another manager and he hung up on him when they started talking. Then 5 minutes later I am informed that the person looking at the truck might not be interested anybody after I was standing in the lobby yelling at Jay. Then they came out and said that the guy backed out completely. I ended up getting a steal on the truck and am happy with my deal but what was supposed to make it easy on me by having my financing lined up turn into a nightmare.

Dealing with HARRISON just thru phone & text messaging, and he gave me THE BEST price compare to other Honda dealerships within 40 miles of DFW area. Some dealers gave me  lower price just to lure me in. But when I showed up at their door, they jacked the price and did not honor their offers. 

Harrison was busy with a customer when I went in, so he appointed JAVED to show me the car I want. There were 3 different colors of CRV that we were interested in. And they were located in 3 different lots within about 2 miles radius. JAVED patiently took us to all 3 locations to show the car. It took me & my wife about 40 minutes to decide the color we wanted. After that, Javed took us back to main office & complete the paper works with Harrison with the price we agreed upon on the phone (no more haggling & wasting time here). It took him just about 15 minutes to complete this process. Then he sent us to Jeremy in accounting/billing. JEREMY offered me an extended warranty just ONCE, and when I said No Thanks, he immediately proceed processing my payment, and finished in just 10 minutes!

Brian was very courteous and made sure all our questions were answered. After comparing used car prices with new car prices we decided to go with a new Civic. 

We had our financing set up through our credit union which also had fleet pricing available for their members through various dealerships. After obtaining the best price I called Brian and he offered to match my best price.

We went to the dealership and Brian had our black Civic ready for us when we got there. We test drove it and then signed the contract for our pre-arranged price.

I was recently in the market for a fuel efficient vehicle, being that my Ford was killing me on my gas bill. I was attracted to Honda and the incentives they offered, but made a HUGE mistake of going to David McDavid first.
I spend two days and over 14 hours trying to negotiate a fair deal with them, but after hearing a lot of fast talk and trying to see through all the white smoke I walked out. This was the only day I had to finish my car deal so I contacted Mr Zoobie at your internet sales department and told him my story. He assured me that I was not being unreasonable, like David Mc whats his name said, and that if I were to come in your team would be straight forward with me. It was already 8pm and I had a bad taste for Honda in my mouth, but I still packed up my two year old and headed down. Mr Zoobie introduced me to Clint Kargozar, who was professional, courteous, knowledgeable, and delived on every promise he made. He FAR exceeded my expectations, so much so i decided to purchase a second vehicle for my wife while i was there. He was insistant on being detailed and straight forward. I didnt have to ask him to slow down when we were doing math together and even his follow up was AMAZING. This was my first foreign car and my first Honda for that matter and i will never drive anything else, and will not buy a car from anyone else. Clint is MY car guy. He had me in and out making two purchases in 3 and a half hours. He and your team are amazing and you have earned a Lute Riley Honda customer for life. Thank you for having and amazing team and people like Clint on board. It was hands down the BEST car buying experience of my life, and I have told everyone who asks about my brand new CRV where to go and who to see, and where not to go for that matter (David McShady)

519,"April 03, 2012","I bought my first car at Lute Riley. I wont ever go back. I was looking to trade in my original car and decided to stop by since when purchasing the original car, I was told that when they time came, they would buy it back and they would give me whatever was owed on if it that was the case. 

I found a car I liked. Decided to give it a drive. While we were walking up to drive up, another salesperson was showing a family the car. We got in and drove off. After driving around and deciding that this was the car for me, we headed back to the dealership. 

While sitting down to start the negotiations, the other salesperson walked up (Ken) to our sales person and got on to him right behind me about having the car out too long and that we did that so they wouldnt buy it. First, that is super unprofessional. Second, if they wanted to buy the car so bad, they couldve waited and when we returned made the offer. Neither happened but that just set the tone. 

After looking at my car, they came back and gave me an offer well below the blue book average. Having explained to them what they had said previously about buying it back, they said they no longer did that. They then also explained that they would not negotiate on the car price because of the new policy which gives them no flexibility. I told them if they would give what I owed on the car, I would buy the other car at sticker price. They wouldnt do it. It made no sense, especially since I was a returning customer. Oh well. They randomly leave voicemails that just say let us know how we can help. Why would I work with you if you arent willing to negotiate and low ball people on prices.

He was much better than any of the other salesmen we had encountered since looking for a new van.  I wish they would have gone down on the price of the van and given us more for our trade-in.  It was basically their call and no negotiation.  That was the only thing that I was unhappy about.  Our van is very nice and still runs very well.  Thanks guys for helping us out!

560,"September 08, 2011","We were in Lute Riley dealership a couple of weeks ago and bought a new Honda Odyssey Touring Edition with the help of salesman Ke Chen.
 
Let me give you a brief recap of our car buying experience.   We had been looking for over a month and had been to multiple dealerships as my husband wanted me to look at a lot of different cars to make sure I was happy with the kind we picked.   We actually had been to this dealership twice to look at the Odyssey and Pilot.   I won't go any further about those two visits.   We obviously did not meet Ke on those visits.
 
We adopted a baby boy and really needed a new car with more room and decided we would buy by the end of the month.  Saturday, August 27 we set aside the day to shop.  We had our day mapped out and had pretty much narrowed down to the Odyssey EX edition or the Nissan Quest or 2 other cars.   We looked to see who had inventory and Lute Riley had one color we wanted to see.   The last thing my husband said to me as we walked out the door was - ""we will start at Lute Riley JUST to see that color but I do NOT want to do business with Lute Riley - we will head to a Frisco dealership after that"".
 
We arrived on the lot at 12:30  - just to look at color - and left at 5:00 with a brand new car.   Why?  Pretty much 100% because of Ke Chen.    He greeted us at the door and was gracious, knowledgeable, helpful and not pushy or that ""trying to be icky sweet"" salesman that makes you crazy.   My husband is a DETAIL technical organizer personality type and Ke answered ALL of his questions - Ke knew EVERY detail my husband wanted to know.   We had seen 10 salesman before Ke and NOT one was as knowledgeable as Ke was about the Odyssey - my husband was almost speechless as ALL his technical questions were answered!
 
I must say, when Ke asked if we wanted to talk numbers, I was ready for my husband to say no and drag me out of there and just about fainted when he said YES.   Especially since the Touring edition was, as my husband put it, WAY more car than what he intended to buy.
 
Ke sat at his desk with us and discussed the differences in the editions and the pros and cons and before I knew it my husband was looking at numbers for the Touring edition.    Ke, and David, negotiated so graciously with us without any HIGH PRESSURE tactics and much to my surprise and delight we signed the deal and drove off with a rockin' new car!
 
Let me put it this way....some of our VERY dearest friends own a Nissan dealership and always make us a deal......yet we are now proud owners of a Lute Riley Honda!
 
Count your blessings that you have such a wonderful employee.   Ke is an unbelievable asset to your organization and thanks to him, we have forgotten all our car buying horror stories and now can share about our painless wonderful afternoon buying a car from Ke at Lute Riley.
 
If you had told me this scenario that Saturday morning I would have laughed at you.  But thanks to Ke, we are VERY VERY VERY  happy customers and will recommend Ke and Lute Riley to all our friends and family.    
 
We smile every time we get in our new car.   We love it.   We are SO grateful Ke pointed out the pros of the Touring edition and that, thanks to him, we did not settle for the EX edition.    Words cannot even express our delight at our new car.    And then after we signed the papers Ke spent over an hour in the 110 degree heat training us on all the bells and whistles.....that was quite over and above his responsibility but he did it so graciously!   We would have been lost without his training!
 
Ke is THE best and we will be back to buy from him again!   He has changed our opinion of car buying, and Lute Riley, forever.   In our opinion, he's a rock star!

I was shown the 2003 Buick LeSabre by Dan Ashton and brought my wife back to approve and drive.  It's been my experience of 55 years in sales that low price products, intended to bring in a customer and the sell him up is pretty much standard. This did not happened, I'm sure, because I made my case clear, not because Dan was negligent as a salesman. 
One reason I rate this dealership high is because on the road test, my wife noticed that she could not adjust the mirrors. Dan says, no problem. They will fix it. There was no remotes for the keys. No problem, he says. We buy the car. 
To fix the car meant replacing the left door component, not a fuse. No problem. Tomorrow I pick up the remote keys. No problem.

578,"March 18, 2011","Pre-Owned Car Buyers Beware. I bought a pre-owned car from salesperson James Brown. The radio, map lights, back lights, and radio and A/C display did not work. We were told that they would be fixed. We made sure many times that every time the salesperson said the radio and lights were to be fixed that I added, ""And the display, right?""  He verbally assured us that was included. He also assured us multiple times that 2 recalls on the Car Fax Report were fixed.  We asked about it multiple times because wanted a safe car to put toddler in, and we told him so. Each time he told us they take care of all those things before selling pre-owned cars. He said it would take couple of days to fix. Mr. Brown called us to say it was ready for pick-up a few days later.  We drove an hour and 15 minutes one way to get it. When we got there, he told us the map lights and radio were fixed, but not the radio and A/C display or back lights. When asked if he knew when he called to say our car was ready, he did know then and chose not to tell us even though he knew we were driving an hour and 15 minutes one way to the dealership. Lute Riley Honda refused to fix the display even though the salesperson agreed to do it before we paid for the car in full. My husband told him they did not uphold their end of the bargain and do what they verbally said they would do. We were told we needed to pay $1900 more to have it fixed. My husband talked to a manager, and he said it wasn't cost effective to fix it and we needed to pay $1900 because he could sell the car to someone else easily. We didn't even get an apology from the manager. We were treated completely different once they had our money. We ended up taking the car to Frank Kent Honda. They fixed it for $259 ($109 for the parts and $150 for labor), and Lute Riley Honda  wanted $1900.  Frank Kent also told us 2 recalls had not been fixed, and they were the ones that Lute Riley assured us were fixed--one being a serious safety recall with the ignition switch. Frank Kent Honda service dept. even called Lute Riley service dept.. to double check that those recalls were not fixed.  Lute Riley told them that they were not fixed. Our service worker at Frank Kent said that the Lute Riley service worker told him, ""I guess the used car department failed again.""  Frank Kent fixed the recalls for free and even shuttled my husband to and from work while they fixed the back lights, radio and A/C display, and both recalls in just a few hours.

586,"November 24, 2010","There are numerous Honda dealers in the Metroplex/DFW area and we just happened to be driving by Lute Riley and decided to stop in since we were in the market for a Honda Civic LX.  We were greeted by Clint as the entered the lot and he was very friendly and low pressure throughout the sale.  He answered our questions openly and honestly and we felt very comfortable and relaxed.  Lute Riley was the third dealership we had visited and we had done extensive online research so we felt well informed and were prepared to walk away if they could not meet our needs as we knew one of the other numerous dealerships could.  Initially, they were not able to match our desired price for the Civiuc LX or our trade-in, but Aaron (the finance Manager) entered the picture after discussing what we wanted out of a car and suggested a 2010 Accord EX-L he had on the lot.  It was not necessarily something we had considered, but it had everything we had ever wanted in a car at a great, GREAT price.  We were pre-approved with Honda financing and with Aaron's help, that process was super quick and easy as well, and with 0.9% interest, you can't beat it.  Clint nor Aaron gave us any pushy sales pitch for extra options, warranties, etc. and we greatly appreciated that approach!  We ended up purchasing gap insurance and an extended warranty and still paid much less than we had expected.  I usually dread the car buying/negotiation process but this was easy and comfortable.  I would highly recommend either of these gentlemen and Lute Riley!  Thanks!",5.0
587,"November 20, 2010","My girlfriend and myself went to Lute Riley Honda in Richardson to see about purchasing a used car.  We met with a salesman and he informed us that before he could speak to us about purchasing a car, I had to sign an “agreement” that stated that if the both of us agreed upon a price, I would purchase the car.  I told him I really didn’t see the need to sign this “agreement” but he said if I didn’t, he could not show us any cars.

I reluctantly signed the “agreement” only because my girlfriend found a car she liked.  We then started negotiations on the price.  He kept pulling the old routine of going back to the manager when I made counter-offer to their “final price”.  I was getting tired of this and finally when it became apparent we would not agree on price, we got up to leave.

As we were walking out, I saw the salesman speaking to his manager who I later found out was Troy Woods.  As we walked outside, Troy Woods came after us.  It was night-time and we had just stepped out of the building and he followed us outside.  He walked toward us in a threatening manner and he started talking to me in a very loud voice, angry voice. 

He said I had signed an agreement to purchase a car and now I was backing out of our “agreement”.  I told him that we had not agreed upon a price so I was not bound to buy anything. He stared yelling at me, telling me my word was no good and generally doing his best to harass us and embarrass me in front of my girlfriend, which I think was his main intention. 

I could not believe someone that represented a company would act in this threatening, harassing manner.  As you could imagine, I was very angry.  The next day I sent a letter to Lute Riley Honda about what had happened. They responded to my letter basically defending his harassing behavior as being an aggressive sales manager.

I would advise anyone looking to purchase a car to avoid this place unless you want to be forced to sign an “agreement” and then verbally harassed and embarrassed if you don’t purchase a car.  I have never heard of a car dealership pulling this kind of unethical sales tactic.

However, I asked the finance guy if I could purchase an extended warranty later after I had time to think about it and he said no, that it had to be purchased today. I bought it and later I found out that what he said isn't true, you can buy a Honda Care Extended Warranty up to 3 mos or 6,000 miles after the sale. Even after that date or mileage, you can buy an extended warranty albeit at a different rate and coverage.

From the get go, John Butler worked hard to get me into a vehicle which was everything my wife and I wanted, from type to price. He never got annoyed (believe me, we can be annoying) and was patient and really like a friend from my first phone call, to finally helping me get out of a bad deal with Volkswagen and get me into a Honda which has given major relief to my life. I also would like to compliment Shawn Khanchowdhury for the awesome job he did concerning showing me the details of the vehicle and staying there that night even until the lights were off and making sure everything was completed all the way down to the tags being switched from our trade-in to our new Honda. Between John and Shawn, my opinion of people in the car industry has totally been salvaged. After 8 years of sub par treatment with Volkswagen and them always trying to get me in and out and get as much money from me as possible, these two really showed it was more about service and not just making a buck. Between my wife and I from highschool until just this last month have owned 4 VW's so when I say we are loyalists I think it is understood. Because of the service I received, I believe we will be Honda leasers/owners for years to come.

The price was much higher than we were willing to pay and for what the car was worth.  Instead, the salesman wanted to talk about getting me a lower interest rate if I would pay a higher price for the car. Only then would he be willing to ""call in a favor"" from their lendors. At your dealership, I told Mitch the price range and other criteria for what I needed. He quickly gave me the options that met those criteria and I test drove the vehicle. There were no high pressure sales. Mitch and I agreed on the price of the car first and then discussed possibly getting us a lower rate than what we had with our pre-approved lender. And Will Ramos got us a 2% less interest rate! It honestly was the easiest and quickest car purchase I have ever made! Me and my wife will definitly go to Lute Riley when making future car purchases.

       Now after 2 years I almost decided on Toyota Matrix and was contemplating on other facts while my husband wanted an honda insight. my husband forced me into this showroom where we met andrew and he showed us Honda Insight and Honda fit. I didnt like them and I walked out . Outside the showroom Honda CRV was parked and andrew was kind enough to ask us just to take a look at it to have an idea about the model . I liked the model so much and within the same evening I decided to buy it . Andrew was really professional while explaining the finances , showing us different colors of car , making us familiar with resale value and warranty options and many more things . There was no haggling much as Andrew and John were very professional while explaining the facts. this was very contrast to the experience I had 2 years back at Lute riley . I really appreciated the way they made me aware of the price ranges for different models and explaining me how it would come within my budget as APR was 2.9% instead of higher. Abid literally haggled with price for 5 hours during my last visit . 

         So honestly me and husband were having kind of bad experiences in the past month during our car search . But only because of the sales person and also this model of CRV ( which we both liked a lot instantly) made our car buying very easy

Dropped in to look at a Honda Civic on my lunch hour. I was clear with Sherry that my time was limited, that I wasn't ready to buy, and that . 1) Let's get some (tons of) personal information.  Um, let's not.  2) I'll need your license and insurance.  I think not.  3) Here's the base model and the cost is only, well... as much as the fully loaded EX-L I bought from another dealer a week later, including 7 year warranty and TT&L.  4) Does the car have x, y, or z?  I'm not sure, let's go inside... I'm running out of time. Do you actually have the model I'm looking for?  Maybe, but it might be on another lot. So you don't have it here? I don't know. Well other dealers do.  Yes, but we're ""landlocked"" you see.  Um, ok.  Hang on, let me check (burns up 10 minutes). 5) Ok, (sorting through printouts) I will set you up an appointment for Saturday and we should have the car you're looking for. No thanks.

Part II
Dismayed by the old huckster routine, I decided to use a service (for free).  Five dealers were in my search, including Lute Riley.  1) Email Hey, we're the best. Let's set up an appointment for you to come in.  Um, that's not the way it works.  Give me a quote like the other 4 dealers.  2) Phone 1 - Hey, I hear you're looking for a car. Are you going to come in? No, give me a quote like the others. I'm going to test drive the low quote now.  How much? Not the way it works. Give me yours. Um, I need some time.  Well, make up your mind. I'm buying today. Give me 15 minutes.  3) Two hours later as I'm test driving, Richard calls with a late quote which is $800 more than the second highest.  Ok, thanks Richard.

Part III
I purchased from the other dealer and sent a polite email to Richard.  The next day 1) Email 2 - Hey, I'm John Summey.  Want to set up an appointment to come in and see cars?

I had a decent amount of money to get a decent car without financing.  I in no way wanted to finance anything.  I wanted a Nissan, but thought the Honda dealer might have a used Nissan.  There was one car I thought might be ok, so I took it for a test drive.  While I was driving it, someone else asked for my keys and took my car to ""examine"" it.  That was fine, except when I got back, my car was no where to be seen.  I didn't like the car I had test drove, and decided to leave.  They would not give me my keys back.  I asked for OVER AN HOUR for my keys so I could leave.  They kept grabbing different sales managers to come over and talk to me.  They told me how they would work hard to get me a good deal.  I kept trying to explain it didn't matter if they didn't have what I was looking for.  I didn't want what they had in stock.  Finally, the sales guy said ""well why did you even come in here?""  and tossed my keys across the table - which he had been holding this entire time!

After a 25-30 minute walk, when I finally found my car, I noticed a HUGE sign that said ""NO LUTE RILEY PARKING HERE!""  So not only were they obnoxious, tried to hold me hostage, and guilt me into buying something I didn't want, then they parked my car a 20 minute walk down the road in an illegal parking lot where it could have been towed, and told me to go get it myself.  Great customer service.",1.0

Everything was so easy! I love my Accord, and couldn't be happier about the price. I would recommend this dealer to anyone that wants a great car and a good price. ",5.0

618,"October 23, 2009","The absolute worst car buying experience ever. I have been purchasing vehicles for over 20 years and this dealer by far was the worst. Yes I was a victim of the bait and switch trick, I got a quote over the phone and when I got there the price was higher because of dealer add-ons. I drove 3 hours to find a goo deal, but it was a scam. I looked at other cars and decided I wanted a car at the right price, I found one on a Saturday and told them I wanted it, it was really late so I requested they call me on Monday to verify the price and the deal would be done. Monday comes around and no call, I decided to call and to my surprise they sold my car. They lowered the price and I chose another one. The financing agent was clueless on what she was doing, I didn't think buying a vehicle out of state was a big deal but she made it seem like it was something that had never been done. Finally at 10:00pm I thought I am finally done with this dealer, the salesman said he didn't have the user’s manual or the other key to the vehicle so I left with only one key. It took them 1 week to fed-ex me my key and book. I kept receiving phone calls about paperwork being wrong; they tried to charge me an extra $80 supposedly because financing messed up the numbers. I recently received a letter that I had been rejected for GAP Insurance, turns out the overcharged me and will credit back the financing company the difference. I would stay away from this dealer; they are inexperienced self minded individuals. I would definitely pay a little more for a car as long as I get good service. ",1.8
619,"June 08, 2009","do not shop here!! they wanted 28,500 for a black 2008 ex-l 4cyl accord. the car only had a few options on it such as sunroof visor,trunk tray,wheel locks,lip spoiler, we ended up with the haggled price of 23,480 with the yearly detail package with when ever washing. not convent they say that you have to wait 2 hours to get it washed when they washed the car they added lots of swirls one year later when we had it detailed they left buffer marks all over the car and tried to prove us wrong and say all cars have swirls marks and that they are not removable (not true) so they re polished it only adding more swirls.the guy also kept speaking with the sails manger during the purchase.

620,"May 25, 2009","These people are just a bunch liars.
They will give you a quote over the phone and then you will never get the price they quoted you. Internet sales team is a real joke. Also they load vehicles with bunch of overpriced, ugly looking accessories which they also try to add to the price and  which makes it 1500-2500 more than a sticker price. Wheel locks that Honda sells for $65 (when you can find aftermarket for $25) in Lute Riley will cost you $295. Same factor you can apply to everything else they sell. Never will step into this place again!!!",1.0
621,"May 03, 2009","I went in to lease or buy a car with low monthly payments. The salesperson (J.T.) was impolite and said they can't give any numbers without running my credit check. When I told him that I did not have any preference for color and wanted the cheapest car, he said that his computer would not show what's the cheapest car they have! Then he tried to sell me the cars that were on their lot and not what I wanted. After I told him my max. budget, he kept going in to talk to his sales manager and coming back with slightly better numbers every time but never coming close to what I could afford. All this wasted a lot of time. When I said that I already told him how much I could afford, he got irritaed and said that he had to talk to his general manager to get a special deal for me (as if they did a favor to me by doing their business). I told him that I have their best offer and I'll sleep over it, he got rude and pushy and called his sales manager. Both of them tried to show that they did so much for me and I should just take that deal to honor their effort. Anyways, I am not going back to them EVER again.",1.6
622,"July 14, 2007","When I went in to purchase a vehicle, I told AK, who I belive is the used car manager, what my budget was and what I wanted.  He gave me a few options, but none of them fit what I needed.  He kept pushing me to see cars that were way above my price range, and was extremely rude after I went and looked at cheaper vehicles on the lot, and told him which vehicle I wanted.  He told me a price and my payments, but whe I got into the finance office, he had added 2k to the selling price, calling it dealer fees.  I blew up on the finance person, Matt Noel, who did correct the situation, kudos to him, and I purchased the car I wanted.  I WILL NOT PURCHASE AT LUTE RILEY AGAIN.",1.6
623,"March 04, 2007","WORST CAR DEALERSHIP EXPERIENCE EVER. With a chekc in hand, I recently drove from Fort Worth to Lute Rley Honda in search of the 2007 CR-V. I had been dealing with Alan Cooper on the phone and upon arrival he handed me off to another salesman. I told the salesman exactly what we wanted. They took my car keys for a trade-in appraisal, while we looked at a vehicle. The dealership did not have what we wanted,but they tried to high pressure us into buying what they had in stock. After bring me back an estimate on my vehicle trade-in of $1500 less than any other dealer offer I had received, I told them we would not be able to do business. They came up $500 more. This was a true insult. They abosrbed my time and after almost 2 hours of constant pressure I told them I just wanted my car keys so I could go. Alan Cooper then came over and tried to make me feel guilty for the time they spent on a vehicle that was not what I wanted. I had to tell them several times that I would just like my keys so I could go. He became angry and irritated after I demanded my car keys. He then had the nerve to call me on my drive home wanting to know what he could do to make the deal. I informed him that under NO circumstances would I ever deal with Lute Riley Honda.",1.0
624,"December 22, 2003","Brought car in to install security system, was promised rental for the day. Rental not given when we dropped it off so we waited for install to be finished. Finance Manager dragged his feet to respond to our request to cancel the 7yr/100k warranty we bought, had to repeatedly request/concact him. So far though, the service department hasn't done anything wrong to the car yet, especially when we had to replace the tranny(under warranty), it drove like it was brand new after replacement.",2.5
