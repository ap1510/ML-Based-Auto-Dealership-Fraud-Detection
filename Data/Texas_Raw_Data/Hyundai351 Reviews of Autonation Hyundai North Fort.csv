185,"December 15, 2016","Tyler was our sales person and he did a great job.  My comments in this survey do not apply to him at all.  Issues center around the finance person, Jason Roman.  I traded in my car on 11/26 leaving my trade in and talking possession of the car.  As of today I still own 2 cars.  I explained to Jason that I would be financing through my Credit Union and that I would contact them on Monday 11/28 to arrange for payment and get the actual payoff amount.  I did that. Provided a text to Tyler with the payoff amount.   On Tuesday I was called to come in and complete drafting instructions.  Had no idea what this was about because no one ever explained.  I called and talked to Tyler and he turned me over to his sales manager.  I provided to him the phone number and name of the Credit union person ready to provide the funds.  I called on Wednesday for Jason and no answer, left VM and then called again on Thursday and Jason was not at work. On Friday I called the Credit union to see if anyone from the dealership had called her to give her instructions on where to provide funding. No one had called.  Later that day Friday, I received a call from Jason.  Not a pleasant call; I was threatened when Jason stated: either bring in the check or return my car now!  Never been treated like this before.  After the call, I again called the credit union and had them overnight me the check at my expense.  On 12/2 I brought the check into the dealership.  Jason was not there.  Probably a good thing as the meeting would not have been a good one. So here it is 12/14,  I have a new car and still own my old car because the dealership has not completed there part of the transaction.  Until the credit union receives payment, they will not release the title.  So hard for me to recommend your dealership, not from a sales perspective, but from and finance perspective.

192,"December 03, 2016","AutoNation Hyundai NRH way surpassed my expectations! You usually expect the worst at car places, but I had a great experience.  Usually with car places, I expect 1) coming in and there being discrepancies in price/availability/etc. vs. what I saw online 2) having to haggle, argue about ""dealership fees"" to get to a reasonable price and 3) spend hours with paperwork. Instead, I got to see exactly the car I saw online, I got it at the price that was advertised with no crazy or unexpected fees and while it still took awhile to fill out paperwork, that's just what you have to do when getting something so expensive. So it's unreasonable to expect quick transactions with cars (after signing the deal, it was about 1.5-2 hours before leaving)  Tyler was extremely helpful. Very knowledgeable on the cars, honest and straightforward and friendly. He made me feel like I was his only customer and listened well to what I had to say instead of trying to push something on me I didn't want. That helped me seal the deal quicker than anything else.  Everyone else was friendly and helpful, too. Always asking if I needed more water or something else. Not that I really care, but they all looked professional, too.  The service department was able to add a spare tire and detail the car quicker than expected (about 1.5 hours).  The only slight hiccup was in the paperwork, I had looked 2 of the same cars, but different colors and on the last sheet I was signing, I had to sign noticed the color was wrong. So all the sheets I had signed were all the wrong VIN and had to do over a bunch of them. But little mistakes happen and while it would have been big had we not caught it, they were apologetic and worked with all haste to make it right.  Overall, this was a great car buying experience. That's something I thought I'd never say about a car place. I live in Houston and was up here visiting family when I came to NRH, but if I'm still around when in the market again, I'll make sure I stop by.",5.0

First time the car went to service back in June. 25th, 2015, and again in sometime in July 7th, 2015 at different service center but same field tech certified was used for analyze the problem for this Service center adviser said someone connected jumper incorrectly (reversed Red vs black wire) when someone tried to jump start this car. That's incorrect conclusion because if reversed wire were connected wrong then A) some of the jump starter have relay build in to it and will tell you if it is incorrect, and B) If jump starter doesn't have it then car now these days have relay fuse build into it so that should have blown to protect the power circuit. They have just tried to replace the battery.. and try out swapping few fuses and check some wires. After i took the car to independence Electrical and Mechanical Expert(whom is expert in Luxury cars, and any other brand as well. My Independence isolated the problem on the Alternator issue.. over producing current about 4amp (it should be (12v-14v), its producing nearly over 17.5V+ which caused cluster, radio, AC, and any other electronic power module to fry it up. He said, ""Your Service center lied to you about this, it seems they didn't know what they were doing or didn't isolate the issue correctly on the first place and this should be covered under warranty"". The alternator one of wire was disconnected and car started up fine to isolate. I originally purchased this Hyundai because of their warranty they stand behind they claim for 5years to 10 years.

313,"August 15, 2015","Mari is the most unique car salesperson I have ever had the pleasure of working with. Fantastic helpful worker who breaks all stereotypes of car dealerships and experience.
My daughter had earlier returned a Toyota Camry lease and was looking or an SUV. After being extremely disgusted with the runaround Toyota gave us and with what Toyota promises on a lease and what they deliver we left the lot after returning the car and tried our luck at Hyundai. My wife and I purchased a Sonata 3 years ago and it was a great experience so now I accompanied my daughter to see how her lease would go. As soon as we entered Mari was there to greet us then it was all business, She took us inside and asked what my daughter was looking for, took us immediately on the lot and showed us numerous Santa Fe vehicles, very thorough in her explanation of the SUV, options, colors, etc and answered any questions  then it was back to the showroom where she lined up paperwork and a test drive. Never pushy she listened to what my daughter  wanted and delivered.  When the finalized paperwork came back I was very skeptical about monthly payments and expecting the usual BS dickering back and forth so was shocked when the monthly price was exactly what Hyundai said it would be, (shocking since Toyota was over $100 more per month than what they advertised when we were there earlier)  The sales manager even overlooked a $1700 mistake and took the  hit because as he said he was ""A man of his word"" and offered us a  price he was going to live up to. Mari was not pushy and listened to what my daughter wanted and what was best for her, not for Hyundai. We were both happy with the SUV lease deal but  more importantly how well Mari professionally handled everything and the straight forward honesty and friendly demeanor, would highly recommend her which is something I thought I would never say as far as regarding a car salesperson. Her entire job was to make the customer happy. She gave us her personal cell number in case my daughter had questions or problems, showed us service dept and said come in an say hi to her if we were around. Everything you wish every salesperson would be very great experience. Go see her .... you will not be disappointed  (additional information, we had the same great experience with the finance dept, Tu Nygyuang did not push all the extra stuff at all just did what my daughter wanted without any hassle)  ",5.0

317,"August 08, 2015","I went into the Allen Samuels Hyundai dealership with a positive attitude, having already experienced purchasing a car from this dealership in 2004.  I was not disappointed. The salesman who approached my family and me offered us cold bottles of water on the hot summer day and asked how he could help us.  He listened politely as I explained what I was looking for and seated us at his desk. I had done my research on the Internet, as most people do these days, and had some specific ideas as to the vehicle I wanted and the price I felt would be fair.  As a woman, I have sometimes been ""talked down to"" by car salesmen in the past, so I am sensitive to that, but it has never happened to me at Allen Samuels Hyundai, and it did not happen on this day.  My salesman Mo treated me with respect and was very honest about what he could and could not do for me.  After a test drive and just a little bargaining, I was offered an excellent deal on the car I was interested in, a 2015 Santa Fe. I never felt pressured or rushed. Both Mo and the finance people made sure everything was thoroughly explained to me before I signed any paperwork.  After Mo escorted me to my new vehicle, we sat in the front seat for a few minutes and he explained how everything worked, answered all the last minute questions I could think of, and gave me his number to call if I had any problems or further questions. I have now had my Santa Fe for two weeks and I am very pleased with it.  I highly recommend this dealership to anyone who wants to be treated fairly and with respect, and offered the best deal possible.  Thank you, Mo and Allen Samuels Hyundai.  You will continue to have my business in the future.",5.0

320,"July 16, 2015","Went in today to get the back middle seat belt fixed in my Santa Fe. I informed Kenny I had an extended warranty on the car so he called the warranty company. They said I did not have a warranty even though I had the paperwork to prove otherwise. Kenny told me finance must not have submitted the warranty &  I needed to go talk to the finance department. After waiting  45 minutes at the finance center I find out I DO have a warranty, Kenny just called the wrong warranty company!! I go back to the service center he says ""okay have a seat while I check it out."" I ask if he was going to apologize for the 45 minute wild goose chase he sent me on & he said ""no, I've never heard of us selling this warranty so how would I have known to call them."" Even more frustrated I go sit and wait, again. 35 minutes pass Kenny comes in and says ""your warranty doesn't cover the seat belt and you owe $99 for us to see what's wrong."" I told him if the warranty doesn't cover it I will just wait & see if my husband can take a look instead. He said no you have to pay the $99 because you signed the form. Well I never signed anything, I was under the impression he was checking to see if the seat belt was even covered and never agreed to any work. Kenny flipped the forms realized I didn't sign, got up stormed off to where my car was, crumbled up the paperwork, & threw it!! Wow the most unprofessional service I have ever received! My family has purchased 3 vehicles from Allen Samuels and after this we will never return. Future repairs will be done at any other Hyundai service center. ",1.0

328,"June 27, 2015",Regina Loften signed us up for the Hyundai blue link program. We specifically asked several times if the program which was giving us three months of one of the  programs for free and the other program was 12 months free. When she took our credit card information  she told us over and over that it would not charge our card when the free trial ended and we would have to opt in to the membership in order for our card to be charged. Of course I believed her and signed everything and later looking at my paperwork found out that it does in fact charge us automatically when the trial end and the prices she quoted us are not what it will charge us it will be much higher. That day we also set up to have our tint done when we did our 21 day checkup. Not only did they not wash our car ahead of time because their car wash wa sunder maintenance but they got some sort of stain all over the interior of the car under each one it's like something dropped down all over the interior of our brand new car. So since they didn't wash the car for us we can't for several days which they also didn't tell us I had to call and ask about that. Of course when we call to complain they won't have a manger there until Monday. Absolutely ridiculous and it's very frustrating because the entire experience she kept saying to rate them a 10 make sure you give them the highest rating possible. When hyundai sends you a survey they specifically ask you if anyone at the dealership did that. So thanks Regina Loften for being a huge liar and thanks Hyundai for making sure my car was dirtier when I left during your 21 day checkup ,1.0

340,"May 26, 2015","On Saturday (May 23, 2015), my husband took our 2001 Hyundai Elantra with 200K + miles for service.  The check engine light was on.  The cost of the repairs was going to be about $2,500 -- more than we could afford at once and did not want to put more money in such an old car.  So, on Monday (May 25th), my husband went to Allen Samuels Hyundai Fort Worth, TX.  Sales Consultant (Karon Key) promptly greeted us at the door.  She listened to what we were looking for and our budget.  She excused herself and drove around a 2015 silver Hyundai Tucson.  We test drove it.  It was everything that we were looking for.  We went back inside to start the paperwork.  Customer Relations/Delivery Expert (Regina Loften) assisted us with Karon thru the paperwork process.  They made it a breeze.  The finance lady (Christi Henderson)  also saved us almost $200 per month on the car payment that we were originally quoted!!!  We were at the dealership for about 2 1/2 hours total.  Everyone was very friendly and knowledgeable.  There was NO aggressive sales tactics.  We felt that we had a great experience and would highly recommend this dealership.

345,"November 25, 2014","If I had a flux capacitor, I would go back in time and buy the Santa Fe I wanted from another dealership, even if it was $1,000 more, and I mean that. 

To say I was disappointed with the service at Allen Samuels would be an understatement. I had other dealers warn me, and I had read reviews here. Yes, Allen Samuels was the lowest price, but no way was it worth it in retrospect. 

The ratings on Dealerrater, as bad as they are, don't actually tell how bad it actually is there for customers. Yes I was trying to get the best deal, as anyone buying a vehicle does, but were it not for the extremely limited supply of 2015 Santa Fe's, there's no way I would have done business with someone like Terry (sales manager) or Allen Samuels as a whole. The only thing that made that sell even possible was limited supply of a vehicle I really liked, my immediate need for my job, and the low price they were able to provide (at least when compared to the other two models available).

My visit there tomorrow will be my last and I will make sure anyone I know who is interested in a Hyundai (or any vehicle) will stay as far away from there as possible. In retrospect, I would have gladly paid $1,000 extra somewhere else so I could rest better at night knowing my money is not lining the pockets of an awful organization such as Allen Samuels. I still feel dirty about it, and I mean that.

The dishonest games with their pricing (after market adds which serve no purpose other than building profit in for them) may have been eclipsed by the dishonest and relentless pursuit by the financing department for warranties of varying types. 

My sales rep was decent enough but he's trapped in an awful organization. I advised him to run, not walk, to another job as there is no way he will get return business there. He won't get good reviews on the Hyundai survey either and that will unfortunately impact his pay. 

DO NOT DO BUSINESS HERE! Pay more elsewhere if you have to. Trust me. ",1.2

347,"August 13, 2014","If you have ever sold cars or bought a car from dealer that makes you go thru a grinder you will love this place. ALLEN SAMUELS HYUNDAI OF FORT WORTH TX The tactics used were the same of the 1970's etc. Only thing missing is the giant sunglasses used by dealers gone by. Here's my visit in a nut shell on 8-11-14. Using their website 8-10-14 I found and contacted them with question's about internet posted  pricing. Contacted by Anna talked promised to send me info requested and said she can get me our talked about price, being retired on a budget this was great news . So i was E-Mailed a credit app instead with no explaination boy that was hard, received no more help from her. So not giving up and wanting the deal, i called Anna said be there in a hour i'm 40miles away in Cleburne, Tx. Upon arrival could not find her,i and the wife ask and was told she's around here somewhere. Went to desk in showroom asked do you know were the elantras are or have a layout of place because it's the hottest part of the day to be guessing .She replied no. Wife and i saw a person going in showroom area that was kind of private not for public entry looked like some final paperwork area for the salesmen thinking this is a boss he'll know what to do. I ask him were are the cars listed on the web site listed for $13,000-$17,000. He said go out and get a stock number and we will look it up. I asked can't you pull up your web site and  i can get the stock numbers there's a hundred or more cars out there, he turned and entered  his area and that was that.. Not liking his answer i told wife let's get the @$#%^ out of here she said maybe he's having a bad day. Once again we felt the coldness of the dealership he did not offer us water or help or even a salesman. Our age and driving 40 miles and now here, i really wanted the deal promised over the phone. Phone and internet deal not real, designed to get you into dealership i was thinking now. Wife and i went outside to look for ourselves, talked to other customer's outside by themselves and asked them did they know about the great internet deals. Now here a least a hour, salesman Mohamed Ibrahim Mo for short came to our aid, I saw this gentleman in the showroom earlier but sitting with customers doing paper work. MO did everything possible to make us comfortable, saw we needed  water and got it. MO worked with us but the dealership didn't live up to their verbal promise's. MO did fight for us and tried to explained our so far visit and tried to get them to make it right. I could tell you more but it . get's worse, we did not buy. MO this dealership doesn't deserve you, your are the only one there that i talked to that knows what the word empathy means. I told this ANNA up front i read the . . rebates and disclaimers and told them i only qualified for the Hyundai $1500.00 rebate and what the dealership could do for me. I'm not a student grad, military etc stuff where i could get more savings. We don't dress well, are clothes are old but clean, I guess upon arrival and being sized up old and retired we didn't look like someone who could afford a car, or worth wasting time on. We did buy a Elantra the next day with far more success at Jerry's Hyundai in Weatherford TX. Wow what a place Salesman Collin, and David Biggs not only lived up to the  verbal price given over phone but got me a lower rate than 2.99% my credit union pre-approved me for. Before starting this adventure of buying a car.  plus a backup camera for my wife, and more to restore my faith that there is a dealership with empathy and like the old days of Texas your word was good as ink.",1.0
348,"July 09, 2014","I found online a really good price on an elantra GT $12200. The total savings online were $7200 which I wasn't expecting to get the hole amount. After 2 and a half hours the sales person comes with the outstanding offer of $18500. 

He didn't even know how to explain the rebates. I had a total rebate of $2000 and no expansion whatsoever about me no qualifying for the other rebates. Please do not believe the online price. No respect for the costumers.",2.2
349,"July 07, 2014"," My husband and I had a horrible experience with this dealership this weekend.  First, we went on Thursday, July 3rd, to test drive the Hyudnai Elantra.  We loved it.  Denise, our saleswoman seemed very nice and professional, and even identified a rebate that I qualified for without me asking.  We told her that the price online that brought us in was 13,595 (5,570 discount off msrp), and we were looking for 3,000 for our trade-in.  Note: on the website it listed the ""*Discount"" as $5,570, and the ""Sale Price"" as $13,595.

The next day we came back, and they lost our information, so we had to go through everything again.  To make a long story short, 3.5 hours in to our 2nd visit they tell us that the discounted price online is actually due to $3900 in available rebates for which you have to qualify and only $1670 was an acutal discount, so the price went up to just over 17 grand, plus a $1250 security package that they failed to mention came with every car and was not optional, bringing our total before taxes and fees to $18,345. YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING, RIGHT? No, not kidding.

Oh, and remember that trade-in we wanted $3,000 for? $50. Yes, you're reading correctly - THEY OFFERED US $50 FOR OUR TRADE-IN.

Back to the online price: There was absolutely no clear indication the the ""Discount"" were rebates and discounts combined. After arguing with the Finance Manager for 30 minutes about truth-in advertising requirments, he offered to take $500 more off the price.  We considered it briefly because it made it just under what we were offered for the Toyota Corrolla at another dealership.  I assure you, we only considered it out of sheer exhaustion and at the loathing thought of having wasted 4 hours at this place on the 4th of July.  I'm happy to report, we did not make a deal with this crooked dealership, and we are reporting them to the FTC.  On their website, I see that they just made a change to cover themselves, but we took screenshots of the website the day it happened.  They now list what said ""Discount"" as ""Available Savings.""

And the cherry on top: while they had our car in their shop to appraise it, they took pins out of the the lining in the trunk, and didn't put them back in, so now our lining is hanging off.  I cannot tell you why they would take them out in the first place, but they did.
