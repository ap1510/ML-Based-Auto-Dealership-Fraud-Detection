0,"February 04, 2020",I drive by other dealers including another KIA dealer to get to Gay Family Kia for service. They are great and have resolved problems that the other dealer couldn’t or wouldn’t. Everyone in Service was friendly and helpful. My service writer was Kevin and the manager wS Brad. I will look here first to buy my next KIA. ,5.0
1,"July 02, 2019","Lee Fox is the man to see!!! I was greeted as soon as i arrived. He was EXTREMELY helpful and patient as we spent the whole day looking for the right car with the right price. He did EVERTHING in his power to help me pull off the lot in a NEW CAR! The entire staff was awesome. They have a great area to entertain little ones, and even made us popcorn, and offered refreshments. The financing department took their time explaining and breaking down every detail of my loan. I am VERY GRATEFUL i decided to stop in, and would HIGHLY recommend that you do the same! THANK YOU Gay Family Kia!!!!!!",5.0
2,"June 25, 2019","We went to Gay Family Kia via the Carpro Show. We messaged Dylan and he was quick to respond with pricing.
My wife and I went in for test drive everything went well. Dylan was friendly , and even lowered our interest rate than what we had for our bank. Saving us money.
The experience was exeunt and efficient.",5.0
3,"November 20, 2018","I was quoted a price through text message and over the phone. When I got there I was told I misunderstood and they presented me with a higher price. Not once did the salesman, sales manager, or the GM attempt to honor what they said. I wouldn’t go to this dealership.",1.0
4,"May 14, 2018",I am new to the area and have had 3 visits to Kia for various reasons.  Each time my needs were met quickly and thoroughly.  Service was helpful in letting me know what was due and was not needed to be done yet.  JT was especially helpful and accommodating.  I can recommend this service department  with no reservations.  ,4.8
5,"April 07, 2018","After having the WORST experience at another Houston area Kia dealership, I found a 2018 Soul on Gay’s website. I requested contact on the vehicle and Jack called me back almost immediately!! I made a fair cash offer, and in under 5 minutes a deal was made! we set an appointment, I made the arrangements on my end, and even though I showed up over an hour early for my appointment, Jack expedited the entire process to get me out the door efficiently! Jack and the entire staff were super fun, friendly, and such a pleasure to meet and do business with! Ben was terrific and handled the financial end so smoothly!! No surprises, and such a great personable guy!! If you’ve never considered a Kia or are looking to purchase another, I highly recommend using Gay Kia as your dealership of choice! Give Jack a call!! He will show you a great experience!! Two thumbs up!!",5.0
6,"December 21, 2017","After a three week advanced appointment for a 2 hour estimated repair turned into over 5 hours of  waiting and a 2.5 hour wait on a promised shuttle to the shopping center just 2 miles away. So we declined when told it would be another hour til car was done ...2.5 hours later we're told only 15 minutes more....OMG this is the worst expierence ever...empty coffee pot, no snacks and waiting for people to go and get back from lunch had to reschedule our lunch plans and work day ...just very frustrating when people don't do as promised or respect your time...I'll find another Kia dealer to get my business.",1.2
7,"November 16, 2017","I just purchased my second car from Gay Family Kia, and have been consistently happy with the service provided. This last vehicle, which I got for my mom, left her impressed as well. They are very helpful, thoughtful, and don’t pressure you. I have nothing but wonderful things to say about both Kilan, the salesman, and Mike, the manager. They make the car buying experience SO easy. ",5.0
8,"May 11, 2017","5-10-2017. What a wonderful car buying experience.  Dealing with Kilan Anderson and the Gay Kia group was as good as it can get, And drove away with a great Kia Sorento. Thank you all, Stu and Judy",5.0
9,"March 24, 2017","Gay Family Kia will have my business for life. More specifically, Kilan Anderson. From the first question I had to this very moment, Kilan has been there for me. My wife and I are currently in the market for a vehicle. After shopping dealership after dealership, (hearing the ""same old same old"") we finally ended up at Gay Family Auto. Kilan has been patient, kind, and understanding of our situation throughout the entire process. Although we have not yet purchased a vehicle, I know Kilan at Gay Family Auto is our Car Guy for life! Go see Kilan for a true #CustomersCome1stGuarantee",5.0

12,"October 09, 2016","After shopping for months of the car I wish to have in my life, I came across gay family kia with the model I was looking for ( color to top it ). Somewhat painless process, there is always some hesitates for the first buy. ",4.8
13,"October 02, 2016",I shopped on the internet and drove out of my way to visit Gay Family Kia.   It was worth the trip! Trevor was our salesman.  He was very knowledgeable.  He was very patient and answered all of our questions.  He made sure we loved our Kia Soul.  He even included leather seats to be added to the car.  Made it such a sweet deal! The whole process was about 2 and 1/2 hours.  From test driving to finalizing the sale.  We are very happy with our Kia Soul.  We will definitely refer friends to Gay Family Kia and Trevor!,5.0
14,"September 22, 2016","I came across the ""summer on us"" sale from a recommendation by my mother.   I was a first time care buyer and excited but also nervous as anyone would be.  After a nice greeting from my Salesman Kilan Anderson we began to talk about what I was needing and what we could work on amongst the limitless options.  The entire time during our discussions and test drives he was always clear,  respectful  and also motivated.  Taking Kilan and my mother's suggestions and advice I a brand new shining 2016 Kia Forte  and I could not be happier with my purchase.  Me and Kilan still stay in touch  and I look forward to riding in my car and not my bycicle every day of the week.  My first oil change will be happening this month and I plan on going to the dealership and expect nothing but the same excellent experience  I received last time I was there.       Continue you're ascent! ",4.8

20,"September 12, 2016","I would not recommend anyone to shop here. This is the 2nd, but by far the worst experience we've had with a Kia dealership in a month's time when trying to purchase a 2017 Kia Sportage. The sales guy I was dealing with was Ben Waxmen at Gay Family Kia. First off I live in Richmond, Tx and prior to going all the way to Dickinson I informed Ben that i'd prefer to do everything via electronic means so that when I arrive in the office I just sign the finance paper work, grab the keys and go. Keep in mind I already had a pre-approval from a bank, therefore, the process to buy the vehicle shouldve been a breeze. Ben lied via text and email stating that all the paper work was done and submitted to the bank and the vehicle will be ready on Saturday, 9/10/16 when I come in to the office and that I should be there no more than 1hr, if that. I arrive to be greeted by Johnny Johnson (another sales guy) who informs me that Ben is on vacation, but supposedly did not inform anyone of his appt that he had scheduled for the day. Who on earth would schedule an appt two days prior to going on vacation and then not inform the person you scheduled it with?!!! Johnny ensured me that he could handle everything and attempt to pick up where we may have left off. So, Johnny couldnt find the vehicle that was on the deal and brought out 2 others with different prices from the original one. Then when he found the original vehicle he couldnt find the key, the paper was also not submitted to the bank, as Ben claimed and the price of the vehicle, according to Johnny, was not the same price that Ben assured me that I would be paying (via text). Additionally, I asked Ben two days prior to arriving if there were any other fees associated with the vehicle outside of TT&L, and of course he stated that the only price I'd have to pay for the vehicle was $21,870 + TT&L. However, after Johnny brought out a document showing dealer fees and document fees pricing over $800, not to mention a vehicle with a price tage of nearly $2,000 more than what Ben stated the vehicle would be. Not to mention Johnny informed me that since I was using a bank that wasnt provided by them that would add $1,000 on to the price of the vehicle (which Ben also failed to mention). Now after driving more than 1hr in the rain to get to this location, with a disabled person in my vehicle waiting for a prolonged period of time. I requested to speak with the sales manager that Ben claimed to have done this deal with prior to me arriving and ironically, there was no sales manager who was aware of Ben's deal at all. So the sales manager that was on duty, pretty much did not want to deal with us and told Johnny to inform us that if we wanted to voice our complaint then we'll have to wait, but he pretty much wasnt gonna do anything about the lying salesperson who wasted our time and gas just to get us there (WHILE ALREADY HAVING A PRE-APPROVAL) so we left! I would not recommend anyone to purchase a vehicle from this money hungry place, they did not even offer us water when we arrived like most dealerships do out of courtesy, but apparently, their minds was too focused on attempting to make a sale on a rainy day.",1.0
21,"September 02, 2016",Was looking for a Forte the sales person decided what I could afford never follow up or called back. I expressed to my sales person that I wanted a rear facing camera. His response to me was that will be $2000 more. He never offered me any options or anything thing. I was very disappointed. I went to Archer Kia and got an Optima with everything that I wanted and a bigger car. I felt I was over looked due to my appearance. I was in my work attire. After getting my car I get a call asking when am I going to pick up my car. I told the caller I already purchased a vehicle and she stated that she could have matched the deal. It's not about the deal its about customer service. Needless to say Gay Family Kia will not get any of my business. I also notice that the sales person I dealt with is no longer there. ,1.4

35,"May 10, 2016","Easiest new auto purchase. Trevor was waiting when we arrived at the dealership for the test drive, and after explaining some features of the 2016 Sorento XL we were off. Impressive vehicle. Certainly lived up to its Consumer Reports top-rated mid-size SUV rating. The negotiation process with Daniel and Trevor was respectful and without the high pressure. Didn't take long to wrap up the sale. Financing didn't take long. From arrival at Gay Family Kia to departure took about 3 hours. Very happy with the new Kia. First one. First time to deal with Gay Family Kia. Good experience. ",5.0
36,"May 09, 2016",This is my first time buying a new vehicle and they made it a great car buying experience!!

42,"April 29, 2016","We found a 2014 KIA Soul on Internet that we were interested in @ Gay GMC.  I calculated the price & payment to close the deal upon arrival.  We were treated well by sales personnel, test drove car & started the purchase process.  The only hiccup in the process was they GM insisted on adding their warranty service into the pricing, throwing the numbers off by $1000, even though I indicated I wasn't interested in the warranty. Upon signing, the warranty was included in the ft onslaught numbers raising the price, the monthly payment & the interest loan. When I told them I would not purchase car with the increases, the warranty service was dropped, the price was readjusted, the interest rate dropped by 1.2%, we agreed, signed and departed with the vehicle, washed with a full tank of gas.  Overall a great experience, a 2 hour in & out purchase. 

Note: 4 out of 5 stars - When a customer refuses a extended warranty/service agreement, honor the request, saves everyone time.",4.8

56,"March 24, 2016","I am very disgusted with my recent experience with Gay Family Kia.  They have a 2015 Kia Optima Hybrid listed for sale at $22,580.  I asked my salesman, if the hybrid listed for $22,580, was still available.  My salesman repeated the $22,580 figure and asked if I wanted to test drive the car.  After the test drive, I offered $22,580 plus tax, title, and license and your dealership responded with an offer of $26,580 because of an additional ~$4,000 in Gay Family Kia added ""packages"".  I find it ridiculous that part of this ""package"" that Gay Family Kia is touting are wheel locks that are listed by Kia for $55.00 MSRP.

I wasted my time at this dealership with the bait and switch tactics and at this point, I will never buy a car from Gay Family Kia.   Advertise the car for the price on your website that includes these added on ""accessories"" and stop wasting people's (like me) time!

This experience destroyed my family's previous favorable interactions of this dealership.  I had previously assisted a good friend of mine with purchasing a Kia Optima from Gay Family Kia.  I will now never recommend this dealership to my friends or family.",1.3

63,"March 15, 2016","I purchased my car in December, I read all the great reviews so I thought I would give it a try. It was my first time buying a brand new car. The woman I dealt with didn't know anything about cars and finally when I got them talked down to the price I could do (since I had 5,000 equity) some how I still came out upside down 9,000. I am not happy with them at all. I tried calling and emailing to cancel my warranties, NO RESPONSE. I called to see if I could set up a service appointment for my car, NO RESPONSE. I found this place incredibly terrible. If your a first time buyer, I would suggest NOT GOING THERE. After getting approved signing all the paper work they came back a few days later saying I needed a cosigner or I would need to return the car. AFTER HAVING A SIGNED CONTRACT. Also, they give you $100 gift cards to give them 5 star reviews. I don't need the money that bad to lie over the internet about how they ruined my car buying experience. ",1.0
64,"March 13, 2016","If you want to feel like being taken advantage of , or appreciate your time being wasted, go see Scott ( the Internet Manager) as he says.  He will make you feel right at home.  Went in to buy a 2015 Optima from researching on the Internet.  MSRP was rounded to $23000.00.  All discounts were loaded on the sales price on the Internet, which equaled approximately $9000.00.  Not everyone qualifies for all of the discounts, and I get that, but since this car was a 2015 model with 4000+ miles, I was told by Scott that the discounts I did not qualify for would be subsidized by the demo mileage.  I had a trade in valued at $2500, but I owed about $10000 so I was already prepared to role over the negative equity from my current trade.  As well, I needed to apply with Kia financial institution in order to qualify for $2500.00 of the $9000.00.  My credit was not the strongest, but was satisfactory enough to finance through Kia.  I was involved in typical car sales games that were popular in the 80's and 90's.  It came to a head when Scott eventually told me that my payment for a Kia Optima was going to be $700+ a month at 18 % APR.  I thought it seemed excessively high, so I asked what was the term, to which he replied... 72 months.  I asked what the sales price was, and he told me I did not qualify for any of the discounts, and it was so high because I had negative equity.  I asked why I did not qualify for any of $9000.00 discounts, to which Scott told me : It does not matter what the price is.  My wife and I left extremely upset.  So Scott and your sales manager... Thank you for the horrible experience with Gay Family Kia!!!  Thank you for consistently lying to me!!!  Thank you for trying to take advantage of me by constantly focusing on payment and not sales price!!!  Lastly- thank you for reminding me that there are still car dealerships out there that practice the awful antics from the 80's and 90's that gave you bad names and reputations!!!  Because of my mistreatment, I will express my dissatisfaction on multiple outlets and venues. ",1.4

66,"March 10, 2016","Buyer look elsewhere
I went in to purchase a new KIA for my son to take to college. We drove a couple of models and decided on the one we liked. The dealer had added a Gay value package to the ones that we looked at to the tune of 3 plus thousand dollars. I ask Ryan to work me up a price without that package as the factory warranty was good enough for me.Ryan seemed very annoyed as there were several people looking at cars that day. I gave him my phone number and e-mail address and ask when things slowed down to call,text and or e-mail me with the correct price as we had a ball game to get to with my younger son.

After a week and no contact I went to another dealer and was able to get a car without the bait and switch pricing (advertised one thing only to get to the dealer to find out they added a sealer and jacked up the price 3plus k)

A coupe more weeks go by and I get an e-mail from Ryan at Gay showing current sales,I sent Ryan an e-mail back and ask to be taken off the list and explained why. A few weeks later (today) I get another e-mail from Ryan with more advertising. I e-mailed Ryan back and ask to be removed yet again or I would share my negative experience. What happened next ? Ryan within an hour sent the advertisement e-mail again.

It's one thing not to followup with a potential buyer especially one that was looking to buy local but it's another to not honor a request and then immediately do what you were ask not to do.

It's sad that this place has turned to these kind of tactics It's also sad that Ryan is still employed there since he is the reason for several of the negative reviews at this dealership.

I  knew that I wanted a Kia Soul, corresponded with Amber by email and phone before I went to the dealership (it's more than an hour drive from where I live, and I wanted to be relatively certain that I had things in place before I got there), and once I did make the trip, I was driving home in my new car within a couple of hours.

139,"December 19, 2015","First of all I was pre approved for a loan through Capital One. So I went in to pick out the car that Capital One and Kia's website said that I could afford which was an Kia Sportage 2015 and my payments would have been under $350 a month. But, when I got there you can't get those prices they are advertising unless you do ""kia financing, and are a veteran, and have a bachelors degree etc. Anyways they seemed pretty certain that they can get me a better deal then what capital one could. So they ran my credit, played all the silly games they always play. Needless to say I didn't get out of there with the car I wanted nor the payments I wanted. I ended up with a Kia Optima 2015 that was a loaner car that has a little under 5,000 miles on it a small crack in the windshield, and a car that pulled a little to the right as I drove. I am fine with the car is the nice car, I mentioned it to the sales person and their staff about my small issue and the only thing they fixed was my tire. Then they ask you to fill out these five online reviews so that they can look good and as a token of appreciation they will give you for $25 Walmart gift cards.
Well I did all those and it takes a very long time for all them reviews to post to the websites so you can prove to them that you did it to get your gift cards.  Well, I have been thinking to myself maybe I would rather share my story instead get my $100 gift card. I'm not going to lie about my experience to make them look good, then have to wait forever to get a little reward.

It was one week ago.
Buying a new car is not an alway exciting moment for everyone because you heard lots of frustrated story with a bad car dealers.
I had a good experience with Kilan Anderson. He is internet sales manager.
I arrived Gay Family Kia when the dealership starts open. He is waiting for me without any waitings. This dealership's office is open space so that it does not feel small space. However, I realized that they try to optimize their space using and it cost down running their dealership in making a good business case.
Their inventory is enormous so that you have plenty of choices.
Kilan Anderson is a responsible business man. I can see how he can negotiate with me and handle his boss so that my purchase was extremely smooth. The final door out price is amazing as well.
If you are looking for a new car, I highly recommend Kilan Anderson in Gay Family Kia.",5.0

I decided to look around some more after my initial visit that day just to be sure and after looking around all day, I came back to their dealership just before closing to get the car.

He gave us time to  discuss our decision privately and we drove off in a brand new 2015 vehicle with an outstanding warranty and maintenance plan. Clint, the finance officer, was excellent and made the 'horrific paperwork - money part' of the deal totally relaxed, simple and nonthreatening.

My wife and I visited Gay Family Kia on Friday, July 3rd. We were not really planning on buying that day but wanted to check out the dealership and get an idea of what sort of deal we might expect when we were ready to buy. We've been a one car family for several years and had not needed a second vehicle until recently, so we were taking our time and looking for the right deal. Our plan was to trade in our one vehicle (which had us making a higher car payment than we were really happy with) for a less expensive new vehicle for my wife. Our thought was that after a few months of making the lower car payment we'd save up a bit and find an inexpensive used vehicle for myself. Right from the start we were made to feel comfortable. There was no pressure whatsoever and if anything the folks we dealt with just wanted to make sure we were happy with our experience. We explained our situation to Amber and Daniel (who both helped us on a busy day, all while tending to multiple customers) and talked to them about our game plan they worked hard to get us a great deal....on TWO new vehicles! We ended up purchasing two new Rio LX sedans and ended up paying just over what we were paying for our one vehicle (which we traded in and were given an excellent trade value for!). I'm not sure I have ever been to a dealership that went out of their way to make sure I was happy and that I felt I received a great deal....until now. Gay Family Kia earned my business and I would gladly return should I find myself in need of another car. If you are in the market for a new (or used) vehicle, give them a shot - ask for Amber or Daniel - I bet you'll be glad you did!",5.0
294,"July 11, 2015","We visited Gay family KIA to buy a vehicle (cash), after a looong wait around 40 min a customer representative finally showed us the car we were interested on, we talked about numbers... then he played angry, he went back to the office to talked with the manager (I guess), then he came back and said;  we cannot give you that price.. that was all.. no room for negotiation or the minimum action to kept the customer interested

Then when she calls the next day they have no idea what is going on with her car..""the GUY that handles her car is not working that day...) What a bunch of clueless goobers. Also there service area is way in the back of the car lot like some 3rd world junk yard.

Instead of apologizing for the long wait, the sales manager Steve sarcastically said ""Hey, Kilan, didn't you check to see if he had a time limit? You should have checked."" I said ""Thanks for the answer"" and walked out. No one wants or expects to get a response like that when they are shopping for an expensive new car. Steve did everything to lose my business. My guess is, this dealership had no intention of honoring the confirmed internet price and Steve's smartass comment was designed to make me leave. It worked. I will never go back. ",1.5

The day I went in, Steve was apparently on vacation and everyone left at the dealership couldn't care less if I was there. It was about 10:45 am and it was lightly misting rain, so maybe that kept everyone inside while I walked through the lot alone. When I went in and found that Steve wasn't there, a woman did help me get an appraisal done, and then showed me the price on a car similar to what I wanted, but no where near the prices that the previously mentioned Mr. Irwin had told me about, I have done business here previously, but I felt like I had walked in on someone stepping out of the shower. There was no negotiation, further discussion, just blank -that's the price.... So I walked out like they obviously wanted me to do.

(1) Very straightforward, does not play games. Tell him what you want up front. If you don't like something, tell him that also. He needs to know what he's dealing with. If so, he can really help you get exactly what you want.
(2) First-class salesman! Friendly, perceptive, and VERY competent and knowledgeable.
(3) Outstanding backup team - he's not alone in this. Sales Manager, Finance Manager all outstanding.
(4) The Place - spotless, beautiful, and open until late in the evening!
(5) Efficiency - it was a grand total of 3 hours and 11 minutes from when we agreed on a price until my daughter drove the car off the lot.
(6) They work well with their national office and can get you all kinds of incentives.
(7) Last one not due to Ben - the CAR itself. He had an advantage he did not know - I'm an engineering professor and familiar with the VERY state-of-the-art FMS (flexible manufacturing system to laymen) KIA uses in their plants to put these magnificent cars together. So I knew he was selling a better car! I waited a while to tell him that, though, LOL.

I love my new KIA and won't ever go anywhere else for a new vehicle!,5.0
343,"August 06, 2013","I went to Family Kia to see about purchasing a new 2013 Kia Soul +.  When I left to go the the dealership I was somewhat ambivalent about purchasing a new car, especially a brand I had no experience with.  However, when I first arrived at the dealership I was very warmly greeted my Mirian Carranza.  I very much appreciated that she did not stalk me like a vulcer with its prey.  She quietly kept herself available for any questions and gave me all the space I need to check out what they had.  When I was ready to ask questions she answered honestly and sincerely and ... if she did not know the answer she did not pretend to know.  She found out the answers to my questions and promptly came back to me.  When it was time to negotiate a price I just knew I would have to haggle like one has to  at other dealership.  This was not the case with Mirian or with Family Kia.  I offered a price and logically presented why I thought they should meet that price.  They accepted my price and things progressed from there.  The financing department was just as easy to work with.  I told them what I wanted and they obliged sometimes offering other options which they left up to me to choose.  The entire experience caught me off guard.  I expected to have to haggle and get stressed out, but that never happened!  It felt almost like I was dealing with familly!  Mirian Carranza's warmth and personality combined with the personality of the dealership as a whole, made my buying experience one of the best experiences I've ever had!  Thank you MIRIAN CARRANZA and GAY FAMILY KIA!!!

346,"May 20, 2013",This is our second purchase from Family Kia and both experiences have been very postive- John (our salesman) took good care of us and was very upfront about everything. They also have a great service department and I would highly recommend them if you are looking for a new vehicle! ,5.0
347,"March 27, 2011","When I visited this dealership, I received a written quote of the price + TTL of the SUV I had decided upon. On the subsequent visit to purchase, after waiting an hour to have the deal finalized with the finance manager, he wrote a different amount on the same piece of paper and stated that that amount was the drive out amount. It was more than the written quote + TTL that I had in hand. I questioned the additional price being added after I had received the first quote earlier in the week.(I had made it clear in my initial visit that I wanted no extras, like VIN etching, free lifetime oil changes, undercoating, advertising costs,etc. added after the final quote. The only additions were to be TTL costs.) I decided  I was not going to spend any more time at the dealership to haggle over what I thought had been  a firm quote. I left and went immediately to a different dealership, an hour further from my home, and got the same vehicle with additional options, for less than Family Kia's original quote. The salesman at Family Kia I had  dealt with originally was great, but other personnel were not so great, i.e. the finance manager. Also, the sales manager was the person who had given me the written quote, in the presence of my salesman, so it was not a quote that needed to be approved by someone in authority. I would think the manager is the authority. I don't know whether this is their normal way to do business, but I will not recommend them in the future to my friends or associates due to the type of tactics they used. I had spent the prior two weeks online researching the fair price I should pay for the vehicle, including purchasing a Consumer Reports printout with invoice amount, costs of options/ packages , etc. I had also received pricing on the Edmund's website as well as  CarPrices.com. I felt that Family's quote , though not the lowest I had received , was a fair price and I preferred to use them, is spite of having two lower quotes, due to their close proximity  to my home. However, in retrospect, I am sorry I ever considered this dealership. FYI, I am a 60+ year old female and perhaps this affected their selling tactics toward me, or perhaps it didn't.",3.0
