0,"June 21, 2020","A HUGE thank you to Dan Casanova for a wonderful car buying experience! I'm the person who hides from salespeople because I just don't have it in me to deal with the runaround.  Dan is friendly, professional and went the extra mile to make sure I was 100% satisfied - not just talk the talk until you sign. If you are looking for a car, go see Dan - he will make it happen!

3,"April 28, 2020","My second trip to Red McCombs Paint & Body shop at this location in the past 45 days.  NOT because they stink, but because other drivers do!

In the Paint & Body Shop I deal with Gregg.  He is the best... EVER!  His professionalism, customer service, and his drive to make sure each and every customer is 100% satisfied prior to leaving is why I have been going here for over 10 years.

This last visit, was again, one without disappointment.  His ""Number One Guy"", David, did some quick, but very thorough body work on my F150 while I waited.  It took, maybe 30 minutes total time.

For all of the work that was accomplished I was quoted $500-$750.  You'd be amazed at how much of a bargain it was after all was said and done. 

Superb Customer Service, Highly Personal Service, and Great Pricing are why I'm hooked for life! ",5.0

13,"October 27, 2017","I had a good experience at Red's.  Carla met me in the lot and we looked at a car.  I researched this a lot so I knew what I wanted and went right to the car.  Carla explained the process and we got started.  I received what I expected on my trade and I feel I received good value for my money.  Things went smoothly.  I am happy with my car.  I intend to give the car to my granddaughter when she is old enough to drive and she approved of the car when I bought it.

It also handles like an Indy Car with the traction control and large wheels. As for the dealership, there is a sign at the front door that pretty much reads ""Entering a stress free zone"". It is right, this has been as much of a pleasurable experience as buying a new car experience could be.  The staff that took care of me were honest and shot straight with me as they had some difficulties getting me qualified due to some issues I had. I am happy to say that they were able to make everything work out and I am driving a car that I love!

35,"June 01, 2017","Last Monday May 29th I found in their website a Hyundai Santa Fe 2016 for $14,211.00 so I went there to take a look. The first thing I asked for was if that was the right price, the sales person Savannah Francis, said yes! It's, please take a test drive, and asked for my driver's license, she took a copy, and return with the car keys. After a test drive a said, fine I will take the car, then she called the ""manager"" Jason Bell, he asked me about my credit score because the vehicle price depends on how my credit is. After a long time he returned with a statement showing me a price for more than $20,000.00 before tax. After that they even tried to hide some kind of insurance that inflates the final price about $25,000.00 the finance man said if you want to buy the car you've to buy the extra unnecessary insurance. At the end I buy nothing, but some people didn't check what they hide into? the final contract, and finished paying a really high price. They have to show up, the right price, the interest rate, and not to take advantage of the poor people.",1.0

52,"March 31, 2017","Overall, my experience, as rated, was pretty good overall, however there were definite things I did not enjoy. First, the moment I parked, a staff member came straight down and waited around my car until I got out. I did not like this, as I did not even have time to get out my car before she was already on her way, nor did I get the chance to walk the lot to see things myself. Another thing I did not like was when my sales representative asked me if I wanted to go inside and ""discuss numbers"". I explicitly let her know that I ONLY wanted to know he final sale price and I was NOT buying a car that day, and that I would return the following day if the price was right to buy the vehicle, as I was on a time crunch and needed to make a three hour drive out of town in order to make it to an engagement I had planned. After the pricing was discussed, she nonchalantly said as she was getting up to talk to the sales manager that she would go ahead and get them to start washing my car and fill it up for me. She left before I could tell her I did not want to buy the car that day, however, I was very frustrated as I told her at least three times that day that I did not have much time, and was not buying a car that day, and I also told her this at least once, but I believe twice over the phone prior to my arrival at the dealership. This behavior seemed very shady and passive aggressive, so if it were not for the fact that I already went to another dealership, and the price I was being offered was better here than the other Hyundai dealership, I would have been very livid and uncomfortable. So already being unhappy about this, I was then left for easily 30-40 minutes, and no one came to check on me or update me on what was going on. I was very angry at this point, since (1) I was purchasing a vehicle and expected more attention and care than being left without explanation, and (2) my sales rep KNEW I needed to be on the road. After getting up from my chair and pacing around, a staff member told me I would be helped in just a minute. FINALLY someone else noticed my annoyance and took me straight back to the finance manager. He was a nice guy, but for the longest he kept trying to up-sell me. I specifically told him that I did not have time, and let him know the monthly payments I wanted to stay at ($350) and have a 60 month repayment period. He, however, continued pushing for a 72 month duration, and much higher monthly payments, putting me over $400, despite me telling him I was not comfortable with that. Again, my experience overall was good, and I love my car, but if I was not as prepared as I was, I would have been very displeased, and having my need to leave ignored was not appreciated.",4.0
53,"March 28, 2017",I just want to say that both James and Hope worked with me to get me the car I wanted and they were excellent.  I also had challenging credit and they were able to overcome that obstacle.  They were accommodating in delivering my car to me at the airport while I switched out my rental car.  I absolutely would recommend and in four years I will return to purchase my next vehicle.,5.0
54,"March 24, 2017","James called me to tell me they had bought a 2016 Genesis Coupe from another dealer, and would I be interested? we made an appointment to see the vehicle, and after negotiation price and trade in, we purchased the car. I suspect that a buyers history showed that we had owned 2 other Coupes before, and might be interested in trading our 2014 Tuscan, turned out it was a smart move for him, as we did the deal.",5.0

63,"February 08, 2017","Having never purchased a vehicle from a dealership, I had this bad image of pushy sales people in my mind, but sales consultant Momen Itayim squashed the stereotype. Momen Itayim quickly greeted me as I arrived on the lot. Having a vehicle in mind we were off on a test drive in less than 15min of my arrival. Momen Itayim was very detailed in describing the vehicles features and not only answered my questions but got back to me with the answers to questions he didn't know. Needless to say I purchased the new vehicle at a great price with a no hassle, stress free experience! I would recommend Red McCombs Superior Hyundai and definitely recommend sales consultant Momen Itayim for a smooth purchase!",4.8

165,"May 04, 2016","I took my 2009 Hyundai in to have a recalled part replaced and about a week later received a call inquiring if I was considering trading for a newer vehicle. I explained to him that I tried previously at Mission Mitsubishi and was told with my credit and trade if still have to put between 2 and 3k down and that wasn't feasible for me right now so I'd rather not. Hershey, my salesman, said it wouldn't hurt to try and that he was dedicated to find a deal and new car for me. I told him I didn't believe him but I would give him a chance and if he was successful, he could look me in my face and say I told you so! Well, I was allowed to keep the car for a few days and upon returning to the dealership, after Hershey greeted me he gave me a smile and the ""I told you so"" I was not expecting to hear. Not only did he get me a lower interest rate than I had on my previous car loan, he was able to keep the payment in exactly the range I said. That part was important to me because ""new car fever"" will have you agree to pay more than you know you can afford and we all know how that can end up. In the past after making a big purchase, I tend to have buyer's remorse but I can honestly say I have had no doubts or second thoughts.

177,"April 01, 2016","2 visits, stay tuned for the second visit.  I'm looking to replace my leased Cadillac with a leased Genesis.  First visit, they showed me a fully loaded Genesis, the most expensive one (55k) for 1,000 miles, it was top of the line and had things I did want or need so I asked them to give me a 48 month lease price on that car and on one optioned as I would like.  They returned with a 48 month lease on the loaded car and 42 months on the one optioned as I wanted it, so the lease on the fully loaded one was less money than a car costing $8,000 less.   So I left.

Second visit, I stopped in with my wife for her to drive.  This time they had a car on the lot optioned as I wanted, but in a color we didn't like.  We drove it, my wife was impressed.  And asked to get a 48 month lease quote on the car, Guess what, the lease price on this car $8,000 less than the loaded car from the first visit and the lease quote for 48 months on this car was HIGHER than the original lease price on the $55K car from original visit.
I said that was too high and he asked me where I wanted to be and I said $100 less, he said he could make that happen and I said, ""No thanks""  (The was probably another $50 that I could have taken off).  I walked out the door, before I got to my car another sales person and a ""manager"" rushed out to stop me and apologized for the other sales person and pleaded with me to come back in and they could do the lease for $100 less than I was quoted.  I said, no thanks.  I'm going to Austin.

If you're leasing you negotiate the selling price of the car and calculate the lease payments on that price, because that will significantly alter the lease per month and reduce residual value.

The sales person showed me the sheet and it started with the  full MSRP, added tax, license, document fees etc and then in big  red letters had Red McCombs discount $4,500.  A lot of people get suckered by that.",1.2

286,"May 23, 2012","I must say I am very satisfied with the work that is done at Red McCombs Superior Hyundai I had a great sales person, Anthony Speller who went out of his way to assure me that I was going to get the vehicle I wanted. I not only got the vehicle but most of all he got the monthly payment in the range that I was looking for. Because the first car I bought from him was such a success, I just recently bought my second from him! Thanks for making each time a wonderful experience for me! I would highly recommend anyone out there to purchase a vehicle to go and ask for him. He is one of the few out there that will take the time to go over everything to make your vehicle purchase a success!!",5.0
287,"May 21, 2012","I went to to Northside ford to look for a new car and they tried to talk me into a monthly payment of $485. I told them more than once that I did not feel comfortable with more than $400 a month, but they did not listen. Than I went to Red Mc Combs Superior Hyundai? and Mark Hanna was my sales person that worked with me and got me a monthly payment that I felt comfortable with and I was treated great. Did not have to jump through a lot of hoops and got what I wanted and could afford. Which is very hard to do when you have bad credit not not much of a downpayment. It was a great experience.

288,"April 17, 2012","I have purchased 4 cars over the years at various dealerships in both Texas and California and I will say hands down that I had the best experience buying a car at Red McCombs with Mark Hanna. From the Test Drive to the time that I took off in my new car, the total experience lasted no more than 3 hours. Mark made this the easier experience ever. If I ever decide to get another car, Mark and Red McCombs will be my first choice. ",5.0
289,"January 12, 2012",My husband and I made this our 4th dealer to visit-we regret that we didnt make it our 1st-the customer service we recieved was like no other-there's always a fear of buying a vehicle especially because we didnt want to be faced with the sales tactics that most dealers have. We were very pleased with the way we were treated-the things we were promised to make the vehicle look pristine were complete-and the price was just what we were looking for. If your looking for a used car I highly recommend you visit this dealership 1st that way you can enjoy the rest of your day in your new purchase-trust us we are most completely satisfied with Erbin and his team!! ,5.0
290,"October 01, 2011","I visited Red McComb's Superior on a Thursday during my lunch hour looking for a Tucson Limited.  I looked for used model first and found none to my liking with the assistance of Salesman Ray Lopez.  Mr. Lopez then took me over to new cars and showed me two different models but both were black, personally, black is a no-no in south texas.  I asked if they had other color's available in or around the San Antonio area, which he responded he would gladly check his sources.

After a few minutes of checking in the San Antonio area and around, they located a Graphite Grey in Kyle, Tx.  I was elated, better yet, Mr. Lopez drove to Kyle that evening to pick it up.  The following day I went into the dealership early and my future vehicle was sitting there awaiting ME!!  

Went through like a breeze and within 30 min. my vehicle was out of make ready with a full tank of gas!!!  Mr. Lopez gave me the run through on the basics of my new vehicle and I was out of there.  In all it took about 2 hours from start to finish that day.

Talk about good CUSTOMER SERVICE!  In my book if you don't have that essential element of Customer Service, you don't deserve my business!!  I'll be back for my future purchases at this location.

Keep up the good work Superior!! 

Sincerely,

NSL",5.0
291,"July 20, 2011",All I have to say is do your homework & prepared because they will use all kind of mental gymnastics to screw you. They preyed on our lack of mobility & ended up with a vehicle my wife hates because they played bait & switch after paperwork had been signed. I pray you don't end up like us.,1.6
292,"June 13, 2011","My husband and I went to look at 2011 Hyundai Elantra.  When we arrived we noticed there were very few cars on the lot (probably less than 20).  The sales guy Vinie came out to talk to us. When we told him what we were looking for he said they had none on the lot but to come inside and they could see what would be coming in this week. We told him we wanted to know first what they would give us for our trade in (I already had done the research and knew exactly what it was worth. He asked how much we owed and how much it was worth.  I told him it was worth a lot more than we owed.  When we got inside he ""spoke with the manager"" and they just so happened to have two coming in with the exact two colors I had been wanting (yeah right) and for a $500 deposit they can get them in this week. I've had a bad experience with buying a car without seeing it first (purchased through military overseas car sales picked up in the US) and will never do that again. He then took my car back to have it looked at by the mechanic.  When he came back he stated the mechanic said it was in excellent shape and was surprized at how good it looked and the low mileage for a 2006 Xterra.  We waited for the offer to come back.  When they made the offer we were insulted by how low it was.  It was over $2500 less than the ""Fair"" rated Blue book value.  Both me and my husband said no way.  When he came back with the second offer was still below the fair trade value (keep in mind they said it was in excellent shape).  Next the manager came out and asked why we were trading in and we stated for better gas mileage, he further insulted our intelligence saying that is what everyone is doing and you won't find anyone trying to get SUV's or trucks now (this is TX, give me a break most drive trucks or SUV's we weren't born yesterday) but he would talk to Nissan and see if they can get a better deal.  At this point I told my husband we were done.  Was tired of being insulted by unfair offers and would rather go elsewhere. So when they came back with third offer (still $500 less than trade value) we left.  The mechanic was outside (we had never seen him nor he us)and stopped us saying where are you going I was just about to bump the offer up another $500.  To Late!!!Do not ever buy anything from these people. They will try and rip you off for anything they can.

I bought my new 2012 Honda Civic from Fernandez Honda and couldn't be more happier.  They offered right off the bat exact trade offer for my Xterra I was looking for and sold me just what I wanted.  If you are in the market for a new car go to Fernandez Honda and ask for Henry Perez.",1.0
293,"April 28, 2011","Dishonest people! Stay away! I wanted to buy a Hyundai, and got in touch with Internet Manager who agreed to match my offer from another dealer. Drove a long way to Red McCombs and the salesman would not talk to me. He passed me off to a succession of people who all acted like they had no idea what I was talking about. Also the showroom is dirty, messy and smelly. Don't even go NEAR this place! Hey Red, are you listening?",1.0
