Had oil changed and rear hatch worked on so that it would raise automatically.
Lift assemblies for rear hatch had to be ordered, therefore I had to return next
day for them to be installed.  Great job both days.",5.0

5,"April 19, 2019","Was lied to about approval amt so they could sell me the car they wanted to sell- not the car I wanted to buy- then they tell me it’s certified used and safe- brakes went out to the point of ruining the rotors 3 weeks after purchase- sold my husband a truck he didn’t want lying to him about the amount he was approved for to get him to purchase a truck they wanted to get rid of- they had to replace his breaks 2 weeks after sale and he still has major engine problems they say they fixed and they refuse to give him the documents to show what they did to it- they also promised to get him a different truck 4 times and at the last day before payment was due, they said they changed their mind and they can’t help him any further - when he wrote bad review on the site they threatened legal action against him- horrible place! Don’t buy here ever! ",1.0

8,"March 28, 2019","My hometown is La Grange TX. Whenever I need my car worked on, I always have La Grange Ford handle it, because I know they will be straight with me. I live in Austin TX, but if I took my car to a dealership in Austin, I am just a number to them. They always try to tack on a lot of extra work, because they're just trying to make more money off of each person. That's why I prefer dealing with my hometown Ford. And I'd like to give a shout-out to Grover, the repair shop manager. He is awesome!",5.0

12,"March 03, 2012","We drove 45 minutes (with a ford store three blocks away from home) just to do business with Ricky.  We called and worked everythign over the phone and when we arrived the vehicle was ready to go.  They were polite and professional and everyone from the general manager to the owner stop by to tell us thank you, something that has never happened at any other dealership we have ever been to.  They gave us the best price and the best service...worth a 45 minute drive!",5.0
