0,"June 26, 2020",I was able to make a deal with Clay Cooley Nissan without the run-around and trickery I experienced with other dealerships. They make sure you understand what you are getting for the price. Everyone I met from the sales associate to the manager were a pleasure to work with. Keith Clark and Roland Lynn treated me right and made our experience 5 star worthy!,5.0

2,"June 25, 2020","I would first like to say that I’ve never had such an enjoyable experience at a car dealership. Ok maybe when I was 17 when my dad bought my first car. LOL. The team is very knowledgeable, friendly, patient and customer friendly. Everyone from our salesman Pa, manager Oigene and the GM Roland. I didn’t even come in to buy a car. My wife did! But we both ended up in great vehicles! From sales to financing it was a smooth experience! Thank you Clay Cooley Nissan in Duncanville! Please stop by and give them a chance for your business you won’t be disappointed. 

We will also bring our vehicles here for service and will recommend this location our friends.",5.0

4,"June 17, 2020","I have never been spoken to so disrespectfully through anyone I've done business with!

Constant threats to have my car taken because THEY did not follow through with what they said they would. Then suddenly it's my responsibility to take care of it.

I left without any copies of the finance contract I signed. I was told that these documents would be sent to me via mail once the bank processed it.  I contacted them a week later, a month has gone by and still, nothing. 
Instead of calling (since that wasn't working), I decided to try texting and emailing so at least I could start showing that I HAVE been asking for my paperwork.
I was told the bank would be contacting my employer on a specific date to confirm my employment. The date came and went.  Then I get a phone call from David, 2 weeks after the designated date, saying that my employer needed to call the bank. He began pressing the issue and told me that if I can't fulfill that, they'll be taking the car back.  I explained that my job is on limited business hours so this request could not be followed until the day after tomorrow. He then proceeds to talk to me as if I'm not actually employed. I have never been spoken to like this in my life and as unprofessional as it is, I'm glad I have the text messages to prove it so you all can see what I've been dealing with.",1.0

7,"May 25, 2020","IF I COULD I WOULD GIVE THIS DEALER A NEGATIVE RATING!!!!!!!!!!!!

I currently Have a 2018 Nissan Armada,   Like it except two things, outdated technology and bad gas mileage.   However this dealer promoted 0% interest rates this weekend and reached out to ask questions about  2020 models, if technology had been updated since 2018, their advertised discounts on the vehicle I was interested in and the 0% interest rates.  Financially it would make sense to buy a new 2020 vehicle at 0% interest  vs. keeping my current vehicle at my current rate.   

I chatted with or spoke to 4-5 ppl over 3 days.  I even texted with a finance manager who verified the car had Apple Car Play and Also said I could 0% interest based on my reported credit score after they validated my credit score. I explained i will only come if these two items can be assured.  Which he did.   

Thinking I was dealing with a reputable dealer and getting confirmation on my deal breakers I went to the dealer.   Thats when I realized all the lies multiple ppl told me.   In fact, apple care play is not available on any Aramada even though their website specifically says other wise.  The lie is repeated on every individual Aramada SL and Platinum models in stock.   I'm Smart enough not to fall for their sleazy car sales lingo and after a lengthy conversation they admitted their website was wrong.   They know they are mis advertising their cars to get you to come in.  Then they asked what I was currently paying on my Aramada.   Again, Im smart enough Never to fall for this sleazy sales tactic.    Dont for fall for that trick,  you'll Get screwed. Its another way they try and manipulate you.  

Thinking a  0% loan on a 2020 would be a better financial move, I started talking price and financial Terms and they repeatedly lied again.   Suddenly the sales price increased from the online posted  sticker price online for the specific car I was interested in.    Their offer also didnt discount the car the same amt as advertised online.   More lies.   Next they tried to add a $2995.00  junk fee for the dealer to provide their regular day to day services you get buying a car. I called them out on every lie and manipulation.  On round three of negotiations,   I was now told 0% interest rate was not available on Armadas at all.   Hard to know where the degree of lying occurred here.  Either 0% is never offered on Armada's or they will only Give you 0% interest rate if you are willing to way over pay on a vehicle to the tune of $5-6K in my instance.  

Buyer beware!   I will never buy a car from Clay Cooley!   They  tell lies after lies after lies to sell over priced cars

Be an educated consumer.   Get approved for financing at a bank before going to dealer.   Make them itemize every detail About your deal before agreeing or signing anything.  If they tried to offer a deal with a piece of paper consisting of 4 blocks with their offer.  Tear it up in front of them.  Demand to have a formal
Line item detailed offer with all the specifics of the offer.   Sales price, discounts,   Any additional dealer junk fees they try to add, interest rate, term of loan, etc.     Then verify the sales price and discounts available against what is listed online for The specific vehicle ID number you want.  

Also, never answer their question about what you want your car payment to be.  Another sleazy sales tactic that will cause you to over pay!",1.0
8,"May 15, 2020","I arrived at 935 for a 10 o'clock appt.  There were 6 service people in various cubicles.  None were wearing masks.  The courtesy greeter was wearing one however.  A serviceman finally came out.  He did not introduce himself and was not wearing a mask.  I asked him if masks were required.  He said, ""No.  I haven't worn a mask since this whole thing started.""  I thought, ""He's bragging"".  So I politely explained to him that the mask was to help protect me because I was over 65 and had underlying conditions.  I then asked if he would find someone to help me who would wear a mask.  He went looking.  In the meantime, a salesman came out.  I asked if anyone at this dealership wore mask (he was carrying one).  He said, ""We all have masks"" as he proceeded to put his on.  I explained to him that I needed someone to help me who wore a mask.  He took off looking for someone.  At 947 the 1st rep walked through.  He still wasn't wearing a mask nor did was he accompanied by another service member who would wear a mask.  I was extremely frustrated.  I informed him that we would just find another dealership to help us.  ",1.0
9,"May 08, 2020","1 star for positive experience with responsive salesperson, no other stars due to deceptive practice.
Found a car for my college-age son on the Nissan CPO website.  That website listed a price, along with the statement that the ""Price includes all costs to be paid by a consumer. except for licensing costs, registration fees, and taxes.""   The cpo website connected me to Clay Cooley Nissan for the car, where I provided my contact information and received a response from a salesperson within 10 minutes.
I told the salesperson I would be purchasing the car with cash and my son would come pick it up.  I was informed that the price on the CPO website and on the Clay Cooley website did not include the CPO warranty, which would be another $1500.
No sale, a different car in the future for my son, and disappointment in Clay Cooley for this deceptive practice.  No knock on the salesperson (Julio Ramirez), he was responsive and polite.
EDIT:  Removing the link to the nissan CPO website as that apparently violates community guidelines.",2.0

11,"April 04, 2020","The salesman Chris was a joy to work with but be aware of the back end product roll in they do in financing. I did not give consent nor was I informed by David in financing or anyone about the huge 3100 dollar Ally extended warranty and 1100 dollar Gap insurance that inflated the price of a 17 500 car to 23,300. These products are optional, I called the Warranty company and bank who financed my car and I was told it was not required, it should have been explained and  they should have your consent before rolling it into price and just rushing you through the paperwork to sign. This is unethical and I will make sure I don't refer anyone else to this dealership and get the word out. Be aware people before you sign, I have to own this but not too late for you!",2.0

31,"August 12, 2019","Everything started right. I found a car for my wife online, filled out the interested information, loan application and Trade-In Valet forms all online. Our hope was this would speed up the whole process so we were not at the dealership all day. 

We arrived at the dealership at 1:00 with all the information. This didn't start out well when they told us they could not find our application. Next, the trade in amount they offered for our car was not even close to the Trade In Valet quote.  Next came one of the finance manager to tell us the price of the car. Needless to say, this was also not even close to the amount we saw online. An hour plus had now passed and we told the finance manager to forget it, we would go somewhere else. This of course caused them to talk more and come back with an offer a little closer to what we had planned. 

Now I ask, what about the financing, at which they tell me they have not even looked at yet. They said they did not have my information yet, which I had now given them twice. After talking about rates I decided it would just be easier to get a loan through my bank. I applied on my phone and was approved in minutes. 

Now, all we needed to do was sign the papers for the car and get out the door. Unfortunately, this was another hour and a half process. Four and a half hours later we finally drove away from the dealership. ",1.2

Make sure you check and see exactly what you’re used car comes with before signing the dotted line. Ours did not come with a  Key fob. Management is absolutely a joke they take your money and watch you off. I guess they are not concerned about returning customers because I most definitely will never visit another Clay Cooley dealership in my time. Finance is an absolute joke my husband had to go and find our finance in himself and actually have our financing company Speak to the finance department to get the ball rolling.

47,"May 30, 2019","Hands down worst dealership experience I have ever had. It’s been over 90 days and I haven’t gotten my tags or plates yet and they continuously give me a run around. Thank God my car was basically new because from other reviews it looks like their service is shoddy too. They added extra charges on my financing (was there for 8 hours and didn’t question it so that’s my bad but still terrible). They left me on hold for an entire hour. James “Shep” or someone else at the dealership used my name to falsely post a review UNDER MY NAME, even though I have a signed document saying they would do no such thing. I was told the person responsible no longer worked there but the website and social media says otherwise. Rae promised to be helpful but after saying he’d “talk to accounting” (and he had no clue about the issue and they’d recently had turnover so this can’t be his fault obviously (cue eye roll) but he was just yet another sketchy figure at this dealer) he then gave me a number to call accounting myself. (So much for being helpful and sorting it out with accounting yourself!) I finally got a copy of a receipt that they paid for my taxes as proof they’ve done SOMETHING, but two weeks later and I still have no plates. He says I should pick them up. No one has told me this and said when or where. And I’ve been promised they would be mailed to me since I have had to drive out to the dealership (45 min away) two times after purchasing the vehicle to get new temporary tags because I’m on my THIRD tag and it’s about to EXPIRE AGAIN. This is outrageous. I’ve been told someone from customer service and complaints would call but I’m not holding my breath. No wonder they don’t have a main office listed anywhere for Clay Cooley Auto Group — because I bet you people would be pounding their door with complaints every day. ",1.0

49,"May 20, 2019",Clay Cooley Nissan is a joke and rip off!! I took my car there to get repaired. Spoke with a very dry Antonio Holmes that was of no assistance with my questions or concerns. He was very defensive and cut me off with all my questions as if he knew it all. Once he told me what my issue was with my car I realized I already had that issue repaired at another dealership back in 2017. I pulled the receipt and verified that I was correct. Clay Cooley $317 for the same repairs the other dealership charged $181. SAME ISSUE. SAME EXACT ISSUE!!! ALMOST DOUBLE THE PRICE!!! Why the price difference? Why am I having to get this repaired again?? When I went to pick up my car I asked for a manager at Clay Cooley and he came out. Listened to my issue...walked off and brought back dry Antonio and walked off. Didn’t stay to see what was going on or if i was satisfied. I again stated my issue and Antonio went on to tell me has an excellent memory and would not listen to my concerns still. Still no manager in sight!!! Dry Antonio still on defense not listening to my concerns. I finally just paid it and left. Antonio didn’t even wait to see if I signed my receipt. Then when I leave I get a text asking for my satisfaction rating from 1 (Not Likely/Poor) to 10 (Very Likely/Excellent)....How about a BIG FAT goose egg 0 as an option???

55,"March 01, 2019","I took my car back to the lot I purchased it from due to the fact the transmission wasn't pulling properly and wouldn't catch up to speed at times. The finance company scheduled the appt. for a Thurs. morning at 9. I get to the location I purchased it as instructed to, and due to the fact it was still in my 30 days. From Thurs to Tues I got the run around. I had to pay for a rental car during this time to get back and forth to work because I  didn't purchase the vehicle from the new side. I picked up the car Tues and it ran a lil smooth but within the next couple of days it started to hesitate at certain times and you can smell fluid burning through the vents. I took the car to a well known transmission shop and asked if a NEW transmission was installed would it drive like it was driving. I was informed that no new transmission was installed and that they may have flushed the transmission instead. From Thurs to Tues they kept my car stating a NEW transmission was being installed. It's now 3 weeks later and I'm back dealing with the SAME problem as before. I haven't made my 2nd payment but yet there is a major problem. This company is sad. I'm thinking I'm just take my payment and go elsewhere and park their lemon vehicle back on their lot. They're too busy saying it will affect my credit if I do so....hmmm I beg to differ because I was sold a lemon and instead of fixing the problem they patched it long enough to be out of my 30 day warranty. I may as well should've went to Mega Motors for a healthier lemon if I money to throw away like I'm doing now. Run for the border do not buy here.",1.2
56,"February 03, 2019","Never deal with Jude at Clay Cooley. He was so misleading and wasted my time. He made me feel like a hostage because even though I asked him for my keys three times he continued to have me wait by giving me a new excuse. Wasted 6 hours only to find out that he was trying to sell my car on his own, apart from Clay Cooley and get me into a higher payment car. He even advised us not to pay our current payment on our car because it would be sold by then #Scandalous.   Now the only reason I found out was when I was doing my paperwork with finance there was never a mention of my car and they were trying to sell me the new car at a way higher price stating that both prices were in the contract just to realize it was never true. I wish there could be something done on the way they do business I wish nothing more than them to fail. They wanted me to sign this paper that they constructed to sell my car on auto trader or auction.

58,"January 25, 2019","After driving in over 600 miles from my hometown I purchased a 2019 Altima from them, because they offered my a fair price for my trade in. While signing the final papers with the finance manager, they persuaded me to buy a oil change package for $369, which was supposed to give me free oil changes for life anywhere in the US, including my local dealership at my hometown of El Paso. 
When I called Clay Cooley Nissan about 3 months later to inquire about the paperwork for the package, that I was promised to get in the mail, I was told that the free oil changes only applied at Clay Cooley Nissan and no where else. 
After getting the runarounds from Mo, the finance manager, who told me he would try to make the service national, or refund my money, he didnt respond anymore. I was then told that it would cost me $50 in order for the refund to be processed and would take up to 12 weeks. 
Conclusion: All the people involved in the sale knew that my hometown was El Paso and I bevlieve that I was deliberately tricked to buy the package, telling me it would be good in El Paso.

59,"December 20, 2018","UPDATE FROM MY REVIEW ON 12/20/18 BELOW:
If you are reading this review on DealerRater or Google reviews, I just wanted to update that nothing ever was done to correct the problem. Someone from Clay Cooley posted a response a month ago on my Google review. I have never seen a response from the dealership on my DealerRater review. 
My guess is they post a generic response to try and fool anyone reading these posts that they actually did anything. I just wanted to clarify that I emailed the representative from Clay Cooley, as the response from them indicated, multiple times and never once received any type of contact. 
DealerRater reviews do not allow for me to post any internal communications between dealers and customers or any personal contact information. If you would like to see their response as I have stated above, feel free to look up my Google review. Buyer Beware!


Unfortunately our experience with this dealership has been terrible. Below is the email I had sent into the dealership trying to give them an opportunity to make things right before posting this review that they asked for via a text message a couple of days after purchasing the car.

We bought a pre-owned 2018 Altima SR with only 1500 miles on it from your location on Saturday November 17th for our daughter. We had been shopping around and a sales rep helped us. He called me and let me know about a car that may be of interest to us. We discussed it and after going back and forth a couple of times, he asked us to come in and see if we could make a deal. We live in Plano so I specifically text messaged him that we had a deal as long as the only thing extra was TT&L with no dealer add ons. Unfortunately, when we got there and spoke to him he brought us the buy order and it had the title and license fee at more than it should have been by roughly $310.00. At that moment the rep didn't know why but finally after asking around it was for an ELO GPS system that this dealership adds on to every vehicle. That along with a major gash in the rear spoiler really didn't sit well with my wife and I. The sales rep texted me two pictures of the car but never mentioned the spoiler damage. I just feel that knowing we were driving that far to look at it he should have mentioned it. To me that would have been the right thing to do especially since you were already lying about any dealer add ons. I guess if you are going to lie and be deceitful about one thing, then two or more things is just par for the course. 
 
It isn't anything major to get upset over, but since we received a text request for a review on Google and wanted to give you an opportunity to contact me to see if you want to make things right before I give my fair and honest review. We were/are easy customers. We are both educated buyers and have A+ credit. This should have been a really quick and easy deal. However, we came in at 5:15pm and didn't get done with finance until 8:15pm. There was a lot of just sitting around waiting. In our opinion three hours from start to finish seems entirely too long.
 
Furthermore, another sales rep (who was helping our main sales rep) was suppose to call me on Monday, November 19th to go through the setup on the ELO GPS system that we know nothing about and nobody could explain past what it did. He was also suppose to get us some pearl white touch up paint. It is now Monday, November 26th and I still have not heard from him or anyone. As of today (December 20th) nobody has still called to explain this system that I don't even want.
 
Lastly, we took this car out of town for the Thanksgiving holiday and it rained one of the days we were in Houston and the windshield wipers didn't work and the front radar system alarm and light came on showing a malfunction. This is a Nissan certified car so it is a little concerning that the windshield wiper motor and radar sensor malfunctioned already. On a good note I want to give credit to Jason in service at the Galleria location as he took my call, listened to my issues, scheduled me for an appointment the next day and informed me I could get a loaner car paid for by Nissan since the car is under the original factory warranty. I didn't even know you could get loaner cars with non luxury brands. He was excellent and I wanted to mention him in my overall experience so far. Again, just to clarify, he works at the Galleria location not the Duncanville one.

I will further add that a service manager named Ray Christian did finally call me but only after I had called into Nissan Consumer Affairs to file a complaint. That isn't Ray's fault. Ray was nice, and in my opinion, really was trying to help. However being nice and wanting to help isn't enough. He couldn't do anything to solve my issues. I asked for a credit for the ELO GPS system and I wanted them to fix the spoiler. Ray said they could not help with the credit for the ELO GPS system and would try to help with the spoiler. We talked on December 4th and we discussed that he would be in contact with me by the 10th or 11th. He did not call me until the 14th and only left me a message. I responded and left him a voicemail and an email and I haven't heard from him again. 
 
I have tried numerous times to contact your dealership since we bought the car. I left a message through your website messaging system on Tuesday, November 20th and a voicemail to two different extensions at your dealership between November 26th and 28th. The extension I was sent to were 2023 and 2011. Those were the extensions the receptionist connected me to on both occasions. I never received any contact.
 
As far as the big gash in the rear spoiler, I understand that the car is used (2018 with 1500 miles so not heavily used), but the combination of the above issues is what makes for this bad experience. I just wanted to let you know our issues and experience. We understand that sometimes things happen and that nobody is perfect. For us it's a matter of how you respond to us once we make you aware of the mistakes. We never received any response from the dealership until I called into Nissan Consumer Affairs. Then we never received any follow up or resolution. Lesson learned.

They definitely have room for improvement.",1.6

I had a totally different experience with the Service Manager (Ray Christiansen). I was upset after the violent interaction with the sale managers, so I told Ray ( the service manager) to give me the keys to my vehicle so I could leave. He said, ""don't leave because I want to make it right"". I told him the only thing that can make it right is for Clay Cooley to pay for the repairs to my vehicle that should have been done before I bought it. Ray said, ""leave it here, let me see what I can do"".  So I left it,  about an hour later he called and said the repairs were been done at no expense to me.  Thank God for people who do care. ",4.2

So then, I waited and waited,, finally someone calls, and say they will pick up the car.  After waiting til the end of the day, I went to the dealship, to realize no one was coming.  Then have a manager tell me to go deal with my issues across the street, finally got someone to come and at least call and get them to pick up the car.   Then when I called back and asked can I be notified on the card condition etc.  I was told by a manager , I can’t do that.

66,"September 03, 2018","If I could give them a negative star rating I would, and here is why....Last weekend my elderly grandmother (WHO HAS RECENTLY BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH ALZHEIMER'S) got an advertisement in the mail that said, ""Come on down and see if you are eligible to win a free car."" Being a naive and mentally unwell 81 year old, she followed the flyer's advice and went down there to look into this contest... A few hours later she drove off the lot with a brand new car that these xxx holes sold to her. Let me again point out that my grandmother has Alzheimer's and is not in anyway capable of making sound financial decisions, Anyone who spends more than 5 minutes with her would be able to tell that she is not completely aware of what is going on at any given time. So instead of being a decent person and sending her on her way these people instead take her for all she is worth and sell her a top of the line band new car with all the bells and whistles and -of course- all the extended warranties and fancy upcharged xxxxxxxx packaging. These guys had her sign a contract to pay back 47,000 at $750 a month over 6 years which is WELL beyond her means. When we went in to the dealership the next day to talk to them and explain that she is not in her right mind they tried to tell us that a deal is a deal. Finally, after a heated discussion with the manager they agreed to reverse the deal after we brought in documentation from my grandmother's doctor stating her health condition....All of that being said this is the type of people that work at this dealership. So yeah if you want to buy a car from someone who preys on the sick and vulnerable then Clay Cooley Nissan is the right dealership for you. ",1.0

I was sold a car that was suppose to have 36 miles but after I signed the agreement and got in my car it had over 3000 miles. This of course messes with my warranty when I brought it to Jason attention the next day he was oh well to bad there is nothing we can do.. The paper work even said 36 miles...I do believe this is fraud. The total price for the car was more by the time (all day) I was finally taken upstairs  to sign the paper work. When I brought it to Alex attention I was told to take it or leave without the car. My credit is being reestablished after bankruptcy so I felt a little trapped and very intimidated. I should of walked away. I will never stop telling people to go some where else.",1.5
68,"August 01, 2018","This dealership is full of liars !  I dont even know where to begin.  Went in to purchase a 2018 Rogue.  The 1st time I was at the dealership I spoke with a lady salesman that was clueless.  even went as far as to tell me the extended warranty on Nissan cars was 5 yr/100 k miles.  That is even incorrect.  I ended up getting angry and leaving.  After I left I spoke with Brad Hawkins, he stated the lady was fired because she was dumb as a box of rocks.  The next time that I went into the dealership I took my husband in with me to purchase the car and bring it home with me.  We were at the dealership 3 hours and got absolutely nothing accomplished.  Finally Veronica stepped in and took the bull by the horns and started getting things taken care of.  When she brought us the preliminary paperwork on the car the sales price was like $2500 over the listed price on the internet. I told her that would not work.  Needless to say Alex (from finance ) came out and said for us to take car and come back in 2 days and he would have everything worked out and ready for us to sign.  Needless to say we had been there almost 3.5 hrs and my husband was about to explode.  I left with the car and kept calling Alex every 2 days and asking if he was ready for us to come sign papers.  He kept making up stupid excuses as to why he needed 2 more days.  Long story short, I called him on the 10th days (which happened to be 7/31/18) last day of the month.  He told me to come on there and he would go over everything with us and close the deal.  We went up to the dealership after we got off work.  The real ""xxxx show"" began !  The problems started when we FINALLY got in the finance office.  They are only willing to put the car (which mind you I have racked up 1000 miles on and have drove for 10 days ) in my husbands name.  I had asked Alex the specific question 10 days prior if the car would be listed in both our names and he said yes.  That was the 1st lie !!  Then he got the sale price listed to 22k when there are SEVERAL Rogue's like mine on their internet for sale for 21k.  When I questioned Alex REPEATEDLY about the internet price, he came up with some xxxxxxxx on a computer screen that showed they are losing like $2500 on this deal just to make me happy.  I told him he was full of xxxx and I was not happy !   He came out with some xxxxxxxx about the Nissan Customer Cash ($2000) and Rogue Bonus Cash ($500 that was listed on the internet.  He said I didnt qualify for that because I didnt finance thru Nissan.  He is a LIAR !!!  The internet even list the ""cash price"" as 21k.  After arguing with him about it till I was blue in the face, Alex refused to change the price to match their listed price on the internet.  After my husband finished signing all the papers he came outside to the car.  They sent another salesman out to see If I had any questions about the car.  I told him I had been driving the dang thing for 10 days already  and that I had no questions and was just ready to get the xxxx out of their !  They only have given me 1 key to the car, they have seemed to have lost the other !!!   IDIOTS !!!!   In the process of all this happening, another  salesman walks out and starts talking to the man that I had just went off on.  They start starring at me talking.  That was rude as xxxx and made me even madder.  I walked up to him asking if he had something to say to my face about me.  He started to ramble some xxxxxxxx !!!   I am done with this dealership !  They are all a bunch of liars !  They have no desire to give any customer service !  They use deceptive pricing practices on their website !  CROOKS  CROOKS  CROOKS!!!!   Don't go to this dealership unless you just like to get screwed over and have terrible customer service!!",1.0
69,"July 19, 2018","I needed a routine oil change and booked an appointment at the service center.  Upon arriving on time, I was told that it would take 1.5 HOURS to change the oil.  It took over 2.5 hours of waiting in their barely air-conditioned waiting room even with an appointment.  I received 0 updates for the duration of the 2.5 hours. 

To make things better:
- One of the male workers talked to me like a car having two different air filters was unimaginable for my Y-chromosome lacking brain. I told him I knew that cars had multiple air filters for different purposes. He continued talking over me.
- A sales man made the mistake of trying to get me to lease a new car.  Both the look of disappointment when I told him that I own my car and the curtness of his questions was not appreciated when I was trying to work from the waiting room.
- I filled out the paper work when they said it would be ready, but surprise! It was going to take another 7 minutes to wash the car.  It actually took 15 minutes.  As an added bonus their version of a ""really good job"" for washing is almost as disappointing as everything else about this dealership.
- I was told I would receive a ""report card"" to fill out about the service (thankfully the male same male work that explained the air filters to me decided that my feminine mind couldn't grasp the word ""survey"", so he kindly broke it down to the term ""report card"" for me). I never got an email with the survey. When I messaged the dealership online for one, I received an email about buying a Nissan within about 15 minutes. 

I would rather drive extra and either go to the Arlington dealership or go elsewhere for routine maintenance.  Based on what I saw, the dealership seems like it's hurting for business and has some questionable business practices for leasing/sales. The service center employees for the most part seemed like they'd rather be elsewhere (as I would also). ",1.6

71,"May 24, 2018","As a recent graduate I decided a new Jeep was a great gift.  I am an advocate of Nissan and wanted to give my favorite brand a chance. I researched and decided a Nissan Rogue was the best fit.  Despite a rough previous experience, I decided to return to where I purchased my last four Nissans, Clay Cooley Duncanville.  An experience that should have been fun and exciting could not have been more unpleasant. Every single person I dealt with at this dealership either told intentional lies or failed to listen to my expectations. I arrived at the dealership to have my 2014 Altima serviced which was another issue. I decided to look at the Rogue as I waited for my car. My salesperson showed me model then I asked for keyless entry.  I had papers from online of the desired car but was told that the Capital One prices and online finance prices were made up for the model I really desired. The Sales manager and salesman kept going back and forth so that I was confused to which model I was really dealing over.   Needless to say I never saw the mysterious other car that fit what I was looking for nor did I get any pricing till in financing.  At one point my car in service was ready and I wanted to go over to check on it because there was an issue. Salesman told me “don’t worry about it.  We will take care of it.” The uneasiness in my gut should have been an indicator that the experience was getting worst. I asked to get pricing for both cars to compare but was told “financing would go over this”.   Financing is too late I thought.  Then I even said I would come back on Saturday but was told my om could cosign over the phone. HUH!!!  I asked repeatedly about my car in the service area and was told “no problem I would be able to get it.”  Joke was on me because I found out that Service was closed and everyone was gone.  My only vehicle was locked away with my keys. UPSETTING and it went way worse.  Then the sales-manager said we will go over the payoff check s but he was gone before I was ushered into the finance office. Three hours later I was in a financing room with my three kids and husband, no car and signing papers for a car that was missing features. I admit that I was worn down, hungry and distraught.  I could not even leave the dealership if I wanted to because my car was locked away. I called my salesperson less than 8hours later to be told that nothing can be done.  Also told come get your old car whenever you can. I felt that if the employees in both New Sales and Service Department would have listened this would have been a better experience.  I have been faithful to Clay Cooley Nissan and have sent a few family and friends to the dealership. This experience along with the last few visits to the service department have changed my perspective. I should have read all the reviews. Happy Graduation to me I messed up!!!

We wasted an entire day there on a transaction that shouldn't have taken more than a couple of hours at most.  The vehicle is great, but then our issues with the service department started.  Truck had an issue from the beginning - no big deal, but service department continually blew it off.  Only really looked into it when it was pointed out that we had talked about the same issue enough times that we could invoke the lemon laws if we wanted to.  Finally get some traction - no communication from service after dropping truck off.  Husband goes by dealership - find his name and the paperwork is completely wrong.  Several days later, husband calls to find out what is going on and discovers his truck isn't even at that dealership any longer - it's been moved to a different service center.  No one thought we might want to know that.  People answering the phone talk over you and are rude.  Actually told my husband that their communication with him has been adequate, and refused to provide the name of the service manager.  NEVER go to this dealership.

80,"January 19, 2018","An experience that should have been fun and exciting could not have been more unpleasant. Every single person I dealt with at this dealership either told intentional lies or was incredibly rude. I got a reasonable deal, but every tiny detail about the experience was horrendous. Choose another location for your psychological well-being.

Firstly, over the phone, I was quoted a range I would receive for my trade-in, but this quote was not honored when I arrived at the dealership. I was given far below that. The quote was simply spouted off to me on the phone to get me in the door. A dealership should not give a quote over the phone if they will not honor it. The salesperson kept going back to the finance team to pretend to work out a deal, but this was only a tactic to waste my time so I would agree to the terms.

Secondly, after leaving due to the dishonesty, I discovered over the next few days that I was not likely to find a better deal on what I wanted. I begrudgingly returned to the dealership and agreed to the purchase. Once I agreed, they no longer pretended to care about my time. I sat for an hour waiting to sign the paperwork to finalize, while 7 or 8 employees sat around chit chatting. Twice, employees came out of the business office to ask me to sign a credit application “for tax purposes” so I would finance through them rather than through my credit union. (No one signs a credit application for “tax purposes,” so this was another lie: a small one, but a lie nonetheless.) They tried to insist, and I had to give a firm “no” twice. While waiting, I checked the car listing again online (what else was I doing while sitting in a waiting room for an hour), and I noticed the dealership had lowered the price of the vehicle I was purchasing since my original visit. (So I was about to pay more for the vehicle than the current price listed on their site.) Once I was finally asked to come sign the paperwork, I asked for them to honor the updated price listed on their website, and I was told a nonsense reason about why they would not do so. Lies on lies on lies.

Thirdly, several weeks after I made the purchase, I discovered my previous lender had not received the payout check for my trade. I called the dealership and was told the check hadn’t even been sent yet. Had not even been sent yet! I was given the excuse that they have so many checks to send that they only send so many per day. 

Fourthly, six weeks after I made the purchase, I had not received word about my license plates. I called, and the employee with whom I spoke (in an unnecessarily rude tone) explained that the plates had arrived a month and four days prior and were sitting there at the dealership waiting for me to pick up. No one had bothered to call me, text me, or email me to let me know about this. The dealership also had the wrong address in their system when they mentioned the option of mailing me my plates that had been sitting there for a month and four days.

Revisiting this experience in my mind makes my skin crawl. This was the worst business experience I have encountered, and the dealership should pay for my counseling sessions that I will likely need after this (sarcasm intended). ",1.6

90,"August 29, 2017","My Nissan broke down a few weeks ago and between then and now (roughly 3 weeks later) is the time that it's taken for me to be back in it.  When I first spoke with someone, I was told that once they figured out the issue he would get back to me with what the issue was, then if I chose to have the service done I would receive a rental while they worked on it, since the rental was covered in my extended warranty.  The next communication I received from Nissan (about a week and a half later) was a voicemail from the man telling me my car was ready.

I never received any communication about the progress of the whole ordeal.  In the meantime, I tried to reach out to him to get status updates, only to be met with holding music for half-hour increments, sometimes being hung up on, then calling back to be immediately sent to holding music.  In other words, I could not get in touch with the service professional at all.  When I finally did (another few days later), I was given some insight into the issue, but told that the true problem would not be fixed because of concerns with the warranty company.  I won't go into all the details here, but my biggest issue with this is the lack of communication between Nissan and me about my car.  I was forced to inconvenience others and use their cars while I waited because I was under the impression that I would have a rental...although I had to drive around for nearly 3 weeks while waiting.

Long story short(ish), the communication was absolutely unprofessional and unappreciated, and I came out of the entire ordeal with the greatest degree of satisfaction.  I will be reaching out to higher management to better understand their policies on customer service, because I'm not quite sure what was given to me.

I did show up for the test drive and told them I wanted the vehicle and scheduled time to bring my trade in back the next day.  I received multiple phone that day to make sure I was going to be in.  

I brought my car in and after they had time to appraise it, they immediately started with the sales manager, Ray, and the hard sell.  My first issue was the price of the vehicle was over $2000 more than the price listed on their Web Site.  Ray said this is because the car was ""certified"" and they was his cost.  But the web site has a different price.  The price i was quoted two days before when I test drove it was the same as the Web Site.   NOTE - At this point one should walk out.  I eventually worked out a deal, if they agreed to guaranty the battery - it was a full electric car.  This was actually written on the document i signed to get the deal.

I applied online and started getting emails saying they ran my credit and they had approval waiting for me. Once I got there we were set in a secluded dull office with no type of vibrant atmosphere. This was the tone they set. I gave all my documents to my salesman and he went to someone and came back and said we hve a vehicle for you. 1st no one asked what type of vehicle I was interested in or like. Then the pre owned vehicle they showed me was very dirty on the inside and smelled like smoke. I was thinking why wouldn't they detail the vehicle. The salesman told me if I liked it they would detail it for me. "" 2015 charger"" We go back inside and the extremely long wait begins 3hrs of sitting no offer of a drink not even anymore interaction from the salsesman. I'm sure it's because they have them on an all out blitz of attacking customers to hold hostage to force a purchase. Anywho they came back and this time it was the finance manager. He begins with a spill why the car wouldn't work but he could get me into a brand new Sentra or a used Altima. They brought around a Altima and at that moment. I was like hey let me get my keys to my car. I didn't want to purchase a vehicle anymore. One of the managers Angie held my keys hostage trying to force me into purchasing the Altima. Telling me how my car wasn't worth me keeping and etc. ""I have a very nice car"" but to her because it was 06 she was trying to imply that purchasing thier vehicle would be better for me. Then the finance manager comes out again smoking a cigarette while talking to me. For Clay Cooley to have a such big name it reminds me of a buy here pay here lot. So I leave. A hour or two later they call me and tell me they reworked some numbers on the charger and to comeback to sign the paperwork. I go back and I sign to pieces of paperwork I call my insurance switch it over to the charger. A hour and half later here comes another salesman or manager telling me that they messed up some numbers and the deal was put on hold. At this point I'm extremely frustrated.

When she returned the car, the front desk receptionist took the keys, contract and the car, only for on their ruthless employees to drop the car off in the darkness of night at her dad's house without notifying anyone and placed the keys in mailbox. Really? Who does that Clay Cooley gangsters that's who!!!

Now here's what else happened. We discovered a trunk full of shattered glass from what appeared to be broken windshield glass. Something else they did not disclose to her.

Needless to say...they can come pick the car up whenever they want to because we will NOT be paying not one note. After seeking legal counsel, we found out a little known fact that the car still belongs to these ruthless gangsters unless we pay the first note. 

Oh one last thing...we both purchased new 2017 vehicles from a nearby dealership that treated us like humans and offered the best car buying experience ever.

104,"March 28, 2017","Do not go to this dealership. They are one of the worst sales people and won't care for your time. I visited them around a week back when they did not had any good Nissan Altimas in their inventory and only a trade in appraisal was done for my vehicle.

But today when I saw three cars under my budget on their inventory, I messaged the sales guy Victor to confirm if the vehicles are available to see and test drive. I drove for around 35 miles one side in peak traffic hours just to get fooled. When I reached at the dealership, the guy started struggling for the keys and did not come back for around 45 minutes. Despite calling him twice or thrice, he did not pick the phone while I was waiting inside for him to pull up the cars. 

Now to my surprise, he comes back with only one key saying he doesn't know where are the other two cars. We went for a test drive when suddenly I realized the listing as well as Carfax showed the color as 'Red' for the car but I was driving a 'Black' colored car. Although the car was nice to drive and pretty from inside, but this came as a shock to me as I have a habit of trusting Carfax history. I asked him to run VIN Check or some other car history website to know if the car was involved in some accident and was repainted. He immediately called his Sales director who starting offering me 400-500$ discount on the car saying they messed up the car color while registering the title to the previous owner. The guy went on to explain me the data sources of CARFAX. Having worked for their IT Software, I know where do they get the data regarding the car history.

But the guy instead of offering me some viable options said if you are not ready to negotiate on the color, nothing could be done and shook hands to get rid of me. I felt badly treated as a customer. My odometer is up by 75 miles because I trusted these guys. ",1.0

Advisor proceeds to tell me that they can't tell me what's wrong with the car because they can't get it started! I swear to you I'm not lying. You mean to tell me that Nissan doesn't have a battery they can put on my car to aide in diagnostics? You "" Nissan"" a multi billion dollar corporation doesn't have a battery?

For a washing and an oil change.  I suspect this is how they get out of honoring their commitments, by making it way too inconvenient.

120,"September 28, 2015","If you are in the market for a car please DO NOT go to Clay Cooley Nissan of Dallas!!!!!! I went last Friday to Clay Cooley to get my tags because they called. I pull up there is woman picketing in front of the car lot. Turns out they sold her a lemon and won't fix it. One of the service men said her car broke down 3 days after she bought it. I tell the receptionist I'm there because I got a call saying my tags are in. Guess what? They tell me my tags were not in because my car needs an inspection!!! Wait what?! Ok, whatever...I ask for new paper tags because my tags will expire and they tell me they can't because accounting is closed. I get the inspection and leave. Now let's fast forward to this Friday. I get a call at 7:22 p.m. that my tags are. I just pulled out of my dad's neighborhood and I see flashing lights behind me. I'm not speeding so I'm like what are they stopping me for...you got it expired paper tag! I explained to the cop I literally just got a call that my tags are in. Of course he doesn't believe me so he start to questions me where are you coming from...in my head I'm like why but I answer the question. Anyway, he asks for my license and just my luck I can't find it. Ugh! He took my info and goes back to his car. I then call Clay Cooley. Ma'am I was pulled over because my tag expired would you please explain to the officer you guys just called. I gave her my name spelled it for her and all. Oh yes we did just call you can just tell him but by this point I'm nervous/irritated because he has not come back to my car...you have seen the news. He comes back I get a ticket for the license because everything else checks out. As soon as I'm done with this cop I head to Clay Cooley. It's less than 2 minutes away. I'm pissed with a capital P. Yes I did storm in and tell them they need to put my tags on my car. The receptionist asks for my name and I tell her. She asks how to spell it...I tell her really the same way I spelled it when I was on the phone with you 2 seconds ago with the cop...long story short they called the cops on me because I'm pissed, irritated, angry, and I showed it. Did a threaten them? No. Did i throw or break anything? No. Was my voice elevated yes.. general manager Matt Kusez refused to put my plates on the car. Sir I really don't wanna hear it just put the plates on the car because all of this could have been avoided if yall gave me the paper tags when i came last week. This dude then was like we are not your slave.... I told him SLAVE whoa I said nothing about slaves just put the tags on the car. I had had enough I went outside to wait on the cops. As I'm leaving out the door dude is like put the plates on the car. They come ask what's the problem...I start to speak and immediately they are like ma'am we are talking to him. 5 seconds later he asked me what's the problem told him I just got pulled over for expired paper tags and I want my tags so I could get the xxxx out of here. Do yall know the cop had the nerve to ask me why I didn't leave...I literally told him I needed my tags, they called cops, and the way things have been going I am not trying to shot. He asked me what's keeping me from leaving now I told him not a God xxxx thing and left....I did not know it is against the law to get upset with a business for not providing proper service...The whole situation could have been printed if they would have printed the tag last...and for all of you that are asking why didn't you get it done during the week because I get off work too late and the accounting department would still be closed!

121,"June 24, 2015","I purchased my 2014 Nissan Maxima New from Clay.  Since the addition of Lionel Valdez, I think the service manager, the level of service increased dramatically, from close to nothing to impeccable.  Even the attitudes of the other employees I have encountered is totally different and impressive.  My last visit for my 5000 mile oil change, the service attendant was warm, funny, and pleasant and Mr. Valdez addressed me by name.  This level of impeccable service has added incredible value to me, and I now look forward to my next vehicle purchase from Clay Cooley Nissan.  ",5.0
122,"June 09, 2015","I had just bought my 2014 certified pre owned 370Z at another dealer and dropped by Clay Cooley service about a tire light to set up an appointment.  They would not hear of me setting an appointment and took the car in right away to reset the light.  After getting the car home I detailed it and found a bad window seal and a plastic paint protector that had discolored.  I drove back to Clay Cooley and asked them about those items.  The service manager Kevin came over and immediately stated "" I will order them and give you a call when they come in""...NO HASSELS, NO COMPLAINTS....just ""Ill order the parts"".  Kevin personally called me a few days later to say the parts were in and could I bring the car in (as early as that day).  
So I took the car over right away, and dropped it off, they even gave me a ride home.  When I went back to pick up the car they had even fixed a minor rattle I had mentioned in my first visit (they kept it in the records).

I cannot say enough about this service department.  I have rarely gotten this kind of service and personal attention from any of my previous dealerships.  I have definitely found a home for the servicing of my car.  If I could have given Kevin 10 stars that would still not be enough to say how high I rate this service department.",5.0

124,"April 27, 2015","Went in Sept 2014 to do a trade in, the sales rep Debbo was the one to start the process. He was very rude, unproffessional and cocky. I was ready to call it quit since we could not negotiate a deal but they would nit give me my car keys. A financial rep talked to us and said we could trade the new truck in 6 months and get one with more upgrades if we closed the deal, still then I was ready to go. Finally got my car keys and got in the car. Another financial manager Jaime went outside asked what I wanted told him and he said ok and that he would buy dinner.  I agreed and said we could still trade the basic new truck for another one with more upgrades.  Drove off with new truck, couple of months later recv'd email stating I was able to trade in truck with same car payment more features and 0 down.  I was hesitant to go back because of our bad experiance but needed a truck with more features. Showed email and told them what I was told and they said that it was not true that i could not get that deal that the email didnt show anything and they tried to get me with a higher paymt.  I talked to the financial manager and he said the samething that the email was not true.  we argued about the whole deal and told him they do false advertising. He said he could have given me the deal but since i was arguing with him he would not negotiate. I told him i didnt want to do anything with his dealership and walked off.  Never again Clay Cooley!! They said they cleaned house firing many reps but they need all new employees, manager and general manager and even maybe a new advertising department.  This space is too short to actually state my whole bad experiance with this mediocre dealership. I have bought too many cars in my life and never this bad experiance.

131,"March 04, 2015","My experience at this dealership was horrendous! Although when I arrived I was quickly created, I had to wait a decent amount of time to view the vehicle I was interested in. In addition to this when it was time for the test drive I let the salesperson know that I was not very familiar with the area and would need a little direction. He agreed and assured me it was no problem, however while on the test drive he completely ignored me and spent the entire time on his cell phone with other customers! When we returned to the dealership despite his rude attitude I was still interested in the vehicle. When we sat down to negotiate price, he over quoted the list price of the vehicle. When I disagreed with him and showed him what the vehicle was listed for on their website he tried to make the argument that, that vehicle had been sold. Despite all this I attempted to negotiate price, he refused to do any type of negotiating, despite offering to pay cash for the vehicle that day, a guaranteed sale! His attitude was completely disrespectful and he acted offended when I offered him a little off the list price. I would not deal with this dealership, liars and cheats!",1.0

Service guy was rude and said that their department has lost $40,000 to people who claimed to have service plans when they didn't(not my problem). He said that if I wanted an oil change it would be $50, even though there were ads all over the place saying that an oil change was only $34.

Husband's car purchase - same day as sons, felt like bait and switch.  Gave us 4 cylinder when asked for 6.  Didn't realize until next day that was not what we had asked for initially.  Called immediately when discovered and said wanted to fix this, very unhappy.  Got different salesperson who said he was manager, found out later was not, said nothing we could do, paperwork already sent in (known lie) and made us pay additional money to trade in a car we had less than 24 hours for the car we wanted in the first place.

I told the one on my first visit that I was happy with my vehicle and didn't want another car payment at this time. He kept up his sales tactic, so I had to ignore him until he found someone else to bother. During my second visit, another salesman sat near me and started with the pleasantries. I immediately informed him I was not interested in another vehicle and I didn't want to waste his time. I guess he was offended because he got short with me.

141,"July 16, 2014","Initially contacted the dealer by phone on a specific car listed online. I was assured that the car was in stock and that all I would pay was the price listed plus TTL. When we got thereat about 1:30p, they ""couldn't find the car."" We waited about 30 minutes while they looked. Then we were taken to an alternate location where it ""might be."" It wasn't. I told the salesman to just sell me a car with the same specs at the same price. That's when he discovered that the ""specs"" listed in their ad were wrong. They had ""mistakenly"" listed an automatic at the manual price. After arguing this point, they agreed to ""give"" me the automatic at the advertised price."" Fine. Getting to this point has taken well over two hours. Then the salesman goes to see the finance manager and upon his return announces that they will have to raise the price of the car $500 to offer their special financing. At this point I am exasperated and leave the dealership. About a block a way, the call me and remind me that they have my drivers license. They had ""forgotten"" to return it to me after we took the test drive. Upon my return, my car is descended upon by the salesman and two other managers. They ask what they could do to earn my business. After reflecting for a second I tell them they would have to upgrade the car at no cost to alloy wheels and appearance package. I expected them to refuse, but they agree. We go back inside. In about 20 minutes, the salesman brings out the ""final proposal"" which I sign off on. I remind him that we had agreed to TTL and the price of the car, nothing more. He assured me this would be the case. We wait about another 45 minutes for the loan docs to be prepared. When we go into the finance office, I see a series of charges in addition to the TTL. Among the charges I understand is one I don't--a $199 prep fee. I ask the finance manager what it is for. His answer is--get this--this is something we charge everyone. I ask again what it's for. He cannot answer. He repeats it's just something we charge everybody. I prepare to walk again. He asks if I want him to take it off. I respond, ""Absolutely."" So at about 7:30p we sign the docs. Then we wait another 20 or so minutes for a lady to come out and explain the features of the car to us. At 8pm, we leave the dealership. So, having called the dealership ahead of time with a stock number and agreeing on a price, we walk out a mere 6.5 hours later with our car. We did end up with a good price, that's why I gave 3 stars. But, I'm willing to bet very few people do.

144,"May 22, 2014","     I recently tried to purchase a 2014 Nissan Sentra SR. I closed the deal April 25th 2014. I was suppose to receive equity off my trade in get cash back. I even had it written in the contract and on a we owe form. 2 weeks later find out the deal was not being accepted by lender. The dealership had messes up the paper work  the lender would not except the paper work or payoff money. Clay Cooley of Austin calls me back in and Micheal Corey General Manager and some other managers said the deal needs to be redone and I would recieve my money by the following Wednesday. I even came in a day earlier  to redo paper work so they could fund it. Other note they shook my hand and told me deal was done don't worry trust us.
  Wednesday the following week rolls around lender funds the deal have on my credit report dealership backs out of deal. They shook my hand promised me my money and promised situation would be resolved if just give them until Wednesday nope that was a lie. 
     Wednesday rolls around Michael Cory asks one more day it would get resolved have my money drive car happily ever after blah, blah, blah. Also they had me sign paperwork for electronic funding. I Come in Thursday they try to lower cash back 1200 dollars less at higher term even though deal is approved already.  
     Finally they get their car back hand me my car back apologize for deal not be funded. However the deal is funded I owe lender 26000 dollars approximately plus I still owe additional on trade vehicle. For over a week I have been trying to get them to refund lender for loan on car that  I did not get. Finally they fund money back 1000 dollars short so as of May 22  I'm still dealing with this nightmare deal. They have the car and the loan money. 
     Attempts to call Clay Cooley Nissan of Austin and call the managers has led to message machine constantly been full so I have to leave messages with receptionist. I have tried to be polite but how can my voice be perfect with receptionist when I have what I feal is 26000 dollars of stolen money in their possession and managers wont talk to me. Receptionist was very non caring to would not even take message so I could get off phone and was non concearned with my situation like this happens every day or some thing. 
   Eventually guy name Chris one of managers I think calls back say don't  upset receptionist  and  Chris leaves me number to call him like their mess up is my fault. He also promises on this Monday all money would be funded back to lender By Thursday. Thursday is todays date and not all the money is funded back on this loan for a car I don't even have. 
       Clay Cooley Nissan messed up or some thing up and paid the lender 1000 short so of coarse I'm stressed out. I'm just a working class fool trying to get my injured fiancée money for her injury and get her a car she can drive with more leg room and this is how I'm treated. I hope god willing they pay the rest of the loan back since they have the car. I pray they don't do this to some one else also.
    I try to be polite but scared to death I'm going to be stuck with loan and no car. This place is very old school and in my opinion dishonest. Shaking some ones hand and promising deal is done should mean some thing. Never use this place unless you want to be funded with loan payments and no car. NMAC has been wonderful on helping me to retrieve their money back. I have lost many nights of sleep over this dealership. 
    In my opinion and from other customers I talked to of Clay Cooley and his reviews. I feal Clay Cooley views his customers as 1 times deals and does not view them with a mentality of customer service first. Clay Cooley in my opinion does not seem to treat his customers with honor, integretity or any other concern for their well being. It is all your fault when they mess up Be warned my situation sincerely Stanza 1992. 
    I still view Nissans as wonderful cars and NMAC as a five star excellent wonderful customer service lender. I really believe the deal would not be funded back at all with out their help. My previous loans NMAC has been excellent to. Sorry to NMAC I trusted these people thought they were honest. I was duped.  My fiancée bought a prius at Auto Nation of Austin and they were awesome. If need an honest deal with lower then expected payments buy from Auto Nation of Austin. Totally painless deal with auto Nation Toyota of Austin. Do not use Clay Cooley Nissan or any other in my Clay Cooley services in my opinion. I usually love to give car dealerships good reviews so this is hard for me to do.",1.0

I was there through every step of the process.  When it came to him signing he was rushed to the back with only ""four minutes to sign his contract"", or he would not be able to drive home that night. Ofcourse, he wanted to drive his new car home.  I had to ask the contract guy to explain the contract which he had already begun signing when I ""found "" him in the back. By the time I reached him the finance part was signed and he was being rushed without explanation or having time to read the contract. I have the recording of the explanations he received.  Very unprofessional! I found out through my grandson he had signed to pay this amount the following day. I hit the roof. I called my brother who is a second time customer, along with his wife, and who recommended Clay Cooley.  He returned the next day with my grandson to ask for a refund or another car. They were given the run-around.  But, I and they are not finished. This will be reported to The Better Bisiness Bureau and to Consumer Credit Affairs for the state.  The whole process was deceptive. Don't even get me started on what I went through on the same day as I was promised a zero down vehicle and sent on an emotional Rollercoaster , only to leave without a vehicle and made to feel second class.

The problem was that the car had two dents on the hood very dificult to see at plain site, but while washing the car in detail i was able to notice them, so I contacted my sales guy, who has taken pretty good care of me, and told him about the situation. He told me to bring the car that they would take care of it, and so they did, they repainted the hood but it turned out that the paint job was'nt done right and it had tiny bubbles all over it. I took the car back and showed them the turn out of the paint job and they said that it would be done again, so they did, but now it has more bubbles. The point of all this is that i'm paying for a new car that has deffects not caused by me and every time I have to go there is a waste of time and now they're asking me to bring it during the morning so that I can show the painter the issues with the paint job. It is a new car I should'nt have to be wasting my time going to the delear, in this case it would be like the 7 th time, for this paint issue.

I couldn't even get out the car good enough before this shark with a retainer flagged me into a space. Clue number that he was a vulture. Any how, I asked if he had any used Muranos available. He of course started with a conversation about a new Rogue. Rogue? Did I say Rogue? Ugh! Then he stated that he needed all this information from me in order for me to even take a test drive. Which I found odd and intrusive. I had previously went to AutoNation Nissan where I live in N. Dallas; didn't need to do that I got my car fax info and price ranges and I was done. NO HASSLE!

Then he and out ask me as he sat me down..if he could get me the truck I wanted with a ""good price"" would I buy today? He stated that ""they"" get jerked around by customers a lot. I said no.

153,"August 16, 2013","I had the most DISTURBING AND HORRIBLE experience of my life with car buying at Clay Cooley Nissan in Desoto, TX on 08.14.13.  First they pounded on me like vultures when I drove on the lot, but when I left I was in tears.   I was PUBLICLY HUMILIATED in front of everyone in the showroom when I did not agree to the terms of a loan for a car I wanted to purchase.   I spent over 2 hours there with this cast of characters trying to force me into buying a car (they kept coming out the ""back"").  Granted I liked the car but still had to keep things comfortable for me.  We agreed on a price and I was ready to sign when I saw 72 written on the paper.  I asked the guy what that number was and he said the number of payments.  So I said no I dont want a 6 year note.  He goes off on this rant about how with my bad credit I won't get a 5 yr note anywhere.  Then he goes your the one with bad credit your the one that can't get a car etc. etc.  I had even said before all of his yelling that I would be back to look at another car and for them to call me if one came in that fit my budget.  He said NO this offer is for right now today only, you either take this or not.  I said fine, I won't.  And started to leave he then started telling EVERYONE in the show room that I was the LADY WITH BAD CREDIT!   It was a surreal experience.  He yelled at the guys behind the glass hey look there goes the lady with bad credit.   I have heard other stories about this dealership but I saw it first hand.   They were like the used car mafia up in there.  All the cheesy looking people.  The good guy, the bad guy and the ""boss"".   Funny thing is my credit was FINE until I said no to their terms.  Long story short.   I left and the next day went to CHUCK FAIRBANKS CHEVY and bought a car with a 5 yr note with no hassle and no force.

The sales team is friendly as long as you're there to make a purchase.  The service team is unprofessional and the finance team makes you feel of little worth.  What's strikingly odd..  I was approved and financed for the vehicle of my choice at the price I wanted.  But I was observant of customer service, or lack there of, with other customers.  Watched how the finance team disregarded those of non credit worthiness.  Even the service after I left and returned to complete other tasks was horrible...  horrible, horrible, horrible...

Like I said earlier, as long as you're credit wirthy or there to buy, they service is ok)

155,"April 04, 2013","Although it was a pleasure to be greeted by you again this evening at Clay Cooley Nissan, I must admit my second visit to your location was far less satisfying than my visit just 48 hours prior.  Salesman Ken Williams, myself, and Sales Manager Robert Spivey had a productive session on Tuesday night in which I drove a 2013 Nissan Rogue SV AWD. We agreed on a price of $19,900 plus TTL at that time.  And while I did not commit due to the fact that I had a few more cars to test, he informed me that it was ""relatively safe to assume"" that if I came back before the end of the week that your offer would be the same.  He even said ""Ken is my witness"". 

It is 54 miles round trip from my home to your location.  I have now driven that twice, despite the fact that there are much closer Nissan dealerships to me. I returned to CCN 48 hours later, check book and well qualified credit in hand, ready to buy.  I TOLD YOU when I came in that the $19,900 was the right price for me and Robert said ""Great! Let's do business!"".  I had decided on giving up the AWD and trading in my car instead of handing it down.  I settled on a car with Tim (Ken was apparently off) and was all set to begin.  Another sales manager came out (you were conveniently busy...starting to see a pattern) and told me that the lowest he could go on the SV FWD was $21,441 plus TTL.  What??? A car that has a sticker price LESS than the one I initially looked at is now $1,541 MORE than what we talked about? How is that right? Sayid (?) said ""you didn't take the offer on Tuesday and this is the lowest I can go"". Obviously, it isn't or you, Robert, wouldn't have offered me the $19,900 rate. And if you had just been honest (a huge leap for your industry, I am sure) that you were no longer able to honor that, I would have saved two and a half hours of my life---and Tim's, who was showing someone around without getting full commission.  When it came to my trade, he offered me $1,000.00.  I told him that part of the reason that I decided to trade in was because Clay Cooley offers a minimum of $3000 for ANY trade, ANY condition, drivable or not.  He asked me ""where did you hear that?""  What, again??? A sales manager who doesn't know their own ads????  Surely if Mr. Cooley spends the amount of money on ads that Tim says he does, your sales managers would be aware of what is out there. I told him a co worker saw the ad on TV and I called and confirmed it---in fact, the lady I spoke to offered $3500 as your minimum trade.  I quickly realized that Clay Cooley does not intend on honoring any ads unless the customer asks about it.

Cut to Tim, who is CLEARLY embarrassed because he knows you all are trying to screw me, now being asked to show me even LESS equipped cars in an effort to get me to the rate that you and I discussed. The sales manager comes back and says the $3000 trade in *is* correct, but he would have to INCREASE the price of the car (again) to compensate for the trade, and it would be better for me to take the $1000 trade and pay the $21,441.  I said, ""it would be better for you to honor what I was told 48 hrs ago."" His reply? ""I've never seen a price that low for this car.  We must have been desperate for a sale. We aren't desperate tonight"".   I am not desperate either, and I do not appreciate being taken advantage of.  You had a customer in your house ready to pay you $20,000 and you let them leave because you would not honor your word. What was it you told me on Tuesday?  Oh yes, ""we will not lose you due to price"".  I guess that was false too.

The only thing I was desperate to do tonight was rush home and pen these thoughts to you. Between Monday and Wednesday, I was not treated better by any other dealership.  You made the car buying experience fun, relaxed and seem trustworthy. This is part of the reason I came back.  Your dealership's complete turnaround two days later is the reason I walked out. 

Make sure you ALL ask about the trade in offer, and the fact that $19,900 really IS the ""lowest"" they will go on the SV AWD.  That way, if you are offered more, they can walk away too. ",2.4

163,"July 02, 2012","Mine is the tired old story of a car dealership pulling the ole switcheroo and trying to cheat someone (that would be me) out of hundreds of dollars. Salesperson and I agreed on a price and rate. I get into the financing dept. and am signing the mountain of papers to close the deal and notice that the rate on the paperwork is nearly three times the rate that I was quoted verbally (1.9% vs. just under 5%). Of course, they claim it is just a simple mistake, and then say that Nissan WOULD NEVER ALLOW them to sell that particular car with the 1.9% rate. If another dealer hadn't already tried to pull the exact same scam on me in the past, I probably would have believed the BS and given them the benefit of the doubt. But luckily I was wise to the scam. They tried and tried to sweeten the deal in some way to make me happy, but since I knew without a doubt that they had tried to screw me out of all that money, I was having none of it and walked out. (Oddly enough, they miraculously COULD offer EVEN BETTER than the 1.9% rate that moments before they said Nissan would NEVER allow them to do if I would only stay and complete the deal. The rate just kept getting better and better the closer to the door I got. Had I not understood how morally bankrupt what they were trying to do was, and that they had probably ""stolen"" hundreds of thousands of previous (and future) customer's money doing it, I might have turned back around, agreed and signed. I'm sure lots of people do. Than again, probably lots of people sign the paperwork without realizing that the deal they are agreeing to isn't the same as the deal that was verbally offered.) One salesperson even said to me, ""I don't understand why you are so upset. This happens all the time."" In other words, it's apparently Standard Operating Procedure at Clay Cooley Nissan to offer one set of terms in the verbal deal then produce paperwork that doesn't reflect it. My advice to anyone that considers dealing with the people at this dealership...DON'T. If reading my story doesn't scare you away, look VERY CLOSELY at your paperwork...read each document intently and find out for yourself exactly what you are agreeing to BEFORE SIGNING ANYTHING. I really liked the Nissan I was about to buy. But I would not consider putting even one penny into Nissan's pockets if this is the kind of conduct that is allowed (and probably encouraged) to go on at their dealerships. There is one thing I don't understand though...why is it a felony crime to steal hundreds of dollars from someone's home, car, wallet or purse, but car salespeople do it daily and walk the streets with no fear of legal repercussion?",1.0
164,"March 28, 2012","I took my  mother to help her buy her first new car in over 20 years, we had just visited the Dallas Auto Show and there were 4 cars (all different brands) that she wanted to test drive before making her decision. As usual, as soon as we pulled up we were attacked by vultures - but this happens at every dealership you visit - we ended up with a very nice salesman named Jeremiah. We were very upfront with Jeremiah that we were only there to test drive and that we would return once a decision had been made. Though he was not very knowledgable about the vehicle, he was very pleasant and that helped to ease my mother which in turn made me happy. After our test drive he wanted us to take a moment to meet with his manager - Mr. Sawfor (this is where the problem began). We also told Mr. Sawford that we were just here for the test drive and that we would return once she had driven her other 3 options. Mr. Sawford then asked what he could do to earn our business - I jokingly said ""sell me that car for $15000 (MSRP was 18,490) and I will be back with my husband to get it!"". Mr Sawford consulted a moment with Jeremiah in regards to the price of the vehicle as well as the trim package and the year (it's a 2011) - he then told me that if we still wanted to drive the other vehicles that he encourages it because he knows that their product is better, and that if I return that same day to buy it - he will sell it to me for $15000 and that includes TT&L. I agreed - Jeremiah hid the car so that no one else would buy it and my mother and I went to do another test drive. Mr. Sawford was correct - my mother thought that their product was better than the others, however it was now 8:30pm and Clay Cooley was closing for the night. We called Jeremiah to let him know that we would be by first thing in the morning to buy the car.
Day 2 - My mother, my husband and I went to Clay Cooley *cash in hand* to buy the car. Jeremiah once again was very friendly and he set us up with the financial guy to work the numbers over - long story short Mr. Sawford was brought in to ""verify"" that we did indeed have an arrangement - and Mr. Sawford says ""no ma'am, I said 'what if' I could get you the car for $15000"" which is not at all what he said and Jeremiah knew it, but was too afraid to speak up (this I understand, it would probably have meant losing his job). Mr. Sawford told us that Mr. Clay Cooley himself was here today and that Clay Cooley would fire him for selling that car so cheap -- of course as he is telling us this Clay Cooley walked by talking to another staff member about the helicopter that he was fixing to buy. 
Basically it was all a bunch of lies to get us back -- I understand that car dealerships are typically this way -- but I purchased my Nissan a year ago from Don Davis Nissan and had a wonderful experience with no lying involved.

As soon as I told them that I would give them a check for full payment, you would have thought it was all wrapped up.Just sign the papers and go, right,  No, for some reason, they decided it would be a good idea to keep us at their dewalership for 3 unnecessary hours.  During this time, they let us ""test drive"" the vehicle, but failed to check if it had any gas in it, which it didn't, so we ran out of gas less than a mile from the dealership.

Upon our arrival back to the dealership, they asked aabout our trade-in, and insulted us with a less than blue book offer for it, and then while they made us wait, they came back 3 times with addditional offers which may have been less offensive, but nowhere neaz the value of the car (another waste of my time, and once again I had to confirm how much I love my daughter to continue).  Oh, and sometime during this continued waiting period, they decided they needed to run a credit check on both my daughter and me, even though I had told them this was a cash transaction. The word DUH comes to mind and once again, they really played on my love for my daughter.

Brandon was extremely helpful in helping us find the best financing deal for our purchase. I plan to make my next purchase from Clay Cooley and I will be sure to ask for Keith.,5.0
178,"June 25, 2011","To Whom it may concern,

I arrived at Clay Cooley Nissan at around 13:00 on Saturday June 11th 2011. I worked with Salesman Dereck West and finalized financing for a 2011 Maxima. Prior to accepting delivery and leaving the Dealership; I discovered several major scratches on the top right trunk area.

I informed Larry Crop and Gus Magriff of this problem; I was assured they would in good faith have these scratches removed at no cost to myself. Larry was going to call me and arrange a rental next week. 

I took them at their word being in good faith; that’s the only reason I accepted delivery of this new 2011 Maxima and took it home that night. 

Larry called on Tuesday June 14th and made arrangements for a rental vehicle for Thursday June 16-2011. I arrived on June 16th around 18:00 and Larry had the rental car ready. I was loading it with my things and Larry’s manager Matthew Crusak steps in. He said we can fix this right now and asked me to wait. I asked how long it was going to take? “Matthew said about thirty minutes”. I told Matthew/Larry that I would get something to eat and come back. When I arrived back at the dealership; the scratches were still on my vehicle and very visible. I told them this wasn’t acceptable and I expected them to honor their word and have these scratches removed. I was asked again by Matthew/Larry to give them an additional thirty minutes. I went home and received a call from Larry about one hour later 20:00. Larry claimed the scratches had been removed and asked me to come back to the dealership and pick up my vehicle. I arrived back and discovered the scratches were still very visible and hadn’t been removed. Again; I told Larry this wasn’t acceptable and I expected them to honor their word and have these scratches removed. Larry said take the rental home and we’ll get it fixed tomorrow Friday June 17th 2011. I’ll call you tomorrow and let you know we’ve finished you’re car and that you can pick it up. 

Larry called about noon and I arrived back at the dealership on Friday June 17-2011 around 18:00. I discovered the scratches were still very visible and hadn’t been removed. Again; I told Larry this wasn’t acceptable and I expected them to honor their word and have these scratches removed. 

Larry went and got his manager Matthew and asked him to come outside and discuss the issue with me. I was shocked and disillusioned when Matthew started yelling at me like he was disciplining a two year old child. “There’s nothing else we can do but paint the entire trunk; repeat what I just said”. Again, I told Larry and Matthew this wasn’t acceptable and I expected them to honor their word and have these scratches removed. Matthew put his hand on my shoulder and tapped me twice as he walked away.  Shouting; “I’m not going to do anything and you have the car as is”. Larry then turns to me and follows Matthews lead and says; Gregory there’s nothing else we can do and you have the vehicle as is!!!!

This was an additional insult; my physical space was invaded by Matthew putting his hands on me and touching me in that inappropriate manner. 

Matthew’s manager Gus Magriff came outside and I explained the issue with Matthew and Larry. I reminded Gus of my showing himself and Larry the scratches on the night I took delivery. Gus had given his word they would have the scratches removed. Gus said; Gregory we’ll properly get this issue resolved, give us tonight and keep the rental. I then received a call on Saturday from Dereck around 13:00; stating they’ve had the scratches removed. I arrived back at the dealership on Saturday June 18th 2011 and the scratches were finally fixed. 

This was a very unprofessional manner in which I was treated; after choosing to purchase a new Maxima at Clay Cooley Nissan. The fact that Matthew is a manager is at best a poor reflection on this dealership and ultimately Nissan.  

I’ve been asked by other co-workers and family about where I’ve purchased my new Maxima. Based on my experience dealing with Matthew and Larry; I’ve not been able to recommend any of them visiting Clay Cooley Nissan. The likelihood they too would be subject to this same type of unprofessional treatment and talked to like a child and touched in that same inappropriate manner. I’m sure others have been treated the same way by these two; but not all customers will follow-up writing about their experience. 

Disregard the names may be misspelled; based on the spelling I was given by Dereck West.

Clay Cooley Overall Rating: D
Dereck West: Excellent=A
Gus Magriff: Excellent=A
Larry Crop: Poor=D-
Matthew Crusak: Negative Poor=F-Minus

179,"June 18, 2011","I have worked with kevin for several years I have always had the best service experience possible.  I appreciate the fact that kevin always informs me on what is taking place with my vehicle.  Kevin has never tried to sell me something that is not needed on my vehicle. In fact if their is a repair needed and he thinks it can wait he always leaves the option to have the work done up to me.  FYI, if Kevin leaves my service goes with him.   ",4.8

Floyd McGriff has been my salesperson for my last three vehicles. He is ""Great"".
He makes the sell go very smoothly.
The employees in the service dept. are so helpful and friendly. I keep all my
aervice appointments. Love to coupons.
Kudos to Mr. Clay Cooley. Love the location and his friendly greetings when he is at the dealership.

182,"May 28, 2011","This was supposed to be an Internet sale.  After going to Edmunds.com and listing the vehicle my wife and I wanted, several local dealerships were listed.  We began receiving emails from these dealerships.  One of which was Clay Cooley.  I received an email from Dawn Riggs and an email from Brittany Tatum, who I later found out was her assistant.  I sent no less than five (5) emails and received no less than five (5) emails stating that they had the Nissan I was wanting to purchase.  I specifically and repeatedly asked them if they were talking about the Nissan Xterra Pro 4-X and was assured that it was.  One of my last emails to Dawn and Brittany I stated ""just so I'm sure we are on the same page,"" and I again asked if we were talking about the Xterra.  The response I recieved from Dawn was ""Hello jesse,

Goodmorning,yes sir we are on the same page that is the out the door price now we are just waiting on you to set up a time to stop by and meet up with me and dawn.Please let me know we are here until 9pm....
Sincerely,

Dawn Riggs""

So, off to south Dallas county we drove (driving from Denton county) and as we drove my wife decided to call Dawn and ask just one more time if we were talking about the Pro 4-X.  And of course she said yes.  Once we entered the dealership, Dawn came out and greeted me (my wife had gone outside to look at an Xterra).  She made a feeble attempt at covering up her obvious lie by telling me she had made a mistake and showed me a piece of paper with a hand written amount on it ($3,000 more than what she and her assistant had quoted us on the Internet (several times)).  I told Dawn that I would go and get my wife and that we would probably be leaving.  My wife decided it was time to speak to a manager.  Dawn tapped some person on the shoulder on the showroom floor (not sure he was even employeed at the dealership) and told him that we wanted to speak to a manager.  After we tried to explain what had happend, his only concern was that ""we could'nt possibly sell that vehicle for what Dawn had quoted and that they would try and get as close to that number as possible.""

We left the dealership feeling cheated and lied to.  MY WORD OF WARNING IS THAT NO ONE SHOULD BE TREATED THE WAY WE WERE AND NOT TO DEAL WITH CLAY COOLEY AND ESPECIALLY NOT DAWN RIGGS OR BRITTANY TATUM.  The will lie to you just to get you in the door and then change the whole deal, or try to, any way.

I would highly recommend Bankston Nissan of Lewisville, they are straight with you and courtious.  NO LIES.",1.0
183,"May 25, 2011","They went above and beyond, not only to get me financed but to get my payments to an acceptable amount. They made sure to show me several options available and let me make the decision that would best suit me. They made sure to quickly take car of everything promised on the we owe sheet and I can say that everything on the sales side left me very satisfied.
The only complaint I have is that we were only given one key and told the other would be with our plates, which we have not received yet.",5.0
184,"May 20, 2011","Upon calling and speaking to Kevin Shutter, I told him what the problem with my vehicle was and he asked me to bring it in at my convenience. Not only did he arrange for it to be taken care of, he also arranged for me to be put into a loaner vehicle so that I would not be inconvenienced. When I arrived, Joey Martinez quickly attended to me and made sure that I got into the loaner within a matter of minutes of my arrival. Joey kept me apprised of the status of my vehicle throughout the entire process and made sure that I was okay with everything.

This was a great experience that went very smoothly!",5.0

187,"May 18, 2011","The entire team at Clay Cooley were professional, curteous and highly motivated to provide us the most fair deal they could. I was treated extremely well and did not once feel like I was being pressured, lied to or manipulated like I did at two other dealerships I was talking to.

What a breath of fresh air in what is currently a challenging car market. I understand inventory is shrinking and many dealerships are holding back optional incentives to make as much as they can on every car they sell.

I'm sure Clay Cooley made a profit on my car but I compared the deal they gave me to another dealership and a very popular independent leasing company in Dallas and only after I told them what the Clay Cooley team gave me were they willing to match the Clay Cooley price.

TOO LATE BOYS! The Clay Cooley team earned my business up front and also gained a enthuisastic and loyal customer. Thank you Floyd, Larry and Rene, you guys rock!",5.0
188,"May 18, 2011",Great people to deal with and everyone treats you respectfully.  I had great service from the initial test drive until I decided to purchase the car.  I would recommend them to anyone interested in buying a car.  I will start here when it is time to replace my other car.,5.0
