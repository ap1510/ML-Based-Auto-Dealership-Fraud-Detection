0,"June 16, 2020","Purchased a used 2014 Acadia Denali with 80k miles on it for my wife on a Tuesday night during the end of the pandemic. Next morning it had red fluid under the car! So I immediately called Tony my salesman and he was off that day but I took it in anyway but was too late and service was closed. So next day Thursday I took it in and talked to Tony. All he said was ""We got you brother, we stand behind our sales. We gonna fix it."" They did fix it, no charge at all! It was the power steering pump but he said if it was even the transmission they were gonna fix it. It did take until Tuesday to get the part in and repairs completed but worth it.",5.0

2,"February 26, 2020","I’m back.... life is a strange trip and things happened where it made sense for me to get into a new Subaru too. My wife is loving her Touring but I didn’t need all of the glitz, which is impressive. I found a very nice 2020 Outback Premium in their stock, with more bells and whistles than I needed. I made what I thought was a negotiation starter offer and they accepted my offer. They gave me a very good trade offer. I was treated great by my salesman, Sultan, the Sales Manager Tony and the Finance guy Kip. If your not keeping score, that’s 2 outbacks from Hiley in 2 weeks, both outstanding deals and service. I would recommend to anyone looking for a Subaru, the folks at Hiley. I’m 65 years old and have bought a good number of cars and also helped friends and family buy cars. Hiley folks were professional, realized this wasn’t my first rodeo and treated me as such and did it with good humor. No dealer has been any better than the folks I dealt with at Hiley. Good folks, good deals...",5.0
3,"February 18, 2020","I worked with Sultan. He was responsive, friendly and wasn't trying to hustle us into anything. We drove an Outback (twice) that afternoon and left it at that. My wife decided the Outback was her favorite of all the SUV's we had driven that last 3 or 4 weeks. I called Sultan, made an offer and he said he would call back...  which he did shortly after we hung up. Offer accepted. We showed up about 6:45 that evening to pickup the car, it was all cleaned up and under cover (raining like crazy). He got the key to my wife so we could drive it and make sure all was well, it was. Got the paperwork done, met with the Finance guy, signed the papers and were on our way home by 8:15. They would get a five, if the had just given the car to me :-)...! It was a good experience and everyone we dealt with was helpful and pleasant. Would not think twice about dealing with them again.",4.4
4,"February 09, 2020","I just purchased my fifth Subaru. The last three have been from Hiley. For sales, I recommend Michael Lamarr. He’s knowledgeable and patient. He always has time to answer my questions and if he doesn’t know the answer, he doesn’t stop until he finds it.
The service department is great! Lauren and Taylor have gone above and beyond to make sure all of my needs are met.",5.0

6,"November 11, 2019","Horrible dealership.  Completely unethical business practices.   I called and spoke to one of their salesman about a used car they had for sale.  I agreed to the price and left them a deposit.  He sent me the purchase agreement and we were all set to close on the purchase.  Being out of state, I made arrangements for shipping the vehicle to me, banking arrangements to pay for the car, etc...  
Fast forward to later that day...I called up asking for my salesman and the receptionist hung up on me...ok, that's strange.  So, I called back and...she hung up on me again!  What's going on here?  At any rate, I called back again and left a message for the salesman to return my  call.  Guess what?  No return call...   Finally, I just called the salesman on his cell phone and still no return call.   Finally, I got a call from someone else at the dealership telling me that they sold my car to someone else!  Mind you, I left them a deposit and they sent me the purchase agreement.  What kind of business practice is this?  Totally unethical.  But what can you say...  They are car salesman.  Shady by nature and never to be trusted.  When you make a deal on a car...a deal is a deal.  You don't go and sell it to someone else, especially since I left them a sizable deposit.  Just know that this place is shady and their word and your deposit mean nothing...    Take your business elsewhere...",1.0
7,"September 13, 2019",RUDE RUDE RUDE.....Absolutely the WORST EXPERIENCE. We stopped by to check out their Acura RDX 2019. The sales guy was really rude. He wasn't really interested in showing us the car. After we did the test drive we liked the car and almost made up our mind to buy the car but their sales team were pushing us to finance the car from them which was at a really high APR. We asked their sales representative to give us a sales sheet for the vehicle so we could get a loan from our bank to which he got pissed off and refused to provide us a sales sheet. On top of that he packed up all off his documents and simply asked us to leave. Me and my friend were shocked by the kind of treatment we got. I'm never stepping foot at their dealership again in my life. Avoid these rude people if you don't wanna get embarrassed. ,1.0
8,"September 12, 2019",The vehicle itself is not bad but the dealings from this place are horrible. I was told and shown a clear carfax only to find out it was wrecked and not reported. Asked my sales person about the tires on the car and was told oh they don't cost much. You would think they would place decent tires on a vehicle they are trying to sell. Car was also marked up quite a bit different from what was priced online.,1.6
9,"July 30, 2019","If I could no stars I would...

No need to make an appointment because they won't honor any time constraints....went for a job that should have taken 30 minutes it took over and hour ... and they quoted one price then it come out higher ...they did lower the price but that's not what I'm really mad about... my time is valuable and these people wasted my time!! this literally should have taken 30 minutes ...unacceptable",2.0
10,"April 23, 2019","I just picked up my car after 6 days of waiting for a part that never came with no ETA for when the part will arrive. Supposedly washed yet there is dried bird poop on the hood, dust on the windshield, and grease all over the rims. No communication. Constantly having to call for updates, and never getting the requested call back. Horrible. Absolutely do not go here. ",1.0
11,"March 29, 2019","I purchased my Subaru BRZ there and everyone is always smiling.   The problem is that everything I was told turned out to be a lie.  I was given a ""discount"" that magically disappeared with ""add-ons"".  I asked to do my own financing and please do not have a free for all on my credit by doing hard inquiries.  I found out a day later they did 7 hard inquiries and lowered my credit score 40 points.  I was in the fiance room for 45 minutes saying over and over again I did not want the extended warranty.  I finally gave up and said yes just to get out of the room.  I came back later and cancelled the extended warranty.  That was 8 weeks ago.  I have made numerous calls and keep getting blown off.  The ""credit"" they say you will get when you cancel does not exist.  They are crooks and con men who smile all the time lying and deceiving you.",1.0
12,"March 19, 2019","Had a good buying experience here 4 years ago, but the dealership has gone downhill since then, and the service department is a _mess_. Service is difficult to schedule, and the advisers have tried to sell me 'service' I didn't need more than once. Both understaffed and understocked with cars, Hiley Subaru screams 'go somewhere else' to its customers. Happily, I brought my car Subaru to Five Star in Grapevine, and if I buy another Subaru, it'll be from them. For now, I'll drive the extra 35 miles up here for service instead of driving to Hiley, which is five minutes from my house. ",2.0
13,"February 15, 2019","If you go to Hiley of Fort Worth ask for Mike. He's patient, kind , knowledgeable and I believe, honest. Hard to find these qualities when looking for a car. I might have found a little better price shopping around but with Mike I know I got a good price with a firm I can look forward using in the future. As to the Outback, this is our first experience with subaru. Looks like we are going to be in love with it for a long time. We passed over some high class SUVs but when you conciser safety, comfort, style,and overall economy our choice was clear. Happy trails",5.0
14,"November 02, 2018","My wife wanted a Honda, not really interested in anything else.  After a bad experience with on Honda dealer and an awfbrutal experience at Vandergriff Honda, I talked her into looking at a Subaru. She loved they way Hiley treated us.  Totally transparent and up front, great experience!  Gary did a great job, found the perfect model and gave us simple up front pricing.  Jeff, the sales manager was great too.  They are dog friendly too, which strikes a cord with us.  My wife loves her new vehicle and is already telling her friends.  These guys get it, we both preferred the Subaru & the Hiley experience.  No games played here! Do yourself a favor and at least give Subaru & Hiley a shot.  We are elated that we did.",5.0
15,"October 04, 2018","I bought a truck from hiley Subaru and the first week I had it it started to shake so I took it back and they said they had fixed it now 4 months later it starts having the same problem again so I take it to a dodge dealership and they said the whole fronted is bad meaning the  steering column, racking pinion and they said how long have you had it i said 4 months they said well you need to take it back because they sold you a bad truck that it souldnt have been put for sale that to fix it will be $3500 I went to the dealership and showed the manager the estimate and he said sorry I’m not going to pay to fix it you should have bought an extended warranty with it to cover your back and says good luck. never will buy a car from them ever again sell bad cars.",1.0
16,"September 24, 2018","Went in to Hiley Saturday, was greeted by BB who showed me the truck I was there to see.  He was great, no pressure, took me for a test drive, even showed me the ""rough road"" to take to see how it handled.  All done, even got my trade evaluated and all in a short amount of time.  Signed the deal and was out in just over an hour! (ok maybe 1.4)  THANKS!  PS Love the TRUCK!   Just be sure to enjoy working with a great salesman . Thanks BB😎",5.0
17,"August 16, 2018","Please do your research on car buying before you buy a car, saleman will suck every penny out of you if you let them. Hiley had a pretty good selection so we tried them out. We definitely didn’t get the family oriented vibes when we walked in, they wanted to know what occupation we were in, fishing to see how much money we were worth. They refused to sell us the car that we came in to buy. Then proceeded to go thru the purchasing process (running credit checks and trying to approve loans) on multiple different cars to see what we could and couldn’t get approved for I guess. As they were doing this, the loans were $20,000 over the price of the car. We just walked out pretty frustrated, didn’t want to have any part of that, and went to Subaru of Plano. We had really great service with Subaru of Plano. They were pet friendly, family fun, and didn’t wait at all. They gave us the car we wanted. We purchased the 2019 Subaru Ascent Touring. THEY DIDNT TRY TO MILK US FOR ALL WE ARE WORTH, and couldn’t ask for anything better! ",1.0
18,"August 10, 2018","Bought a used car warranty for 2500 it covers very little and requires a 100 deductible.  Dealer made it sound like it coves every and anything. I have had other problems with them too. 

This was the final straw 
Seevice check out girl Courtney qouted 1900 on the phone. 2300 due was the amount when i went to pick up. I will never try to use this dealer for any subaru repairs or purchases",1.4
19,"July 07, 2018","50 something female. I am looking at used veh. No one shows. I go into bldg. no one speaks offers to help. I go back outside and researched veh. Go back inside. Several salesmen around a couple male customers. No eye contact, no one speaks. Finally flag down female employee. Went to buy and expected to be compensated and the price quoted was a joke. Will buy elsewhere. Never again. Husband drove up and they met him at his car",1.0

21,"December 01, 2017","I towed my Subaru to Hiley for service because it was overheating. After a 1500.00 repair bill my car started to overheat before I got home. I had it towed back and now I’m told it will be several more thousand dollars to repair my car. They are unwilling and refuse to refund our money even though they never fixed our car. 
UPDATE *
After talking with Jerry I was issued a full refund on the cost of repairs. Jerry was a great help; he was honest and understanding of my situation. If I could rate the service and experience on his help this would be a 5 star review. ",2.2
22,"August 12, 2017",BB Bellharrat was very helpful.  He helped us understand how to use the car features. We could not remember how to use the driver assist technology.,5.0
23,"April 25, 2017","I was not intending to buy another vehicle for several months, but I saw a truck on line that seemed too good to be true.
I stopped by Hiley on a Saturday afternoon, and was immediately greeted by ""BB"".
very friendly.
From the start there was no pressure, only helpful advice.
I was shown the truck, and as fast as we looked it over we went on a short test drive. I expressed a few little things that I would have to have addressed, and he assured me that it would not be a problem at all.
they offered me a fair trade amount for my vehicle, and a competitive finance rate.
I got a call on Monday afternoon, telling me everything I wanted taken care of was done, the truck was detailed, gassed up, and ready to drive away.
Gary Ogden in the pre-owned department was helpful in seeing this through, as well as Marcus, and Kip in the finance department. 
It is not enough to say how instrumental me sales man ""BB"" was to me in getting this deal through.
I would rate this establishment as top notch in my life experiences, and I'm 60  years old, and have been to, and worked at a lot of car dealerships in my life.
the service after the sale has yet to be experienced, but if it is anything like the initial contact , I am sure it will be a pleasure as well.",5.0
24,"March 13, 2017",We called to inquire about a 2013 Dodge Challenger on Thursday of this week. Saturday of the same week we were able to go to the dealer in Fort Worth and pick car up in a matter of about one hour. Some of the nicest guys I've ever dealt with. Gary went above and beyond to help us. I will send anyone I know to them. It is very comforting to be able to make a phone call and then just go pick up your car plain and simple most excellent service thank you guys for everything!!! By the way we love the car I've barely been out of it since we bought it. LOL,5.0
25,"January 09, 2017","I agreed on a price with sales manager. I calledto confirm again on way to dealership.  Sold truck to another man infront of me.  I had cash he was financing.  The manager is garbage, no morals, no ethics!!!!!",1.0
26,"December 31, 2016","Thanks for helping us get into a great Subaru Forester 2014.We especially appreciate your respect for our time and getting us in and out without spending a whole day at the dealership.Thanks again!

27,"September 12, 2016",We rather not go in to any details. Just a bad experience and learning lesson for everyone involved. Won't go back there again ever! Gave this poor rating and if you look at this post they changed it to 4.4 stars! ,1.0
28,"September 11, 2016","I had never imagined car buying experience can be so simple and easy.  Trey Moss is the guy who made it happen and his mission - ""Make car buying experience painless and easy"".  He really lives by it.  My conversation with him was 5 minutes.  Asked him the best offer and he came close to my price and said if you are going to come today you can have the car.  Went there and was out in 30 minutes to get my paper work done for financing.  That went through smoothly and got out of the dealership in 1hr.

Trey Moss is the guy who made it happen.  He is fun and most patient with all the questions.  He answered every question we had including my kids :)...He was very respectful to all of us.  

Highly recommend this dealership and particularly Trey to anyone who wants to have a painless car buying experience.",5.0
29,"September 08, 2016",I recently went to Hiley to discuss a new vehicle and had the pleasure of dealing with Trey Moss.  He was fun & energetic as well as knowledgable and helpful.  I choose a 2016 WRX and the guys down at Hiley have done such a great job both through the sales portion and the after sale customer service.  I highly recommend them if you are in the market for a new or used vehicle! ,5.0
30,"July 16, 2016",Exceptional car buying experience! BB did a wonderful job helping me to find a great Subaru at a fair price. This was an easy and relatively fast process. The finance person was also very friendly and worked hard to get me a great interest rate. I highly recommend both BB and this dealership!,5.0
31,"July 11, 2016","To the extent that the car doesn't sell itself, my purchasing experience at this dealership was incredible. Our salesperson, Trey, was extremely knowledgeable and able to thoroughly answer all of our questions, both about the car and purchasing options. He was also just genuinely fun to be around. In the end, we left the dealership in the car we wanted on terms that worked for us. We never felt pressured to make any decisions, and we never felt like we were getting a bad deal. We had a 100% positive experience, will recommend the dealership to all of our friends and family, and will most likely return for our next vehicle purchase!",5.0
32,"April 16, 2016","that you love.  Last month I had to travel to North Carolina and asked Michael Lamar what
I should do about the oil change that would be due when I got there, he said, go to the
nearest Subaru there and they will honor the free oil change and tire rotation.  I did and the
dealership there wasn't aware of the free package.  I called Michael after having no luck talking
to the employee there and Michael made him aware of the special and stayed on the line until
they realized Michael was correct thus saving me several dollars.  Michael's knowledge and experience on Subaru's makes him an outstanding salesman, I would recommend him to anyone that is interested in buying a new car.   It's a wonderful experience when you know you have a salesman that you can trust.",5.0
33,"April 16, 2016",Trey Moss made my experience at Hiley Subaru a great one. There was no pressure to do anything I was not comfortable with and communication was consistent and to the point. I would absolutely recommend dealing with Trey for your next Subaru purchase. He was very helpful and accommodating in getting the process done quickly and professionally.,5.0
34,"April 04, 2016","I was one of the few who know what it was I wanted, but finding a Subaru that I could afford was the challenge! I contacted Hiley Subaru and was contacted with swift details by Trey Moss. My work week is busy and spare time is hard to come by, but Trey was willing and ready to work with my schedule. Within only a few hours I was out the drive in a brand new Crosstrek! Couldn't be more pleased and excited about my new vehicle and everyone at Hiley!",5.0

36,"January 22, 2016",We had purchased a 2016 Subaru Legacy. Trey was very friendly and made us feel comfortable. There were no hard sell or pressure tactics as are typical with some car dealers. We found that very refreshing. He also was knowledgeable about every aspect of the car and he was very patient with us with all our questions. He was prompt in returning our phone calls as well as E-mails. Almost felt as if we were friends by the end of purchase. Everything went smoothly. He told us if we have any questions or concerns in the future we can call him. We feel confident he will stand by his word. We highly recommend buying a car with Trey at Subaru.,5.0
37,"January 05, 2016","Recently we purchased a 2016 Subaru Forester from Trey Moss at Hiley Subaru.  It was the seventh time we have purchased a new vehicle, and this was the most hassle-free, straight-forward car buying experience we have ever had.  Trey was very knowledgeable on all details and was very patient when answering our many questions.   The Forester is a great vehicle!

38,"October 12, 2015","Bought a used car from here a month and a half ago. Had to have a part replaced, they ordered it, and sent it to us (we are 3 hours away from them). Seems great, right, but the sent it with insufficient postage and no return address so it couldn't have been even sent back to them that it was insufficient postage. So we had to pay just to get the part they promised us. 

As this came up my husband called the Subaru manager, was told that he was not in and if he would like to leave a voicemail, which he did. Stating very clearly that there were some issues going on with the sale and being sent a part COD. Left name and phone number....that was a week ago....still no return call.  

Will not be returning......There's enough Subi dealers around DFW that I am sure would take better care of their customers.",2.8
39,"October 09, 2015","Dave is an excellent service manager and always ensures the job is done right. Prices are comparable to other well trusted local shops and I know I am having someone who knows the intricacies of the subaru engine do the work. Most dealerships are stealerships but this one is not. No pushy overpriced services and they are friendly to do it yourselfers.

 The parts guy Tommy is top notch as well. He's always friendly and willing to help with odds and ends.

I bought my car here and will continue to have it serviced here.",5.0
40,"September 09, 2015","I would like to write a long review on how great of an experience my wife and I had at Hiley Subaru but I'm sure that most people won't want to read a long drawn out thesis about our experience.  Long story, short...We had a wonderful car buying experience there.  My wife, who did not know much about Subaru before going, was sold on the cars and how well we were treated.  Trey Moss was very friendly and patient as we went back and forth test driving cars and explaining the differences.  He understood that this was a big purchase and was very understanding that we didn't want to jump into any car.  We wanted to make sure it was the right one for us and probably test drove 5-6 cars in one day at Hiley.  Jeff, the sales manager, was very friendly.  He came out and talked to us and addresses all of our concerns.  The only thing that took us so long at the dealer, was trying to decide between the Forester and the Outback.  They gave us a great price on the Forester and a more than fair offer on our trade without us having to haggle too much.  If you are looking for a Subaru then do yourself a favor.  Go to Hiley and ask for Trey Moss.  I would send my mom to buy a car from that guy. ",5.0
41,"August 04, 2015","Based on positive reviews here and on Yelp, I contacted Trey Moss to test drive the Legacy and Forester. He proved a responsive, knowledgeable, and personable salesman. He was accommodating (I went back a couple of times before ordering a '16 Forester) but never pushy, and (mercifully) never pulled the squirrelly numbers game that many other dealers do (Mac Churchill, I'm looking at you). This was an easy, no pressure transaction, and I'm happy with the car so far. I would buy another car from him, or recommend him to a friend/family member with no hesitation.

The dealership itself is a bit of a mess--busted and mismatched furniture, computers so outdated they work intermittently and slowly, sales floor and offices are crowded, etc. I've not worked with the service department yet--they don't get particularly high marks below, so I may be looking elsewhere for that. So, I'd say 5 stars for Trey, about 2 1/2 for the dealership's facility, and a big ? for the service department. ",4.5
42,"June 21, 2015",Took in a 2015 Crosstrek for its first oil change. After they returned it to me I popped the hood to discover excess oil around the filter and the caps left OFF the radiator overflow and windshield washer reservoirs. Neither were topped off by the way. For the icing on the cake they left a nice greasy handprint on the headliner from when they placed the service sticker on the windshield with incorrect mileage for my next oil change. ,2.2

44,"May 05, 2015","This is the worst place to service a Subaru in DFW. I was having an electrical problem with my new Legacy. I took it to Hiley Subaru to have it checked out. The service adviser was friendly and addressed my concerns to the mechanic. The ""lead mechanic"" told me everything was normal and there is nothing they could do to fix it, so live with it! After researching forums online, other owners told me it is not normal and to try another dealership. I then went to Sewell Subaru of Dallas where they took me seriously and found a TSB for my issue.

47,"December 03, 2014","I just bought a new Subaru Legacy from Trey Moss.  It was the easiest car buying experience I have ever had.  After finding the one I wanted in their inventory, I sent an email and Trey responded the same day.  I emailed him about the availability of the car (they sell quickly) and the price since I was looking for something comparable to USAA pricing.  He sent me a quote that was in line with what I expected.  A few days later, I went out to the dealership, drove the car, and took it home two hours later.  It was great!  Trey was very friendly and answered all of my questions.  John in the finance group also got me through the paperwork as quickly as he could.  I would definitely buy from these guys again!",5.0
48,"November 20, 2014","The first time I spoke with this salesman on negotiating a price, he asked assertively why I wouldn't take his first offer because its better than the price where I am from and I simply said I wanted it lower. I declined at first because I felt pressured but later on decided to buy from him when he called me back and was able to get an approved lower price. 

Later on, I was told that there was a key with lock buttons that belonged to me and it is on its way to me in the mail. When I did receive it, I explained that the key was straight edged which would not fit in my car. He wasn't sure about why it was like that and asked for me to mail it back.

About two months later of no updates, I called him and He told me the key was made like that by the manufacturer and that he will send it back to me. He collected my VIN information so the key is programmed and all I needed to do was get the shipped car key cut like my car key at my local dealership.

Upon doing that, I realized that the buttons on my key didn't work, so I called him about it and he told me I would need to have it programmed here locally. I would have to pay for the programming and mail the receipt to get reimbursed for the fee and shipping by Hiley. I expressed my frustrations with him and he apologized for it all, but it didn't seem genuine. He told me when I pass by in fort worth I can get my car detailed or receive freebies.

After a few days that I have mail expressed the key receipt, I call him to see if it was received and he said he is sick. After a week of mailing it, I'm told the reimbursement is on the way. Two weeks later, I check up with him on when exactly should I receive it and he doesn't know. So I call the accounting department and was told that it was sent three days ago and that the reimbursement amount was only the fee, not the shipping included.

Finally I talked with the manager to tell him this issue and expressed my frustrating experience with the salesman. He was able to have my reimbursement for the shipping mailed to me, however he did not addressed or followed up with my concerns with Drew. 

In conclusion, I do not recommend this dealership due to not feeling like a valued customer after having bought my car. I would have been better off buying from my local dealership from friendly, charismatic salesmen than the Hiley Dealership regardless of price.",1.2
49,"June 27, 2014","My wife and I had a terrible experience here.  The Young salesmen were very rude and condescending despite having less knowledge about their new product than I had.  After a grueling process of proving ourselves financially to a teenager (For a Subaru, really?) they ""allowed"" us to test drive the car, which they later brought up as a bargaining chip later on, which is the funniest/saddest thing a dealer has ever tried to use as leverage in a negotiation with me.  Once they finally/reluctantly agreed to honor a price they put on the table earlier in the negotiation that we agreed to, we put our names on the car and came back to the dealer the next morning to purchase.  (Bare in mind: we left the dealer the night before as they were turning the lights off)  When we woke up the next morning (before opening) the salesman texted us to ""come pick up our brand new car!""  So we made the long drive out to the dealer to be told the car had been sold after we left, the night before, by the manager, despite our names being on it.  We were understandably frustrated.  Their fix was to find another one at another dealer.  They frantically searched to find one, and did, in Dallas.  A new manager (the one that had sold the car would not show his face and hid whenever I looked over) flew into the room with paperwork on the other car and pressured us to sign.  When I wouldn't sign anything without seeing the car, he told us to be happy and trust them.  The other car was the exact same, minus color, and was $1500 more.  I told him I wanted the same price and to see the car.  He raised his voice at me that I was ridiculous for thinking that was possible and left the room.  In the mean time, I called the other dealer to discover that car was sold two days prior and NOT TO SIGN ANYTHING.  The other dealer seemed to know good and well the capabilities of these crooks.  I gave them one more shot by asking them to honor the USAA price on another vehicle on the lot that was a little nicer.  The manager proclaimed ""I can't even buy that car for that price!""  Well, then don't advertise guaranteed USAA pricing..  We promptly left and received above and beyond service from Subaru of Wichita.  Scott is the man.",1.6
50,"March 14, 2014","Finally, I figured it couldn't hurt to get a quote, so I contacted Eric Jacobson  Right from the start I was impressed with the way that Eric Jacobson  laid out all the numbers for me. As I mentioned, I had already done a lot of research, so I knew that Eric Jacobson  was putting everything on the table in a way that no local dealership had done for me. The deal he offered was excellent, far better than anything I could get locally. Still though, It is saying a lot to say that Eric Jacobson  made me feel comfortable enough to overcome those fears about buying out-of-town  for the first time. Now, with the process over and done with, and a beautiful  NEW 2014 Subaru Brz Limited Automatic sitting in my driveway, I can say that it might not be the fastest way to buy a car, but if you can wait for delivery, then this is absolutely the way to go! Not only was the car-buying process smooth and easy, and the deal unbeatable, but having my car delivered from Houston ,Texas to Silsbee,Texas where I work (M-F 8-5 ) was icing on the cake.He drove 6Hrs+ and 400Miles from Fort,Worth to bring my new car at my job. I will definitely recommend Eric Jacobson to any of my friends or family who are even thinking about buying a Subaru!
I waited almost a year to buy a Subaru BRZ because, 1) the dealerships in my area were not willing to deal on price, (many wanting MSRP+$2000 or more), and, 2) I dreaded the whole car-buying process of dealing with salespeople, sales managers, finance departments, etc. Fortunately, during this time I did a lot of research on the ft86club forums and through these forums learned of Hiley Subaru in Fort Worth, Texas

Fantastic dealership. Eric Jacobson is very straight forward and provides a completely different dealership experience. He gave me a price that was truly unbelievable right off the bat and worked with me every step of the way through the process. He has definitely gone above and beyond what I could have ever expected. This guy even replies to texts in the middle of the night. Detail oriented and checks in to see that everything is going good. If you want a BRZ, Eric Jacobson  is your guy. 

Chris Devero also very friendly and just as helpful as Eric Jacobson . Absolutely no trouble, paperwork was simple. Finally, this dealership does not pressure you at all for extras. They'll inform you about it, but they never push the sale which makes the experience so much more comfortable.

Trey & Eric found the exact Forester to meet our stated needs, even though they had to trade with another dealer. Gary was helpful in appraising our trade so we could make the deal work.
I've purchased Audi's, Corvettes & Infiniti's and I rate this as my most professional buying experience.",5.0

54,"October 02, 2013","I came to Hiely Subaru on 3535 W Loop 820 S
Fort Worth,	TX	76116
to buy a preowned vehicle.
They were super slow and very un-organized services.  Each of their employees gave me different answers for almost every question....
I was told that the car was well inspected with 10000000 point inspection, but the battery died on the way home.  Not only that, the day after, one of the AC fans wasn't working, and it cost $300+ to replace it.  I called the Hiley used car manager and asked him if there was anything he can do to help.  He said ""there is nothing we can do....""
Furthermore, the starter died 1-2 months after.  They seem to sell broken used cars.  I know I was supposed to inspect the car before purchasing, but I didn't because I live 200 miles away from them and they require a nonrefundable deposit before I come over.  Also, I would be more confident with the big dealership like this one, but I was dead wrong.

I definitely stay AWAY from this dealership as much as possible.  I would NOT recommend this dealership to anyone.",2.4
55,"September 29, 2013","This was very nearly the best auto purchase I have ever made, very close. Trey Moss was an excellent sales rep. He worked for my business and I greatly appreciated his efforts. I purchased a 2012 GMC Sierra 1500 that I found via Cars.com. I live almost 200 miles from the dealership and wanted the deal taken care of before I made the drive up to take delivery of the vehicle. Trey answered all of my questions, test drove the truck for me, sent me pictures and worked with me to get my financing in order. Great job! I told Trey we would be traveling with my 2 year old son and didn't want to be sitting at Hiley Subaru for 4 hours with a baby and then have to drive 3 hours home. We got to Fort Worth at about 2 pm saw the vehicle and test drove it. It was exactly as Trey had described it. He then introduced us to Marc in finance, we were in and out of finance in 10 minutes! The truck went back into make ready and we were told we would be on our way home in 15-20 minutes. It is now 2:45 pm, amazing! Well, 2 hours later, still no truck. I was told make ready hadn't even started on it I spoke with the Customer Service manager Mr. Droke, who immediately tried to help. He had the porters stop what they were doing and brought the truck up for us to be on our way, some what clean? As we were leaving Mr. Olson the make ready manager came out to apologize and correct the situation, by now it was almost 6pm and I had a very upset wife and 2 yr old. So close to a perfect car buying experience, could have been in and out in under an hour if not for make ready. This why I rated it ""OK"". Trey was awesome to work with though. Great job Trey!",4.5
56,"August 20, 2013","We were looking to replace 2 vehicles for our business.  We had previously visited other dealerships prior to coming to Hiley Suburu.  At the other dealerships you felt almost accosted before you even got out of the car by the salesman hovering waiting for your vehicle to stop!  At Hiley, we had the opportunity to park, get out and look around a bit before we went inside where we were warmly greeted and welcomed to Hiley.  We felt very comfortable there and had a wonderful buying experience!  We ended up very satisfied with the 2 vehicles we got that day!  Happy salesman, happy customer!",5.0

A very positive experience. I recommend this dealership.",4.8
58,"May 12, 2012","I went in on a saturday to get my oil changed on my subaru outback. Let start by saying I have been going to this dealership to get my car serviced - warrant work and oil changes. I have very happy with the car but Hiley Subaru not so much. Having been to other subaru dealerships in the DFW area I can honestly say that this one cares the least about customers. It may be a customer volume issue. I don't know. Their Service Center office is a cluttered mess and I have never been greeted. This is not what I would expect out of a subaru dealership. So today I go in for an oil change. Once again not greeted. I found the ""service advisor"" tucked away in the back office. It didn't take long for the oil change which was good. I paid and walked to my car. It was parked outside on the ramp to the surface bay entrance. I was told that my keys were in it. OK. I walk up to the car and the window is rolled down. IT WAS RAINING OUTSIDE. They didn't receive the car with the windo rolled down so why did they return it with it rolled down when it was raining outside. Also, my keys were not in the car like they said. Once they found my keys I started it and put the car in Reverse. I heard a loud ""clunk"". This happens when the E-brake is not engaged and the car is parked on incline where there is extra stress on the CVT transmission. I proceded to explain to them what they had done and the tech(David) and Lindi just stand there with blank looks on their face. They proceeded to tell me that they never apply the parking brake because it is an automatic transmission. I asked if they have ever driven the car before and they said yes. The lack of care taken by this service department is appalling. I have very little confidence that the people working there(service AND sales) know anything about subaru vehicles. These are fundamental elements of the car. Electronic park and CVT. I asked to talk to the service manager and he was not working today. In my mind a trained subaru technician should know more about the care that should be taken with the car than I do. I would expect this from a Jiffy Lube but not a subaru service center.",2.0
59,"August 15, 2011",I came in for an annoying airbag light that would turn on & off randomly. The service Dept did a thorough check & could not ID any problems with my vehicle. They were honest about how far they could take the repair to get the light to turn off without guarantee. I opted to let the light do it's own thing and not spend the money chasing something that may not be fixed. I appreciate the fact that they didn't take advantage of me & were honest! They have Renee my respect and will be my dealership/service Dept from now on! Thank you.,5.0

I have had a good experience because Paul has repeatedly taken the time and interest to answer my questions and my concerns.  I'm not sure that my experience would have been so positive had it not been for him.  I recently took my car in for it's first oil change, and never talked to any of the service people-just the cashier.  I'm hoping that, as the dealership progresses, these instances will be less frequent.",4.6
63,"July 07, 2011","In the beginning I explained that my situation was different and a little difficult but I explained to Jeff  exactly how I needed to make a deal.  He was very nice, we spent time driving cars, but ALOT more time sitting and waiting for the finance manager to send us a purchase price.  The finance manager was very rude and unfriendly, he didnt even act like he saw us much less cared about us and a very importatnt decision of purchasing a car.  When an offer finally came across the table I felt very pressured to buy, and Jeff made a statement that he had spent alot of time with us, and he usually did a car deal within 2 hours.  made us feel guilty for spending time looking for the right car. We did not sign at the time but took the vehicle home for the weekend.  After refiguring the deal, we realized there had been $387.00 hidden in the deal in their favor.  I questioned Jeff about it, he said it was charges that all dealerships charged, but never gave a direct answer.   I told him I would like to see if there was another vehicle that would work in my situation.  When we showed up at the dealership, Jeff walked up handed us the keys to our trade in and was not nice at all.  In my opinion, a sales associate should build relationships and plant seeds.  We might not couldve come up with a deal, but I would have definately recommended this dealership and Jeff to other people.  Not now,  I will highly encourage people to go to another dealership to keep from being disrespected and pressured into a sale, along with hidden money that wasnt showing on the purchase agreement. My situation was a difficult deal to make for the dealership, but being treated bad because we didnt want the deal that was offered was not a good way to walk out of Hiley Subaru GMC on 820 in  Fort Worth Texas.

65,"July 05, 2011","Speaking strictly on the sales/dealer experience, ours at Hiley Subaru was one of the better car buying experiences we've had.  We went in for an initial test drive in the 2011 Outback and let our salesman Paul know that we were still in the early stages of the buying process.  Paul didn't try to pressure us into buying anything and gave us enough info to help make our eventual decision.  The dealership had very limited inventory (due to the tsunami in Japan they said), so we test drove one of the few Outbacks they had.  Early the next week, Paul called to let us know a few more Outbacks came in and they had an offer of $500 below invoice.  We decided to go back and test drive one of the new ones.  Again, Paul didn't try to pressure us or try to sell us anything we didn't want.  We liked one of the two new Outbacks they had and we decided to take it.  They worked with us on our trade in and we came to a mutual agreement on the price and we drove away in our new Outback shortly thereafter.  We never felt like our arms were being twisted and both me and my wife felt comfortable the whole time.  I would recommend this dealership (hopefully they can get their inventory levels up soon).",4.7

The dealership is clean and it was obvious that there was a sense of pride in their environment.  Everyone we met was cordial including a brief conversation with Jackson Douglas concerning some used trucks on your lot.  All in all it was a great experience and we will return again for other service and vehicle repair related issues, as well as, used truck shopping when we're ready.

70,"May 27, 2011","I was very pleased with my recent experience w/Hiley Subaru.
My service work (60,000mi) was done on time, the price was what I expected,
and has completely met my expectations for quality. This is my 3rd Subaru ('92,'97,'02), and I'll probably never drive anything else.I consider Subaru
one of the best engineered, highest quality cars on the market today. I expect
the dealership where I have it serviced to be the same caliber quality. Sadly, my last couple of dealership visits before coming to Hiley did not meet these expectations.
I'm VERY glad that we now have a Subaru on the West Side of Fort Worth (it's about time!), who is dedicated to quality customer service, and to caring for our beloved
Subarus with expert service.

I really enjoy driving it. The first week i had it i took it on a 3000 mile road trip,it was great. I really had a great experience at Hiley Dealership. I started the process on the Internet and not once did they try and pressure me . I told them what i wanted ,they gave me a great price on my Truck ,there was no back and forth back and forth. They actually had to find my car(the one with the options that i wanted). I feel i was dealt with Honesty  and no game playing.

He said he'd see what he could do to get my car covered. Less than a week later, I received a call Subaru was expanding the recall to cover all states. The guys were incredibly fast getting me squared away. At the time, I spoke with Rick about some scheduled maintenance that needed to be performed. Fast forward to this week.
