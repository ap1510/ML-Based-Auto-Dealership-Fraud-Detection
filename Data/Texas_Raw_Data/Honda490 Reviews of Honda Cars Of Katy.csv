0,"December 27, 2019","Ordered a part on Fri, they said it would be in on Sat. Scheduled installation for following Fri 8am. Gave them the car at 8am and waited. At 9am they told me the part had not arrived. Waisted an hour. They should have been able to notify before hand, or at least when I dropped off the car, that the part did not arrive. This is the first time I have brought the new car in for service. Needless to say, I'm not impressed. ",1.0

2,"December 18, 2019",I'm a firm believer of service and taking car of your customer with that being said Javier in finance is awesome. Now time for the bad.... my experience from a sales experience and car arrive was horrible. First problem we saw a car listed for certified Honda and as we negotiated a cheaper price they said we had to pay for the certification. First strike... then when asked for the pre owned certification papers they didn't even check the brake pads... they went in the system still couldn't find it. Then since it's pre certified it should come with the two keys that are able to automatically lock your car. They took care of it after calling them out but took two times raising the issue before it was done. Geo the used car manager you have to watch him he will get over you first time then as you catch on he will reset. My recommendation if you buy anything car have it inspected by a mechanic. I don't recommend getting your car service there because even with the oil change they just reset it as checked. They gave me an free oil change on the car but no receipt or documentation it was done. So guess what ? They get a nightmare experience right back and for my clients to bring them business nope.... Not today ?!. ,1.0
3,"November 06, 2019","Purchased a 2012 Mercedes from Honda Cars of Katy and it has been a horrible experience dealing with everyone I have reached out to including Tiffany; Giovanni; Vangie; Travis; Richard Hudson and Malik Otuenhobe. All have been very deceitful; arrogant and rude.  The only person I came in contact with that showed any type of empathy was CJ Walters. All I am asking for is a reimbursement for oil changes that they have failed to do.

I do not recommend this dealership to anyone. Very shady way of doing business.",1.0
4,"October 24, 2019","Fui al dealer por un Honda Civic, ellos pusieron condiciones para la negociación y yo acepte y coloque las mías, posterior a eso me dicen que el credito ya lo corrieron y fue aprobado, me pasan con Malik y todo se complico, dure alrededor de 6 horas o mas en el dealer, al final me dicen que todo esta bien y que me puedo ir ya con mi carro y mi credito aprobado, a la semana me llaman de que vaya al dealer a devolver el carro porque el crédito no fue aprobado por el banco. No entendi, sin embargo fui, me pidieron mas papeles y me dijeron que me volvían a llamar, me llaman de nuevo y dicen que devuelva el carro que el banco no aprobó el credito. Una vez allí me dicen mil excusas de que la culpa fue de Ally Bank , y en Ally Bank dicen que la culpa es del Dealer. Una vez el carro devuelto nadie en el dealer del departamento de finanzas me atiende y se hace cargo de la devolución de downpayment ni de ninguno de las razones por las que tuve que devolver el vehiculo. Esta ha sido la peor experiencia para la compra de un carro, inclusive les comente a los vendedores durante la compra que me sentía incomodo por la forma en como estaban haciendo las cosas. Les hace falta empatía, ganas de hacer las cosas bien, un proceso decente y ser honestos con las personas. El satisfaction journey del proceso de compra es el peor, no le recomendaría a nadie ir para alla.",1.0
5,"September 26, 2019","We went to buy a used 2007 CR-V. Even though it was an as-is car with no warranty, it ran very well and the salesman seemed to know what he was talking about, so after my husband took a look at the inside of the car, we decided to buy it. It took a very long time to get any kind of paperwork done (my husband didn't have a credit score, so that part is understandable), but when we did get the paperwork to purchase, we saw that we were being charged an additional $1000 for 5 years/60K miles worth of oil changes and nitrogen in the tires. We tried to argue with the guy and tell him that we could change our own oil and we didn't need the more expensive tires, but he basically laughed at us and told us that the tires were already on the car. Fine. We lost that battle. We still believed that the car was worth the price, even if it was a little more than we thought. We finally got into the finance office and the finance officer that was working with us told us that even though the car didn't come with a warranty, the bank that the loan was through required a warranty to be on the car, however since we didn't need, want, or ask for a warranty, they were going to absorb that additional cost. We thought that was good because we would not have purchased the car if we were required to purchase our own warranty. We signed the papers and went to get the keys. The team was ""cleaning"" it and we were asked to wait a couple of hours. i had to return to work, so I asked if we could come pick it up later. The salesman, again, laughed at us and said ""it's only a couple of hours."" My husband decided to stay and he waited for almost 3 hours for them to be finished with the car. We finally get the car home and look at the loan documents to setup our account with the bank, and we noticed that we were charged an extra $2300 for a warranty. You know, the warranty that the finance officer told us that the dealership would absorb? We realized that we made the mistake in signing the papers with this added charge, and so we called them to figure out what happened. And called them. And called them. We tried reaching them multiple times, and whenever I FINALLY got someone from the finance office on the phone, he said that he had never heard of the dealership absorbing a warranty cost. When I asked what he thought had happened, because obviously there was either a misunderstanding on our part or a lie on the finance officer's part, he said he really couldn't say and that I would have to speak with the finance officer that was on our account, that he was with a customer and would have to call me back. We never received any kind of communication from them even after we called multiple times. They had both my husband's and my phone numbers, as well as email addresses that were on our applications and multiple documents. We realize that we signed the papers and obviously we will make our payments, but we are not impressed with the disrespect that we have received from this business. We will never buy from them again and we will never recommend that someone else goes to them, unless they want to lied to and taken advantage of. ",1.6
6,"September 18, 2019",Looked at a 2017 Explorer and was offered a drive out price.  I spent 1/2 a day securing financing and ONE HOUR before I was to pick up the vehicle  I was called by the salesman who reneged on the offer.  I called the General Manager (who would not speak to me) however his assistant made no attempt to right the situation or even attempt to counter for wasting my time. Customer's time is apparently not valued at Honda Cars of Katy. Don't waste your time either!,1.0
7,"September 18, 2019","I took my Honda Civic in for oil change.  Got home, oil leaked on my driveway.  It never leaked before.  I took back and they oil pan seal would have to be replaced ($1500).  They replaced it.  Drove it home.  Still leaked.  Took to another dealer and they said the oil filter was not tight.  They tightened it and cleaned it up.  No leak.  Called Katy Honda and they refused to acknowledge that they made a mistake.  The oil pan seal didn’t need to be replaced.",1.8

22,"July 09, 2019","I bought my first Honda Accord in 1989 . It lasted for years with very few mechanical issues. I had 200k miles on the vehicle when I traded it in for a 204 Honda Accord. It will be my last Honda. With just a few thousand miles over the warranty, I started having starter issues. I googled 2014 Honda Accord starter issues and thousands came up. I went to the service department and the service advisor stated it is a KNOWN issue with 2013 and 2014. Honda Accords but no recall has been issued.. he said we are not HONDA,  but independently owned. Last time I checked, they had Honda Cars of Katy on their sign. So he said it’s a known issue but there is nothing the can do but fix it for $1000. I’m going to a local mechanic who will give a lifetime warranty and only charge $450. Needless to say, I will never buy a Honda again! ",1.0

He helped me to schedule another time for the next day to include a loaner car. Later I find out I was charged $7 for the  loaner car when all I did was drive it home. They said it would be $4/gallon. My home is 2-4 miles away. To summarize, good people who want to help, but their system and internal communication is off. ",2.6

30,"July 03, 2019",I have been servicing both cars for a while in this place and I am really pleased with the dynamics of the whole team.  I didn’t pay for the service this time because they found that tire repair was part of the extended warranty. So they can be trusted.

33,"July 03, 2019","I was in to have my oil changed at 258k miles.  The rep tells me I need to have all these other services that are due after 40k miles. I ask him when was the last time the service was performed. He states @ 238k miles. Then, proceeds to say you are at 260k miles it was last done at 230k miles, and it is recommended between 30k - 40k miles. My simple reply: it was done at 238k I am now at 258k that means I am only at 20k miles. These types of tricks to get me to pay more will have me considering doing more business with Cristian Brothers instead of Honda of Katy.  And with 258k miles, I tend to need more work performed.",4.2

Matt, who was the service writer was great in dealing with the issues and reassured me that I did not have to pay a dime. When it came time to pick up my van, he suggested that some maintenance needed attention but WAS NOT pressuring me or made me felt obligated to have it done right then  and there. Told me to come back when I’m ready or free. I respect service writers who are like that. Great place and we’ll definitely come here for our next purchase.

59,"June 25, 2019","I made an appointment for an oil change and tire rotation last week. I also asked the advisor to have my car valued as I have been receiving calls from the sales department that the Katy Honda dealership was in need of used 2017 coupes. I dropped my car off at 8:00am and was asked by the advisor if I wanted to go ahead and have my car washed while it was there - to which I said yes. I returned to pick up my car around 2:30pm. When I arrived, an advisor did not review the notes made on my multipoint inspection paper. In addition, my car had not been washed nor valued by the used cars sales department. After arriving home I noticed one of my headlights wasn’t working which was noted as “OK” on my inspection. Overall, I was not pleased with the service.

80,"May 31, 2019","I went in to get my transmission service done because I was going on a trip to another state. They finish with the transmission service and on my road trip I heard a noise coming from you underneath, I would have gone back to get it checked out but I was a few hours into my road trip, so I stopped to see what it could be. When I look underneath I noticed the cover that covers the transmission pan was hanging , the mechanics couldn’t even bother to do their job correctly, they didn’t put all the bolts on there so it was hanging all the way to my destination. I told one of the employees who had messaged me what had happened and they told me to go anywhere and they would refund me. I ended up getting it fixed but they never bothered to message me back to see how everything was to check up with me. None of the employees bothered to call me or message me, until a few weeks passed and today my mom receives a call saying I had not paid for the work done. They were assuming I didn’t pay when they didn’t do their job correctly , I had to send them a copy of the receipt and bank statement showing I had. What made me really mad is that they could call to say I didn’t pay, but when my car was there messed up because of something they did no one bothered to ask me how it had been handled or fixed.

They (I believe Brittany) called me and ask when I wanted to come in and see it.  As I was talking to her she says they have the car priced wrong.  It is supposed to say ""call for pricing.""  And the reason it should say this, is because this dealership is asking $10,000 over msrp on the car.

145,"October 25, 2018","If you're looking to be taken advantage of, misled and throw money away then Katy Honda is for you. In 2015 I had the displeasure of purchasing a vehicle from Katy Honda. It was my first time buying a car, I had just moved away from my family and was 22 years old. The number they gave me for my trade was 3k less then I had just received from another dealer down the road. When I told them this they quickly backtracked and raised their offer. I should have walked away at this point. The number we verbally negotiated was NOT what was put on the contract (granted I'm at fault for my own naivety and inexperience for not having a closer look), TJ ""helped"" me with the finance side. He quickly whipped through the contract, explaining very little and convinced me he was giving me a great deal on extra protection for the vehicle that would only cost ""dollars a month."" It turns out it was hundreds of dollars and was NOT protection I would have opted for should it have been appropriately explained. Furthermore, I tried to utilize the exterior protection plan for repairs when my vehicle was scratched a month later and was told my claim was submitted repeatedly over a period of weeks and that they were waiting to hear back from the third party company. I finally called the company myself and was told a claim for my vehicle was never submitted from Katy Honda. Meanwhile, the protection plan was continuing to rack up a hefty bill. I cancelled these Extra Protection plans but not after being charged hundreds of dollars and jumping through hoops to complete the cancellation. I also expressed that I would like the tool box from my pickup truck that I traded and was told that an employee already had their eyes on it and so I could not take it. At the time I was overwhelmed enough to not have said anything but I feel this was entirely inappropriate. I also brought the vehicle in for an oil change which resulted in it leaking mass amounts of oil from the filter not being appropriately attached. I then had to pay for ANOTHER oil change a week later and luckily my car wasn't damged. I had considered seeking retribution from Katy Honda but was too upset from these experiences and wanted to put it past me. Clearly it stuck with me though as I now write this review years later. If at least one person can be saved from the horrendous conduct of this car dealer it is worth having written. Oh, I was also sent home without a spare key for the new car and was texted by the salesman a week later saying he forgot and I could come pick it up. ",1.0

Here I go on appointment day, advisor David don't have any idea what I am here for I have to repeat everything again. He told me car will be ready and we will notify you. I go back 5pm and simple response is car is not ready come back next day. I did call 2 time to make sure car will be ready and no call back to update me status. Advisor did not care to call me and notify that do not make a trip. I was pissed off. I told him my time is very important to me, please give me accurate pick up and he could not give me that.

Next day I received a call that car is ready and when I went to pickup I was asked do you want it washed? That was part of repair I requested, I was tired of them so I just simply denied and paid $600+ dollars in repair and left. I will never go back and will never buy car from them.

Worst of all, courtesy check papers said they checked car's tire air pressure and it is 33 in all 4 wheels. I turn on car and noticed air pressure is 37 in all tires.

The salesman literally stood up and left without even looking back. We were left to get up and walk ourselves out. We left there and went to Westside Kia where they were extremely gracious, and she bought a Sportage that night. I will never buy a car from the Katy Honda dealership based on how rude they were to my mother.",1.0

First,  does he realize he is not the president, just a guy receiving my car for service  I was unhappy from the start. Long story short,  two weeks pass, no courtesy calls to tell me what is happening. I made the calls, occasionally out if concern.  I finally called and told them I was coming in to get my car. Nothing accomplished in the two weeks.

The positive is I had a loaner,  which he reminded me, so I should have been satisfied.  The best part was the inside of the windshield was so dirty and driving home into the sun was a joke.  And the outside near as bad,  and no washer fluid!!!

A few days later, when I came back to redo the paper work, the finance manager told me no need to do anything because everything looks OK. But I want to remove some aftermarket add ons which were expensive and useless. The finance manager told me that I already signed the contract and nothing can be removed. Talked to the finance director, same story, told me that the contract has my signature, end of story, better consult a lawyer. The finance manager and the director was disrespectful and deceiving.

The windshield addons, tire protections are expensive and deceiving. I was told those are aftermarket products, and not cancellable. Asked which paperwork shows they are not cancellable, finance director told me there is no where saying they are concellable, so they are not cancellable.

They offer oil change and then added that to the price tag. I'm not there yet but there's people complaining about how they determine when you oil needs to be changed and there are complaints about how long services take. 
The guarantees are worthless and some of them are non cancellable.  Nitrogen for your tires for 2 years for $673?  I bet your tires will worn out anyway.  
$300 for a guarantee that if the car is theft the dealer will get $2k to apply toward your NEXT purchase.  Your will want to finish this transaction before determining if you will get your next car from them. 
A coverage for your windshield for $800 that will cover 3 replacements UP TO $2,000 that's not  worthed.  Paying $800 you are already assuming 40% of the POSSIBLE loss.

173,"November 17, 2016","This was a terrible buying experience (or attempt). We were excited about a car we had just test drove that we thought would meet our needs. However, from the get go, the salesman started playing games. To begin with, he starts with a price significantly above msrp for ""add ons"" that the dealer puts on all cars, but are not necessary and of little value to me. He asks me for a price and acts offended at my figure (old, lame sales tactic). After a half our of back and forth, he comes back saying he can make the price work with a lease. Rather odd considering I didn't give him a monthly payment target. Anyway, he was unwilling to share any actual numbers or print outs, he just kept jotting numbers down on a paper and showing them to me, but not showing the math. The funny thing is the lease payments he was showing me was with more money down and much higher monthly payments compared to what is on Honda's site... when I called him on it, he pulled his manager in. The manager/supervisor gave me other lame excuses until I had just had enough. They were trying to put me in a lease with very high money factor (the equivalent of interest rate) without even running my credit, which is excellent. They are either dishonest, prejudice against some types of people, or, worse, both. I test drove there due to the convenience of their location, but I would NEVER EVER buy from them.

I called Honda USA and they apologized, that they were going to check the problem with the dealership....,again the problem was not resolved. I received a call from the Service manager and he told me that he was going to refund me the amount once the system accepted Honda gift cards...
.it has been a month and not a call from him. Now....about the mechanical problem, they fixed the problem of my ""New"" 800 miles 2015 Odyssey, but guess what..when I received the car..the pilot seat was all full of dirt. As today, the car has 3000 miles and this morning I have another problem, the car is leaking fluid. When I called the dealership they told me they were sorry but they could not take my car until later next week....It is very clear that this dealership does not have quality controls to verify that the car does not have any defect before they sell them, also a lack of control to keep the cars clean when they are working with them and it is also clear the lack of common sense from the sales manager. The only nice person who tries to help is the service manager.I am giving you my experience with this dealership to avoid you very frustrating situations if you are going to buy a new car.",1.2

Always have a plan, be direct and polite, confident not arrogant and if you sense the sales person is not for you (decide this in 15 minutes) then walk.

This is the worst dealership around Houston area. I met a sale person name Holly Le. She was nice at first when I asked her to test drive a new Honda Accord LX. I gave it a test drive and didn't really like that car, so I came back and asked if I could test drive another car. Her facial expression completely changed to angry. She asked me ""WHY? WHY NOT BUYING THIS CAR?"". As a buyer, I had the right to test drive many cars as I wanted before making my decision. Eventually she gave me a second car to test drive. I came back and worked on a deal and she wanted $27,000 for a Honda Accord LX. What a joke! I walked out the door and will never come back to this dealership.

They could not continue with the state inspection because the tires would not pass.  In fact, she pointed out, they were so worn that the steel belts were showing through.  She was so concerned for my personal well being that she told me not to do my usual search for the best tire prices in the area, but rather, that I should go immediately and have my tires changed because I and my wife were at a terrible risk driving on those tires.

I went to my usual tire dealer, purchased replacement tires and returned to Katy Honda for the remainder of my service needs.

That's $50 a tire! There's places around that use 92% nitrogen and charge less than $5 a tire or I can fill it up free at my job. So for him to tell me that was his cost was a flat out lie.

So after a few months of practice driving I wanted to give a full review of my experience here. I have visited this dealership several times in the past 8 months and can say overall I've had a good experience each time. My first interaction with my salesman, Simon, was great! He was very professional and completely knowledgable about the car I wanted. This is my first ""new"" car and I was very wary about talking to a salesman but he eased my anxiety. I can't really say the same about the financing department, I felt that T.J. was not very helpful in explaining everything I was signing. I felt I paid a lot more than what I had originally agreed to. I think I had stars in my eyes and didn't realize it until it was too late. However, I have been into the repair department for some recalls and repairs and have had nothing but great praise for everyone there. This praise also includes the guys on the tire side who had to replace two tires thanks to the horrible potholes here in town! I also, just recently returned to get help with my new Navigator App and Simon, who had not seen me in 8 months, remembered me. I was impressed. He helped walk me through everything just as he had promised he would do many months ago. I am a huge fan of Honda. My son is still driving my 1991 Honda Accord and it's still running strong. I love my new Honda Fit. I am so grateful for all of the hard work and commitment that Simon and the repair department have given me each time I've come in. ",4.4

My husband told them from the beginning we were not financing through Honda because I had been pre-approved by my credit union to pay for the car.  
We needed a purchase contract to give to the credit union so they could create the payoff check.    Initially they asked for a copy of my driver’s license because the car we traded in was just under my name and the financing through the credit union was just under my name.  The car was purchased on Friday, Nov. 7th, the first contract they filled out only had my husband’s name, the second contract they filled out, my last name was wrong and finally the third contract was correct.  As soon as I received the corrected contract on Wednesday, Nov. 12, 2014 I immediately faxed the contract to my credit union.  That day the credit union overnight federal expressed the check to the dealership.     
T.J., Honda of Katy’s finance person, called my husband today, November 28, 2014, 15 days after they received the check from the credit union and said he had financed the car through Honda Finance because they had not received my credit union’s check in time.  I told him it had been overnight Federal Expressed to them on November 12. (the credit union has the Fed Ex delivery acknowledgement). Then, he said they had not cashed the check because the check was just under my name and not my husband’s.  Why is that our fault and why didn’t he call us when he received the check?  
I told him, the car we traded in was only under my name and I had filled out paperwork to get the car transferred to the dealership, they didn’t have a problem processing that paperwork with that being only under my name.  I told him he had been given a copy of my driver’s license the first day we decided to buy the car and it showed only my name.  How come they waited 15 days to tell us they were not cashing the credit union’s check because it was only under my name?    I told T.J. it was not our fault and I was returning the car because we had 30 days to change our mind and he said we couldn’t return the car, it was too late.  These people are a bunch of crooks.

Sales guy Tomas is great. Negotiated my Honda Accord LX including all for $ 22,000/- and finance guy Mr. T. J. Ashraf made the deal horrible taking the cost to $28,903/-. Mr. T. J. added all sort of coverages with multiple insurances that he could to make his commission without asking the customer. Dragged the conversion for about 4 hours without explaining or even showing the details of total cost amount. Very cleverly he know how to take customer signature without making him know/read the details and in future too he would never show the documents before the car delivery, SO BE CAREFULL, IF DEALING WITH Mr. T.J. He even not handover the documents in person even if you ask, instead he send by mail which takes about 2-3 days after your car delivery. After reviewing the documents almost after a week of finalizing the deal I got shocked seeing the total amount. Run back to meet Mr T. J. and he started showing his real color this time. Asked to wait in the lobby for 2 hours and did not listen or admitting that he made any mistake. He showed telling you signed and you must read before sign. No option left for me to talk to the new car Director, somehow able to convince the problem but Mr Director too did not help much. I asked to pull my sales to finance transition document and he never handed over me a copy since all truth is agreed on that paper. Repeatedly continued visiting the showroom and discussing with every possible persons finally did some math and another Director returned me only $500/- saying they incorrectly added additional $500/- to the deal. 

I would suggest take the finance document to your home read that thoroughly before signing and giving back to Mr. Finance in Honda Cars of Katy. Never forget these details by blindly trusting these guys on the excitement of buying a new car. Few of my receipts are not even handed over to me for which Mr T.J. added the amount in my total cost in the name of various coverages. Even though I asked and waited for him to hand over the receipts 2 hours a day for three days he did not give instead given me a different copy and the way he handed over the copy was not forgettable. He came to my chair given on my hand saying ""Thank you very much"". Till I see if I received the correct copy, he was about 20 feet away, I run back to him and when I asked for the correct copy, he told ""I do not have anything, Thank you very MUCH."" I finally given up not to waste my time dealing with such cheap people. People having such attitude towards customer should be fired if Honda Cars of Katy really cares about its customers.

It was late, so Mr. Naylor told me to bring the car in the next morning, and he would research this matter more the following day, and he would call me.  To my amazement Mr. Naylor called me the next day, and the first words out his mouth were:  Mr. Washington I apologize, the car does have a bad transmission.  He told me that he spoke with Mr. Henry Reece, and that I had some options...  I was told that I could find another car the same price, or use the money as a payment on another, or just get a refund back.  Hearing these words come out of Mr. Naylors mouth almost brought me to tears.  Buying a car *as is* with no warranty, I knew that the dealership did not have to do anything.  So now I am a loyal customer, and I am honored to know that such dealerships are here in the city of Katy that I live in.  Thanks to Mr. Andrew Naylor, Mr. Henry Reece, and Mr. Alex Young for being true honest professionals. ",5.0
267,"October 06, 2014","I was  disappointed in the way they handled my case and forced me to take a car that  has a factory fault. I am a single mother , struggling, My coming in to the dealership to trade in my old Honda accord was because I wanted peace of mind, and not have to take my car to the dealership for repair back and forth, but to my dismay I now have to deal with a new car with factory fault. I don't think I was treated right simply because I already signed the deal which leaves me at their mercy. Mr   Dwain actually told me that I either  have the car fixed and go home with a patched up new car, or drive it around like that with the fault. he also said no one is perfect but God.  well that part is right I have not had a good experience with Honda , which makes me wonder why I went back to Honda again.
 No matter how well they think they car fixed the car the fact still remains that they sold  to me a car with factory fault.
That car should not be sold at  the same value of a brand new  with no fault, the fact that it has a factory fault should accord an adjustment in the price. It was not fair at all. But unfortunately I am just a lady and the deal has been done and I am at the mercy of Honda cars of katy. I will take the car but if anything happens to me and my children while driving that car then I will  take a legal action. God spare my life. If a car comes with a factory fault it should be taken back to the factory and have it  fixed  and sold at a reduced price not patched it up and sell it to a poor struggling lady.",1.2

270,"August 20, 2014","Recently bought a Honda CRV EX-L from Honda Cars of Katy on 08/16/2014. The price agree with the Sales Person with my signature was $18,400 including everything within that vehicle, tax, etc, out of the door. That meant if I would have paid cash, I would have walked out from there in $18,400. I traded my previous Honda CRV at $11,000. 
The Finance Department cheated me and they added many extra charges on top of $18,400.00. I tried contacting 'T.J.Ashraf' the guy who financed, but he gave a cold face on us and will not give me even the details of my sales committment paper because he knows that he is cheating. The sales person Justin still agrees, even in front of 'T.J.Ashraf' that I $18,400 was the sales price including everything. I called Honda Director but no one is answering me and no one is ready to talk to me.
What kind of review and feedback do you expect from me.
Why can't you guys speak the truth and provide me all the papers which I signed initially ($18,400)
I just want that be fair with me and refund the various extra charges levied on me. If you want, I'm ready to pay in cash as well. I have already put this option in front of 'T.J.Ashraf' but he told me that - 'You do whatever you want to do!!!!!!!!!!!'",1.0

Blind spot lights were not working and light was on dash.  Also had GPS  and bluetoooth questions.  As it turns out we had accidentally pushed button and turned off the blind spot light. So they asked Serive  Rep Leah to help answer our questions.  She came out to our car and took the time to explain how GPS and phone worked.  You hear a lot of this when you buy vehicle, but you can't remember it.
 I was so frustrated with the GPS that I had just quit using it. Seems I could never give it enough info to work for me.  It was not user friendly.  Leah explained  how to use GPS more easily and why phone conversation was switching intermittenly between phone and speaker in vehicle.    

Leah took the time to answer our questions. She was very knowledgeable, kind, and patient.

After visiting four different Honda dealers in the Houston area, I found the preowned minivan I was looking for in Honda Cars of Katy. Ben was very courteous, professiona,  and prompt in his communications during the transaction. When I received the car, I noticed that there were a few stains in different places inside, the pocket on the back of the front passenger seat was detached, and I had failed to check that the 8th passenger extra seat listed as part of the equipment on the car's web listing, was present. It was not. After addressing these issues with Ben and manager Tiffany, they were kind enough to send the minivan back for further detailing, had the pocked repositioned and offered to be on the lookout for an extra seat that would match my minivan's interior. A few months later, Ben called to let me know they had a seat for me to pick up. It has been four months since I got the minivan and I am VERY satified with my purchase. It runs great and had not had any problems. My purchase price included a free -oil -changes- for- life card, and I have already been back to have it done. Leah at their service department provided me with impeccable attention, she provided me with a very comprehensive report of points they checked stating that everything is in good shape, and even took care of a recent recall which I was not even aware off. Their waiting area is super comfortable and the car was ready in less time from which I was told upon my arrival. Even though I was concerned in the beginning, Tiffany and Ben have made sure this has been an overall pleasant experience. I look forward to buying from Honda Cars of Katy in the future. Thank you!

We had a very unusual situation where a mechanic from another auto shop may have ruined our engine and we took the car to Honda Cars of Katy for an assessment and to get the engine rebuilt. During the two month process in dealing with the insurance companies etc, Leah was top-notch.  Any time that she had additional information on the situation, she provided us with an immediate update (which was better than even our insurance company did!) and she was a wonderful source of knowledge in general about cars.  Leah can explain the different aspects of car repair to a non-mechanic (like me), in a way that I always understood exactly what she was saying.  Working with Leah (and Honda Cars of Katy) made a pretty horrible situation a little bit better.  Also, after this situation, I will never service my vehicles anywhere but a dealership (even for a state inspection and oil change).

My sales rep, Derek, had incredible patience with me as I switched from car to car deciding which would fit my budget and which I could buy and keep for the next ten years. He was there to help me and not to just make a sale and earn a commission for himself. Derek worked diligently with Dwain in securing me financing as that became an issue due to some unforeseen challenges I encountered over the past few years. Dwain worked to get me a 2.99% finance rate and never once acted unprofessional or rude. I read in one of the reviews posted here where someone asserted Dwain offended an individual. Many people don't realize that purchasing a large ticket item is a win-win game. If you are nice to people and treat them with dignity and respect, you will get that back in return. They will help you when you help them. Thank you Derek for your professionalism and never-give-up attitude in helping me.

304,"February 12, 2014","We brought a Honda Civic 2010 last Feb 2011 at this dealership. Everything was a breeze. Our sales person was very friendly and all the staff too. Price is a little bit high but since we live in Katy, we wanted a dealership near our place.
Moving forward to 2013, I went there last October for a routine check-up at the quick service center and the mechanic said that I needed new battery and my car has a small chip and it will not cost me anything because it is still under warranty as as for the crack, my insurance will cover  it. After everything was done, they billed me for the new battery since they found out that even though we bought it on Feb 2011, the car was purchased by the dealership on Sept 2010 so my 3 years warranty expired for a month. The manager was condescending with her tones and manners. I wrote a letter to the manager and after a week, I received a nasty voicemail from their office that it was my fault that apparently it was my request to change the battery. Beware of these people, it is a common fact that when you go to a service center, they will try find something wrong with the car so they can sell something.
Unluckly, that car was in an accident the following month. I went to the dealership last January, 2014 to file for the GAP insurance per advice of the Honda financial services. I called on Feb 11, to follow-up the status of the claim and he said they are not responsible to this claim and call Honda Financial services. I called HFS and said HCK should file the complete the claim first and they will forward it to the financial services. I went back to the dealership and talked to TJ, from the financial service. I introduced my self and told him that I talked to him over the phone this morning. I explained to him the purpose of this meeting and he said it was maybe cancelled. When he came back he said he did not see my file there and the person in charge is not present. I was still trying to asked him about what he said earlier that my claim might have been cancelled and he rudely brushed me off. The total time spend for the 2 encounters was less than 3 minutes. After he said what he wanted, he turned his back and left. This dealership is only good if you are buying a car but customer service is nil. I bought another Honda at another dealership.

Too bad for him and the sales department because of this I opted to buy my wife a 2013 Kia Optima and my daughter a 2013 VW Jetta.  The salesman at the VW lot was great also, his name is Andy. My son in law's brother just bought a Pilot and a Honda Mini van.  Guess what they did not go here. You will regret buying at this dealership.  Chris R.",1.8
313,"October 09, 2013","today is 10/9/13. I went to Honda cars of katy with my wife to buy a Honda civic. Instead we found a 2012 Honda accord with 11thousand mile on a clearance sale. we liked  the car and offered drive out price of 15 thousand dollars. I also offered to throw my 2002 Toyota corolla to sweeten the deal. mr. faheem afridi told to us to wait and came back few minutes later with Ms. Tiffany who introduced her self as the sales manager. she said she was happy with the choice we made and said we had a deal. the time was close to 3 pm and we had to pick our kids from school. we agreed that we were going to come back and seal the deal after we picked the kids and delivered my 2002 Toyota corolla. an hour or so later, we received a call from mr. afridi who wanted to know if we were on our way. I told him we were and arrived at the dealership few minutes later. we handed the key to my vehicle to mr. Apollo( another sales person)  who came back with mrs. tiffany shortly. she went straight to my car and drove it away. mr. Apollo approached us and offered to show us other vehicles as the one we had a deal on has been sold to some body else.  we went inside to demand explanation and found mr. afridi making a deal to sell the Honda accord we agreed to buy to somebody else. Ms. tiffany(the sales manager)also came back with my car and insisted that my vehicle was not in a condition  she expected it. I began my conversation by asking her why she sold the vehicle knowing full well we had a deal on it and knowing we were heading to her dealership to conclude the purchase. she said as long as we did not put our deal on a paper, she can sell the car any time. and she said this is a'' the American way of doing business."" I do not understand why she had to emphasize on the so called "" the American way"". I am a proud American who lived in the united states to know how business is conducted in the country. if her comment has any thing to do with mine or my wife's accent, I will leave it to her. in the mean time , mr. afridi who was eager to sell us that car approached us and exhibited three 20 dollar bills as a deposit made on the car by the new buyer. first of all, I could have put a deposit on the car if this was offered to me. secondly, instead of leading us on a deal that was not going to materialize, a simple phone call could have been made to tell us the truth and let us make a decision to travel 20 to 30 mile to look at any other vehicles .Instead  the sales manager and her associate made a ploy to drag us back to the dealership to sell us another vehicle. I believe whether  it is the ""American way"" or any other  way, courtesy and better customer relation are part and parcel of a good business practice. Ms. tiffany wanted to make a big deal about the condition of my corolla and felt the need to insist  that it was not in a condition she expected. I asked her out of curiosity why she felt the need to test drive my corolla knowing full well that she had already sold the accord that we were interested in and had a deal on. she said she had other accords similar to the one I missed on that are on shipment . what a ridiculous excuse. I feel betrayed. I understand sale is made to the higher bidder. but I should have been given a chance to bid on it too. it is not fair to drag me from my home to drive 20 to 30 miles with a false promise that I had a deal and then say by the way we do not have the car you made a deal on but we will sell you the ones we want to sell you, not the one you want to buy. I hope this is not a business model other Honda dealerships follow.  I have heard of sleazy car sales person. I thought it was just in comedies!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1.0
314,"September 16, 2013","It all started when I bought the vehicle. I worked with a sales person to try and find a vehicle. I mostly wanted a 2012 Honda Civic. The woman showed me a car and when told about the lifetime oil change package, I asked if it would work at any dealership. Her response was that it would work at any Honda Certified Dealership. When we ended up going through with the deal, I had a trade in that was going to work with it. They took my plates off and shredded them before their finance department even approved me. Because most people don't get approved through them, they gave the car to me as a loaner and told me to shop around at banks and try and get approved. For the next couple of days I worked super hard to find a place but since it was right before thanksgiving, it was a tad hard to do. The sales woman called me up and said since your taking too long, we can't make a deal with you. Bring it back to the dealership in 30 minutes before we close. I was shocked by this reaction and told her that wasn't possible as I was an hour away. I got the manager on the phone and he told me not to worry and actually keep it until after the holidays. We would work it out on Monday. We eventually got it all worked out and the sales manager was great! Now a couple of weeks later, I got a phone call with a survey about my experience. I honestly told me what happened and that was the end of it. Fast forward until September of 2013. I called my local honda dealership and mentioned the lifetime card, they told me it didn't work. Because I was confused, I called the sales dept at Honda Cars of Katy. I spoke with an internet manager who was great. He said that he wasn't sure why the sales person said that but he would look into it. I never received a call back. Today, I made a follow up and talked with Tiffany. She said that because I gave them a bad survey, they wouldn't help me! I'm absolutely shocked and when I said, ""So you won't help me because you don't like my response"" She said you can interpret however I want.",2.4
315,"September 01, 2013","We needed a new car and we weren't quite sure what we wanted yet, so Justin showed me every type of car on the lot. He was very knowledgeable about the products and very straightforward with the negotiations. He took the time to explain all of the questions I had and was very patient with us. If he didn't know the answer he went and found out. He made sure that our kids were well entertained and cared for as we got down to business. When our brand new car was presented to us he took it upon himself to have the interior spot cleaned in three or four places that we didn't even notice before. Then he explained every detail of the new technology that we had never really worked with before. 

We shopped at several other Honda dealerships in Houston and nobody treated us with as much respect and genuine empathy than Justin and his managers at Katy Honda. This is the only reason we decided to buy there, especially since their prices were a little bit higher than some of the competitors. What we got in terms of customer service more than made up for the few hundred dollars we would have saved haggling like beggars down the road. 

For those of us who still appreciate the value of customer care and honest dealing, call Justin over there at Katy Honda. It will take you back to the old days when businesses actually appreciated their customers. I will make sure to stop in and greet my new friends every time I come in for my free oil change!

317,"June 29, 2013","Words cannot even begin to describe how terrible this dealership is. The salesman that I dealt with was not only unprofessional, but extremely rude. His manager, Musa, was even worse as he flat out lied to me to get me into his dealership to perform the old 'bait-and-switch.' 

I called before I went into the dealership to get the VIN number of the car he was interested in selling me, but that obviously was too much to ask for because he stalled and never called back. In any case, I went out of my way to make it to his dealership after he decided to agree with on a negotiated price for a Honda Accord after some back and forth. After arriving at the dealership, with the required documents, paperwork, and money he started playing games. At first he didn't have the car in stock (it was arriving next week? yeah right.) and then that quickly changed when I started to walk. He said he had ANOTHER car just like the one I was interested in, in stock (how convenient right?). The only 'problem' was that this 'other' car was loaded up with options and add-ons that I told him AHEAD of time that I wasn't interested in paying for. He baited me in with a verbal offer that he wasn't willing to honor, then made a disrespectful second offer that was over $1000 higher hoping that I would be exasperated and just take whatever he was willing to give me. 

NO THANK YOU BUDDY.

I walked out and I pray I never get a call back from these scammers ever again. Never will they catch me stepping foot on their lot again.

They added on $2000 worth of extra features without telling me they were optional...luckily I noticed before it was too late. When I called multiple times a few days later to ask for the VIN, the salesperson didn't return a single one of my calls so I went there in person and saw her sitting out front drinking a soda and chatting it up with her colleagues.

I was also told that someone would contact me when my license plates arrived; of course no one did.

I bought the ""free oil changes for life"" option and have put in multiple requests for service but no one responded, presumably because they're not going to make anymore money off of changing my oil. The only response I got was when someone called asking if I'm ""still interested in buying a Honda Fit"". I patiently explained that I've already bought a Honda Fit from them and was trying to get it serviced, and asked her to get the service department to call me. Of course I never heard anything back.

But wait... It gets worst with Alex the finance guy...

When we finally come to an agreement on the car price, the finance guy Alex is a complete liar, says one thing and the very next day denies everything. He was nice while he made the sale, but then a complete jerk & very rude. When i asked for his business card, he just threw it on the desk for me to get. He lied on the Honda warranty, did not go over all the options, will not answer your questions directly, gives you the run around on almost everything. He said he was going to try to help us and have us talk to the owner to get help, and all he did was bring his coworker acting as a manager. He had promised us a meeting with the owner, we set a time to meet, we get off from work, and when we get there, nobody even knows about our case and we never got to meet with him. Alex made it very clear that he does not care about customer service or experience, as long as he makes a sale out of false advertisement. He went back and edited the documents she had signed. He talked about reviewing a video, but after he reviewed it, he changed his mind about going over it with his manager and us. Complete scam!!! Do not let him talk you into the extended warranty, he will say anything to get the sale. Doesn't even acknowledge or shake your hand once there is an issue to be addressed.

I had also written and told him that I will have to drive to Katy with my wife and 2 children, a 6month old &amp; a 2yr old, hence I wanted it reconfirmed. He emailed back 1/19/2012 - &quot;Yes the price sounds right, see you here on Monday&quot;.

the the car. His manner was rude and condescending. Next, D Rogers came to speak to me and insisted he was the GM. Neither of these men could explain why the additional charges were not mentioned in any of the phone calls/e mail for the FINAL price. I was not allowed to meet the GM despite several requests.

On returning to dealership, he was painstakingly inquisitive about my knowing my price points, even without offering me any quotes. I guess he thought I was just some kid off the streets who wanted to 'test drive' a nice ride, without actually having any intentions of buying. But I'm no fool. I had done my research and was in talks with countless dealers in the Houston area - it was just a matter of seeing who budged earliest. I finally gave in and quoted him a price (a bit on KBB's FPP lower side, but that's how any buyer would start). He seemed shocked (as If I were robbing him at gunpoint). He quickly called his manager, and the brusquely arrogant prick quoted me an extremely exorbitant price (atleast 30% over KBB's FPP). It was clear to me - they wanted me out.

Then, went into Justins office, qualified for the 1.9% ext. Great.  Then Justin says, hey, why not lease.  It is so much better.  Talked my husband into it. BUT, did not say the lease costs $3000 more!! When we signed, my husband noticed the higher amount and asked Justin why it said $37,800.  Justin looked my husband in the eye and said don't worry, that is just a number the computer throws out, we have the car as negotiated for $34,900.  well, a few days later our first statement arrives in the mail....$37,800.  He blatantly lied to us. My husband has just left the dealership trying to sort it out and was lied to again.  They now claim we never negotiated a price of $34,900, and that they cannot change the deal to what we origionally went in for, which was the $34,900 and the 1.9% interest rate.  We phoned honda finance, and they said yes we can change it, they just need the dealership to do the paperwork  So Justin lied AGAIN saying cannot be done. They care nothing for customer service, they will lie to you and steal your money.  As this is what they have essentially done.  They have stolen $3000 from us.  We will now be going to the BBB, and going to higher powers at Honda to let them know that Honda of Katy are a bunch of lying thieves.  NO integrity. No Morals.  Do not go here.  They will act nice, and turn on you like wolves.  They could easily have remedied this situation that they deliberately caused, but are unscrupulous.  


**UPDATE!!!**  Well, after many a sleepless night, there is finally a silver lining.  I contacted Rob Whootten, who kindly canceled the lease and did a new contract, no add ons, no tricks.  It was done quickly and he was very nice about it.  EVERYTHING was corrected and I am now enjoying my Honda Pilot.",1.0
350,"July 29, 2012","Very dishonest dealership, after I agreed on the price of the vehicle they added over a thousand dollars back to the price of the car during financing for ""add ons"" that were not disclosed or agreed on. I told the salesman upfront that I would not pay for any add ons the dealership chose to put on their cars (they put these on ALL their cars) and if he couldn't negotiate a price without them I would buy elsewhere. I was reassured that I wouldn't be charged for the ""extras"" and we agreed a price from there. Stupidly I didn't check my paperwork before I signed the contract so the got me. When I checked my paperwork when I got home I realized that $1250 had been added back to the price I agreed on for 3 bogus items that I didn't want or need. Shame on me for not checking the contract before I signed but shame on them for being dishonest and underhanded. On top of that when I tried to get an explanation for the extra $1250 that was added without my knowledge I never got an answer from the finance manager, salesman, or sales manager. They tried to act like I didn't know what I was talking about even though the sales manager told me he could see on my contract the additional $1250 I was talking about. He pointed the finger at the finance manager. Numerous emails to the finance manager for an explanation went unanswered apart from him telling me to come in so he could show me I was wrong. They want you to come into the dealership so they can talk in circles until you start believing they are right and you are wrong. Thats what they tried to do over the phone as well. Well I had more than one knowledgeable person look at my contract and agree that $1250 was added back to the price I agreed for 3 crappy add ons. I even talked to the consumer relations manager about my concerns and was assured he would address them and call me back on after the weekend. Well after a week and no call (from anyone) I called him back and he didn't even remember me, had to look it up to jog his memory. He then told me sorry, nothing he can do, I am stuck with the $1250 and I should be happy about the great deal they gave me. Tried to confuse me by spinning off a bunch a numbers and how I actually got all the add ons for free and that I'm confused. All I can say is stay away from this place or be sure to check your contract and everything else before you sign. I know it was my mistake that I didn't but I'm a trusting person and I got burned for that. Dealerships like this is what gives car sales a bad name. I hope they are happy with their additional $1250 and they feel good about how easily they got one over on me. ",1.5

I wanted to take the time to thank your service department for their excellent customer interface and honesty. Before I visited your dealership I had a well-known auto repair shop look at my wife’s vehicle. They advised me that her car had a faulty “throw out bearing” and would cost us over $1000 to fix it. We felt the price was too expensive and sought a second opinion from your staff. The representatives informed us that what we were advised from the other shop was incorrect and only a simple adjustment would remedy the problem. As a result, we had the dealership conduct the brake repairs that we would have otherwise done elsewhere and expect that we will continue to bring our repair business to you.  I thank you as a customer and as a soldier for your honesty and professionalism. 

Sincerely,

Mr. and Mrs. Gutierrez

He actually made what can be the most painful part of the process … fun. Though it was late by the time we left that night, not only was most of the staff still there, but they were upbeat and busy. On each of our three visits, we felt welcome and comfortable and were not pressured in any way. It’s easy to see why the dealership has a lot of activity. Purchasing from Honda Cars of Katy has a lot of service perks specific to this dealership, as well, and will actually decrease the amount spent on routine service. In addition to the budget savings, there, I get over 39 mpg … no kidding! I am hap- hap- happy to have my 2012 Civic save me so much money on service requirements and gas and look so beautiful … even if it’s just parked in the driveway!",4.8
386,"July 12, 2011","I walked into Honda cars of Katy Monday, July 11 to check out some used cars. I had a good idea of what I wanted but my specificity worked against me in terms of used vehicles. The new CRZ, however, caught my eye though it was way out of my intended price range. After talking with Javier and my grandmother whose opinion was dear to me as she was my co-signer, we decided it was the way to go. Javier was so helpful in the decision making process. During test driving he was knowledgeable and really down to earth, making the experience an awesome one. We even jammed some tunes, testing out the system of course. When the hard part came, convincing my grandmother to help me get this car instead of a used one we had originally came in for, he was again very amicable and down to earth with her, eventually convincing her to get on board with us, which is quite a feat. When the paper work was all done with and it was time to hop into my new car, he took the time to familiarize me with the bluetooth and nav systems, which I would have never gotten done on my own. So all in all, having to spend all day at a car dealership was a great experience thanks to Javier and all the others that helped me and my grandmother out that day. Also a huge thank you to Tiffany and Tarik.",5.0

So after explaining to him the short story, he offerred to help put me in a brand new Honda Pilot at around the same price I was paying for the used one. Javier went above and beyond the call of duty and was patient and very real with me about everything and ultimatly in the end made my experience at the dealership a stress-free one. ",4.0

I have never been fond of pushy car salesmen and I have walked away from many dealerships when salesmen pushed my buttons!  I actually went with my daughter to help her find a used car and walked away with not only a car for her but one for myself also!  My daughter still can't believe I bought a new car when my intention was to wait till October.

The one negative i had was when our Salesman went to introduce us to his manager, he never even stood up or extended his hand to meet me.  I thought this was strange since I was purchasing a car from him.  I would have liked for him to at least extend a handshake instead of sitting there and saying hi.

They demanded $1,000 above the price advertised online, stating that they would not make any profit at the advertised price.  The sales agent told us that the hybrid batteries were not known to fail.  Our hybrid battery lasted one week, prompting an automotive technician to tell us that it had been ""fixed"" for the sale.  The Finance department head managed to add on all sorts of charges, including a $500 fee for ""Lifetime Free Oil Changes."" (My fault for missing that one on the contract, but he did his best to confuse us.)  The Finance Department Head also sold us a 3 year complete warranty, then printed out a lesser warranty to give to us.  (We discovered this and challenged him and he said he used the wrong form.  They were two distinctly different colors.)  Only after extensive work on my part, reporting them to the Better Business Bureau, and starting a case action suit with Honda America did they agree to replace the Hybrid battery at their expense.

413,"March 13, 2011","I was looking for a good pre-owned/used small SUV in good shape with as little mileage as possible and for a price I could afford.  After looking at several dealerships on a Saturday, I stopped at Honda Cars of Katy to see what they had.  After being greated by a very friendly salesperson outside (all the sales people were very friendly) and escorted inside and giving him (can't remember his name) all the information about what I was interested in and what car I now owned, he called Tiffany Lively (used car specialist) over to talk to me.  She asked if I'd ever heard of AirCheck of Texas.  No, I had not.  She explained that it is a government program to get cars that are 10+ years old off the streets and help car buyers with as much as $3,000 to get a newer vehicle.  My car was 11 years old. She gave me the paperwork to complete and bring back to her.  None of the other dealerships had even mentioned this program to me.  I completed the paperwork and took it and the required documents to her on Monday evening.  She looked it over, ran copies of what she said was needed, and said she would fax it to the proper place and follow up with them and let me know if and when I was approved.  One week later (remember -- this is dealing with a government agency!), she notified me that she had received a response that I was approved and that I would be receiving a voucher for $3,000 within 5 business days.  She said that since I was approved, that I could come in and see what all they had.  I went back on Saturday morning, and she got Salesman Tony Dubon to help us.  He was great!  Tiffany told us what cars were in my price range; Tony brought each one around, and we test-drove them.  He was very knowledgeable, friendly, and helpful.  We finally decided on a great 2008 Honda CRV that had been a lease vehicle and that had just been turned in the day before.  We finalized the deal; the CRV was washed, serviced, and ready.  I took it home that very evening.  I have really enjoyed driving it.  Tiffany and Tony were great.  They both have followed up and contacted me and thanked me for my business and welcome me back for anything other assistance I may need.  Plus, I was given a card to take to their quick service center and use for oil changes for life at no cost to me; just have to pay the couple of dollars for tax charged.

414,"March 05, 2011","My husband went to look at a Civic Si there, ready to purchase with a trade in... WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. I'll try to condense his experience... they took 3 days to get him a REAL quote (not ""Oh yeah... should be no problem to get it at $price""). In the meantime, they never called him back, even when they told him a specific time to expect the call back. William was his salesman, and while he was very nice and easy going, obviously communication is not his (or anyone else's) strong point. The only time my husband spoke to them was when he called them himself. Before they even got him the actual monthly payment amount they let him take the car for a couple days (he works at a shop and wanted to check it out there). He came in to bring it back and talk numbers (as they'd been planning for 3 days), and they made him wait for about an hour before someone came to speak with him. They quoted him a 20% interest rate when BMW had quoted him an 8% interest rate. The monthly payment was $200+ higher than the rate they said they could get him. They obviously got him in the car thinking he would fall in love and impulsively buy it without caring about the actual monthly payment... WRONG. My husband had to DEMAND his keys back. It was a waste of 3 full days time, and not only did the staff not care about the customer, they didn't even call him back... isn't that considered something like an auto sales crime... seems like all other dealerships won't STOP calling you! This is by far our WORST EVER dealership sales experience-- Unless you have time  and money that you're looking to waste, do not visit this dealership. This is the first online complaint I have ever had to write.

UPDATE 2 DAYS AFTER ORIGINAL POST: My husband received a phone call from Tiffany, a manager at Honda of Katy. She is was quite upset at the negative review we posted (naturally). She demanded that my husband pull down the review, and when he declined, she insisted that she would reply to our review by posting his credit information on the website. My husband frankly told her that she could not legally do that as it could considering defamation of character. Aside from the legal aspects of it, we found it incredibly rude that she had to audacity to threaten to put up a customer's personal and private information online. She even went on further to explain how important this issue was to her by promising on her children that she would reply to our review in a negative manner towards us. I guess this is what it takes to get a call back from their employees.",2.3

We bought a used Honda Odyssey on a late rainy Saturday evening.  We entered the dealership with our kids after an evening get together.  I had seen the van online and wanted to see it in person.  We had planned to debate over it on Sunday and buy Monday.  Dio met us at the door and was very friendly.  He pulled the van around to the covered and lit area for us to look it over.  We liked it except we wanted our mechanic to inspect it on Monday.  He asked us what it would take to get us in the car that night, and I told him my price, interest rate, and the need for our independent inspection.  I did not expect him to be able to meet any of those, but was pleasantly surprised when he came back with approval.  While we signed the paperwork, Dio helped entertain the kids with balloons and goodies.  

Our Mechanic inspected the van, and found the seal on the sliding door was bad, the electric door was sticking at times as the wire harness was missing the clip to the frame, and the dvd was inoperative.  I returned on Tuesday and was told to wait 2 weeks for warranty to kick in, but the seal and chrome was replaced that day.  When I did return 2 weeks later I was told warranty would not cover the items and the total price would be close to $1200.  I kept my cool, and told Sally, the service writer, what my terms were in buying the car, and she apologized, but it was not up to her.  I then asked to talk to a manager and was put in touch with Sean Brooks.  He was GREAT!  He was very busy, but very polite.  All items were taken care of within 48 hours of talking to him.

What I got was an entire team bending over backwards to resolve the issues to my satisfaction.  Mistakes were made by both the dealership and myself in the process too long to detail, but the team was understanding, empathetic, and professional. The issues were quickly resolved.  I was embassassed to have expected the worst and was ecstatic with the resolution and the help of this group as well as the service department.  I walked out once again feeling very good about the experience and the automobile.  Too many times, I have experienced a cavalier attitude from car dealers once the deal is done, but with these guys that was not the case.

421,"December 31, 2010","I was quoted via e-mail a ""drive out"" price of $21300. on a Honda SE CRV by Ricky Smith, Internet Sales Manager.  Ricky and I discussed how much more it would be with leather seats, and he told me $1500 more, again a drive out price.  They would have to install the seats, so I would first come out and pay (it couldn't be done by filling out the finance application and wiring the down payment) and the car would be delivered to me the next day.  I also spoke with Dio Zorilla, my salesperson who assured me that if I drove out to Katy, (a long way from where I live), I would receive that price.  Dio told me over the phone on the day I was going to buy my car (Monday, December 27, 2010) that he was ""looking at it right now"".  When my husband and I arrived, they stalled and then Dion (an inventory specialist) came over with his inventory of cars, none of which were the price of the one quoted by Ricky.  He had us test drive a CRV SE he found on the lot with the color we had requested.  We thought that was going to be our vehicle.  Then we were presented with the price, which was approximately $4,000 more than we were quoted.  They said that it had options on it, as did all of the vehicles on the lot.  First I reminded them that they had quoted me a price and that Dio had told me he was looking at my car when I talked to him that same day.  They had no response to that.  I then asked if they had a CRV on order that we could wait for, and the head Sales Manager, I am pretty sure his name was Wayne, came over to show us  his price list on cars coming in.  He pointed out that we could get his LX model (a model down from what we were promised) for around $23,100.  That was more than we were promised for the higher model, and more than we were quoted from two other Honda dealerships for the LX model with an extra tint!  This is your typical bait and switch sales tactic.  Get the customer to drive out to the dealership, no matter how much trouble it is for them, and then you can change cars and charge them more!  After all, the customer has invested so much time and effort that you can wear them down.  I had asked Ricky and Dio several times before driving to the dealership if this was a real offer, stating that it was an excellent price.  They assured me that it was.   

They should be held accountable for this type of deception.  I will never set foot in their dealership again.

Prior to making the decision to buy the particular model that I decided on, Ryan was very pleasant and informative in my decision process between two similar models. I never felt pressured into one over the other.

I strongly recommend dealing with Ryan if you are going to shop at this dealer.

Otherwise, all of my other experiences here have been on the negative side, both in the sales and in the repair sides. The repair side obviously never test drove my car after repairing it, even the second time that I returned it for the same problem... this is a black eye in my book. Also, the sales managers do not seem to listen to their customers, but constantly try to use sales tactics, that any educated person can see coming a mile away.",3.5
424,"December 13, 2010","I leased a 2011 Honda Accord from Honda Cars of Katy on 11/26/2010. The new cars sales manager Dwain Davis gave me an excellent deal. He is a very friendly, knowledgeable manger to deal with. He accomodated all of our requests in a very professional way. His assistants Javier and Tammy were also very friendly and helpful.
I will definitely recommend Dwain and his staff to all my friends and I will very possibly buy again from them.

All thumbs up to Dwain and his team.

426,"November 17, 2010","I needed a new car since I recently was involved in a major accident with my Chevy HHR and it was totaled by the insurance company.  Living in Katy, my husband & I started on the far West end of I-10 and worked our way east to see what was out there at all the dealerships since we were not planning to buy a new car so soon.

When we arrived at Honda Cars of Katy, we were greeted by Javier Balderas. He's actually in pre-owned sales, but said he could help us with a new car.  He is very friendly and courteous.  We looked at the cars that were in the lot directly in front of the dealership. Javier followed us and kept the conversation going.  We were vague in the answers on the questions he was asking.  As we were about to leave, he asked us if we were familiar with the Insight, Honda's Hybrid car.  Neither one of us were familiar with it. That sparked our interest since we have considered that our next car would be a Hybrid or Electric, but hoping the prices would go down eventually.  We had to go inside the showroom to see it.  We were impressed with the affordable price and gas mileage, but left to finish our shopping down I-10. This was Saturday.

On Monday, I received a call from the dealership about our visit.  I told Tammy, Javier’s assistant, we were actually interested in coming back to test drive the Insight and told her we would be in after work. While waiting for them to find a blue Insight to test drive, we noticed the Honda Fit in the showroom.  We decided to test drive this too. It was reasonably priced and great MPG.  The Insight has great pick up and handles nice, but I did not feel I had good visibility all around the car. The HHR has numerous blind spots and this was a big factor in my next car.  My husband really liked the Insight and did not have a problem with that.

They found a blue Fit for me to drive. It has great pick up for a 4 cylinder and the fact that I had great visibility around the entire car was a plus.  In making the u-turn to head back towards the dealer, I actually did not need someone in the car to tell me that it was safe to go.  All the other cars I had test driven, I had to ask.  That pretty much made up my mind on this car. This car also has a 5-star crash rating and numerous air bags.

I told Javier I was expecting an insurance check for the HHR and already had a pre-approved loan with my credit union to finance the rest.  After the expected haggling on the price of the car and came to an agreement, we went to their finance department to see if they could get a better interest rate.  Justin was just as friendly and courteous as Javier.  He was able to get us a little better interest rate, so we signed the loan with Honda. I was also impressed with Dewayne, the sales manager.  He was not like all the typical sales managers we had encountered on our shopping journey.

427,"October 20, 2010","Biggest issue with this dealership is the sneaky tactics. To start off, I was greeted my Isaiah who greeted me by saying ""Yes sir?"" and looked at me. He was not personable and flat out made me feel uncomfortable. During the test drive, he barely said anything, didn't tell me much about the car, features or anything. Just sat there quiet as if we were waisting his time by test driving the car. Instead of telling me where to go, he stuck his finger and pointed to where he wanted me to turn. He spent more time chatting up with my girlfriend than telling me about the car. 

He gave me prices on a peice of scratch paper and wrote the prices with a black marker all scribbled around the paper. Not too professional. 

Then took me to finance where they just assumed the sale although I had not committed yet, came back and told me I qualified for a special deal and then proceeded to give me prices that were way over what I was quoted from the salesman. I told him I wasn't interested in any of the warranties and told him to give me the monthly payment with nothing added on, he gave me a price that was still much higher than what I was quoted on the internet and by the salesman. I flat out just said no, i'm not going for it and that's when he came out and gave me the actual price with no warranty packages added on. 

Also slapped on $399 lifetime oil change without letting me know about it whcih they do this to everyone. 

The only positive is that Dion (who i had dealt with on the internet) took over the sales process after and was very imformative and helpful after the sale. He really is the only positive comment I have about the experience. ",2.8

429,"September 04, 2010","Contacted dealership from Oklahoma City requesting information on a specific vehicle they had in stock. After jumping through hoops for two days and negotiating we finally agreed on a price. Drove to Tyler, TX which is five hours away from OKC and still five hours away from Houston. Spoke with Salesman, Mo, about a possible meet half way and was immediately dismissed. Called and spoke with Tiffany, one of the managers, who was fabulous. She jumped through hoops with us to get our trade evaluated in Dallas at 8:30 at night. Received message that everything was great and she would call in the morning with a time and place to meet. After staying in a motel in Dallas and wasting time all morning waiting on the phone call we get a call from the General Manager, Scott, who informed us that the car was sold the previous night at 9:45!!! He said that it was his choice and because the paperwork had not been signed the deal was not done. Needless to say we are very unhappy with this dealership and their choice of actions. Everything with the car had been completed, including financing with the bank. The only thing we had to do was meet and sign the papers. I would not trust a thing anyone in this dealership tells you. ",1.4
430,"August 06, 2010","I was interested in the Honda Civic lease deal listed on their website for $0 down at signing, first month payment waived and 35 payments @ $210/month. Wary of any advertised deals, I went to a Honda dealership closest to home. First of all, the car (DX-VP) advertised doesn't really exist in this part of the country per the salesperson I talked to. Then I was informed that although the terms were correct, that if I read the ""fine print"" it says that any additional dealer fees could affect the terms. This means in ""dealers speak"" accessories/options. So in addition to tax/title/license which runs about $1,600 on this car (which I expected to pay), I was expected to pay any accessories/options on top of the $1,600. 

Since they didn't have a DX-VP, I test drive the LX which has a few more standard features. This car had the same lease terms except for $230/month. Liked the car. But when we started talking, the salesperson didn't make it clear if the ""deals"" he could give me was for the DX-VP or the LX. Also the ""deals"" included an ""accessories/options"" package of nearly $1,900 that had to be paid on top of the $1,600. Most of these accessories I didn't care about at all, and the ones I did were way over-priced in my opinion. Oh I could roll in the TTL & options and pay $300/month, or I could get the lease @ $200/month and pay $3,900 up front. They didn't even attempt at any negotiation. But this didn't really surprise me because I expected that an advertised price is just to get you in. 

So learning from this experience, I realized that I would have to pay upfront for accessories/options. Looking at other lease deals for other car brands, they ask for down payments plus TTL which would probably be more than the Honda terms. Plus, as far as I know, they might ask upfront for accessories too. 

I went to Katy Honda. Javier Balderas was my salesperson. I told him about my disappointing experience at the other dealership. He patiently listened to everything I said. I told him I was realistic about the accessories, but I wanted to know what he/Katy Honda can do. Javier was very helpful and right away assured me he could do better. He confirmed that I really couldn't get the DX-VP, but he would let me have the DX at the same monthly terms as the DX-VP and lower the amount of accessories/options to boot! I would definitely recommend this salesperson if you visit this dealership.

After the deal was struck, everything else was a breeze. Buying any kind of a car in the past was a hassle. It took forever to get approval. Then it took forever to get through financing. Then it took forever for the car prep. It was always at least a four to five hour ordeal from stepping into the door to driving out with the car. This time, the whole process took less than 2.5 hours. 

So to sum it up, I think I got a good deal, but like any advertised ""deal"", be wary of the ""fine print"".

441,"February 26, 2010","Having recently moved to Katy we chose the local dealer to service our van.  Turns out we were spoiled in Illinois!

While they had the van Mike called to say that they'd run a bunch of checks and it needed almost $600 worth of fluids and filter changes.  As our van has been 100% maintained as scheduled by Honda dealers, we were surprised to say the least.  After a lengthy discussion we checked with out dealer in Naperville, who faxed the service history to Katy Honda and advised us that he thought the van probably only needed the transmission fluid (one of 5 ""extras"" Mike wanted to do).  The Naperville dealer also advised that we check with the Katy dealer what the maintenance minder (part of the onboard computer) said as far as the service needs were.

When we called Mike back he had the service history and backed down on most of the extras he advised previously.  Most interestingly, he would not answer the question on what the maintenance minder said.

Having visited this dealer twice now and had them try to ""upsell"" us to this extent, we'll be going elsewhere in future, even if it means traveling further to do it.  Dealer service costs are high enough these days without this type of dubious practice.

Spent over two hours picking out a car and when we sat down to pay, the price that they were supposed to match could not be matched. They erroneously quoted the price on a 4 cyl. instead of a 6cyl., they tried to come close but were off by $700.00. They admitted fault of not noticing in the emails that the car being talked about was a 6 cyl. We were given a price and told that it was good for the day of 12/31/2009. We went to another dealer and were given the run around with price again and decided that the deal at Katy Honda was not that bad. We called back to talk to Donna Clark but she had gone home, we talked to the sales manager and told him we were in before and were given a quote that Donna Clark said was good for the day. He called Donna, and told us that she said that the deal was good only at that time and since we refused the deal that the price was off the table. Then we were told that we could have the car if we paid an additional amount. What bothers us is that she lied about the quote being good for the rest of the day as well as giving us a bad quote although that at least had some kind of excuse. Our salesman Thomas that showed us the vehicles that day was a very nice young man that we enjoyed talking with and we were very impressed to meet such a hard working young man.

Judie from Internet Sales contacted me and I said to her what I would like to pay for the ""2009 Honda Accord LX Sedan"". Few minutes later, one of the sales manager contacted me and we couldn't agree on the price. At the end of the call, the sales manager said if any of the Houston dealers can sell for the price I am asking, he said, he can match the price.

The next day, I have contacted around 15 Houston Honda dealers, and finally one specific dealer agreed to sell the car for the price I am looking for (Out the door price including dealer add-on options and TTL). The dealer also sent an email confirming the price (out the door).

Since its too far from my place, I have called Judie at Honda Cars of Katy and told her the other dealer agreed to sell the car for the price that I am looking for. She called me back after few minutes saying that her manager agreed to sell the car for that price.

I have confirmed this two times with her to make sure that they would sell the car for the price I am looking for.

I took the print out of the quote from the other dealer, and went to Honda Cars of Katy and met Judie and showed the printed copy of other dealer quote. She handed over me to a sales person and told that he will take care of me.

I have asked to work on the purchase order first just to make sure I am getting the car for the price they promised me. But the sales person first insisted to see the car and test drive and make sure that I like it.

After couple of hours, they finally came back with a number which is $5000 above the price that they promised over the phone. I have asked about the printed copy of the other dealer quote, he said, the manager already looked into it, and this is the best price they can offer me.

I was so mad and asked to call Judie, but the sales manager said, she already left.

The sales manager insisted that they have added dealer add-ons worth $1500. I have told them even the car the other dealer quoted has the same dealer add-ons. The sales manager also insisted to add TTL, even though the competitor quote clearly says the price is ""out the door - drive out"" (includes dealer add-ons and TTL).

The sales manager says he can't sell the car for that price and suggested that there is going to be some catch with the other dealer (yeah, he thinks every one is like him).

I am OK that Honda cars of Katy doesn't want to sell the car for the price that I am looking for. But the thing that made me so disappointed is, they promised me twice on the phone that they would sell the car for the price I am looking for and treated me like a walk-in customer and completely ignored the other dealer quote and the promise they made me.

This is a very dishonest and unprofessional way on the part of Honda Cars of Katy and I have not expected this from a reputed dealer.

I will send a letter to General Manager of Honda Cars of Katy, American Honda customer Service, and Texas consumer protection board.

When I came down to buy the car, the finance guy Shaun worked up a number.  He tried just to give me a monthly payment. I asked him how it was arrived at.  He started listing the car price and fees, and he included a $399 charge for ""Lifetime"" oil  changes. I told Mo I did not want the oil changes and not to include them.  DON'T think that the oil changes are free.  You are paying in advance for them.  Shaun refused to remove the charge.  I also told him I didn't want to pay the Dealer Inventory Tax, which the state of Texas requires dealers to pay and consumers not to pay.

The service manager Mizo came in and told me I had to pay these items.  I told him I didn't want to but I would negotiate to pay half of the oil change by increasing the car price by $200 and not taking the oil change. I would not pay the DIT.

The floor manager came in and said he was sorry, I had to pay the $400 and the DIT.  I walked out at that point.

The moral to the story - don't let them force you to pay for services you don't want, like an oil change that you won't use, especially if like me you don't live near the dealer.  Also, don't lt ANY dealer make you pay the DIT, or VIT, as the Texas code requires them to pay it not you.",1.0
454,"August 28, 2009","Normally the idea of having to negotiate the purchase of a vehicle with an Automobile Dealer is to say the least, unpleasant, frustrating and overall an undesirable experience.  For many, myself included, there is a sense from the time we set foot on a car lot that we are not going to be dealt with fairly and honestly.  Unfortunately, more often than not; those feelings are confirmed when negotiations begin.  To the detriment of the automobile sales business, the unscrupulous sales person is the rule rather than the exception.  It is for this reason that so many prospective buyers generally have a very low opinion of those in the car sales business. 
 
That being said, I have to admit that I was presently surprised when I walked into the Honda Cars of Katy Dealership and met Jimmy Alarcon.  Mr. Alarcon was pleasant, very personable, honest and straight-forward in his dealings with me.  I would be the first to admit that I am not an easy person to deal with; and I am very suspicious of all sales people in general.  These feeling were even more amplified by the fact that the vehicle I was most interested in was a 2008 Honda Civic; and therefore a used vehicle.  I shared my concerns regarding the purchase of a used vehicle with Jimmy and he went out of his way to address and remedy all of my reservations.  Obviously since he made the sale, he was successful. 

Although I still have an inherent distrust for car salesmen, I would have to say that this experience by far exceeded all of my previous dealings.   This is in no small way a direct result of Mr. Alarcon’s sincere wish to be of genuine service.   Needless to say, when I am in the market again Jimmy and Honda Cars of Katy will be the first names I think of.

He was proud of his move to the area and talked of his family and church.  We later spoke of a basic price and informed him we would be in touch.  Several days later we returned and learned that he had taken the day off.  Another employee contacted him and he still came up to assist us in our purchase and he was there in less than 10 minutes. We took another car out and Jimmy helped in so many ways on showing he cared about our needs.

After I found out that I owed over $4000 more than the cost of my car plus tax, minus my deposit. 

I went back three days later to cancel all the insurance and extra warranties and was told i will get my money in 6-8wks. Its now been almost four months and I still don't have my money.

We moved to Houston in March from Alabama and we were definitely needing a second vehicle.  We don't have the best credit, so we believed that our options were limited to ""tote the note"" dealerships that required nominal cash down payments and excrutiating interest rates.  We were wrong!!!  My husband spoke with Donna on the phone a couple of times and set up a time to come in.  We arrived on a Saturday at 08:50 a.m.  We were greeted and helped immediately by the receptionist.  The salespeople were in a meeting, but as soon as the meeting let out, Javier approached us and found Donna.  She had done her part, so left us with Javier.  This man went above and beyond what was expected of him.  We had limitations financially, so we didn't have cash to put down and weren't prepared to trade because we needed 2 vehicles.  We left the lot with two vehicles and one payment less than $300!!!  Mind you, they were gently used, each had less than 65000 miles on them (which was less miles that our car had on it, 88300).  One was a 2006 model, newer than ours, and the other was a 2001 PT cruiser with low miles in great condition.  We were presented with the CarFax report on each.  He even took the time to walk us through the service department, which, by the way is pristine.  I just have to say that we were impressed and grateful.  We spoke with the GM, Chris, who engaged us for a moment and was genuine and responsive.  We have never had a more positive experience.  We left the dealership at about 3:00 p.m..

472,"June 11, 2009","The story behind my nightmare with this dealership is way too long to go into here.  This is the short version of what happened to me: They stated to me that I was approved through finance to obtain the vehicle of my choice for a certain amount.  Once I drove off the lot, I found a few issues with the vehicle.  I brought it back and requested they take care of the problems I found.  They agreed and took the vehicle in and granted me a loaner car.  I called later in the evening to see if my vehicle was ready for pick-up.  I was transferred to who, at the time, I was told was the ""general manager"".  He stated that there was an issue with the finance company and my deal fell through.  This is after I recieved several calls from Honda Cars of Katy congratulating me on the purchase of my new vehicle.  Secondly, all the documents regarding payment had been signed and it was stated by a member of the finance staff that the deal was approved and the vehicle was mine. I drove straight to the dealership from my job.  The ""general manager"" stated that I actually ""wasn't approved"" and that I would need to pick another vehicle.  I stated that since the financing portion of our deal fell through, I would like to call the agreement null and void and get my trade in back.  He then told me that my trade in was ""broken in to"" and all he could give me for my vehicle was $1.000.  I laughed non-stop for few minutes, composed myself and walked out.  I went back the next morning, a busy Saturday, and stated to the ""general manager"" that he had the choice of giving me my new vehicle intact and repaired of giving me back my trade-in in it's original condition plus my down payment.  They gave me the run around and I ended up calling the police.  All of a sudden, out of nowhere.. I was approved by the finance company!  They magically got them to approve me for a lower monthly payment, when previously I was not approved at all!   The moral of the story: Stay away from Honda Cars of Katy!  ",1.8

From the minute I walked in holding the letter they pretty much acted like it didn't exist and kept trying to sell me a fully loaded Civic using my 2007 Accord as a trade-in valued at $12K or so. Not MSRP at all! When I kept asking about why they wouldn't honor the letter, they threw all sorts of excuses at me, including ""it is not realistic."" Hilarious when they were the ones that sent it. Two issues here, they were unethical in their advertisement, and they kept trying to sell me a car payment. They would not tell me the drive-out price, the interest rate, etc. and these are really the important things to know when buying a car. Not a car payment.

(My car was recently flooded due to massive rain we had earlier in the week.) The service advisor, Sallie, introduced me to Alton, the sales consultant, to see what kind of options were available for me. He sat me down and asked me questions to find out what type of vehicle I wanted and what options I would like. He recommended the EX-L Pilot to me and allowed me to conduct a test drive around the dealership. We then headed back to his office and after 5 mins. he gave me the price of vehicle and an offer for the trade. To my surprise, the price was much lower that the sticker price on the vehicle. Apparently, Alton went to the GM of the store and told him my situation.

I bought a Honda Fit on 20Feb2009, after few days we found the total amount of our loan was added almost US$3000 for the useless warranty, oil change. 

The problem is when I deal with them, they NEVER told me what I am buying. JUSTIN just calculate the total monthly payment and then ask me is it ok.
We don't know that is included the hidden US$3000 fee. 

Just few days after I purchased the car. We requested to cancel the warranty.
At the beginning of conversation JUSTIN refuse our request. And after few days of complain, JUSTIN started to process our request. He said it will take 6~8 weeks to do the refund. But after 8weeks+ we cannot see and refund on the loan. So we called JUSTIN again, and he said it will take 2 weeks more, but this time we don't trust him....and we ask him for any prove, then he said he cannot provice and he dropped my phone call.....

We took a look at a few of them but budget wise I ended up looking at a great Civic with a lot of options and we began the process, It was fairly simple I contacted my credit union and they and the dealership finished most of the process, a few dollars later and a couple of signatures and I was in my new Civic within hours",5.0
477,"April 07, 2009","I am always in the defense mode when I go into a car dealership.  As a woman, I just do not like dealing with car salesmen because I really do not know anything about the size of engines and things like that.  I just know what I like, what I can afford and what I expect out of the car I drive.  

My reservations and hesitations were soon put to rest by my salesmen, David Weingartner and Carl Craig (I talked with them both on different occasions).  With this feeling of distrust in the back of my mind, I proceeded cautiously with the transaction.

I was allowed to take a test drive of the car I wanted, a 2009 CRV, fully loaded.  David Weingartner went over with me all the features of the car with me.  He made sure I understood everything he was telling me and wanted to make sure I was satisfied with his explanations.  When we returned to the dealership after the test drive, we sat down to go over all the paper work and loan application.  

I was very pleasantly surprised that I was able to be financed through Honda, as I am a victim of identity theft and my credit rating has been affected in the negative by this.  

The finance person, Steve Stromatt, was very knowledgeable in what he was doing.  He knew how to explain every piece of paper we reviewed in a way that I could understand it and I felt comfortable signing each piece of paper.  There was no fumbling and rustling of papers.  Steve had everything all laid out, 1-2-3. .. and I was in his office no more than 15 minutes and was ready to drive away in my new car.

My total time in this dealership was no more than 2 hours.  And that time included the time when I went out to drive the car.  After all the paper work was taken care of, a man by the name of Terry got in the car with me and went over all the features inside the car with me.  There was an extensive lesson on the navigation system, as I had never worked with one before.  He allowed me to work with it as he guided me, and explained the pamphlets that go along with the vehicle so that I could find answers I may have later.  He also said that I could come back to the dealership any time with questions I may have, and he would go over them with me and resolve any questions I may have.

My experience at this dealership was unlike any I have had at any dealership before.  I did not leave there, feeling like I had been tricked or lied to.  The dealership is clean; the people there were very friendly and anxious to make sure all my questions and concerns were addressed.

Not only would I recommend this dealership to everyone, I HAVE done so.  My sister was so impressed by my experience that she has thought about coming here from Louisiana to look for her new vehicle.

479,"March 01, 2009","We received a card in the mail for $7000 off a new car at this dealership. Obviously, car dealerships can be pretty gimmicky, so we called them to ask what the catch was, and what vehicles it applied to. We were speaking to Veronica. I specifically made sure to ask first if it applied to all new cars, then if it applied to the Civic (which is what I was interested) in, and then ran mock numbers, literally saying, ""If the Civic costs $18,000, with this card it would be $11,000?""

All of these questions received affirmative responses, followed by requests that I come visit them before they closed (we were calling at 7:45 on a Saturday night, and they closed at 9:00) so that we could get started on the processing of the card and looking at the inventory. My mother and I rushed to get ready and speed down to the dealership to meet Veronica at 8:15. She wasn't there. Instead we were greeted by some girl, then an agent came to us. We discussed my budget, and then showed him the card. He quickly said that for the Civic, and most other models, the actual amount off the price is less--in this case, $2500.

I was not in the market for a new car generally, but the $7000 would have made it worth my while. The agent went three to get managers, returning ten minutes later each time with apologies and ideas for used cars that I could buy in my budget. I had only because the car-searching process and was not at all interested in looking at used cars, especially when the dealership very clearly lied to us to get us to come there.

After thirty minutes of unproductive waiting and talking, my mother and I finally left in disgust. We called afterwards to complain to the management, and eventually got a call back from the manager's manager who at least was courteous enough to admit that Veronica had lied. He tried to sell me on a car even though I'd told him I wasn't interested, and the conversation ended there.

After, we got inside we went and sat down and the salesman went away with a calculator and figured out the drive out price... Since we did not have a calculator , we assumed that the salesman was using the negotiated Selling price as his basis for arriving at the drive out price.

He also stated that in reference to the drive out price, ""This includes FREE oil changes for the life of the vehicle"", at which point we were amazed and even questioned him on it an he stated ""Oh yes, all you have to pay is the tax"".   at this point we are feeling all warm and fuzzy about Honda cars of Katy. 

We go to the Finance department and sign off on the car, feeling that we were getting an awesome deal and FREE oil changes.

It was not until the next day that I went over the numbers again and saw that the selling price had been inflated by $399.00.  I immediately called the salesman and he replied ""Well, you agreed to the drive out price"" and then referred me to finance guy....

Bottom line is they charged us $399.00 for the oil changes.   After numerous calls we finally got a call from the Sales Manager who stated ""Oh we charge everyone for the oil changes"" and he said ""He could not take his oil change card back and refund me my money""

If I would have known that I was buying oil changes from Honda, I would not have purchased them.
