0,"June 17, 2020","I bought a car through TrueCar from Red McCombs Ford.  I bought this car remotely, asked and documented all my questions in writing.  I also asked for photos and a video.  I tried to cover all my bases.  When I received the car it was not the Premium Mustang as listed.  I have pictures of the online posting where it says Premium Mustang with leather seats among other features.  It arrive with no leather seats and when I took it to a local Ford dealership they ran the VIN and said it wasn't a premium.  They printed the window sticker for me.  

Also, the transportation company highlighted a few dents and scratches prior to picking it up.  The dents was covered in black polish which tells me they knew.  Any car person would know, it was one of the first things that I noticed.  Also, when I called the dealership and asked what was serviced on it the woman started reading the notes and then stopped and said I would have to contact someone else.  I tried, but no response.  The car salesman, Roman, stopped responding to my calls and texts.  The dealership, at all leadership levels, stopped responding.  They wouldn't even respond to TrueCar.  

TrueCar said they can put them on probation for misrepresentation, commented on how detailed I was and that was it.  They took zero responsibility as well.  Even if you are local, a leopard doesn't change its spots.  I wouldn't buy or get my car serviced there.  They clearly lied, acknowledged it and now won't make right of their mistake.",1.0

6,"March 24, 2020",We bought a 2015 Altima in December. With approximately 3000 miles on the car we were metal on metal with brakes and had leaking shocks. We parked the car for around 2.5 weeks because it wasn‚Äôt safe to drive and we couldn‚Äôt afford brakes. I then took it to the local shop because I could finance the work for brakes. They fixed them and confirmed (and showed me) that they were metal on metal in the back and close to that in the front. Needed pads all the way around and rotors in the back. That‚Äôs when they showed me the leaking shocks on both sides. I tried to call the manager at Red McCombs 3 times and never received a call back. Then I called the service department and left two messages. No call back. Finally the operator transferred me to someone who was there. They said they would look at the shocks but won‚Äôt reimburse for the brakes because they didn‚Äôt get to look at them. It was unsafe to drive an hour away and I can‚Äôt afford a tow. He said they MAY have paid for the tow after they looked at the brakes. I don‚Äôt have money for MAY. I will never buy a car here again. I dealt with Josh and Cliff in service. I am out almost $500 for brakes. They are doing the shocks after I raised xxxx. Never again. They obviously don‚Äôt inspect cars before they sell them as ‚Äúcertified preowned.‚Äù ,1.0
7,"February 15, 2020",Marcus Venson helped me  and quickly answered my questions  regarding the Ford 150 truck I wanted.  He is an excellent salesman and will be recommending him to my friends and family for their future Ford purchases. I really like the online features of McCombs website. It helps you get an idea of whether someone can afford a vehicle or not.  Thanks Red McCombs !  I really wish I could have talked to the finance people and be able to ask them financing questions since I‚Äôm from out of town.  Are they not allow to talk to customers? Anyway that would have been helpful. ,4.0

13,"November 19, 2019","Fire the Manager named Matt.  He is a liar told us we were not approved for the vehicle we where looking at, kept telling us he was going to help us out on the sticker price and then we could get real close to the payment we were trying to be at.  When I asked him about dealing with Randolph brooks FCU he told me they wouldn‚Äôt approve me and then tried to sell me a different vehicle at sticker price.  Best part was when we were leaving I turned to my wife in quietly told her that instead of wasting the entire day here we should have just went to Southway Ford.  Matt started walking away and then once he got close to the front desk surrounded by all the salesman he started talking loudly and acting like a baboon screaming out.
‚ÄúYes go to Southway Ford we all use the same banks go ahead.‚Äù
I couldn‚Äôt quite figure out why he was so upset about us going to try somewhere else since they wouldn‚Äôt help us.  That is until I saw southway Ford was advertising online $7000 off the exact same expedition we were looking at.  They also had up to $6000 off on the 2020 explorer he was trying to sell us.  I called the bank the next day to find out what they were willing to approve us on and that‚Äôs when they told me they had already approved me for the original vehicle I was looking at yesterday at Red McCombs ford.",1.0
14,"October 23, 2019","I brought my own financing to the deal (3.54%).  Abel in finance convinced me to use their financing (5.64%) based on the fact that I would get a $1500 rebate and he gave me his word I'd be able to refinance right after with my bank.

After doing the deal I found out he was lying.  You can't immediately refinance.  And the rates will be much less appealing.  He cost me $2880 with lies.

I complained and he denied ever saying that.  ",1.8

I saw an elderly customer hand money out to one of the male employees as a XMAS gift ‚Äúbonus‚Äù and he accepted the cash. When my vehicle was ready there was caked up marking in my hood which appeared to be dried up coffee. I had just washed my vehicle the day before and they did not bother to clean up their mess.  I took pictures for evidence. I will never go back nor recommend RedMcCombs to anyone. I plan on going to Cavender and telling them what a horrible job you people do. I don‚Äôt want to ever own a

55,"November 15, 2018","Was not very happy this time around with my service .
Took my vehicle in for oil change and tire rotation. I had the understanding that other stuff was checked accordingly, like battery, fluids, filters.  Apparently , this was not the case, although my paper work said everything was checked and in good standing. However  the following day my car did not start while I was out grocery shopping . Come to find out the cables were heavy corroded due to battery leaking. Apparently this was NOT checked @ service . It couldn‚Äôt not have been missed , had they checked correctly. So then I had to come back the following day to get this problem fixed, and I missed out on my Son‚Äôs soccer game that day . Which was very upsetting to me. Could have been avoided if service was done efficiently. I must say my service rep. was very helpful in getting problem fixed. ",2.4

171,"June 07, 2018","I bought my 2018 Ford Fusion Hybrid SE from McCombs on 3 March 2018. On 6 March 2018, I returned to the dealership to return the vehicle for something else as was stated on the flyers everywhere throughout their dealership, on the commercials and the ""peace of mind"" provided to me in dialogue. My experience over the last 3 months has been wrought with conflict at the GM level, lies of an exchange as stated by them to get me to close my BBB complaint and the list goes on. I wanted to stop by and get my license plates and talk about an exchange (understanding that they would be low-balling me with a trade-in vice exchange) and I was told ""I wouldn't do that!"". 

In the end, I traded the car in at Beorne Dodge Jeep for the same vehicle that I was willing to ""trade-in"" for at McCombs. My Beorne experience was AMAZING, especially considering the roller-coaster of a ride McCombs put me through. I have had less than perfect car purchases in the past but never a bad deal and a bad experience. McCombs was my first BAD car buy in 2 decades of car buying experience. 

The issue that hit-home the most was the pretense of an exchange only to be insulted with a trade-in appraisal. Many other dealerships offer the chance to ""own"" for up to 7 days since a loop around the dealership is not always enough to know if a vehicle is right for the buyer, especially given the ""investment"" they represent. I returned within the touted 3 days and it still was not enough to net an exchange. Water under the bridge for me since the car has been traded-in somewhere other than McCombs but it should be noteworthy for potential buyers to consider other dealerships. ",1.0

After my making me come in and my vehicle not being done when they said, they ordered the wrong parts, then told me my truck now stops and theyd have to charge me a diagnostic fee to see what was wrong or i could pick it up as is.   My vehicle did not have this problem before bringing it in.  After alot of back and forth they waived the diagnostic fee but then tell me i have to pay an additional $700 to fix a problem that didn't exist before hand.   I wanted to was my hands of this company and the horrible experience so i just gave in.   Now after ""fixing"" the problem they tell me it runs funny. So you can prob guess where this is going but they now tell me i have to pay an additional $600 for a problem that didnt exist and wasn't on their diagnostic.   The problem is still ongoing because i havent gotten my vehicle yet.   Its been 2 weeks since the truck was dropped off.   I was treated better by the Afghan people than i have been by this company.  Side note i also have a Caddilac and i have never had problems with service from them.  ",1.0
181,"March 01, 2017","So I get starry-eyed when I get approved for a vehicle. Two weeks later I get a ""There are some income issues...we need to see you!"" I go in thinking it wasn't a big deal...they lied when giving my info to the creditors and try putting me in something I didn't want. So embarrassed I had to empty what I thought was my new vehicle to still have to wait for them to find my plates from the car I was using as a trade-in. Needless to say they couldn't find them and issued me temp. paper plates...but just left me there...didn't apologize. .no empathy...nothing. And other salespeople still trying to ""See what they could do for me."" Why was I allowed to drive off in a vehicle if I hadn't qualified. .just to have the rug pulled out from under me. Is that how they do business? Very unprofessional.....thoroughly disappointed...never recommending them to anyone.

182,"January 17, 2017"," Obviously If I could leave a -5 stars I would. Josh Hamman stay away from this liar. If he approaches u to help with your vehicle ask for someone else. Better yet go to another dealership if you can. He was a horrible lying service advisor that apparently pays off at red McCombs because since I last spoke to him he has been promoted. Bottom line is if you are a minority and you go there be prepared to be lied to and be talked.down to by Josh Hammon. Just to.give two quick examples of what I'm talking about. My husband took our 2014 Taurus for a problem with the lane keeping and Vehicle Gap systems. Josh told us it would be a few days to get it repaired. My husband told him since the car was goinf to be there at the service department for  few days if they could ahead and do an oil change on it because it was due. When they called us that our car was ready for pick up, My husband noticed two things with the car, the oil change had not been done and next he only had 2 miles until the gas was empty. He brought it up to the attention of Josh and he was quick to tell my husband  that their policy states they are not responsible for the fuel that is used when diagnosing customers vehicles. My husband was disappointed with his answer and told Josh he understood their policy but 2 miles left to empty, really? He asked Josh, what if I dont make it to the nearest gas station that's on Wurzbach/I10 which is every bit of 2 miles away from the dealership? Who's going to come get me if I get stranded on the side of the road? Josh told him it wasnt his problem. My husband left the service department and went directly to the quicklane to get the oil changed on the car and the Customer service Rep at Red Mcombs quicklane tells my husband, ""Sir do you realize  you only have 2 miles on your car before it's empty. My husband explained to him that they had left our car like that at the service department after they had worked on it and that Josh told him they didnt need to put gas in it after using up our gas. The quicklane representative  told.my husband, ""Oh no, this isn't acceptable to me and this isn't going to happen on my watch. He called over to Josh in Service and after talking to him, Josh came over and apologized to my husband and said that it wasnt his decision not to put fuel in our car but it was company policy and had talked his boss into allowing him to put $5 of gas so that he could make it to the gas station. The second example was when I brought my car in for a license plate light fixture broken and the plastic panels on the seats were also broken. I went to a different advisor as we didn't want to deal with Josh any longer. It was a Friday morning and the advisor was more interested on what kind of tacos they were going to bring him than taking care of the customers. When he finally took down my concerns he tells me, "" Well we are short handed today so because I have extended warranty we will give you a rental but we wont get to your car probably until Monday. Well, I didnt receive a call until Tuesday and it was Josh Hammond. He told me none of the parts on my car that were broken were warrantied items and therefore the extended warranty wasnt going to pay for the rental that we ended up having for 5 days. We argued back and forth about it and during our argument Josh tells me that if I had come to him instead of someone else on friday, he could have told me on that day that those parts would not be covered undet watranty like that helps me with the $150 rental I have to pay for now. I talked to his manager and he told me they would pay for the parts and replacement of the car seat plastics but would not help me with the cost of the rental. Josh told me he would call me when the parts came in. Well we never got a call from him and we got busy with our daily.lives and now 3 months later I call to see about getting it done and get a recall on the car done at the same time and now they are refusing to do it  because Josh is claiming they returned the parts back to Ford. Josh Hammond is now saying he called me yet there are no missed calls on my phone from him or even any messages on my voicemail. I've called him numerous times throughout our whole experience and always had to leave voicemails because he was never available. Keep in mind this is a business and I would think that if he actually attempted to reach us by phone like he claims.to have done and we didnt answer that he would leave a message. I believe that Josh actually forgot about us and those parts got sent back after 30 days and now he is afraid to answer for it to his superiors. Did he blow us off because of our ethnicity or is this just a lack of proffessionalism on his part. I surely don't know but I bet his superior Jessie Zuniga does because I'm certain we aren't the only ones he has done this to. Also want to mention Jessie isn't a person that's willing to work with his customers either. He backs up everything Josh tells him because when we called her seemed to have already made up his mind on anything we wantef him to have an open mind on.",1.0

They were trying to take advantage of us saying that that was the law, when that is not true; and also saying that that paper was not legally valid, they just wanted me to sign without a reason. It took somebody to finally stood up to say that wasn't true about the Law to have them say that it really wasn't the law but a company policy (after 4hours!!! That's when they say all this).

We were told the diagnostic wold be 125.00 which was fine. We left our truck there over night and by 4:00 the next day my husband called and told Isaac that we wold be picking it up so we could get a rental and everything settled then we wold bring it back for repairs. As soon as I walked in and told Isaac that I was there for the truck he stated that he spoke to my husband and my husband said we were not picking up the truck. I got my husband on speaker phone where Isaac admitted that YES my husband called him and that we were picking up the truck. I arrived at the shop at 4:00 and asked Isaac for a print out of what needed to be replaced on the vehicle with part numbers and amounts. He stated he could not give that to me until I do the repairs. I explained to him that I was paying 125.00 for a diagnostic on my vehicle and for 125.00 I wanted a print out prior to paying the 125.00. He was very aggressive with me arguing that he was unable to provide a print out to me. I was there for over an hour and half. During this time Isaac told me he had other customers and had to deliver service tickets which was fine but he just disappeared. i had to grab another employee to help me. Isaac finally came back and stated that my truck would now not start at all and that I could not leave with it. During this time he continues to REFUSE to give me more detail or even a detail sheet on their findings. I asked to see my keys and he refused stating I had to pay 125.00 first. I told him I know but since I have been here for almost two hours that I just needed to get my house keys off so I could get a ride to go pick up my son from day care. He slammed down my keys on his desk. I  left the dealership still unable to pay for my diagnostic because he still refused to give it to me. I called the service department several times after I left. I left a message for the manager but have yet heard back from him. I finally spoke to Isaac again and he argued with me, talked over me and got very aggresive on the phone stating how do I expect him to give me a print out now since I left. I told him I have been there for almost two hours and in that two hours I asked him 6 times for the print out and he refused. I  told him I was not paying the 125.00 until I got something in writing. He then stated that my  truck would not be released to the tow service until I paid it. Finally after 10 more minutes of arguing he said how do you want me to send it. I gave him my email and asked him if he was sending it now. He said he had other things he needed to do. I told him that they are about to close and I need to pay the 125.00 NOW so that my vehicle could be released. He finally emailed me and without saying a work transferred me to the cashier. First of all we purchased this truck from them, we get ALL of our service done there and so do our parents. I have never been treated this way at any business before.

201,"July 28, 2014","I had to have my vehicle towed to this service center this morning in order to replace two blown out tires which were covered under the ""road hazard"" warranty.  I was not contacted until after 5 pm to be told that the warranty would only cover 125 per tire and I would be responsible for the difference.  Which is no big deal until they tell you the replacement tires cost 318 a piece plus tax.  Of course I have no other choice but to tell them to go ahead and replace them.  Then I was told they would try to get it done by closing time/7 pm.  I then received a phone call at  630 pm asking if I could make it before 7.  I told the guy I would be about 5 minutes past 7 to which he replied that's fine. It should be done before 7.  So my wife and I head to the dealership getting there at exactly 705pm and as we are walking to the service center door a service center personnel locked the deadbolt.  My wife proceeded to knock on the door but  we just watched as the people inside ignored us.  I then called the number I received the phone call prior to that and was transferred to the switchboard. When I pressed ""3"" for service I was then transferred to a Voicemail.  So infuriated at this point I go to the sales dept. and ask if they had a direct line over to the service center because I had just received a call and was told to pick my car up.  To no avail they responded by suggesting we knock on the door and my wife explained we had already attempted that but they did not answer the door even though it was apparent they were still in there.  So my wife and I decide to leave.  No sooner do I get out of the parking lot do I receive a phone call from the salesman who had contacted me and told me to pick my vehicle up who asked if I had made it to the service dept. yet.  I told him I had just left since they shut and locked the door in my face.  He said it was just as well because after they had installed the new tires they had discovered the wheels had been bent to the point where they would not hold air.  I asked him why they were just discovering that when I had asked earlier and was told the wheels had not sustained any damage.  The salesman proceeded to tell me he had only looked on the outer portion of the wheel so he assumed the wheels were not cracked/bent.  So that tells me my car sat outside until 630 when they got the tires and only discovered the extent of the wheel damage after they called me to pick up my vehicle.  That or they are trying to get over on me and sell me  two brand new 22 inch wheels for 350-400 a piece.  Tell me how I purchased an additional warranty to cover my car bumper to bumper yet the ""Road Hazard"" warranty for the wheels/tires will only cover up to 125 dollars per wheel/tire!?!?!

218,"November 26, 2012","I took in my 2005 Ford Expedition for low idle issues on 11/20. My service advisor was Victor Lacourse (sic) The next morning he  called me to advise that he had good news, I had been pre-approved for their &quot;vehicle buy back program&quot;. I asked him to explain what that was and he basically tried to talk me into trading it in!  I indicated that I was not interested in trading in the vehicle and just wanted it fixed. He was very persisitent about me trading it in and I stayed firm. I was irritated that he seemed more interested in selling me a new car versus telling me what was wrong with my vehicle. He reluctantly explained that the throttle body had gone bad and total for labor and parts would be nearly $1500, including new brakes. I advised I would speak to my husband and let him know. I decided to pay Red McCombs for the diagnostic ($125) and take my car elsewhere for a second opnion. At the advice of a friend, I took it to Santa Ana #2 7626 Culebra Rd and explained the problems I was having to mechanic by the name of Edgar. He also did diagnostic test. ($45) The next day Edagr called to say that throttle body was still good, just a little dirty and he cleaned it and now car was running fine. I paid $335.02 for new front/rear brakes and the cleaning of throttle body switch. My car is running perfectly and I am still getting calls from Red McCombs pressuring me to trade it in. I advised them on last call to remove my name from their database and I felt that they were more interested in selling cars than they were repairing them. I plan to tell all my friends and family about how Red McComs treats loyal customers. FYI: My husband and I have been taking both of our Ford vehicles to Red MCombs for the last 8-10 years and ever since Toby left the service dept, service has gone downhill. I will never take my vehicle here again. When I do get ready for my next new Ford vehicle, I will stay clear from any Red McCombs dealership, thats for sure! ",1.0

Out of all of these, my experience with Eric @Red McCombs was absolutely awesome, enjoyable & unlike any other interaction purchasing a car that I've ever experienced. He was real, down to earth, caring. I owe this gentleman and/or business nothing, so I can reassure you my  words are genuine when sharing my experience. I am still in awe at my experience at Red McCombs. I was expecting the ""nice act"" to change at any time & the ""vice grip ""to tighten at any time; that never happened. The kindness & respect remains even after the sale. Eric even reassured me that meeting with the finance specialist eould be nice but I was nervous due to previous ""bullies"". Mike Dannelly was not only nice, he was so helpful with assisting me on the internet gathering needed documents; he was also kind &respectful. No pressure. No bullies. No game playing.

225,"September 17, 2012","We were looking for about a month for a specific car, a black on black Pontiac G8. We found the car we were looking for on a website that sent us to Red McCombs Ford. We contacted the dealership by phone and spoke to David DelGreco who then set us up with Cliff DeLeon to be our salesman. We set an appointment with Cliff and drove from Corpus Christi to San Antonio to see the car. Cliff had the car ready when we got there, and it was exactly what we were looking for. To be honest, we spent a little more on it than we expected, but it was exactly what we wanted. Cliff made the sales process so easy and worry free we felt very comfortable. The car did not have tint on the windows, but they agreed to throw the tint in for free.

240,"October 11, 2011","I bought a nice blue 2007 nissan titan from this place in May, 2011.  The deal and the salesman were both very good.  When I went to finance they pushed me real hard to buy an extended warranty.  They told me how great it would be, that most of their customers bought it, and how it would literally pay for itself down the road if I have any problems.  So for an extra 1900 dollars I purchased it.  
 Then in early september, my fuel pump went out, the horn stopped working, and I also had problems with the key fob.  So I brought it in on a saturday and was told they would take care of it.  Late saturday evening I was told that the warranty would not cover any of the cost.  I spoke with the dealer finance manager Brandon Brady and expressed my displeasure with the warranty they had given me.  I felt they were very misleading.  
 He said I would be upgraded to the ford premium warranty with no cost and after a week or two my truck would be fixed.
 This 6 weeks ago.  With in this time frame I have called the dealership numerous times, spoken with Brandon Brady, Andy Dillon, and numerous other employees there.  I have been told they would check into it and call me back.  I haven't received any phone calls back.  And still I do not know what is happening with my truck or the warranty.
I cannot emphasize enough how displeased, angry, and upset I am.  I truly like to give people the benefit of the doubt and give them the opportunity to make things right but this dealership has failed miserably.
 It just shows me that they are only interested in selling you a vehicle and after that you are strictly o'n your own.  Worst case of customer service I have seen in a long time.  Six weeks since I took my truck in and not only can tell me nothing they don't return my calls.  
 I would not suggest this dealership to anyone.

243,"May 18, 2011","PATHETIC EXCUSE OF A DEALERSHIP AND SALES TEAM! 

LAST WINTER:

My partner and I purchased 2 used vehicles from Red McCombs Ford last year. During the process we asked the car salesman if the vehicle had ever been wrecked. The car salesman confidently stated NO! We asked for a CarFax report but during the process we became so excited we didn't think about it not being given to us. Later that evening we leave with our cars‚Ä¶


PRESENT DAY:

One our way to Austin the other day we decided to stop at one of the Ford dealerships going up there and take a look at a new 2011 F-150. We were not looking to purchase but it just so happened that we wanted to buy the truck. They take our vehicle that we had purchased last year from Red McCombs Ford and then come back with the appraisal. They told us the appraisal was low because the vehicle had been wrecked not once but TWICE!!! My partner and I were shocked. The salesman showed us the AutoCheck report and there it was... two accidents reported. We decided that we had to pursue this with Red McCombs Ford.

The next day I called Red McCombs ford to speak with a used car manager. Twice I was sent to voicemail. The second time I left a very detailed message of the incident and my call back number. The manager never called back. Later that evening my partner and I went to the dealership to speak with the used car manger. First off, he didn't even shake our hands and gave us this ""who cares"" look as we explained to him the issue. We stated we wanted to resolve this matter with the dealership before seeking legal counsel. He told us it didn't matter what we did and that HALF the vehicles on the lot had been WRECKED!! REALLY???? The only resolution he offered was to take our vehicle and trade it with another vehicle. I said no because he was obviously going to screw someone else with selling it again and attempt to make money off us. We told him we had called and left him a voicemail and he said he checked but he received nothing. LIAR LIAR LIAR!!! Now we have to seek further legal counsel to resolve this matter. 

PLEASE DON'T BUY FROM THEM. THEY ARE GRADE A CONS AND WILL DECEIVE YOU!

There are plenty of other Ford dealerships in the area to purchase from!

I can't remember the gentleman's name (Asian looking) but he was able to point out a few of the 4x4's in the lot.  The cars don't have prices on them and the detailed info is sparse re: milage, year etc.  We found two and wanted to know what their ""asking price"" was.  We were invited inside and sat at his cubical and were shortly introduced to the ""Sales Manager"".  He asked what we were looking for, how much we wanted to spend and which truck we liked.  We explained that we were out comparing the different truck styles, diesel, flex fuel etc...and were not ready to buy just then.....I might add we are both medical and can easily afford anything on their lot.   He simply said, Okay then, stood up, shook our hands and walked us out the door.  HE REFUSED TO GIVE A PRICE!!!!!!  I couldn't believe it and neither could my husband.  We will NEVER, NEVER, NEVER do business with Red McCombs again.  EVER!  Slap shot personnel and you can assure they have scraped the very bottom on the work barrel to staff the sales and management department.  If I were the McCombs family,, I would reevaluate this management, sales, and social style.  Until then I will share my experience with anyone out car hunting.

BUT, when I arrived at Red McCombs Ford and met with Ken. He showed me the Exact Fusion he quoted in the email. Ken made the negotiating part VERY simple and pleasant.

But I understood that other employees at other locations may get off work at 5pm so I came back the next day. I was immediately handed off to another ""salesman"". The very first thing he said was that the $7500 off was only good for in stock mustangs. Of course that was NOT what I was told the day before.  If I had been told the deal was only for in stock cars , I would not of even been there because there were not any in stock cars I was interested in the day before and I had only come in because the original salesman had said we could look for another mustang from other locations.  Whether you call it a bait and switch or a flat out lie , I was still willing to get a price quote if they could find me a car.  But all the salesman would say was "" what can I do to get your business?"" He was pushy and would not even listen because I repeatedly told him what would get my business. A specific price quote on a specific car. After about the 10th time he asked what could he do to get my business ( and me repeatedly telling him ) I walked out. The lieing , pushy attitude , not even pretending to listen to the customers needs , and NOT honoring an original offer are reasons so many people hate car salesmen.
