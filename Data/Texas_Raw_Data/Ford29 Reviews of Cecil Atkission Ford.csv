Within 15 minutes Katy and Kameron Zepeda had found just what we were looking for. Such an easy process working with them and we have NEVER bought an automobile so easy and fast! Thanks y’all ,5.0

2,"November 26, 2019","Best and smoothest automobile purchasing experience ever. Starting with Katy via internet who actually came in on her day off to check with us to our actual dealership visit where Jacob and Kellsie were extremely professional and inviting all the way to the final financing where Al took care of us. I will definitely be back and will be sending anyone we know needing a vehicle that way. 
Thank you folks.

The entire process took only two hours much faster than Ken Stoeple Ford.  I would recommend Bob to everyone! My Daughter is looking so I will let her talk to them,5.0

So I have been going where my mom takes her Ford SUV’s for years as they are 11 years old and 20 years old. I live now in Kerrville and come to town to a place I trust to take care of my SUV . Always feel I am taking good care of ... both James and Tracey listen and take care of business professionally

13,"January 19, 2019","We purchased a new Ford Edge Sport from Cecil Atkission Ford. Becky, our sales consultant, was awesome (as always)! We are always made to feel like we are family members when we are in to shop for a new vehicle or when we are getting one of our Fords serviced. Cecil Atkission Ford has been our exclusive Ford dealer for the past 15 years and we would not consider purchasing at another store. If you want a great purchasing experience, without the pressure tactics or hassle, Cecil Ford should be your Ford store!
Well done, Becky, Scott and the Cecil Ford Team!!!!",5.0

21,"October 10, 2017","Hello my name is Mike Merz and I just want to say thank you to the amazing team at Cecil Atkission Ford in Hondo Texas!!
These guys really treat you right, Tim Carter and Brian Moore are absolutely phenomenal.
They were knowledgeable, patient, helpful and made sure that my first new truck purchase was awesome!! 

Last year I purchased a 2017 Surburban at Gunn Chevrolet, I would put the entire staff at Cecil Atkission Ford in Hondo against them because they would beat them hands down!

Thank you Cecil Atkission Ford in Hondo, TX for making my experience so great all of you guys were awesome and I genuinely appreciate the service! And thank you Tim and Brian, you guys are awesome and I appreciate the amount of time you both dedicated to me, and making sure that I was happy and got the truck I wanted!

25,"October 31, 2016","I recently contacted the Kerrville Dealership location via internet request for more information. I dealt with dealership via texts, regarding a 2015 Chevrolet Pick Up that was at your Kerrville location.  

The reason I am upset is because I was told that I could come look at this specific truck, Saturday, October 29th.  Once I arrived at the dealership for my appointment, Salesman took my information down and asked me about my trade in. They appraised my car prior to me being told that the truck I had driven to see was not at this location. Salesman explained to me that he did not realize that the very truck I had made an appointment to look at was taken to the Burnet location that morning. Mind you my appointment was at 10:00 AM. I feel that I should have been contacted prior to my appointment to let me know of this change. 

I feel that if I were the owner of this company, I would like to be made aware of situations like this. 

I drove over an hour to get to Kerrville, Texas when Burnet, Texas is 30 miles away from me.

26,"May 13, 2016","On 5-12-16 I took my Mom and Dad to the Hondo  Ford Dealership because of a mail out my mother recieved telling her she won a cash prize.

Upon we were greeted by a young man dressed very sloppy and dirty. My mom and dad both in the late 80's wanted to look at a new Exployer. The young very unprofessional salesman brought up a frie bronze Exployer. I watched this guy do a sales pitch about this vehicle. As I approached the vehicle after about 10 to 15 minutes I noticed that there was very extensive hail damage to this new vehicle. I ask the salesman whom had not said a word to my mom and dad about the damage AND HE SAID YES BUT HE WOULD REDUCE THE PRICE. This was a total lie. After trying to pressure my Dad into buying this damaged new vehicle another salesman older man came to the table and began putting an enormous amount of pressure on Dad to by this damaged vehicle.  This crook lying decepitive person told them he had reduced the vehicle and once he showed the pricing there was not reduction for the damage. Also they offered my dad 3,000 for his trade in and that in 
was also trying to steal his trade in.   We found out later that the people there were not full time but a carnival crew of lying salesman from out of state and when we left we felt like that was the worst experience of our life and we will never reccommend that dealership to anyone for anything.  That was and is criminal you should be ashamed of the way my mom and dad were treated. It was a Carnival Circus Joke Ripoff.   ",1.0
27,"December 30, 2015","They use a very deceptive add mailing to get people to drive from all over the state to visit their showroom under the pretense that they've won $1,500 when actually all they've one is a chance to spin a wheel for $1 to $500 worth of prizes.  They say their advertising is legal, but nowhere on the mailer does it say you may not have actually won the prize that you scratched off.  And to think, they acted very surprised when I and another customer where not happy with this tactic.  If they are this deceptive in their advertising, just think how deceptive they might be with their Sales Deals.",1.0
28,"February 21, 2015","On February 17 2015,  I went looking for a vehicle. the seller of Cecil Atkission Ford, showed me an expedition, but they did not let me drive it, I was told that the brakes need it to be adjust. They persuaded me to sign the contract and to buy the vehicle, Even though the car was not ready, and had not passed the state inspection. I was told the next day the car will be ready. Four days later on February 21,2015 I when to the dealer the car was still not ready, I asked the general manager, Javier Gonzales to unwind me from the contract due to the situation of the vehicle and how the whole deal was handle buying a car that was not drivable and was not fully disclosure prior to purchase. He yelled at me was upset for losing the sale. I asked to speak to his boss ""Scott Barlow"" the General manager, he was very controlling about the whole situation, he was raising his voice at me right from the beginning because I requested to be unwind from the contract  I was not satisfied that the car was not ready. The general manager Scott Barlow threatened to arrest me, he showed me a batch from the police and said he was the top authority, and he throws me out of the premises. he called the police alleging I was disrupting the peace. He clearly invented that so that he could not release me from the contract, and keep holding me liable; All because the dealer could not lose the sale. He did not care to look over my interest or my experiences as a buyer. He humiliated me and my family. I walked out of there in tears, with a contract of 60 months $5000 less, that's what I gave as a down payment, and without the car. All because Scott Barlow thought that by having a constable badge and being the General Manager could take advantage of the customers. Mr. Barlow forgot the ethics to be the general manager, and the rights of the consumers.
I had the worst experience as a buyer, because the people in charge of Cecil Atkission Ford at Hondo, Texas took advantage of me, and sold me a vehicle not drivable.
