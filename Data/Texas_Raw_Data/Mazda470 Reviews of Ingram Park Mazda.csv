29,"January 28, 2019","My hat is off to Blake Heggie. 
He is a well mannered, straight forward, courteous professional sales Director.
Bottom line about buying a car to me is what it is all about once you have decided on the equipment of the model you want.  No games, just some back and forth, give and take but in the end a deal I could live with – incidentally the same deal I had indicated going in that would be the only one acceptable to me.
Loved their sales price, dealer discounts and the rebates!  No name calling, no long waits, still lots of paperwork, but I have to say, they really want to sell you a car! 
Joe, keep up the good work, you'll be a sales Director someday.

86,"January 17, 2018","Beware!!! extremely incompetent when it comes to cross communication with in their organization.  I took them 4 weeks after the due date to process my first payment!!

Back story: I went in for a recall for my new 2018 Mazda, while I was there I was told that it was time for my first payment on the car and that I can pay at the dealership. So I paid my first payment on 18 December 2017 for a due date of 20 December 2017. I finally got the physical bill in the mail on 19 December and set my account. I waited a week to see if the payment I made posted but still nothing so I called Mike at Ingram Mazda to see what was going on and they kept on saying it must have gone through and that Mazda capital must have messed up. 3 weeks later in January, payment still hasn't gone through and now have a late fee on my account. I finally called the Sarah at accounting and was told that they mistaken the payment as a down payment instead of a first payment. The payment finally went through on 17 January 2018 when I originally made the payment on 18 December 2017.

I have never expierenced such a let down as this. From beggining to end they did not keep their end of the bargain. I gave full disclosure of my situation and we agreed on a deal. They told me the deal 💯done, had me clean out my car sign papers sent me on my way feeling great, just break their word and second time, a week later call me to finalize the deal just to get me in to return the car bc they couldnt keep their end of the bargain. How emberassing. If they werent sure they shouldnt of gone to my wifes job to sign off on the lein, nor clean out my car and send me driving around proudly showing off their new car (as mine) and should of told me to stay in my car until they could finalize the deal. Pablo ""the enforcer"" was straight forward and to the point. I wish i dealt with him first. Eddie sales and Joey Sales Manager ""FOS"" becareful of they tell you what you want to hear and give you their ""word"" and even shake hands and ask you to sign your commitment with them, with no worries if they keep their end of the deal.

I test drove quite a few different vehicles on the lot and Matt never made me feel like I was a nuisance nor like I was wasting anyone's time!

I did not purchase the vehicle right away because I had intended visiting other dealerships, and during that time Matt & Pablo did not hassle me one bit! They did keep in touch but it wasn't annoying one bit! Pablo helped me so much with working with my budget as well which was top priority for me!

Most car dealerships that I've been to are like hungry sharks in the water waiting for the smallest drop of blood: high pressure, fast talking, judgmental, and yes, even deceitful. None of them in the past where willing to work with me even though I always look for a car that is WAY BELOW what I'm able to afford so I can make my payments. When I went to this dealership, I didn't even expect to buy a car. First, off I met Matt Martinez outside because they always seem to have someone outside to meet their customers and make them feel welcomed. Matt asked some questions and took some notes to get a better idea of what I'm looking for. Next, we went to go and look at some cars. We found one I liked and we took it for a test drive. Then, the paperwork began and I was thinking, ""Here's where the process ends."" But, then Joey Esparza came in and talked to us. He and his managers were able to work out a GREAT DEAL for us that was far beyond our expectations.

There was no ""car salesman harassment"" just questions on what I was looking for, and answers for what I asked. He spent a good chunk of his day trying to help me get situated. It wasn't so much ""make me money"" as it was ""how can I help you today"" and I truly appreciated that. I eventually left with a Grey 2017 Manual Mazda 3. Matt made sure I was taken care of, even to the extent of driving my vehicle home for me since I didn't know how to drive. On top of that, Mr. Karl as well took really nice care of me when he didn't have to and assured me he was there for me. Both went above and beyond any expectations I could have had for them and they deserve to be recognized for their great work done as does Jeff for the great work he always provides.",5.0

Daniel Cardenas listened and showed me several vehicles in my selected category. His knowledge of each was very impressive. To top it of, he made me feel at ease and comfortable with his great sense of humor. I had a vacation planned & timing for pick-up was a challenge. Daniel solved that by delivering the vehicle to my home (on a weekend) so it would be waiting for me at my return. Now that is service! Karl was great in helping me lock down the details of the purchase. Kimo, in finance, made sure I was comfortable with the financing. The initial institution selected was a bank I refuse to do business with, it would be a deal breaker. He immediately found a different bank that I was comfortable with at the same terms.

 Car shopping had never been fun for us until we went to IPAC Mazda about 5 years ago. We've worked with some good sales consultant's in the past @IPAC Mazda  , but not like 
Mr. Joey Esparza who made us feel comfortable at the showroom and he showed us around and guided us through the available cars there ....

I must say that this was my best car shopping experience ever. The salesman was very informative and he was answering very question of ours patiently.

Nowadays, it commonly seen that car salesmen just don’t do enough good job and their only objective is to get money out of your wallet. But, salesman like Joey Esparza  delivers an incredible service and gives a very pleasant experience. ALL AROUND COOL GUY.
As for me, our familes and friends IPAC Mazda will always be our 1st in choice and ONLY dealership to buy all  our vehicles at. We've bought 5+vehicles and now in the process of buying a vehicle for our oldest. 
Thank you so much Joey Esparza, Pablo Serna, Mike Moreno @ IPAC Mazda

430,"November 12, 2013","Horrible service. Ever since I have purchased my vehicle I have been having problems. The service advisors are rude and lie. Have taken my vehicle in about 4 times in the last month and a half. First it was for a jerking problem on my jeep. They gave it back to me and told me they couldn't feel what I was talking about. So I took it and not even a mile down the road I felt the jerking. I ended up fixing it myself, turned out to be a misfire, something ""technicians"" should have been easily able to diagnose and fix. Now, I am currently having a problem with my heater not working as well as an overheating issue. I scheduled an appointment to have it looked at. When I got there and told Daniel, one of the service advisors, about the issues I was having (and physically showing him) I was told they may not be able to even look at my vehicle that day, but I could wait if I wanted to,  as I would not be getting a loaner car because they are only for Mazda owners. I explanied to him the heater issue was something that was supposed be fixed when i had first purchased the vehicle and that I had recieved a loaner car when they were first fixing the problem (it was never fixed). He rudely told me he didn't know why they would have given me one and that I was not going to get another one. Later, he told me I would not even be able to get a rental car thru my warranty as they would not be able to diagnose it and the warranty would not cover it until that was done. He told me I could take my vehicle home and bring it back early one day so they would have a full day to diagnose it. So two days later, on Saturday,  I had my wife drop off the vehicle (I was working) as soon as they opened. I recieved a call from Ernest, another service advisor around 430 pm saying that they could not find anything wrong with it,as far as the overheating, even though me and my wife both showed them it was overheating while it was overheating. So, then what he (ernest) told us is that we could leave it there for the weekend and they'd check it monday or, I could take it and bring it back monday or tuesday. He also said, he would give me a loaner car until it got diagnosed and the warranty approved a rental car for me. My wife took it in tuesday (today) morning, less than an hour after they opened as he said they'd have a loaner car to give me on tuesday, he wasn't to sure if they'd have one monday. Surprise, no loaner car. He said they would have one this evening. So they offered my wife a ride home. They then got in MY VEHICLE (the one they said they wouldn't recommend me driving) and dropped my wife off ar home. I waited for a call. Nothing. Called the service dept. twice to try to get a hold of ernest. He did not answer, I left a message. I called again and got ahold of Daniel. He then informed me that ernest was gone for the day. Awesome right? I told him what ernest told me about the loaner car. He quickly assured me I would NOT be recieving a loaner car from him. He then put me on hold as he called ernest. He told me that ernest said I wasnt getting a loaner car until the warranty approved it. Which I'm guessing, would be a rental car, that I would have to pay for first then wait to have it credited back to me. I told him what ernest had initially told me and his response was, ""okay."". I could see it was going no where, so i told him to have ernest call me in the morning. So here I am with no car and no diagnosis after having the car there for 3 days. I would not recommend doing any business with the IPAC Mazda department. I cannot speak for the other IPAC dealers, but I'm certain I will not be purchasing a vehicle there ever again.

442,"November 11, 2012","First of all i would like to say that I received great customer services from most of the employees. My sales person was Austin Parker, he was very polite and knowledgeable  of the vehicles he presented me, he explained me all the features and details. I was referred to this dealership by someone who bought a car from Robert Reyes, they had excellent experience with him. Thats the reason I stopped by IPAC Mazda, i had the chance to talk to Robert Reyes 3 weeks before my actual purchase, he was super polite and very friendly, I instantly felt truly welcomed. Robert Reyes then assigned me Austin Parker as my sales person, because Robert Reyes is now a sales manager. 
Now, unfortunately Robert Reyes was not present on the day of my purchase (Nov. 10. 2012), i dealt with my sales person Austin Parker, which once again was super friendly and polite, Unfortunately when it was time to talk to the sales manager on duty (Eduardo Sanchez) I did not have a good experience at all, unbiased of the price offer he made me, he was very dry an unpleasant, made me feel that my business was not important for him, usually when you make an offer the sales manager takes it up higher for approval or disapproval, on my case he didn't even consider my offer, he immediately cut me off and asked me: ""I can't do it for this price, is there anything else i can do for you today?"". he did not even try to earn my business, thats was clearly an invitation to walk right out of the dealership, which i did right away.
Now the good news is, as i was backing up my car to leave the dealership, Austin Parker stopped me, he had talked to Tim Goodman who walked outside with him. I pulled back in the parking spot and walked back in the dealership to deal with Tim Goodman, which was a very friendly and polite person, he made me feel import and that my business mattered to him, he considered every offered I made, until we were able to strike a deal. 
I am very pleased with my overall experience with IPAC Mazda, i did not let my bad experience with Eduardo Sanchez ruin all the good work from all the other friendly employees.
In a nut shel, if you want great customer service, friendly staff and the best prices between  all the dealerships i visited (IPAC Mazda, Mazda South, North Park Mazda, Roger Beasly Mazda and Legend Mazda) stop by IPAC Mazda and give Austin Parker a chance to show you all the great things they have to offer, i strongly advise you to make sure his sales manager Robert Reyes is working on the day of your visit. If he is not i would suggest you to come back some other day that he is present, i would not want to deal with Eduardo Sanches, but hey you never know, you might have good luck with him!

Since my signature was required on some paperwork she said I should have Brandon show me around since we were also thinking of trading my Hummer in.  

Upon my arrival to the dealership i was greeted in the parking lot as i pulled in and directed where to park.  They also escorted me into the building and and had the receptionist page Brandon.  Everyone was very cordial and efficient.  

Brandon arrived and escorted me to Stephen Duff the Finance Manager's office.  Stephen too was very cordial and had all the paperwork ready for me to sign.  

After signing, Brandon showed me around the lot.  He walked me through a variety of makes and models that Mazda had to offer and was very knowledgeable about each accessory that the different models came with.  

Needless to say I was very impressed, relaxed and stress free.  I met Eddie Sanchez the Sales Manager who was very friendly and hoped that when I got ready to trade my Hummer would give them a call.  

Brandon and i set up an appointment to have my Hummer appraised and to start the paperwork for a trade in.  The entire process went very quickly and we soon came to an agreement on price.  I decided on a CX5 Grand Touring with Tech Package in Liquid Silver and as luck would have it my vehicle was on a truck headed to the dealership.  They took my 2006 Hummer off my hands and loaned me a CX5 to drive until mine arrived.  

My CX5 arrived the next day and Brandon walked me through the vehicle explaining how things worked.  He also helped me set up the Nav system, Bluetooth, Radio, and SiriusXM satellite which I got a 4 month free trial.  

Thanks IPAC MAZDA for making me feel like family.",5.0
445,"October 15, 2012","CUSTOMER SERVICE:  Manny the salesman was impeccable in customer service. This gentleman made it all about the customer by taking the time to ask questions that were important to the customer. He represented a new model of being a top salesman versus the traditional shark ways of push and rush! I was very impressed by Manny!Karl the finance manager is a great listener and this is rare in the automobile industry. Karl was interested in much more than closing a fast deal. He actually cared about establishing a long term customer relationship. It is obvious! There are multiple families that work with Karl and Manny because of their openness and high consideration of customers!
 
QUALITY OF WORK:  Manny went above and beyond in making sure he showed vehicles that I liked! Never did he once not know how to answer a Mazda question. To our family he is a MAZDA expert! His articulation and willingness to explain things honestly and to go step-by-step in how to operate features in a vehicle was a strong selling point for me! Karl alleviated my anxiety in making an iimportant major purchase and was helpful and did not hesistate in reexplaining anything. He accomodates the customer with a big great smile through the entire process which was contagious!
 
FRIENDLINESS: Both Karl and Manny are two of the most quickest, genuine, friendly auto industry individuals! It only tells one thing- THEY KNOW THEIR STUFF!
 
OVERALL EXPERIENCE:  My overall experience was the highest rate one can give! Karl and Manny are a team you can count on entirely! These two work together hand in hand and will deliver to you what you desire- from type of seats in your new car to a comfortable finance contract that fits you. They simply CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS! If you're looking for a vehicle, trust me, you will not be dissapointed!
 
PRICE: The price was fair. IN THE FUTURE IT'LL BE VERY HARD TO GO TO ANOTHER DEALERSHIP OR TO EVEN RECOMMEND SOMEONE TO ANOTHER DEALERSHIP! Sorry... as of now I don't like anyone else :)",5.0

447,"October 10, 2012","When I first started looking for a vehicle back in 2008, Karl Sidney was very sweet and patient while I hesitantly looked for a new vehicle. He showed me many vehicles that would meet my needs and worked with me on financing the one I finally chose. Since that time, I have referred my friends and family to Karl and he has gotten nothing but rave reviews on his service. On 10/4/12, I was again searching for a vehicle. Karl introduced me to Melvin and off we went in search of a car.  I selected a 2012 Mazda 3 with a sunroof, but was not gonna purchase until the 9th or 11th.  Well on the 9th, Karl was off, but being the professional that he is, he called Melvin and got the ""wheels"" rolling to quickly process my purchase. I arrived hungry, but was in and out within a short period of time and got to eat a good lunch.  Everyone was absolutely professional, and I NEVER felt pressured to buy anything I didn't want.  Thank you IPAC!!! Your positive attitudes, friendly and knowledgeable staff, and your consistency are all appreciated. Best wishes from a faithful IPAC customer. Y.S.",5.0

449,"October 07, 2012","Hi there my name is Edgar L. I was in need of a car and searching for weeks, my stress ended when I met Manny, who introduced me to Donald AKA Duck and last filed my paper work with Robert Reyes. I was extremely satisfied with Robert Reyes service, in fact because of his professional polite customer service I decided to stick whith IPAC Mazda only due to his excellent service. I was debating within two vehicles in a different dealer ship, but once I walked in and asked him what I can afford with a particular payment in mind he got me into a perfect used vehicle. Mr. Reyes didnt waste no time to figure out if I qualified or not an answered all my questions indeed in a timely manner. And believe me I asked every question possible which he answered and was not annoyed like other dealership management. To make this story short I was very pleased with everyone who helped me out especially Robert Reyes which I will recommend to others and will go back to purchase again from him. If you are looking for a new or used vehicle and great customer service I recommend to speak to Robert Reyes from mazda Ipac, his the man to talk to and he will make you the best deal out there. 

P.S 

I got me a Mazda3 black at a really reasonable payment and price thanks to Robert Reyes.",5.0
450,"October 07, 2012","My car buying experience was great thanks to Manny and the rest of the team who worked their butts off getting me into a new Mazda CX-5.  I couldn't be happier.  They worked on my loan for hours due to my not-so-great credit.  I never in a million years expected to go home with a brand new 2013 SUV that I am really, really happy with.  Thanks Manny and the rest of the team!!!",5.0
451,"October 04, 2012","Manny was the person we scheduled our appointment with in the first place, but we are so pleased that he was our salesman. He worked with us to get our daughter, who is a single mother, out of a dangerous clunker. He was patient and understanding the frustrations we had trying to figure out just what to do. I will definately recommend to anyone I know that is looking to buy a car to contact him. What a pleasant deal. Usually, we walk away from buying a new vehicle wondering if we did the right thing. With Manny, there was no question that we did. 

Congradulations to IPAC Mazda for have Manny as a exceptional salesman!

452,"October 04, 2012","I was greeted by Manny at time of arrival to the dealership and told me that 
Amy had a family emergency and was not able to assist me.  He presented to me and my
family the CX5 and looked at the 3 different styles.   After going over the numbers
(prices and trade-in value)without pressure I decided to buy the CX5.  Manny and the
rest of the staff treated my with respect and as a valued customer.  I have and will
recommend my friends and relatives to come buy a vehicle from your dealership.
Many thanks.

453,"September 27, 2012","Mr. Areizaga is a very kind and respectful salesman. Before I purchased my vehicle he answered all of my questions and was dedicated to getting me the car I wanted at a reasonable price. Not only was he willing to call  local dealerships to get the color I wanted for my purchase but he ensured I knew how to operate all of the technology  my car was equipped with before I left. I never felt pressured into making a decision. I am very thankful for him and his team and will always recommend him to my family and friends on their quest to purchase their next vehicle. 

Sincerely,
A very happy Mazda owner!",4.8
454,"September 27, 2012","We asked for an inernet quote from Ingram Park Mazda on a new 2012 Mazda 5 Touring with tint and bluetooth. Laura responded the same day with 3 quotes on 2012 new 5's and also with some alternate 2012 models and with a certified used 5.  We had done web comparisons on KBB and were pleased with the $. Manny met us, we went for a test drive, climbed all over the car and sat down to do the sale. The trade in was a fair price for our 2006 Ford Freestyle - about 800 to 1000 less than a car in almost perfect condition - so we were OK with the bottom line price.  Steve was creative and helpful with the financing, and even figured out an instant way to have our payment made electronically monthly from our brokerage account.  We did buy the extended coverage, and thought $1200 wa a fair price.  Manny suggested we buy road hazard coverage for the tires from a tire dealership - we would not have thought of this. Manny even helped me take my home-made roof rack off my Ford.  We were never uncomfortable - even though we have not bought a new car since 1998, and had never requested an internet quote because we thought we would be inundated with emailsWe were happy wih the whol experience - very polished crew.",5.0
455,"September 24, 2012",I drove to Ingram park from Austin in hopes of purchasing a SUV I found online. Although I was not happy that the car was being test driven and eventually sold at the exact same time I arrived (despite my notification to the sales associate 2 hrs before I made the trip); they managed to turn the experience around. Joel and his manager pulled all sorts of strings to get me very close to exactly what I was looking for within my budget. Everyone at the dealership was very friendly and I so far I am extremely happy with the car! ,4.4
456,"September 13, 2012","     I called the dealership early Saturday morning and spoke to Amy Erickson, a salesperson. She was really cool and set up an appointment for later that morning. I arrived at the dealership later than planned, but was quickly greeted by a sales person as soon as I got out of my old truck.  I told him I had an appointment with Amy.  He shook my hand and escorted me inside where Amy was paged.  Unfortunately Amy was already tied up with another customer. Which was understandable, I was late after all. She introduced me to another salesman Manny Khodayari, who was friendly, helpful and really knew his inventory!  I told him I was looking for one of those cool Mazda3's and he promptly took me to the lot where he proceeded to show one in every color available! I test drove one and was really happy with the cars performance. I wanted it!  Manny then walked me around the dealership to meet all the different people in the departments that I’d be dealing with, when I brought in the car for the various services they offer there. Everyone was really nice and friendly! It felt genuine.
     I then met with Sales Manager Robert Reyes. We crunched the numbers and arrived at a comfortable one.  I then walked over to Stephen Duff’s (finance manager) office where all the paperwork was explained to me and I was informed of all the freebies! (While I was told earlier that my 12 year old clunker trade in was only valued at five hundred bucks, Stephen informed me that it was now worth double that! I was pleasantly surprised to say the least!)  My favorites were the year of free wash tub service, the free Roadside service for me and anyone driving the car!  But most of all, I can't wait for my free IPAD! 
     I was in and out in about 3 hours. Not the usual 6 or 7 hour ordeal I’ve gone through in other dealerships.  It’s been about a week and I'm still riding high on those ""new car smell"" fumes. Overall, it was a great experience. I will recommend Manny and IPAC MAZDA to anyone looking for a great car buying experience.  Thank you Manny, Amy, Robert and Stephen for all you did for me.

462,"June 28, 2012","Overall, my experience was great.  The first day we went in was very late, approximately 8:30 pm.  Nobody approached up to help for about 15 minutes, although there were many standing around talking.  Brandon saw us and immediately came to help. We were approved, but had to negotiate to come to terms.  The car we bought wasn't ready yet since they had just gotten it in. The next day we went in we ended up working with Robert Martinez and the numbers came out perfect after some working on. The contract was signed contingent upon seeing the actual car completed. The third day we went in we dealt with Robert Reyes and Joel Kurtz. These are the guys that made everything happen.  The car still wasn't ready. We had serious issues with our insurance company handling things in a timely manner. Robert and Joel stayed later than they should have. Robert made a quick call to a different insurance company and we were set!  They gave us a loaner vehicle without question. I too am in sales and truly appreciated the way that Robert and Joel handled everything. Unfortunately, my initial salesperson and the second one knew I was coming in and left anyway. But, Robert and Joel picked up the slack and did a great job.  These two should or will be superstars.  Thanks, Guys!  They deserve anything that the company can do for them.  I will send referrals to these two.

Thanks,

463,"June 04, 2012","Worst customer service ever! They dont care if you have concerns with your car even a day after you have bought your car. I went back because the cheaply made vinyl around my window was missing some parts and I only had the car one week. All ray could say was you have to take it to the service department, I felt since not even having the car a complete week yet I would have better assistance in this matter but he obviously did not care so I asked to speak to his supervisor who I dont even know noq if it was his supervisor or not, but another guy who was suppose to be his supervisor ""Eddie"" which I think was just another sales guy and if not should really be fired comes out and tries to say they cant prove the damage was done before they gave me the car even though I had not driven the car and when I bought it, it was sitting in the very back of the lot who knows if someone walking by tried to steal it. He concludes by saying fine then the blame will be 50/50 since we both could not prove when the damage occurred so I stated since the blame would be 50/50 the cost to replace said vinyl should be 50/50 and this is where he rudely said ""have a good day ma'am"" and walked off.. He either was ashamed a woman made a valid point and argument or is truly the worst candidate to be in customer service. I will not let this go unresolved. His attitude and view on things were so out of reasoning, being a new customer who only had a car one week, they truly just dont care if you have issues all they care about it is you buying and once you leave its too bad so sad they repeatedly say ""Oh well you should have looked at the car before you drove off"" really??? SInce they dont already badger enough on buying the car as soon as you say you like it and as soon as you come to a agreement on a payment plan they rush you off to financing then hurry you into your new car so you dont have buyers remorse. Yes maybe I should have taken a magnifying glass and inspected every inch of the car but for them after one week to blow off any concerns you have and walk off is so rude and I will be contacting Mazda and BBB about this. Horrible service and I mean it was straight up unprofessional service how they handled this situation. And a pointer for Eddie, ""rays supervisor"" the next time a woman makes a valid point and makes you look like an idiot dont walk off with your tail between your legs because you know you were wrong, correct the situation since your profession is suppose to be great customer service.

464,"May 17, 2012","I wanted to purchase a new 30+k car and traveled 4hrs to get to this dealer because previously over the phone Manny Khodayari had promised he would give me the car if I sing the papers. Well, I did sign the papers and I gave him more than half the price on down payment. He promise to give me the car by a certain date or a rental so I won't be left without a car if the new one didn't arrive. The day came, and no rental and no car. Long story short, the dealer was NEVER going to have the car, they just got me to sign the contract under false pretenses. They NEVER bother to even say their sorry, didn't compensate or try to find another car, they just didn't care. Therefore they needed to return the money which Robert Reyes agreed. I got the check in the mail (one week after we agreed) for less the amount I gave them. Why didn't they just give me my original check? Why did they charged me money? This only tells me that they want to get anything from you regardless the lack of ethics they use. I would be careful and think twice before dealing with them. I DO NOT RECOMMEND BUYING ANYTHING HERE! Take your time and money elsewhere.

465,"December 13, 2011","Eddie Galang at IPAC Mazda sold me what he said was a ""Certified Pre Owned"" Vehicle,  not only did he vocalize that is was ""Certified Pre Owned"" , it also had the sticker across the top of the front windshield stating ""Certified Pre Owned"".  I just traded the vehicle in to another dealership who pulled the Car Fax on the vehicle and found that IPAC bought it at auction after being in an accident.  

I am very disappointed, and I ended up having to settle for $2,000 less then what I would have got on my car because it had been in an accident I didn't know about.  I will never buy another car from IPAC and will inform all others not to go to IPAC as well.  This is a true display of false advertisement.

The worst part about all of this was I had just got back from Iraq 6 months prior to that and was 5 months pregnant.  This shows me there is no moral code that you at IPAC Mazda hold.

Their sales and management team has changed somewhat. I called and talked to Gary Wiley. He was very professional and once I arrived, connected me to Josh Leal, (sharp young man) to help me look over new inventory and answer any questions I had. Once you get past the initial haggling points and stick to your guns about what you want and the terms you want, they get down to business. 
Their Director, Dennis and I came to an understanding and we proceeded with doing the purchase.
