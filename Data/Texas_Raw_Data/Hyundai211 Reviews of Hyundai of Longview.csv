0,"April 14, 2020","All I can say is I recieved EXCELLENT service from start to finish. I met salesman Mr. Reggie King through an online inquiry followed up by a phone call. Reggie answered all my questions truthfully concerning the condition of the exterior and interior of the used vehicle I was interested in and then texted pictures to me. I drove an 8 hour round trip trusting Reggie at his word not only about the condition of the car, but also the price and financial arrangements. With this being my 38th car purchase I'm very familiar with the antics you find at most dealerships which was not the case with Hyundai off Longview.  Reggie acted not only in sales but as liaison between me and Mr. Brandon Sledge, the finance mgr. Everything happened as stated by Reggie and Brandon. I was at the dealership almost two hours starting from the test drive, through the paperwork in finance, and leaving. Reggie and Brandon are an excellent team for Hyundai of Longview and I would definitely drive there again for another purchase. ",5.0
1,"January 25, 2020","Internet pricing with this dealership is a total SCAM.  You will NOT be able to get the car for the price advertised.  Emailed with a salesman for 2 days, confirmed everything about the deal - including that we had our own financing to which he said come on out and test drive and we can get the deal done.  Drove 2 hrs to test drive the car.  Car was great, but advertised at 37 miles, now has 1,200 - not a huge big deal, right?  Also advertised that it was black, black interior - obviously not, pics show gray - again, no big deal.  Test drove, loved it.  Upon test drive return, I tried to confirm the internet price of $15,963.  Was told he ""really didn't know the price"" but regardless, I would have to use their financing to get the internet price.  THAT was my first major clue, but I thought I'd try to make it work.  I gave them my pre-approved interest rates - said DO NOT run my credit unless you can beat that rate.  They ran my credit and then came out and told me there was an ERROR on the internet pricing and the car price was REALLY $19,999....due to their ""3rd party vendor"" mistake, it was listed wrong and they won't honor the price it's listed at, $15,963.  Tried to get me to finance through them at some astronomical rate and then just refinance with my bank in a few months...... WHAT THE ?#$%??????  How stupid do you think I am???  Even if I financed with them, they would not honor the internet price and yes, the price has been on the internet for weeks and is STILL on the internet as I'm typing this review.   Please do your self a huge favor and don't buy from this dealership.  I don't blame the sales people, they have to deal with what they are given - this falls directly to their finance and management.  Stay away!!!!",1.8

11,"August 28, 2018","This dealership stands by its slogan,""You pick it out, and we'll work it out"". Well, that is just what they did. I gave them a price i wanted to pay, 15 min later, i got the ok. Overall everything was good, my salesman Reggie King was not pushy and let me make the decisions. Not a 5 star because if people are giving someone your business, one needs to be appreciative of that. They only fill your tank if you buy a new car, not a pre-owned. So i got 2014 Hyandai Azera Limited, with an empty tank leaving the parking lot. I was lucky enough to make it to a gas station. Not happy about that at all. Management needs to consider doing this for ANY vehicle sold.",3.8

26,"February 16, 2018",I had been in an car accident and my 2009 Santa Fe (which I purchased new from Hyundai of Longview) was totaled.  I needed a new car and so got online and sent an email to Hyundai Of Longview.  I exchanged a few emails with Cedric Williams and told him what I was looking for.  When I arrived he greeted me and took me out to look at a car that he thought would fit the bill.  Cedric is a very nice and thoughtful person!  The car was just what I was looking for!  I mean he nailed it and I didn't have to even see any other cars!  Within an hour I had made the purchase!   This was a great experience and I am so looking forward to enjoying my 2016 Santa Fe!  ,5.0

30,"January 04, 2018","Review by Denise Norris-Dickson, James Dickson's wife: I found my car online at your dealership.  I visited several other websites, spoke with their salesman, and even went to physically view other vehicles.  However, Captain Jack was the standard all those cars were put up against.  We made an appt.and came to Longview when I was ready to deal.  Mack was our salesman.  He had a different Caribbean Blue vehicle for me to see.  However. I immediately informed him I wanted Captain Jack.  I did a test drive.  Got my Amazon card! Thank You! Mack listened, Mack was honest about what they could do financially.  However, I stood my ground on what I was willing to do.  And Hyundai came through again.  This is my 2nd Hyundai and Tucson.  I will never buy another brand.  I had a great experience with my first Tucson (Wiesner Hyundai in Conroe) and another one this time.  Thank you for making buying Captain Jack a great experience!",4.8

I told the salesman what car and payments it would take for me to buy a car.  He delivered in less than 10 minutes.

56,"September 29, 2017","The finance manager was not professional.  He tried to go 10,000.00 over what we agreed upon when making the deal.  I found this mistake when reading over the contract to sign.  They had to redo the contract based on my agreed price or I would have walked... He had the contract guy do the repricing on the contract therefore I signed.  Based on this, I do not believe I got the best rate of interest at the end.   I will not reuse this dealership.",1.6

75,"August 01, 2017","After visiting for other dealerships before going to Hyundai I was getting burned out in the car buying process. I had to particular items I needed in a vehicle and a price range I was shopping in. Every dealer I went to try to change my mind or sell me on something other than I wanted.

76,"July 28, 2017","I went to the dealership after doing quite a bit of online shopping, trying to find the right car.  I last purchased a new car in 2002.  It was a Toyota Highlander, which I loved.  I drove it for 216,000 miles.  I would have liked to buy another one, but, as a retiree on a fixed income, that was not something I could afford.  The Hyundai Tuscon was the closest I could find in something I could afford.  I love the car, and David Black at the dealership did an outstanding job.  I appreciate his help.  He was not pushy at all.  It was an enjoyable experience.",5.0

It seems like that would be so much easier for dealership employees as well as customers.",5.0

86,"July 17, 2017","When someone takes their car to a dealership they expect to have the problem solved.  That was not the case for me in Hyundai of Longview.  My car stopped running on December 26, 2016 and was towed to their location.  I picked it up the next day and they stated the problem was solved.  January 2, 2017 I drove from Austin to Jacksonville in order to pick up my daughters from the break. It broke down again and I had to bring it back to the same dealership since they did the job the first time.  They took 2.5 weeks to get my car ready and they claimed it was due to a part they had to order.  This summer, I went to have my car inspected and to my surprise, it did not pass because the computer  (that was repaired in January) vin # did not match the car vin #.  My local Hyundai contacted them and told them they needed to send the part for them to repair.  They insisted that I return the car to Longview and they would make the replacement. The computer vin# was from a car that never left their lot and the 2 wks I was waiting was not for a new part but for them to figure out what was going on.  Hyundai of Longview is dishonest and not worth your patronage, please consider Tyler or Shreveport. ",1.6

210,"March 11, 2013","I went to this dealership to view a used 2011 Hyundai Sonata that I had found on their web page.I live over an hour away from this dealership. When I arrived at the dealership the original salesman that I spoke with on the phone was helping another customer so David Black is the salesman that helped me. David was great, we test drove the car, he gave me all the spec's on the car and we sat down to talk numbers. During this time the orginal salesman that I spoke with, Kent, came over took over the sale.. We initally didn't agree on numbers, shook hands and I left the dealership. About a week later I called the dealership and spoke with David again with a counteroffer on the selected car and the dealership wouldn't budge so I agreed to their price and had them send a buyers order over to my credit union. I went to pick up the vehicle on Friday, March 8th and sat down with one of the dealers finance guys, Jake Pool, he seemed nice enough when we initally sat down but when he found out that my ex-husband's name was on the title it went down hill from their. My ex-husband is working overseas and did not sign the title or get a general POA drawn up before he left, big mistake. 

He asked me if I had a POA on my ex-husband and I stated no, he told that if I had a POA that would have worked but he was going to have to speak with the owners. He left came back and said that the owners agreed to go ahead and let me take the car but the title would have to be mailed overseas for my ex-husbands signature, during this time I was able to get my ex on the phone to speak with Jake. When it was explained to Jake that the turn around may take 3 weeks he went back and spoke with the owners again and they stated no, said that the car would have to stay at the dealership while this process took place. Realize during all this I had explained to both salesmen that I had just gotten a divorce and neither asked if his name was on the title.

The loan had been done, the dealer had drafting instructions, insurance had been changed to reflect the purchased vehicle. The finance guy Jake suggested to me keeping my vehicle and raising my loan to reflect the amount of my trade value. I told him that would raise my payment and that is not something I wanted to do. By this time I was very irritated, I had driven over an hour to pick up this vehicle that I had purchased, to be told I would have to wait 3 weeks before I could pick it up and by then would have made a payment on a vehicle I didn't even have.  I explained to Jake that this was rediculous, why couldn't I take the vehicle, they had drafting instructions to get their money, they would have my vehicle, why wouldn't I get the signed title back to them.  I said to cancel the deal to give me my keys back and I gave him his key, he turned around and walked off without another word. 

The salesman Kent, apologized drove the Sonata down to where my trade was and helped me get everything out of the new car and back into the old. He asked me if I could overnight the title to my ex and I told him fine I would see what I could do, Kent said he would park the car around back til everything was taken care of.  On Monday I texted the salesman, Kent and told him that my ex was going to the military legal dept. the next day to get a POA drawn up, he was going to scan and fax me this POA and send the original via DHL, Kent told me he would check with the finance guy and see if that would work and get back to me. He sent me a text back stating that the finace guy Jake required an original signature on the title. I sent Kent a text back stating that I feel Jake, the finance guy has issue with me due to what went down when I came in to sign and pick up the new car and feel he just wants to give me a hard time, Kent said that he would follow up with the GM. I don't think I even want this car from this dealership after all this....

I called directly to speak with ""Jake"" and have yet to hear back from him. During that time I have called several Hyundai Dealership that have stated a POA would be fine...

This has been nothing but a big mess with this dealership... I now have a loan that has to be cancelled, insurance has to be changed back over and a finance guy that wants to give me the hardest time he can on getting this business taken care of instead of focusing on getting a car sold. 

I hope I don't find out that I am the only person that has had this issue and that they have accepted POA's from other people who have gone to purchase from them. This will verify that Jake just wanted to give me a hard time and that is called discrimination.
