0,"September 07, 2016","I dealt with Curtis when purchasing a certified used vehicle online. Curtis was very professional, EXTREMELY knowledgeable about the vehicle, and understood what it took to make the deal. I must say, this is the BEST dealership I have ever dealt with! Rex Brewer in the service department is a super nice guy as well  and will go the extra mile to assist you with whatever you might need. ",5.0
1,"July 14, 2016","I just became of this website and I want everyone to know that salesperson J.P. Gwinn, Greg Lair sales staff,  is the go to guy if you need a car. The service department is outstanding and prompt. Thanks for restoring my faith in car dealerships. I'm the most skeptical person in the world and I'm not personal friends with any of these folks. Go to Greg Lair for a great deal!",5.0
2,"July 10, 2016","Jeff Brunson  did an excellent job helping me in the process of  purchasing my vehicle.  He was very informative and patient with me and did a great job explaining the vehicle I chose and he went to extra lengths to make my experience very pleasant.    I will always go back to Greg Lair for future purchases.
Thank you,

3,"May 28, 2016","Traded with Jeff and the staff for a new Sierra, the deal was fair and the staff was superb from the demonstration of the vehicle to the extra effort in securing the best rate of finance. This was my first purchase with the Greg Lair dealership but not my last, they have earned my business! Thanks I love my new truck.",5.0
4,"February 05, 2016","J.P. Gwinn was excellent to deal with and not the typical car salesman.  He was not pushy, answered all of our questions and helped us locate the right pickup to meet our needs.  His follow up and customer focus was outstanding.  We interfaced with several folks at Greg Lair (J.P,, Doug, and Ralph) and all were very friendly and professional.

Rex Brewer and the entire Service Department Team prepared and delivered our truck.  It's definitely a shop that we will use for future service.  Very knowledgeable employees!

Thanks,

5,"December 15, 2015","I was in the market for either a Buick Rendezvous or a Buick Rainier. I searched thru 6 different web sites and found a 2006 Rendezvous at Greg Lair Buick/GMC on a number of those sites. I did check on a couple of others as well. Two dealers never called back. From my first call to Greg Lair, the staff was courteous and helpful. I worked with Jeff Brunson on the phone and arranged to come down from Denver to look at the car. Jeff even picked me up at the airport. The car was clean, presented well, and drove like a Buick should. I've already passed his card on to a few friends of mine in Denver. The entire staff helped in making this a very pleasurable experience. ",5.0
6,"December 11, 2015",BOUGHT A NEW CAR YESTERDAY. BRAXTON GAINES WAS SUPER AND I DROVE AWAY IN A NEW CAR WITHIN A COUPLE OF HOURS SATISFIED.  WAS HELPFUL IN EVERY WAY AND WORKED HARD TO GET ME THE DEAL I WANTED,5.0

8,"August 04, 2015",This is the 2nd time I bought a car from Greg Lair. They will work with you and have you in the car you want with no hassle and stress. If you look at a car from there ask for Tracy Auldridge he is a great sales professional and is very honest. Not one of those guys to push a car on you just to make a quick buck. I highly recommend buying a car from Tracy and will be back next time I want a new car.,4.8
9,"February 27, 2015","We went to 3 other dealerships. We told them what we wanted, how much we could spend. They showed us what we didn't want, and the vehicle was more than we were willing to spend and continually called to convince us, what we didn't want, was what we wanted. 
We walked into Greg Lair, we met Curtis, A no Commission Sales Person. Very nice, welcoming and friendly! We told him what we wanted, how much we wanted to spend.We knew the price of the vehicle ""before"" they knew if we were trading. Up front pricing, amazing! Very respectful of the consumer. Greg Lair, raising the bar for honest, fair price and friendly shopping experience!! Keep up the great work!",5.0
10,"March 20, 2014","I went in to get for a general fluids and vehicle inspection.  Ended up with an alignment (which I expected), topped off fluids, and a stellar wash/vac/wipe down.  They provided a complimentary car and were very easy to work with.  I always was able to get ahold of Rex, my service guy, and he and the rest of the folks there were so friendly.  I typically cringe at the thought of taking my car in because I've had some very bad experiences, but I drove away without feeling like I just gave my right arm for shotty work.  I will continue to have service completed at Greg Lair and they will be my first look when purchasing a different vehicle.  They were head and shoulders above the local GMC competition in terms of service, friendliness, value, and timeliness.  ",4.6
11,"April 16, 2013","Rich from service dept offered to tow my vehicle to them since I have had many problems with this vehicle since day 1 and that he would ""take care of it"" . My van got towed and then he calls me telling me that I owe a 103.00 bill for towing I never requested or that they will hold my vehicle! Terry calls me which he stated is the service manager and wouldn't let me speak to Rich anymore (since that's who told me he'd take care of it) and was very rude and raised his voice at me telling me he would ""put inside shop to where I can't get it"" . I have never been treated so badly and think it's very bad business customer service to treat a customer like that especially when I paid cash for the vehicle. Now I'm about to have to go to Justice of Peace to get my vehicle back. ",1.0
12,"October 23, 2012","We saw this car online, and e-mailed asking aabout it, Jeff e-mailed us right back. He was very pleasant and willing to work with us any way he could. We live in Ulysses ,Ks. about 3 hrs from Amarillo,he was willing to see us any time that was best for us. When we went to look at the car it was still in transit, but we made the deal anyway, and he kept us informed about the delivery date about every other day. When we went to pick up the car he helped us with any question we had, and showed us everything that we should know about it. Jeff was really good to work with and when we need our next new car, he will be the first one we call.",5.0
13,"September 30, 2012",Doug was an extremely knowledgable and easy guy to work with.  He went the extra mile and found me exactly what I wanted.  Their 'forever' power train warranty is a huge plus for me on a used car.  I will definitely recommend Greg Lair Dealership and Doug Morrison to all my friends!,5.0
14,"September 02, 2012",I received great customer service at Greg Lair.  I was treated like an intelligent customer and they didn't try any of the usual car salesman tactics.  They took the time to explain everything to me and worked with me on the price of my car.,4.5
15,"July 12, 2012",This dealership has serviced my car on more than one occasion. I would rather have my car taken to a place that will do the work right and at a fair price than to a business that I have to take a chance on. Greg Lair's service department has been fantastic with their service and how they've treated me on every occasion. ,5.0

19,"April 25, 2012","I brought my 03 Grand Am in last month for the third time in 18 months.The same problem was wrong but this time it it was on a different cylinder.I told Sean I thought that the head was a bad casting.He told me there was'nt any way to really tell.I have a bad back and my wife is on disability.I told Sean that I really could'nt afford to pay to have it fixed.He had the service department fix it for free.I'd like to thank Sean,the service department and everyone at Greg Lair for helping my wife and I. ",5.0
20,"April 09, 2012","Sean is my ""go-to guy"" at Greg Lair Service Department.  He is always friendly, welcoming, and gives understandable explanations.  He really took care of the problem i had while driving down to Houston and a warning message came up.  I  phoned Sean and he explained the problem and told me where to find the closest service department to go to for a quick check.  As time was a problem, he found a Service Department in the Houston area close to my hotel. For me to.contact.  I really do appreciate being able to easily contact someone such as Sean who cares about the customer as he does.  Thank you, Sean. ",5.0
21,"March 31, 2012",From the moment we walked into Greg Lair dealership Jeff Sherrill greeted us with a smile and made us feel very welcomed.  He was patient and very understanding.   We would recommend this dealership to anyone that is looking for a new or used vehicle.  Thanks Jeff for all you did for us.  ,5.0
22,"March 30, 2012","I WENT TO GREG LAIR BECAUSE I KNEW THEY WOULDN'T TREAT ME DIFFERENT .... OTHER DEALERS I HAVE TAKEN MY BROTHER IN LAW WITH ME TO GET THE BEST DEAL.  JEFF (AS WELL AS THE OTHER STAFF) WAS WONDERFUL, IT WAS ALMOST AS IF HE COULD READ MY MIND.  THERE WAS A LOT OF TIME SPENT TO GET ME INTO THE TRUCK I ALREADY LOVE AND THE BEST FINANCING.  MY ONLY REGRET IS THAT I WAITED SO LONG TO MAKE THIS PURCHASE.  I WILL HAPPILY RECOMMEND JEFF SHERRILL AND GREG LAIR TO ALL OF MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY. IT IS DEFINITELY WORTH THE TRIP TO CANYON, TX.

25,"February 24, 2012","I had just begun looking for a new used car and seen a car of interest at Greg Lair.  I called the dealership and my call was transferred to Jeff (wish I remembered his last name). Jeff was friendly and very helpful.  There was no sense of pressure and provided me with the information I requested.  I mentioned a comparison car at another dealership out of town and Jeff made it clear he wanted to earn my business.  He provided me with an offer I couldn't refuse and gave me the price I was looking for on my trade in.  Again, there was no pressure and Jeff truly sounded like he was trying to get me the best deal possible.  I decided to finance my car through the dealership and was given a great interest rate.  The next day after test driving the car, I was told they found another bank willing to provide me with an even lower interest rate!  I was amazed at how well Jeff and the rest of the staff at Greg Lair worked with me to get me a great deal.  The sale was incredibly easy and it was more about making me happy than about pushing the sale through so they could move on to the next person.  Jeff was the most friendly and professional sales person I have ever come across.  I told him what car payment I was looking for and he made it happen.  I would like to thank Jeff and the rest of the staff at Greg Lair for making this a very pleasureable experience.  I would highly recommend visiting the dealership and giving them a chance to earn your business.  Thank you Jeff for all of your efforts and I love the car!  

Sincerly,

26,"February 11, 2012",Very friendly staff that made buying a car a pain free experience. We ere able to work together and come together with a final deal that made me very happy. I have recommended them to my friends and family.,5.0
27,"December 19, 2011","Had my truck only 3 months before it broke down. Took it in to get worked on and it was 2 days before I heard back from them. I had to call them to find out what was going on.I asked for a loaner car and they said they were out.Every time I called to see if they had one in yet I was told to call back later in the week to see if they had one. It was always the same line ""should have one in the morning"".Never happened.They had it 3 weeks and the only time I knew what was going on is when I called them to find out.When I picked up my truck it was almost completely out of gas. The low fuel light was on so I know they saw it. They did fix my truck but also scratched the front right quarter panel when doing it.Will not go back even to get my free oil changes.",1.5
28,"April 10, 2011","Overall the experience I had at Greg lair was excellent. I found a 2007 GMC Sierra with low mileage and in excellent condition overall. The thing that surprised me most was the price as compared to other similar vehicles at other dealerships. It was considerably lower than the others, making Greg lair our top option without a doubt. Every individual I dealt with helped out tremendously. Our salesman was Marcus Briscoe. He was exceptional in helping us out and making the sale. Once the deal was done he explained all the features of the vehicle to me thoroughly not missing out on anything. I would recommend all that are interested in a new vehicle to this dealership!",5.0
29,"March 09, 2011","I went to Greg Lair just to look. I had no intention of buying on that particular day. Once I was greeted by the staff and saw what they had to offer I knew I had come to the right place. I felt no pressure, the staff was extremly friendly and courteous and they gave me the best proce. I went to several other dealerships that day but in the end I came back to Greg Lair. I felt very comfortable purchasing a new vehicle there.",5.0
30,"January 18, 2011","Tom was very knowledgeagle of his products and prices.  First contact was internet, next telephone then in person.  The deal never changed.  Tom also provided a very helpful ""delivery"".

Tour of the shop was enjoyable including meeting shop foreman Scott and visiting with long time friend, technician Karl Smith.",4.8
31,"January 13, 2011","We had purchased a used trailblazer from the dealership, and so far everything had been pretty much like any normal vehicle.  Well a cold front came through and the vehicle started sounding like it no longer had a muffler on it.  I took it to a local muffler shop and was informed that we had a broken exhaust manifold.  We were quoted about $1500, but they would not be able to perform the work and purchase the part.  My husband called the dealership where we bought the part (Greg Lair) and the parts manager asked a few questions.  He then told us the part was under warranty.  We have 75,000 miles on our trailblazer and the emission warranty is good for 80,000 miles.  The best part was that they could get a manifold in that day and have it installed before the end of the day.  It took about 4 hours to have the work done, and the mechanic (Jerry) noticed that we needed an air filter as well.  I am really grateful that the Greg Lair team was able to quickly, efficiently and expertly handle this. I will definately take my vehicle back to their shop for future repairs, outside of the free oil changes.
