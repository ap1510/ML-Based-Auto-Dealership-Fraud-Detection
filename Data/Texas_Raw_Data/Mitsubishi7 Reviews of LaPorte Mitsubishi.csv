5,"July 01, 2017",I spoke to the owner Gabby who guaranteed me that if i came down with my documentation and the advertsied $29 down payment as shown on tv that id drive off the lot. That they didnt care about bad credit bankruptcy or divorce that id still get a car. After i told her my credit was bad i made an appointment and wenr down there druving for an hour from 1960 and 45 only to get there and he (Harry) tell me she misrepresented herself and that i needed a large down payment or a cosigner and didnt qualify because of my credit. ,1.0
