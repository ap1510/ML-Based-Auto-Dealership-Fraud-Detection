1,"August 11, 2012","I drove out to this dealership 120 miles after discussing a deal with the internet sales manager. When I got there the car was perfect and the people that worked at the dealership were friendly and a pleasure to work with on the car deal (as well as just to chat with.) Which was a little bit of a surprise, because I have always gone to the mattresses when car buying. The really big surprise came at the time to sign documents on the purchase. I have some issues on my credit that would give a dealer good reason to give me an exorbitant interest rate (in my opinion--and I let them know this up front. So I was a lamb just waiting for the slaughter, so to speak,) but these folks had the integrity to give me an honest deal--and by honest I mean I was not just pleasantly surprised, but shocked at how great a deal they gave me. The transparency was refreshing. I have bought cars from a different dealer in Dallas 8 times in the last 15 years BUT I will go to Sandlin for every purchase I decide to make down the road--as well as suggest them to my friends and family and anyone on the internet that will read my reviews. This is a dealership with a home-town feel to it, and these folks are going to give you a deal that you will be happy with--and one that you will be able to see them around town and shake their hands when you see them in the future--Even if you are not from around here and may never see them again like me--theyll give you a great deal.) If you purchase a car I guarantee that Sandlin will keep your business in the future. There were no gimmicks. No high pressure. Just great prices, great people and above all--Solid integrity. I can't express enough how happy I was that I made the long drive out to Mt. Pleasant. I know when I read gushing reviews about places, I think to myself that the person must somehow be affiliated with the company. I assure you, I am in no way affiliated with this company and to prove it you can feel free to ask me questions. If you feel like making a drive to Mt. Pleasant--do it. If you don't feel like it--you'll lose out on a great experience. ",5.0
