0,"February 10, 2020","I  purchased new Mazda 6 Gran Touring-oil changes are with Quick-lane where they made a large door ding while car was in for oil change- quick-lane manager did not wish to tend to my complaint and said it was no big deal. I complained with Sames ford since they refer purchasers and leases there and although they did reluctantly make the repair after I complained to the manager of maintainence, I later found that my jack was stolen and I priced it at another dealer for about $200.00. That was 3 yrs ago and I had sworn to myself that I would never again purchase or do any business with this dealer or quicklane. This dealer always sends coupons, for maintenance or retail but I prefer to avoid hassles with with this dealer and go to an outside shop or out of town dealer. I do love Mazda and when I take my Mazda to the valley or San Antonio, they are very professional and courteous. I’m sorry that I can’t  say many nice things about this dealer.",2.0
1,"April 01, 2019","We have a $60,000 diesel F350 Turbo with just over 100,000 miles with a blown engine!  A diesel should last 500,000 miles or more! 
 Ford will pay $4000. Of a $22,000 repair. We still owe $35,000 on it! 
  We have had problems with this truck since 2 weeks after we bought it.  Owned it just over 2 years. Been in the shop 6 times.  
 SAMES auto group in Laredo Texas is the biggest ripoff. 
 So after 7 Ford Trucks in a row... never again. 
  Ford does not stand behind their product!!!!

2,"December 25, 2018","Customer service and repair are a ripoff! I do not recommend them at all! Don’t go there, they take advantage of your insurance. They lie and take forever to repair.",1.0
3,"December 13, 2018","They are selling ford focus, knowing that it will cause major problems in the future without telling you. I understand that cars may have problems but its up to the customer to decide whether or not to buy a car knowing that in future it will have transmission problems. They haven’t fix mine amd has been in the workshop alot of times.",1.0

25,"October 26, 2017","My experience with the Sames Dealership was nothing but the very best! From the minute I walked in to view the different vehicles they had in stock, to the moment I drove out my new truck, the attention of the sales person, as well as the management team, was exceptional!!

27,"October 19, 2017",The fact that you can charge your iPhone while waiting is really cool. It would be nice to provide a flyer or a card that states the maintenance schedule for your vehicle. It’s quite surprising when I take my truck for an oil change and get told that other services are needed but are incredibly expensive at that moment. If I could set money aside I would be more willing to have full service as maintanence schedule states.,5.0

67,"August 22, 2017","
Both when I called and visited, the service reps insisted that I had to schedule a AC Warranty Diagnostic a week away.  ""Too many customers ahead of you.""

This meant that I had keep driving around drenched in a hot, certified pre-owned 2014 Ford Expedition that we bought last Dec for $34,000 -- with TWO warranties.

Fortunately, Crystal answered my second, desperate call: ""leave it now, and we'll fix if it's minor without waiting for your scheduled Diagnostic.""  

So my wife did that, and was shuttled to her office at 1 pm, then back from there at 5.  

Mr. Montante replaced the AC blower motor under warranty in only 4 hours.

Crystal and Mr. Montante need to tell the first service reps how it's done.  Great job!
