0,"May 21, 2019","Took my Expedition in for an oil change, tire rotation, and to address an open recall. I was greeted at the door by Robert Espino who was extremely helpful. I had planned to leave my vehicle there and Uber to work, but asked if they had loaners available. Because I have PremiumCare I was sitting in a loaner Escape in 10 minutes and was on my way. Robert called me later that morning to let me know my vehicle was ready. When I arrived back at the dealership, my vehicle had been washed and vacuumed and the bill was $10 less than I am used to paying at the Ford dealership closer to my house!

All in all a fabulous experience. I will definitely be returning to Park Cities Ford for all of my future work. Robert was responsive and helpful and the work was done quickly and affordably. ",5.0
1,"May 02, 2019","GO ANYWHERE ELSE! No deal is worth being mistreated, misled, nor having your time wasted. From the start, while test driving I was not allowed to go on a highway. When it came to negotiating, they came back with something written in marker for THOUSANDS MORE than the asking price. After asking to see all the fees and taxes, they came back with another paper written in marker that showed four numbers: ""car, fees, tax, total."" They said they DO NOT NEGOTIATE and that was the absolute best they could do. I didn't walk out, I ran! They were SHADY every step, and could not even show me the $1000+ dealer fees they were trying to add-on in addition to tax, title, and license. RUN! RUN! RUN!",1.0

4,"July 28, 2018","Fantastic experience.  I’ve bought many vehicles in my 55 years.  This was a top notch experience. I mistakenly thought the dealership opened at 7:00 AM but it turns out that was just the service department.  I strolled through the lot and Joe came out and offered to help even though the sales department wasn’t open yet.  I knew the truck I was looking for based on the website. It was an enjoyable, total hassle free experience.  They assessed my trade quickly and offered more than I was expecting. We closed the deal quickly and it restored my faith in the car dealership experience.  And Pierre provided the best overview of the vehicle’s options/capabilities I’ve ever received. These guys know what they’re doing. ",5.0

6,"March 19, 2018","Bought a truck from Joe D'Angelo at Park Cities Ford. I've bought a lot of cars in my 50 years, but Joe is the best guy I've ever dealt with when buying a car.  We felt like we left the dealership with not only a truck, but a friend. I cannot recommend Joe at Park Cities Ford any more highly.  The overall dealership experience was great.  If you need a car or truck, call Park Cities Ford and ask for Joe.  No pressure, no nonsense, and just a great guy.",5.0
7,"November 11, 2017","Salesman, Joe D'angelo was very knowledgeable and great to work with. He worked hard to secure the financing and get the vehicle prepped for delivery. If you are looking for a new vehicle I recommend you contact Joe to assist you with the process
Also, Robin York, finance manager takes the time to go over your contract and other necessary paperwork, making sure you understand everything before you sign.
My next vehicle purchase will come from Park Cities Ford

9,"February 01, 2017","We left one dealership after having a horrible experience. I was told over the phone that the vehicle I wanted was ready and to come in and compete the sale. After driving 1.5 hours, I was told the car sold two days earlier and no one bothered to call me. We ended up going to Park Cities in Dallas and worked with Reid Landers and had the best car buying experience ever! Down to earth, easy to talk to and deal with. A true no hassle experience that was enjoyable. Thanks Reid! Everyone there from sales, finance, and service was a pleasure to work with! I love my new Lincoln MKX! Susan Wigley",5.0
10,"January 19, 2017","Second time to have a terrible service experience at this dealership. 

Took my lifted truck in to have them diagnose a noise. They immediately said it's not going to be covered if it's a suspension noise due to the lift kit. No problem. I get it. That doesn't mean I don't want it diagnosed and fixed though. 


I made an appointment 3 days in advance. I arrived an hour earlier than my appointment time, which would give them more time to get it figured out. The truck sat all day and never made it in the shop. Still not sure why I made a 10:30 appointment and it still didn't get seen in the same day. At the end of the day I called for an update and was told they would have it in the shop first thing in the morning. At 11:30 the next day I called to check the status. I was told that they have driven it and are trying to determine the noise, but that it was 90 percent chance that it's NOT the suspension. Fast forward to the end of the day. I called again for an update. I had to leave a message. He called back and told me they are 90 percent sure it is the suspension and to come get it. A Ford dealer couldn't tell me what the problem was...just come get it and take it the place that lifted it. 

Ok fine, I get it, you don't want to cover it in terms of warranty. No problem, but a professional place like this should at the very least, be able to tell you what is wrong. Nope. 

Next morning I say I'm coming to get it. I get inside and they have left their paperwork on the floor and also the seat cover and floor mat on the passenger seat. 

I drive up front to find the GM. No luck. I left a message for the Fixed Operations director and he called me a few hours earlier. I explained everything and he said he wanted to dig deeper and would get back to me. Well, that was a week ago and I've not ever heard another word. 

I called 4Wheel Parts in Plano and explain it all to them. They responded, ""No problem. Bring it in, we will fix it.""  

They had it a total of 2 hours and called me to tell me the truck was done. It had a bad shock, they replaced it. 

I can eat some crow and accept the fact that this turns out to not be a Ford problem. What I can't accept is how poorly I was treated by Zach in service, how I never got a return follow up from their Fixed Operations Manager and the fact that they had my truck for 2.5 days and couldn't tell me it had a blown shock. 

Avoid Park Cities Ford...there are plenty of Ford Dealers around, I suggest you find another one.",1.0
11,"October 03, 2016","Broke down on Saturday in Dallas. My 2015 Explorer would not start and we were in town from Cleburne to watch our grandson play baseball. Roadside came and jump started the car. A friend had recommended I go to Park Cities Ford Since we are not familiar with dealers in Dallas. We arrived at Park Cities Ford Service department and they welcomed us and apologized for the trouble we were having. After just a short wait we were back on the road to catch another grandsons game in Haltom City. Thank you park Cites you saved the day. Visiting owner from Cleburne,

12,"September 06, 2016","Worst Car Buying Experience ever and very dishonest Salesman and Manager.  We worked out a deal over the Internet for a 2017 Ford Fusion SE with a 39 month lease payment of $265.  We were trading in another Car which was leased and had $2500 negative Equity.   We went to this Dealership planning to sign the Lease Papers. They left us sitting and sitting and sitting around 3 hours.  Finally the Salesman comes over with his Manager and says the Payment is now $440.  Now mind you we have $2500 negative Equity, we have 715 Credit Scores and they were advertising Lease Payments on these Cars less than $200 for a 39 month Lease. When we asked the Salesman what happened he said his Manager didn't know anything was being traded in and had it figured wrong.  BS...BS...BS  we left and went to another Ford Dealership who worked the Deal for the 2017 Ford Fusion SE by trading in our Car and used $2700 negative Equity and the Final Payment was $299 for a 39 month Lease. We only paid $299 out of pocket first payment.  Now this Dealership is very questionable and extremely shady place to do business.",1.0
13,"June 03, 2016"," After being one week out of warranty but way under 36000 miles they found three things, radio, battery and washer reservoir broken, and would not even call ford to see if they would cover.

14,"January 06, 2016","Worst place of business I have ever dealt with in my life. We drove 3 hours after being assured the vehicle we wanted was ours and in ""make ready"". Signed papers with the bank before we ever left town and drove to Dallas. Papers were sent to the dealership. When we were 30 minutes out the salesman Chris Hoffman called us and informed us that his sales manager had ""sold the vehicle out from under us"" even thought they had the bank draft in hand and knew we were in route. He also said that he was so mad about it that he quit. We immediately called and asked for the sales manager who informed us ""that they sell to who is there and do not hold cars"". We continued onto the dealership hoping to work something out and they would not honor the sale even though the car was still there and the deal was not complete with the other buyers and we had texts and email proof of the negotiations etc. It was the most unprofessional & unethical experience I have ever had. I would never do business here. I hope the owner of this dealership realizes how his business is being ran and his customers are being treated. This is not how you treat people",1.0
15,"October 11, 2015","I want to give anyone in search of a new car some information that I wish I had privy to when I began my car-buying journey. Do yourself a favor and memorize this name: Alonzo Gallaread! He is the greatest! After several weeks of searching, visiting, and calling so many other dealerships, I went into Park Cities and thankfully had the pleasure of working with Alonzo. He was so attentive, and personable. All while being knowledgeable and very professional. And above all, never once being overly pushy! I despise that tactic...it feels like intimidation. But i was getting exactly that at the other dealerships I'd visited. Alonzo gained my trust by being REAL. And he got the deal done. I left with the vehicle i love, at the price i wanted, that day. Extremely satisfied! 
If you're similar to me, and want to save some time as well as avoid the stress of finding the right vehicle,  you now know where to go and also who to ask for. ",5.0
16,"August 26, 2015","I am not one to give unnecessary compliments but Jordan couch at Park cities is due for the excellent way he worked to meet my families auto-needs. The friendly staff at ""Park-Cities Ford"" made my fiance & I feel welcome even with a screaming child. There was ""NO BACK & FORTH"" and we received a price, rate, and payment that fit our scope. Also, we received more options & better financial structuring than expected through the efforts of the finance manager we worked with. I wish I remembered his name so I could pass deserved thanks for his considerable efforts. 

Park Cities Ford members took the time to listen, examine, and address our questions & made us feel like family during our visit to the dealership. I highly recommend Jordan Couch & his expertise, knowledge, and concern for quality service for your needs.

20,"July 20, 2015","Tony Mazhar of Park Cities Lincoln was an excellent sales contact who worked with me on a new vehicle lease.  He was willing to search out the vehicle finish and options we were looking for within the network, assisted with various pricing options, and followed up at appropriate intervals to check in but while being very mindful of my time as we worked through things on our side.  In the end, he was able to drive the new vehicle to our site and exchange it out for the lease vehicle being turned in so I never actually had to visit the dealership.  All paper work was completed here on site and we now have our new vehicle to be enjoyed by the team.  ",5.0
21,"July 10, 2015","The dealer's salesman gave us a phone quote (after getting the price from his sales manager) on a used truck that had not yet been put on the lot. The salesman claimed he had emailed information that never arrived - when I asked him to resend it, he had neither my email address nor the email he supposedly had sent. We saw the truck as soon as it went on the lot and reconfirmed the quoted price. The salesman gave us overstated certified vehicle warranty information on material points that didn't match Ford's own website which I had previously researched. I asked to speak to someone about this information and spoke to the dealer's very knowledgeable and helpful Finance Manager the next day (a bright spot in our dealership contacts)  - he confirmed that my warranty understanding was correct. That night we went to buy the truck. Neither the original salesman nor the sales manager were there, and a different team gave us a price $2,900 more than we had been quoted. I asked to have the original salesman and/or sales manager call me to honor our quote - this original team then told me that we had misunderstood the original quote, the price went up after the truck had been certified (it had a certified plate the night we saw it, which was when we discussed the certified warranty benefits and reconfirmed our original quote), etc. 
Today I spoke with the general manager about the misinformation and the dealership's failure to honor the quoted price and learned the car was sold the day before yesterday  . . . a fact not mentioned when we were at the dealership to buy the truck for the quoted price the day before yesterday or during my three calls yesterday to the dealership. Bad information and quotes that aren't honored - this is not how I expect to do business.",1.0
22,"June 11, 2015","I went here to look at a 2013 Fusion Titanium used.

He then said, based upon the 'great deal' they were offering, they would not discount or fix.

24,"May 04, 2015","I've bought over 20 autos in my life, and Jordan Couch at Park Cities Ford is the best salesperson that I've ever had the pleasure of buying from, period.  He went above and beyond to make our car buying experience enjoyable, comfortable, informative, transparent and simple.  He emailed a low no haggle internet price right from the start that I was able to confidently use to test 3 Ford competitors and nobody wanted to beat his price.  Jordan sold for Audi and BMW before recently joining PC Ford, he is a cut above the rest, he sales with humbleness and integrity, no pressure and no tricks.

All service done there, and car has exemplary records.  The offer was so insulting we got up and left.   The sales manager said it was because of a ""poor"" car fax......

The car fax instead said that ""this vehicle is worth more than average, based on the information in this report"".   I understand that everyone needs to make a profit, but offering 20 cents on the dollar is a little much.

He always goes above and beyond to make sure he understands exactly what I'm in the market for and how much I'm willing to spend.  He makes purchasing or leasing a vehicle as smooth as possible every single time.

33,"January 21, 2014","I was in search of a new Ford F-150.  I was contacted by David Jaffe that he had the exact F-150 I was looking for.  However, when I got to the dealership, the F-150 was not there (LIE #1).  David Jaffe said it was ""company policy"" that he could not get the F-150 to Park Cities Ford without a signed contract (LIE #2).  

Well, it was the exact F-150 I wanted, so I went ahead with the buying process.  After settling on a price, David Jaffe came back to me with a piece of paper with the F-150 pricing numbers on it.  The price had gone up $10,000!!!  I thought it was an honest mistake and told David that he must have grabbed the wrong paper.  He said that he didn't (LIE #3).  I had to argue with David and finally show him an email FROM Himself to me with the quoted price!!! After seeing the email, he admitted to his mistake.  

Then we get to financing...David tells me a monthly payment.  I ask him what the interest rate is.  He says, ""It is actually illegal for me to know your interest rate.  I can not tell you that."" (LIE #4!!!).  What in the world?! David treated me like an idiot the entire time!  Couldn't stand it....

BUT THE STORY GETS WORSE!!!

So, after negotiating the financing costs (And David actually telling me what the interest rate was, even though he had earlier told me it was ""illegal to tell me""), I closed on the truck.  Signed every line, crossed all the T's, dotted all of the I's.  Part of the deal was me giving them my current car as a trade in.  The F-150 wasn't going to arrive for a week, when I would pick it up.

Two days after I signed for the truck and traded in my car, I get a call from David....THE TRUCK WAS NO LONGER AVAILABLE!!! What in the world?!  David had already drugged me through the mud, and now the truck I signed for was not available?! PLUS, they have my trade in vehicle!! 

David then tells me that he can get another F-150, exactly the same, but with a slightly different interior.  He asks if this is OK.  I quiz David several times to ensure that everything else is exactly the same.  He says it is.  So I agree on the phone for this new F-150, which will also take a week to deliver.

AND GUESS WHAT?!

When the second F-150 arrives....IT'S DIFFERENT!!! (LIE #5).  At his rate...I'm pissed (obviously).  I then had to go through hell to get my traded in vehicle back.  Park Cities Ford had already sold my trade in (even though I still held the Title to the car) and were offering me a terrible price for the car.  I actually found my car at a near by dealership for $3000 more than what Park Cities Ford was offering me for my car.  After several phone calls...Park Cities ended up purchasing my trade in car back and returning it to me.

Long story short....DO NOT SHOP AT PARK CITIES FORD!",1.0
34,"October 28, 2013","DO NOT GO TO PARK CITIES FOR SERVICE OR BODY WORK!!! I have been to Park Cities Service 3 times for the same repair work. They basically have made me diagnosis the problems... I am not a mechanic. I am a female and I know absolutely nothing about cars, but evidently I know more than there mechanics do. And as I said I have been 3 times and am still having the same problem. So far they have screwed my insurance company out of $4700 and haven't done a thing about the problem. 

The paint and body department is just as bad if not worse. My car was in the shop for 2 1/2 months for repair work that should have been completed in less than 30 days. They told me that it would be done. I called and they said it would be done the next Monday. I called that Monday and they said it would be done Wednesday. I called Wednesday and they said it would be done Friday. This went on and on for 2 MONTHS!! Part of the reason for the wait was because they sold my doors to make themselves $$$ on them not realizing they would need some parts off of the doors. When I got the car back my door panels were cloth instead of leather. My entire car is leather and the Manufacturer was called by me and they said that based on the vin and model of the car if Park Cities had ordered the correct panels they would have been leather. But per Brad the body shop manager my car shouldn't be leather. Basically he didn't want to admit they screwed up yet again. Long story short I had to take my car back AGAIN to have the correct door panels put in. 

Basically, I am still having the same mechanical issues after 3 times of having it fixed. With all 3 times taking wayyyyy more time than it should have. And the body shop is horrible. Avoid Park Cities Ford service and body shop. They are horrible and will take everything they can from you and your insurance.

Before scheduled appointment salesman  emailed me to let me know that Finance Director whom brokered my deal had all the paperwork in his office and had left for the day. Thus, he would get all my ppwk in the morning for me to come in and close deal. Great, right?

38,"February 27, 2013","After taking my Lincoln MKX (2011) in for a problem covered under my new car warranty, I had to reach the conclusion that either they are incompetent or they just don't care. My power steering started making a whining noise with they supposedly fixed after being in the shop for a week. Whatever they did caused all kinds of other problems within 4 or 5 days afterwards. Including a completed loss of power steering, the inside of the car filling with smoke while I was on the freeway,and them keeping it for another 3 weeks trying to figure out what to do. I finally got my car back after being told it was fixed only to discover the noise from the original complaint was not fixed. To make a long story short, after botched maintenance
 and poor communications, I traded the vehicle on a new NON- Ford vehicle and will now stay as far away from a Ford product and this dealership as possible. Oh did I mention that the car had barely 20,000 miles on it as this was taking place and is suppose to be their premium product. ",2.2

The dealership used what I call a bait car... a 2000 Lincoln Town Car with about 14,000 miles on it to get people into the dealership.  Within three business hours I had the funds to buy the car, and was told that it was sold already.  Within minutes I looked on craigslist for another Town Car and found one on another website from a supposed different car lot that had the exact mileage and VIN # of the car that I wanted at the Park Cities Lincoln dealership.  I called this other dealer and they also said that it was sold already.  Not only am I sad that I didn't get this car.. I am very sad that this dealer uses these kinds of unethical sales practices on people.  I expect that from a non-Lincoln dealership...  just not a Lincoln dealership.

42,"October 26, 2012","I leased a 2011 F150 from this dealership.

Within 100 miles of driving away from the dealership the bluetooth stopped working with the iPhone 4 I had.  Took the vehicle into service and the service department informed me that Ford only supports IPhone 2.0 - whatever that is.  I was told I could remove and re-insert the fuse for the electronics to reboot the system to clear hangs.  

At that point I should have just left the truck on the lot, but I didn't.  Stoopid me.

I have been all the way up the food chain to the VP of customer relations in North America, and Fords response has been pretty much to tell me to &quot;f* off&quot;.

And the best bit is that Ford will only let you or the dealer you leased from buy the vehicle. You can trade it on to another ford dealer -- presumably for another Ford vehicle only.

Nice lock in.  I was dumb and didn't do enough research. They saw me coming and fleeced me and now are probably having a good laugh at the chump.

Beware, as &quot;caveat emptor&quot; certainly applies to both this stealership and Ford.

43,"July 03, 2012","I purchased a new Taurus and Ranger.  At 3,360 miles the right front wheel fell off the Ranger.  I had it towed to a repair shop that was near the Ford Dealer in Mabank, TX.  The tow truck driver and repair mechanic said there was something wrong with the wheel and would not touch it until the Insurance Adjuster saw it.  I called Mr Lower, who after talking to his manager suggested that it be taken to the dealer and to call the Ford Customer Relationship Center.  I spoke to ""Brittney"" she said to take it up with my insurance company, ""that is why I have insurance.""  I was told in no uncertain terms that Ford would have nothing to do with the wheel failure/factory defect.  I stated that a Ford Dealer was just down the street, but she said that Ford is not interested,.  I told her I was shocked that they would not like to inspect the vehicle since it was located so close to a dealer.  I was rejected. She said that Park Cities was responsible for inspecting the vehicle prior to me purchasing it.  

I then received a letter from Steve Bardell, Legal Assistant, OGC Product Claims, Ford Product Claims.  He stated that Ford was unable to assist me because they did not have the opportunity to inspect the vehicle nor inspect the defective parts.  I sent a return letter informing him of ""Brittney's"" refusal and that the defective parts are still at the repair shop waiting his or Ford's inspection. No reply.  

My wife and I was treated very nicely at Park Cities.  They bent over backwards to make sure that my wife was satisfied with her new toy.  The prices for both vehicles were better than at any other dealership especially the ones close to home.  I had to travel 60 some miles to Park Cities Ford but saved a great deal of money. 

My heartburn is the manner that Park Cities and Ford treated me after the wheel failure.  I have purchased 20 some Fords in my life time starting with a 1951 2 door and ending with a 2012 Taurus and 2011 Ranger.     ",3.3
44,"April 12, 2012",Salesman was very pushy about wanting to run a credit report before discussing pricing of the car.  When all we wanted to know how much the car of my dreams bottom line would be.  After several hours of hassling around the saleman told us the dealership did not want to do business with us since they did not think we were being honest.  How can they state not being honest when all we said from the beginning was we were looking at pricing only.  Like I said they had the car of my dreams which I did buy but from a very honest and friendly dealership.  Called dealership spoke with supervisor who wanted to make it right.  You make it right by having qualified and honest salesmen.,2.3
45,"June 13, 2011","I have been coming to this dealership for service needs for my 2003 Lincoln Navigator the past 3 years without many complaints but had an experience recently that just rubbed me the wrong way.  I called and spoke with Hector on Thursday 6/9/11 and scheduled a service appointment to bring my car in the next morning before 8:00 am.  I let him know when I scheduled the appointment that I needed new front brake pads as well as a diagnosis for a check engine light that had just recently come on.  

I showed up the next morning with the car and met with Hector.  Their computers were down so he had to take all my information again and work up an order (inconvenient, but not a big deal overall).  He quoted me the price for the brake job as well as diagnostic fee for check engine light which was in line with my expectations.  I left the car with him and then had my wife take me to work.  

I worked through the day and around noon was surprised that I hadn't heard back from the service department yet with a diagnosis or recommendation for what to do about the check engine light.  I finally called the dealership at 3:00 pm to check on the status.  I waited on hold for 5 minutes (again, not a big deal, but surprising for a dealership) and finally got a hold of the operator and asked to speak to Hector.  She said he was on the phone so I asked if she had the ability to look up the status of my vehicle.  

She did, and pulled it up on the computer and said &quot;It hasn't been looked at yet...&quot;  I was frustrated and asked if they &quot;had planned on looking at it today?&quot; and she didn't really have an answer (not her fault by any means) so she put me through to Hector who was now off the phone.  He told me the same thing that it &quot;hadn't been looked at yet, but they could probably look at this afternoon or in the morning.&quot;  He did apologize and then went on to say that he could offer me a free rental car which was a nice gesture, but I told him that I made a point to bring in the car before 8:00 am to get looked at and 7 hours was plenty of time to at least get a diagnosis.  

Don't get me wrong, I don't blame Hector personally for the car not getting looked at because I don't know if that was in his control, but even a phone call from anyone that day letting me know they were behind or setting the time frame expectation on the front end would have done the trick.  I'll be pretty hard pressed to take my vehicle back to the dealership for service.   ",2.8

47,"October 27, 2009","Buying my new car at Park Cities Ford was the most pleasant car purchase I ever experienced.  When I decided to purchase a new car, I requested information on a specific car via email from the salesperson that I purchased my current car from, Dave Kost.  I received a personal – just for me- virtual tour video of the make/model/color car I wanted later that day!

Dave was honest and up front about everything and made the process so fast and easy.  The finance guy didn't try to push me to buy the extended warranty or service package.

Thanks again for everything Dave and I love my new car!

Craig Ellis, who I have delt with personally has always given me the highest quality of customer service.  He knows me by name when I call in, and that means a lot.  Thanks you so much Park Cities Ford for the GREAT SERVICE!",5.0
49,"October 10, 2007","Trent, our sales guy was pleasant to deal with and we came to a reasonable purchase price. However the sale ended in F&I with Carlo, the finance manager, whom displayed the most dishonest disposition. I understand this is a business and profits are the goal, but do not treat customers like they are kids by giving constant runarounds and excuses that lean on the side of deceit. Buyers are well educated and should not be treated like kids in preschool. We will be taking our business elsewhere even if it means paying a premium to get the deserved honesty and respect.  ",1.5
50,"January 16, 2006","I made an agreement with Park Cities Ford to purchase a 2002 Focus only if they repaired a large dent and scratch on the roof of the car.  The representatives there kept delaying the repair job each time I spoke to them on the phone, and then after 30 days had passed they told me that the agreement had expired.  A time limit was never explained to me, and they blatantly did their best to ensure that they never had to hold up their end of the bargain.  A manager their took a very intense, in-your-face attitude and told me that it was in the fine print in the agreement that I signed.  Also, my Focus developed severe electrical problems a few weeks after purchase.  I would recommend staying far away from Park Cities' Used Cars area.",1.0
