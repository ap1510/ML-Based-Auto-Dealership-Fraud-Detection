0,"December 27, 2019",Just left this place- walked Round and looked at cars for 20 minutes - only people I saw were two you g people riding around on a golf cart- they passed me by twice and then again they stopped by me and just stared - finally asked if they could help me in a “I do t care”  voice - I am shopping for a caddy. They knew nothing - I left - headed to austin ,1.0
1,"September 06, 2019","My sales lady Debbie was AWESOME from start to finish no hassle.  She did everything she could to make sure I got my car.  

The Finanace manager Anthony Franklin followed up with a better experience, he made sure I got the car payments to where I needed them to be.  Overall I'd recommend anyone to buy here.  Great group of people to work with.",5.0

3,"February 28, 2019",Jan 2019 my son purchased a car that was said to be in great condition my son had the car 2 days and the car engine light came on. The car went back and their lame xxx no knowledge mechanics said nothing was wrong with it and they would turn off the light. My son took the car to Automax to get recalls done and they stated to my son it needed more than 4 thousand dollars worth of work so we contacted garlyn shelton Jake said there was nothing he could do and hung up in our faces. Went and got a service history of the car and seen at the bottom that the mechanic advised this car not be sold so they sold a car knowingly it had problems this shows garlyn shelton have a bunch of thieves and liars and very unprofessional people working there along with stealing innocent peoples money and selling unsafe cars that are garbage. ,1.0
4,"March 02, 2018","Purchased a used 2017 GMC Acadia Denali with 9,XXX miles on 1/26/2018. This is going to be rather lengthy so you might skip to the end for the summary. The vehicle had a check engine light for overheating when I went to leave after finishing the paperwork. They couldn't believe the vehicle overheated because it was traded in by an elderly lady and it had a perfectly clean service record. They told me an air bubble must have fried the coolant system sensor when they serviced it and it would be an easy fix. They gave me a loaner and said they'd deliver the vehicle when it was repaired. They delivered the vehicle about a week later. The vehicle overheated 3 times in the next two weeks. Landon Slaughter of Garlyn Shelton instructed me to take it to the local dealership for repair since I live out of town. The second dealership worked on it for 4 days and fixed it. It overheated again after 3 or 4 days. Again, I called Garlyn Shelton and spoke to Landon Slaughter and long story short he offered to purchase the vehicle back from me for $6,XXX less than I paid for it. Mind you I have owned this vehicle for less than a month and it had been in the shop for two weeks of the month. He advised me to return it to the local dealership since it was still under factory warranty since I wouldn't accept his offer. I got curious about the service record of this vehicle. I requested the service record from Garlyn Shelton 3 times. Finally I received the service record. The service record shows this vehicle had been serviced twice for the engine overheating before I purchased it (once in August and once at the end of December)... so much for the little old lady driving it. 
So essentially Garlyn Shelton sold me a vehicle with KNOWN overheating issues and then offered to buy it back for $6,XXX less than I paid for it less than a month later after it overheated 3 times... I've contacted the BBB, Attorney General, and GM due to the vehicle being serviced 5 times for the same issue and the dealing in bad faith by Landon Slaughter at Garlyn Shelton. 
MAKE SURE YOU CHECK THE SERVICE RECORD ON ANY USED VEHICLE at Garlyn Shelton... I would personally avoid this dealership at all cost since this isn't just a they charge too much or didn't repair my vehicle properly complaint. This is blatantly lying to a customer and putting the safety of my family in jeopardy.",1.4
5,"June 27, 2017","I can't begin to explain or describe how wonderful these people are at this location. One thing is certain: Bart, Jesse, Daniel, Kaitlyn, April, and Michelle are so authentic! They treat me like I am a God.

One Proud Customer,

6,"May 10, 2017","I can't stress this enough: it is the exemplary service provided by the Garlyn Shelton BMW Service team that makes me such a loyal Garlyn Shelton customer. 
 
Granted, I have purchased 7 BMWs in the past 12 years, so I obviously like the Sales team; but knowing I have THIS Service team that I can count on is what gives me peace of mind.
I am always impressed by their professionalism; how courteous everyone is; how pro-active and accommodating they are; and the care they take to explain what is being done/ what needs to be done and why.  It is a welcoming, comforting experience!  

They were even there for me when I was traveling to Magnolia and my sunroof ""exploded"".  My first instinct was to call MY Garlyn Shelton team.  Not only did they call The Woodlands BMW service center to let them know I was coming - - - they called me during the drive to be sure I was alright and after I arrived to let me know what to expect.   

I could buy a BMW anywhere.  I could never find a Service Team like this one anywhere else! 
Daniel, Bart, Jesse, Nickole, Kaitlyn, the rest of the 'unseen' service team and Garlyn Shelton BMW: THANK YOU.",5.0
7,"April 08, 2017","Do not buy from this dealership! Do not invest in any warranty!! Hey are dishonest and unethical!! I. I bought a Nissan from them with an extended warranty and after multiple issues on a vehicle that had less than 100,000 miles, with oil changes every 3000 miles, and multiple diagnostic fees, they supposedly fixed, they made up multiple excuses not to honor warranty! Will never buy a Nissan ever again! Had a 92 Nissan that was awesome! Had a Morano with electrical issues that they ""fixed"" but after warranty ran out, they couldn't fix it, even though they supposedly fixed under the warranty? 2012 Nissan Altima with multiple issues under warranty and they made every excuse not to fix. Ridiculous! Lesson learned! Beware! Don't make same mistake! ",1.0
8,"March 21, 2017",I moved back to the area 2 years ago and had a 328i that I took in for service and was impressed with how I was treated. I subsequently sold the car but recently decided to look at a new X1. I came back to Garlyn Shelton BMW because of that past great experience with service. And I am thrilled with my new X1 and how Twister Taylor took care of my purchase!,5.0
9,"February 23, 2017","My experience in purchasing my new BMW was top shelf.  Brent was my sales representative,  and was very friendly and honest.  They treat you like a part of the family here. The excellent service didn't stop there.  Landon was the finance representative,  and he went above and beyond in getting me into the vehicle that was perfect for me.  Bottom line is, I was treated like I was part of the family and they were going to take care of me with integrity and care.  If you are looking to purchase a BMW, look no furthur than Garlyn Shelton BMW in Temple.",5.0
10,"February 13, 2017",I would like to let everyone know that myself and family have bought multiple cars from Garland Shelton. The district manager Brian Duble has always taken care of us. This last purchase he made it so easy for me and my husband. He had Brent Bankston take care of us. Brent was extremely helpful as well as very professional. I recommend the dealership to anyone I know who is in the market for a vehicle. They treat you like family. We could not be more satisfied. I am an extremely satisfied customer!!,5.0
11,"January 16, 2017","I have always had great service support from Bart, Jesse and Daniel and now I can add Brent from sales for his tremendous efforts as well. Brent took the time to answer all my questions during two visits to the dealership and was extremely knowledgeable and patient. I decided to by a certified preowned 428i and it is an amazing car!",4.8

21,"January 27, 2012","I CAN NAME ONLY 3 EMPLOYEES THAT ARE GREAT AND 2 HAVE ALREADY LEFT CAUSE THEY SAW THE LIGHT ON WHAT REALLY GOES ON AT THIS DEALERSHIP!!!!


WORST Customer Service EVER!!!!!....3 STRIKES, YOUR OUT..... NEVER AGAIN ... LIES, LIES AND MORE LIES....

I JUST CALLED AND SPOKE WITH THE FINIACIAL PERSON, ROBERT (I THINK THAT IS HIS NAME) AND HE WAS EATING ON THE PHONE, HOW RUDE!!!!! NOT ONLY EATING BUT SMACKING AND REALLY DID NOT CARE ABOUT ANYTHING I WAS ASKING HIM ABOUT RETURNING MY LEASE TO THEM ON 1/21/12..... 

THERE ARE ONLY 3 PEOPLE THAT REALLY HELPED ME AND THAT IS WHY I PURCHASED 3 VEHICLES FROM THIS PLACE AND 2 HAVE SINCE LEFT AND IT IS BECAUSE OF THE WAY GARLYN SHELTON DOES DIRTY BUSINESS WITH PEOPLE.... NOT TO MENTION ON MY PURCHASE BEFORE THIS VERY LAST ONE, MY MERCEDES, I HAD MY TIRES LOOKED AT AND LONG STORY SHORT, THEY QUOTED ME ONE PRICE AND, I SAID, NO I WILL GO SOMEWHERE ELSE AND THEY SAID WELL HOLD ON, WE WILL CALL YOU BACK.... THEY CALLED BACK WITH A LOWER PRICE AND I SAID HOW CAN YALL QUOTE ONE PRICE AND THEN A DIFFERENT ONE WHEN THESE ARE SET PRICES?  THEY SAID, WELL WE WILL MAKE IT UP WITH SOMEONE ELSES CAR..... OMG!!!!!!!!!  

THEN PROMISED A CAR WHEN I BRING MY CAR IN FOR SERVICE AND I GET A MAZADA, REALLY.  OK, WELL, AT LEAST IT'S A CAR CAUSE THE NEXT TIME I HAD A SCHEDULED SERVICE APPT, I HAD TO PAY FOR A RENTAL BUT COULD GET MY MONEY BACK WEEKS AFTER RETURNING THE CAR, REALLY!!!!!! SOMETIMES I OPTED TO HAVE THE SHUTTLE TAKE ME BACK TO WORK IF IT WAS ONLY GONNA TAKE AN HOUR OR TWO BECAUSE IT WAS NOT WORTH ALL THE HASSEL TO HAVE TO MAKE COPIES INS, ID AND THEN PAY AND HAVE TO KEEP CHECKING MY BANK ACCT TO MAKE SURE MY MONEY WAS REFUNDED....AND I HAD TO WAIT FOR 30MINS BEFORE SOMEONE COULD TAKE ME BACK TO WORK ON MY 30MIN LUNCH BREAK.... IF I HAD A SCHEDULED APPT AND IT WAS SET UP TWO WEEKS IN ADVANCE, WHY SHOULD SOMEONE HAVE TO WAIT ON A SHUTTLE DRIVER WHEN THEY KNEW THEY WERE TO TAKE THEIR CUSTOMER BACK TO WORK... I SPECIFICALLY TOLD THEM WHEN I MADE THE APPT, I WOULD LIKE A CAR THAT IF YOU DO NOT HAVE A CAR FOR ME THEN PLEASE MAKE SURE SOMEONE CAN BRING ME RIGHT BACK.. THEY SAID, WELL WE ONLY HAVE A FEW CARS TO LOAN OUT AND I SAID, WELL I WONT BE BRINGING MY CAR IN FOR TWO WEEKS SO I AM ASKING IN ADVANCE AND SHE WAS DANCING ALL AROUND IT AND I SAID, SO WHO IS IT THAT DOES GET A LOANER AND SHE NEVER GAVE ME A STRAIGHT ANSWER….. 

I KNOW YOU SHOULD NEVER SAY NEVER, BUT I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER CAR FROM GARLYN SHELTON…

22,"May 20, 2007","After first talking with a salesperson from BMW of Austin and having him tell me that they would only show cars by appointment only I decided to go to Garlyn Shelton Imports.

Since Temple is a bit of a drive from Austin, I called the dealership on the phone.  I was able to spec out a car and get prices for lease payments on it.
The next day i went to Temple, signed the lease, and drove away about two hours later.  It seemed to be a smaller dealership.  We were the only customers there so we got lots of attention from all the staff.

I would recommend highly... in fact, I am buying another BMW from Garlyn Shelton Imports this summer.",5.0
