1,"September 13, 2012","As soon as we entered the lot and parked we were immediately approached by Karsten. And in a very kind and professional manner, he asked if we had been helped. From that point on it was a very pleasant experience. Karsten was friendly and offered us beverages to help cool us down from the hot sun that was blaring outside. I told him exactly what I was looking for and he not only did he find me a truck that I wanted but found me a truck that had all the accessories that I wanted in a truck and the one thing that it didn't have, he had them installed at no extra cost. 

We purchased a 2010 GMC Texas Edition with only 23,000 miles and it had the 20' chrome wheels, chrome package, awesome stereo system, bluetooth, etc..and the options go on and on. I was very excited to see that I was getting such a beautiful truck at such a low price. I did some research and found that I had gotten more for money. I looked on the internet, drove around and looked at the same model trucks that had the similar miles, packages etc..and could not find one that was at the price I was getting mine at. To make a long story short, my wife and I were very very happy with the customer service and the quality of the used trucks they had for sale.  I will continue to shop at Ancira when I am in the market for a new or used vehicle. Thank You Mr. Ancira for the great customer service and professional staff. You guys are awesome! 

your new friends,

2,"August 12, 2010","Although GMC evidently has a real winner with the Terrain it is not easy to come by.  After alot of research I made up my mind and made contact with Ancira GMC to purchase one.  Dallas was extremely pleasant to deal with and he kept me informed since I had to wait for an order he expected in the first part of August.  Once it arrived he did a great job throughout the dealer visit, and I certainly walked away a very, very satisfied customer.

I would highly recommend Ancira GMC to others and steer them Dallas' way.

As I told On Star when they set up my account 'I am in love with this car!', which brought a laugh from the young lady helping explain On Star and how to use it.  I was blown away with the directions give by the On Star system to get me back to work since I do not get to work via the route I would have to take.  After that I am even more in love with the GMC Terrain.

The wait time was short and they also serviced our car while it was there.  Shaun Adams was very nice, friendly and helpful, we will definetly be taking our car back when needed.  Service Department was exceptional!

5,"January 13, 2010","I insist on bringing my truck to Shaun in Boerne and I do not live in the immediate area any more.  I trust his recommendations and the service is second to none.  He always communicates what work is being done and always gives me a heads up for upcomming needs.
