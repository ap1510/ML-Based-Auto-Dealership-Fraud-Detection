In May 2019 I took my Landrover Evoque to Garcia Landrover of El Paso for a simple oil change and tire rotation.  A service that was supposed to be routine became a nightmare.  My vehicle's lug nuts WERE NOT tightened after the tire rotation and my wheel flew off in the middle of Mesa.  
After picking my vehicle up at the dealership, I began my drive back home to the west side of El Paso.  Almost immediately I heard a horrible, loud noise coming from the front of the car.  I immediately exited the freeway and called my service advisor.  I explained to him what was happening, and he stated that everything was fine and assured me that the technician had test driven the vehicle before I picked it up.  Against my better judgement and trusting his, I continued to drive my vehicle, but the noise continued to get worse.  I again stopped the car and called the service advisor at which time he repeatedly told me that everything was fine.  I was driving slowly up Mesa, the noise continued to get worse, all of the sudden I heard a loud crashing sound - my tire had completely fallen off of the car.  I happened to be in front of a fire station and the firemen ran out to help me.  They had to pry the door open in order for me to exit the vehicle.  There was extensive damage to my car.   I contacted Landrover immediately assuming that they would send someone out to help me, but they did not seem to be bothered by what had happened.  They stated that they would call a tow truck, but after waiting in the hot sun for an hour and a half a police officer called one and they arrived immediately. Nobody offered to come and pick me up and stated that the service department was closing at 1:00pm on Saturday so if I wanted a loaner I would need to pick the keys up from the General Manager.  When I arrived at the dealership, he was not only not sympathetic, but completely indifferent.  
Not only is their work obviously shotty, but they do not care about their customer's wellbeing.  I can't imagine what would have happened if this occurred on the freeway of if I had my young child with me.  I would recommend taking your Landrover anywhere else to be serviced, but here.

1,"January 15, 2017","Went in to pay cash for a Range Rover and it seems they assumed - for whatever reason - we were not serious, and refused to give us serious service.  Reported the incident to Land Rover North America, which never bothered to respond.  Since then I have seen many reviews of awful customer service from Land Rover dealers.  We bought a Cadillac Escalade instead - which is a much better vehicle, costs less to maintain, and has better service, in my opinion.  ",1.4
