0,"March 17, 2020","I purchased a 2016 Chevy Trax from this dealership, in November 2019.  Plagued with problems.  Car had a previous smoker, dealership took a week to rid me of this problem.  On-Star wasn't working, they did fix it, took three days.  Then squeaky breaks reported, prior to spring break, by wife and myself, as well as, possible back break locking up.  They tell us there is no problem. Muffler loose and they can't fix it, even though certified car.  Weather stripping coming up on top of car passenger side, they said they can't fix it.  i am wondering what: certified means"", apparently not much.  They had the car from March 10th, until March 17th, to tell us all they couldn't fix and what was wrong.  I will use another dealership for service, from now on.  ",1.5
1,"August 06, 2018","Purchased a used CPO 2017 Chevy Express van on 2/20/18 paying cash. Window sticker said the vehicle had a remote keyless entry. There was no remote key fob according to the salesperson, Josh. But he said he would get one for me and mail it (we live in AL and bought the van in Dallas). After several ignored emails I sent Josh requesting an update I finally bought a remote fob online and had it programmed (total cost $57.95). I contacted the General Manager on 6/1/18  and the next business day Josh emails me and asks me to send him the receipts for the purchase and I would be reimbursed. I sent those as attachments via email on 6/4 but still 2 months later have no reimbursement. During that time I made two more attempts to contact Josh for an update, but those were ignored as well.

Bottom line : You will be treated well and promised what you want to hear before the sale. Afterwards....don't hold your breath for any promises made and please don't expect to have any response to your attempts to contact them.",1.8
2,"January 12, 2018",I took my car to the service department and had to leave because no one would wait on me.  I have been calling and No answer.,1.2
3,"August 13, 2017","I brought my 2000 Impala to another chevy dealer in Arlington, which is located on I-20 just east of Cooper St.  My power steering had a whining noise.  This dealer put in a new power steering pump and new lines.  When I picked the car up it still made the same whining noise.  I told them it was not acceptable.  After three different attempts to fix it they at last told me they called the manufacturer of the pump and they said it was normal noise.  So I had to pay a large service bill and got nothing in return.  

Thee years later one of the hoses came off and all the fluid leaked out.  Chuck Fairbanks was the closest chevy dealer, so I brought it there.  Was reluctant to based on my service experience three years earlier.  Fairbanks put on a new hose.  When I started it up it made no more whining noise.  Boy was I pleasantly surprised. It just sounds great.  I don't know if I just got lucky or if the guy who worked on it just new what he was doing.  I will try Chuck Fairbanks again, but since my experience with the big name chevy dealer in Arlington, I have done all the repairs on my Impala myself, except for the one Fairbanks did.  After three years of listing to that noise I'm glad I found someone that new how to work on a power steering system.  ",4.6

5,"December 26, 2016","Used car salesman Mike Hollie fits all the negative stereotypes of a used car salesman.  He will lie to your face , look you in the eye, then tell you, ""you have my word.""  My vehicle was not delivered on the agreed upon date.  Mike lied about the original delivery time, said he would call me to confirm a time, then never called me back.  I was eventually contacted by the delivery man with no contact from the dealership.  I spent the better part of a Saturday in December at the dealership and saw almost no other customers.  Now it makes sense why-no integrity or customer service.  Mike also agreed and put in writing that The dealership would put caps on the plugs for the tires.  I realize that's a minor request, but it's something every vehicle should have.  He did not fulfill that promise.  The 172 point Inspection that is performed to make a vehicle Certified Pre-Owned, was probably pencil whipped.  They stated the vehicle had no scratches.  I found several on the hood.  This makes me question the integrity of the entire inspection if I was able to find that discrepancy.  I guess I'll soon find out.  ",1.2
6,"September 21, 2016","Sold my wife a 2015 caddy that came with broken radio, grille,vent knob and scratched up info screen.  When asked why salesman neglected to inform us of these defects, when we asked salesman Will Hood to inspect and condition because internet AutoTrader sale, they said its a as is sale.  Salesman Will told us that car was ""in showroom condition "".  When used car mgr was asked why they weren't returning calls or texts stated "" I wishyou would bring the car up her in person because he was a paratrooper for 35 years ""  confrontational and threatening in his manner.  And they wonder why salesman are lowest respected people next to politicians.  ",1.0
7,"February 05, 2016","We bought a used car for my son and Chris in the used car department assured us the car passed a multi-point inspections and was in great shape. Less than 30 miles and the check engine light came on.(very suspicious)  they refused to even look at it. Come to find out the car was very low on coolant and had only 2 quarts of oil. I think the passed the inspection with the engine light on, but cannot prove it. I will never be back and warn my friends. Stay away...

8,"August 07, 2013","when you buy a certified car one would think that the dealershp checked the vehicle, that was not the case. i quickly noticed that the steering was not straight so I had to take it back. even after that it was not corrected. on the paperwor they were suppose to touch up dings in the hood, never done, when I got the car it was dirty I had to take it to the car wash after delivery. after make two payments i contact about my tagsand started receiving excuse after excuse, so I contacted Chuck Fairbank himself who gave me another excuse and told me that he would have them by tuesday(4 Days) and that he wanted to personally meet me and told me to look him up when i got there, but on monday the sales guy call me to tell me he had the tags. when i got the to pick them i found out that disabled vet tags on one of my other vehicle had been unregistered and moved to the cheverolet i purchased from this dealership. i was upset to find out that this was done leaving me with a unregistered vehicle so i demand that they fix this and the next it was corrected. so on tuesday i went a asked for Mr. Fairbank as he had told me to do and a little young kid came close standing over me telling me that Chuck was to busy to see me. so after a little over a month in a half trying to get tags, paint chip issue, a clean car delivery, wheel align issues on a certified vehicle, and the small fairbank goon squad, I will never recommend or return to Chuck Fairbank at any location.",1.0
