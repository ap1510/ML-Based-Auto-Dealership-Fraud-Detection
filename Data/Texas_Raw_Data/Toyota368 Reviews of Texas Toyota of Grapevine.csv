0,"June 25, 2020","I took my 4-runner here in April of 2020 for recall work and also spent about $1300 in general maintenance/upkeep work they found I needed.   Since I have been there I have received 3 additional Toyota factory recall notices for same recall I was told they have fixed.  I called the main Toyota national # 3 times, in addition to calling the service department to see if there was a way to have the system stop sending me recall notices.  And also to confirm the work was actually done.   She was unfriendly and unhelpful saying ""I mean, it's in the system, you're probably just on their mailing list"" and told me there was nothing she could do about it.  My #1 concern is that I have no confidence the safety recall was actually done.  I guess for the amount of money I spent, I was surprised by the her tone of voice and lack of friendliness/helpfulness.  The service advisor and the lady who helped me with my bill on day of service were fine - no issues there.   An additional comment I would make about this dealership as compared to others I have been to - a nice perk is that many of them run your vehicle through a car wash when service is complete - its a benefit of being a Toyota customer.   I was disappointed when my truck was returned dirty after $1300 spent.   A little thing....but something that has them behind many other dealerships.  ",2.8
1,"June 23, 2020",Purchased a 2009 Chev Traverse in 2017. The absolute worst!! The transmission is going out and the shocks were bad from day one. Said they would fix the problem but instead handed me a bill for $1500 after i bought the car for $8500. Very dishonest dealership. If you are thinking about buying a pre owned from this dealership take it to a mechanic first. I wrote a warning review before and they quickly replied that they were sorry whoopty woo and i should give so and so a call to see how they could help....LMAO. I called and instead of fixing anything they wanted to put me in payments and work me over again. Whats sad is i had saved up for a car for a year and i had 3 kids under 12 at the time. My sales rep knew my story and how hard it was for me....Oh well just dont want to see another mom or anyone looking for a dependable car get raked over like i did. Beware....,1.0
2,"May 22, 2020","This is by far THE WORST dealership I have ever used! SOLD US A CAR WITH TRANSMISSION PROBLEMS AND AIR BAG PROBLEMS AND I HAVE THREE KIDS 5 AND UNDER! ALSO, it has TWO BUSTED SEATBELTS IN THE BACK! (let's not forget it had an open recall that they said was fixed.. but was not) NONE OF THIS WAS DISCLOSED TO US! The used manager Bruce and the used car director Omar will keep you there for HOURS while LYING TO YOUR FACE the entire time! They told us our deal was finalized (or they ""would take it back in a heartbeat) and they couldn't take the car back (after it's finalized) unless it had serious issues..what's more serious than transmission and air bag issues? (Btw, Bruce said it was finalized Saturday..Omar said Monday.. and we got EMAIL CONFIRMATION THAT IT WAS NOT FINALIZED UNTIL TUESDAY!!!!!) And we were there for FOUR HOURS MONDAY! While they lied to our faces saying it was finalized! We even dropped the car off there Tuesday because they said they would have the Ford house do repairs.. WHICH THEY DIDN'T DO CAUSE WE HAVE A TICKET OF WHAT THEY ACTUALLY TOLD THE FORD HOUSE TO DO!! Omar AND Bruce told us they wouldn't want their family in a car like that.. but they're okay with my family and myself being in it? What makes their family more important than mine?? We reached out to the GM and he never got back to us, just had other people call for him. They're liars and do not care about you, they only care about making money! STAY FAR FAR AWAY FROM THIS DEALERSHIP!!!!!!!!

I WISH I COULD LEAVE NEGATIVE STARS!!! ALSO, OMAR OFFERED A RENTAL TO GET OUR INSURANCE TO FINALIZE THE DEAL RIGHT UNDER OUR NOSES!!!!!! THEY ARE SCAMMERS!!!!!!!

ALSO OVERCHARGED STICKER PRICE! AND THEY DON'T GO OVER THE CONTRACT WITH YOU CAUSE THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO SEE IT!",1.0
3,"May 08, 2020","Every time we take my car in for just an oil change (WITH an appointment time), we are stuck here ALL DAY. It is absolutely ridiculous how long it takes to change oil. If you have your vehicle in at your time slot, they should be able to change oil within an hour...maybe two. Do not schedule service here unless you want to spend your entire day sitting at this dealership!!!!!",1.5
4,"May 05, 2020","I bought my wife a car for Christmas from Toyota grapevine. A pre owned 2019 Toyota Camry in December. The car fax came back clean. In February I started noticing paint bubbling and was peeling off the bumper.I contacted Toyota and they had me send them some pictures of the bumper. After waiting over a month with no communication I contacted them again. They said the gentleman I sent them to was out due to covid-19 and they needed me to send them more pictures. after sending the pictures they then wanted me to drive back out to grapevine with the car so they could inspect the under bumper. (I live 65 miles one way from the dealership) I made the appointment and drove to grapevine, only to have the service department manager tell me that the bumper was an after market bumper, and when it was painted it was improperly prepped so they were not going to help me. If I had bought this vehicle from a no name car lot I would expect this type of thing, but not from a multi billion dollar company that is normally known for a great product and service. I now have a car with a defective bumper that I never would have bought 6 months ago if it looked the way it does now. Very dissatisfied, what happened to the time when companies stood behind their product. ",1.0
5,"April 24, 2020","Total scammers! Worst experience. Hoping to save time, we had worked out the pricing terms via email prior to coming to the dealership to sign paperwork and pick up the car. Our financing was pre-approved through USAA. It took them 3 1/2 hours to bring us the final loan paper, but it was TOYOTA financing not USAA! They said they could not do outside financing because of COVID-19 and we would just have to refinance with USAA later (LIE!). When we threatened to leave, suddenly USAA financing was okay. What a CROCK!",1.6

7,"April 01, 2020",I went to Toyota of Grapevine and was able to get everything smoothly and efficiently done within just a few hours thanks to their great sales people and staff.

9,"March 09, 2020","Wow! Words can not describe the phenomenal customer service offered to me by Joey A at Toyota of Grapevine. I recently got in a car accident and totaled my car, and I can’t say that I was happy when I found out I’d be buying a new car and taking on a car payment. I’m a 25 year old female, and you can imagine the warnings I get when car shopping by myself with none of my family available to help. Joey A was extremely patient, informative, and took away a lot of the stress and apprehension that I was feeling, and he made sure that I knew I was making the best decision possible. He took the time to ask me questions about what I was looking for, compared different years/trim levels and features, and made sure I was confident that I was getting the right car for me! I can not thank him enough, as well as everyone else involved in my purchase. It really does make all the difference when you can trust the salesman you’re buying from. I look forward to doing future business with Texas Toyota of Grapevine! Thank you, Joey!",5.0
10,"March 06, 2020","I had been looking for a 4X4 truck for a month.   Tacoma's were at the top of my list and when I saw what I wanted at Texas Toyota of Grapevine, I gave them a call.   Sean Patterson took my call and he hung in there with my while I had a couple of other things come up before I could make our appointment.  When we did get together he had commanding knowledge of vehicle and it' features as well willingly working with me to meet my price point and trade in value.  It didn't take long to get through the finance process and drive my Tacoma off the lot and to the house.   It was a great experience and a great truck.  I'll throw their name around with a smile.",4.7
11,"February 22, 2020",Recently bought a used Toyota from Hertz. Realized later that it didn't have a front license plate holder. Went to Toyota of Grapevine and they took me right in and put one on free of charge. Also put on my back plate. Good service.,5.0
12,"February 21, 2020","I Bought a pre-owned Camry today and just gotta brag about how great, fast, and easy the experience was. Joey A. made sure I was taken care of from the moment I walked in until the moment I drove off with my new vehicle. I’ve purchased from other dealerships and it’s always been a hassle and a long and frustrating thing to deal with. But thanks to Joey A. I was in and out quickly and not to mention got an amazing deal! Toyota Grapevine will is now my go to from here on out. Everyone here was extremely helpful and I definitely recommend this dealership to anyone looking for great customer service. Thanks again Joey A!!! ",5.0
13,"February 08, 2020","Took my car here to get a state inspection, it took them over 2 hours to tell me it wouldn't hook up to the machine and to come back another time for a diagnostic test. I bring it back the next week and left it all day (7:30-5) just for them to tell me they didn't have enough time to diagnose it. I called a few times before driving there to see if I could check on the progress but my assigned service representative never picked up the phone and when calling the general parts department they assured me they would have him call me back. He never did. When I showed up a few minutes before they closed for the night (since I needed my car the next day) they seemed surprised to see me and asked for another 15 minutes. About 30 minutes later he comes to me and tells me the exact same things he told me the week before, that it wouldn't connect to the machine and there was a problem with the wiring that they didn't have enough time to diagnose. The story is they spent a few hours total off an on over the course of the day looking at it, but if they had really spent that long on it they would have had some new info for me and wouldn't have rushed to do a quick diagnostic after I arrived to take it home. Regardless, even if they had spent a few hours looking at it, there was 0 communication and I got slapped with a hefty diagnostic fee when they didn't even diagnose anything. Thus far I have wasted many hours with this shop and spent a lot of money for nothing short of wasted time. I don't plan on wasting any more money here",1.0
14,"January 29, 2020","Send my wife up here to purchase a vehicle she wanted.  She dealt with Mr. Mahmoud Alnasser who she said was very nice.  When it comes time to sign all of the paperwork, she was dealing with a Mr. Bruce Jackson.  Mr. Jackson tried to throw on a $1300 ""reconditioning fee"" which he claims covers the cost to make the vehicle ready to sale, including maintenance they did (oil/filter change and wipers).  This is classic bait and switch.  Be wary of the fact that they will try to throw on fees and the price you see listed on the website is not the price you will get.",1.0

21,"October 25, 2019","July2019 - Went with a complaint saying why  coolant reservoir keeps draining out. They did all analysis of radiator and what not and said radiator is leaking. 1.2K spent on replacement of radiator. Guess what after a week coolant is drained out again. Now they said well we will top it off keep monitoring it. 

October 2019 - next service i went in told the issue about coolant draining out. 
Well we need to check everything again. Ok - 2 - 3 hours. Never got a call back after 4 hours. 
Called the service rep. He said we found a hole in reservoir !! Well how come it was not found earlier.

I never had to do anything with a reservoir in first place. Reservoir is not a moving part at all.
What should be done 100 $ reservoir tank. We don't have part. So what was done for 4 hours ?
Very suspicious on what has been done on the car. 

Are they solving problems or creating problems ???

Said thanks to their service.. by the way the service technician is recommending more services.. 
Hope the team did not create the problems for service recommendations !!!

Avoid.

You may end up with problems than having your problems resolved.

Very rude sarcastic remarks by manger - when i said i will look for reservoir tank his comments "" Go find it you will get a whisky bottle "".

22,"October 15, 2019",I just bought a car from Toyota Grapevine and the experience wasn't that good. I got a bad salesperson named Sean. The car was missing a key and he didn't tell me that until we close the deal. He was so pushy and doesn't let you make a decision. I trade a car in a He doesn't explain to you how much you gonna get for the trade-in or your APR or loan terms or any breakdown. When I asked about that information he told me that don't worry you get the best deal which I doubted. STAY AWAY FROM SEAN IF YOU ARE GOING TO THIS DEALERSHIP. ,2.2
23,"September 20, 2019","William Lomax is a HORRIBLE sales rep!!!
Has no emotion and no personable skills.
The dealership lost a for sure sale due to his attitude and his lack of communication.
I dealt with Douglas today at lunch and he was amazing if he was here this evening he would have had the sale for sure!!
I will ensure everyone knows not to go here due to our treatment.",1.4
24,"September 17, 2019","Went in to look at the new Supra. 
#1 - There was only the factory window sticker on the window indicating that the price was MSRP. So I'm a little surprised when the salesman tells me that there is a dealer markup on top of that. It took 30 minutes or so to pry the price out of them. That was only after a couple trips from the ""manager"". It started out as a $15k markup BTW.
#2 - If you have a possible trade, be prepared to demand your keys be returned. Must be part of their ""sales"" technique to hang on to your keys to keep you from leaving.",1.2

26,"September 14, 2019","I'll make this short and sweet, because I have several places to post this review.  It took me more than 7 HOURS to get this dealership to sell me the car at the price they advertised.  I paid cash.  Most of the time spent at a dealership ends up being with financing - that was not the case.  The amount of additional services they push... no, FORCE on you is nothing short of ridiculous.  This kind of selling should be illegal.  I feel bad for first time car buyers or folks who are unfamiliar with these tactics because there is a high chance this dealership took advantage of them.  Would not recommend to anyone I cared about... might recommend to an enemy.",1.8
27,"September 13, 2019","I purchased a vehicle from this dealership in April 2019. I emailed the General Manager back in May 2019 about the concerns I had about the purchase process. No response or acknowledgement of the email or concerns. However, he was quick to respond when I initially expressed  an interest in buying a vehicle from his dealership in April.
I never had a follow-up contact by the salesman or the dealership. 
I would advise anyone looking for service after the sale or good customer service Look for Another Dealerships! Also, beware that a “Fully Detailed” vehicle means the salesman drives the vehicle through the automatic car wash!

29,"July 23, 2019","Do not... and I repeat... do not... even mess with these people. I’m a very strong woman and didn’t heed other peoples’ warnings and it has caused me so much grief. From the lies (being told I could be in and out in 20mins) to how the sales took my keys and wandered off so I could leave... then I had to ask for them repeatedly... to then being told just twenty more minutes... and didn’t leave until four hours later. Dirty, scuzzy, and unsafe. Would never go there again. I hope they go out of business.

Oh, and P.S. in case the dealer tries to come on here and tell me to call Neal Assad, their general manager, I HAVE LEFT SIX MESSAGES FOR YOU. Trying to get my f*ing paperwork copies. It’s clear that they could care less once you sign and drive away. Ugh. Wish I could do the whole thing over. Would never have bought from these lowlifes. ",1.0

31,"June 20, 2019","I bought a 33000 mile rental Corolla. Haggled for two hours to negotiate 15000.00 walk-out price. Then a HIGH PRESSURE finance guy takes us to back room to sign papers. He lectured us for 2 hours on why we had to buy MPP extended warranties. Finally got tiered of arguing with him and settled for just a fraction, 3600.00. Interest for 1st time buyer with excellent credit was 8.9 percent. 1st salesman said I could refinance for 4 percent in 6 months. It’s actually a year. Glad the nightmare is over! ",1.7

33,"June 14, 2019"," I recently purchased a used car from Toyota of Grapevine. During the purchase I was reassured that the vehicle had been thoroughly checked, anything needing repaired was repaired. The day after purchasing the vehicle, having driven under 100 (from dealership,home and work), the check engine light came on. I took it to my regular technician and was informed the turbo has a leak, he told me the dealership should cover this repair since it had been such a short time frame from purchase. I contacted the dealership regarding the repair, I was informed by Joseph and Matt (the salesman) that they would not cover this repair as the vehicle was sold ""as is"".

34,"May 21, 2019","I give this a -1 for dishonest business practices. Grapevine Toyota(Texas Toyota) added a charge to my financing of $1200 and did not tell me about it.

35,"April 08, 2019","These are very very very bad people. If you are a first time buyer or anyone who plans on buying a car from these guys as a guy who purchased a car from 

these people, DO NOT!!! I REPEAT DOOOO NOT buy from them but if you decide to risk your luck I will do my best to let you know what you're up against so 

you can have the upper hand. So I was a first time buyer and my sales man was MIGUEL CARDENAS. This was my first car so I literally checked car selling 

websites every day for 3-4 months about 5 times a day to see if the car would be eventually sold by and OFFICIAL TOYOTA DEALERSHIP!!! After the time span 

passed I finally found one at toyota of grapevine where I was greeted by MIGUEL CARDENAS. This guy seemed very nice and friendly he showed me the car it 

was a little beat up in person (but on the website they used images from when when the car was brand new) with a dent that I figured could pop out(Needs a 

whole new door) and the hood that was misalligned, it look minor but it was(frame damage). So I made an appointment with miguel where it took 1 hour to 

drive 1 hour back but we sat there for 2 hours to see MIGUEL but he was working with another customer. Then eventually he came to us but the dealer was 

closing so he talked me into putting down a 500 dollar payment to reserve the car I thought this was a good idea cause this car sells like hot cakes.(DONT 

DO THIS BE PATIENT THERE WILL BE ANOTHER CAR LIKE THE ONE YOU WANT THEY DO THIS TO PERSUADE YOU TO BUY IT) Thinking back now I believe this was planned so 

be careful. Now this is where I notice really sketchy stuff here is where I went to sign the papers that listed how much I made so I put how much I made 

and under I put how much I made from additional services. MIGUEL then checks with his manager who I believe his name is KEITH?(not sure he is a very large 

tall white guy always at computer hes a manager!) But he comes back and tells me to put the additional income and gross into one(LIE). Listen up first time 

buyer here is where they tried screwing me over with large monthly payments you can tell them where you want to be, I got payments I wanted. I also wanted 

to negotiate the price but these guys are so slick that they didnt tell me when it was time to negotiate but for first time buyers its anytime before you 

sign anything! And always get someone to go with you with exp in buying cars or phone some these guys like to use the line ""is your friend paying your car 

payments?"" dont listen call whoever they try to talk loud and over you to get in your head. So i go to sign papers where I meet a guy named SHON. Let me 

tell you this guy is something else he tried pushing the warranty on me so hard telling me ""this is what I have"" but I kept saying no(THE WARRANTY IS 

COMPLETE TRASH EVEN A GUY OUT OF THE SERVICE CENTER TOLD ME STRAGHTFORWARD AND ITS FROM A BAD COMPANY). Not sure what happens but BRUCE(tall african 

american) comes out telling me he got me an employee discount on the warranty me thinking I got a deal I took it! in reality the warranty can be 

negotiated...he LIED! So both SHON and BRUCE kept telling me if I dont like the warranty I could cancel whenever I wanted NOT TRUE!!!!! you have 15 or 30 

days to cancel!! these guy are so...... JUST DONT LISTEN DONT BUY WARRANTY. So no im goign to sign papers and this guy bruce is pressuring me sooooo hard 

to sign the papers like really bad he starts yelling and everything then i got pissed and i told him that youre not going to pressure me into buying a car 

at this point he gets angry and tells me he has other clients an walks off and get son the phone with another customer. But I called a few people and I got 

2500 knocked off of the price they tried adding on charge for ""services and fess"" which is something they added on to put more money in their pocket 

everything is negotiable and this is where you can negotiate car price. I signed worst decision ever def buyers remorse id ont regret buying a car but i 

regret buying from these ppl. I bought the car and didnt have no where to put it so i left it at the dealer for a few days and miguel calls me and says 

theres a tow truck that comes and towes cars at night that arent supposed to be on the lot!! LIE!!! later i realizd he did this because as long as I havent 

taken it off the lot I can still return the vehicle, all of these guys are scammers and liars. Next I tookt he car home and it rains hard and there is 

water leaking all in the trunk I mean atleast 4 gallons it ruined the back seats and I had to take the trunk interior out. I called miguel cardenas and I was extremely patient with this guy I was letting him tend to other customers and he told me he would call me back he never called me and he had the audacity to tell me that he called me a lot of times(lie) when I eventually got in contact with him by GOING 1 HR AWAY TO THE DEALER! When I got there they asked if I had warranty I had cancelled it but I told them yes cause I knew they were using it as a scapegoat but they told me to go to the service center and the guys in the service center tell me the warranty is a paperweight. The guys in service center told me to see if the dealer would pay the 100+ service fee.....long story short they didnt! But I go and ask for a manager and this guy who has crooked eyes comes up to me he tells me hes a manager(lie) and he calls miguel for me who is obviously at this point avoiding me. But the guy calls miguel and miguel tells him the story over the phone instead of comign to me an speaking with me like hes supposed to and the crooked eyes guy walks me to my car and tels me to patch up a crack. This is my story and I am only posting this to help out the poor future victims I wouldnt take a free car from these guys these are professional scammers who prey on innocent people who simply want a good car. These guys really make toyota I made the mistake of trusting this dealership because it was toyota big nono. If you are a 1st time buyer look elsewhere i dont care how far you have to go dont go here dont dont dont. And I forgot to mention when I walked into this dealership to fix the rain in my car I turned my head and I saw the manager Keith and the crooked eyes guy laughing at me and the quickly looked away as I turned my head towards them. Look at all of the negative reviews, read them, they arent there for no reason, the good reviews are most likely from rich ppl who forked over a lot fo money for a new car.

38,"February 21, 2019","BUYER BEWARE!!! THEY WILL LIE TO YOU!!! 
Stopped in on a Friday and they had a car I liked, except that it needed two new tires. We negotiated two new matching tires into the cash price and they said it would probably ready for pickup on Monday. I told them I needed it right away and that there was another car at another dealer that was ready to go, so I told them thanks for their time. They then came back and said the tires were already ordered so it could be ready on Saturday. I agreed to the deal, signed the paperwork, and gave them the money. Saturday came and they said the tires didn't come in. Said they were an uncommon type of Michelin and that they'd be in for sure on Monday. This created ALOT of inconvenience on my end which I won't go into. Monday comes and they said it would be ready early evening. I cancelled all my plans that night so me and my wife can drive 45 miles one way to pick it up. Then I get a call to say that it won't be ready until Tuesday. I told them we no longer have a deal cause this was creating more inconvenience for me and my family. Then Patrick calls me and says it WILL be ready that night. I said ok...I just needed the transportation at this point. Couple hours later my salesman sends a text... It won't be ready until Tuesday. Tuesday comes and I'm headed to pick it up around 6 in the evening. I am trying hard to bite my tongue as I enter the dealership...I just wanna get the keys and get out of there. It was cold and raining so I basically got the keys and jumped in the car without giving it a look. First thing that happens when I start the car is notice that the nav screen is asking for a code. The radio was also asking for a code and this is standard with any Acura when the battery is disconnected. They never bothered to rest everything before they delivered it and after they did God knows what to it. The next day I had to call Acura and give them the VIN so I could get the codes. Also on the next day, I look at the tires and notice that they put two DIFFERENT tires on the front. I now have two Michelins and two Goodyears. This is not what was promised and what I agreed to. Furthermore, EVERYBODY knows that you always put two new tires in the BACK and the worn tires in the front. Texas Toyota demonstrated incompetence from the sales person to the service tech and in their management. Total disregard for respectable customer service is what I experienced. ",1.6

These guys will lie straight up in your face and don't mind backing out of any promise they made to make more money. If you decide to go there just stick to your word. Make sure to read every document before signing. If you have your own financing which is better to have refuse to fill out a credit app because they will. Nael Asaad emailed me after my first visit there, but when I gave him my feedback he didn't bother to call me or respond back to my email. I filled out the GM survey the next day, but he also didn't bother to resolve any of the issues I had that's why I am here writing this review after he had the chance to take care of it internally. Bruce Jackson called my brother and after a heated discussion he told him I don't care if you send a complaint to corporate or write a bad review online. Omar told us when we were there, if you are not happy you should leave. To my understanding when you have an unhappy customer because you didn't fulfill your promise you should go out of your way and make this customer happy. This is how you gain repeat customers. Definitely never again Texas Toyota at Grapevine and may be never any of Berkshire Hathaway dealers.",1.6
40,"January 21, 2019","BEWARE: Their sales tactics are very dishonest and they will sell you a defective car and tell you its your problem now.

I had the worst car buy experience of my life with Toyota of Grapevine. The 2 salesmen and the finance individual were very very dishonest. The first issue I had was one of the salesman acting dumb and pretending he did not know what I'm talking about when I told him I did not want the ZAKTEK warranty. The Zaktek warranty is a 3 year deal that costs $1300 where they would apply a coat every 6 months to help keep the car looking shinny. I simply did not want the 3 year deal but he kept on stating that they already applied the first coat and we cannot remove it. That did not make sense to me...

The second issue is when I contacted them a few hours after driving the car off the lot due to smoke coming out of the engine area. I wanted to get an idea of what my options are. I was basically told I have to deal with this issue myself once the car leaves their parking lot. I am not able to return the car... buyers beware!!!",1.6
41,"January 15, 2019","Absolutely terrible! I am in sales and was baffled how they treated me. They sold a car right out from under me. They texted me 15 minutes before they were closing to say, ""Sorry.. we sold the car to someone else."" The salespeople make promises that apparently they are not authorized to do but do so anyway.

Providing good service is one of the most important things that can set your business apart from the others of its kind. Don't waste your time here. There are so many other dealerships in DFW that treat you with respect and provide superior customer service!",1.4
42,"December 18, 2018","After monitoring the online pricing of a vehicle of interest for several weeks, the pricing continued to come down since the vehicle would not sell.  The pictures of this vehicle appeared to reflect one in very good condition, albeit with high mileage.  Given the apparent condition of the vehicle, the latest/current online pricing became acceptable to me as a buyer.  Therefore  with relative certainly of a purchase -- barring no surprises when seeing the vehicle first hand, and taking the requisite test drive -- I made arrangements to come up to the dealership from Austin, TX.  This included the cost of renting a vehicle, and adjusting my schedule to make the 3+ hour drive from Austin to Grapevine.  

When I arrived at the dealership, the vehicle was close to the building entrance, and I immediately noticed the front windshield had a crack, which extended from the edge of the passenger side of the window, all the way to the center.  This damage was clearly not reflected in the close-up pictures on the dealership website.  After an evaluation of the vehicle (interior/exterior/test drive) with John Ballard, a dealer rep, I asked about the window damage and what the dealership's intentions were regarding a credit -- since I clearly stated before my trip that I wanted to ensure all was well with the vehicle and there were no surprises -- which the window with a crack half its width certainly was.   

 It was clear Ballard had no decision-making authority and therefore called over the Internet Director, JD Minor, with whom I had also been in communication regarding  this purchase.  Minor in fact confirmed that there had been no damage to the windshield reflected in any of the online pictures, but claimed he was not aware of the damage, and/or how it occurred.  Incredulously, he further stated that since the vehicle price had been reduced, he could not reduce it any further to compensate for the cost of replacing the window, and therefore he would not give any credit for its requisite repair.    

This dealership posture was simply unacceptable; however, I advised Ballard and Minor that I would research the cost of the window repair over lunch.  After further consideration I decided I was simply not going to absorb the $250-$300 cost of the damage -- that wasn't identified when the purchase arrangements were being made in good faith with the dealership reps -- Minor and Ballard.  With an apparent dealership policy that would seem to state:  ""If there is damage to the vehicle that results after the  online pictures used in the advertisement of the vehicle have been taken,  and the dealership chooses not to correct the problem, too bad for the customer, who must take the vehicle with the new damage, or walk.""  I chose the latter.  This incredibly deceitful and dishonest dealership business practice, showing a clear lack of customer regard, has clearly resulted in the loss of the imminent sale of this vehicle.  However, it has further resulted in a very significant hit to Toyota of Grapevine's credibility and integrity.

46,"October 30, 2018","I shouldn’t have even bothered with a second visit after the car I was originally trying to see wasn’t ready and they “couldn’t find it”. Mind you, I was taken by the salesman through their garage and to a dimly lit parking lot of cars “pre-inspection” at night. Ick. Awkward and unorganized. Fast forward to Monday, I get a call saying the Q60 I wanted to see on Friday is ready. I also mentioned that there were two others I wanted to see. Car #1: pen marks on the leather and coffee had been spilled in the centre console and remnants dried to the side of this lightly colored interior. Of course I said something about the state of the car, to which Gus responded “we just got this and haven’t had time to detail it”.
IF IT’S NOT CLEAN, WHY ARE YOU SHOWING IT? 
The alignment was off as well. 
Car #2 15 minutes waiting and they grab the wrong keys, they try to find them...Oh wait, “it’s not here”. Maybe it sold? I don’t know.
Car #3 reverts back to the car driven on Friday that was shown in place of the car they couldn’t find. Low tire pressure lights are on and there are cosmetic issues...one side of the bumper was damaged and the headlight cover was cracked. Again, I said that wasn’t acceptable to me. Their response: “you can buy clips on Amazon for that”. If you’re commanding a price of almost 30k for a luxury car that’s a year old and it’s so “easy to fix” why don’t you do it? Also, why are you acting like fixing a cosmetic issue is part of negotiation? 
So here I am waiting and irritated as Gus and Tommy talk to their sales manager, who comes over to chat with me about the two cars. He asks if he can drive with me in both. Keep in mind, I wasted an hour and a half already and I just want to go home. Your staff is aggressive, rude, and unorganized. It’s a lot easier to admit you’re unprepared rather than wing it. How anyone has reported a “great, amazing, best experience ever” clearly hasn’t had their expectations exceeded. 
 I have a positive from this though, I purchased elsewhere later this afternoon and it was worth driving 20miles out of the way as opposed to 2miles from my house. ",1.2
47,"October 28, 2018","FRAUD ALERT

THE FINANCE REP AHMAD RAHIMI IS A FRAUD. 

He literally LIED to my face. I'm so thankful I looked through the documents and figured it out.

Long story short:
Rahimi was our financing guy. The first thing my boyfriend asked him was to give us the payment amount that did not include any warranties or services. But he tried to keep convincing us to buy a warranty and we continuously kept denying adding warranties or services to our car. He gave us a number and claimed this is the monthly payment without ANY warranties or services. He then left the room and returned saying he would give us a warranty for only $10 more a month. Which was shocking since he dropped the price of the warranty by over 80%. My boyfriend asked him how that's possible and Rahimi said something along the lines of, ""I can do it. Don't worry about it"". We still declined the offer. He then leaves and returns a few minutes later and says, ""I'm going to throw in the MPP Silver Protection Plan for free for one year"". We say fine and sign the documents...

Turns out, the payment amount he claimed that didn't include any warranties actually did. The whole time the number he gave us already included the year-long ""free"" warranty. So I'm basically paying for the warranty...He LIED to our faces. He's a FRAUD. I cannot BELIEVE he lied to us. Pathetic.

I asked for someone higher, and met with the gentleman who is responsible for the sales team and he had nothing else to say but to make excuses. Basically, they just want to do false advertising to get people in the door and then charge them extra.

Here are the issues I experienced:
1. I wanted a window tint and was never even asked what kind of tint I need. I was just told it will be $200 and that's it. The tint was not at all what I wanted. The manager told me they never ask their customers what tint they want. Terrible customer service standards.
2. When I got my car back from service, it had really bad sticky dirty hand marks all over the back window. I had to go back in the dealership and ask them to clean it.
3. They charged , $114 + tax for the service of my car, and I'm not even sure if the service was performed because the sticker they put on my car says that the next service is already due as soon as I drove out of the dealership.
4. I called Toyota of Grapevine four times to confirm if service was done, and every time I was told that Robert was out or on vacation, and manager John will call me back, but I never ever received a call back.

It looks like a big fraud going on in the service department that the dealership should be aware of. I am never EVER going back to this dealership for ANY service or purchase. I've been to other dealerships like Toyota of Irving and Toyota of Dallas before and they have been great every time. Texas Toyota of Grapevine is the worst. Please avoid them at all cost!

But wanted the car so made the deal and left to go to credit union, finalize loan and bring back trade in.

""I honestly don't know where to start for this review. I want to say that ironically the sales person was nice and not aggressive. I also want to say that the original car I was looking at was not doable as it was used and wouldn't work with what I wanted and was bringing to the table. Which all of that was fine. I was very clear that I didn't need a car, just was looking to see my options. I understand loan to value has limitations and my personal parameters have limitations. I would have entertained more options if the following did not happen, I have never written a review that will include a name here as I know customer service especially in sales is yes, a stinky job and lots of pressure, but no need to be treated the way I was today!  

One of the finance Managers: David W.  Originally came over with my sales guy as what happens when in that process at every dealership. At first I could tell David's attempt at genuine customer service was lacking and felt forced,  but hey none of us are perfect right? We all have bad days? Well when I outlined what was presented to me that it's just not the right fit, David grew very impatient and then proceeded to become aggressive and throw what I can only describe as a tantrum of sorts. His tone became extremely condescending and outright rude. They have you initial a non-binding piece of paper that says what your looking for. He proceeded to accuse me of committing to it in an accusatory way in which I turned to my sales person for clarification (his face seemed to be surprised at the situation) then David increasingly rude ran over to his area and back and said did you not sign this?! Flapping the paper in a derogatory manner.  I said I agreed to nothing that which was presented to me. I then at that moment was in shock that I was truly being spoken to and addressed in that manor. I'm a customer service supervisor myself and have taken dozens of escalations in my life I would be fired if I ever treated anyone in this fashion. I said I do not like where this has turned. I honestly didn't know what to say or do. He and the sales person took a time out and then David came over and he discovered he had missed something on my credit and it wasn't even doable anyway?! Lol.  
My poor sales guy tried to deescalate the situation and was just talking with me. And I honestly would have considered other options and they threw out things, but I just wanted to get my keys and go home. I told my sales guy I was sorry and that it wasn't him, and that it is all David's doing for acting that way. I actually felt bad for him!  
So I left. And this could be a coincidence but my car was pretty blocked in and David was out there for a smoke...no proof of that tho. 
My sales guy had some other finance manager call me while I was on my way home. I said I can review things If you want and he said he would send me an email this afternoon with other vehicle options,  but even checking my junk mail it appears I have not received a thing lol- so not sure what happened there. 
This is one of the worst customer service experiences I've ever had, but it is a great example of coaching I will be able to use with my representatives on what not to do.    ",1.6

79,"August 05, 2016",Just bought a 2016 Prius 3 Touring.   It is a great car and after a month we are still enjoying it.   Roger was great to show us all the bells and whistles and how to operate them.   We were trading in a 2004 Saturn Ion.   I must admit that the purchase process reminded me why I bought Saturns in the past.  With Saturns there was no haggling and the price was the price whether you bought the car on line or from a dealer.  I never like the negotiation process and while I realize this is just part of the process in buying cars today I do not think anyone could honestly say they enjoy the buying process.   That said we honestly liked our sales representative and found him to be very knowledgeable of the car and all its features.   He is an asset to the dealership.   In the past I have often discuss cars with sales people and it became apparent I had done more research than they had.   This was not the case with Roger.,4.5

I give him the highest recommendation, so if you are ever in need of a  vehicle John Cross is your man.

After waiting for the person for our appt (they weren't ready at 10:30), we went for an appraisal drive in my current vehicle (trade-in). I had been there for at least an hour before the sales guy went to get the key for the vehicle that I was planning to purchase.  Comes back after a while to tell me that it was loaned to a corporate exec and was parked at the airport and wouldn't be back until Monday. I drove over 30 minutes in good faith for this appt. I was going with financing already arranged and ready to sign on the dotted line. I asked about another vehicle similar, but wrong color that JUST showed up on the website the night before. Sales guy went to get that key. Came back after about 15-20 minutes later to tell me that it had sold 3 days ago (2 days prior to being listed on the web). Then they offered me peanuts for my trade-in.

Also, the email from the GM sounding interested in my feedback from my meeting??  Ha. After my visit to Toyota of Grapevine, I received another email from the ""GM"" expressing thanks for my visit.

As soon as I walked in I was greeted with a warm welcome from Dennis Alberto. I told Dennis my issue and he went above and beyond to make sure I was taken care of. He was not the typical sales guy he was genuinely concern and was not just looking to get a sale. I was planning for my son's party that was that day and did not really have the time to stay at the dealership all day. I had to leave and told Dennis that I would come back another day because what I was initially shown was not going to work for me. Dennis gave me his card and told me he understood I had to leave and to call back so that we can setup another date and time that was convenient for me. Well, less than 15 mins later he called back and advised that he talked to his sales manager and they found something that would be a great deal and something that I was looking for in car. I came back that evening and Dennis showed me the car and it was PERFECT....2016 Toyota Corolla. The paperwork was ready to go all that was needed was my signature, even the gentlemen Adam Bekkali that helped me with the financial side was SUPERB. This Toyota dealership treats you like family and Dennis was AWESOME. He made sure that I was taking care of and treated me with exceptional customer service. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!!!

158,"February 28, 2016","I purchased a car on President's Day weekend through the Costco Auto Program and am very happy with my purchase. I had a great car-buying experience with Dennis Alberto, who was very patient with me. I came in wanting to look at a car out of my price range but was insistent on not going above $12,000. He was very understanding of the dilemma and did his best to find the right car for me. There were a few other ""must-haves"" that he was able to work with to find me something I look forward to driving every day. For each car he showed me, he took time to explain its specs, even lifting the hood and telling me about the engine technology I would be investing in. I would rate him 5+ stars!

However, I have rated the dealership itself 4 stars, because I was dissatisfied with my experience with their financing department. Adam Bekkali did not give me my complete paperwork. When I left the dealership, I was missing several documents. (I did not find out until later that I was missing them.) I went back the next day to get a copy of a paper I had signed the night before but he couldn't find it and had to print a new one. He also could not explain why the cash price on the paperwork was $400 more than the price quoted (on paper!) to me by the salesman. Adam told me that the question would have to be taken up with the accounting department because ""these forms are very complicated."" Yes, I sure they are very complicated. But if you can't fully explain a paper you want someone to sign, then you shouldn't be asking them to sign it. As a young female first-time car buyer, I was worried that my inexperience with cars and car-buying would be taken advantage of. That may have never been his intent, but I still left the dealership feeling uncomfortable with the paperwork I had just signed. I will be refinancing my loan through someone else and canceling the warranties and insurance I purchased from Adam.",4.4

165,"February 06, 2016","I went in on January 18th looking for a used car under $13,000. This was the beginning of the worst and best car experience, I've experienced a few other car sales through my family, but this one started pretty bad but persistence and simple communication got me in the car that I wanted, for far lower price than I expected.
The whole experience started with them showing me an older 2013 Camry SE in very poor condition. Bumpers clips were snapped off, there were several scuffs on the body, and a multitude of other issues, the next two  cars were a mirror image of this car. Before heading back I noticed 2 very clean and good condition Toyotas.
The second card was a 2013 Corolla S, which had it's share of problems. Also a no go.
Last car was a car that was over my budget but claimed they’d work on the price. Salesman said manager would work on the price.
The third and final car that pissed me off was a 2014 Camry SE, from afar it looked promising but once I started getting closer I spotted all the details: Same bumper loose on the side, clips were broken. Several scuffs. Trim was bent, and lastly fog light was missing. Plastics were missing from the inside, and a few other issues. 58k miles on a 2014 car.
Once we went in I explained I didn't like any of the cars. They made a very dumb mistake confusing me with another customer and giving me someone else’s car offer paper to me. After a pricing mistake, and trying to shaft me with 3 cars not fit for sale imho, I was getting upset. This was all coming from the first Sales manager. The dude was looking to screw someone over.
I sent them an insulting offer for the 2014 camry they showed me. I explained to him I was pretty upset, that I'd been shown 3 different cars, all of them were in my opinion not fit for sale. I'd been to a lot of dealers including Toyota dealers, KIA, Honda, BMW, Ford, Mazda, and a few others. None had shown me cars as messed up as the ones they showed me. I explained if they seriously didn't have anything, why try to pass off a damaged vehicle?
The sales manager, whos name I believe was Kevin explained that he was sorry for the experience. He asked me what I was looking for, getting up and leaving would really not resolve anything and he was willing to listen to what I want and would give me options. That’s when the salesman JR let him know there was 2 cars I had eyed and liked in the beginning. A 2014 Corolla, and 2014 Camry. Kevin asked which I would be interested in, I said the Camry. Based on my experience driving them, they were quieter and smoother rides. I explained that I had a budget, and I wouldn't be able to do 17k. He simply said not to worry about it. He asked the salesman to pull the car up front, and for me to check the car. If I liked it, He'd shoot me his lowest offer.
I looked at it, and found it to my liking. Car was Certified preowned, good tires, and had 26k miles Very minimal paint damage, mostly minor stuff that can be covered up easily. No need to have paint repaired. Bumpers/panels were all lined up. I told the salesman I'd like to hear the numbers; I was definitely liking the car. The offer I received was 15k+TTL. I took the deal.

Now after taking the car, we had to renegotiate the deal because no bank wanted to loan me the money at the interest rate they spotted me at 7.2%, I was shown all the requests and denials from the banks. A total of 9 denials, 4 unknowns, and some acceptance but at double the interest rate. They tried to put me at 14% interest, however I denied it. At this point I was ready to just give the car back and head to KIA for another vehicle I had seen and loved.
Omar my FI guy talked to his manager. They figured out a way to get a loan by dropping the price of the car by $1700~. How ever they'd fill the gap with extended warranty, and a few other add-on packages.
They worked with me despite having no real reason to do so because of my credit score, and lack of credit history. I appreciate they went above and beyond to rectify a bad experience, and made it into a good one. Omar, JR and Kevin were outstanding.
Not only did they find me financing but they got me financing through Toyota Financial, which is great for the next time I buy a car.

UPDATE 2/11/2016
Received paperwork for CPO. It seems I was lied into getting 5k+ of worthless addons, lied about the CPO warranty/coverage and apparently they may gone against truth in Lending act.
I can no longer recommend this dealer. It seems through and through they just lie to get the sale done.
I would have never agreed to the purchase with the excessive addons if I knew CPO was 7 years 100k miles and 12k 1 year comprehensive warranty. I was told it was only 60k miles, and only had 6k remaining of the warranty.

When my husband and I first got to the dealership, somebody greeted us before we even came in. His name was Suprem Francis. We told him we saw the car online and he knew exactly what car we were talking about and seemed very knowledgeable. Whenever I first looked at the car I wasn't sure about it. The financial adviser, Omar, stepped in and was willing to do anything to ""make me smile."" Another salesman, Mike Atakpo, also came into the situation. They were all brainstorming to figure out what the best vehicle would be for me to get. At that point, I was pretty open-minded about the type of car. They must have pulled 5 cars for me to look at. The Hyundai was really growing on me at that point. I had left the dealership to shop around, but I kept coming back to the Hyundai at this dealership. I came back and negotiated the price and we came to an agreement and I got their Platinum Warranty which was really excellent because it was through their dealership and not through a third party. Kamil Nasrawi, the manager, was also very helpful throughout the process. I felt extremely happy that this group of people were so willing to help me to find the perfect car.

I bought several new cars in the past, never had a first class service like this. Sewell's sale reps needs to learn from this guys.

Craig(Greg), has US Navy medallions on his desk, the finance person, did an excellent job as well, got us good interest rates and we bought a warrantee package, an investment, that I know Toyota Grapevine will stand behind when I have car problems.

Please recognize your employees hard work, the relationships they build with clients, goes much further than any marketing dollars invested. We reside an hour away from Toyota at Grapevine, and had research other dealer ship in the area. If I had to buy a Toyota again, it will be at Toyota at Grapevine.

However, we found another car at a different dealership that we preferred. We called the salesman (Sergio) to give him the news; however, Texas Toyota of Grapevine ran our check anyway. We called to let them know that they should have not done that and they ran it through a second time. This cost us NFS fees. We talked to the bank and asked us whether we were dealing with UTA and we said Toyota of Grapevine. The second time the  check was run, it was not our check anymore but a facsimile of our check, therefore, the bank turned the case to their fraud department. Then we were contacted by a collection agency who demanded payment on the check. Finally the state of Texas has issued us a title to the car we never purchased.

177,"November 18, 2015","My husband and I filed for bankruptcy in September of 2014.  I was driving a 1997 Pontiac Grand Am that obviously had seen better days and was no longer reliable.  We were kind of in a tough spot, as far as being able to obtain financing.  We had approval from the court to incur debt, and our sales guy quickly got us approved for a 2013 Corolla.  The day we purchased the car (October 23, 2015), it was pouring down rain, so we did not get to do a very good inspection of the outside - our fault.  Not once did the dealership offer to pull the car into the service area so we could do a good inspection of the outside - their fault.  The car has multiple scratches on the hood and the trunk.  We did review the Carfax, which indicated a collision on the BACK LEFT WITH NO DAMAGE.

About a week after getting the vehicle home, I noticed that the front passenger headlight had condensation in it.  I made an appointment with the service department (November 14, 2015).  We still have about 3,000 left on the factory warranty.  As long as the vehicle hadn't been wrecked, we'd be fine.  Guess what - the front end of the vehicle has been wrecked. And it's pretty obvious once you look.  Under the hood, there is no hood insulator.  There is no EPA sticker (is this even legal?).  The hood, front bumper and passenger headlight have all been replaced.  We spoke to the Used Car Manager.  His response?  ""According to the Carfax, we have no knowledge of the car being wrecked in the front.  If you are not happy, we would gladly take the vehicle back from you.""  What a guy.

I get that a dealership goes by the Carfax.  I get that I bought the car ""As Is.""  But come on.  You cannot honestly expect me to believe that the service department looked over this vehicle and did not realize it had been wrecked.  If this is true, I would NEVER take my car here to be serviced.

Bottom line, I feel like the dealership knew that we were desperate for a vehicle and we were taken advantage of.  They must have laughed at what suckers we were, when we drove off that night.  I really wish we were buying a car because we wanted one, not because we needed one.

Hey, Texas Toyota, a little acknowledgement goes a long way.  Brushing off customers because you don't ""have"" to do anything speaks volumes about the way you feel about us.  It doesn't bring repeat customers.

184,"August 25, 2015","I was at Texas Toyota 3 times in the first 3 months of owning a new Rav4.  The first time seemed to take care of the issue and I didn’t have another problem for over 2,000 miles.  I had the car towed in mid-June when I pulled out of my garage and the car stopped working. It wouldn’t start for me, the tow truck driver or the mechanic.  They didn’t know what was wrong so they put me in a rental car for the weekend.  I was told the car was fixed on Monday afternoon, picked it up on Tuesday morning and on Thursday my car broke down again. It hesitated twice on me while driving on the highway to work and then stalled repeatedly in the parking lot as I was leaving work.  I had to wait 3 hours for a tow truck through Roadside assistance.  

Robert, the service advisor, was very nice--at first.  When the car came in for the 2nd time, they couldn't recreate the issue so he tried to blame LoJack and basically get rid of me.  He had no idea how LoJack worked -- asking me if someone knew my LoJack code and could have shut the car off.  That's not how LoJack works at all.  He was going to make me turn in the rental car in and drive an unsafe vehicle that could have broken down at any point in time.  

He only backed off when Toyota Corporate got involved; then let me keep the car through the weekend.  They finally 'think' they solved the issue the following Monday.  He left a voicemail that the mechanic 'really thinks this fixed the issue' and acted insulted when I was hesitant to pick the car up due to the repeated safety issues.  I never received an apology for not fixing the problem the first time. Even when Jennifer with Customer Relations emailed to ask how things were going and I told her of my issues – she didn’t even offer a fake apology.  Absolutely no integrity or commitment to safety—just another sleazy dealership.

I did all my research in advance, knew what I was willing to pay (a fair price) and even identified a couple of vehicles advertised on the dealership website.   I let the internet salesperson know up front what my budget was and what I wanted.  He kept trying to get me to come into the dealership, promising he could work with my budget.  I know the goal is to get the potential customer on-site, so I insisted on getting a price first.  He told me he could work with my price, that he wasn't going to lose my business over a few hundred dollars, etc.  Finally we got to an agreed price and I asked him to send me the worksheet showing the final amount and I would come in and buy the car.  Then he claimed a ""miscommunication"" and jacked the price up about $1,200.  His manager stepped in but didn't help.  The salesperson then sent me condescending emails, even calling me ""my dear!""  I went to Toyota of Plano and bought the identical car, with added features, for my budgeted amount -- all in a single day.  I would not recommend Toyota of Grapevine.",1.4

David was a Godsend.  He is very calm, you get none of the stereotypical ""car salesman"" behavior from him.  Don't let the calm nature fool you though, he is a real go getter and he worked very hard to get us into our car.  We told him our max budget and he delivered at that.  He did that with us having serious credit issues and a limited budget and very small down payment.1  David also has excellent listening skills.  He not once spoke over us and he paid attention to everything we said as evidenced by him thoroughly listing our needs, wants and even fears when it came to purchasing a car on a very tight budget with far less than stellar credit.  I cannot stress enough how hard he worked on the financing of our new car.  Johnny in finance was also a huge blessing.  He worked magic with the banks to get us into our car.  His desk was buzzing with people but he treated our case like top priority.  Dru did the finalization of our paperwork, warranties etc and he also was very patient and helpful.  He got us a great rate on a nice warranty and gap insurance (always get gap insurance!!!).  All 3 gentleman who assisted us today were first rate.  I know our Toyota will last us many years but you'd better believe that when we do buy another vehicle we will go back to Texas Toyota of Grapevine.

It seemed like the battery was dying (clicking sounds), but would still start part of the time.  I had it towed using Toyota Roadside assistance to Toyota of Plano.  The service advisor was genuinely disinterested in providing any level of customer service.  They said they tested everything and everything was fine.  They said I shouldn’t have that issue again and it was probably just a fluke with a new car.

After I left Toyota of Plano I stopped for gas on the way home and had the same issue.  I called the Toyota Cares corporate number to complain.  The Director of Ops from Toyota of Plano called shortly after and provided no useful information and accepted no responsibility.  I took the car to Toyota of Grapevine and they said they didn’t know why Toyota of Plano didn’t replace the battery.  The service advisor, Allen, was wonderful.  He was committed to making sure my car worked properly and told me to call if I had anymore issues and they would figure it out.  Such a change from the advisor at Toyota of Plano who could've cared less.  They replaced the battery and I haven’t had any issues for the past 2 weeks.

What I thought was a typical passive salesman was ALL WRONG! Vincent was really great. He was honest and up front and put me at ease by answering all my questions. He understood my needs and didn't try and pull the wool over my eyes at all.

Compared to other dealership experiences where I was treated horribly and passed off and dismissed without a second thought), Vincent was a breath of fresh air. The whole staff, really. I was greeted and welcome and wasn't treated like just another sale. It's important to me to feel like a person rather than a dollar sign.

He did his best to get me something fair - Vince is a true gem. He is a kind and patient and generous person. He is well liked by his coworkers (I saw this first hand), and works really hard for his clients. I can honestly say he worked for me. 

My final decision came down to what made the most sense financially, what was the best fit for me, and the ease of buying after making that decision.

225,"May 29, 2014","The dealership,  from the outside is beautiful, but when you enter the ""showroom"", there are only ""two"" so not really a showroom to speak of and the vehicle we were looking for wasn't one of the two.  No problem, we went out to the lot. We were evaluating several different models and the salesperson had to keep running back into the dealership trying to locate keys and move cars around.    It look about 90 mins to test drive 3 vehicles ---- really a waste of time.  If it were raining or 90+ degrees, would not be looking at cars here.  

Anyway, the salesperson was doing a good job considering being hindered in showing the vehicles and we actually felt sorry for him.  One time he had to go back into the dealership from a distance in the lot several times trying to locate keys and was told incorrect information and could not find the right keys.  Upon completing the test drives he escorted us back into the dealership as we were going to see if they could locate the vehicle with the features we were looking for.  That's when the experience began to shift and really go downhill.  

First of all, they sit you on these bistro tables in the middle of the floor surrounded by other tables and people.  Absolutely no sense of privacy whatsoever in discussing these details ... and let's face it, when you get down to business and price, you want a little privacy and an area away from distractions.

First the business manager strolled by and introduced himself and shook hands.  Then he disappeared.  Then the sales person left to check their computers to see if he could locate our vehicle and then the business manager returned with the paperwork and tried getting down to closing the deal.  It was practically at full price plus they had added in a warranty at DOUBLE the price.. about $1500 MORE than what the warranty normally costs.  Guess he thought we wouldn't notice.  Then the salesperson reappeared and the business manager eventually disappeared.   By no means was this happening quickly... seemed like 5-10 mins would pass each time one would appear or disappear or we would be left sitting by ourselves.  I'm sure a sales ""technique"" --- which really wasn't appreciated.

Well, we had done some homework on the internet in looking at prices, so we discussed this with the salesperson and also mentioned that we would be buying a car this week, but not today, because this was the first place we had stepped into.  So the salesperson left again to try and locate the vehicle with our options, or so we thought.  But this seems to be a well-orchestrated sales dance as in comes character number 3, the sales manager.  This person sits down and starts going over the car details and he hadn't even the courtesy to introduce himself or who he was.  More pressure and then the salesperson reappears.   The SM looked at the numbers and said we qualified for a group rate and came back with another quote that was about $2000 less... but the extended warranty (which we didn't want) was still included in the quote.  So they came down on price, but made up for it in the over-priced warranty.  Not such a ""good deal"".    

We finally left the dealership after being there for several hours completely worn out and with not such a good feeling from being tossed around from manager to manager --- very unprofessional sales environment.  Which was a shame for the sales person, but if it were just him, we would've purchased from that dealership.

We went to another dealership the next day that had good reviews on Dealerrater and bought a new Toyota.  No pressure, key boxes on all the car windows so you could easily and quickly access the vehicles (without wasting time), dealt with the salesperson up until the very end and that was fine when the sales manager, who introduced himself, and was low pressure came in to seal the deal.

230,"April 08, 2014","I would rate Toyota of Grapevine zero stars.

Yesterday, I was online looking for a car. With poor credit, due to a lost job 18 months ago and hospital bills due to a heart issue, I knew that buying a car (I was looking at a used car) would be tough, but I make over 6 figures in income, and I knew dealers would overlook bad credit with good income.

I filled out a short application online, and then get a call from Toyota of Grapevine. I told the salesperson that I had the worst credit possible, due to a medical issues and previous lost job, and that I have no car now (as our car broke down) and that I did not want to walk to a dealer or catch a taxi if I did not know before hand that I was approved for a loan and car purchase. The sales person had me fill out an application online at their website. He called me back and said that I was approved of a loan, as long as I could put down $2,000.

I catch a partial ride to the dealer and walk the remaining 3 miles.

When I get there, the same guy I spoke with online and who said I was approved asks me to fill out a paper application, as he says it is protocol that EVERYONE must fill out a paper application even if they filled out one online. Then he comes back, after speaking with his manager and says that if I can put down $4,000 in the next month, he can get me a car. I agreed and said I could get $4,000 in 28 days. Then he comes back and says that if I get $4,000 in 21 days, he will get me a car. He already knew I could not get it in 21 days, so, basically he and his manager tried to set a down payment that would force me not to be able to get the car. 

#1 The salesperson lied that I was approved for a loan at the $2,000 down payment to get me to the site. #2, I walked 3 miles to get their. These people lied directly to me. DO NOT FILL OUT AN APPLICATION ONLINE FOR THEM AND IF THEY KEEP JACKING UP THE DOWN PAYMENT, IT IS THEIR WAY OF PRICING YOU OUT OF BUYING A CAR THERE SO THEY CAN AVOID SAYING NO TO YOU.. These people are lying and they know it, but cover it up with changing down payment amounts. For someone with a heart condition and someone that is COMPLETELY honest with the dealer before even coming in, this was outrageously deceitful and caused me great frustration. Liars. Do not shop here!!!

239,"July 19, 2013","I had a horrible experience with Texas Toyota of Grapevine. I was trying to decide between the Honda Insight and the Toyota Prius and found a great deal on the dealership website for a 2010 prius. I called on Saturday 7/13/13 and was told that the car was currently in the shop being inspected so i couldn't come see it that day but made an appointment to come see it on Monday evening. I received a call on Monday about an hour before my appointment saying that the car was unfortunately still in the shop so I wouldn't be able to see it but was promised that it would be available the next day no matter what. I drove about 30 minutes in the pouring rain to the dealership the next day to go see the Prius. I didn't want to test drive it in the rain so the sales associate drove around in the parking lot a few times and explained the car features. We then went back inside the dealership where he asked his sales manager to come talk to us about the price. He informed us the price of the car we'd just seen was $19000 and it had no warranty. The car I'd seen online was $13000. I told the sales manager that that wasn't the car I'd come to see and he told me ""you called on saturday. today is tuesday. of course there was the possibility of the car being sold during that time"". How could the car have been sold during that time if every time I'd tried to come in and see it, I'd been told it was in the shop for inspection? The manager absolutely no mention of an apology. Throughout this entire process, I'd repeatedly asked the sales associate I'd been in contact with to make sure that the car I was coming to see was indeed the car that had been listed online and he'd assured me multiple times that it was. Apparently none of that mattered once we were actually there. 5 minutes after leaving the dealership, I received a call from the sales associate apologizing for the situation and saying that if we came back in, they would match the price of the car we'd just seen to the car I'd seen online... but only if we bought it tonight because the deal expires at midnight. Even if they had indeed matched the price if we went back in, which i suspect they would not have after reading the other reviews for this place on Yelp, I would never purchase a car from a dealership who does this kind of stuff. This was the worst experience I've ever had at a car dealership and was obviously just way for them bring people in to the dealership and then treat them horribly once they're actually there. We went the same night to the Honda dealership and bought the certified Insight for a much smaller price. I've driven a Corolla for years and never had any problems with it but the service at this particular dealership was absolutely terrible.",1.0
240,"July 07, 2013","

This Toyota Grapevine dealership will go to great lengths to deceive the customer into purchasing their car. The buying experience is repulsive. Do not go to this location to buy a Toyota. The manipulation by the sales representative Francisco Ovalle and sale manager Milton Cordero are not worth it. 
On Saturday May 25th, 2013,  my family and I went to this location to test-drive the Toyota Prius. Francisco showed it to us, and we liked the car enough to consider discussion on a price.  However, at the table, he let us in on a little ""secret."" He told us  Camry Hybrid   had better price were given a $5000 rebate. He told us no other dealership could offer that much  rebate. He could offer us $22,000 for sale price. We said since we hadn't intended to purchase the Camry Hybrid at the beginning we needed to think about it. 

Later that night, we received a call from Francisco to let us know that they could  offer us $21,000 , which the manager had approved early.  We thought it was a great deal. We rushed to the dealership again, ready to drive home the new car that day. On the agreement, Francisco wrote to agree final sale price  for $21,000 . He had us sign the sheet and give him an unsigned blank check. Then came Milton Cordero , the on duty manager. He sat down, turned on his business charm by attempting to connect with. However, very quickly the mood changed when he said in an exasperated manner that this is a Hybrid. How in the world could we reach the $21,000 mark? He said the $5000 rebate did not exist for the Camry Hybrid. He wanted to show us invoice and renegotiate the price.  We told him : ""No"" .
We were deceived for the entire day, right from the start when Francisco told us this lie. We would not have even considered this car at first without the sure fact that this $5000 rebate on the Camry Hybrid existed. Francisco even said from the start that this was ""advertised on their website,"" making this official.  We told Milton that  $21,000 had approved by the manager according to Francisco's words. , otherwise we wouldn't to come that later to buy a car. We had signed on paper for an agreement for $21,000 and submitted a signed check. The dealership did not honor their word, saying that the $21,000 was merely a ""proposal,""  . Milton  reneged this offer and the rebate. In a very confrontational manner, he told us they did not want our business and asked us to remove ourselves from his dealership. There was no apology for lying to us about the rebate. 
The business strategies to lure us into considering the car was absolutely abhorrent. This dealership will ruin the car buying experience for you. I would highly recommend that you find another location to purchase a Toyota, a great car brand that should not be subjected to this terrible business tactic.

242,"June 02, 2013","UPDATE!!  This dealer experience gets even better. I purchased a warranty on this vehicle. Took the car to the Mini Dealer in Plano and they gave me a list of 7 items that needed to be repaired on my just purchased Mini cooper. They contacted the warranty company and they said ""we will take this under review as to whether it will be covered since this car was just purchased from a dealer. We feel that this work should have been done by the selling dealer before the sale."" The total bill was over $850! These guys are a bunch of crooks! Do not purchase a used car from these guys!

I purchased a 2007 Mini cooper with low miles (price in range of $11,300, plus warranty).  Within three days lights came on in the car.  Took it in for service.  In five days from sale a check engine light came on.  I spoke with Finance Manager who told me to bring it back in and we could trade for another car.  What this basically involved was reappraising the Mini cooper with a trade in value (not what I paid).  I selected a car that I saw online for a price of $13,888.  They worked up the price which basically looked like this:  Price of the car $18,888 (give or take a few hundred and not the internet posted value).  My trade in value was $8,000.  No credit for any money I paid originally (not in the price of the car, not in my trade in value, nor in cash).  They wanted to finance me with a loan rate of 12% for 6 years, (which doubled my payments), where my original finance rate was 6.5% for 48.  To say the least, they intended to make much more than $4,000 on this great and generous deal that they were going to do for my unfortunate experience.   
The Finance manager said they check out every vehicle they sell.  Truth is, they can't do any repairs on a Mini Cooper.  They farm repairs and tuning to the local BMW dealer.  All they did was put on new tires and change the oil and air filters.  So much for testing out the used vehicle, like they claimed.
While these guys were very friendly, I would definitely think twice about buying from them.  The don't stand behind their used autos. They jack up their price to suit their mood at the moment.  DEFINITELY, SHOP WITH INTERNET PRICES AND CHECK OUT THE BLUE BOOK VALUE BEFORE YOU GO TO ANY DEALER.  Fortunately, I knew enough to walk away from this scam.  Perhaps their behavior had alot to do with the fact I was a woman.  After all we women do get ripped when getting car repairs and in buying cars.  NOT THIS LADY THOUGH!

I have no problem recommending checking out their inventory and working a deal with him.

I particularly appreciated that the Service Department also did a thorough assessment of the entire vehicle and that Greg promptly emailed me a detailed report of their findings and recommendations.  That made it easy for me to identify which of the additional problems I felt I could handle myself and which I wanted the Service Department to handle.  

In discussing the additional problem items noted in the report, Greg was very respectful of my decisions about which items I wanted to handle myself and which I wanted the Service Department to address and he provided very useful additional information and perspective about which of the items required immediate attention, which could be postponed, and what alternatives might exist to more economically address some of the issues.  

This constructive and very collaborative approach is a ""Breath of Fresh Air"" in the auto service industry and engenders immense trust and confidence that makes me look forward to bringing my vehicle back to Texas Toyota for any service issues whatsoever.

279,"August 18, 2012","Absolutely the worst car purchasing experience I've ever had, or can imagine for that matter. .........
A Prius was my choice and after looking at Robbins Toyota I had to leave Texarkana  to work in Dallas for a week. hoping to get the best deal possible I stopped by Texas Toyota at Grapevine.  Doug Holmes, the sales manager and I  continued to text each other discussing the car deal even after I returned home to Texarkana. Doug sent me a text pic of the invoice and his final offer including 13500 for my trade.  Since Texas Toyota offered me 500 more for my 2008 Honda CR-V and a fixed finance amount on a Prius 4 after trade of  14,300 as apposed to 14,500 at the Texarkana dealership for a Prius 3 with added leather package, I decided it was worth the extra 200 to drive to Dallas and purchase the Prius 4. Doug tried to get me to send him a cash fax of $500 to hold it until I could get to Dallas and I am so glad I didn't. I was afraid to do that especially since I had read several bad reviews about the dealership, so I stalled  a few days trying to decide what to do. By Wednesday I called and asked if thecar was still there and if he would still honor the deal we had agreed upon as written up on the invoice he had sent me.  He said the car was there and to come and get it. I told him I was coming after work that day and couldn't leave till 4:30 pm.. I texted to let him know that I was leaving Texarkana and then again when I got into the Dallas area. When I arrived another salesman began to get the deal rolling. After waiting over an hour he comes in and asks me to tell him one more time what the agreement was. I reminded him. After another hour he comes to me with some paperwork and says ""you are not going to like this""..and tells me that there had been a mistake - they could not possibly give me 13,500 for my trade, that my car was only worth 9000. He showed me a paper where teh appraiser had written down 15000 miles instead of 115000 and used that as the reason to renig on the original deal. He said he worked hard and got them to give me 10,000 but that was as good as they could do.  I became irrate and he eventually called a financial manager out to talk to me who tried to discredit me by saying noone had appraised my car when I was there before - I told him that they had taken my car in the shop and came back telling me they could give me 13500. He said it was not appraised - I guess he though I had made it up. I I was so upset I forgot the other man had just shown me the appraisal paper a few minutes before. (By the way, the NADA for my car that I looked up online with the 115000 miles was in line with what he offered me) - where did the 9000 come from all the sudden? My friend and I had taken off work early (vacation time) and driven all that way just to find out we had been lied to. I asked to talk to Doug the original salesman and was informed he was not available. Funny, he had been answering my texted day and night the last week - no problem getting him then. I told this manager that I guess I was partially at fault for trusting them after reading the reviews and blogs, and he proceded to tell me they had new ownership and managers and didn't do business that way anymore. I told him I begged to dissagree after this experience. 
I have never been so humiliated and left totally disallusioned with the dealership. Fortunately,  for Toyota Corporation, I did not take this experience out on them but  returned to Robbins Toyota in Texarkana and they honored the price they had given me previously (including 13000 for my trade). I still get mad when I think of Texas Toyota telling me my car wasn't worth more than 9000. Texas Toyota at Grapevine gives a good company a bad name. They are shysters, cheating honest individuals! I was offered gas money for my trouble? i wonder what price they will eventually pay for the lame promises they make? Honoring their original promise would have cost them less in the long run. 
I know those guys were laughing as we lrft, smug in the thought that they had gotten the best of me, but I don't think they will be laughing for long. 
I truly believe Toyato to be a World Class Corporation and that Toyota would be very unhappy to be represented by Texas Toyota at Grapevine if they knew the shenanegans going on there.  Hopefully Toyota Corp will hold this dealership accountable. They know that the number of sales obtained by these unethical means will not outway the negative repercussions as a result of their unethical business practices. They truly live up to the ""car salesman"" image - anything to make a sale. 
My friend left Hampton, Ar and we left Texarkana at 4:30 for Grapevine, arriving there at 7:30 pm. We left the dealership at approx 10:00 pm not getting home till after midnight. You offered us compensation - at per diem rate you owe me $387 just for gas. That's not counting the 2 hours Robin took of vac to leave work early enough to get here to ride with me. I took 4 hours of vacation time in order to leave early enough to get there prior to closing. Robin traveled 100 miles to Texarkana and we traveled an additional 198 miles to the dealership. I figure the dallas per diem rate of .65/mile for the 298 miles one way times 2 (596 round trip) to come up with the $398 and that's not counting the 6 hours of vacation or the drive time of another 7 hours.  I want restoration or I'll post this on every review I can find and the BBB as well. Texas Toyota will not change until they are held accountable for their actions. I apologize to anyone this might offend that isn't unethical working at thte dealership  but am sorry for you for working at a company that allows such actions. ",1.4

I was assured by Britney (Internet Sales) they had the specific car on the lot for me to see.  I drove from far West Fort Worth (70 miles round trip) to see the car.  On arrival, I was informed not only did the not have the car on the lot but they were unsure when one like it may arrive.  They did however have a large number of upgraded models they would like for me to see.  This dealership intentionally misled me and misrepresented themselves just to get me on the lot with disregard for my time and inconvenience.  I spoke with the sales representative J.P Penaflor and New Car Director Andry Korneev about my concerns around the lack of integrity demonstrated by the dealership.  Both failed to listen to my concerns and continued with their sales talking points about other models.  I explained that I had no interest in dealing this an organization of this caliber but they could focus on nothing but getting a sale back on track.

On the way home, I spoke with dealerships in Denton, Fort Worth, and Weatherford Texas who were quick to say they did not have the car requested in stock but would be glad to give me a call when they do.  That was all I was asking and what I believe to be a reasonable expectation.   

Texas Toyota of Grapevine failed to display integrity, listen the consumer, or meet minimal expectations.  I believe the staff and leadership of Texas Toyota of Grapevine Toyota needs to revisit the new rules of marketing in which consumers demand relationships built on trust, transparency, mutual respect and most importantly word-of mouth peer reviews.  Texas Toyota of Grapevine failed on all of these attributes therefore I strongly recommend exploring the other alternative dealerships within the DFW area.                        ",1.0
294,"October 29, 2011","Excellent Customer Service Professionals is the only way to describe Corey McLeRoy, Tisha Henderson and Sean Loftice. Each of them contributed to making my new car buying experience the easiest I've ever had.

October 18 I called giving Corey, New Car Desk Manager, the following specifics: I wanted a 2011 Camry XLE, either silver or white with leather interior. Plus I wanted to take advantage of the 0% financing and provided him with my down payment amount and my monthly payment range.  In just a few minutes Corey confirmed they had a 2011 Camry XLE, white with bisque leather interior and sunroof, and provided me with the monthly payment amount which was within my payment range!!

October 19 I arrived at Texas Toyota of Grapevine where Tisha Henderson, Sales Associate, walked out to greet me.  I provided her with the information Corey had provided me, she took it to Andre Korneev, New Car Sales Director.  In no time Tisha brought Andre to meet me and Andre confirmed the price/payments Corey had provided.  Tisha and I went on a demo drive, then came back and started the paperwork. Very shortly I was in the office of Sean Loftice, Finance Manager, where I signed off on all the legal documents. During the time I was in Sean's office, Tisha contacted the car rental office and had them pick up my rental car. Additionally, she had sent my new car through make-ready and I was able to drive my Camry home within just a few hours from entering the dealership.  Before walking me to my new car, being the great customer service professional she is, Tisha took me around the dealership and introduced me to Greg Stubbs, Assistant Service Manager, and Wendy Wilson, Customer Relations Manager.

Without any doubt, I am extremely satisfied with all of the individuals I had interaction with at Texas Toyota of Grapevine, and I am definitely sharing this experience with all my family and friends.

There is one question; couldn’t any dealership do the same?  Obviously NOT because I contacted 5 other dealerships, including Toyota and Nissan, within the Denton, Lewisville and Arlington area, where all I got was the run-around.  Not one other was able to provide price/payment as Corey had done.  Not one other was able to confirm they had a 2011 Camry XLE like I was requesting.  Not one other offered to pull the car of my request from another dealership….NO, NO, NO, they would only tried to convince me to come into their dealership because they had a “ great deal” on a 2012 Camry LE or a 2011 Camry SE, etc.

I conclude that Texas Toyota of Grapevine should be ranked No. 1, because it takes great management to hire and keep great professionals like Corey, Tisha and Sean.

Kudos to Texas Toyota of Grapevine and their team!

n. a dishonest sales practice in which a business advertises a bargain price for an item in order to draw customers into the store and then tells the prospective buyer that the advertised item is of poor quality or no longer available and attempts to switch the customer to a more expensive product.

I even had a co-signer verified income and a down payment worked out. I thought that once you signed you drive with no more interaction with the dealership. Don't get me wrong, the price on the car was good for what it was and they seem to be VERY friendly but, wait til you have to return the car. Once the car back on their lot they treating me as if I was invisible and then gave me the run around on getting my trade back. No more ""let me find out or how can I help you get this taken care of"". All the pleasantries went out the window with the car. At first I was looking forward to having a Toyota but I now I have lost my taste for one from anyone. This is all the more reason to buy American.

This dealer had a listing on craigslist for an x5 and it said call for pricing.  So, I did.  I asked about the car and sarah was very nice and helpful.  She asked me what price I needed and I told her I had to stay under 12k.  She size let me call over to check with the preowned manager to make sue that is something they can work with and she said she would call me back.  Just as she said, about 5 minutes later she called back and said that the preowned manager said he could work with 12k.  So I set up an appointment to view it the next day.  I was so anxious that I convinced my fiance to drive from Denton to grapevine knowing we would hit rush hour traffic to see the car today.  We get there and everyone is really nice at first.  They didn't have a white x5 as sarah and I had discussed on the phone and they did have a grey one that was an 03 but wouldn't go less that $15.5k for.  I was livid.  I felt lied to and treated poorly.

I was told I could take more discount off the vehicle. I then called to see if I could come see the Ford Escape. Shardae advised me to ask for Anna. I drove the whole hour there and got stuck in construction traffic. The place felt sleazy. The first guy out of the sales room kept asking too many questions. I was ready to tell him none of his business, I wanted to talk to who I asked for, Anna. Then once they finally got their heads out from downstairs, Anna finally appeared from new cars. I assume she had no idea that I was going to be there to ask for her. Good communication Shardae...
""Bringing the car around"" took forever and then Anna finally came inside to tell me that they sold that vehicle yesterday. I was floored. Then they asked if I wanted to see another Escape. I said, ""well, I'm here and you already pissed me off...""  It was black, with black leather with 3x the amount of miles on it of the Escape I originally came to see. I told them they are nuts and they kept trying to sell me other vehicles. Why? If I came in to see one particular SUV, why does it seem that I would change my mind? Then she took me inside to talk to some sleazy guy with a fake smile and fake eyes. He asked me, ""can I sell you a Toyota Rav 4?""  I said, ""NO, Only an Escape."" They walked outside and then came back in to ask if he could sell me a Honda Accord. Not only did I say no to the other SUV, now the moron was trying to sell me a CAR!!

316,"April 16, 2011","Please, please, please do not go to this dealership and read this post in full before considering. We had the worst car buying experience of our lives. We worked with Will and Ryan and quickly came to a deal on a used SUV. Part of the deal we agreed to was installing a sunroof. We were told it would take one day an it took 4. Once we got it back it looked absolutely horrible. The button was tilted and just randomly thrown on the ceiling and the entire ceiling was bumpy with fabric hanging. They told me that nothing could be done. Once we had the car for like a week we realized the ipod jack didnt work and the gas tank sprayed gas everytime you filled it up. Luckily (we thought) we had spent the extra $2500 for the warranty! We got the car assessed with the help of Freddie and it needed a whole new radio and gas tank. You guess it, the warranty didnt cover it even though we had specifically asked Mel (person who sold us the warranty) and he assured us over and over that pretty much everything was covered under this warranty. We had a car that physically looked horrible because of the hanging fabric from the sunroof and was also now a safety hazard because of the faulty gas tank. I called to cancel the warranty- since it was useless- and would not get a call back for weeks after probably 15 phone calls and 8 messages. I literally one night had to sit on the phone and call the poor receptionist over and over and over until she paged him for me just to tell him to please cancel my warranty. The thing is that everyone seems so nice and when a problem arose everyone always said ""we will fix this and take care of it"" but literally nothing got fixed. Ryan said we will try to fix the sunroof, Mel said we will fix the warranty, Freddie said we will see if we can get the gas tank fixed and literally NOTHING happened. We would just never hear back from anyone. If we called any of them we wouldnt get an answer and never get a call back. In the end we traded the car in at Don Davis Nissan of Arlington and had a WONDERFUL experience. We lost $3k on the trade-in but didnt have a choice because of the lack of help from Texas Toyota of Grapevine and the fact the the car was sold to us with a safety hazard. I am begging you to please reconsider going to this dealership. We are good people with normal expectations and this dealership failed miserably. Do not waste your time. They will seem nice but if anything goes wrong I warn you that NOTHING at all will get fixed and NO ONE will help you. I promise. Please do not put yourself through the headache. We greatly regret ever stepping foot on that lot. ",1.0
317,"March 12, 2011","BBB rating is F, and it is a valid rating.  I spoke with Alex on the phone regarding a used car. Yes, it was still available, and she quoted me a price of $9,995. It was also listed on Ebay Motors for $10,500 and the Texas Toyota of Grapevine website with an internet price of $9,995. After spending more than an hour at the dealership, the sales manager presents me with the price of $13,988. Alex was ""unavailable"" to explain. But the salesman said the price was $9,995 plus ""shop charges"". This is a price way above market value for this car, and I would not have spent two hours driving to their location if they had quoted that price over the phone. When I got home, they had scrubbed the internet of all traces of this car. It had been completely removed from various auto sales websites, and the price on the Texas Toyota of Grapevine site had been changed to ""Call for quote"".  The next day they call and want to sell me the car for $9,995, saying they made a mistake.  After 2+ hours of telephone conversations, they tell me they can't sell me the car because it has ""frame damage"".  But wait...  they have a similar car for $16,900!  Classic ""bait and switch"".

318,"March 11, 2011","     I had been in the market for a used tundra for business.  So I stopped by Texas Toyota in Grapevine, and before I could get in driveway
Ryan Moore, a salesman, greeted me at my door and asked if he could help me. I told him what I was looking for and pointed out
several tundras that fitted my perimeters.  I looked at tundras and after deciding on one, I told Ryan how much I would
pay; I did not have a lot of time to negotiate a price, so I told Ryan to give me the best price or I am walking out.  About that time Will Schmidt, sales manager,  introduced himself and asked this question- "" What can I do to earn your business?"". So I told him, and he earned by business in record time.  I have bought several cars over the years from dealers, and I rate this dealership at the top.  Ryan and Will were
very professional and helpful.  Ryan made arrangements to pickup my trade-in at my house. He also came to my work and picked up
my tundra to have bed cover installed that I had ordered.  I appreciated the extra time and effort Ryan put forth.  Mike Ivey in finance
worked hard at getting a good interest rate on my loan.  Overall I had a pleasant experience at Texas Toyota.   Tell Hector thanks
for all the help in service department.  I will definitely tell all my friends to look at Texas Toyota before they buy anywhere else.

319,"January 13, 2011","I was looking for a new (used) car for my wife and saw an '02 VW Jetta on the lot during a Sunday night when they were closed.  I decided to go back and find out how much and the pertinent information about the car as the inventory sticker used at Texas Toyota is cryptic, unlike other dealers who put the price in the inventory number usually.  I pull up with my father in law and are immediately met by a salesperson as I stepped out of my truck.  I explained to him what I wanted to know about the car, mainly price, miles, and history of the vehicle.

He did not know off hand any of the information but told me to wait while he went and grabbed the keys and we could go on a test drive.  At this point, I figure why not, it's VW Jetta, they all drive pretty much the same.  We get in the car and do the test drive, all the while the salesman won't say much about the car other than the general ""see how well it rides,"" ""that 95HP motor is great,"" ""it won't use much diesel...""  We pull up the lot after the test drive and I believe great, here is where I get the information I have been wanting for some time now.

Not quite so fast, unfortunately.  At this point he says ""why don't we go inside and we can get all the information.""  So my father in law, myself, and the salesman end up at a table in the middle of the used car sales floor.  The place is dingy and grimy, not quite a well kept dealership.  At this point the salesman says he wants me to meet the used car sales manager.  Great I think, I just want to know about the car and how much.  The manager is pushy and brings to the table a 'contract' (and I use that term loosely), that says I will buy this car tonight when the price is told and we come to an agreement.  I told the manager I will sign no paperwork, either give me the information about the car or I walk.  He keeps pushing this 'contract' and I keep telling him no, all the while I can tell this has alarm bells all over it.  The used sales manager gets up from the table and says he needs to bring his manager over.  At this point my patience is gone.  I've been here for far too long not to have the information I came for.

So at this point my father in law and myself get up from the table and walk to my truck.  As I'm shutting the door, another 'manager' is running up to the truck and as I am about to pull out of the parking space is knocking HARD on my window saying ""let's make a deal, let's talk, let's...."" at this point, I wave good bye to him and drive away from the dealer as fast as I can.

To top this story off, the salesman calls me two hours later and tells me about the VW.  All the information I wanted and asked if I would like to come in and make a deal.  My answer included something along the lines of not only no but HELL no.

I have been so impressed by how horrible this Toyota dealer has been, that when I went to buy a used truck, I would not even step foot there to look at a used truck, even though they had one that I was looking for.  Absolutely a nightmarish experience, and till the day I am no longer coherent enough to keep about myself, I will never ever step foot at that dealership again.",5.0

333,"October 10, 2010","My husband and I have been searching for a Black Toyota Tundra and decided to take a Friday driving to different Toyota dealerships to see what was available. Knowing exactly what we were looking for we immediately asked the sales person if they had any Black Tundra's on the lot, he responded ""I think we do"" and about 20-30 mins later he explanined that the truck had just been traded in and hasn't been throught inspection or detail ""yet"". So we took a look and the console was ripped, full of dog hair and food crumbs. We just said nevermind and then Will "" I think a manager"" came outside and guaranteed that he would have it cleaned real quick and his interior people could fix the rip ""No big problem"" including the stratches on the outside.

So after they did a quick clean, we test drove the car and ended up in negotiations. So we finally came to negotiations that we all agreed on and decided we would make everything final the following day after the inspection and clean up was completed and meet our expectations. Several car sales people and managers asured us everything would be great and ready the next day. 

So we drive once again, over 40 miles from our home to look at this truck and complete the final agreement ""yeah right"". It took a while for them to bring the truck to us to inspect and kept wanting us to sign papers. My husband explained that he wanted to look at the truck first and take it to a machanic that we trusted, just for our peace of mind. When they finally brought the truck up the first thing we noticed was a ""NEW"" huge dent in the bumper, that was not there the day before. And the interior guy hadn't showed up that day so the rip and scratches were still present.

So I asked why they didn't call us to tell us the truck wasn't going to be ready, especially since we traveled so far, and then to end up with a new dent. We asked for our keys to our old car and left. they really had a sale ready to go, and screwed it up royaly. I have no trust in a dealership that can't meet any promises before buying a truck. Let alone the inspecting crew that wrecks that cars. Really how well are the doing the ""Certification"" if they cant even back up a truck properly.

After reading these reviews, I see it was really a blessing that we didnt get the truck. It probably would have ended up a hugh nightmare. I would not recommend this dealership to anyone.

PSS Note: While in the dealership a certain sales man in the facility had classic signs and symptoms of cocaine use. I know, I work professionally in that area that deals with addicts everyday. So the dealership might want to drug test their employees, that might make a huge difference in there facility.

Within one minute of speaking with me, that person (Mike) claimed I had an attitude and walked away. I would never do business with this organization again and have reported their actions to the Better Business Bureau.",4.8
347,"July 07, 2010",Mike was great in all areas that matter-friendly and very knowledgeable without being too pushy. Took lots of time to explain features on my Venza. He has followed up twice to see if I have any questions. Great customer service! Lisa was very helpful too.,5.0

349,"June 24, 2010","Wesley Wells had a lot to do with why I bought a used car from this dealership.  He was very personable, knowledgable and accommodating.  I told him exactly how much money I had to spend (no more - no less) and he located a car that would fit into my budget.  ",5.0
350,"June 23, 2010","What a great experience! I had a hassle free car buying experience, this was by far the easiest vehicle I have ever purchased.

352,"June 23, 2010","My wife and I recently purchased a new Venza and Tundra from Texas Toyota. Since we were in the market for 2 new cars and only had ideas about what we wanted/were looking for, the process of finding a good match was stressful- until we checked out Texas Toyota. The whole staff was patient, knowledgeable and eager to help. I didn't feel pressured or like I was being ""sold"". Being newly married, the financial part of the new cars is what I was worried about. The finance department was so helpful. They understood our situation and set me up with a great deal and low monthly payments. If you're looking for a new vehicle, I recommend you check them out. I'm proud to say I am a loyal Texas Toyota customer!   ",4.6
353,"June 22, 2010",Absolutely the best car buying experience I have ever had...I knew what I wanted buy and had a price in mind...I ended up paying less than expected and did not feel like I was in a high pressure sales situation like in other dealerships. Thanks to the team at Texas Toyota in Grapevine for making my purchase as easy as possible...,1.2
354,"June 17, 2010","My experience at this dealership has been horrible like many of the other experiences that I have read.  We bought a used BMW from this dealership and the battery was dead when they sold it to us, it left my pregnant daughter stranded at school the very next day.  The dealership did fix that, but promised us that they sent it to the BMW dealership to fix anything else that might be a problem, also told us that we would get a report from the BMW store.  Did not receive anything and the car had bad brakes.  Now not even 3 payments later we have had a bubble on a tire, had to replace brakes and now have a back window that will not roll up.  I contacted the sales person as well as the sales manager at the dealership and could not get a call back.  I then contacted Dustin Rogers, above both of them and he promised email after email that he was getting with BMW to get my report, well that has been since May 24th so here I am.  I would never buy a vehicle or recommend this dealership ever again in the future.  Buyer beware and search for their reviews because almost everyone I have read is a negative one.",1.8
355,"June 04, 2010","PLEASE..NEVER, and I mean NEVER work with this dealership!!!
Over the past 15 years, I have bought a lot of cars..This is by the far, the worst dealerships you can possibly buy from!! They tell you one price, but when you get to the table, it changes..How convenient!!",2.5
356,"May 18, 2010","WATCH OUT!! Made a last minute 6-hr drive to purchase a certified pre-owned Camry they had listed online. The salesman & manager rushed us thru the buying process & shoved an extended warranty down our throats. Days later, we found a defect & called about it. The salesman said he would check on how to handle it & return our call (but never did). After 3 weeks of calling & texting, the manager said they lost $300 on the sell to us & didn't want to repair it (which would have cost them only $300 or less - it will cost US $500+ to repair).
 
One would expect an imperfect vehicle buying from another individual, but not from a dealership! 

Well, knowing they got a commission from the extended warranty, we immediately cancelled it!

Wished we had read reviews from this site & the other 3 review sites before buying!

357,"December 27, 2009","Avoid at all COST.  These guys LIE, to get you in and then of course have a different vehicle then what is advertised.  The so called sales manager Mr. Ivey is deceitful and refuses to give back your keys once they get a hold of them.  They will tell you whatever they have too, to get you over to finance even if the information is wrong.  In the end my deal was going to cost me the price of my new vehicle plus all the lease turn in charges from my old one.  According to Mike, Honda would eat the overages and I would not be out any money.  Luckily my gut instinct told me to talk to honda.  They informed me I would owe $4500 in mileage overages and early turn in(as I expected).  Had I not gone to Honda I would have been paying these fees that Mr. Ivey said would ""disappear"" and the new car.  He thought my being a woman I would not think to check with Honda and after 24 hours I would not be able to get out of my contract.
Fortunatly I am smarter than these uneducated sales people.
My advice go ANYWHERE but here if you must have a Toyota. And never go alone, they will out number you and use every high pressure tactic known! ",2.4
358,"November 09, 2009","I did have an ok experience buying the car from the sale person, but I cannot say I have been very satisfied with the service I've received from the service team.  Here are the reasons why:

1- When the car was delivered, the gas tank was only 1/3 full.  I was told the gas pump was broken that day, and was promised the next time I would be at the dealership, they would fill the tank for me.  I have been back to the dealer 4 times since, but that promise has never been fulfilled.  Below are the times I came back to the dealer:
    -- 2 days after the purchase to drop off the cashier check to pay off the car
    -- about 1 week after the purchase to pick up the license plates
    -- about 2 weeks after the purchase to have the bodyside molding installed
    -- 6 months after the purchase to have the first oil change

2- Upon delivering the car, I was also promised that the first oil change service would be free if I bring the car back to Texas Toyota of Grapevine.  Just last month, when I brought the car in for the first service, to my surprise I was charge $60 for it.  Some friends of mine who recently purchased new cars from other Toyota/Nissan dealers all had their first oil change free of charge + full tank of gas.

3- When my car was returned after the first service, the technician who worked on my car left a stain on the front passenger seat.  

4- My last complaint is about the fact that my old car which was traded in at the time of the purchase of the 2009 TOYOTA HIGHLANDER was used to run the Toll Tag (at least) 4 times the following week.  Since the old license plates were still on the car, I was billed for the fees.  Fortunately, I have an account with NTTA; otherwise, I would have been charged with other violation charges for running the toll.  Whether it was Texas Toyota personnel or other car whole-sale company's personnel committing these violations is irrelevant to the fact that operation of your dealership should never cause customers such problem.",1.0
359,"October 27, 2009","I talked on the phone to a salesperson, and we agreed on a price for a specific used car I wanted.  I took a test drive, and went to the office to buy the car.  At that time a manager (not the sales man) came in with a sales contract showing a $400 increase in price.  The manager said they made a mistake and the price was $400 more than was originally agreed upon over the phone.  He said they made a mistake and they couldn’t sell the car for less.  After a long discussion, I agreed on the extra $400 increase, but asked that the $150 charge for paperwork be waived since I was paying cash.  Then a third manager came in a few minutes later, and he said there had been another mistake, and they upped the price another $400 making a total increase of $800.  A third manager came in after that to explain about the mistake, but said the price would stay the $800 extra from the original price I was quoted.  Before leaving I was told in confidence that the General Manager probably didn’t want to sell me the car, since he could get more money for it than what I was quoted.  At that point I walked out.",5.0
360,"May 14, 2009","I live in So.CA and shopped for a car in the Dallas area for my Grand daughter.  After a three week search and talking to many salesman about their best deals...I finally found Richard Self at Texas Toyota of Grapevine. He does car deals over the Internet and over the next four days we concluded a deal for a new Corolla LE and how to deliver it to my Grand daughter. They made the delivery today(5/13/09) and we were all very pleased with the service and professional attitudes of Richard and his staff. Especially JC Realpozo, who delivered the car and took the time to show an 18 year old girl how to operate her first car.  They all helped to made an old Grand Father feel very good.  They know how to treat their customers.  WRK, Temecula, CA",1.3
361,"November 18, 2008","Went for a new car - over priced ($1000 above invoice) - came back.
They called and left me a voice mail to come for a better deal, went in, they tried high pressure tactics to sell the vehicle - Walked out.

Was also told that the best way to improve credit score is to finance from ""Toyota Finance Corp""

They were initially friendly, but when they realized that I may not but the vehicle turned cold.",1.4
362,"July 16, 2007","POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE! As soon as I signed the papers, Texas Toyota of Grapevine was DONE with me. I have had to return to the dealership twice because they did not solve service issues while they had my truck. After MANY phone calls, getting transferred to voicemails and repeatedly getting disconnected, I finally managed to speak with supervisors who did what they had to do to ""keep me quiet"". After admitting they had made mistakes, their attempts to keep my business were as bad or worse than the problems I had in the first place. This dealership seems more concerned with moving product than keeping customers, so beware.",1.8
363,"May 03, 2007","I took my car there for the regular tune-up and a few other minor things. After yrs of going to this dealership/servicing dept, I know from experience it is a 1 day job. They needed to order a part so it ended up taking a rediculous 5 days to complete the regular servicing. They didn't offer a car for me to use during this time. Every day I called to check the status and sometimes I was lucky enough to reach someone. Often I was either sent to a vm or the call just rang and rang in the service area (sometype of vm problem). When I actually got someone on the line I was told it would be ready either later that day or possibly the next day. This must be their standard phrase because I heard it more than once. When I finally picked-up my car there was one selt belt part that they were still waiting for (unbelievable!) but I could come back at a later time (can't believe in all those days they couldn't get that part). Anyway weeks later I still hadn't heard from them about taking my car back in for the last part. During this timeframe they sent a survey and I responded that the experience wasn't as good as it has been in the past because I was still waiting for the last part to get in. Finally after weeks, I called to check on the part. The service advisor said that he recieved the review, it was the worst one he has ever gotten, and he wasn't going to complete the work. He said I wasn't welcome at that dealership/servicing dept either. I've been taking my car to this location for years and this is the first time I've ever had a problem with them. In the past, they've always received either good or great reviews. Lesson learned: This Toyota dealership/serving dept will cut ties with their customers unless they receive a favorable survey. They are not interested in keeping long-term customers.",3.3
364,"February 12, 2007","The visit was like going to a meat market.  The sales people I delt with had 7 days and 1 month experience.  The only reason I came back was that they had knowledgeable sales assignned to the Credit Union special desk.

Otherwise I would have left.  Also they add extra's of no value to the msrp.  Toyota needs to control this unprofessional behavior or it will start inpacting the buying experiebce. ... JMHO",1.2
365,"May 10, 2006","I visited this dealership about two years ago when I was shopping for a Toyota 4Runner.  Although I ended up buying a jeep elsewhere I was somewhat pleased with how I was treated.  Now I'm in the market for a truck and one of the ones I am considering is a Tundra.  I went to their website and submitted a credit app thinking I would get that out of the way.  I didn't imagine that something that simple would turn into an ordeal.  Two seperate guys called me.  They didn't want to give me an interest rate saying ""it all depends on the deal.  When can you come in and take a look?""  I said I would be more likely to do business with someone who was a little upfront instead of trying to get me in for the ""hard sell"" and right now, he wasn't in the running.  He changed his tune (you could hear the wind leaving his sails).  Said he would check and call me back.  He came back with an interest rate of ""14.9 or better"".  I found that insulting knowing that I had much better credit plus I had already received offers from all of lending tree's lenders for their best rates.  I told him he was already trying to rip me off and I hadn't even stepped foot on the property.  Since I didn't have much hope that things would improve instead of get worse that I would not be coming in and didn't want anyone else from them contacting me.  When are these guys going to learn that they would sell a lot more cars if they would just deal above the table instead of trying to screw you every step of the way.",1.0
366,"June 18, 2004","I looked at this dealership to buy a Toyota Echo. The sales ""kid"" was sarcastic and rude. He spent half the time talking with his friend versus trying to sell me a car.They low-balled my trade, but offered to give me more if I chose to use Toyota financing instead of USAA. They wanted sticker for the car because it was the ""last"" Echo around the area. According to the salesguy, Toyota wasn't making this car anymore. Um, check out Toyota's website...it clearly states there is a 2005 Echo coming out. The most humerous part was that the kid kept threatening to, ""put the car on ebay if I didn't buy it that day"". I have yet to see it sold on ebay. Don't shop at this dealership. They are jerks and seem more intent on selling to the 20 something generation. We 30+ seem unimportant.",1.3
