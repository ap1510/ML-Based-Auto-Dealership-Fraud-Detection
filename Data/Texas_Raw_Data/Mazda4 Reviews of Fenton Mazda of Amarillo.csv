1,"August 22, 2017","When you buy something, you expect the title, right??
Our son bought a camper from this place. He fixed it up and someone wanted to buy it. Come to find out, there is an issue with our son getting the title for the camper. Could they have sold it to him and maybe they should not have? He has called too many times to count and has dealt with James and Robert. They hang up on him, put him on hold, send him to voice mail, etc. Unfortunately, it appears we are going to have to get an attorney involved just to get what is rightfully our sons. No worries, we will request that THEY pay all attorney fees. He paid for the camper. They refuse to take care of things on their end. Just from this experience, be VERY CAREFUL when dealing with these people. Things seem to be a bit shady and unethical. And they are trying to take advantage of a 21 year old. MANY attempts have been made to rectify this situation amicably. They CHOOSE not to! All our son needs is the title. Simple, right? Not with these guys! ",1.5
2,"January 27, 2017","My fiancé and I recently purchased a car from Fenton Mazda from Sam. It had a few spots that needed to be touched up and we were promised they would get it fixed. We took it maybe a week later for it to get fixed and when we came to pick up the car it looked like someone just painted over the spots with nail polish that didn't even match the color of the car. We complained and Sam promised to get it fixed right. He gave us the name and number to Chaz, which is the guy that was doing the touch up job. He came and buffed off the paint he had put on there and said he would fix it again. He said numerous times he was coming but he ended up standing us up and having excuse after excuse. He even reassured us that he would not be able to make the touch up look like there was nothing ever there. In my opinion if you can't do a touch up job then you are in the wrong profession. Finally I call Sam and tell him we need someone else to do the job because this Chaz guy was horrible and unprofessional, Sam said he would tell the manager to give me a call back. After still not hearing anything from Sam or a manger, we called again and finally the told us to bring the car in on Wednesday January 25 2017. They called and said the car was ready on Friday January 27 2017 so my fiancé went and picked it up only to find the same crappy paint job and a new scratch that was not there before we took in the car! We have had the worst experience with this dealership. Let me add we purchased this car December 2 2016 and we have been battling this for over a month. We complained again saying this is still wrong and even mentioned the new scratch and they claim there is nothing they can do about it now. Would not recommend anyone going here! ",1.0
