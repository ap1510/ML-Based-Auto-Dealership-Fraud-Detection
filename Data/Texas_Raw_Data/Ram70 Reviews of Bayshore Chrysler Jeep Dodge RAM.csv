0,"April 11, 2020","Purchased $65,000.00 vehicle 4 years ago.  Have done all our service since.  This week dropped the ball big time on ""showroom ready"" car wash for over $150.00 that had to be redone and still able to wipe dirt of wheel wells.  Very dissatisfied with efforts to retain loyal customer.  Our intentions to keep their service employees in work during this pandemic was a mistake.   Do not utilize their car wash services at all!

1,"January 29, 2020","Bought a vehicle from them had it 2 months and it has been in 3 different shops due to the ""Death Wobble and Death Sway"".  Sadly they could not fix their own vehicle that they sold to me after having 4 chances to try. They got mad when I said I was bringing my lawyer into it and they kicked us out of the dealership along with my broken down vehicle. It took 3 dealerships to finally get it fixed. How sad that they do not own up to their mistakes. This could have been easily taken care of. I put a good down payment on it and did the extended warranty. They charged me the downpayment for the warranty to fix the Lemon that they sold. They will screw you over just to get money. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM.

3,"November 20, 2019","I found a car online through Autotrader and checked it on their website. I called the dealership first thing in the morning (9am) Saturday and got a salesman (either called DJ or JD not sure). I asked him to confirm the price and that they had it in stock still, he said he'd check and call me back. About an hour later I got a call back to confirm they had the car (in fact it was still wrapped in plastic) and that the price was good. I asked for an out the door price and he said he'd get back to me. After that I heard nothing. I called him about noon and was told he was too busy to speak to me but I could leave a message, which I did. No call back at all. Around 1pm I decide to drive over since I couldn't get hold of him so I take the hour long drive to the dealership. I arrive and DJ/JD shows me to his office and asks me to wait a moment. That's the last time we see that guy, he stayed hidden in the sales office for the rest of our time there. He sends in a ""sales manager"" who says the price online is wrong, there is no dealer discount on the car but maybe I'd like to look at it? Well that was a waste of a day. What's worse? It's now Sunday, and they STILL haven't fixed the price on their website, what a coincidence... I thought most of these cheap car dealer tricks were a thing of the past with the advent of internet competition, but apparently not.",1.2

6,"March 19, 2019",They sold me a lemon! Basedon my credit I was told there was only 1 vehicle I qualify for 2017 jeep renegade. At 30000 miles transmission started doing hard shift at 30 moh. After a number if times in service they simply said they coukd not duplicate even thougha known issue. Now at 40000 miles the car burns up all the oil before the 5000 interval and im told its normal. Clearly Ive been taken advantage of. Thankfully I found dealership in Pasadena willing to do fuel consumption test. I will NEVER buy Chrysler dodge jeepor anything. Never had a problem with nissan or toyota ,1.0

10,"February 05, 2018","9 days after purchasing a brand new truck I started having transmission issues. I reported it to the dealership but with no lights and codes they said, “let it break in it will likely go away.” I continued to have problems and 20 days after my purchase having not even making my first payment, still with paper plates, and with 1,183 miles on the engine my transmission was completely shot and I had to get it towed to the dealership. I was given a loaner which also had engine ticks and clinking under the carriage. I reported it to the dealership as soon as I got home and they said, “it will work its way out once I drive it.” Several days after my truck was in the shop and my original truck now needing a new transmission and my loaner making engine noises I was done with Dodge and my peace of mind in buying a new truck from them was gone! I wanted nothing to do with Dodge! I went back to the dealership to express this and return the loaner because I didn’t want to drive another truck that was already having issues. When speaking to the General Manager he asked, “what do you need to be put in for your second loaner?” I said, “a truck.” He said, “why is that?” I said, “because that’s what I bought.” He asked again, “but is there a particular reason you need a truck?” I said, “because I live in the country and if I need to haul something (in the bed of my truck) I can.” He had the extreme poor taste on judgement to say crack a joke at my expense and say, “well that’s why you’re having transmission problems right there!” And laughed. At that point I have never been so insulted and I let him know that joking about my situation was in no way funny. I was given a second loaner and I was on my way. I opened up a case with Dodge to request a buy back. Today as I arrived at work the second loaner started acting crazy the computer screen got stuck and started making noises and was bouncing back and forth with thick lines down the screen, wouldn’t react to any bottoms and did it for 2 minutes before I finally took the keys out of the ignition and opened the door and several seconds later it finally stopped. Bayshore Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ramm this was supposed to be an exciting time but 100% of my peace of mind is now gone. I’m not sure that anyone is my shoes would be happy with their brand new truck purchase needing a new transmission 20 days after the purchase and two loaner trucks with issues. If I have ANYTHING to do with it...I will NEVER be driving a Dodge again when this nightmare is over!",1.0

The no appointment needed policy is cool for me because I’m always busy and if I have a bit of time I can go in and out fast. Love how they have a rewards program too and they have coupons all the time! The staff is very friendly and notify you when your car is ready. I really recommend coming here even if it’s not the location you bought your car from. Ever since I started coming here instead of where I brought it from it’s been a better experience.,5.0

21,"September 30, 2017","I should have read Ric's review of this place before I brought my vehicle here, they have the worst customer service ever, I had to complain many times and they didn't even fix my car right the first time, they are too lazy to work with extended warranties, I had to pay out of pocket for a sensor that would have been covered by the extended warranty. They also left my drivers window down while being repaired here while it was raining and water got into my vehicle, Manager Brandon was unapologetic about all my concerns and Dan and Sam were ruid and not helpful at all, I usually don't care for reviewing places but this place is so bad, I feel it is my obligation to fellow man to tell you guys to avoid this place for any repairs or anything that has to do with the shop.. They are rude, they lack customer service, they will not know anything about your car if you try to call them over the phone or return phone calls.. In short what they will make false promises, just to try to get you the answer you want, and then not follow through with any of it. I can't speak for there sales team.",1.0

25,"April 29, 2017","Like everyone, I hate going to buy a truck and, before buying here, I've always left the dealership feeling violated. I can't say enough good things about Jarvis in sales and James in finance. They made buying a pleasure and my wife and I left with a smile on our faces. No buyers remorse whatsoever. They were straight up with us on pricing, no run around, shenanigans, or fees we weren't told about up front. I will always shop these guys first. A+ from me. We even got to meet the owner, who was a great guy, very personable and down to earth. By far the best vehicle buying experience of my lifetime. ",5.0

David was very knowledgeable on inventory of the Preowned Side as well as the new. I really needed a new vehicle and the Preowned Salesman (David Heard) helped me through the process step by step instruction and the paperwork I needed to have when i was ready to give up on the search i was given his card by a friend at the bayway dealership and called him and 1 week later i have a beautiful Preowned Charger...

27,"April 10, 2017","We have a 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee Summit that was dropped off 5 days ago for warranty work.  One of the issues was that the check engine light had come on, which resulted in an email notifying us to take the vehicle in for service to the powertrain.  We scheduled an appointment to drop it off last Thursday morning (April 6, 2017) at 9am.  Upon arrival, they told us that they would not be able to give us a rental (even though the vehicle is still under 36k miles) until they could diagnose what was wrong.  They then inform us that it might be 7 days before they can diagnose it.  Seriously!!  I will NEVER buy another Jeep and will definately NEVER take a vehicle to this service department EVER AGAIN.  To make things worse, they called and said that there is nothing wrong with it.  Hmmm ... so we have the email showing the check engine light had come on, but there is nothing wrong.  SO DONE WITH CHRYSLER / JEEP!!",1.3

I only had the car a day when the tire pressure light came on and I found that there was a nail in the sidewall of the tire. Bayshore did not hesitate to order a brand new tire and replace it.  I also upgraded to leather interior and again Brad and Bayshore took every step  possible to handle my requests very professionally.  Job well done.  I am very happy and have told everyone I know to be sure and take their business to Bayshore... Ask For Brad!!,5.0
34,"September 12, 2016","I went to purchase a vehicle and was very disappointed in the service and professionalism of not only the sales representative but the management team as well. During the process of negotiations the Sales Managers were  belittling and disrespectful in their mannerisms when speaking to me. Also the sales representative and management team  and I had agreed on a price and signed agreeing to the price and then they backed out of the price agreed. I believe it's unprofessional  to agree,and in writing, and not stand behind their word. So if you want a company that will belittle woman, is unprofessional, unreliable and doesn't stand behind their word then buy from Bayshore! ",1.0
35,"August 23, 2016","If you buy a vehicle, the warranty is only as good as the service department. This service department is the worst I have ever seen, period.. If you call they will put you on hold, pick up the phone and put it back on hold until it sometimes it hangs up. If you have a problem they will run different people at you to keep you from talking to anyone in charge. If they can find a way to deny a warranty item and charge you for it, they will, justified or not.  They don't diagnose problems, they just change out parts until it starts working, and charge you for all the parts, and labor to install them, needed or not. I have done fleet service for over 30 years, and I have never seen a service department like this.  Like some of the other posters said, don't walk, run away from this one.",1.0

Run from this dealer, run.  Do not stop, do not give them any of your money.  Every person I dealt with  LIED, zero integrity.  Take your business to ANY of the other Chrysler Jeep Dodge dealers in Texas.

43,"February 26, 2016","My wife and I drove throught the lot just looking at what they had with no intentions of purchasing on this day. I was looking for a 2016 Power Wagon but I was undecided. We saw a Plum Crazy Purple Challenger sitting on the lot so we stoped to take a look at it. The sales man that came out and talked to us was not pushy and was very nice. I had told him I was not sure if I wanted a Challenger or the Power Wagon but that I would keep him in mind. My wife and I went on to do what we had to do and we talked about it and decided to get the car. We called the sales man and told him that we wanted that Challenger and if he could get started with the paper work, we would be in shortly. After about 30 min he called back and said the one we were looking at was not for sale because someone had put a deposit on it but we could still come in and he could find us one. When we got their we saw the 2016 Plum Crazy Scat Pack on the show room and joked arround about it. After doing some paperwork we eneded up leaving with that car. I am so please with Mike and the staff at Bayshore for how they treated us and the way the worked with us on this process.

Bayshore dealership in baytown tx
We were talking to a  saleperson they call LT then he went talk to the manager.The sale manager was talking to me and boyfriend in his office.He was talking to me about my car that I return to there dealership.He told me I'm not going to give your money back or help you out cause I don't like your attitude so you can get the car off the lot.For the record i didnt have no attitude with him i was just asking him question and he was acting like it was a problem to answer the question.He the one that was all hostile towards me.You would think a man that has a wife and daughters my age would know how talk to a women.But i guess he miss that lesson and guess they let anybody work at car dealership these days.In the whole time we were talking to him he kept asking my boyfriend what is his and my age.Then ask with attitude did you not know you were signing a contract.It the dealership job to go over the contract with the consumer letting them know the car price percentage rate and everything else pretending to that vehicle not going over this is against the law.I told him what kind of question is that if they would told me the total price of the car and explain the contract like to suppose I would of never got the car.I told him don't insult my intelligence in the reason for that was cause he kept mentioning my age acting like i don't know nothing.He made me feel some type of why and I have never been so disrespected in my life.We wasnt even done talking to him in he just to us we can leave cause he done talking to us and we can get out his office.Before we left we made sure we told him that his age define him cause he the one don't know how talk to somebody.First I'm grown women in you would think the manager would be more professional and conduct his self in a respectful matter.Just cause you the sale manager dont means nothing to me you should have a little more respect and better attitude towards people cause I'm the consumer and I have vast number of car buying option available to me at other dealership.You act like the car is not on your property i dont want it cause thats to much money to pay for a chrysler 200.You can not repo a car on your on lot its against the law.I return your car therefore you should return the bank there money.I dont want to deal with a company that isnt polite and respectful.He didn't talk to me how he suppose to he act like my age got something to do with my decision on buying a car now that makes no sense.I find him to be very arrogant,rude, and trying to intimidate me. I want the dealership to give me a paper saying they gone give the bank back there money.I'm trying to talk to the dealership in settle this dispute between us.The purchase of a new vehicle is suppose to be a negotiation between the buyer and dealer.I could file a huge law suit against the dealership for discrimination-the injust or prejudicial treatment of different categories of people or things especially on the grounds of race age or sex.Civil rights law states unlawful discrimination refers to unfair or unequal treatment of an individual based on certain characteristics like age gender race marital status and many more.If the dealers use buyers race age or gender to make statistical inferences about expected profitability of selling to them this is discrimination.I just want them to rescind the contract.",1.0

John,

I am sending you this email because of the way I felt I was very mislead into coming into your dealership.  I was very prepared to buy a car today
for my 27th Anniversary and instead I got a slap in the face.  You sent me a note about wanting to look and purchase my Durango.  I told my 
husband this was to good to be true...  In your note you even went as far as to say to I would be very pleased with your aggressive offer.

So against my better judgement I agreed to come in and look. And even had a car picked out I even went as far as to have a backup one just 
in case the one I wanted was a little out of my reach.  But instead I got the biggest slap in the face with the offer you gave me for my trade in on my car.
If that was your aggressive offer that was not even a joke it was an insult.  

I know that this email will just be over looked and wrote off.  But at least I wanted you to know that I was really upset.  I am sure that this does not 
even matter to you but it did to me.

I looked at the Blue Book I knew what it was worth and I knew what I could do and instead it was a joke and the fact that I took the time to come to 
the dealership and get my hopes up.   Shame on me for being that trusting in  people and their words.  I was told this was not going to work and it was just a way to 
get me in but what little did I know.  

Well enough said I am just really disappointed because I had talked my husband into letting me trade my car today.  And that this would be a wonderful Anniversary Gift...


Sincerely

51,"July 12, 2015","This review is long overdue but I wanted to wait a month or so to make sure all went well and it has turned out to be fantastic. My salesmans name was Jeremy and like most car salesman he was not. He is experienced just like there financing dep. is and didn't feel the need to blow a lotta smoke up my xxx to make a sale. I got there early evening on a Saturday and I wasn't pressured as soon as I pulled in. I was allowed to look peacefully and when assistance was needed it was there In a friendly manner. They even stayed late to see the deal through. One last thing that shocked the xxxx outta me is when sitting down with finance I recieved a better deal than originally made. I had below average credit with money down of course,  but they saw I had struggled some in the past and didn't suck me dry and sending me off. All I will say is they worked with me and I had a little more than I had planned. I give 5 stars and will go back someday I just hope the same staff is able to assist me. ",5.0

I  went back to the dealership and told them my issues I was having, they agreed to look at my vehicle.  When they found out what was wrong with it, they went ahead and ordered the parts and asked if I could come back in a few days to have my vehicle fixed. They fixed it with no problems.

Was of great assistance and very helpful while not being too pushy about selling it either. ",4.8
55,"May 25, 2015","Took my 2014 Jeep Wrangler in to have soft top looked at.  Zippers were defective.  Service tech thought so too.  Was told Service Manager would have to make the call if warranty would cover it.  He was never there.  This went on for 3 weeks they finally took pictures to send in to Chrysler Corporate offices and they never sent pictures.  Chrysler Corporate got involved they finally got pictures and then they DENIED my warranty coverage. I then purchased an aftermarket top and then after continue to complain to Chrysler they are going to reimburse a portion of the top.  THIS USED TO BE THE BEST DELEARSHIP THAT I HAD EVER DEALT WITH- BARR NONE.  NOT ANY MORE.  WHAT EVER HAPPEN TO THE OLD SAYING '""CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT""  Will not have to worry about this customer any more.",1.0
56,"May 18, 2015","I have a Dodge truck and my daughter bought a 2014 dodge ram.  It had a recall for the third brake light.  She had taken it in on a Wednesday prior to the service department opening.  She called and told them about the brake light and she needed her oil changed also.  On Friday after several call about the status of her vehicle we went up to the service department.  The cashier said that there was no information about our vehicle and what had been done.  The manager (Joe) was retrieved and said that they had not touched our truck yet.  I demanded my keys back.  Joe said that when we bring it back for the recalled light and oil change it would be ready same day.  We took the truck today and called this evening about it and was told that it was not ready because the technician had not finished the oil changed.  He was in the middle of it and it was time to clock out, so he did and left.  Now I'm without my truck again and will have to wait until tomorrow.  I will never use this dealership for service again.",1.7
57,"March 19, 2015","It's been nothing but problems with these people. I would love to understand how this establishment is still up and running. I had a brand new jeep sold to me with my sunroof tubes not connected then they ""fixed"" then I wended up getting my car flooded which just led to them pulling up my carpet and letting it dry out.already gotten my transmission replaced a couple days after that Spent 220 on a neutral switcher cable that they claim needed to be fixed and come to find out my car only turns on when it's in neutral. But they claim nothing is wrong. They take a week to even see your car, a week -two weeks to ""fix"", and then you're right back up there two days later. This place is a joke and the people are rude and have no consideration for their customers. I tell everyone NOT to buy there and tell them about my car. I wish I got paid to apparently do nothing but to sit on my xxx all day. The brought in a new manager to fix things but still hasn't changed my mind, I dropped my car off Monday and today when spoken with him he couldn't even find my car. 
I wish I could do a whole refund on my car. Yall don't even deserve a star but I can't go past these point without giving yall one. ",1.0
58,"December 05, 2014","I bought a NEW vehicle and asked for cloth-seat trade for leather($1500). They  sent my car to an upholsterer instead of putting in factory leather seats that I thought I was getting. When I got my car back the seats looked terrible. After 3times of my car at the upholsterer and 1month I have this new-car and sloppy-seats and now a 36,000 note that I wish I would have signed to give to another dealership.",2.2
59,"October 22, 2014","I very seldom give a positive review unless the folks really exceed my expectations, but I recently purchased a Dodge Ram 2500 from Bayshore Dodge and Mike (the GM) and Steve (our sales rep) made the whole experience very enjoyable.  No high pressure, they just met all my requests on price and trade in.  I got the deal I wanted without having to fight and argue over it, which is usually the way it goes when buying a new vehicle. And the truck I ended up with is gorgeous.    My wife and I loved it as soon as we saw it.  I would recommend Bayshore Dodge to any and everyone.",5.0
60,"August 04, 2014","I called Bill Dooley about a Ram 1500 and within a few minutes received an excellent price.  He was easy to work. I worked a little harder on the interest rate, but I still managed to get a good interest rate. My wife and I  arrived late at the dealership the day of my purchase. John Addison handled the paperwork with no rush and explained everything in detail. He was  a great guy as well.  It was well after the dealership closed when we actually took delivery of our new truck. Bill stayed an extra hour to go over all of the features of our new vehicle.  The experience of purchasing a new truck  from Bayshore was a pleasant  one. I will recommend them to anyone I know in the market for a new vehicle.

61,"October 04, 2013","Very Bad service,..On October 1, 2013 I took my wifes 2012 Jeep Sahara for an oil change at this dealership. I did not purchase this jeep at this dealership but since I had recently moved to the area I figure I keep it local and take it for an oil change to the local Chrysler Jeep dealership. I never imagined it would be the worst day in my life. I take pride in buying new vehicles and taking them to dealerships were they can be serviced and do the routine inspections needed to keep the vehicles value current. But on this day that pride I had in taking the vehicles to a dealership came to an end with the experience I got with this dealership. After getting my jeep back from an oil change I went to drop off the jeep back to my wifes work. After I left my wifes work she would leave her work to pick up my kids from school. After driving the jeep not even half the block she told me the oil light came on and then the jeep started to make knocking noises. She told me she felt like someone had done something to her jeep and felt hopeless and could not do anything about it. She drove back to her work and called me and then called the dealership for answers. The dealership told her not to drive it and that she needed to call the roadside assistence to have the jeep brought back to their place. By now I get wind of what just happen and I put two together and assume it had something to due with the oil change at the dealership. I was upset that my wife was going through this and I could not be there because I was on my way to work. I was also upset that the dealership would tell her what she needed to do INSTEAD of the dealership taking charge and them making arrangements to pick up the jeep and then personally going out there to speak to her and assure her that they would get to the bottom of the situation and that didnt happen until my wife got mad and let the dealership know how she really felt. It was determined that the tech had put a double seal on the filter which caused the oil to spill and causing me to have the dealership wanting to put a NEW engine on the jeep. Now to some people this would be the solution for the dealership to replace the engine but to me that is not the case. I really feel that I got cheated on this. The jeep is not the jeep I onced had and I dont know what to expect if I was to have them put in a new engine in the jeep. I dont know if this gesture would completly be the solution . The jeep has to have a new engine put in it becuase of a stupid mistake and now I am stuck with a jeep that pretty much lost its value and now it is worth alot less then what I owe on it. I take pride in taking extra measures so this jeep and my other two vehicles hold their value. I feel cheated and hopeless that that was taking away from me. I am somewhat speechless and I am very angry. I will be consulting legal representation to look into this matter and I want the owner of this dealership to contact me so that I can speak with him on this matter. I dont want to talk to the service manager, I want to talk to the owner",1.0
62,"September 21, 2013","This dealiership could not be more helpful, friendly or easy to deal with. I tried to buy a new Ram 1500 Crew Cab on Memorial day but there was none within 1000 miles that had the features i wanted. When we ordered from the factory we were told we had to wait for them to start building the trucks for the 2014 model year. We waited and in late August a new truck just like i wanted was delivered. Though the Factory incentives had changed from Labor Day, Micheal Kinney and Steve Love gave me special consideration and i was very happy with my new truck and the price. The delivery was very smooth. Steve spend over an hour helping me through all the options so i understood how they worked before i drove off the lot.
I highly recommend these folks to anyone who wants a good deal and to be treated like a valued customer. Thank you Bayshore Chrysler Jeep Dodge !",5.0
63,"August 29, 2013","Bayshore Jeep is a Top Notch dealer that is worth the drive even if you live quite a distance as I do.  Our salesman, Steve Love was excellent.  He was very knowledgeable about the vehicle I wanted, he was professional, friendly and HONEST!  
Our experience with Bayshore left us with a renewed good feeling that there really are honest dealerships out there and this is certainly one of them.
John Addison in the finance department was equally as knowledgeable, friendly, and honest.
I would certainly recommend Bayshore  (and will) to everyone who want a Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge, or Ram.",5.0
64,"August 13, 2013",I really appreciated Xavier Wallace in regards to allowing me to test drive vehicles and no high pressure sales tactic for me to purchase a vehicle that day.  Most sales personnel want you to buy that day and if not you can tell they don't want bothered with you. I told him I needed three days to decide and I didn't receive any phones calls asking if I planned on purchasing the vehicle.  I want to say the Xavier was the reason for my purchase from Bayshore Dodge.  ,4.8

68,"December 31, 2012","Absoltely the finest truck buying experience that I have ever had.  The people are very easy to work with and quote their best deal right away - no stalling or haggling.  They present the product in an expert fashion, thoroughly explaining all of the electrical and other systems in layman's language.  I would recommend this dealership to everyone who is looking for a new or used vehicle.

I was sent to this dealer by Jerry Reynolds - the Car Pro Guy on radio 740.
