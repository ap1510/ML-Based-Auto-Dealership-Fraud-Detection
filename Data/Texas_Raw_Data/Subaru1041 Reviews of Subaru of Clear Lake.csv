My Subaru has many problems now. Service inept and sell me things that don't fix the problem. Almost as if they are rolling the dice at my expense. If the computer can’t give them a code they understand, problem will never be fixed. Why? Because they are not professional mechanics!
They don’t fix anything, they just replace things and hope it’s the right item. Then plug the computer and read code again. I ended up going to a real professional mechanic, it was much cheaper and they gave me a loner unlike Gilman Subaru. BTW, I immediately noticed all sort of parts were missing after Gilman worked on my car. They forgot to bolt all sorts of shrouds and things back on. The oil was changed even though I told them (Don’t change my oil please). Even a simple battery replacement and they forget to put covers or shroud back over battery terminals. Something went wrong with the oil change and engine compartment is covered in oil. My new professional mechanic cleaned it up and explained the situation to me. I basically need to sell the vehicle since it’s been permanently damaged by Gilman. Just save yourself the trouble and shop someplace else. Definitely! Don't Get Service Done Here! The children here that work on $43,000+ new cars are so incapable, you may find tires way over inflated, missing valve caps or just didn't even do the multi-point inspection at all. I know this for certain!

1,"December 21, 2019","Is your Subaru a Lemon? I'm afraid mine is. My list of problems is quite long. Surely I am not alone when I say Gilman will not fix any problems until the car has to be towed in. They waited until control arms broke and bushings failed causing a wreck before a single repair. I began asking at 4K miles, they marked my visit as an oil change?  Even the windshield seal is popping out and looks awful, vibrates, leaks. Tailgate won’t open, windows roll down and won’t roll up until rolled all the way down then up, they immediately roll back down halfway. This is so horrible on highway rainstorms.  Car stalls, surging destroyed suspension, I’ve gone through 4 sets of 60k mile tires in under 30k miles (tire warranty is useless)  plus many alignments over $100 per. Oil was overfilled by large volume at dealership which damaged engine which is covered in oil mist. The cvt wouldn’t shift! It redlined and oil leaks from turbo now. Oil and gas consumption is very high, cvt locked up on me and made a full skid stop, so scary! Police stopped me!  They wont fix until the warranty is out. Beware of this auto manufacturer! The head of store Michael Mynatt greeted me with a baseball bat! I never yelled, cursed or gave a reason for this cruel treatment. Then he called me 10 times screaming at me for complaining to corporate and hiring lawyer, I had to block his cell number!  RUN!! and Never look back! Worst auto experience ever and I’ve owned so many nice cars. Lexus has far less lemons than any other auto. My brother beats his old Lexus up and it still runs great! My old dodge Cummins has over half a million miles on it, no unusual problems! SUBARU IS NOT GOOD OR CHEAP ANYMORE, RUN!!

2,"August 30, 2019","I purchased my Forester brand new in 2016 from this dealership and I’ve already had to change out my break switch and now my AC is out. It’s three years old..
Today At the dealership the technician tells my husband not only is the AC evaporator bad (which we knew already) but also the compressor is too. My husband knows enough about cars to call them out on their BS. He ask the tech how he knew, he said because it won’t turn on. My husband told him because it’s low blah blah.. Turns out the tech tells my husband “ well it’s not bad, we just recommend getting it changed out” so our quote went from $1500 to $3000 to add a compressor in there. Just because why not. TOTAL SCAMMERS.so first it’s bad then it’s not.  If they were speaking to someone who knew nothing about cars they wouldn’t question it. It’s bad enough we’re having to replace a part that is supposed to last 10-15 years in only 3 years but then they try to scam us!? 
These Mechanics are a joke (like many of them out there).

3,"August 29, 2019","I have always been a Subaru Fan from the very beginning and with way Paul Steinberg introduced me to the reality of owning a Subaru, this brand will forever be a benchmark for me. My hands down to Paul for giving me the opportunity to own one now. I very satisfied on how he handled the whole transaction and facilitating a very good deal to me. I love the 2019 Forester. I won’t trade it for another except if ever an XT model will come around again. Thank you Paul for getting me own one for real.",5.0

5,"June 18, 2019",If you want your car returned not fixed and taken apart go to this dealership. Car returned with bolts missing.   You walk in and you will be told  “no work will be done to vehicle without error code produced by your car”.   This dealership should not be allowed to operate.  Two trips to this dealership with same problem.   Service Manager along with service department inept.  They have no mechanics and no professionals in service Department.  Do yourself a favor and avoid this dealership.  ,1.0
6,"March 30, 2019","Subaru of Clear Lake (Gillman) broke my daughter’s heart and ensured that we will never shop at a Gillman brand ever again. 

We had a deal to purchase a vehicle on Monday at 5. At 4:23, we got a text saying the vehicle had been sold to someone else. After confirming the schedule at 3:40. 

We saw the vehicle just before closing on Saturday evening. I texted our salesman, Jacob Moniz, on Sunday morning to tell him we wanted to purchase the vehicle. On Monday morning, we texted back and forth about the details (the price had increased, but the manager agreed to honor Saturday’s promotional price). We set a time for us to come in and complete the paperwork. My husband left work early, so we could get there at 5.  He wanted the kids to witness the purchasing process since the car would be their first car. My daughter was over the moon. Until we got the text saying it had been sold to someone else just as we were on our way to the dealership. She was devastated. We all were. 

I saved the entire text history and planned to share it with anyone who would listen. Thank you to the manager for asking my opinion. I hope that the request was genuine and that the manager will use this information to improve their employees’ unethical practices. I have never been more disappointed in a business transaction. My guess is they got an offer to purchase the car at the increased price, so threw my family under the bus. I would have happily come in earlier to purchase the car, if necessary. The only reason we were coming in later was so the kids could fully participate in the purchase of their first car. 

It was a big deal. It was special. And this dealership made it a horrible experience. 

We will never shop at a Gillman brand dealership, again. ",1.6
7,"March 30, 2019","I bought my first Subaru forester in 2016 Robbie was the salesman we had the pleasure of working with ,I fell in love with the forester. I am really short and the forester seat will raise up to a position most people sit naturally. Robbie was full of information and explained every option the car had and how to use it .He shared where everything and everywhere in the dealership we may ever need. Mt car was involved in an accident and I needed a new car .You guessed it I went back to see Robbie and as always he went above and beyond to meet my needs In the purchase of a new replacement . Thanks Robbie, TaTa  and Tippy Toes. It was nice meeting snake eyes as well. My suggestion to anyone with a negative to say is Go talk to these guys they will make it right .",5.0
8,"March 09, 2019","I came in wanting to get an outback or forester for $350, brought my approval letter from USAA (FCU).

Ended up getting a better deal leasing through the dealer, no APR. Fantastic deal, and gained more features.

Really happy with Subaru, the sales representative Brandon was by far the best car salesman I've ever encountered. He was funny and polite, really good talking to him.

As for the finance guy, absolutely the best as well. When I was at other dealers (Honda of Clear Lake and Toyota of Alvin) they both had rude finance managers that try to sell you a million warranties and argue about it.  However at Subaru, the finance guy understood that my budget was met and that I didn't want any warranties and didn't spend more than two minutes letting me think then telling me I knew what was best etc. I really liked Subaru's no pressure sales and finance teams, they really understand how to make me feel comfortable buying.

Many thanks again to Brandon, I highly recommend this auto dealer.",5.0
9,"October 17, 2018","Oil & filter change...OK..I think.  Claimed a multitude of checks were also made...not so.  Said I needed a new engine air filter and cabin air filter at 15,900 miles.  Don’t think so!  Said tire pressure was OK.  Got tire pressure warning three days later.  This is no longer a Lithia Subaru operation, it is a Gilman shop now!  Purchased my Outback in January 2017.  Will not return.",1.8
10,"August 27, 2018","Love my Subaru Outback, not the dealer! They TRIED to sell me a car over the sticker price by $5,000 and tried to make me think I was getting a great deal and they were having a BIG 2 day sale. My husband found the sticker price in the glove box just when we were getting ready to sign the papers. They reduced the price when we were ready to walk, I don’t like dealers that waste your time and play games! David Kircus was the swindler!",1.3
11,"August 27, 2018","First both Crystal and Eral were great in house. The problem was after...I bought a used vehicle, paid in full and I dare say that since I did so it resulted in my lack of continued service after driving off the lot. One week after buying I have over $650 in issues resulting from a headlight that was out. Mind you the dealership inspected and passed the vehicle. Any other inspector would not have passed it simply due to a headlight being out. Had they caught that they would have discussed the costly fix. It is my hope that they did not pass off this vehicle knowing the issue but how could you not IF it had indeed been inspected correctly? I was told there was a 60 warranty but have zero replies when I reached out before i paid out of my pocket for the fix. Beware...",2.8

19,"August 20, 2018","The sales department is always a bit slow as was the case on ...day but Andy Hollister to the immediate rescue! I was about to walk out but saw my initial contact person was in the middle of an “intense negotiation” that deserved his total focus. I understood and would want that too when needed. But I alas was left hanging. I Saw Andy and knew him from past dealings and told him the situation. Well he immediately stepped up and lucky for him he made the sale! Thanks so much Andrew Hollister. You’re the best, best, best! 👍😎🐬🌴 
The guys in service go out of their way to help you, inform you and research your specific needs and warranty at the time you need to know, on your timeline, not theirs necessarily. And always a car spritz too! “Smilin Service”! Thanks all, great dealership. ",5.0

30,"August 13, 2018","I absolutely love Subaru of Clear Lake. I purchased my 2017 Subaru Forester from this dealership last year, and every time I stop by for a routine oil change and maintenance their customer service is top notch. Most recently I had to have a couple of repairs done to my vehicle due to some damages, and they provided the best care to my vehicle throughout the whole process. Alex and Michelle were the services reps that I worked with, and they did a great job and provided top notch customer service. ",5.0
31,"August 13, 2018","My first two visits were great, but something happened to this service dept between my last visit in Feb 2018 and today.  First of all, they no longer take appointments, so a simple oil change took an hour and 30 minutes.  During my 1-1/2 hour wait, I thought I would enjoy a cup of coffee.  Unfortunately, there were no coffee cups and nobody to ask.  I went digging for them in the cupboards, found some and so stocked the counter for them.  Then I went to make my coffee and got a cup of tan hot water.  The machine was out of coffee.  I found someone to load coffee into the machine.  I decided to have a 2nd cup of coffee and this time something happened to the machine and I had to get someone to reboot it.    After an hour and a half of sitting in the freezing cold waiting area, I finally asked about the status of my car.  I was told it was being washed.  I asked the service adviser to please just bring me my car as I didn't need to have it washed.  The wash is just a run through a machine that scratches the paint anyway. I didn't want to spend another minute in that place.",1.0

33,"August 10, 2018","This has been my 3rd or 4th trip into the service center at Clear Lake after purchasing my car there - and at least while it has been under the warranty period, the service has been excellent.  Kind, professional, no surprises (okay, some surprises - like they wash my car before returning it to me and don't charge me for my first several oil changes), and fairly quick.  It is painless, too because their waiting area has wifi, nice spots at tables to sit and do work while I wait, and even coffee and popcorn.  This was my last service call under the warranty period, so I look forward to seeing if the trend continues.  I have tried to call to schedule the oil changes, but they always tell me to just stop in - they are always quick even when they say it could be an hour wait.... never happens.  ",5.0
34,"August 09, 2018","We bought a 2017 Forester from Clear Lake Subaru.  The car has been great for the last 2 years, except for a bad battery covered in warranty.  The dealership on the other hand has been a nightmare.  The car has been in for routine maintenance 4 times, the battery once, and a tire once.  Every occasion has been xxxx.  For example, after coming in on time for an appointment to have the battery replaced, that took 2-1/2 hours!  To replace a frickin' battery.  When I arrived they said 45 minutes tops, so I decided to wait on the car.  After an hour they said ""almost ready"".  That kept up for 2-1/2 hours.

On the latest occasion we took it in for routine maintenance (24K service).  We got the car back and noticed on the way home that they had not properly replaced an access panel underneath, which was dragging.  We immediately returned to the dealership to have them re-attach it.  What freakin' mechanic is so sloppy that he doesn't put everything back together?  Especially something so obvious in front of him?  It makes me wonder and worry what else might have been left half done.  Did they remember to tighten the oil drain plug, for example?  Sloppy, sloppy work--and it has been like that on every visit.  Further, I spoke to the general manager at Clear Lake Subaru about it.  He blamed the problem on ""poorly-engineered fasteners used by Subaru.""  Bull crap.  They are standard, easy-to-use fasteners found on most every car and motorcycle.  The real problem is sloppiness by his staff, but he refused to acknowledge it or bring it to their attention.  SUBARU:  You need to dump this dealership.

On another occasion we brought it in for to have a damaged tire replaced.  THEY KEPT THE CAR NEARLY TWO WEEKS TO CHANGE A TIRE!!!  They didn't stock the tire for the car they sold, so had to order it in from Minnesota or somewhere.  Then they had to ship it off again to have it shaved down to match the wear on the other tires.  THAT IS RIDICULOUS!  If you are going to sell these stupid full-time all-wheel drive vehicles (that have to have their tires shaved or all four replaced at once), then get the shaving machine in house.  Or at least one to share in Houston.

This dealership is a part of the Lithia group of dealers.  So beware the rest of them.  They may all have rejects for mechanics and managers.

The reason the warning light wasn't on at the test drive is because it was reset prior to the drive.

She also went an extra step, driving to my home to have my wife, who is partially handicapped, sign the necessary paperwork.  She made me feel like family.

Courtney handled the financial paperwork quickly and smoothly, making it an easy process.

203,"October 16, 2017"," Subaru of Clear Lake and Subaru of America have consistently  disappointed me since I purchased a vehicle from them on April 10, 2017. I tried for months to collect $290.40 from them for a Equity Shield Service Contract (Dent & Ding) and received no results, My first attempt of rating them on Car Dealer did not work. Car Dealer web site had prevented me from expressing any opinion about this dealership until now.

Also I wonder why Subaru chose to ignore my complaint to the Better Business Bureau, made on 9/20/17. Here's a summary of the issues. Casey Newton, GM at the time I bought my vehicle, stated to me in an email on 4/18/17 that he would see to it that the  (1) service contract warranty,(2) Lifetime oil package and(3) Equity Shield Maintenance Agreement (Dent & Ding) would all be cancelled as I requested. Within a reasonable amount of time the first two (extended warranty & Lifetime Oil Change) packages were credited to my Chase Subaru account. The date for these first two refunds are on 6/12/17 for $1,900 and on  6/05/17 for $849 Lifetime Oil. The third warranty, the Maintenance Agreement (Dent & Ding) was the exception where I have never received  a full refund at all. Forms had been filled out for all three packages on 5/02/17, with help from Andrew Spence. I signed a form for all three on 5/02/17. Sometime around 7/22/17 Mr. Spence sent me a separate form for the Equity Shield (Dent & Ding) and told me the wrong form had been used and that he had discussed the issue with Safe-Guard, in Atlanta. Per Andrew's request I was told to backdate the new form to May 25, 2017. Andrew stated that Safe-Guard said we could back date the form back to then so I wouldn't get a pro-rated refund. I started a dialog with Tony Huynh of Subaru of America on around 7/25/17, expressing concern about not receiving refund for Dent & Ding. In early August Andrew Spence emailed me and said he had check with Equity Shield and stated they had cancelled the Dent & Ding (Equity Shield) agreement. On 8/14/17 I did receive a refund of $308.60, which I did not notice until 8/21/17. The refund to my Chase account of $308.60 was $290.40 short of what it should have been. On 8/25/17  Hurricane Harvey made landfall in Houston. Subaru of Clear Lake was forced to close after Hurricane Harvey hit. On 8/31/17 I sent Andrew Spence an email stating I had only received a partial refund. I realize that Subaru of Clear Lake was closed and only reopened on 9/11/17. On 9/13/17 I called Safe-Guard in Atlanta to ask why my refund was short $290.40. I spoke with a woman named Kim (at Safe Guard) who told me that the refund was pro-rated but that it should be a refund of $513.37. Kim told me that my request was prorated due to fact that it was not timely, she also told me that only Subaru of Clear Lake accounting could tell Chase bank what to credit to my account. After my conversation with Kim at Safe Guard I called Subaru of Clear Lake and asked to speak with Leland Thompson, who was the new GM. (Leland had phoned me on 8/02/17 during the period the dealership was closed and told me he was going to look into my refund issue). I was told Leland, the GM was in a meeting and asked if I wanted to speak with Tim Spokony, Finance Manager. I related all the above issues that I've stated here to Tim and he asked me to give him a few days to sort this issue out. He explained the hurricane had disrupted the dealership. I had also been trying to communicate with Subaru of America but was told they could not help him with this issue. I filed a complaint with the Better Business of Houston on 9/20/17 and Subaru Clear Lake chose not to respond to it. On 10/12/17 Better Business Bureau of Houston notified me they had closed my complaint since 20 days had lapsed without any contact from Subaru of Clear Lake. In my complaint to BBB of Houston I had asked that Subaru of Clear give a refund of the full amount of $599.00. It's unfortunate that Subaru Clear Lake dealership consistently behaved in a careless manner concerning follow-up with the refund, and chose not to ever follow-up with me either.   ",3.6

I honestly did... I finally called Subaru of Clear Lake and spoke with a salesman named Michael Redmond.. This salesman went above and beyond his job from giving me knowledge on auto loans, leasing a vehicle, interest rates, and so on... we conversed for so long that I was going to consider him family... ( thats just me playing )... Well. this dealership ended up being a blessing after a long nightmare of mom and pop dealerships not reporting my credit, making it nearly impossible to get a vehicle I simply liked, after a nightmare of being told I only qualify for one or two cars on a lot of 200... I came to Subaru of Clear Lake and I was thinking it would be another chapter to my nightmare... But no there was direct assistance from the finance department that put in their all to get me approved.. Mr Redmond was committed to place me in a car that was nice and affordable... this assistance I received could go on for another 3 sentences. . Today I have a awesome 2013 Malibu, great mileage, great body, maybe not a Subaru, but a great car none the less... On their lot I seen all the cars offered that they have Subaru's and not... all nice.. and their first time buyers choices are awesome good cars, nice ones... I appreciate this dealership... a blessing after a nightmare... thank you .. and thank u Mr. Michael Redmond.",5.0

Tim was our miracle worker. Those gentlemen are a fantastic introduction to the Subaru family.

The service department continues the high standards of service. When you pull up to service, a large garage door opens & you pull into an air conditioned service area. You never have to walk around your car explaining what service you need in the hot sun or exposed to the Texas temperamental weather.

They have a nice comfortable waiting area with cell phone chargers, TV , snacks, juice, coffee, and tea. They also have an enclosed play area for small children with a TV playing children's cartoons & programming. I like that this Subaru considers refreshments for your well behaved pets as well (some dog snacks & a water bowl). If you're so inclined they have a cut out window in the parts department where you can watch your vehicle being serviced.

He went above and beyond, always checking to see if my experience went well. I never had any of the typical pressure from a car dealership. Non of the ""let me talk to my manager"" bull.

I met with Manuel Calvillo, told him what I had an interest in and, as he pulled up available units on his computer, discovered that he actually lived in the same neighborhood.  Jokingly, I said ""good, then you can drive me over to the dealership when my car is ready for pick-up"".  Without hesitation he said, ""I sure will"".  That is actually what happened today.
I was also impressed that he communicated throughout the process advising what information he would need in advance so that when I came in, I had brought everything needed and the process went through with minimum delay as a result of his foresight.  I also enjoyed meeting other staff members and was impressed with the walking tour of the facility that Manuel conducted as a part of his sales role.  The visit concluded with his sitting with me in the new car and reviewing the MANY technology features which were totally foreign to me coming from a fourteen year old model.  Once I felt confident that I had a basic understanding, we said goodbye but he repeatedly let me know that he was available to answer any questions post sale.  ",5.0
318,"April 28, 2017","I haven't shopped for a vehicle in years...decades, but it was time to start looking. I arrived at the facility and looked around and never was pressured by any salesman/woman as I was looking. As I was almost to my car I noticed a salesman coming from the car lot and I looked over and we both said hi. We had a conversation not involving cars right off the bat and then I told him I was looking at a Crosstrek and gave him the one I saw on the dealership site. He pulled it up and I took a test drive. I told him I was in the beginning stages of looking and was looking at another brand vehicle. I left that day feeling good about the Crosstrek and was leaning toward this vehicle. Bradley never pressured me in my decision thinking. He gave me facts and ratings about the Crosstrek, but never sugarcoated his words. I felt comfortable in the facility and when I called him a few days later and told him I wanted to test drive it again he was helpful and patient with me as I still was undecided. I can say I am a PROUD Subaru owner and I want to thank Bradley Stereff for all his help, knowledge and guidance to help me with my new car experience.

331,"April 19, 2017","After hunting for 2 months on Craigslist, going to area's around the city, checking out over 12 SUVs. I was getting tired of reading 'no problems' and then show up and hear 'except for this or that problem', I thought, "" The year I want , 1997-2004, is going to be just so worn out to purchase with my limited funds and be able to drive it without extensive repairs.""
 All the vehicles I had seen were leaking fluids from either the motor or transmission or the power steering. Some were so bad I didn't even test drive them. One actually started pouring the radiator fluid onto the ground while we were looking under the hood! Yet, I stuck to it for one more search.When my Craigslist search came across the exact year (1998) I was looking for, being sold by a bonifid dealer, not the small dealers I'd been seeing and it was in my price range ! I had to take a second look and read all the post to realize it really was being sold at Subaru of Clear Lake.
 I was surprised a lower cost vehicle would be at a serious car dealer. I called and got in touch with Rey Hernandez. He looked up the SUV and told me he'd call back as soon as he put his hands on it. He called within 10 minutes and said yes its there and its looking very well cared for. I was very excited but cautious after so many people trying to sell me their junk. I asked him to take a picture under the motor and he sent me 3 pics of no oil dripping. I told him I'd come the next day. 
He turned me over to Manuel Calvillo , his colleague, because he would be off the next day, introducing him to me as Manny. I thought of a movie I'd seen with my grandson, Manny the Moody Mammoth! Made him smile when i told him. He was not moody by the way! Just as patient as can be.
 Manny is a pleasant young man and really was so patient with me as I test drove it and worried over the purchase price and as I picked at it. No pressure selling, just alert and ready to make that deal. I even left to go eat lunch to think about. Their manager Joe Nabors came out to shake my hand and make sure I was being taken care of. It was very nice to meet the boss.
 They didn't lie to me, it has a very nice interior and the paint on this 19 year old SUV is like new. Manny was doing everything he could to make my purchase smooth and hassle free. So driving home to my family and friends made me look like I know how to buy a car!

He told me to bring the car that day and they would take of it without an appointment. Not only did they replace the battery they also went ahead and serviced the vehicle so I did not have to bring it back in on the originally schedule appointment day.

After seeing positive reviews online and hearing them from my family (a bunch of car enthusiasts), I took my business to Subaru of Clear Lake. I was immediately greeted with sincerity and pleasantness, something I was not expecting from a car dealership. The showroom was impeccably clean and everyone had a smile on their face.  

Joe was very welcoming and hospitable. Through the sales process, he checked in on me to make sure that everything was going smoothly and that my experience was nothing short of exceptional. His pleasantness was reassuring and appreciated.

Martin took exceptional care of me as a customer and guest in his workplace. He gave clear, detailed explanations of all my options, was incredibly knowledgeable on the different vehicles I looked at, spoke honestly about the process, and made recommendations based on my lifestyle and financial standing. He made sure that my final decision was one that was both manageable and satisfying for me.

419,"November 18, 2016","WHO-Robbie Dominguez, awesome salesman with knowledgeable info on the Subaru line with absolutely no PRESSURE. His approach sealed WHERE I would by my car from. Now I just had to decide which one, not easy after driving a pickup for 30yrs. He asked questions to better understand my personal needs and wants in a vehicle. I test drove the BRZ which is Fabulously Fun.  I test drove the WRX, wicked handling and acceleration.  Both had smoother steering than other cars I had tried. I went home with lots of info and a decision to make.  I am picky and want what I want and knew I wouldn't be making this choice without some thought. 

WHAT- I purchased the 2017 Legacy Limited 3.6. Due to Robbie's easy going nature I felt comfortable going online and researching the other models Subaru has to offer and focused  on what mattered to me most. So a few days later I went back with husband in tow and we test drove the 2017 Legacy Limited 3.6 and knew we found the right fit! Car is loaded with great safety features, bling and does not hesitate to bring on the muscle when needed, with lots of room to boot. The price definitely made it an easy choice as well.

WHY- Clear Lake Subaru-I have happily driven pickups for 30 yrs and thought it was time for a car.  With so many to choose from I found myself looking to see which one stood out and what mattered most. After seeing a Subaru commercial with a strong message of what the car looked like and how occupants survived after an accident my decision was pretty much made on the brand I was most interested in.  The Team at Clear lake Subaru was courteous, knowledge and work well TOGETHER to give this customer a great car buying experience! I was able to get most of financing details handled over the phone which save lots of time when it came time to pick up my car.  Did I 
mention I am picky?  They happily and quickly found the car that had all I desired. Tim Spokony in financing worked to get the best deal possible for US , yes even hubby was smiling.  Great Job, Robbie and Team and we will definitely recommend you to any we know that is looking for a hassle free car buying experience!
Note- Survey asked if we were left alone for more than five minutes.  We were but only after being greeted and presence acknowledge by Robbie who was finishing up with another customer. We happily waited while looking over, sitting in the pertinent cars in the showroom and lot without feeling smothered by any other salesman. That was nice and Robbie was with us shortly.",5.0

The car I looked at and the car I ended up getting were different cars, but he worked out such a good deal that it wasn't horrible to get a higher end model. And no I get all the bells and whistles. I'm super enjoying the new car, and feel amazing about the deal. I felt like i wasn't pressured, and he left me alone to talk to over with my mom which gave us the ability to talk with each other honestly without a car dealer overhearing and trying to talk us into something.

441,"October 23, 2016","This was by far the best experience that I have ever had buying a car, and Courtney Morelle and the team at Subaru of Clear Lake are the reason that happened!  We had been in the market for a car for my wife for some time. I had owned several Subaru's before and knew about their dependability; but I was dealer weary from bad experiences with other car dealers.  But from the very beginning Courtney Morelle with Subaru of Clear Lake proved to be outstanding, even as I requested quotes from the 5 Subaru dealers in Houston.  She was the only one that took me seriously and did not mind responding to my request.  They were the furthest dealer from us but because of her response  we drove the 45 miles and it was well worth the trip.  Miss Courtney Morelle, was kind and humble, and she treated me with respect.  We corresponded via email and I told her what we were looking for and then set up an appointment.  When we arrived she was already waiting for us and she was very cordial.  Courtney sat next to my wife in the car and explained where everything was and how it  functioned, and what she might expect.  She is very knowledgeable and patient.  In short we were so impressed with the way this dealership encourages their employees to treat their customers, so much so that we ended buying two cars, one for my wife and one for me.
Courtney and the whole team at Subaru of Clear Lake, restored faith in us toward the whole process of buying a new car.   There were no hassles, no haggling, no hidden angles, everything black and white, and on paper, for all to see.
I encourage anyone wanting to buy a car, to seriously consider a Subaru, and when doing that consider buying it from Subaru of Clear Lake, ask for Courtney Morelle, she will truly make your car buying experience a joy.

I did my research and concluded that Subaru was the best car for me based on reliability and how much people I talked to loved them. I came in to this dealership and I will admit, I was very stand of fish when I started talking to Dallas. But that started to where off when I could see the passion he had for Subaru and how friendly he was to me.

I've purchased three cars in my life and I can tell you that I was expecting your normal, run of the mill, pushy car salesman who wont let you leave until you are driving away in a brand new car. This wasn't that. I went in and met with Rick Erwin, I told him exactly what I was looking for and he showed me couple of models but made it clear that they did not have what I was looking for but would have the cars 5 days later. We went through the numbers and I told him to get the cars and we will look at them when they got to the dealership. 5 days later we head over there, love the cars, sign the paperwork and drive home.

What I liked about the dealership was the employees that I dealt with. The salesman was not pushy and didn't try to sell me something I didn't want.

451,"October 15, 2016","I want to rate this car buying experience as the best ever! From the moment I entered the showroom to the time I signed the contract, I felt as if I was spending my money with a dealership that cared. I want to specifically mention Robbie Dominguez as an exemplary employee of Clear Lake.  He alone restored my faith in the car buying experience. I walked into a Gilman Subaru dealership early Monday morning to test drive a Cross Trek and for about 25 minutes I felt invisible. One employee asked,""Why I was there?"". However, no one else ever came to talk to me. I followed up with an email to the dealership and spoke to the sales manager on the phone about the lack of good customer service. Later that evening, I went to Clear Lake.  I should also state that I had a $500 deposit on a Mazda CX-5 and my car broke down on the way to the dealership (so they had a highly motivated buyer) but they could not match the offer or service by Clear Lake. During this time, Robbie stayed in contact by emailing and answering all my questions. He was patient and professional. I will recommend this dealership and specifically Robbie Dominguez when purchasing a Subaru.  Finally, the first thing I do when purchasing a new car is remove all dealership advertising on the vehicle. However, because of the way I was treated by Robbie, I am electing to keep this information on my vehicle.  I am a proud new member of the Clear Lake family.

Clear Lake made the extra effort to get the car that was going to the other dealer so we could have what we wanted and when we needed it.

I was transferred to Bobby Parker and he was especially helpful with providing the information I was needing.

533,"July 26, 2016","Ok, this will be a good time for a review - lol ... ... I bought a new 2016 Crosstrek about 4 months ago, fully loaded, cool eco color, nice little fuel efficient vehicle, pleasure to drive (a little annoying in traffic when it interrupts my acceleration per some kind of safety system), but overall nice driving platform.  
That said ...
I was a little disappointed with Subaru's options regarding hitch assemblies, sizes, prices and the cost of accessories as compared to other ""quality"" products and systems on the market (like two and a half times the cost for Subaru's smaller and less diverse product line).
Then
Over the weekend - we started to leave in the Subaru and while adjusting the rearview mirror on the windshield, the glass behind the neck simply disintegrated, spidering slightly, and then grew over the next few hours till the next morning there was a interior crack from top to bottom of the windshield.  I'm not that young a man and I've never seen any vehicle in my day 'ever' do anything like this before ... I do understand the concepts of wear and tear, nails in tires, and rock chips to glass due to normal usage ...and understand thats not covered in typical warranties... no problem... but ... big 'but' ... I don't see this particular event as being wear and tear (especially not after only four months) ... also talking to two people at the dealership that agreed with me in regards to this.  Regardless, dealership management made the decision that the formal guidelines of the warranties do not cover glass and therefore it's 'my' problem not theirs.  In conclusion I have to then find that the public should be aware that Subaru in general may no longer be a company that utilizes ""quality"" products in the manufacturing of their lines of vehicles and that we (the public) should keep this theory in mind before the purchase of said products.  
I won't say anything critical about their customer service skills as they were very nice about the way they said ""no"".  lol

536,"July 22, 2016","Alright! So, after 6 mos of worry free ownership, I decided I wanted to try and trade up from my current 2016 WRX Limited to a new 2017 WRX Limited with the HK sound system, push button start, and most importantly, the blind side and cross traffic warning system. So, I texted Courtney Morelle and explained what I was thinking. She texted back and asked for some info. I gave her my pay off and told her exactly which car I was interested in. She texted back within a few hours after she met with the finance manager and the sales manager. Unbelievably, she said they could make a deal happen on the new car without much issue. They were able to pay off my current ride WITH positive equity and applied the equity into the new car. I went in for the test drive and as much as I LOVED the 2017 with all the great options, I just wasn't sure I wanted to start over on my payments which would be an additional $30/month. So, I told Courtney I was going to sleep on it. She said cool but asked if I would talk to the GM first. I said sure. He was super nice and asked what it would take to get me to purchase the car that day. I told him I loved the car and the price was great, I just wasn't sure I could justify starting over in my payments for a few options that I simply ""wanted"" but didn't ""need"". His response? ""What if I can put you in the new car at the same monthly payment as you have now?"" I said for sure. 10 mins later, I'm signing paper work on a car a year newer with every option available at the same monthly payment. Done deal! No tricks. No bait and switch. Honest, straight forward, and up front. I drove out of there with the exact car I should've bought 7 mos ago. As I said before, I'll bring my entire family here for all our new cars!!

A manual transmission was the most important thing to me. Its my fault, I should have waited and I should done a larger search radius while looking for the Impreza I wanted. Needless to say Im a bit angry, especially since the Impreza Sports withe the manual I found were almost 5000K cheaper because they dont have the moonroof, eyesight and their horrible ""INFOTAINMENT touch screen that doesnt even come with NAV! I though I would make an appeal to them to see if this could be corrected, 4 days after I bought this car, 200 miles on it, the manager Casey Newton
tells me that they're willing to take the car back as a trade in, giving me exactly $4,700.00 less then I just paid 4 days prior! Does that sound like a fair deal?!!!! 

I will never go back into this dealership! I suggest all potential buyers stay away from these people!  ",1.0

665,"March 24, 2016",I'm a combat engineer specialist in the US Army. I Found the car I wanted while looking online. At first I didn't mind the distance the dealership was from me. I called a week ahead and talked to Luis a salesman and scheduled a date to go in and look at the car. On the day I arrived the car was not clean and looked like it had been sitting out for a good month. After test driving the vehicle I notice there was a leak of transmission fluid which apparently was just a loose hose. Now this was and is the car I have always wanted so we started talking prices. Over the phone I disguised a price I was willing to go but in once I was at the dealership that price was no longer available. When talking there was no negotiating the price after hours of being there I was not happy and was about to walk out till I decided that I didn't want to leave the car I wanted for a long time so I bit the bullet and bought it. Once I drove the car off the lot I notice the horn didn't work which I needed at the time so I called Luis and he told me to come back the next day. Even though it was a drive I did and the next day the service members wont expecting me. they looked at the car and saw the horn wasn't working which is what I told them. Now they inform me they have to order the part and to come next week. which I did once that was fixed I went back home(a 4 hour drive) and there is where I saw there was a leak again. this time it was with the power steering and instead of going to clear lake again I took it to Austin Subaru dealership which was a huge chance way better service they gave me a rental car till the problem was fixed. the problem was the rack and pinon which was replaced. The car has been fine ever since till today a month later when I got a call asking if I could come in because there was a problem getting my license plates and need to do an inspection. Now this should have been done before selling the car in the first place so now I have to get the inspection and fax it to them and if it doesn't pass then I don't now my next step to take. I Love my WRX it is a joy to have. I waited till I was 22 and had good credit to purchase this vehicle and once coming back from my first deployment I was able to afford it. However I would not recommend anyone to go through the dealership of clear lake to purchase anything. ,1.4

739,"January 21, 2016","I recently went in to buy a new car on December 18, 2015 at Clear Lake Subaru. It was 8:30pm when I arrived and was greeted by Jacob Lopez. I explained to him that I was interested in the 2016 WRX or STI.  
I test drove the WRX and it lacked the power that I was looking for. I, then, wanted to test drive the STI and was told that I had to get my credit checked prior to doing so. I haven't bought many cars before, but it sounded odd that they needed my credit report for just a test drive. Anyway, the test drive went well and loved the STI. The only thing that I did not like was the color. I wanted a white car, but they did not have one at this particular dealership. 
Jacob, then, introduced me to Dallas Hardwick. Dallas was the main sales representative that handled the negotiation process with me. I explained to Dallas that I would not negotiate unless I could get a white STI. He promised me that they would have one brought over by tomorrow morning from another dealership as long as we finished negotiating that night. I trusted his word and we negotiated until we came upon an agreement. I do not have many great things to say, but I will say that he gave me more money for my trade in than I thought I was going to get. We also agreed that I could use my trade in as collateral (deposit) until the next morning; when I will be receiving my new car.
Dallas told me that I will be receiving a phone call in the morning, around 9 or 10, to come and pick up the car and finish the paperwork. The next morning, around 11, I finally called someone because I did not receive a phone call at all. I was told that they were “busy” and that is why no one had called me. They said that they were still working on getting a car from another dealership and it should be there before 5 pm (because they closed early that day, 12/19/2015). This was not a big deal, however, it was frustrating. I, then, called every hour until 4pm to make sure that they were doing their job. However, there was no progress made and it seemed as if they were avoiding me completely. Therefore, I drove to the dealership to see what was going on in person. When I arrived, both Jacob and Dallas were busy with other customers, so I spoke to Thomas Woods, the sales manager. Tom informed me that they could not make a trade from another dealership. He said that I have two options: buy the STI that I test drove, which was silver, or wait until the white STI from the factory comes in on January 13th. The benefit to waiting was that he promised me that it would have “absolutely ZERO miles” on it. He also said that the car would have the same packages and have the same deal (price) that Dallas and I had negotiated the night prior. I agreed to wait because, to me, having the color car that I want is extremely important. Before I left, I had to put a $500 deposit to reserve the new car and to get my old car back until it came in. Also, I made sure to receive a copy of the negotiation contract for my records. 
One good thing that this dealership did was get my car in earlier than promised; Five days early (January 8, 2015). 
When I went in to finalize the contract, I found out that the car had nine miles on it. Not “absolutely ZERO” like promised. You may think that I am being nitpicky, but the STIs motor has a very sensitive break-in period that I wanted to be in complete control of. I was informed, by Jacob, that three miles were because they have to do a post-delivery inspection to make sure everything was running. This included them driving it around the I-45 feeder ramps which is a three-mile circle. Another three miles were on there from the pre-delivery inspection done by the Subaru factory. Neither one of these things would have been a problem if I were told beforehand and would have been expecting it. 
Before we went to the finance department to finalize purchasing, we sat down with Jacob to make sure the negotiation contract was correct. It was not. Unfortunately for Subaru, I remembered to bring my copy of the contract we had agreed upon and signed. I was not receiving the same trade in value as previously agreed on, the taxes were not aligning, the discount was not the same, the monthly payment was higher, and the adjusted price was wrong. We had to sit for an hour before Tom came out and finally decided to match what I had on my original contract. During this hour, I was on credit karma on my phone because I was alerted about another credit check. In this hour, they had done three more hard credit checks in addition to the one done back in December for the test drive. When I asked why this was happening, I was given the answer of, “I don’t know.” Jacob had nothing to do with this. He was just the middle man and I do not blame him. However, I am angry and disappointed because it seemed as if they were trying to pull a fast one on me. When I asked Tom about why they did not have my contract correct in the first place he informed me that they had “lost” it. I know this to be incorrect because there is no way they could have gotten close to the numbers agreed on without having something to reference. 
While fixing these errors, Dallas came over and grabbed the keys and said that he was going to fill up the car with gas. I assumed they had a fuel pump on site, but when I saw him drive off the lot I wanted to know where he was going. Jacob informed me that they get gas from the Shell right by the dealership. This added another 3 miles to the odometer. Not only that, but there was no telling how he was driving the car on the way to the pump. You are not supposed to exceed 4,000 RPMs in any gear. This is hard to do on the feeder of I-45, even when being careful. I do not understand why that was not done during the post-delivery inspection in order to keep the mileage as low as possible. 
In summary, I had a terrible car buying experience. When my family is ready for a Subaru this coming March, I cannot wait to drive passed Subaru of Clear Lake on my way to the Sugarland or Katy dealership. I also sent my buddy to the Subaru in Sugarland where he purchased his WRX. His car buying experience was much better than mine. 
Pros:
Jacob Lopez is a great middle man and very helpful. 
More money for my trade in than expected.
Car arrived sooner than expected. 

Cons:
Everything else.

And, subaru of clear lake is hands down one of the friendliest and most honest place you can go. We are now on our second subaru and love everything about it here. When our old one would get serviced here it was never a struggle to get anything done, and we never felt like we were being misled or cheated in any way.

It was followed by e-mail contact with Dallas Hardwick. This dealer does not play the ""Bring us the lowest price you get and we will try to beat it."" game. Once the price was agreed on, we completed the cash purchase in 2 hours on same day.

Dealership is clean, spacious and well maintained..Customer lounge is bright and well stock with soft drinks, coffee, fruites and snacks. Everyone acted professionally and treated us with respect.. After initial inspection and test drive, our car went through final touches while we completed the paperwork.  Finally, Dallas spent a lot of time to go through features in the car, even sync up my wife's phone with Subaru Starlink. He followed up with a phone call a few days later to check on our car purchase experience. 

Team we interacted with in this purchase:

Dallas Hardwick -  Sales
Joshua Mitchell - Sales Manager
Tom Woods - Sales Manager
Tony Rodrigguez - Finance

Overall, an excellent and highly satisfied purchase experience working with a professional team at Subaru of Clear Lake.

760,"December 31, 2015","We had an extraordinary car-buying experience at Subaru of Clear Lake—worthy of an Exceptionally High Commendation !  

I expected a lot of haggling, unnecessary gamesmanship, a one-sided transaction mostly benefiting the dealership and the salesman…but instead, we got Dallas Hardwick who focused on my needs and wishes, and even arranged for us to have an extended test drive to ensure our garage could fit the Outback.  Dallas’s friendly tone didn’t end with the consummation of the sale, but continued till he turned the keys over to us.  At all times we were left with the feeling that Dallas would be our premier advocate to get a fair deal and the best service, which we got in spades starting with Tom Woods—who impressed me as a very effective, engaged manager and role model.  Tom set the cultural tone that got us into the buying mood.  Tom allayed our concerns about the distance from our home to your dealership by simply telling us that “the best is yet to come” beyond the purchase from Subaru of Clear Lake; we’re looking forward to that.  Our great experience extended also to Joshua Mitchell and Tony Rodriquez who ensured we got everything we needed to be happy with the car we just purchased; this convinced us that the excellence of Subaru of Clear Lake is solid to the core.

All in all, we would highly recommend Subaru of Clear Lake to all our friends with our full conviction.

765,"December 24, 2015","Hello everyone! Let me start by saying: I'm 39 y/o, male, perfect credit, and I knew EXACTLY the car I wanted. So, as I usually do, I started by emailing every Subaru dealer from Houston to San Antonio. 2 never got back to me and 1 didn't have the car I wanted. This left 2: Subaru of Clear Lake and Gillman. Both were equally respectful over the email correspondence I received and both were straight forward. However, upon hearing the deal Clear Lake offered me, Gillman said they couldn't even come close to matching it. So, after confirming the price with Courtney Morelle (the sales woman who was my point of contact), I left from work to go visit the dealership. In short, upon entering the facility, I was blown away but the bright, clean features of the place. Large, beautiful showroom, nice and open space. I didn't feel the typical pressure that typically comes from entering the ""lion's den"" so to speak. The receptionist was kind and put me in touch with Courtney immediately. I wasn't made to wait or feel like I was just a number. Courtney had 2 of the WRXs I was looking for side by side so I could compare packages. I was sold on the Limited, of which they only had 2 left. I opted for the red one. I went back inside with Courtney to do all the paperwork, credit check, etc. After about 20 mins, all the paperwork was in order and Courtney introduced me to the finance director, Tony Rodriguez. Tony was extremely straight forward and made crystal clear what charges were unavoidable and which ones were extra options or unnecessary. He was very kind and applied absolutely NO PRESSURE to sign the paperwork. He simply showed me all the options on the table. At this point, I thanked him for his time and told him I wanted to sleep on the sale and that if I chose to purchase after a good night's rest, I'd be back in the morning to take delivery. He was perfectly fine with this and encouraged me to think it over and come back when I was ready and felt good about it. The next morning, I came back with my wife, bought the car, insured it over the phone, and drove it home. I live in The Woodlands but when it's time for my next car, you can bet I'll be willing to drive the 90 mins it took to get to Clear Lake and purchase or lease my next Subaru!! I have a daughter who will be driving in the next few years and I would feel more than comfortable letting her walk in there and work a deal all on her own, as long as Courtney and Tony are part of the process!!

I worked with Chase Wilson over phone both in September as well as November. He was always very courteous,professional to the point and prompt in returning calls. We agreed on price and there was no surprises at the end. My first choice of color was pearl white and Katy dealership had that color and agreed on same price as Clear Lake.

He was knowledgeable, not pushy, never rushed me or made me feel guilty about driving and re-driving cars, and he continued to provide assistance even after he made the sell. He told me If I had any questions about how to operate the features in my new car or set-up anything he would be happy to assist me and he has followed through with that. Also, he never bothered me after I left the dealership to contemplate my options. He made himself available anytime I had questions but never called and asked me where I was at with my decision like so many of the other sales people I have dealt with lately.

Financing was a breeze! I was in his office for 15-20minutes max and then I was out the door with brand new outback minutes later. They made me aware of the extended warranties, service plans, and other options available but there was zero pressure to purchase any of them.  I really appreciated that!

 My wife and I went to Subaru of Clear Lake looking for a ""sporty but practical"" sedan. The salesman who assisted us initially, Robbie Dominguez was a tremendous help, guiding us to the Subaru WRX, which we hadn't really considered (though he happily let us test drive the BRZ we originally went to see as well).

I was pleasantly surprised when Robbie didn't try any of the usual strong arm tactics when we told him we weren't ready to purchase that day. When we returned a few days later with the whole family, he was knowledgeable, helpful, and patient. I explained that I didn't want to waste a lot of time hearing about credit insurance, etc. and I'm happy to report I didn't have to.

Yesterday we bought the car we wanted, at a price I felt was competitive, after almost no haggling back and forth. The whole process was about as smooth as I've experienced in two decades of buying cars. Everyone at the dealership was pleasant and professional, but Robbie Dominguez was the star. If you're in the market for a Subaru, head on out to this dealership and ask for him. ",4.8

I had briefly emailed back and fourth with Chase but I was late to my initial appointment timing so Dallas took over the sale once I got there.

Dallas was VERY knowledgeable on the Subaru's which I knew nothing about Subaru's so that was very important.

Moments later I was contacted by another dealership and I did the mistake of going to Gilman Subaru and test driving the sales person was rude there. So I contacted Chase again and he beat the offer that Gilman had told me for a brand new 2015 WRX. When I got to Clear Lake Subaru the color I had picked for the WRX was sold. But Chase gave me a option for another color. And he told me he would try to compensate for the color which did work out because I did receive some extra bonuses with the car. After me and chase filled out the paper work I was introduced to Ryan Wiseman. And at first I thought Ryan would be like a normal finance guy rude and eager to just get paper work done. But I was surprised. Ryan was the complete opposite he helped lower my APR to 1.9% and also worked out some more deals with me sat down and took his time to explain my payments and warranty options which I did end up getting. These two guys are probably the best people I have met while car shopping The process at this dealership was quick and simple with no hassle.

After shopping around other Subaru and non-Subaru dealerships in Houston, my wife and I chose to go with Subaru of Clear Lake because we felt most comfortable with how we were treated here.  Their customer service is simply excellent, as is their inventory—and the store itself is immaculate.  During our first visit, TAYLOR FUQUA helped us test drive two different vehicles and was very patient and knowledgeable and answered all our questions about Subarus in general (it was our first time driving one).  His enthusiasm and genuine interest in our purchase was crucial to our coming back to Clear Lake after experiences at other dealerships.

We felt we were able to negotiate a fair price and the finance/paperwork process was straightforward.  The icing on the cake, though, came after the purchase was complete.  We loved everything about our new Subaru Forester except for one issue.

After waiting 2 1/2 hours to get in to meet with Finance to sign the paperwork, we got tired of waiting and left.  The next day was another 2 hours going through the paperwork and car inspection and review process, only to find that it did not come equipped with the accessories we wanted and were told it would have.  We left.  Again.  And without the car until they got the accessories installed.  

The sales staff are very inexperienced and do not understand the importance of delivering an efficient and positive customer experience.  One Finance person writing contracts is not sufficient when you have more than one customer buying a car.  

I can't speak for the Service Dept here, but lack confidence in its ability to meet the Subaru service standards based upon our buying experience.

Suggestion to Management:  Ensure staff who answer the phone know all employee names.  When we called and asked for our sales rep by phone, we were told there is no one there by that name.  Also, when customers come into the dealership, the receptionist who sits at the entrance should do whatever it takes to determine why the customer is there and to connect them with the appropriate person who can help them.  We went to the dealership 5 times in 3 days and not once did the receptionist attempt to get us connected with the person we needed to see who could help us.",2.5

His enthusiasm about Subaru products was contagious and within 20 minutes I was ready to buy - even before my wife.  That happens very seldom because I'm a hard-sell, and that it happened at all speaks to an extraordinarily high level of professionalism and courtesy shown by Subaru's staff during every step in the process.

874,"August 21, 2015","My wife and I have owned three Subaru's. We bought two Outback's from McRee Subaru about 5 years ago and really enjoyed the experience. But, that dealership has since closed its doors. The Impreza/WRX from Gillman was an okay buying experience. But their handling of warranty service just about turned us completely away from Subaru forever. 

Recently, however, we decided to take a chance on Subaru of Clear Lake and are so glad we did! They’ve only been open a few months. We made an appointment with Courtney M., who took care of us throughout our visit. The dealership is large and inviting. Courtney offered us snacks and drinks which we opted for later in our car buying experience. (Try buying a car on an empty stomach! That just doesn’t work very well if you’re at the dealership several hours browsing and dealing.) Courtney showed us several Subaru models to compare between to help narrow our search. She knew quite a bit about each. She was also very familiar with the dealer inventory and took us directly to several specific vehicles we wanted to look closer.    

Courtney was very easy to work with when we finally sat down to talk numbers. Over the years, we've had the displeasure of dealing with salespeople/dealerships that went back on their word, changed numbers, added fees without transparency, and were downright insulting. We've walked out before—once, at the very end of a deal! However, Courtney and the Clear Lake Staff were very respectful and professional. We would have liked to get a little more for our trade; but Courtney made up on the new car price, financing, and extras. We pick up the 2016 Outback at the end of the week.

We liked the buying experience so much, we came back a few days later to talk to Courtney about another new vehicle. She was, again, very pleasant, friendly, and helpful. The facility was just as clean and inviting. As our visit was shorter in duration than our first, we instead snuck a treat for the dog! (Subaru is big on pets, and this dealership offers complimentary milk bones—mostly for the pets of owners!) Rather than tour the new car lot again, and for time savings and convenience, Courtney drove to the front of the building a few vehicles we were interested in seeing. We’re still deciding between an XV Crosstrek and an Impreza that’s currently in transit. 

One more positive for the dealership: They have a separate drive area and staff to assist owners who need vehicle maintenance/service. For those who want to stay and wait for their vehicles, and/or for those who are curious, there’s a comfortable sitting area that offers huge glass window views of the entire service area. For both visits, the garage was orderly and clean—a good sign that the dealership is organized, doesn’t hide the shop, and is Safety conscious.

In our case, there was an extra dose of patience and, in case I didn't stress ""patience"" in bold type,  both Taylor and Manuel dished it in droves.   We purchased two new Subarus.  Extraordinary considering we came to Clear Lake ""just looking"" at pre-owned autos.  Not one iota of buyer's remorse.  Great job guys...thanks! ",5.0
879,"August 16, 2015","First lets start with I am a female and have recently felt like I was being taken advantage of at other dealerships.
That is NOT the case at Clear Lake Subaru.
I had briefly emailed back and fourth with Chase but I was late to my initial appointment timing so Dallas took over the sale once I got there. I had seen and been interested in 3 used vehicles that I wanted to take a look at. 1 was a Honda and 2 were Subaru's. He brought out both of the Subaru's for me to be able to compare the differences. Dallas was VERY knowledgeable on the Subaru's which I knew nothing about Subaru's so that was very important. He went over the differences in Subaru AWD and other makes AWD, the engine and all the features about each Subaru. We took the one I liked the most out on a test drive, loved it!
What really made the difference is Josh Mitchell the Sales Manager, he came with the attitude of what do we need to do to for you to buy this car. Seems simple but Soutwest Gillman Subaru lost my business because they wouldn't work with me on just about anything. 
But back to Josh he was a great, never made me feel over pressured, felt very comfortable which ultimately what prompt me to go ahead and buy the car right then and there. Ultimately he didn't push me into anything but offered me what I needed to make it happen. 
And Ryan went over all the actual paperwork and he was very nice despite it being after 10pm when actually making the purchase.
So far I love my Subaru, and I love the service I received at Clear Lake Subaru and I 100% would refer friends here for a easy experience. Who knows when its time to upgrade hopefully I can get my new Subaru with them again. 

Thank you for making the experience so easy, it made a world of difference. The difference is what sold me the car. ",5.0

Our sales rep was Courtney who, you would never know, was just finishing her second week as a salesperson. She did a very professional, comprehensive job.

889,"August 01, 2015","I started my 5 week car buying experience with Lithia Subaru of clear lake attempting to purchase a WRX STI which was priced at 34,000. When I tried to negotiate a price they never thought about lowering their price, just trying to find ways to make me pay the sticker price. I was told there's no such thing as a Cash price or a Finance price as he ran my credit to try and scam me into financing. The salesman wouldn't drive the car and only ran the car for a few minutes. So I left and fast-forward 2 weeks later I drive from Matagorda to Houston after work, to attempt to purchase this car AGAIN asking 29,000 CASH at which point I was told the car was just sold and I had the pleasure of watching the new owner drive off with the car I had been waiting to buy. So at this point I was ready to take my money else where and the salesman Dallas told me to wait because they have another car that was for sale for 32,000 so I begin negotiating, I say 28,000 expecting a counter offer... I never received a counter offer, I received INSTEAD an offer to trade in my Subaru (which they severely undervalued) to PAY FULL PRICE FOR THE CAR. why would anyone pay full price for a used car? I thought I was buying a used 2014 car not a brand new 2016 car. As I was leaving I was left with this parting message from Dallas himself; ""we sell Subarus, not Fords or Chevys we don't give 10,000 rebates we sell cars that last"" at which point I should have retorted with ""I own a Subaru which you valued as a 2005 Ford, so I guess I'll be heading over to the Ford dealership to get the real value of my car"". Total waste of time, inexperienced salesman and finance department, only way you'll leave with a car is if you accept their finance prices which are astronaumical. Don't waste your time.",1.4

He was very welcoming and wasted no time in walking my vehicle with me addressing all of the issues I needed to have looked at.  I explained to him that I was told by that other dealership (West Houston) that my maintenance period on the car was up - I was only at 23,600 miles.  He did some research and informed me I still had complimentary maintenance owed to me and that my oil service would be free.  My extended arm rest broke months ago (within a month of me having it installed) and he asked politely if he might look through my center console.   After giving him permission, he managed to find the screws for the armrest and had them installed again for me.  I could not have asked for better service!!!

First, you do not have numerous people running up to you while you browse. I had an idea of what kind of car I wanted, and was thankful that I was able to walk around and not be harassed. Once I decided that I wanted the 2015 WRX STI, I found a nice representative to work with. Karina Martinez went above and beyond to make sure that we were happy. Although this dealership is only three months old, she was incredibly knowledgable about the cars and services. Karina went on to give us her personal cell phone number and said that we could call her at any time, even 4 A.M., if we ever had any questions. I did purchase an extended warranty and she reassured us that if we needed the car serviced or had any general questions to give her a call. I was happy to work with Karina throughout the whole experience. Ryan Wiseman was incredible. Ryan is the financial manager at Subaru and helped us through the car loan process. There were some bumps in the road, but Ryan made sure that we were taken care of. Between Ryan Wiseman and Casey Newton, the loan process which is usually a head ache with lots of paper work and time, went relatively smoothly and timely. Buying a new car is a huge decision.

dance stuff that goes on when someone is going to purchase a car. I have already recommended this
dealership to several of my co-workers, and now that I know how buying a car experience should be

We appreciated the honesty followed by his willingness to find out the information we needed.  The drive was so smooth, interior comfortable and roomy, and we liked the all wheel drive feature.

1013,"March 17, 2015","TL;DR:
I could not realistically ask for a better car buying experience than the one I got. It was awesome!

The long version:
I was looking to buy a new car after my 8 year old crossover suv with almost 200K miles on it died from a fried computer. I had done some research on Subaru and they looked like good vehicles for the money. I came to the dealership with a good idea of what I wanted.

I looked around the lot and met Dallas close to the door. Dallas is the main salesperson who helped me through the car buying process. We test drove the car I was interested in, a Legacy, but he made it clear that if I wanted to test drive every car on the lot that would not be an issue. 

We test drove another model similar to the crossover I used to have, but I decided on the Legacy sedan. Dallas was the one that suggested we try the other model, and I have to say that was a good call that I would not have made without him. It helped me make the decision much easier.

Once I decided on the vehicle I wanted we talked finances. Dallas made it clear that he was willing to work with me in any way he could to make the deal fit my needs. We talked it over for a long while but in the end came to a good place, Dallas always listening to my concerns, and shaping things to fit.

Once we had a rough outline I went back to sign all the paperwork with the finance person Ryan, who helped to make the deal fit within my situation. 

I also got the chance to talk to several of the managers as we were walking around the dealership. They all asked if there was any way they could help, or if they could order me a car from another dealership if they did not have what I wanted in stock.

I cannot imagine the car buying experience being any better than the one I had at Subaru Clear Lake. And of course I am happy with the car.",5.0

The look and feel of the crosstrek totally won me over, and the experience at the dealership was exceptional. I worked with Tin and Ryan to figure out what I wanted and make sure I could afford it. They were not pushy and gave me no resistance when I wanted to leave to compare their car to others I was considering at other dealerships. They were informed, helpful, and nice- making an experience I was dreading as painless as possible. 10/10 would buy  car from them again.",5.0

1016,"March 16, 2015","Without a doubt, I had the best car buying experience I have ever experienced with Clear Lake Subaru. Mr. Jose (Joe) Gomez was my sales person, and through the entire process he was very professional. I was deeply impressed by the level of high quality work he put in to get me the best deal possible. Mr. Gomez knew the Subaru product/brand inside and out, and that to me indicates that he truely wants his customers to be as excited about the brand/car as he is! He was very respectful and attentive to my needs, and didn't pull pressure sales tactics on my unlike the competition around Houston. The other sales staff and the management team I met were very friendly and created an overall positive experience for me. Unfortunately, I didn't follow through as it makes sense for me to wait until I reduce my current car's negative equity. But when I am in better shape on that negative equity, I will surely be paying Clear Lake Subaru a visit as they have won my business in the future, hands down. I wish other dealerships learned the true meaning of customer service, like that exemplified by Clear Lake Subaru. Thank you Joe and your team, I look forward to working with you all in the near future!",5.0

1019,"March 14, 2015","I recently purchased a Subaru Forester from Lithia Subaru of Clear Lake. I had been toying with the idea of purchasing a Forester since mid April of last year and when I visited another dealership in August of 2015, I was extremely turned off by their pushy sales and sandbagging techniques to make me purchase a vehicle in a color that I did not want on a day that I was just looking for a vehicle. They even got me to buy crossbars to have installed at an additional cost.  I returned the car immediately. With the thought that I did not want a Subaru after all.

I looked at those crossbars for months sitting in my utility room  and continued to do market research on the quality of the Subaru Forester. A friend convinced me to give Lithia Subaru of Clear Lake a chance so in February, I walked in and inquired about the Forester. 

 I was greeted by a non-pushy salesman, Andy Hollister, who when I informed him of my previous experience at the other dealership, respected that I was just there to look and test drive.
I found a Forester that I really liked, in a color that I really liked and with the trim packages that I was unsure of.  We talked about price and I decided to think about it over night.  They respected that and we made an appointment to discuss the SUV the next day.

I test drove several other Foresters the next day and opted for a fully loaded Forester. We closed the sale the same evening.  I felt 100% happy with my choice. I felt very excited about the dealership and the way that I was treated.

Several days later, I had those crossbars installed on my new Forester. The service department installed them and washed my Forester before returning it to me.  SUPERB treatment.

The dealership is new, clean, refreshing. The service department is state of the art and fantastically organized. I really appreciated how the dealership works to recycle materials and use reclaimed water.  I LOVE my new Subaru Forester!!! I strongly recommend Lithia Subaru of Clear Lake to anyone wanting to purchase a Subaru.",5.0

The pricing was matter-of-fact with no hidden costs or fees.  Finance Manager, Ryan Wiseman, worked with my husband and was both professional and up-front about the contract.  We happily drove out with a safe, great looking car which we felt was fairly priced.   I would highly recommend purchasing a Subaru through Clear Lake Subaru.

1032,"February 17, 2015","I walked into Subaru of Clear Lake (henceforth written as SCL) in Houston, TX on Valentine's day with the intention of taking home either a 2015 WRX or 2015 BRZ. As much as I wanted that to happen, I had my doubts because, while my credit score was fair, I had very little credit history (only a couple school loans to be more precise). I guess it would be more appropriate to say that my credit score was untarnished. There wasn't enough activity on it to either bring it down or pull it up any significant amount. That being said, I wasn't so sure if I'd be driving away in anything other than the Volkswagen I pulled up in as I needed a loan to make this happen - and make it happen they did.

The first thing that I noticed when I pulled up to SCL was that I was able to park my car and walk into the dealership without feeling like a scavenged piece of meat. I was pleasantly greeted by the young woman at the front desk who swiftly called Bradley, from sales, over after hearing the reason for my visit. At other dealerships, I absolutely hate it when I'm ""picked off"" before I even step out of the car that I pulled up in. I understand the idea behind it, but it's just a little much in my opinion. 

As stated earlier, I had doubts surrounding my financial situation so I decided to be very open in conversation. I let Bradley know what was going on, and he led me to a financial manager to answer any questions that I had. We only spoke briefly so I do not remember his name, but he was very helpful and answered all of my questions directly. 

After that exchange, my confidence was restored and I returned to Bradley to begin shopping. I was stuck between the practicality and power of the 2015 WRX and the impractical, much slower, but arguably more fun, 2015 BRZ. I ended up test driving both: a Dark Grey Metallic BRZ 6AT Limited and a World Rally Blue WRX 6MT base model. Bradley knows cars and, more importantly, understands the car enthusiast. There wasn't a spiel about practicality, fuel economy, or ""hey, look at this shiny thing that you should base this entire purchase on"" because he knew that none of that mattered to me. I was looking for a car that would provide me with the most enjoyable owner's experience overall (as an enthusiast) and he helped me make that decision. After fighting with myself for a good half-hour, I decided to go with the BRZ.

Now that we knew what I wanted, we knew how much of a loan I'd need after my down payment. I don't remember his name, but the gentleman who negotiated with Chase Bank got me a much lower rate than I was expecting given my situation. I wish I could recall his name because that guy made this whole thing possible. Cheers to you, man.  

Now for the paperwork. Ryan Wiseman out of Tennessee. He made all of the boring paperwork make sense and we got everything done in a timely manner. On top of that, he's a real nice guy to just sit down and talk with. Really took the edge off of signing away that kind of money. 

TL;DR
These guys made it happen. Simple as that. I was a little skeptical as a first time buyer but Subaru of Clear Lake made the experience a very pleasant and hassle-free one. I will be buying all of you guys a metaphorical beer. Cheers.
