0,"March 26, 2020","    Nissan is fortunate to have Frankie Kalista!  His expertise and professional skills were instrumental in helping me to find the right 2019 Nissan Frontier on February 29, 2020. He took the time and had such patience in helping me with my questions and concerns.  His knowledge in his profession was amazing!  I  highly recommend him in every capacity to help people choose the vehicle they want. My friends and family have been contacted about his unique ability to represent Nissan.  I would gladly do business with him again.  Thank you, Frankie Kalista, for being who you are and for your quality service.",5.0

2,"June 04, 2018","I dropped off my car last Tuesday at lunch. I called back trying to get him the information for my extended warranty, and was asked my name by every person that answered the phone, but never could get to my service advisor. Every time I'm transferred to him, a generic voicemail box picks up instantly, with no rings. My last update was last Wednesday afternoon from the technician working on my car, asking a question about the vehicle symptoms. I offered at that time to come drive the car for him to replicate the issue. I've called twice today, with the same screening by the ladies that answer the phone, give them my name, they tell me there are no updates on my car, they transfer me, computerized voicemail instantly picks up, but I can't reach my service advisor. I'm tempted to pick the car up and take it elsewhere. He was very pleasant and nice when I dropped off, but the call screening process seems to be a bit much, and they appear to work from voicemail and call at their convenience, not mine.",1.0
3,"March 31, 2018","Took vehicle in to have cruise control fixed. Instead came back with over $2000.00 in repair needs. Denied the work at that point. Took vehicle to independent mechanic who disagreed with their estimate. None of it was necessary, Came back to have a pair of rubber bumpers replaced on the cruise control to fix the issue. Instead the started dismantling the engine and did multiple damages in the process include cracking the radiator. Then could not figure out how the fix a leak in the circulation system. All work done was never approved to be done.Be careful of what they do and question any work they want to do on your vehicle. If you can, get a second opinion.",1.0

I really like the fact that Brent answered all of our questions and gave us the time to compare between different vehicles without rushing or pressure us just to make a sale like other salesman do. Thank you Ronnie Collins for taking the time to explain in detail all our questions, and finally thanks to Terry Drummond for making all the paperwork signing a very fun and quick experience. I would definitely recommend this dealership and staff to my friends in the future.",5.0

17,"June 25, 2014",Mike was an excellent help in our search for our vehicle. He was very helpful without being pushy at all. I myself have been in sales for over ten years and was very appreciative of how he took care of me and my family. I have been to other dealerships in the past where I felt they were trying to be secretive and pull one over on us. Everybody we met was very nice and helpful. Will definitely recommend this dealership to friends and family. ,4.4

27,"May 20, 2014","I have driven Lincoln's for the past 10+ years, and I was ready to trade for a new car. I was considering another Lincoln, but wanted to test drive a Murano before making a decision. When I arrived at the dealership, the sales rep, Will Franklin, showed me a Murano. Close by was a Pathfinder, which he also showed me. I fell in love with the Pathfinder. Will showed me everything about the car and was very attentive and kind, even offering me a bottle of water. I traded a truck in and was given a fair price for it and I even got to take the new car home that same day. Will Franklin showed me all about the Navigation system and surround camera, and all of the other features. He is really very knowledgeable about the cars and seems to enjoy showing and selling cars. He made the process of buying a new car even more fun. I love the Pathfinder and am so pleased with it. Buying a new car is a big decision and he made it a pleasant and exciting one. I will definitely refer friends and family to Nissan and to Will Franklin.",5.0
28,"May 19, 2014","When you find a Sales Person like Ray Marquez, you keep coming back.  When my wife buys a car, he deals with her, respecting the buyer, not the husband.  He sells what YOU want!  He doesn't steer you to his deals.  He has now sold vehicles to both my daughter's-in-law, two to my wife, one to me and one to our Catholic Priest.  I recommend anyone and everyone to buy from Garlyn Shelton because of their staff and the way they conduct business.  Over the years, I have gotten to know them well and I respect them all for how they run the dealership.  Lambert Havelka, McGregor, TX",5.0
29,"May 18, 2014","I have purchased many vehicles from this dealership.  I have always been treated with respect, kindness, and helpfulness.  I've always felt that everyone there worked to get me into the right vehicle for the right price.

Robby Shadburn has continued to go above and beyond to take care of my business.  He is the reason I keep referring friends and family.  He is the BEST OF THE BEST!

32,"May 02, 2013","Was really disappointed with visit to a competitor a few days earlier. Was not even going to keep looking. Someone suggested giving Garlyn Shelton Nissan a try. Best car buying experience ever...and I've bought quite a few new cars since I LOVE driving new! The salesman was so patient and the General Sales Manager, Ronnie Collins, was not aloof like the previous one at the competitor. He came out on the sales floor to help with the whole process and I ended up with the vehicle he recommended. Still driving and loving the Xterra Pro 4X4. I ended up happy with the trade in value for my Miata MX5 and a van I was trading in. Happy with the sales price of the Xterra. Happy with the way i was treated as a valued customer. The GM Ronnie Collins made the whole experience a success. DEFINITELY sold me on Garlyn Shelton. Won't buy any where else and tell everyone that is where to go.",5.0
