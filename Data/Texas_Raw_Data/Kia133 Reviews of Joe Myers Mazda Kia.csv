5,"June 10, 2020",Not my best experience- told me an hour and 7+ hours my car was ready. They don’t give realistic wait times so can be frustrating when it’s this badly off. Typically it’s 2+ hours if they say an hour but this was ridiculous. Just set realistic expectations and stay on it to update.,2.0

Justin in sales will confuse the terms of negotiation and back out of numbers previously agreed by including down payment into O/D pricing in the middle of a negotiation.  Understandable, if negotiations start this way, but you cant pull back from numbers by factoring new variables (down payment) to make the negotiation numbers look better.  Really sneaky and a waste of time.  I do not recommend.",1.4

46,"October 16, 2019","This has to be one of the most antiquated dealerships I have been to lately.  I went in on 10/12/2020 and had an appointment with Hung Pham.  After searching and finding a parking spot I arrived and was directed to his office area and that he would be in shortly.  I was not offered any insight as to how long Hung was going to be.  After waiting 20 minutes I decided that perhaps this was not the level of customer service I was seeking and I left.  I received a call on Monday from Hung asking, since I did not make it in on Saturday would like to reschedule.  I proceeded to tell him I had in fact been there on Saturday during my appointment time and that I did not care how good his vehicles were because his customer service was severely lacking.

The good news is on this trip we found Superior Subaru and my new Outback just a couple blocks away.  Superior Subaru does have a clean organized dealership and outstanding customer service.   

Bottom line, if you want a dirty, antiquated dealership with chaotic parking with poor customer service this is your place.",1.0
47,"October 13, 2019","I rated this dealership as a 10 because they really tried to do everything they could to get me in the car I wanted. They lowered my Apr and made a great deal with me on the overall price. This was my first time buying a car and I'm a young girl so I was terrified they would try to take advantage of my lack of mechanical knowledge, bargaining skills and inexperience with these things! Tyler (my salesman) and Nick (sales manager) answered every single question I had with more detail than I needed but it was appreciated! Seriously, go see Tyler for a car. He won't screw you over and will literally help you call different insurance companies to make sure you get a good deal on insurance too!",5.0

64,"August 31, 2019",We were able to purchase a new 2018 Mazda CX-5 grand touring from Joe Myers and the purchasing process was absolutely painless. They gave us a phenomenal deal on the Mazda and were very fair with our trade-in. We will hands down be back to purchase with y’all again. Joe Myers Mazda beats out all Mazda dealerships in Houston. I did my homework and gave every dealership in Houston an opportunity to earn our business and Joe Myers beat everyone out by a far. This dealership understands customer service and it shows. ,5.0

From Carlos to the financial department (i’m so sorry for forgetting his name), there’s no other dealership i’d rather have gone to.  ",5.0

72,"March 25, 2019","Left my Mazda 3 for service and even though brakes were found below minimum they did not call me, just gave back a car they consider undrivable. I then approved the budget for the repair just to get a call next day with a 75% increase, which I reluctantly approved,  and another 60% on top as surprise gift when I picked up the car. They definitively dont know what they are doing. Totally incompetent",1.2
73,"March 22, 2019","I was moving to Texas and needed a car by a certain time. Having never walked into the dealership and also being out of state, the entire process was done over e-mail and about 3 phone calls. This must have been the shortest and as smooth as possible buying experience from a dealership (besides Tesla). No time was wasted on both sides and after few e-mails back and forth, the deal was done. Joe and Omar made the whole transaction easy for being an out of state buyer AND super transparent with price and other costs. I had them list out every single ""additional"" costs (licensing, registration, any special local or Texas related costs, doc fees, etc.) so I know what I'm paying for. After a holding deposit, I was able to pick up the car when I arrived there and within 2 hours (mostly due to thorough car walk around and test drive), I was out. Within few days, Omar sent me a personalized thank you note as well. 

Another major delighter is, after one week, I couldn't figure out how to change camera view settings when the car is in reverse (2019 Mazda CX-5). I e-mailed Omar asking for help and within few hours, he sent me a video recording of how to change the camera setting. Instead of just writing back in words, he responded in the most intuitive, easiest way for anyone to understand. Being a previous BMW owner, even BMW doesn't do this. Actually, most dealerships are done with you once you drive off. Joe Myers Mazda definitely goes one step (maybe many more steps) ahead of other dealerships. I know I can count on Joe and Omar in the future for any help with the car and I'll definitely be referring this dealership. 

Thank you Joe and Omar for accommodating my travel schedules and for dealing with my ""down to every decimal point detail"" in purchasing this car. ",5.0
74,"January 01, 2019","On Car Guru they have a used Nissan Frontier SV.  The SV model is with power windows - and the description states power windows  BUT the photos show a S not an SV and obvious manual window handles.  I had requested info online for another vehicle and never a response.  This stating they have one vehicle but showing another doesn't set well.  Don't say it's an ""accident"" because someone is responsible for posting.  Not impressed.
Cannot give but minimal rating for a dealership and their management overlooking an obvious discrepancy like this.",1.0

It seemed like I should have been near the first in line at the 7:30 AM opening and wondered why it took so long since oil change places do it in 30 minutes...I know a rotation and inspection take extra time but did feel 2 1/2 hours for service was too long.",5.0

85,"July 31, 2018","Although my trips to the service department have been a little long, they have done a great job fixing my car so far.  I go here for all my scheduled oil changes and tire rotations, and the prices are very good.  Yeah, they try to up-sell service to me every time, but they are not pushy about it when I say no.  This last visit, Brandon upgraded my Mazda Connect software at no charge, and even threw a new battery in my key fob.  He's also going to look into getting the paint chips on my wheels fixed.  I stayed an hour past closing while they finished up the car, but everyone was very courteous and I appreciated the thoroughness to make sure everything was completed.  4 stars for the great people, -1 star for things taking a little more time than it should.

87,"December 20, 2017",I just bought a new Mazda CX5 from Joe Meyers Mazda this past week and this is by far the best car buying experience I've ever had.

I was never pressured and they were honest and upfront about everything.   They made buying this car a very fun and pleasant experience. Also they have the best prices around. Even the dealer where I bought my previous mazda said he couldn't match their price. I will defiantly be back. ,5.0

I was called and told the hose was fine but had how long had it been since the spark plugs were replaced and the fuel injectors cleaned. Well I thought because they were working on my car that they thought the work needed to be done. It had been several years since the plugs had been replace and the injectors cleaned so I had them do the work. That was the biggest mistake I ever made. Cleaning the injectors broke down the catalytic converter and destroyed my tribute. Instead of saying the made a mistake with my car the told me to take it to Midas they didn't have the parts to fix my car. I would never recommended taking a car here

92,"September 21, 2016","To everyone who is thinking about buying a mazda I would definitely recommend Joe Myers Mazda. They bend over backward for you to make sure you are satisfied with the car your buying and that you get the best service you could ask for. They are completely friendly and up front about the entire car buying process and making you feel like one of there family. They even take you back out to the car to have look it over one more time before you buy it make sure you are totally satisfied. They never pressure you into a car or try and persuade you a way from a car. They will however make sure they tell you everything about the car you are looking at and answer all of you questions about the car. If they don't  have the answer they wil find it out for you. I personally dealt with Brain who has been just great making sure I liked the car and that everything is going great with the car. Like I said before they want you to be 100% happy with the car you get from them. By the way the prices there are better then the other dealerships around.

94,"July 24, 2016","I recently had my car in for a leaky oil pan, needless to say it's still leaking. After writing a review about my opinion with the service manager Troy my repair was refused by Troy unless I removed the review. As a consumer I feel I have the right to voice my opinion. I left several messages for the general manager and after a month of waiting never got a call back. The funny thing is that I scheduled an appointment and my wife showed up to the dealership, the first thing that came out of Troy's mouth was ""telling your husband to remove the review he left or we aren't touching your car"". After the bad first experience we had he should have apologized and tried to better the situation but he didn't. He called me and said that if I removed the review he would fix my car but until that happened he wouldn't touch it.

99,"April 17, 2015","In January 2015 I leased a 2015 Kia Optima EX. The process to get the car was fairly painless, Hung was very kind but then the problems started. I was contacted to say that the wrong VIN number had been put on all of my paperwork and that I would need to change the VIN number with my insurance as the car was not covered. Before I had a chance to go to the dealership to resign I got a flat tire. I signed up and am extra paying for a Mechanical Protection Plan  (MPP) which is supposed to cover all aspects of the car, tires, towing etc. I called the number to request a tow and was told that I could not be picked up as I was on the freeway. When signing up for the MPP I specifically asked if I could take the care ANYWHERE for service and was told yes. I got the flat late Saturday night and PAID OUT OF POCKET to have the car towed to Walmart as its close to my home. When I called to use my MPP I was told that the tire would need to be changed at a dealership and it would have to wait until Monday as the dealerships were not open on Sunday. I PAID OUT OF POCKET for the tire. I brought this matter up to the dealership and was told that I would be reimbursed for my expenses (I never was) and that if I was unhappy with the plan to cancel it. I went to the dealership to resign the papers with the correct VIN number and spoke to a man with a British accent who was probably the rudest customer service person I have ever met. By the time I was done talking to him I honestly wanted to leave the car at the location and never deal with KIA again. He also told me that if I wanted to get a new MPP card that I could call them and arrange it, thought that would be part of his job, guess I was wrong. I was reassured that everything would be fixed and taken care of. I called up to Joe Myers to see if my plates were in as I still have paper plates on my car, I was told they were in and my boyfriend drove an hour and a half to find out that the plates were associated with the incorrect VIN number. I still do not have a new MPP card which I pay extra for monthly and still have paper plates. This whole situation is very disheartening. I love the car but can not stand this dealership. I am now going to Gay Family and notice a huge difference in competence and customer service.",1.8
100,"October 19, 2014","My first visit I was looking for 2014 Mazda3 sedan in gray. I couldn't agree on a price with their games of checking back and forth with manager. Two days later I came back looking for 2015 Mazda3. Manny Villareal told me they have a red one in stock although checking their website the inventory did not show a 2015 red Mazda. I thought they must have new stock that did not show in their website's inventory yet. Manny even talked to my son on the phone specifying that I was negotiating for either 2014 gray or 2015 red. My son said he preferred 2015 red Mazda3. 

I negotiated the price with Manny and his manager for a red 2015. They told me to pay $500 deposit because I had other plans that evening. I gave them my AMEX. Manny drove the car to the front. He had removed the MSRP sticker from the window. It was not even in the glove compartment. Sensing something not right while they were processing the transaction, I stood outside the door of their office and asked Manny one more time if he was selling me a 2015 car. He turned to the manager in their office and they were whispering. I went to the table about 10 steps away and waited. Manny came back to tell me it was a 2014 car. 

If I hadn't asked again they would have gone ahead to process the paperwork. I probably would  have caught it at the final signing. When I found out they had misled me into paying a deposit for a different model I was very upset. Manny told me that there was no difference b/t 2014 and 2015 model. Granted there is no difference in design, I was buying 2015, which is now starting to trickle in for inventory. There is more room for negotiation with 2014 models. Thus I did not make an offer as low as if I was negotiating for a 2014 model.

I told Manny that he lied to me and wasted my time. I grabbed my AMEX card and left. I did not sign the deposit receipt. That was Friday afternoon. I just checked my AMEX online today, Sunday. Joe Meyers had processed the $500. These people are dishonest and have no shame. I found a 2015 car at another dealer. I am disputing the charge with AMEX.

101,"September 16, 2014","We were interested in a  2009 Ford Flex they had for sale. We called the dealership Friday evening and spoke with Hunter. We talked for like 20 minutes. Very, very, good salesman at the dealership. I live in Galveston County over an hour away. More in traffic. I had to be certain that they would meet my needs before I drove all that way.
Hunter talked to his boss and said this deal was doable.  My family and I arrive there and meet Hunter. Everything went great even with my trade being a little upside down we worked out a deal that was fair. The finance office tries to get you to buy all this other stuff you don't need but that's their job. We bought an extended warranty and that's it. Well they gave us 15 gallons of gas to get home on. This filled the tank half way. I was like Holy Cow how big is this gas tank. We left and drove to the grocery store near our home. I decided to fill the tank up. I pumped 6 gallons of gas and it stopped. I asked my wife if it was full. She said no only half. So I knew something was wrong with the gas gauge. I called Hunter and told him the problem. This was around 8:50PM. He said no worries bring it in Monday to be fixed. This vehicle came with a 3000 mile 3 month warranty from the dealership. Very Cool. Well Monday came and I drove all the way there very early to avoid traffic. They gave me a rental car to use so I could make it back to work for half a day. They even fixed the radios antenna for me. The car runs fine now and we are very happy. The only thing I would say is they need a little help in their detail department.

111,"October 05, 2013","Is there anybody bought a Kia Sportage LX 2013 worth more than $30,000 like I'd ever done from Joe Myers Mazda/Kia? Yes, I was stupidly bought that car from that dealer. They was cheated me in brazen and now that forced me have to work more harder to pay bills for 6 years.

As I was a new experience buyer stepped in and made a deal with them for the Kia Sportage LX 2013 at the price out of $24,000 (Actually the value of that car didn't worth that much, Right?). That's OK I accepted to buy it at $24,000. And then you know what? In the financing process they put the big trap on me by pulling up the car value up to $30,000. The loan officer over there 
(I got that guy's name here but I know that they will remove it if I try to post it up), he seemed try forcing to me buy the optional instead of I refused to buy any of those optional programs (Skylink, Gap, etc.); finally, those stuffs still appeared in the contract as him expected.

Oh my God, I put $5,000  down payment + $ 24,700 bank financed  + the interest fee $100+ per month for 72 months (My credit score at that time was 732). So total value of my car would be more than $35,000 if I pay $400 a month. What a gouging price!

For 4 days they had my husband go up there on his lunch break to ""sign"" the contract. Everytime he went up there they never had anything ready. The last day we went up there to sign the contract they tell us at 7:40 pm that we couldnt sign the contract because myhusbands license had just expired. They knew from day 1 that his license was expired and NEVER say anything. The whole day my husband was  talking to them about getting insurance on the car, he even asked if his name needed to be on it and they told him NO. So when we went that night to sign the contract they decide to tell us that he needs to beon the insurance. We left the deal alone to go take care of my husbands license and then came back to them a onth lateer to see if the pilot was still there and we could finish the deal. Chris told me that we could and he would call me back that same day. He proceeded to keep telling me everything is good so we should have no problems. Now remember they told us the deal went through last month and it was GUARANTEED that we were getting the car. Three days after I spoke to Chris and him avoiding my calls, I spoke to Kevin whi then tells me the deals was NEVER going to go through from the start. They lied for the whole month. WAisted our time for NOTHING. My husband just called today to complain to the manager and Chris then proceeded to give my husband the number to Kevin instead of the person above them.
