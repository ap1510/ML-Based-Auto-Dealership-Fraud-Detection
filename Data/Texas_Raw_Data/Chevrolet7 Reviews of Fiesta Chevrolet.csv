1,"October 03, 2017","This was a special visit....me & the manager walked out to my car to get my insurance papers , and I heard a faint meow & sure enough there was a kitten stuck in the radiator of the car next to me... Everyone did an excellent job of rescuing that kitten for me..they ended up having to disassemble the whole front end of that car..they all need an award for the' guys with a heart' ...These are the kinda things Noone hears about...Unfortunately.. .. Well, I will never forget it & I appreciate & applaud the staff & service department, & of course the manager that made it all happen. Thank you, By the way his name is Fiesta (kitten) & he's doing great..I'll bring him in for a visit soon..thanks again, Bobbi",5.0

6,"July 25, 2011","Horrible experience.  Responded to ad for 08 mustang and manager would not go down one cent. I leave and call an hour later and was told the car was still available by salesman, that he would wait for me. Ten minutes later he called that the car was no longer for sale.(in other words they did not want to Honor AD) This is a perfect example of a dealership that lies on their ads. I will never return or recommend this place to anyone. 

BUYER BEWARE!!!!!!!!
