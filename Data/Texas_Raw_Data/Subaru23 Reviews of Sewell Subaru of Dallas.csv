0,"May 29, 2020","I will start by saying that I. historically, have never left a new car buying experience without being angry, disappointed and feeling a little bit disgusted...that was, until last Monday. After an auto accident, we were in need of a new vehicle. We had narrowed it down to specifically the Subaru Forester Touring. We had been to the lot and chose a color on Sunday and had already procured financing. We came prepared for battle! From the moment we walked in and were greeted by our salesperson, Summer Lopez, our battle armor became less important. Summer is young and to be honest, we didn't anticipate the extensive knowledge she possessed about the Forester we were looking at as well as the entire Subaru line. She BLEW US AWAY! She answered every question we had, told us about every feature and allayed our fears of a bad car deal. I personally thought that was impossible. She took our information, gave us a fair price, took our financing information. Then she sent the car to get ready for us to take home. In the meantime, she came back to us to let us know that if we were interested, they actually could get us a better interest rate than we came in with. WOW! Yes, we will take that! She never once tried to upsell us, change our minds, play Jedi mind games or make us feel less than her most important customers. Even after we signed everything, she went through all of the books, went to the car and helped us set up all of the technical stuff and our phone links. I have never left a dealership with a smile on my face and feeling like I had just experienced a WIN! But now that I have, I won't ever go anywhere else! Summer just won Sewell another customer for life. I am still in awe that a car deal can actually make you fell good...even a week later! Thank you, thank you, thank you, Summer Lopez, for not restoring, but building, my faith in a car dealership!",5.0
1,"May 24, 2020","I bought my first Subaru with Sewell last weekend and couldn't be happier! I worked with Will Hunt for about about 6-7 months before I decided on a new Forester. He wasn't pushy and would patiently check in with me until I was ready to make my decision. 

I would definitely recommend this place to friends and family",5.0
2,"March 03, 2020",Great experience starts with Top notch sales associate.....William Hunt is the best he was recommended by my brother who had just purchased a Subaru. I told William my needs and he took the time to explain every option available. I decided on a Outback... William walked me Through the financing which was surprisingly easy.. Thank you so much... I’ve joined the Sewell family.,5.0
3,"November 15, 2019","This was my first experience with Sewell and Subaru. Everything about the dealership ""oozed"" professionalism. As an independent older woman, I was never talked down to or treated differently.  In my experience with buying or repairing cars, that is huge. We notice. William Hunt was my sales associate and, in my opinion, is a wonderful example of the Sewell ethic.  Professional, but personable; knowledgeable, handling my questions with ease. Will's comfortable manner simply took the stress out of car buying. But then everyone that I came into contact with at Sewell Subaru had that same energy. A wonderful experience.  
P.S. LOVE my Forester!",5.0
4,"September 04, 2019","Our BMW X5 was just out of warranty and would in need some costly repairs. On the fly, my wife and I?  went to Sewell Subaru since we love the dealership. Unfortunately, where we are with our finances we needed our X5 paid off and a lower payment on the Subaru. We were headed towards leasing and this situation helped us. Will worked with our monthly figure and was super duper patient, helpful, fill up our gas and washed our car twice. He was super transparent and helpful in getting us comfortable. He was great to my daughters too. Special recognition for Michael the finance manager to getting my deal done. We leased a 2020 Ascent Touring and we love the SUV with so much more space for the 3rd row. I? would recommend picking this dealership and paying a little more one time and get this great dealership who prides themselves on first class service!! I've recommended Will/Sewell to 2 friends that are in the market for a new Subaru. ",5.0
5,"August 15, 2019","We purchase a car infrequently, about every 14 years or so. We drive Subarus. D Oguntona at Sewell Subaru worked hard and smart to find a Subaru matched to our budget, features and color. He worked at our schedule without pushing. The selection and purchase process were great. Thanks D and Sewell Subaru. ",5.0
6,"July 29, 2019","Love my new, Assent! Easiest car buying experience, ever. Was treated with respect and was not pressured. Jim Kirby was my salesman, he went over the enitire car with me! Michael in finance was great, too! Sewell customer for life! ",5.0
7,"July 22, 2019","We've determined that Mr. Sewell's value proposition does not align with our needs and today's pricing transparency for auto purchases.  We had done our homework and due diligence in advance to determine that our 2019 Subaru Forester should cost $34k and our 2017 Lexus NXT was worth $27k, so we should have been at $7k net.   The Sales Manager started at $13,200 (almost full MSRP for the Subaru and saying our car was worth $23.5k, which is just absurd) and then came back at $10,300.  We had thought since our Lexus had 21k miles and was in very good condition that it could be certified, hence our visit to Sewell since it represents both brands.  The Sales Manager stated that our tires had only 4 mil of tread.  I used my tread depth tool and measured 6 mil, which corroborated what I was told during our recent service at another Lexus dealer.  We also test drove a loaner with 5k miles and our preferred color combo only to be subsequently advised it could not be sold to us.  We quickly excused ourselves, had lunch, drove 15 miles to a Subaru competitor and had a deal almost exactly at our number within 30 minutes.  

We even received a Sewell notecard from our salesperson (not the Sales Manager) expressing sincere apologies and regret for how we were treated.  Certainly a very stark and different experience from what is happily portrayed in Sewell's television commercials.  

We prefer to purchase a vehicle with transparent pricing instead of the old way my Dad had to endure, negotiating $500 at a time. I will never visit a Sewell dealership again.",1.0
8,"December 02, 2018","Have trouble with RAB?  The service department is trained to lie about this topic. They can't keep it from randomly stopping the car and snapping your neck, they can't fix it because Subaru won't correct the problem, Subaru  will  not recall their cars no matter what. With 13,000 miles I would gladly dump the car but because I am a little more honest than they are I can't in good conscience pass it off as being worth the money I should get for it.  Stay away from Sewell, just the usual car dealer bull. ",1.0

My issue started when I brought my car in for a check engine light and a couple other warranty issues. I pick up the car and there is a huge door ding on the driver door. My wife points it out to the service rep, we go in and watch the video and they determine it was their fault and would fix it. A few days pass, I go to pick up my car, when I pick up my car it is dirty. NEVER have I ever seen sewell give a customer a dirty car, the service rep said it rained earlier that morning and that was the reason. Earlier meaning around 6am and this was around 1pm I'm picking the car up. Ok, no big deal I take the car. I drive the car to my wife, she notices there's grease all over headliner and on driver door panel. Then she notices damage on rear bumper cover. She is livid, and I'm irritated. So I call and ask to speak with the service manager Brian Walker. He asked me to bring the car. I get there, he looks over the car and we go into his office. We sit in his office for over 20 minutes going over camera footage and he determines the damage was done by you guys as the damage wasn't there when I dropped the car off. He says he can't paint the bumper and make it match because it's plastic and wouldn't match. He offers a 300 check, and a full detail and buff. He points out a scuff that would be addressed when they buff the car. 

I get the car back, the scuff is still there, and I think maybe the scuff wouldn't come out while being buffed. I get it home, take some wax and it comes right off. Meaning Brian lied to me about the buff job. Considering all the other stuff that's happened its no shock and the least of my worries",1.2
10,"June 24, 2018","You cannot go wrong at Sewell Subaru.  For me, Sewell Subaru was a hidden secret.  I had a misconception of Subaru's as tiny cars.  But, just like other makes, Subaru's come in all sizes, and the technology is as great or better than other makes.  The value is indisputable.  And Sewell Subaru, as a dealership in Dallas, provides its buyers all of the extra's that are usually only at luxury brand dealerships, such as free loaners when cars are serviced & free car washes.  Salesman, Pat Bentel, is a terrific representative of Sewell Subaru.  I especially appreciated his allowing me to test drive the Subaru on the toll road, as well as test-experience the amazing rear emergency braking with a yellow cone.  ",5.0
11,"May 01, 2018","My wife and I had an incredible experience with Clay Johnson at Sewell Subaru of Dallas. This dealership really does value every client or potential client and try extremely hard. We'd never bought a Subaru before and had a really crappy Jeep before (seriously just a piece of s**t) that constantly broke down. We had a beating getting that car serviced from different dealerships that treated us poorly, etc. 

Anyways, so we came to Sewell of Subaru to exchange our jeep for a used CPO 2017 Subaru Outback 3.6r touring, all white, bad mother. We initially looked at the foresters and liked them but fell in love with the more powerful 3.6r outback model. Never did we feel sold or pressured by Clay or anyone at the dealership. They were upfront about anything that might have happened to the car. No surprises and I trust if I had found something later, they would do the right thing. 

We became a Subaru family because of this dealership and they've earned buckets of my money for years to come... hopefully all going to Clay. Cheers and good luck Sewell Subaru!!

p.s. free car washes - free loaner car during service - roadside assistance within certain mile radius. they rock!",5.0
12,"July 27, 2017","Got a letter from Subaru stating that the Takata airbags were recalled. I have been through this before with my Honda, so no big deal. Called to make an appointment to drop off the car. When I got to the dealership early this next morning, they said “um... we don't have the airbag in stock.” Something as big as a Takata airbag recall should be handled better! The scheduler should at least know the stock situation. Had to drive back home and wait for the airbag to come in a week later. Rescheduled again and made sure they actually had my airbag before making the drive into town to drop the car off. They had previously agreed to provide a loaner car, and imagine my surprise when they tried to stick me with a compact car from some other maker. I had to ask them to provide an equivalent model to my Outback. I returned a couple days later, picked up my car and noticed when I got home that some dash parts had been broken in the airbag replacement. I also had a driver's door window switch that suddenly stopped working and a windshield washer motor that didn't have as much pressure. Odd, huh? When I quizzed the CSR about the coincidence of this and the dash parts being broken he responded very defensively and seemed incredulous that I would make such an association. I did not take the car back to get these items addressed as it is not really worth the fight. I can't say for certain the door switch or the washer was their fault, and the dash parts aren't that noticeable in the grand scheme of things. Maybe just a weird coincidence, but I still didn't appreciate how the guy responded. As a very busy person as most of us are, I prefer to move on and deal with a better dealership next time.  ",1.2
13,"September 12, 2016","Sewell Subaru of Dallas has earned my loyalty.  They have a beautiful facility on Lemon Ave. near Love Field, a large inventory, knowledgeable sales team of mostly long-term Sewell employees who don't employ high pressure tactics, and a top shelf service department.  I have been satisfied with every engagement, and when it's time to buy another Subaru they will absolutely get our business.",5.0
14,"June 19, 2016",We just purchased our 4th vehicle from the Sewell family. Trevor McDonal at Seeell Subaru was by far one of the best Sales representatives to work with. He is courteous and goes above and beyond to make sure our needs were met. It was a great buying experience. I love my new Legacy.  Heather M,5.0
15,"November 03, 2015","I made an appointment a week prior for vehicle maintenance and at the time the appointment was made stressed the need for a loaner vehicle. Told no problem.  However, this morning I show up on time and was told they did not have a loaner for me.  So I left.  A simple phone call would have made a difference in my experience.  ",2.0
16,"May 05, 2015","I was having an electrical issue with my new Legacy. I first took the vehicle to Hiley Subaru of Fort Worth. The service department there was very rude and told me the problem was normal. After researching forums by asking other Legacy owners if this was a normal operation, they all told me ""no"" and that I should try a different dealership. After arriving at Sewell, the service department was quick to address my concerns and began diagnosing the problem. It turns out there is a TSB for a faulty part related to my problem! I was relieved to hear that I would not have to live with a problem that another dealership failed to address and take seriously. I highly recommend the skilled professionals at Sewell Subaru! I will never go anywhere else. ",5.0
17,"October 01, 2014",Went to the dealership and told the salesman what vehicle I was interested in he gave me a price but not once was he trying to get a sell. Not once did the GM come talk to me about working a deal out. I felt like I was treated like this because it was the first day of the month. I guess a customer is just a number and I might have gotten treated better if it was the end of month to meet there quota,1.5
18,"August 25, 2014","I recently purchased a pre-owned VW Golf TDI from Sewell Subaru and can't believe what a stress-free, pleasant experience it was.  Paul Kim was calling my phone the instant I sent in an inquiry email from an alert I'd received.  He was courteous and friendly, both on the phone and in person.  The car was priced very fairly and they worked with me to get it within my budget and finalized a deal that was beyond my expectations.  Great coordination between Sales and Financing.  The dealership staff were all friendly and the premises were spotlessly clean and welcoming.  The follow-up customer service, from both Paul Kim and another staff member, convinced me that Sewell really does want customers for life.  Well, I am now a Sewell customer for life and will recommend their dealerships to anyone looking for an exceptional buying experience!",4.6

21,"January 17, 2014","I read the other review posted and I'm not sure we were even in the same dealership.  I went to Sewell Subaru in November 2013 to trade cars.  When I arrived I was promptly greeted by Randy and after discussing what I was looking for, he took me for a test drive then showed me all the vehicles in stock that met my request.  Randy was very easy to deal with and asked questions about what I was expecting for my trade, etc.  He explained the process very well.  Working with the finance person (I believe it was Jon) was also easy.  All in all, the entire experience is one of the best I have ever had when buying a new car.  This is a fantastic dealership that makes you feel at home and bends over backward to get you what you want.  I'm really thinking maybe the other reviewer had credit issues or something, or was thinking that being a jerk was going to get him a better deal.  Doesn't work that way in the real world, being nice and respectful of people always gets you the better deal in the end.  I will recommend Sewell Subaru and specifically Randy to anyone looking for a new car.",4.8
22,"October 17, 2013","I visited Sewell Subaru of Dallas after my girlfriend had visited and set an appointment to look at the deal after we allowed them to run our credit prior that week for our Saturday appointment. When I arrived at the dealership and was waiting for Randy the receptionist was polite in showing where the coffee and restrooms were, but in my experience the person in that position shouldn't make you feel like you are interrupting them and greet you before you can get to standing in front of their desk. As I was getting my coffee after Randy had checked to see if the car was washed and ready to look at (it wasn't), I told him it came across as though he was prepping the papers and washing the car to have me sign and leave, when I felt the price of the payments were still a little high and his response was along the lines of ""well, I don't know why you bothered to come then."" We went to his desk and from that point forward it seemed as though we were just waiting to talk to Jon in finance and were shooting the breeze until then. Randy answered the questions he could, and was better to work with the more I got to talk to him, but it seemed as though, especially in retrospect to the whole experience, I was being passed to Jon as a way to get me out of their dealership because I wanted a better deal than what they had worked. I will break for a second to say I wasn't being unrealistic as another dealership gave me a lot more for my trade, dropped the 2000 down payment Sewell wanted, and provided a similar deduction off MSRP with the same interest rate. When I was waiting to meet with Jon, I had left Randy's office because it felt like I was just keeping him from clients he had waiting on him, I was looking at a Subaru Forester as I had not seen the washed one my girlfriend was interested in yet. Jon called me into his office, he was training a young lady for his position, and shut the door with the two of them and I to talk. Jon proceeded with non-verbal communication (leaning back in the chair, pausing after definitive statements) as well as proceeding to tell me the interest rate, MSRP, trade value, and down payment requirements are all non-negotiable; the whole experience in his office came across patronizing and as though he was showing off for the person he was training (I say patronizing because he went into a whole lecture on how they pay to run the dealership and inventory they have; when someone like me can discuss money factor, holdback, and has already told them my family has industry experience, it should be known I don't need to be talked to about how they are able to make their money). Jon gave me a consistent attitude of no and was pretty rigid, so I left. Randy was not bad to work with and is likely a product of top-down management attitudes, but Jon ruined the entire experience for me with his attitude. I came back to shake Randy's hand and let him know I would give him my decision by end of the day. I purchased a more expensive model of the same car 2 hours later from Huffines Subaru/Kia of Denton instead; they made me feel like they wanted my business. It was kind of how you feel when you complain about service at a large bank vs. your local bank; Sewell Subaru of Dallas felt like a large bank where I am just one number among many and my needs were statistics where my leaving wouldn't hurt them, and Huffines Subaru/Kia of Denton made me feel like a client they valued. I was told no on a couple of requests at Huffine Subaru/Kia of Denton, but was fine with it because it was done with respect, empathy, and I felt they truly listened rather than providing more of the same the same customer service tactics done with opposite thoughts behind them. It is extremely important how someone feels and at Sewell Subaru of Dallas I felt nearly the entire time like a number, like my business wasn't valued, and as though everything was ""take it or leave it."" I regret one thing about my visit and that is driving from Richardson to their dealership and skipping breakfast to make my appointment on time; waste of time. Save yourself some time and just go to Hufines Subaru/Kia of Denton instead. ",2.8
