0,"May 26, 2020",Had a good experience today (for being at a car dealership) My salesman Jonathan Berry did a great job of getting me the best deal he could (we had to do the carsalesman dance) but in the end I drove out in a 2020 F-250. Thanks Jonathan. I would recommend Tomball Ford and Jonathan Berry.,4.8
1,"May 13, 2020","1 STAR!!!!!!

AVOID AT ALL COSTS. They charged me for a spray on bed liner that I did not receive. Also added a hidden fee of $795 (actually more bc this amount was included in the amount I financed) for a GPS locating service I will never use. And the service is only good for 12 months. When I called to ask about it I was told “you signed the agreement.” Which I did; however, it is bad business on their end.

AVOID AT ALL COSTS and if you choose to purchase a vehicle, make sure you review the purchase agreement line item by line item. Because this place loves to make money off of hidden fees!!!!!!! Bad business!",1.0
2,"February 18, 2020","I have bought 3 new Ford vehicles from this dealership in the past and never had a problem until now.
I currently have a 2017 Ford Explorer Limited Edition with 31,500 miles and still under factory warranty, in addition to an extended warranty.  Last week on my way home from Galveston Texas on the Gulf Frwy., my driver side window molding fell off onto the gulf frwy. I stopped and picked it up and drove to the dealership and advised 3 different employees what occurred and they advised me that the molding was not covered under warranty. They also informed me they would replace the molding for $348.50.  They advised me that the molding was replaced by someone other than Ford. I told them this is the way I drove it off their lot, and never had anyone else work on the vehicle except ford dealer ship employees.  I am further contacting Bill Spencer from channel 2 KPRC.  
  Sincerely, James Matuszewski     Talked with Walter Herrera & Gene the Service Manager.",1.0

4,"December 19, 2019","It really is 2019 and yet dealers are still using sales tactics from the 70’s, Tomball Ford so far the worst. From the “Vultures” loitering at the front of the dealership, pouncing on you to pick your sanity dry, to the let me check with my manager back and forth with stupid offers and ridiculous finance/lease deals.

I hope you are reading this Tomball Ford, this is the 21st Century, generally people are more informed, coming to the dealer is the end of the process now. We have the internet, we know what things should cost, we know what is a good Apr, we have Credit Karma and other tools, we know what we can and cannot get. Be straight with people, give the real cost not the MSRP, forget the back and forth let me talk to my manager xxxxxxxx and be straight and up front. We would have genuinely bought a car from you, but your pathetic antiquated tactics forced us to leave with a bitter taste in our mouths. We will buy a car today or tomorrow but not from you.

Perhaps you should visit European dealers, see how they do business and amend your model. Break the mold, be different and better than your competitors, don’t do things the same. I am a professional salesperson for over 25 years, and I have adapted, changed, learnt and overall been profitable. If you want some advice on how to improve look me up! I could give you a good deal for my services, or maybe I should just go see my manager and give you hours of xxxxxxxx.",1.0
5,"May 16, 2019","DO NOT GO THERE!!! READ FIRST! SAFETY IS NOT THEIR CONCERN! 

I’ve had many issues with my car since I started taking it to this location. I have a Ford Escape 2014, I took my car in March 27th because there was a recall on one of the parts, we were told it would take 12 hours and they took (April 2 picked up) 7 days to fix it. We heard all types of excuses including that the technician was sick. Only 1 technician is qualified to work on a small recalled part?? They didn’t want to give us a rental car during the week unless we paid for it since we took it in for a recall, not a warranty issue. My husband and I had a very bad feeling and we even told them that we were worried something happened to the car and they weren’t telling us. 

April 22  we took it in again because the car was driving weird and the remote start wouldn’t work all the time. At the moment we were still under warranty, they called to say everything was fine, we asked them to inspect the car because we know something is wrong and we don’t want to have issues once the warranty had expired. Less than 2 weeks after getting the car back, the car wouldn’t accelerate so we took it straight to Ford (barely made it there). We were 300 miles over our warranty, in person they said they could probably honor the warranty since we had just brought it in and stated how something was wrong...turns out they will not honor the warranty and we have to pay almost $4k for them to fix a problem that I have a feeling they caused. Looking into it, seems to be an issue with the Ford Escapes (they haven’t recalled the transmission/torque converter as they should of by now for huge safety reasons!), there is a big chance the remote start won’t work at times because of this issue. Makes me think they knew that but since my warranty was almost over they didn’t want to deal with it.

I bought that car thinking once my husband and I had a family we wouldn’t have a car note, now I’m 6 months pregnant, without a car, and owing almost $4k on top of the car payments because of lack of safety concern from Ford.

Also, I’ve already had to buy a new battery because of one of the parts that was covered under warranty which caused problems to the battery, so then I had to buy a new battery.

If anyone knows who I can reach out to to help solve this issue, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thank you!",1.8
6,"April 08, 2019","I have dealt with car dealerships and companies many times before. I have also never left a review online before. The service and customer service was so bad that I felt I should take time to tell others to avoid the service department. Would not call me and communicate at all about what was happening with vehicle. Was told by sales advisor it would be done. But without communication by them it was always postponed 2 more days, and 2 more, and 2 more. With no explanation or reasoning why. Had to call/talk to about 10 people, wait 6 days, and go up there myself to actually figure out anything. Many other things I could mention, but overall worst customer service and lying I have ever encountered with ANY business, not just a auto company. I advise to take it to another Ford dealer and avoid this one if you must take it to Ford dealer for recalls. What a shame this expiereince is.",1.0

22,"November 28, 2017","My girlfriend just purchased a Red Ford Mustang GT and when she drove it home, she talked more about how much she enjoyed dealing with Jorge Lopez and how she felt valued as a customer, then she did about her new car, which she loves. When she talked about going to the dealership, I went to dealerrater and read so many great reviews about Mr. Lopez that I informed her to deal with him exclusively, which she did and the outcome was just as I predicted. Keep up the GREAT work Mr. Lopez, if I have any friends or family that need a car, I will send them your way.

23,"November 17, 2017",Jorge Lopez was extremely helpful in the purchase of our new Ford Edge!  He answered all our questions explained the discounts available and the value of our trade in.  After the purchase he heard us talking about removing a personnel licensed plate holder and EZ tag from our trade in.  After signing the paper work and getting ready to drive away we found the EZ tag removed from our trade in and the license plate holder installed!  It was the little attentive things that made this purchase special.,5.0

25,"November 05, 2017","In California where I live, the local Ford dealers are gouging Raptor customers to the tune of $20K over MSRP.  Apparently there are some rich folks around here willing to hand over an extra $20K for a Raptor, but I'm not among them.  After checking with every dealer I could think of in my area (one dealership was offering a ""deal"" at only $15K over MSRP), I expanded my search out of state.

By chance I stumbled on Jorge Lopez's youtube channel, where on one video he said he had plenty of allocation and would guarantee a deal @ MSRP.  I called him and chatted, and set up a deposit for a special order Raptor.  Jorge has been absolutely great, giving timely updates and putting up with a less than patient customer as the order process played out.

The whole experience from order to pickup has been very professional.  If I had to do it again I'd go through Jorge at Tomball Ford without hesitation.",5.0

35,"September 20, 2017","Since we lost two vehicles in the flooding, my wife was soliciting advice among her FaceBook friends for dealers. Somebody suggested Jorge and we went and looked at his FaceBook page and his YouTube videos to try and get a feel for his vibe. Seemed authentic and honest and sure enough, he was. He is smart, friendly, knowledgeable, professional and he really listens! He found the vehicles we wanted with no problems. We then went to Finance with Cary and were pleasantly surprised with his magical numbers skills! Overall, a fantastic, painless experience and we're proud to drive Tomball Fords!

37,"September 09, 2017","
Please read all reviews of this dealership before wasting your time. I have purchased 3 new Fords over the past 10 years and this is by far the worst experience I have ever had. The dealership is run by Kent Hobelman and it appears that he has trained his staff to employ every under handed tactic synonymous with car dealerships. 

If you are expecting to walk in find the vehicle you were told is in stock - Wrong!

If you are expecting not to go through a 5 hour grind - Wrong! 

If you are expecting them to honor a price that they agreed to over the phone - Wrong! 

If you are expecting that they will not use your trade in vehicle hostage to keep you from leaving - Wrong! 

If you are expecting to find the price of the vehicle to adhere to the viewable window sticker you saw on the internet without insane dealer add on like ""Shark Repellant Spray"" or ""Super Duper Fabric Protector"" - Wrong! 

All in all, this dealership is a  semen stain to the Ford name and is a disservice to loyal clients and until Ford realizes this and puts people like Kent Hobelman back into the petri dish he came out of, they will continue to lose market share.

56,"April 26, 2017","Like any car purchase, the dealer works with you to get the deal done. And Tomball Ford excelled in that measure. Andre in the used car department was superb from me first walking on the lot through financing. However, after the purchase was made the service at Tomball Ford was far from excellent. I was promised a second key fob for my vehicle, great, only problem you have to show up at the dealership on a Tuesday morning as they have a 3rd party contractor program the keys. The problem with this is that you and everyone else that needs a key are waiting to be in the front of the line. Seems to me that if you are going to sell a car you should get a second key made before hand. Also, the vehicle I purchased didn't have a bracket for a front license plate. No big deal they will put it on when the plates come in. When I went to pick up the plates they told me to stop by the service department. Sure thing, only to find out that I had to go to the Quick Lane service area. After waiting a few minutes for someone at the Quick Lane service desk I find out they don't have any brackets for the vehicle in stock and they would have to order one. But, not to worry it should be in by the afternoon and they would give me a call. Will the afternoon came and went with no call. Finally a few days later I drove back to the Quick Lane to inquire about the bracket. Sure enough, it had come in. The only problem now I would have to wait to have the bracket installed since they only have 1 technician that can install them. In total it took 3 days and an hour of waiting to get the license plates installed. Again, this seems like an issue that could have been resolved before the vehicle was sold since all vehicles in Texas require a front license plate. While the complaints may seem frivolous, but in an industry that prides itself on customer service, I have to say that Tomball Ford dropped the ball after they get their money. This review isn't being written to complain outright as much as Tomball Ford requested the feedback. I do know that I will think twice before I go back for my next vehicle purchase as there are several Ford dealerships in the area.",3.6

76,"February 20, 2017","To the point then ill go into detail on my experience. 
•	Horrible customer service at the parts and service and offered no rental while it was going to take 3 weeks for them just to look at the car
•	low grade sales and finance employees.  When you think of snakes in sales, these guys are the epitome
•	I know 4 people who have purchased a vehicle from these guys and each and everyone have all said the same, horrible experience in the purchase and then with the service and parts department.  Don't buy into what you are seeing here.  Reality doesnt tie into this.  Look at the yelp reviews and then google.  Id even say google has been littered with false reviews.

My experience.  I wanted the focus st and they had the build I wanted.  My sales rep started the dialog by saying, I dont care what I sell this car to you for, you will be walking away with it today.  Typical procedure ensued, test drive, credit run etc.  So we go to start talking numbers and I said very honestly, I want to pay X for this car, this is what I have for the down payment and I had a trade in and was asking a modest X$$ for that.  I said, at the interest rate you have that would put my payments at X per month which I absolutely will not go above.  Sales rep says of course let me submit it.  And of course comes back with a much higher monthly payment.  I said, no, I told you what I have and I refuse to go above it, so just be honest and tell me if you can do it, if not, no biggie, we just wont reach the deal.  Comes back with yet another offer higher.  Let me say I know this is typical.  I get about 6 different deals of putting down more money, or financing for 6 or 7 years instead of 5 etc etc.  I say no and am ready to leave.  Then the manager comes out.  Young guy, and says look, cant you just pay more, my sales rep is having a hard time, just pay some more.  I say no, and that I have been honest with you from the start.  You can make the deal or not.  He says, come on man, not sir, he is having a hard month just help him out here.  I say, what I am hearing is no, and thank you for the time but I cannot pay more.  I get dirty looks and he leaves, then the sales rep comes back and says more or less the same, so I stand up to leave and he goes back for one more offer and they finally accepted my initial offer albeit very grudgingly.  At this point I see the manager shaking hands with other folks who have closed a deal and thanking them, he wont even look at me, all for sticking to my offer.  Then I get back in financing and the older (I wont even call him a gentleman) says, congratulations sign all the paper work.  As I am doing so I see my payments are 20$ higher than what I negotiated.  I ask him why and he says well you are still getting a good deal.  I say okay, I'm done.  Everyone there knew what I was willing to pay per month and for how long and they tried to stick it in at closing.  So he says, what are you trying to waste everyones time.  I say the opposite, they have been wasting mine and Im about to leave.  He says hold on, makes a call, and says okay we can get your payments back to XXX.  Finally done.  

5 months later I have to take into for a small oil leak around the turbo.  They said it would be 3 weeks till they can look at it and I have to leave the car there and they I dont qualify for a rental.  I asked to ensure warranty should cover the service and the rep says, maybe leading me to think they would try and snake out of taking care of the finances on what should be covered.  I called Joe Myers and they took in my car during a super busy time and knocked it out in 2 days.  They asked why I wasnt going to Tomball so I could get a rental and the rep was shocked that they wouldnt give me one, because Joe Myers offers rentals to all folks who purchase through them.  They apologized on behalf of Tomball and explained how their current manager has super high expectations on their levels of customer service and it shows. I was completely satisfied and regret so much not shopping a different dealership.

Casey was very knowledgeable in explaining the differences between each truck and pointing out all the features and their uses. We were able to test drive the trucks as well. I appreciate that Casey wasn't pushing either of the trucks but instead, he figured out what I would be using the truck for, what I wanted in my personal vehicle and helped explain how each vehicle would fit into those ideas. After I settled on the truck I wanted, the process from there was pretty quick and simple. There were some quick negotiations done and the price I received is one I am very happy with. The financing was great and I feel like everyone thing was trying to help me get the deal I wanted.

It was very clear that Jorge focused his attention on my needs.  He asked me what I was looking for, and in a matter of minutes, he was looking at his books to tell me what was on the lot.  And after 25 minutes of us discussing the vehicles, there were a couple questions that he didn't have the answers in his books; therefore, he went out to the lot and provided even more great information.  We made a 2 PM meeting, and when we got there, the vehicle that I told him that I was most interested in seeing was clean and waiting at the front door ready for us.  Jorge answered all of my questions, my wife's questions, and my son's questions.

129,"August 03, 2016","Scam artists! DO NOT PURCHASE A VEHICLE FROM HERE! I was screamed at & berated by a condescending salesman named Scott Fulmer who challenged my intelligence and spoke to me like I was an imbecile all because I had complained multiple times about a car I recently purchased (used) that was riddled with problems since the first day I bought it! Firstly, I have less than perfect credit. He offered me one car and told me that was the only one I qualified for. I saw other cars I liked that were in the same price range (some even less expensive) yet he could not manage to get me approved (allegedly) for them. He then misled me originally stating the vehicle was a 2014 GMC Acadia when in reality is was a 2012! He told me it had a screen which was also NOT TRUE! No biggie, I really needed a car, plus he had already ran my credit a thousand different times & started the process with this truck. Fast forward, I picked the car up 7/11 (although the contract says 7/9...thank God I had other documentation stating the true date of delivery) and once I hit the highway the car started shaking and had a huge windshield chip. In addition, the car did not even pass inspection when it was delivered. It wasn't ""officially inspected"" until 7/21. Anyway, I notified Scott that moment on the highway that my car was shaking/jerking and about the windshield. He told that I'd need to wait for the windshield repair guy and come back later that week & he'd have his technician check out the vehicle. When I came back to have these issues checked, I was informed that the windshield had already been ""sealed"" and that his tech said the car was driving fine and maybe had a few glitches because the battery had been recently ""replaced"". I trusted him & the Ford brand & accepted his explanation. Turns out that wasn't true! The car broke down 7/25! I was literally stuck in a parking lot at 11pm & had to pay for a tow company to tow my 2 week old vehicle to my home. I had to then spend $70 on a battery charger just to get the vehicle to turn on! 14 days after I paid $1400 on a down payment & hadn't even made my first payment!!!  I took the car to Autozone & an outside mechanic because I felt like I was being deceived in regard to the car having ""no issues"". Autozone ran a diagnostic that showed there was LONG TERM MEMORY PROCESSING ERRORS INTERNALLY & it failed the EDM (not sure what that means). It also reported more mileage on the vehicle than there was on the odometer!!! In between that time I was noticing the functionality of the AC just wasn't right. I would be sweating in my car with the AC on full blast. I could only use it on the face setting, everything else blew hot air. Took it in again & Scott again talked to me like an idiot stating things like, ""you do know this is a used car, right"", would not let me speak to the mechanic myself, & asked me ""what are you doing to this car?!"" He claimed the tech cleaned the filter (not sure why that wasn't already done) and proceeded to lecture me on how AC works in cars and not to expect too much. He then told me to  ""go away,"" & walked off. Over the month of July I brought the car in at least 8 times back to TOMBALL FORD and was told every time there was nothing wrong with the vehicle. I was never able to speak directly to the mechanic & had to rely on the hope that Scott would communicate the issues effectively. On 7/25, when the battery was replaced (which was supposed to have been the cause of all the problems...), I was issued a rental car for about 4 hours & told the car was in working condition. Throughout this entire period (7/11-present) I still noticed the jerking, but was told that it was all connected to the battery. Today, I went there to pick up my tags. While I waited, the check engine light started flashing and the car began to rumble again. I tried to call Scott, but he was unavailable. I went ahead and drove over there to see him sitting outside smoking a cigarette (as usual). I approached him and tried to inform him about the vehicle and he told me to take it to a mechanic and that his company would not do ""anything else for me."" I asked him if this dealership was in the business of selling lemons and he got irate. He was over talking me, shouting so loudly that he was shaking, causing a scene in front of the building with his coworkers standing by. He told me I ""didn't understand basic principles"" and continued to insult me and my intelligence. I asked him if he felt so comfortable talking down to me because I was black. He then brought up the fact that he had to work so hard because of my credit...I asked him if that gave him the right to take advantage of me? He screamed ""we're done"" and told me he wasn't married to the car. Uh duh...I reminded him that he worked for a reputable dealership & that people trust the brand but he was so irrational. I walked off in tears. GMC informed me the car has severe motor issues (longstanding).",1.0

131,"July 22, 2016","Jorge Lopez is the epitome of a no-nonsense sales associate.  I recently traded my 2013 Ford F150 King Ranch on a factory-ordered 2016 Ford Edge Platinum, both bought through Jorge.  I wasn't sure which model Edge I wanted so Jorge took me out in both the Sport and the 3.5L.  The Sport was really zippy but the interior is all black: not so good in hot Houston!

We toured the available models and looked over color-options to determine if my color scheme made sense.  Once that was done the rest was straight forward!

The car build was delayed slightly but arrived early.  Jorge kept me abreast of the car's status from start to finish.  He even did a YouTube video of the car after it was detailed the day before he delivered it to me.

Jorge bent over backward to do anything possible to make my car-buying experience fun and informative.  When he delivered the vehicle, he walked me through every option and setting possible to make sure I'd know what I was doing before leaving for home.

He'll be selling me my next car.",4.8

160,"February 06, 2016","Tomball Ford Dealership

Save  yourself grief from being ""nickeled and dimed"" to death plus the cat and mouse games of the con artists in finance, go somewhere else.

Firstly, I understand nothing is perfect in buying a car and I know dealerships have to make a living. This 2016 Explorer I purchased from Tomball Ford is the 19th  car I've owned. I've been in dealerships many times and I understand there are games and tactics. 
I'll spare my detailed complaint of the sales person who had a attitude throughout the process and didn't know 4 features the SUV had in it (which we specifically asked if this certain Explorer had during the test drive)  I discovered a few days ago the vehicle was equipped with them. 

I'm mainly writing this as a heads-up for others.

After hours of haggling out a sales price and right before finance, there's a ""after-market"" ""rep""  that comes to you with paper-work for a ""apex"" tracking system (I told all of the sales people many different times, for hours, before this rep came to me,  I didn't want the Apex system) it was somewhere around $700 
I refused to initial anything this after-market guy had for me in his paperwork for a charge for the Apex system and a monthly tracking fee!  
He got an attitude with me with his tone stating the system pays for itself; he then left and he also denied already being aware that I already said I didn't want it. (My sales-guy was talking to the After-market Rep, right before the Rep came in to get me to sign!) 

When the salesperson came to me to tell me to go to finance,  I had been there for 7 hours. 
My credit score is in the low 700's. 
After meeting the finance person, he puts a piece of paper in front of me with options for financing. 
Column One option for financing was 2.99% with a extended vehicle protection warranty for $525/month. 
Column Two option for financing was 3.99% without extended warranty for $545/month.
The games began...
I kept asking over and over, ""why I had to buy an extended vehicle protect plan to get 2.99% interest rate""
The finance person became completely aggravated with me for not dropping the issue and finally told me, """""" I have coupons with the credit union you're financing through and I can CHOSE to use them or not""""""
So, there it was, out there in the open, he wasn't going to use his ""coupon"" (lol) for a 1% lower interest rate for me unless I agreed to put the extended warranty for $1600 on the loan. 
During this time I kept asking for them to take the Apex system off the contract. 
This is when both, my salesperson (that was in finance office) and the finance person both got heated as they told me ""ok we'll take it off but it's going to be a $350 charge to remove it from the car"" 
During haggling over these issues on the contract, the finance guy was slamming his hands about in frustration and upon leaving the finance office no one would help us (me and my wife)

We stood in the showroom for 10-15 min, then we were brought the keys and the Explorer was parked just outside the door. The sales person gave my wife the key and that was it...

We weren't introduce to anything with the dealership as far as Service Dept or a walkout to the car and not even a kind farewell or a walkout. We both felt extremely unwelcome from being obviously ignored from everyone.   
So yes, I bought the car, they got me.....they knew my wife really wanted the car and I was backed into a corner. 
I called two weeks after the purchase and spoke with the finance manager, I told him all of the above, he had nothing to say, except to justify the Apex tracking system removal charge of $350 and the tactics of the finance guy for holding a better interest over my head, that wasn't available to me without buying His Extended Vehicle Warranty.  I asked him why the finance person refused to give my a copy of the ""finance options column page"" he said that was an ""internal document and he couldn't give that out.""  There was no sensitive information on this paper, from me, or the dealership, just payment options and interest rate options.
I also asked for a copy of the ""lower interest rate Coupon"" the finance person gave my Credit Union to get me 2.99% instead of 3.99%, he told me """"""""I'm not going digging through your file to find it""""""

So, if you are shown the ""column page"" with finance options ( which I'm sure is common thing ) ask for a copy of it, lol. This is when the finance guy will start getting pissed.  (This is the page that puts the extended warranty in the lower interest rate column.

I get it, I know it's sales, but when someone refuses over and over, it's time to stop and NOT have an attitude with customers. 

So they won, they got few hundred for the worthless Apex Security Tracking System and a few hundred for the Extended Vehicle Protection Warranty. 

But they lost out on me coming back this month to buy my truck. 
Seems there's more profit in extended warranties and worthless tracking systems than the Vehicle",1.2

163,"December 30, 2015","I can't say enough great things about Sierra Rodriguez. She kept in touch with me for three months, sending me different options to look at on-line. She finally sold me on one used truck. I drove for 1 hour and 20 minutes from my house to the dealership, two days before Christmas. Sierra had already left for the day, but assured me that they would negotiate the price when I arrived. When I got there Chris Jones assisted me with a test drive, getting my trade in value and showing me the buyer worksheet with the price. After being told that they were looking to clear the lot and would work a ""deal"", they (Adam Caridi) offered me the exact same price that was on-line. When I declined that offer, Adam told Chris to send that truck to the auction tomorrow, in a high pressure attempt to scare me into buying it. I then left the dealership and that truck sitting on the lot. The price dropped two days later from 29K to 25K on-line.  Chris called me the day after the price drop and said the Manager, Adam Caridi had decided to offer me the truck for 27K, which is what I had offered at the dealership. I had to advise Chris that the price was actually now listed at 25K while he was offering 27K. I told Chris that I felt they were not trustworthy and said that it was now a ""principle over price"" issue and I no longer wanted to deal with people like that.
With all that being said, I always heard great things about the new car sales at Tomball Ford and I can personally vouch for Sierra Rodriguez. Ask for her if looking for new vehicles, but stay away from the used car area!  You've been warned.",1.5

THEN we found one at Tomball Ford which meant a two-fer for us: the potential of buying a great truck and an opportunity to deal with, in our opinion, the best car guy in the Houston area.
We sent Jorge a note and got a phone call back from him where he told us all about the truck. We made an appointment for the next day... the rest is history!

215,"April 21, 2014","I bought an F-250 from these guys last year and left a great review.  I was thinking about trading in my F-250 for an F-150 for convenience-based reasons that are not relevant here.  I called Greg Hall, the salesperson I worked with last year. 

He told me that he needed some things from me, and I took care of it promptly--within minutes I had gotten him the payoff on my existing truck and had completed a credit application online.  My credit qualified me for the best possible rates.

I OFFERED TO COME IN if I needed to.  Greg instructed me that I could contact him via text, and I contacted him multiple times, seeking an update and asking if I should just come in.  I called and left multiple messages.  Hours pass . . . nothing.  Radio silence.  This took place on a day off of mine, which I do not get too often.

Finally, about an hour before closing, I called and asked the receptionist for a manager so that I could just kill the deal, and a miracle occurred: Greg picked up the phone.  Greg's response to my frustration was something like ""Well, I'm gonna take care of the people sitting in front of me first.""  Keep in mind that I had offered to come in multiple times.  I never got an apology from Greg or the others--just that Greg had sold four cars that day and basically had no time for loyal customers who refer customers to Tomball Ford and who are returning to buy another expensive truck.

Tomball Ford impressed me last year by owning up to a mistake and fixing it, but their behavior on this occasion made me realize that they are no better than the rest of the pack.  I will just shop around for the best deal available and only buy from Tomball Ford if the best deal is available there . . . . but I'll use another salesperson.

I should also add that like the other dealers, Tomball Ford advertises their vehicles with all of the rebates applied--even those that only apply to buyers using Ford Motor Credit.  However, UNlike Planet Ford and other dealers, Tomball Ford does not make it reasonably clear that these prices reflect rebates that might not be accessible to folks using their own financing.  This is VERY SHADY.  ",1.0
216,"March 28, 2014","Christian is an amazing guy and does a great job with the sales process.  He made the process so simple and it was very stress free.  I would recommend him to anyone.  Once he handed me off to finance, the process went downhill quickly.  

The first guy I dealt with in the finance office was obviously not very interested in my business. He was too busy texting and answering his cell phone.  While it was Valentine’s Day and he made the comment that he had to keep the wife happy.  I don't really care, my time is just as important.  He was very pushy and tried to confuse me and wouldn't give me time to review documents before pulling it out from in front of me.  I told him I was leaving and will come back later.  So then they tried to keep me prisoner.  I asked for my keys and was prepared to call the police if they didn't return my keys.  The new car sales manager, Carlos Barreiro, came over and asked if I would spend a couple minutes with him.  I agreed and he took over the finance process and I signed the sales contract (intent).  They had to bring the car in from another dealership so I went back on the following Wednesday to pick up the car and requested I not deal with the first guy I had in finance.  
Tim Harless was a great guy in the finance area and he took care of business.  Was very professional and personable, he let me review documents to make sure they matched the original agreement.  The only thing he did was forgot to have me sign the finance agreement so the following week I had to go back and sign the documents again and they offered a free tank of gas for coming back.

The delay in paperwork caused a delay in payoff of my trade-in.  I went ahead and paid another payment on my car just to make sure it wasn't marked as late because it was due on the 24th of February.  

When the dealership finally got around to paying off my loan, they called and got a current payoff and ended up paying off less than the sales contract agreed upon.  I had my refund from Ally by the 10th of March and it was for $7.37.  I called Ally and questioned why I didn't get more and they noted the payoff they received from the dealership was less than the agreed upon amount.  I called and the switchboard operator put me to the voicemail of Tim Harless.  Another note here, their customer service is severely lacking.  They should ASK if you want voicemail not just send you to voicemail.  I never heard back from Tim.  I called my Christian, my salesman, and he got with the director of finance and informed me that once they got the title they would issue a refund.  

I question in my mind whether if I would have said anything if they would have refunded it or kept it.  So on the week of the 17th of March, I received my promissory note with the stamp of paid from Ally and today is March 28th and I'm still waiting on a refund from Tomball Ford.  I called today to talk to their customer relations manager, Ginger Husch, and she could care less and was not interested in talking to me at all. She passed me off to Christian, the salesman.  I really hate that NO ONE at this dealership will take responsibility and show some customer service besides the salesman.  All they care about is getting me off the phone and out of their ear!  

I received my refund check today, 3/29/14, from the dealership for $3.25.  I’m not really sure where that figure came from but I am owed $302.44, which is the difference between what they were supposed to pay according to our sales contract and the amount they actually paid.  The amount of my loan is the same amount as quoted in the sales contract so nothing changed here except the amount Tomball Ford should have paid off.  Now I am back to arguing with them.

223,"February 02, 2014","OUR EXPERIENCE WITH TOMBALL FORD HAS NOT BEEN A PLEASANT ONE. THE UPFRONT SALES PEOPLE WERE FRIENDLY. OUR PROBLEM WITH TOMBALL FORD IS THAT WE BELIEVE THEY ARE DECEITFUL AND DISHONEST. WE CAME IN TO PURCHASE A TRUCK FOR A GIVEN PRICE. I BELIEVE THAT WHEN YOU SALE A VEHICLE TO SOMEONE, ANYTHING THAT IS ADDED ON EXTRA SHOULD BE REVEALED TO A CUSTOMER UPFRONT. THE MAIN PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE FROM THE FINANCE DEPARTMENT.  AFTER OUR EXPERIENCE WE LOOKED AT THE COMPLAINTS FROM THE BBB AND THE REVIEWS FROM TOMBALL FORD ON THE INTERNET, AND FOUND THEY WERE CONSISTENT WITH OUR SITUATION. A PRICE WAS AGREED UPON AT THE FRONT AND THEN WE WENT TO FINALIZE THE SALE. OUR FIRST PROBLEM BEGAN WHEN THOMAS KEPT ON ASKING US ABOUT THE EXTENDED WARRANTY. WE TOLD HIM NO TWICE. EACH TIME HE LOWERED THE PRICE. THEN HE ASKED US IF WE WOULD ACCEPT THE WARRANTY FOR $650.00. WE FINALLY SAID OK. THIS TOOK OVER $1000.00 OFF THE PRICE. HE CLAIMED HE WAS MAKING ADJUSTMENTS IN OTHER AREAS OF THE CONTRACT TO OFFSET THE PRICE OF THE WARRANTY. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN A RED FLAG RIGHT THEN TO US BUT IT WAS LATE AT NIGHT AND WE WANTED TO GET THE DEAL DONE. OUR CHIEF COMPLAINT IS THAT AFTER LOOKING OVER THE FINAL NUMBERS HE DID NOT TAKE THE $1000.00. HE SAID HE TOLD US ABOUT AN UNDERCOATED SEALANT FOR $499.00 AND A FABRIC PROTECTANT FOR $499.00 AFTER I CONFRONTED HIM WITH IT. HE SAID THEY AUTOMATICALLY ADD THIS TO ALL OF THEIR VEHICLES. I TOLD HIM IF YOU DO, THEN THE CUSTOMER SHOULD KNOW UPFRONT. IT SHOULD BE SEEN ON THE VEHICLE, ON THE UPFRONT SALE LIKE  THE BEDLINER WAS, OR AT SOME POINT OF THE SALE. THIS DID NOT HAPPEN.   WE WERE TOLD THAT AUDIO AND VIDEO TAKES PLACE ON ALL OF THEIR SALES. SO FAR TO DATE THEY HAVE REFUSED TO SHOW US WHERE THOMAS PLAINLY SHOWED THIS TO US.

226,"November 10, 2013","I was helping my brother and his wife look for a car so we came here today by recommendation from a salesman at another dealer. He recommended that we speak to a lady named Jenna (might be misspelled). We told her our price range, she was indeed friendly but probably because she was trying to get us above our price range which she did. 

To make a long story short I rated them OK for customer service and good from friendliness because of Jenna. But I also rated the Quality of work bad because of her. Reason being is that she knew our price range and had no interest staying near that price range. 

Now to the Ugly. We were there early in the afternoon but had to leave to come back. We made it back some time near 7pm to negotiate price. We were told the car was somewhere near $15K earlier in the afternoon by Jenna with no definite price and she said that she would work on getting it down. I waited outside during the negotiation process and came in to look at the final numbers.

They agreed on $14,427.00 at $349.00 per month with a $2000.00 down payment. I did some rough calculations and estimated he would be paying a little over 42 months on the car.  When I saw the negotiation sheet it said 66 months. I believe the interest rated turned out to be 17.99%. My brother has no credit history so I expected something like that. But that still not the UGLY.

I am looking at the numbers and still thinking it is a little off. So I pull up a mortgage calculator on my phone and the monthly payment should be lower than what we were given. So when we go to speak to the financial guy we bring up our concerns about the interest rate and then I asked what is the amount of the loan (because the numbers still looked funny) he says $16,000.00. WHAT! After that the guy tries to convince us to add a warranty and gap insurance which takes the price up to $400.00 per month.

Eventually my brother tells him he wants to try to try to get approval from another bank at a lower interest rate so of course they bring in others to try to convince us. During that time I ran the numbers again because I am lost with this $16,000. I asked the next gentlemen who came in what the tax rate was and he said it is 6.25% for the state.

So a car that has a base price of $14,427 at a tax rate of 6.25% totals $15,328.69 minus a down payment of $2000.00 equals $13,328.69. ($14,427 X 1.0625 (taxes) = $15,328.69; $15,328.69 - $2000.00 =  $13,328.69) Car Max estimates that title and license would be less than $100.00. 

So what that means is that they were charging us for the original price of the car and they lied about reducing it to $14,427.00. When I tried to ask more details about this the first guy kept ignoring me and the second guy kept going on about him not getting a good interest rate because of no credit history. Then I kept asking the second guy and he said well the $16,000 must have included the warranty and gap insurance. I told him that that was not true because I spoke to the first guy about this price before he ever mentioned the warranty and gap insurance. Then the price went up after he added the warranty and gap insurance. 

It was for this reason I rated the overall experience and Price as very bad. The lied about dropping the price and tried to get us to buy it at original price without noticing.

Total Rip Offs!!!

BTW we were looking at a 2008 SUV I believe it was a mazda.

231,"March 28, 2013","The basis for my very good review is simple: Tomball Ford (""TF"") (specifically, Thomas and Greg H.) recognized that their dealership had made a mistake, and they worked very hard to rectify it.  That is something truly commendable because true integrity does not shrink away when the poop hits the fan.

I went in on the first day fairly uneducated about what my positiion needed to be, but I permitted TF to value my trade and we worked up some numbers on a '13 F-250 diesel.  The original salesperson said they could get within $70-$80 of my requested payment, and in all fairness, my requested payment was too low for the truck I was pricing.  I just did not want to over extend myself not knowing what some of the other variables would be (i.e. insurance and APR).   However, the initial estimate was based on the assumption that APR would be Ford Motor Credit's ""special rate"" of 5%.  The salesperson indicated that management was willing to get even closer to my desired payment if they knew I could meet in the middle somewhere.

So, I lined up insurance and financing and agreed that I could come up $50 per month, meaning that we were now $20-$30 away from a deal based on monthly payment.  I contact the dealership and my original salesperson is absent.  I speak with Johnny W., who remembers me and says something like ""oh yeah, I remember that we were close to a deal.  It should have been a deal.  Come on in and we can take care of you.""  I told him I would be there in about 20 minutes, and he said to see him.  So, I go back to the dealership, and Johnny greets me at the door, introduces me to another sales person, and disappears for the rest of the day.  

So, the new salesperson is Greg H., who is underpaid no matter what he makes.  He of course has my file with my trade info, desired payment (now just $20-$30 off of TF's earlier quote), and the information on the new truck we have been working with the whole time.  Greg H. goes back and talks to the manager and comes back with the first number which is approximately $100 higher than the estimate from two days prior and based on the same assumed interest rate.  Admittedly, I lost my mind.  I had already spent over three hours at the dealership two days before and now the estimate is $100 higher than we left it.  Although I knew it was not Greg H.'s fault, he unfortunately was there to hear the rant, and I am still sorry for it.  On this truck, TF finally gets back within $20-$30 but it is on a lower-assumed interest rate.  So, everything that I was told two days earlier was bologna and amounted to a tremendous waste of breath and time.  I was furious and ready to walk.  After all, the reason I was there was the great treatment I got from TF's service dep't on my other truck and because of the OUTSTANDING knowledge that Ralph M. had on the super duty.

I tell Greg H. that it is unfair for him to take the punishment for the mistakes of his management and ask to speak to the manager.  It was surprising at first, but Thomas came out and greeted me, and he candidly stated that he had no idea about the discussions two days before but that he could not reach the previous figures based on the same assumptions.  At this point, I had already spent 5 hours at the dealership total and had gotten nowhere.  However, Thomas asked how TF could keep my business, and I said he can get a truck from somewhere else and make it work (even if it were a prior year model for which more rebates may apply).  I went back to work, and within a couple of hours, Thomas and Greg H. had found something and made it work. 

I signed the paperwork and bought an extended warranty for a very competitive price.  I am sure TF still made money, but I searched exhaustively on ESPs and the deal I got was very competitive.  I still have not gotten the truck, but I am confident that when it comes in it is delivered, it will be as advertised and perfect.

The moral to the story is if you screw up, man up, own up to it, and try to make it right.  Everyone makes mistakes but NOT everyone admits to it or tries to correct the mistake.  Because of Thomas's and Greg H.'s tremendous display of integrity, TF has now guaranteed that its service and sales departments will continue to get my business and my referrals.  My full thanks goes out to Thomas, Greg H. and Ralph M. for making it work.",5.0

They were trying to charge me for the alarm they said they install on their trucks for insurance purposes and ""paint protection"".  One was around $395.00 and the other around $ 495.00.  We had negotiated that the alarm was to be included in the price and the finance mgr had just shown me a piece of paper that had the wording on it that alarm was included.  Furthermore I asked them if the alarm was in fact installed on the truck. He showed me the computer screen that indicated the alarm was installed, but they had to check.  In fact, the alarm HAD NOT been or installed (as the computer indicated) ,,,,or REMOVED!!!  Either way 1. It was to be included in the sales price 2. They were trying to charge me for it 3. It wasn't even installed and I had to schedule a time to come back for installation.    I won't even go in to the extensive dialogue about trying to sell me the extended warranty!!

Chase answered the questions that I needed answering and has followed up with me after the delivery.
Carlos in financing was very helpful with the final choices on the purchase.

When service was required the Tomball service department always told me what was required and what will need attention in the 
future.   They gave me the option.

I must have come in 5 or more different times...when Glenda was not there Dave took care of me.  When Dave was not there Glenda took care of me.  They worked with me as well as they worked with each other and that told me a lot about this dealership and how they work with customers.  It was not about the cut throat sale...it was about the customer service and the interaction that counts in hard economic times. I wanted someone who was going to help me find what was best for me in my situation..not just sell me a car.  Thank you Tomball Ford for bringing the care of a small family dealership back to the community.  It was a pleasure to be helped by such wonderful people.  Glenda and Dave you are a great team and that is what I needed...a team to search all of Houston to find my car and then worked a price that made that car be parked in my driveway!

244,"May 30, 2012","I have been buying personal and commercial trucks, cars, vans  and SUV's from Tomball Ford since about 1999. The dealership has a great vehicle selection on hand. In the last few years my sales guy was unavailable due to an illness and we ran into Jana Baker (new car sales).  She hit the deck plate running and we instantly felt a sense of ease and no pressure atmosphere about buying another new car, we have since bought 3 new trucks.  Jim Baker in service is as honest as they come. He will call you and let you know what is wrong with your vehicle and why you should fix it and then give you several options to choose from. I have been to a few service stations and didn't like what they told me nor their prices. Tomball Ford not only told me that there were no issues and if there was an issue, it was sometimes cheaper and came with a longer warranty.  I will only let Jim Baker and Tomball Ford service my vehicles even if it is just for an oil change or state inspection. ",5.0
245,"April 16, 2012",I found it very enjoyable to work with Thomas and Nicole when we bought our new Fusion. We are very happy with this car. The main reason for buying a Ford product was that the Ford Motor Company did not have to be bailed out by our government but made it on their own the way this country was founded to do business by taking care of their customers.,4.8
246,"April 15, 2012","Reason for the visit was also ""Service or Auto Body"".  We have dealt with Tomball Ford for the past 19 - 20 years.  We have purchased all of our vehicles through Tomball Ford as well as working with the Service and Body Shop.  I completely trust Tomball Ford in every aspect from Sales, Service, Financing, Body Shop to just dropping by to visit.  We have always been welcomed very warmly and we have the utmost admiration and respect for each employee at Tomball Ford.  Although we have mainly dealt with Jana Baker during our last purchase of a vehicle, we realize that there are so many employees behind the scenes that are champions also.  I met Jana Baker for the first time when purchasing my 2012 Ford Edge.  I was very impressed with her knowledge and expertise.  I was not in the market to purchase a new vehicle, but while having my 2003 Excursion serviced through Jim Baker at Tomball Ford, I was introduced to her.  I asked her about the new Ford Edge vehicle and when she was finished showing me the showroom model, she proceeded to the lot to show me some of the other vehicles on the lot.  As with any of my visits, I have always felt comfortable with the sales and service staff and one of the things I admire and respect most is that none of the staff makes us feel unwelcome.  Jana Baker, as well as Jim Baker and all of the employees that work behind the scenes are all an asset to Tomball Ford!  KUDOS to all of them.  ",5.0

He confirmed the vehicle was in their inventory so I asked for a price.  He came right back with the price.  I had done quite a bit of research so I knew the price he quoted was fair.

The car wasn't even able to be jump started so we took the battery to be tested.  I was told it was 98% charged but would not be able to start the car due to the lack of crank amps.  I paid $104.74 for a new battery.  I called today and spoke with Jim Baker about it because it was noted on my invoice as a weak battery.  He stated that the technician had informed him there was no problem with my battery.  Jim then proceeeds to tell me all he can do for me and my troubles is to offer me a free oil change.  Within two days my car has stopped running twice stranding me and has cost me my $100 deductible along with an additional $104.74 for a new battery.  I understand the battery would not have been covered under my warranty but I didn't even receive a phone call explaining that a new battery was recommended.  If the battery was fine, why did my car completely die after only starting it about 3 times to the point where my lights would not even work nor could it be jump started.  I will not use this dealership ever again and I will be sure to inform family and friends about the type of customer service practices that I have encountered.

268,"January 08, 2010","Tomball Ford Bruce Pinkerton RIP-OFF DEALER. CAR ONLY RAN 27 DAYS. Stole $4452 from Single Mom that found work after 7 months no income financial assistance which also resulted in her vehicle being repossessed. On 11/28/2009 we bought a car from Tomball Ford because a friend recommended them. My daughter lost her job of 2 years, after enduring a high-risk pregnancy, which she was plagued by hypertension and developed a heart condition. She found seasonal and part-time work during the recent holidays. She was hired for 3 part-time jobs and needed transportation, since one job was in Katy, TX; one in Pearland, TX and the last job required visiting multiple HCCS sites to administer tests (she lives in Central-Houston, 30 miles one-way from Katy).
She went to the dealership and fell in love with a used 1999 Toyota Camry Solara. We made it very clear to the Salesman that she needed a good and reliable car to get to work. She had no funds so I borrowed $4000 from my Credit Union to help her. She did not have her insurance card with her, so we were told to purchase the vehicle in my name. Twenty-seven (27) days later (not even 30 days), the car made a loud noise, there was a burst of white smoke and it shut off on IH-45 North @ Greens Rd. She was stranded on the freeway, by herself on Christmas Day. This was a very frightening experience for her. I had to have the car towed. 
Since then, I have had two mechanics look at the car. I was told that the car blew a rod and knocked a hole in the motor. I was also told that the dealership had to have prior knowledge because according to their CARFAX Report, they had recently changed the oil (September 28, 2009). The mechanic said that extremely heavy grade oil (which usually last 3 months) was used to camouflage the motor problems. Tomball Ford's response was ""the car was sold AS-IS"". My daughter missed work on December 30, 2009 because she could not find a ride. She lost her job in Katy, TX on New Year's Eve. The seasonal job in Pearland is scheduled to end She does not get hours because she has no vehicle. The job with HCCS is scheduled to resume January 11, 2009, however, she will lose it, too because she still needs a vehicle! Do not buy cars from Tomball Ford! Their only concern is profit. I asked if they thought it was fair to incur a debt to pay $4500 and $571 for insurance for a car that only lasted 27 days. The Executive Assistant's response was that they had lost $400 on the vehicle.  We loss over $5000 and a vehicle.
I am giving this rating because to date (01/08/2010), I have received no response after mailing two letters of complaints (one certified the other by regular mail). I have since found out that this dealer has a history of deceptive sales tactic and fails to address complaints.

Ask the sales rep to check on financing even thought the mileage was @184K and even signed to have our credit checked. we alos agreed on a drive-out price of $10,314.70 and still have all paper work. Sales rep told us they could not finance due to mileage.  Told rep we would be back Monday to pick up truck just a matter of telling the bank, Sales rep replied, ""don't worry we are closing in ten minutes we will see you Monday.""  We went back out to the truck looked it over again then went back in and shook the salesmans hand and confirmed we would be back Monday.  Went to dinner and my wife called back to speak with the salesman and was told he ahd gone home for the day. When she described the truck the person on the phone told her the truck was being sold at that moment and they were leaving with the truck.  We were told not to come back to the dealer because they were shutting the gates.  We went back anyway drove through the new car entrance because the used car entrance was indeed closed and locked. The sale rep met us on the sidewalk and said ""Mrs. Rainer I know you are upset but it is out of my hands and there is nothing I can do about it, they went over my head and I know it is not right"".  Yes my wife told him this was B.S. and told him she wanted to speak to the sales manager.

The used car sales manager who I think was Bruce Pinkerton (we have a bookout sheet that stats it was prepared by Bruce Pinkerton) walked out, did not introduce him or identify himself and simply how are you and my wife said ""not to good"" and he said in a very abrupt tone ""what's the problem"".  When we told him why we were upset he simply said everything on our lot is for sale.  I said to him so if I wanted to purchase a vehicle and left to get the financing and some one came in they could purchase the vehicle before I returned. The sales manager simply stated that everyting on this lot is for sale and if they had cash yes they would sale the vehicle. I told him that with his attitude that it is a wonder he sells anything. He stepped toward me got about a foot from my face and said MY attitude!  I said yes your attitude and advised him to back up. I am not a violent person, but even I have limits. I assured him this complaint was going to go above his level and he said ""fine I hope it does"" showing little respect for senior management. We have heard three stories concering the sale of this truck; 1. There was a deal working at the time we looked at the truck and the individual had to go to Brenham to get a cashiers check (you don't get a cashiers check on Saturday afternoon in Brenham TX.)
2.While we on the phone during dinner the sales rep told us that an individual walked in and counted out 10K in $100.00 bills and drive the truck off. This salesmans name was David.  3. We had our daughter call and check on the truck the following Wednesday and she was told the deal had just went through and the individual was coming to get the truck that day.
I returned to the dealer ship on 11.30.2009 to complain and only spoke to the new car sales manager. While I was leaving the dealer ship I drove around behind the usse vehicle office and found the truck still there. It has been over a month and I have heard nothing from him.  I had a live chat with my concerns and was assure the internet sales manager Greg Gunn would be contacting me.  There has been contact from Greg Gunn.  I still have all of the paper work concerning the truck and your dealership should still have our signature on file with us allowing our credit to be checked.  If not our credit was ran without our approval.  A sales rep named David came out to the truck and was startled when he opend the door and my wife was sitting in the truck telling her mother about the truck that we had just bought.  The sales rep wrote down the vin number and left.  I really think it was know at that time we were not going to ba allowed to purchase the truck.  ",2.0
