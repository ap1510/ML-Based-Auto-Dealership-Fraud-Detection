2,"December 17, 2019",Horrible experience. I have a Honda fit that had a recall for the air bags and the Lost motion spring broken. I called and made an appointment and told the guy on the phone that I had a letter that said I could get a rental car until it was fixed because the air bags we're a death issue. He told me that they would order the air bags and bring it in Tuesday and they would fix it and discuss the rental car if I needed the motion. Spring replaced. Well asked for the rental when I arrived to make sure they were gonna issue one because it said I could get one and he told me I never mentioned it in the convo on the phone. When I told him I did he argues with me and talked over me the whole time telling me that I never said that and called me a liar. This is by far the rudest service manager have ever seen in my life. If I didn't have to deal with this person I would never go back. Now the car salesman we're amazing thou they were super friendly and extremely nice and I give them 5 stars as I would purchase a car from them. I just would make sure that I would take it to a different place to have any work done on it.i have never been called a liar by anyone that was titled service manager. He was extremely rude. ,1.0
3,"May 28, 2019","I own two identical Honda Elements, 04 and 07, and both require clutch replacement (both have the same symptom) . Element 2007 went to Gillman Honda in Richmond TX. Element 2004 went to Kelly Grimsley in Odessa TX. 
Element 2007 was fixed with a clutch kit plus associated labor cost, never mentioning any transmission replacement.
Kelly Grimsley's service advisor wanted me to replace the whole transmission. And he quoted me $1500 for a salvaged LKQ transmission alone, in addition to bushing, clutch, pressure plate and associated labor. 
Needless to say, I paid $165 as it was classified as inspection fee and took the car to Christian Brothers in Midland. My final cost covers a clutch kit, flywheel, transmission oil and Christian Brothers' labor, which is SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER than what I have been told at Kelly Grimsley.
I have been driving manual transmission for a very long time (30+ years), and I know the replacement of transmission is completely uncalled for. There are ignorant people in this world, but I'm not one of them. I'm sorry, Kelly Grimsley!",1.0
4,"June 19, 2018","We went and told the salesperson our budget,  That lasted all of 10 seconds!  He processed to go on and tell us he needed to run some numbers to give us an “estimate” of what my don qualified for.  This guy took information and without consent ran a credit report! Then tells us my son doesn’t wualify for a pre-owned car but DOES qualify for a BRAND NEW CAR!  AMAZING, right?!?  Proceeds to push a car that is double the budget amount!  Got out of there ASAP!  Went to Freedom  and got my son a VERY NICE used car! If I could give NEGATIVE STAR RATINGS I WOULD!",1.0
5,"March 24, 2017","This place seemed inviting .. reassuring.. and friendly as you walk in..... UNTIL.... there's work to be done... This is not regarding the SERVICE men in the back... The mechanics... but the LAZY .. LIEING... RUDE... WANNA BE HUSTLERS that try to take advantage of a woman that they thought was clueless to their scam.... IDIOTS..
I was told I could take proof of ownership and VIN number to my car to buy a key for $75 with code  and $150 to program vehicle to be able to start car with replacement  key... I didn't have to haul my car to receive code according to them.... but not only did I haul my car to finalize all these up and downs and run arounds and false hopes to get car going but, I even took a replacement key I bought for programming... ok.. so no.. they said I shouldn't use key I bought...I'd be better of paying the $75 for key they have in stock.. so I leave car ... go eat... realize some time later there's a missed call from dealership... wouldn't you know... The idiot on the other end of the  line informs me that machine cannot read my car to get code because my hArness and wires have been messed with too  many times.... then instead of wanting to charge me to program key they had in stock.. they wanted to charge me for key I took... after I was told I shouldn't use it...SMH... and because my car couldn't be ""read"" they couldn't give me code.... supposedly but wanted to charge $70 for the key I took.... wanted to hook up car to.machine to determine why it wouldn't program and charge $155.. but not including  parts the machine was going to determine I needed..... SMH......I told her I wasn't paying a penny for key I took.. she then tells me both keys were programmed.... but machine still can't read a code... something fishy about that... it was 5 o'clock I advised her I wasn't going to.pay a penny ... no code.. no key replacement.. and car was not programmed.... she advised me I needed talk to a manager.... ok weird... we hang up up and she calls right back to tell.me that they usually close at 7pm but they were closing early that day a at 5pm and I had 15 min to pick up car....either they weren't expecting us to be that close.... or they realized they weren't making no money off me.. needless to say... it was in their best interest I didn't walk in to retrieve paper work and key for car...not only did they not charge me for the suppose work on my own key but not even a manager came out. to explain anything or to demand payment of those $70 they claimed I owed for SERVICE.... BOGUS....
So I hauled car to ensure no more run arounds and no more stops for anyone else to program key.... and all it did was hurt my situation instead of making it easier ... 
BUT ONLY CAUSE THESE PEOPLE WERE SCANDELOUS.... I forgot to mention up I n arrival... no one came out to help us unload car off of trailer... push it to park it .... or did they come outside to get paper work and VIN number like I was told after going inside to use restroom and asking them if I should bring paperwork in... he said he'd be outside in a bit... went back inside to find him not at his desk... but I did encounter his plate with 3 slices of pizza... so I asked the female moron if she could please take my paper work and key because we had more stops to make... she was the idiot they used to try to milk me...

6,"May 10, 2016",Horrible experience! We were ready to buy putting down half in cash for a new car. They told us the lowest interest rate we qualify for is 8-9%. Payments they were showing me showed more like 20% interest rate. I really wanted a Kia Sorento too. Lucky for me my husband went to Lubbock at Gene Messer Kia. They got us in the exact car I wanted at 2%. Payments are half of what KG showed us!,1.0
