1,"July 30, 2019","Just want to give a shout out to Garlyn Shelton VW for taking care of my girlfriends VW Beetle when we took it in for repairs. Excellent staff and thank you to Brandon, Ronnie, and Steve for making it all happen!! ",5.0
2,"July 24, 2019","Very disappointed with the unprofessionalism in their service department. I leased my first Jetta with this VW in Temple and my current Jetta with VW in Waco. Living in Nolanville, it is more convenient for me to have service done in Temple. I called in advance and specifically requested to schedule service when I could get a loaner so I could get to work on time and be able to run errands if needed while my car was being serviced. I was assured a loaner would be available for me. When I arrived I was not greeted nicely, the man in the service department was rude and unprofessional, and they had no loaners available for me. He didn't even apologize for the inconvenience or misunderstanding and I now have to reschedule my service appointment. Huge waste of time. In the future I will save myself time in the long run and just drive to Waco. I will never use the service department at this dealership again.",1.0
3,"April 16, 2019","Great customer service. This dealership truly cares about their customers. My sales experience was amazing. I love how this dealership calls after the sale. The staff is so friendly, very professional, and family oriented. I highly recommend this dealership to everyone. ",5.0
4,"October 22, 2017","The customer service at this location leaves a lot to be desired. The workers in the service shop are particularly unhelpful. Caused personal property damage (broke back tail light), and gave a faulty report on what was wrong with my vehicle.

Quoted me at needing almost $2,000 in repairs for faulty drainage tubes. I inspected them independently and found that they were clogged and fixed the issue with a grand total of $0. Very shady business. 0/10 would not recommend.",1.0

8,"September 02, 2013","I took my 2001 Beetle to have a handful of different things done to it, the trans flushed, the a/c fixed and the keys programed. They said they would have a loaner car for me but it would be a few days, I went to the dealership and they had to rent one, that was put on my credit card, the weather was horrible out at the time and the lady at Enterprise said any damages due to weather wouldbe my responcability and sugested I purchase ins. $85.00 for two days....GS didnt reimburse me. When I picked up the car, the a/c wasn't fixed the keys ""couldn't be programed because the computers were down"" asked me to bring it back at a later date. When I returned at a later time shanty work was done. The a/c was later inspected to find wires pulled taunt and not ran correctly, they lost my power steering cap, the engine cover wasn't bolted down and a pair of pliers were left under it, the dipstick guide was broken, it was a horrible experience over all the car still has a few problems, JD...in the parts department is great, my husband has been doing the work and JD always finds us the right parts. I'm still waiting 3months later for them to callme when the computer comes back up. HMMM...",2.6
9,"May 09, 2013","This is my 3rd time purchasing a new volkswagen vehicle from this dealership. I am always greeted promptly by the staff. Cleadra was an excellent salesperson as she was very knowledgable in answering any questions I had. Eric, the finance manager and Ronnie, the sales manager, went above and beyond to make sure that I was comfortable in finding a vehicle in my price range. They also made sure that I got the exact color and model that I wanted. The level of service that I received from the sales staff has made me become a loyal customer to the Garlyn Shelton Volkswagen dealership.",5.0

11,"April 28, 2013",Ronnie is the best!  I would never work with any other person!  He goes above and beyond to make sure his customers leave very satisfied!  He made my dream of owning my first new car come true!  Thanks Ronnie! ,5.0
12,"February 06, 2013","I was looking for a car for my daughter that would hold its value over time.  I had an idea of what I wanted but was not sure if I should buy new or used.  Mr. Collins and Ms. Lowe were able to guide me in the right direction.  They were way more than accommodating to me and my in and out of town schedule.  They worked with my inexperienced daughter and made her feel confident about our purchase, that she was getting the very best car EVER!  Once we got the car, they took all the time she needed to explain the features and help her set up her preferences to her liking.  When she returned for her initial service appointment, they made sure she had a nice loaner so she could get to her college visit.  What a fantastic group of folks!!!",5.0
13,"January 24, 2013","We owned an 2005 Beetle a few years ago and decided we missed that beetle and wanted to purchase another one similar to it as a play car. We called Garlyn-Shelton Temple to see if they had a used new beetle on their lot that fit our specs. They stated that they did and we drove the 30 minutes to their lot to find a perfect match of what we were searching for. 

First, let me say that we wished we had never drove up there. Or I even wish we had just turned around. Its something we still shake our head about. 

11/2012: We were dealing with the salesman, Kevin, who didn't seem to know what was going on the entire time. We drove the used beetle, loved it. Gave them an offer and told them if they could meet it, to call us in the morning and we would come back to sign papers. They called and we came back up there, only to be told by finance that it wasn't indeed the offer we had made. They had increased the months of financing on it to offset our offer. No go, Garlyn-Shelton. As we were leaving the dealership, we were cornered by the salesman, Josh. Somehow Josh made the offer happen. We really liked Josh and his persistence and we signed paperwork that evening, with the fuel pump being replaced because of an oil leak that was detected. We also needed to order a paint pen for a minor dime-sized spot of missing paint on the front bumper. So the beetle remained at Garlyn-Shelton for several days while that replacement was going on. We were told they would drive our beetle to us 30 minutes away when it was finished. 

A few days later, we hadn't heard from them. Called Josh and inquired about the beetle. He said he would call us right back. He didn't. 

The next day, we called Josh, no answer. We called service and was told they would have someone call back. Nope. No call. 

That next day, we called and asked to be given Garlyn-Shelton's Dealership Manager- the one over ALL the dealerships. Our call was forwarded to Ronnie, the VW-dealership manager. I explained to him we needed to get in touch with the big general manager. He began asking what was going on and we talked a while. Very nice guy. Calmed my nerves a little bit and explained that he was the new manager taking over a very broken dealership. Said he would check into things for us. And that next morning early, we had a call from service department stating our Beetle was ready. Ronnie definitely got things rolling which we very much appreciated. So we drove in and picked it up because salesman Josh said he wasn't able to drop it off that day. No touch up paint or vase but hey, at least we had the car. 

12/2012: We call about our paint pen again and left messages on 2 different voicemails, no call backs. We call again next day and Josh said they were mailed to us. We never received it in the mail. We notice the beetle still has an oil leak. We take it to a local oil shop where they told us that it looked to be around the fuel pump. 

1/2013: Husband takes a look under the hood and there is a HUGE bolt laying inside a pan beside the fuel pump. We called VW and spoke with Wayne. Wayne scheduled it back in. Turns out, one of the main screws from the fuel pump had fallen out. Service placed screw back in and said that may fix the oil leak and to watch it. He also said they screwed up and sorry. So we drove it home. Oh yes, while we were there on that visit, we got our paint pen. 

The next day even more oil on the driveway. We drive the beetle BACK UP there where Wayne has service replace the entire fuel pump that they had just replaced. Everything is going good in our book. They are doing the right thing and fixing that initial problem to begin with with no arguments. But wait for it.....they washed our car with a pressure washer. It was beautiful all cleaned up! But our dime-sized spot on the bumper that I was working with the hard-to-get paint pen is now a BASEBALL SIZED BLACK HOLE with a dime-sized red center. Husband let them know he was not happy when he picked it up. Mike & Wayne in service had already left for the day. Hubby calls the next morning, speaks with Mike only to be told ""sounds like you should have the whole bumper repainted"". 

My paint pen is not going to TOUCH this baseball-sized spot with its new jagged edges from the pressure washer. We definitely do have to have it repainted now. You know, a simple sorry would have been adequate for us. We are not angry people. In fact, very patient and understanding people. But it seems like every time we drive to that particular car lot to fix your mistakes, something worse happens. 

We've never purchased a used vehicle before. But if a used vehicle purchase is like this, we'll definitely never do it again. And certainly not through Garlyn-Shelton in Temple. I feel like we've given them opportunity and opportunity to make this right. And would still love for them to! But this paint situation I feel like will be a losing battle. So we draw the line here and will never be back. Breaks our hearts because we are big Volkswagen fans and like to trade vehicles in every 2 years. We'll go elsewhere for now on. Garlyn-Shelton, if you're reading this, you guys are welcome to give us a call if you want to make it right. We're open to it. -McGinley Family

14,"January 23, 2013","I chose to give Garlyn Shelton VW a ""Great"" rating in all aspects, not only because I have been a loyal customer since the beginning of their VW store, but also because the customer service is always excellent - and it is consistent. Each and every time that I visited them for service with my previous VW Passat, everyone was friendly, courteous and efficient. ",5.0
15,"January 12, 2013","We drove from Dallas to Temple to purchase a special edition jeep at Garlyn Shelton.  We communicated during the week with Bob.  He was very nice and helpful.  We arrived at 9 am on Saturday January 5th.  The salesperson was Josh, he was very knowledgeable, charismatic and professional.  He answered all our questions in detail.  This was definitely a pleasant experience and I would  recommend the dealership.",5.0

21,"May 21, 2012","After 4 visits to have our 2011 Jetta repaired ( 2 visits to a dealer in San Antonio and then 2 visits to Garlyn Shelton, were the car was purchased), our car is still not repaired.  It has been two and a half months since we first  took the car in for repair.  After the past two weeks at Garlyn Shelton, Mike (the service manager) keeps telling they do not know what is wrong, they do not know how to fix the car, and they are waiting for an engineer from VW of America to help them.  They promised my daughter a loaner car, when we arrived no loaner car was available.  We had to get a rental car on my daughter's credit card.  Garlyn Shelton says they will pay the bill--we will see.  We finally gave up and traded the Jetta for another VW with less miles.  We arrived to pick up the car today and it is not ready, we came back later and the car is dirty, stinks of cigarette smoke, does not have a full tank of gas, does not have appropriate floor mats and we received no orientation on how the car works.  We did not accept the car as it was.  Now, they are suppose to clean the car, put in the mats, and deliver the car to my daughter in San Antonio.  I have NO faith that this is going to happen.  Thus far, our daughter has missed three days of work, she has driven from San Antonio twice, we have driven from Waco three times and WE HAVE NO CAR.",1.0
22,"December 21, 2011","Drive to Temple or Austin if you need service on your VW. I took my CC down for the 30,000 mile service. I picked up my vehicle 5 days later. The service writer was nice enough, but he was dipping and spitting in the trash can while he was taking down my information. DON'T take your vehicle to them. Its with the extra dive to Temple or Austin for better service.",1.5
23,"December 05, 2011","The service department is horrible. They get a few points for having courteous people on staff who apologized profusely for everyone else who doesn't know how to do their job. 

Our car sat there for 2 full work days before they even touched it. When they finally called us to tell us it was done, we drove the 45 minutes from Waco to Temple just to find that our car had trouble starting! They had done the planned work then failed to check to see if that fixed the original problem. 

No refund offered. Not even an explanation of what the residual problem was so that we could go tell a better (and cheaper) mechanic. We received no more than excuses and crappy service.",2.0
24,"October 01, 2011",Went to look at their TDI's talked with a salesman about what one would cost with the options we wanted. He told us an amount and said he would try to find us one. We came back the next day and were told that price was not including the options we wanted even though it was written on the paper that way. They try to game play and keep you tied up sitting there all day and give you the run around so they can pad the sales price. Not cool.,2.3
25,"December 16, 2009","The receptionist is quick to transfer you to someone's voice mail so that she does not have to talk to you.  When you ask her if there are other VW dealerships in the Central Texas area, she claims to not know, and she refuses to get off her backside and check a phone book to try to provide you with better service.  This is even after she knows she is causing her company to lose business.
When you leave a voice mail and ask someone to respond to you quickly, it will be 5pm or later before you are called back.  This is even the case when you call and leave a message around 8am.
I also asked the receptionist if their service department was still VW certified (because the dealership changed hands recently) and she did not know.
She was trying to get me off of the phone quickly so she didn't have to answer any more questions, and when I was asking my final question concerning a warrenty work letter I recently received, she hung up on me--without warning.  
I do not recommend this dealership.  Avoid it if possible.
