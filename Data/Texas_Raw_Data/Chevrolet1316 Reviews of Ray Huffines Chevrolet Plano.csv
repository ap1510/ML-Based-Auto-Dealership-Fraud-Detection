0,"June 26, 2020","Would give a ZERO if it was offered.  I have a 2013 chevy sonic. Decided to take it to Huffines plano for 2 problems. The 1st, the air bag light kept coming on. The 2nd, a/c wiring harness had a short at the wire connection. Already knew where the short was, just hard to get to. The service tech diagnosed both issues. The air bag light was, according to him/her, was due to a seat belt tensioner on the drivers seat at the tune of over $400. The a/c needed a new connector and recommended a drain and recharge at the tune of close to $200. The a/c worked beautifully other than the short. I chose to have them go ahead with both repairs although In the back of my mind I didnt want the recharge. When I picked it up at the end of the day, the air bag light didnt come on but the a/c was blowing 2 temperatures. Was cool when sitting at a light but got cold when the rpms were up. I brought this to there attention. They suggested bringing it back in. The next day, I dropped it off. They called me and said the the a/c was within GM specs, BUT the air bag light had come on while he was driving it. This time, said the wires were spliced on the passenger seat so soldered the wires together. So the 1st repair I paid for was the wrong repair. All they had to do was solder a couple of wires, but didnt reimburse me for the original repair. I was left with an a/c system that doesnt cool like it use to when at idle and paying for the wrong repair from the air bag light. Have had several of my coworkers where I work at said they wont go there from this experience. One person said they were actually looking at a new vehicle but backed out from the experience I had of the service dept. Was concerned about the service after the warranty was over with. While I was waiting for the car to be brought to the front, I had struck up a conversation with another customer that said he has had to take his equinox in to the service dept several times for the same issue and a wallet that was drained quite a bit over his visits without really getting the vehicle fixed.

The sales managers are great also, Matt and Chris! The financial guys are wonderful, Bryon and Jeff. I love this place so much, I bought 2 cars in December from them. Please get the wheel and tire warranty. I have already used it. ",5.0
2,"January 13, 2020",My new Chevrolet Malibu bought from Huffines Chevrolet Plano has required five batteries in six years.  The car leaves me stranded about once a year when the battery goes dead.  There was a recall for this very problem but Huffines never let me know.  According to the recall the Generator Control Module does not function properly in this car and causes a gradual loss of battery charge.  Instead of replacing the GCM like they should have they replaced my battery over and over and charged me for parts and labor.  Their service advisor says he is going to talk to their GM about my problem but he doesn't take my calls and doesn't call me back when I leave a message.  I've called GM and opened a case with them to attempt a resolution.  ,1.0

5,"August 15, 2019","So we get a GM letter in the mail stating that our car may have issues with code P0171 with rough idling so I call and make an apt. and was told by PAMELA.TINSLEY@HUFFINES.NET that a loaner car will be provided under special coverage. So I tell my son to take it to Huffines and when he gets there they tell him there are other codes as well as P0171 on his car and that they need to run a $49 diagnostic that we would need to pay. I say heck no just fix the P0171 code since that is what the letter says, nowhere on the letter it states we need to pay in fact it is free! Lets move forward to the loaner... again, PAMELA.TINSLEY@HUFFINES.NET told us the loaner would be covered and now the guy tells my son that ""Pamela shouldn't have told you that"" so now its our fault and my son doesnt have a ride and must sit for over 2 hours for them to finish!!!

12,"February 07, 2019","19 years elapsed since my last new car purchase, and I thought it would be a hassle. My first stop was at Huffines. Kimberly Corey greeted me as I entered and she systematically showed me what was available without the usual pressure associated with sales. The offer looked good, but I was determined to find something better. I did, but not without some pressure to close the deal immediately. When I asked Kimberly if Huffines could beat the second offer, she did. A lot has changed in automobiles in the last 19 years and to my amazement, Kimberly took extraordinary time to show me everything about he vehicle. Then upon pick-up of the vehicle, Chris Ninos also made sure I was comfortable with everything before I drove away. A wonderful, painless experience, pleasant sales staff and an excellent facility. Don't bother bringing something to drink - Huffines staff will offer you water at very turn.",4.3

He then went over the cost and rebates available for me and I feel got a good deal with me.  He handled all the interface with the manager and went with me to my home to have my wife sign where she needed to sign.  I had a good experience.

Also help me access  On Star and My Chevrolet. The offer sheets on the trucks I were interested in were excellent. This was definitely the best experience I ever had purchasing a vehicle. Beside all this she was able to help a little loss girl find her father. What more could you ask for.

 Jeffre was extremely helpful on the financial part. He explained all the programs effectively. He showed flexibility on how the down payment was to be handled.

19,"December 30, 2018","Awesome Experience at Ray Huffines Chevrolet Plano (and Steve Rutherford Rocks!)

About a year ago, I was looking to buy a red Corvette for my husband. I was grateful to meet Steve Rutherford at Ray Huffines Chevrolet Plano. He stood out from many folks I've talked to from other dealerships. He put intense focus on meeting my needs and showed me all the available options. When there wasn't a brand new red Corvette that could be delivered within my time windows, he helped me to check out a recent trade-in Red Corvette that was rarely used knowing he would not make commission on it. In the end, I bought a brand new Silver Corvette from him and a second brand-new Cruz for my son, because he is trust worthy, and truly put customer's needs above all. 

As a side note, we felt really good about working with Steve's manager Chris Ninos.  He made a good deal possible.

Truly grateful customer

21,"December 17, 2018","I’ve got in touch with Ray Huffines via internet on a Friday at night not expecting to have an answer by Saturday very early in the morning. After a couple of emails and a phone call I set an appointment @ 9:45 AM and, my surprise, the very car I wanted to test drive was washed, started and already warm for me. Long story short, around 1PM I was handing my daughter the keys of her brand new Chevy Spark.

23,"December 12, 2018","From the inception of the thought of a new vehicle to signing my paperwork, Sean Allen was there every step of the way to relieve any concerns and provide excellent peace of mind.

Because I work retail and the holidays are an insane time of the year, he was respectful of my time and stayed in contact with me in ways that were convenient for me. 

Any questions I had (and I had SEVERAL) were answered quickly and thoroughly. Language was written so that a novice could understand. And at every turn he was transparent with me to ensure that I was getting the best deal possible! He even helped me keep costs down and STILL find a model with even more features than I originally anticipated. 

He even went above and beyond as there was a gap period when I needed a loaner vehicle while my car getting some extra things done to it (that he also helped facilitate). And during this time, he understood I had some things to do, so he chose an amazing loaner that was perfect for the job!

Man, I tell you what... This is how car buying should be:

Open communication.
Shared vision/goals.
No hassle.
Trustworthy service.

Sean Allen is a rock star!

Thank you again for your time and effort.

30,"November 12, 2018","I had an unfortunate accident with a deer. I had it towed to the body shop and was awaiting a word on the insurance status. I looked at the new 2019's and asked if I could do a trade in once the truck was fixed. They said they could work with me on that. Long story short. The Body Shop and the Sales team worked together and made this happen so fast I could not believe it. 

This is my second purchase from Ray Huffines Chevy Plano and I would never want to go anyplace else. They treated me like I was a king. 

If you are looking for a new Chevy you really need to stop in and talk to them. They do not put any pressure on you and bend over backwards to meet and exceed your expectations. 

They have done that twice for me over the past 3 years, 

Oh and their service department and body shop will also bend over backwards if you need them. I will not take my trucks anywhere else.

Thank you Mike, Bryan, and Charles

31,"November 08, 2018","I was impressed with the quality and professionalism that Huffines Chevrolet of Plano extended towards me in my car buying process. Three people that were instrumental in
my choice of dealerships were Jeff Cambell, Dan Werner and Chris Ninos. They listened to my requirements and found the car that I eventually bought. A Chevy Traverse. They found it and brought the car in from another dealership . That is service in my book!

Please pass this on.

I used CarGurus to track down a used Chevy Volt.  Huffines has exactly what I was looking for - and it was CPO!  Don Williams was very responsive, courteous and answered all of my questions both via e-mail and over the phone.  They offered the Volt for a very reasonable price, and I was very pleased with Huffines’ offer for my trade-in. 
I live over 500 miles from Plano, so I had to do a bit of planning before heading on a grand, one-day road trip.
When I arrived, Don was there to meet me and show me the Volt.  It was spotless and exceeded all my expectations.  Don also did a great job of explaining all the warranty coverage and helping me with OnStar.

Thank you for everything you and your team did for me. You have made a lifelong dream come true for me. I wish my dad was here to see it. He would’ve loved the truck and would’ve been grateful for your help on getting it. The experience was better than I had hoped for. I emailed seven different dealerships in north Texas and you were the only one that responded promptly and continued to help me pursue my dream truck. Only one other dealership responded, but never again after the first.

From the bottom of my heart I am so very grateful. If and when we are ready to get my girlfriend her Tahoe, we will come see you at Huffines.

54,"July 23, 2018","My daughter wanted to buy her 1st new car, and was interested in the Chevy CUV, Trax, so we went to Huffines.  We initially were only ""looking"" but were very impressed with the salesman, Mark Ferguson.  After test driving a Trax, she was convinced that was the model she wanted, but not the color.  Mark located the black Trax she wanted at various dealers and arranged to exchange with the other dealership for it.  Mark took us to the Service department to ensure she understood the loaner car and maintenance process the dealership supports. Mark worked every discount she qualified for with the Financial Manager.  She even got an extended bumper to bumper warranty to ensure full coverage while she made the monthly payments.  They added additional tinting which really makes the car look great, and more efficient with the heat issues.  She could not be more pleased with her 1st new car.

So much that I've hated the buying process and car sales people in general. Sean proved that everyone is the same. When I was looking for my 2018 Silverado I spoke with 4 different dealerships and Sean seemed to actually care if I found the truck I wanted and if I was happy. The other guys didn't really seem to care or maybe because I came in with gym shorts and a Cowboys t shirt they didn't think I had the money to buy a new Silverado LTZ fully loaded. Like Julia Roberts said on Pretty Woman, Big Mistake!

This was, by far, the smoothest and relaxed vehicle buying experience I've ever had. On top of that Sean sat with me, Twice, and explained how every feature in the truck worked.

The aim of my review is to warn other customers about the fact that the inspections to the vehicles they are doing is not so deep and trustable since they weren't able to identify the problem (or perhaps it was better for them to sale the car in such conditions instead of fixing it). ?

201,"October 09, 2017","I had a great experience purchasing my new Corvette from Huffines Chevy in Plano.  The sales manager, Chris, got directly involved very early on in the process, so I didn't have to go through that whole Wizard of Oz, back-and-forth experience.  We hammered out a very fair deal face-to-face in a very short period of time.  The sales person, Sean, was very friendly and accommodating, despite the fact that the showroom lights were out due to a recent fire and we had to use flashlights.  A humorous anecdote: after I purchased the car and we were going through some of the included accessories, the sales person pulled out the package of black cloth 'covers' and the styrofoam things and told me they were to cover the removable roof and protect the edges of it, in case you wanted to store the roof it in the garage.  The black 'covers' are actually cargo shades, and the Styrofoam things are ceramic brake protectors for when the wheels are worked on, to prevent chipping.  But in truth Sean was very helpful, and if I buy from Huffines again I will definitely request him as my salesperson.  ",5.0

After several calls to representatives who told me things like ""bluetooth runs through the internet "", I had to post to their FB page to get actual help. After 6 hours in the service department, they were able to reconnect my Bluetooth and tv, and indicated the problem was that the body shop drilled through a wire in the roof during repair.  They said they would order the replacement part and have me back in the following week to fix it. Over a month later, still nothing.

We let him know we were waiting on a call from our insurance before we could make a decision and we didn’t get a pressure filled ‘you better buy it now’ reaction that we have received from other dealerships before.

I got back with Mike on Wednesday to check on a few things and within the hour he got back to me with the answers and we struck a deal. During my lunch break from work I dropped off some papers and let him know my wife and I would be back around 7:30 that night.

When we got to the dealership that night Mike had all the papers ready for us to go over and sign. Very quick process. Mike took us out to show us all the features on the Spark and answered all my questions.

We came back in to meet the finance guy and upfront we didn’t look forward to that. The last time we bought an auto at another dealership we had a very negative experience with the finance person. Anyway, Mike introduced us to Russell and he was very friendly and also had all our paperwork printed and ready to go over and sign. We are financing through our credit union and had already contacted them for that part also.

The process with Russell was also very quick and easy and no pressure.

This is the first time we have had a positive experience purchasing an auto from start to finish.

274,"July 18, 2017","Letter to Mr. Huffines, in response to his thank you letter:
Dear Mr. Huffines,

I am writing to you in appreciation for YOUR appreciation letter and the professionalism shown to me by every member of your team from my first phone call / email.  Starting with Darrell Rice, Gadiel Plaza, Jas Kalsi, Ken Labuda and all the others on your “pre-owned vehicles” team in Plano, I was shown consideration, excellent service and kindness.

Darrell Rice was the first one to reach out to me after I chatted with your online pop-up customer service team.  He followed up a few times via phone and then we met in person.  I thought I could only afford a pre-owned Hyundai, but mentioned to Darrell that what I really wanted was a Toyota.  He is a careful listener and because of that, showed me a Toyota Camry that had “just arrived” and we worked out a deal.   Darrell and Gad used all my financial parameters and did a great job of making the right deal for me happen.

I can’t say enough about the professionalism, consideration and kindness of your team.  Your leadership in your industry and the customer reviews are what drove me towards my choice of Huffines in the first place, and it was happily confirmed.  Darrell Rice is a super guy, and has done everything to “work out a few kinks” and get my car in tip-top shape due to my warranty.   I will be a loyal customer and recommend Huffines as the place to go if you want consideration of customers’ needs, honesty and professionalism.

He did exactly what he said he would in a timely manner. 
Also working with Chris and Bryce was a pleasure.

Looking forward to years of satisfaction with my new Tahoe.

Huffines still made good on their agreement by finding the same car at an unrelated dealership in Austin. They had to go get the car and ended up losing money on the sale but they made it happen (very quickly).

298,"June 22, 2017","On my last trip to DFW, I was badly rear-ended. I needed a car and I had already been researching, so I knew exactly what I wanted... Iridescent Pearl Malibu Hybrid with a black leather interior, double moon roof, and black bow ties.  This isn't something that most Chevy dealers have sitting around on their lots. I stopped into Huffines Chevy of Plano on the off chance they would have it.  Of course, they didn't, but they found it for me and got it to me that same day!

Sean Allen (Salesman) and Chris (New Car Sales Manager) were both extremely empathetic about the accident and helped me get the EXACT car I wanted off another dealer's lot.  Not only that, but they drove me 15 miles to another Huffines dealership, so I could test drive a hybrid they had since I had never driven the car I was about to purchase.  They wanted to make sure I was getting a car I would be 100% happy with.  I appreciate that very much.

Sean is a cool cat.  My car buying process was longer than your average one, so I got to spend some time getting to know him.  He is candid, honest, sincere, and just a nice fellow.  I highly recommend you make an appointment with him if you plan to buy a Chevy in the DFW area.  He shoots straight and I like that.  I can't stand people who are not direct and honest.  Bleh.

Chris Ninos is another great person to deal with.  He did everything he could to make me happy.  He didn't mess around at all with the pricing, discounts, incentives, etc.  He gave me the exact price I requested which was very fair and he got the car on-site in a matter of hours.  He was extremely busy that day, but still took the time to jump through hoops for me.

Russell Litchfield handled my financing.  He is another nice gentleman who communicates clearly, concisely and honestly (someone please buy him a new printer and release him from the horror that is triplicate paper...it's 2017).  He is very knowledgeable about banking practices and loans.  If you are financing your car through the dealership, ask for Russell.

Matthew Suttle from service chatted with me after I had purchased the car and was waiting for the shop to do their final safety inspection.  ANOTHER NICE GUY!  He assured me that if I had any issues with the car, I could come see him and he would take care of it.  Service after the sale is pretty darn important, so I appreciate this.

The visit was disappointing and the customer service was so poor, I hesitate to move forward in buying a new car let alone another Chevy location. I was then referred to Mark Furgeson through my credit union. From the minute a gentlemen welcomed me, I couldn't believe how relaxed and comfortable I was.  It was because of Mark, that I was excited to be serious again about buying a brand new car.   Mark was genuine and enthusiastic to go through every feature of the vehicle and share his knowledge from driving his own vehicle with options new to him as well.  I can't go without recognizing Eric Rea, on the management team. It was evident that I felt welcomed and was being treated with the utmost respect was very important to him.

345,"April 16, 2017","I have purchased several vehicles over the years at Ray Huffines and have always found Ray Huffines to be at the top of the ladder when it comes to everything they do. Their sales and service is hard to match and NEVER surpassed. I know when they tell me something they are honest and sincere, not out to make a quick buck.

We just purchased a pre-owned 2016 Chevy Malibu with Walter Segovia's help. It has just 8,000 miles on it and is a real cream puff. We got a much better used car than I expected to be able to afford. I purchased a new 2017 Chevy Sonic from Ben Siebel for myself last year and love it so I knew Ray Huffines was the first place to get a quality used car and we are very happy. 

I'm seventy years young and don't have time to deal with less than the best. That's why I shop and get service at Ray Huffines. I know if something is not right Ray Huffines will make it right. ",5.0
346,"April 15, 2017","Well on March 26,2017 I set out on a journey of uprooting my life from Boston, Ma to Plano, Texas to live with my son. It was a 3 day road trip in my 2016 Subaru Cross Trex with my daughter and 3 year old grandson.  The road trip was great with no issues and I arrived on March 29. Well on April 3,2017 it was my daughters last night here so she and my son decided to go work out one last time together. My son was driving my car and was attempting to take a left hand turn into a 3 lane heavy traffic. Well the first two lanes stopped to let him go and he proceeded into the second lane, stopped looked to the right, no one was coming so he proceeded across the third lane and was more then halfway into into the parking lot when a car slammed into the right rear tire engaging the car to completely spin around to the same direction as he started tapping a third car that was exiting the parking lot. Both air bags deployed my daughter was injured with a concussion, sprained neck and jaw and was transported by ambulance to near by hospital while the woman that hit them drove away from the accident scene no injuries. It turned out my car was a total loss, only a year old and still owed a huge balance. Also cause of my stupidity I did not have rental insurance on my policy. I also starting a new job April 17. In the mean time my son had to pay over 200 dollars a week for Uber to get to and from work. I was extremely anxious and nervous cause of not having a lot of money and not sure how we were going to survive getting to and from work. Was I going to have to pay for a rental myself due to the investigation still pending? After many days of research and reviews of different automobile nothing was striking until one night was watching the news and saw that GM Was the number one auto maker and I immediately googled GM near me and Ray Huffine popped up and the chevy Trax popped up (I did not want to go in a car) I instantly feel in love with the Chevy  Trax. Well the rest is history. Dan Werner and I connected on a Monday I told Dan my situation and at that point made plans to schedule a test drive for that Thursday. I emailed Dan and asked if we could schedule for Wednesday instead and he much obliged and even offered to pick me up!!(so I would not have to pay for Uber) I have to say Dan Werner is by far the most professional/funny auto salesman with a huge heart who took more then half his day to walk me through the auto buying process. I drove home that day with my chevy Trax which I totally love????Dan Werner took a huge burden off my shoulders that day and I will be forever great full and blessed. Thank you Dan Werner????

349,"April 13, 2017","I drove from Florida to purchase a Corvette in stock that was shown on their web. A sale of this type required some amount of trust from the seller and the buyer. I found Mark Ferguson to be a very honest person. I had to buy and leave quick as a major storm with hail was scheduled for noon. I arrived at 9:00 and was on the road at 11. We beat the storm all the way home. The sale with appraisal was a team effort so we met Chris the manager and Bryan the business expert. Their team really came through. The car was delivered well detailed and I met the young man who prepared it for delivery. Again a team effort organized by Chris.

He found me one right away.  That weekend we couldnt get in.  The next week he remembered and sent me another that had been brought in.  That following weekend we went in to look but before we left I told him we were coming in and I couldnt find anything online for under 8k.  He said one just was brought in the day before and he'd give for 7k.  The mother n law went in saw it and fell in love with it.  Darrell was so nice he even gave us more for her piece of junk than deserved he called it a gift.  We walked out only having to pay 1300 of which 300 was tax title and license.  It really was a good deal for the car compared to other cars id been looking at at other places.  As well he gave us more for her junk than expected.

It was a great experience all the way through the buying process- even the financing!! I will defiantly recommend to anyone looking for a Chevy truck or car to contact Eric at Huffines Chevrolet.,5.0

There was an awesome sale price on a 'top of the line model' advertised on their website, which they honored, and Mark actually worked with me during the financing and lease trade-in process to get me a LOWER price than I expected rather than the other way around.

I kept waiting for the experience to become the normal, stress-filled hassle it becomes at most dealerships, but it never did.  I got everything I wanted in a pleasant environment and in a short amount of time.

I will definitely be checking back in with them when it's time for the next car!",5.0

I would not purchase one until we had a carport installed. About a week later we received an email from Chuck advising he still hadn't found the red one. The blue one had grown on me. He worked up a deal on that one. We went in on Friday February 3 and drove home in my dream car. It was amazing and very helpful all of Chuck's knowledge about the vehicle and it's technology.

I asked my son to go and  check out a camaro which was advertised on the net. I trust my son's review on the phone and told him to get a trade in offer on my Hyandai which was done and accepted by me. Camaro price was right in my budget with the trade.
All I  requested was for Finance, to get the paperwork together for me to come in to sign the agreement and take possession of the car.
They waisted the whole day with nonsense requests and at end of day said they would not sell me the car as they feel it was for my son and not me.

It was a great deal. Eric Pearce explained he could get the seats refinished in leather and we took that option. After the upside down trade in was factored in along with the leather and the highest warranty and insurance options etc with tax title license, the final financed price was right at the original sticker price of the new suburban had it not been a low miles loaner. Eric was great, he took care of everything. I immediately sent my brother over. I can't say more than that I sent my family to the same person at the same dealership. ",5.0
421,"January 27, 2017","I have purchased several new cars from Huffines and had them all serviced at Huffines for well over 20 years.  Regardless of the reason for the visit (Sales or Service) each time the Huffines employees were always professional and always helpful.  If they did not know the answer to my problem they would find someone who did and connect me with that person quickly.  
My most recent visit was to purchase a new 2017 Equinox and trade in my old 2009 Equinox.  Eric Pearce was my sales person and did an outstanding job in taking time to walk me through the purchase process and all the new options and technology on the new car.  I decided to order a new car which was built in Canada and took some time to get to Plano.  Eric was kind enough to keep me informed on the new car status even through the Christmas Holiday period.  My last new car was purchased in 2009 so I cannot remember what that experience was like for a comparison but this experience turned out great because of how Eric treated me as a customer and how he continued to follow up through the entire process until the car arrived.  Once the car arrived he was as excited as I was and has continued to help me get comfortable with the new technology stuff in my new Equinox.

427,"January 21, 2017","The Huffines team went above and beyond our expectations,  We were in the market for 2 vehicles--one for me and one for my daughter.  We took an initial test drive with Huffines, and about 3 weeks later, in doing some research, I allowed a web site to share my information to get a feel for pricing, across dealerships in the area—to which I got a LOT of e-mail responses—one of which was from Huffines.  They did an outstanding job of simply taking my word for what I thought we wanted, and did what they could to locate them.  None of the other dealerships who responded to the web site inquiry gave me the same level of attention or help.

When we first settled on a deal for both vehicles, there was hope that my daughter's would be able to take advantage of a Bonus Tag discount of $1,000.  She is on a VERY tight budget, and this discount would just bring the total cost within her budget.  When I picked up my vehicle, I was told that she would not be able to get the discount after all.  We were very disappointed; but the Colorado was perfect, and the deal was hard to pass up, so she determined to go through with it anyway.  Unbeknownst to us, however, the Huffines team got together and found another way to give her the same discount.  You cannot imagine the thrill and gratitude when we picked up her vehicle, and they told us of the discount.

Huffines went above and beyond, in every respect, and they will be the first place we stop the next time we are in the market for a new vehicle.

Thank you, Huffines.",5.0

My first experience with Huffines (the Hyundai side) was incredible, and my second experience was even better. They really are completely different than other dealerships. Through the whole process they were clearly far more interested in keeping me in the family than making sure they were getting the best deal on their end. Everyone I worked with, from Sean (sales), to Ernie (sales), Chuck (sales), Chris (management), and Bryan (finance) were beyond helpful.

No one was pushy, or in a rush, and they all spent more than enough time with me to make sure my needs were met.

450,"December 22, 2016","So basically my old 4th gen Camaro got destroyed by natural disaster (Huge fallen tree) and my dad had been telling me to get a new 6th gen Camaro. I was reluctant to do this at first as none of my friends bought new cars before. Walked into Huffines and that was when I met Sean Sawyer. He was rather new to the profession but perhaps that was what made us connect really well. He explained about the 6th gen Camaro just the way I wanted to hear about it. He had nice little chats that exposed more similarities between us. I am sure that the other salesmen at Huffines are just as friendly as I could feel from the aura that greeted me as I stepped in. 

We eventually agreed on a bit of discount on the Camaro and I was suddenly a proud owner of a road beast! I wished Sean Sawyer the best for his career and I definitely want to see him successful as we were both young men who just started our careers.

I meet Dan Werner during my initial inquiry and he just focused on finding me the right truck.  It made getting to know him, the dealership, and Chevy-Trucks a lot easier.  We changed exterior colors and interior color several times.  Just when I thought that maybe I was asking for a truck that wasn't on their lot, Dan and his manager found one on another lot.  It had the right combination of options for me and my family.  What made this process more enjoyable was their relentless pursuit to include all of the special pricing they could find, some that I was unaware of.  

I have talked to several of my friends and they were all interested in my car buying experience.  I've driven Chevy trucks since 1997, and my last one lasted me 14 years without a major problem.  My 2017 feels like a whole new generation of pickup truck.

Dealerships that didn't want to make my first car purchase something special. Dealerships that didn't want to build rapport with me to gain my trust. 

From the minute I walked into Huffines Chevrolet, my experience exceeded any expectations. I wasn't expecting much, given my previous with various luxury dealerships. I was put in contact with Mike and from the minute I met him, I felt a sense of peace come over me and I knew this was the right place for me to purchase my first car. Mike put me at ease and let me know he wasn't in the market to make me feel pressured. 

I went for a test drive and fell in love with the car that would soon be mine. Mike crunched some numbers and we came to an agreement on price and I think I got a steal! I'm still very pleased with my decision of getting into my 2017 impala. I am much more pleased with it with all the bells and whistles that I would have been with a basic luxury vehicle. To me, this is luxury! The ride is second to none, the technology is top notch and the car is a head-turner. 

I'm pleased with my experience overall and have talked about it non-stop. Every time I get in my car and hear the engine, I smile from ear to ear and I'm thankful that Mike was the guy who walked me through this process! I cannot say enough great things about him and the experience Huffines gave me. I will be a lifelong customer!

472,"November 26, 2016","I had gone to Huffines Chevrolet to see about the Colorado pickups that were available.  I was introduced to Mr. Eric Pearce, my sales person and immediately felt at ease.  We talked for a while about what I was looking for at which point there was not one on the lot of my color preference.  He was able to look up and see what was coming in on the next car hauler.  A Red Rock Metallic Chevy Colorado LT was shown to be coming in.  Calling dibs on it, I told him to put my name on it when it came in.  A few days and several communications later, it was said to have come in.  Then it was said to be going through make ready.  I later got the call that it was ready for delivery.  I think Eric was just as excited about the truck as I was.  It was there, sitting in the out door show area under the lights.  The color of the truck appeared to be one of its own.  Truly a magnificent stand-out.  I felt like I had just hit the Jack-Pot.  Eric walked me through all the features and checked the truck over with me.
Eric appeared to me as a good friend and a great person to work with.  Bryan in Finance was also a great person to talk to and share stories with while he took care of the paper work.

I was ready to downsize from a full size Silverado, and this vehicle fit the bill.  Cory found this truck for me in Oklahoma, and went and got it.  It was a surprise when I saw it for the first time, it's much better equipped than I ever would have believed, and it was a beautiful red that I have not seen before.  It already gets better city gas mileage than my full size Silverado got on the highway.  Cory did all this with a lot of communication with me, so I always knew what was up and where we were, and he was great about it.

487,"November 09, 2016","    Eric Pearce represented my wife and I in the purchase of a Suburban at Ray Huffines in Plano. He quickly answered our internet request , and, based on terms that we greed on, we made the 360 mile trip to buy. Upon our arrival everything was exactly as he said. There were absolutely no hassles in quickly and efficiently completing our purchase. Eric was very knowledgeable and patient in helping us set up the technology in our Suburban. We felt very confident when leaving the dealership and immediately driving the long trip home. Eric was warm and professional from the time we met him until we left. He stayed late and even assisted us in locating a hotel for the night. My wife usually feels intimidated and overwhelmed when buying a car.

I sent a message pretty late that night and very early the next morning I noticed a response to my inquiry. Within a few hours Mark Ferguson had everything approved and ready for me to jump in the car and start my road trip.

Many dealerships don't honor their advertised prices or find other ways to take advantage of you during the process (i.e. offering you a fraction of what your trade is worth to offset their advertised price).  I received a fair value for my trade-in and the financing department worked to get me the best possible interest rate for my new car purchase.  Dan Werner did a great job getting my wife and me taken care of quickly and made the entire process enjoyable.

Bought from Huffines via phone and email communication with Taylor Fellwock and Bryce Bessler, having never seen the vehicle until day of purchase.  Went smooth, no hitches until options were added in service and those were due to the supplier and service tech.  Sales folks aimed to please and were great!!",4.4
537,"September 15, 2016","There are 3 professions I dislike, doctors, lawyers, and car salesmen.  After dealing with Bryce Bessler on leasing my new Equinox, I may have to retract the latter.  Bryce came highly recommended, and with good reason.  I live in Washington State, so my entire experience with him was done on line and over the phone.  I have never had an easier time with this process.  I originally was looking to lease a different vehicle, but with my budget it did not fit well.  Bryce suggested looking at it from a different angle, leasing a lesser vehicle now and work up to the one I wanted later.  It was a brilliant plan in which he was able to get me approved in a matter of hours.  He was prepared and diligent, having me email him all the paperwork and information he thought finance would need to get the approval, leaving no stone unturned.  As a result, I got approved without a hitch.  Because the leasing laws between Texas and Washington vary, he and his team wasted no time figuring out how to get the contracts written to accommodate the differences.  In total, doing everything online and by phone, I had contracts in my hand to sign in less then 5 days.  The vehicle was shipped right to my doorstep via transport, and Bryce walked me through the operation of the vehicle over the phone until I understood every aspect of my vehicle.  I even called him several time through the day with additional questions which he happily answered without a hitch.  In fact, I could hear his smile through the phone.  I will be leasing another vehicle from Huffines and Bryce Bessler in the future without question.  I was treated with respect and dignity, making this the most painless and enjoyable car buying experience I have ever had.  I cannot say enough about this young man.  I highly recommend Bryce Bessler to be your next car salesman.

Knowing that I was on limited time, Mark even made a USB drive loaded with FAQs and detailed topics on my new Silverado ahead of time. He was extremely friendly as well as knowledgeable and didn't make me feel pressured to buy in the slightest bit.  

Bryan helped us out on the finance/titling side of the deal and was by far the most pleasant one I've ever dealt with. In my experience, finance guys tend to be on the dry/bland side. Bryan interacted well with my kid, and my wife and I were impressed.

After talking to two different people, I was able to speak to a semi informed person. He needed to look at other things and called me back.

I had my heart set on a brand new fully loaded Silverado. My salesmen Erick Valdez, as well as his finance manager Bryan Etzel, worked every angle they could to try to get me into my dream truck. However, being a young first time buyer with no real credit history made it difficult. Instead of turning me away or just brushing me off (as other dealerships did) they got me approved for a brand new 2017 Equinox that I really love, at a very reasonable price/rate. What I appreciate the most is them genuinely taking the time to get me into a vehicle that I really loved rather than just make a sale or work over an inexperienced buyer.

608,"July 17, 2016","When I moved to Texas six years ago, I had to find service for my trusted old Saturn, and found it at Huffines in Plano. 

Once a car is purchased, what we are left with is the service department. As a woman, I experienced about 16 years of dismissive, disrespectful service department behavior from another auto maker...while they maintained a national fleet of company cars, no less! 

As a result, I became extremely sensitivity to dealership and service department behavior.  My Saturn was well cared for by Huffines and I have been treated respectfully and fairly. I have never felt patronized or financially preyed upon. So, when it came time to let my Saturn go, the decision to buy from Huffines and continue my relationship with Reggie Pimento and his colleagues in the Service Department and business office was an easy one. 

I just purchased a 2016 Cruze from Jeff Childre. I will not hesitate to buy from him again when the time comes. Despite my positive service experience with Huffines, as I walked toward the show room’s door I could not avoid the fear of being a woman alone at a dealership. Chicken entering the fox house? 

Mr. Childre and his colleagues put me at ease immediately. Mr. Childress addressed my concerns and needs professionally, respectfully and personably.  His knowledge of the car and his demonstrations were such that I almost do not feel the need to read the manual. But I will. I left feeling confident that I had made a sound purchase and with my dignity intact. Thanks, Jeff!

609,"July 16, 2016","Purchasing two vehicles at the same time, I asked each dealership I was working with to give me their best lease price up front with no opportunity for back and forth.  Huffines had the best price, with the exact inventory I was requesting and they were able to include some dealer added features at a good price as well.  Negotiations were very straightforward and refreshing.  They even went above and beyond expectations at delivery to make my daughter's first car a special event.  Bravo to the salesman, Taylor Fellwock, for making all of this come together.

There were a few items that need improvement but did not spoil the experience or keep me from doing business with them again.  Even though I was told all the paperwork was ready for me to sign before I came in, we waited over an hour before we started to sign documents.  Additionally, the vehicles ""make ready"" left a lot to be desired ... like streaks on the inside of the doors from installing the window tint ... and tire pressures being 5 PSI low on a brand new car.

Again, overall great experience.  They got the big stuff right and I would recommend them based on this transaction.",5.0

I emailed Mark to inquire if they still had the vehicle from Auto Trader that I was interested in and he was quick with a response despite the Dealership being closed that day(July 4th Holiday Weekend). Mark Ferguson let me know in his response that the Dealership was closed until Tuesday and that he would check the inventory 1st thing Tuesday morning. The dealership reopened on Tuesday morning and sure enough I had an email waiting for me from Mark first thing Tuesday morning letting me know that they had the vehicle available. I set up a meeting with Mark for that Friday. Upon arriving Manager Christopher Ninos and Mark greeted my wife and I and introduced themselves. They made sure we knew that we were in good hands and that they were excited for the opportunity to earn our business. Mark had already put in some work and had the car pulled around for us to look at and to test drive.

My normal advisor, Keith Overturf, happened to be off the day I brought my Yukon XL Denali in for A/C diagnostic and service before my upcoming road trip. Fortunately, Marc Henley was able to assist me in with the same outstanding service that I have come to expect from the Huffhines staff! 

My vehicle was taken in just past 7am and was ready by the afternoon even with the past weekend holiday and backup. I was ecstatic that I was able to pick up my Yukon the next morning. Unfortunately, the check out process was not as great as the service portion. Upon checkout I reviewed the ticket and inquired about a uniformed service discount. After presenting my ID the bill was adjusted but still did not look correct. When I inquired further as the line items did not match what should have been the adjusted total. Long story short I was speaking with Raul and he said that military discounts are only half the percentage that I have received on all of my previous visits to Huffhines. This still didn't look right to me so I just paid my bill and decided to speak with my trusted advisors. Although, I should've just asked Melva instead as she has always helped me in the past with such questions.

I became interested in a 2016 Silverado because of a promotion.  I thought if their service was so good let’s see how their sales department shapes up. Dreading the hassling and haggling I did my due diligence researching trade in values, manufacture’s invoice price, day and time of the month ready to do battle. The first impression I had was there was no gauntlet of salesmen to pass through. The first person I was fortunate to meet was Jeffre Childre.  He was warm, friendly and professional.  I told him what I was looking for. He told me what my trade in was worth and the price of the new truck. I took a look at my notes and threw them in the trash can. Deal done! It was that easy. Now just about anyone can sell a vehicle but how about service after the sale? On deliver of the vehicle Jeffre took an inordinate amount of time inspecting the truck and explaining it and its systems.  He has made several calls after delivery to see if there are any issues that needed to be addressed or any service that he might offer.

Jeff Childre is the man you want - especially if you are working your financing through a Credit Union.
We talked on the phone, he listened to what I wanted, and found the EXACT vehicle. They offered me a great deal but did not pressure me to sign.

I walked out with a new Silverado and feeling good about the transaction. From the salesman to the Store manager to the Finance manager - great bunch of people.

I went down to the dealership and the car was washed and ready for my test drive. I noticed a tire had some worn tread and they agreed to replace it. There were no surprises. Actually, the only surprise was that my rate was 5% lower then what they originally told me. Darrell was courteous, no pressure sales, didn't try to add on, or convince me to go in another car.

Not until I called and informed them of my profession, the truth came out and my 2015 Tahoe has major problems. Several internal engine components were damaged by broken off peices of metal chars. I was disappointed that the only thing that was done was replacement of broken components and not the replacement of the engine, because metal pieces are still in the engine causing more damage. Im completely dissatisfied with Huffines Chevrolet of Plano for the service experience of lying first until trapped into the truth. I'm also disappointed in GM Chevrolet Tahoe because of the major failure at only 25,000 miles, for such and expensive flagship vehicle.

I found a Tahoe that I really liked and wanted so Mark was able to put a hold on it for me until I could bring my husband in to look at it.  He also went ahead and had it washed (before we even had committed to purchasing it) so I could see the true color of its beauty.

I had to recently use another service center while out of town. You better believe my first call was to Keith for some expert guidance and advice with regards to the recommended repairs. Long story short, they did a fine job but did not measure up to the service I get at Huffhines with Keith. So in the end I fixed what was necessary to get me back home to where I could drop my GMC off to have Keith and his team look it over for this latest visit. I am glad I did because the techs were able to spot other service items before they became major issues. I was able to make an informed decision on my repairs and had every confidence that it would be completed timely as well as professionally!

Now comes the other part of repairs/service, payment. This is hard enough but with Melva Walton, whom I dealt with before on numerous occasions, just made it pleasant. Melva goes out of her way to make sure that everything is correct. I am an active uniformed service member and Melva made certain that I was able to receive a much needed discount off my total!

868,"January 13, 2015","I have a 2011 Chevy traverse that had a leaking water pump(falls under the drive train warranty 5 yrs /100,000 miles) I purchased my traverse from Ray Huffines but I have been going to Young Chevrolet because it is so close to me. When I first noticed it leaking took my car to Young they informed me that they were a week behind and maybe somewhere else could get me in sooner. I then took my car to a non dealership where the gentleman checked it and said it was the water pump where he gave me a quote and said they could get it in and out the next day or so. Then he suggested to me that it may be covered under warranty. I then called Young Chevrolet again and discussed this with them. Again with no other suggestions but to take my car somewhere else. So I called Ray Huffines and spoke to Reggie Pimento about the problem and he said he could get me in and out in a day I also informed him I did not live close and would need a rental car and without hesitation it was all set up for me on the following morning(which was a Saturday morning) From the moment I pulled into the bay I could see the customer service that this place offers. I met with Reggie who took all my info and got me into my rental and I was on my way. He called that afternoon after my car was checked and said they discovered my front engine mount was leaking and loose. He gave me a quote and I approved  the repair and also informed him I wanted my car detailed. He called me on Monday morning and said my car was ready. When I went to pick it up Reggie was at lunch so I had the pleasure of dealing with Frank Conti who was very professional and very nice. I asked if I could see my detailed car first and he located it and was happy to show it to me. I was amazed how clean my car was!!!It was like having a new car once again!! Then after  checking out my car Frank brought me over to the cashier who was the friendliest women I had encountered in forever, so full of joy and gratitude  and letting her customers know that it is people like us that keep her employed.

907,"August 21, 2014","Recently our family decided our midsize SUV was just not a good fit for our family and our current lifestyle.  We did a lot of research on size, gas mileage, options, standards, ratings and reviews and narrowed our search down to a few options.  One at the top of the list was a new 2015 Suburban.  Our family has not previously owned a Chevy vehicle so were unsure what to expect.  Our last 2 family vehicle purchases had not been good experiences and honestly left us absolutely dreading the idea of taking a Saturday evening to make this purchase.  We figured we would absolutely have to drag the purchase out to several weekends and several dealerships to get the right purchase at the right deal.  So after forcing ourselves to make the trip we were expecting a long drawn out exhausting trip.  Instead what we experienced was an absolutely easy, smooth, exciting purchase with only one stop.  Our first stop at Ray Huffines proved to be the best decision we could have made.  We were approached by our Sales Rep Ritchie in the parking lot.  He was professional but friendly and not pushy.  He was quick to ask what we were looking for and what we were interested in.  He took what we provided and suggested a test drive.  We test drove a fully loaded 2015.  It was a GREAT ride, but was more than what we were looking for.  Instead of pushing for an up sale and running us off (which is exactly what would have happened if he pressured us),  Richie took the time after the test drive to talk with us about exactly our needs, wants, and priorities.  He then went about looking at our options and walking through them with us.  He even went out in the pouring rain to bring up several of the vehicles on the lot so we could see the options in person.  After a quick look at a few we found exactly what we were looking for and wanted.  He made the entire process smooth.  He quickly transitioned us to the finance department where we again have had very bad experiences in previous purchases (Not Chevrolet) but everything went smoothly.  There were no hidden agendas, no silly games on pricing, extras, etc.  We were so impressed with their straight forward honesty.  Jas was fantastic to work with, especially after a long day.  It was amazing to us that such a large purchase went so well.  We love our new Suburban, our boys LOVE our new Suburban and we will definitely recommend Huffines and their staff!

931,"June 24, 2014","My wife and I purchased a 2000 Chevrolet Suburban at Huffines of Plano in November of 1999 and we are still driving it.  The vehicle is still in great shape and it still runs like it did over 14 years ago.  This we attribute in large part to the excellent service we have always received at Huffines.

We have never taken the Suburban anywhere but Huffines for service and we have always taken it in for the scheduled maintenance.  Jerry Taylor was our service representative for years until he moved over to the body shop.  Jerry was always extremely competent and friendly and we were always confident that he would not recommend something that was not needed.  He was totally honest and we trusted him completely.

When Jerry moved over to the body shop, he recommended Frank Conti to us and we have been equally pleased with him.  We trust him and his advice just as we did when Jerry was our service rep and we will continue to trust him to keep our vehicle in good shape.  Frank is very knowledgeable and easy to talk to and we always feel comfortable taking our car to him.

Melva Walton has waited on us more often than not when we paid our bill and she has always been very friendly and personable.  She is very competent and we have always enjoyed being waited on by her.  Just like thew other Huffines employees that we have dealt with, Melva helps to make the visit pleasant.  ",5.0

Keith takes care of me EVERY TIME I go and he makes sure I know everything I need to know to make the best decisions for my car...and my pocketbook.

May 23, I came back to the service department to get my Chevy Cruze serviced, and again meet up with Steve, and we looked at some other options and at that time they send Bryce out to help Steve in getting a sale, (Bryce was very helpful, however, not really needed at that time, But I do want to say thank-you to Bryce for all the input he gave us.)  Anyway, we worked out a deal on a New Chevy Cruze, did all the paperwork, however, the car was at an other lot so I was to pick it up on Saturday, but Steve call and told me that that car was already sold, so I went back down on Saturday morning to fine out what was going on, and again Steve and I walked around the lot and came across 2 Chevy Malibu's that I liked one Champaign color the other a White color, ( Hind sight, I should have taken the Champaign color it had a few more options like XM radio, which I thought the White one had also, but does NOT have, oh well it saves me some money in the long run.) Anyway, I ask Steve about a lease that I just seen on TV for $249 for 36 months, so he talked with Sean the (Birthday Boy) and he came out and said they can do a lease for $261 a month for 39 months which was OK with me, however, since I was there Friday for another car and did all the paperwork for that vehicle and to find out it was already sold, I asked if they could tined the car windows on the White Chevy Malibu, for my time I spend there at the dealership, and they agreed to that. So we made the deal, at the time we where doing the closing deal Steve had another one of his customers come back, and that is where Bryce stepped in and helped to deliver the Chevy Malibu, and walked me through of all the options on the car and help me to get the On-Star hooked up. On Tuesday, I got the windows tined, during the time that was getting done they let me have a loner car. I just want to say a BIG Thank-You to everyone that helped make this deal!  ",5.0

I know nothing about car repair.  I went there today for the 60,000 mile maintenance, and (because of ""Car Talk"" and other advisors), thought I needed new brake pads, timing belt, and other expensive maintenance.  Frank Conti was my service manager, and he advised that I wait for the diagnostics before making any decisions.  I planned on spending $1500 and the service was less than $350.  Everyone at Huffines is great, but Frank gives the kind of customer service that makes women who know nothing about car repair feel secure.  Bravo, Frank.

The entire experience with Huffines in General was wonderful - the web check in was simple and awesome, and everyone was very friendly and helpful when I dropped my car off. Frank talked straight, was informative, and always humored my (many) random questions about the repair. It was a warranty repair, but I was also pleasantly surprised that I received a nice, new loaner without having to ask. I knew that the repair would involve a fairly extensive amount of labor, so I told Frank when I dropped it off that I wasn't concerned about the time frame, as long as expectations were communicated.  He went above and beyond with keeping me updated and managing my expectations with the repair. I always appreciated knowing what the progress was and trusted that they were taking their time (meaning, the RIGHT amount of time) to make sure the repair was done correctly the first time.  The cherry on this spectacular service sundae was when I picked up my car, they took care to make it look just as good (if not better) than it did when I dropped it off.

I visited my local auto shop (Frisco Automotive) and they recommended that we give Huffines in Plano a try. 

During my first visit, Mike Massey found the same issue that Stonebriar found - my keycode was not in the Chevrolet system, so it looked like I'd need a new lock cylinder.  Mike was extremely helpful, although we didn't come to a resolution.  I decided to have Huffines replace my lock cylinder.

Enter Keith.  Although it took a couple days, Keith went ABOVE AND BEYOND in trying to obtain my car's key code - and he located it!  Instead of spending several hundred dollars to have my lock cylinder replaced, I only had to pay for the key code search and the new keys - under $100!

The sales staff and service advisors have never been anything short of professional, considerate, helpful and efficient.  Today I appreciated the help from Suzie Frazier and Melva Walton.  Thanks for making taking my car in for service a very pleasant experience.  Top notch people all the way around.",5.0
997,"April 06, 2014","This is the second car I have purchased from Ray Huffines of Plano.  I recently was in a wreck and hit broadside.  My car was totaled.  I work full time and needed a car ASAP.  Shane Dove sent me a letter suggesting I come in and see the new Impalas, so I did. Mr. Dove asked Travis Kilcullen to show me some cars.  When I got in and sat down in the one I finally bought, I fell in love with this vehicle.  Travis explained all the new changes made to this year's vehicle.  I had an Impala (2010) and this car really blew me away.  After I purchased the car Travis asked me to come back after work and he would explain how everything worked and help me to get familiar with the new additions.  He went the extra mile to help me out and I really appreciate it.  Thank you all for making my search for a new car so pleasant.  I tell everyone I know to go to Ray Huffines in Plano first!

998,"April 06, 2014",The oil change and tire rotation was done in such a short time.  I was truly prepared to wait.

999,"April 04, 2014","My experience was outstanding BECAUSE everyone I met was both pleasant and professional.  It's a pleasure to do business with a dealership where it's apparent that everyone truly cares about making you happy.  That's what Huffines Plano does consistently and that's what makes them successful.  And because they're successful, you can see that they're happy, too.  Lot's of smiling faces there and Melva Walton stole my heart while making me laugh!",5.0
1000,"April 03, 2014","  Having my vehicles serviced at Huffines Chevrolet is done with confidence that the work will be performed per specification with quality and satisfaction.  The Routine Maintenance items and more ""complicated"" repairs are initiated and completed efficiently and in a timely manner.  Susie Frazier usually performs the line service write ups  and Melva Walton brings in the receipts.  J.R. Lopez answers some of my technical inquiries, and John Limbocker handles my special parts requests.  Evan Pace does a great job processing the State Inspections and routine Oil / Lube Service.  AND.. Steve Gandy stands by in the wings to solve the unsolvable .. whenever that rarely transpires.....

  Thank you Huffines Chevrolet for taking on the Saturn vehicle line for service and parts.  Much appreciated...

1001,"April 03, 2014","My recent service at Huffines was a wonderful experience. Typically, I dread going to get my vehicle serviced because of wait times and the overall hassle of bringing a vehicle in and maintaining my daily schedule. 

In this case, the Huffines team members (Susie, Shirley, and the Service Tech) had me in a loaner vehicle quickly and even had my vehicle fixed quickly as well. They also pointed out the problem and potential problems that I did not see. After all was finished they had my very reasonable bill taken care of and had me back out the door to complete my regular daily schedule. 

Great all around experience at Huffines. I have purchased many Chevys in my days and would highly recommend Huffines Sales and Service as the one-stop go to Dealership.

Pleased Customer,

1019,"March 14, 2014","I was previously at Jupiter Chevrolet but recieved such poor service I had to find a new dealer, do not ever go to Jupiter Chevrolet. Fortunately Ms. Frazier has been my service advisor since coming to Ray Huffines over  a year ago. I feel confident my car will recieve the best evaluation and care as well as her customer service is impeccable. Ms. Frazier is the sweetest person anyone could want to meet. If you go to Ray Huffines Chevrolet ask for her and you won't be sorry. 
On my last visit I also worked with Ms. Walton my cashier advisor, she was very nice, answered all my questions and showed sincere interest in my satisfaction with the service department, I appreciate that very much!
So overall I would say Ray Huffines will continue to recieve my business and I will refer them to anyone I know as a reliable and reputable place to go.

1023,"March 10, 2014","I needed service on my car and my old service agent Erin Lloyd apparently was no longer at this location so I assigned to Keith.  He was helpful and almost more informative and better at keeping up to date on my car than Erin Lloyd ever was.  He made sure the work got done a little quicker so my ride could bring me back to pick up my car during his break time.  He was very nice and made the situation painless.  Melva always seems to be my customer service checkout person and is always a delight.  She continuously apologizes for the wait even though you haven't been standing there for more than a minute.  She always has a smile on her face even though it looks like she has a lot going on that she is trying to keep straight.  She makes the checkout process quick and accurate.  Although I do feel that the service agents have lost their want to personable with you, I had to remind Keith when I showed up why I was there even though I made the appointment with him on the phone and he should have been expecting me.  I feel if I have to go through all the details on the phone when making the appointment I shouldn't have to do it again in person, it is exhausting to have to repeat yourself so many times.  I feel this is isn't just with Keith but I always had to do that over the years I worked with Erin.  I just don't feel like the really care about me or my car issues they just want you in and out.  Gone are the days when you could rely on the person you are dealing with to really care and go the extra mile to make you feel like you are the only one they are working with at that moment in time.  It's sad but I find this to be an issue at all dealerships no matter what brand or location.",4.2

I recently took my Chevy Equinox into the dealership for an annual state inspection.

When the work had been completed Melva Walton  immediately recognized me as a long time customer, favored me with one of her best smiles, and then worked pleasantly and efficiently to get me out the door and on my way home in no time at all.

1033,"March 01, 2014","Heads up Display (HUD) died on my Camaro about 6 months after I bought it from Huffines.  J.R. was my service advisor and got me taken care of including a courtesy vehicle (no cost), removal of a door ding and fixing the issue.  The job took about 2 1/2 days and required me to bring it back once (included in the timeframe) to fix a relay that was unplugged accidentally during the repair causing the heater not to work.

1036,"February 26, 2014","Melva Walton is always available, friendly and efficient.

Unfortunately for Service Quality of work, it was different:

  - Drop my car for oil service and to fix problem for message regarding ""Tire monitor"" display. Take the car back with notification to replace Trans line Cooler ( $ 483.95 to change a piece of pipe !!!). Part will be in order. On my way home, I saw that nothing was done for ""Tire monitor"" display, neither a new oil reminder sticker was put on windshield.
- Came-back the following week to fix the leak for the line cooler (received call for part being available). I I Mentioned the still existing issue with the ""tire display"" and the oil sticker. Work being long I got a free rent a car to go-back home late afternoon.
 - Came-back the following afternoon. Leak solved (!!), tire sensor was changed and oil sticker updated. Few minutes after leaving ""Tire monitor system"" alert showed up again.
- came back the following week: The reset of the system was not made...reason of the problem..

To have to deal 3 times for an issue so minor (but security first) as a tire sensor is a total waist of time for your customer ( as well as your service). I'm leaving in University Park and your dealership is quite far from my home. I still do business with you because so far I always received  good service from your advisers ( Keith, Frank..). This can be reconsider if other problem occurred. 

Cordially,

1039,"February 24, 2014","I brought the car into the Huffines at Plano. they had to find the reason i was getting a U0073 code and more that was an issue for 5 to 6 weeks. i was told that i needed a part first to be able to move on by Reggie because they were told the 25819157 module to find out what else was wrong.
i have bought 3 new cars from the Huffines group in Lewisville, an 05 Equinox, no break on price, 05 Cobalt for my daughter and i got a break in price and a 06 HHR i got a break in price. i also have a business in Texas since 1981 and get discounts at 3 Chevy Dealers in the metroplex that i have not bought cars from. Classic in Grapevine, another dealer that is now gone and Reliable Chevy. Reliable had my 08 HHR SS for 4 days and couldnt fix anything.
huffines offered me a 10%  discount on parts, that is all and i get 32 to 40% at the other dealers. well i bought the part and had it overnighted. well Huffines didnt need the part for which now i will lose 30% restock fee which is a $100 loss and i paid 585 in labor only and no parts to get the car running
granted they fixed it but i got no discount on the part, now i lose another 100 returning it and i have Stage 4 cancer for which i told them and i am on SSI disabled income and medical insurance. i had to quit teaching after 41 years so i got no break from Huffines from them after buying 3 brand new cars from them and i get discounts from dealers for which i never bought cars from.

will i ever go back and use them for service- NO
will i ever recommend them to someone else after this to buy a new car or for service- xxxx NO

my car is fixed but i am highly disappointed w the whole experience and especially since i am financially handicapped. if my fiancee didnt step in and help me i would have been screwed. 
Reliable got the part overnight, they did terrible on service but at least they offered
Huffines didnt even offer to buy the part from me and they just put on the floor and wish me luck.

this is the 3rd time i have been disappointed w Huffines and will never go back for anything, EVER

i thought i would at least get my car back w a car wash and vacuum after spending 585 in nothing but service fees and no parts but no the car was not vacuumed or washed. just very disappointing.",2.8

My 1st service adviser retired and I thought I would never be treated that well again.  I was wrong.  My next adviser, Jerry Taylor was familiar with my vehicles and seamlessly took over.  As Jerry moved to Body, Keith Overturf was also familiar with my growing stable, and always goes out his way to take care of my relationship with  Huffiness Chevrolet.  
When I retired after 36 years, my company practically gave my my company '08 Impala which Huffines had already serviced since zero-miles.  Melva has been a big asset and cleared every administrative problem I ever had and always recognizes me as a ""life-customer"".  Judy's reception and telephone help is invaluable and obviously knows the organization well and makes sure I am taken care of when Keith is unavailable.
Even the courtesy drivers Maynar and Ricky know me and always remember me.
I have been lucky enough the meet Mr. Huffines several times and he has always accepted my compliments on his organization graciously, but humbly.

1102,"January 13, 2014","Our Buick Regal was brought in with a ""Service Engine Soon"" light on the dash and for an Inspection. Frank called after about an hour or so and described the service to be performed (Thermostat). Frank offered a complete service for the coolant system resulting in a very small additional cost. He also told us that since the service would require erasing the computer history, we would need cold start the car a couple of times before an Inspection could be done. We took the car home later the same day ( Thursday) after repairs were completed and asked if we could bring the car back for inspection on Monday. When we brought the car in on Monday for the inspection, Frank got the car right in and we were out in 30 minutes.

My wife had taken the car back for inspection and I called Melva with the credit card. The whole transaction on the phone was quick, accurate and very easy. Good job to this fine dealership and especially to frank and Melva!

1126,"December 31, 2013","Note: My story/complaint relates to the collision center (and I believe, management), not the sales part of the dealership, and not necessarily the non-collision part of the service center, as I'm not sure if they share worker resources or not.

Based on my $21K job at the collision center, this dealership appears to NOT own up to their work, and worse is DISHONEST and flat out DISPICIPLE.

Here's my currently unfolding story:

In 2008, 5 years ago, I got in a bad front end accident in my corvette.
My insurance, Farmers, referred me to one of the trusted places in what they call their ""circle of dependability"", which among other benefits, offers a lifetime warranty to back the work performed.
At the time, I had some minor to medium issues after the repair, which I willn't get into, but what I will say is that I hated going back because of their attitude, which I had always assumed was due to the ""farmers assigned guy"", 

Richard Snyder.   
There were several things they just couldn't get right.
My interface, Richard, quite the politician, insisted that everything was ""with in factory specs"".

It's now 2013, 5 years, but only 4K miles, later.
I finally decided to do face the dreaded task of trying to go back to Huffines again to speak to Richard again in the collision center about a front and noise that has gradually been progressing over the years (and 4K miles).

True to form, he gave me a political run-a-round indicating that too much time had passed, and that the so-called lifetime warranty"" more referred to paint type work than mechanical, because mechanical parts wear.  I told him it was 

only 4K miles, and he said that's the problem - I wasn't driving it enough, causing things like bushings to dry out.
I all but begged him to have a body man/mechanic at least take a look at the car and noise, but he said that my only options were to either bring it to Service on my own and have them diagnosis it, or if I wanted something for free, 

claiming warranty, to contact Farmers, since I was talking about the circle of dependability warranty (and pointed out to me that Huffines was no longer on that program).

I then contacted Farmers, who assigned the best, most thorough claims adjuster imaginable - he was an X-GM mechanic, and even had lots of specific Corvette training from GM.
He sent me to the next closest Chevrolet dealer that IS still in the circle of dependability program - Reliable Chevrolet in Richardson.
There, the corvette expert and Farmers adjuster, very very carefully examined the front end and all the $21K+ of work Huffines did in 2008, and guess what?  It was NOT performed to factory specs after all.

According to what I was told, The left side rail (of the frame) wasn't welded according to spec, and the right side rail still has a small ripple/bend in it which is throwing things off slightly - but slightly on a corvette Z06 is 

important.   As I'm informed, because of the off frame, it seems that several mounts that are supposed to be bolted to the frame were welded on instead - because the bolts wouldn't align up.  There are other small things, but these big 

things, as I'm told, amount to $10K-$15K of work to be redone correctly and according to GM specs.
The biggest issues appears to be the not perfectly straight right side rail, because according to Farmers, there is a liability because a rail with even a slight bend, becomes a rail with a weak point, as the bent area is susceptible to 

failure should the vehicle again get in another bad accident.

Farmers informed me that before they can approve Reliable Chevrolet to begin repairs/rework under the ""COD warranty"", they first need to call Huffines in to review the findings and hopefully offer to take ownership of the shoddy work.

OK, before I go into what happened next, I want to point out that I was actually in agreement to allow Huffines to re-do their work, and do it right, with a 3rd party, such as Farmers or their assignee to inspect the final job this 

time.
Unfortunately, the original mechanic from 5 years back, and several Huffines managers visited Reliable the other day to look at my car, and denied taking responsibility.

Denying taking responsibility for their shoddy work is one thing, and probably more of a legal matter (which Farmers may well tear them apart in court over), but the thing that I consider absolutely despicable and dishonest is the 

reason they provided for not taking responsibility.

Ready for this? - They claim the car WAS IN ANOTHER ACCIDENT BECAUSE THEIR DEALERSHIP WOULD NEVER DO SHUCH SLOPPY, IMPROPER WORK !

Wholly cow - what nonsense! (and arrogance)
I like to think I try to be an understanding and patient guy, but to flat out denie the bad work is their work is flat out fraudulent, and suddenly I find myself extremely angry and wanting the world to know this story and what kind of place Huffines is (or at least has become).

I' not sure about the sales side of things, but if the general dealership management are the ones executing this fraudulent behavior, then I would say the proceed with extreme caution doing anything related to the Huffines company.",1.5

1133,"December 26, 2013",I have three Chevrolets and have them all serviced at Huffines. The Service Department is the best I nave ever dealt with. Reggie keeps you very informed as to what's going on with your vehicle. After having some tires mounted I noticed a scratch on the wheel that was not previously there. I showed it to Reggie and it was taken care of the next day. As with any maintenance needed I expect it to be completed properly but Huffines (Reggie) goes the extra step to make the experience go much more smoothly without the many problems I have experienced at other dealerships.The cashiers are always very friendly and helpful. I would recommend this Service Department above all.,4.8

1135,"December 23, 2013","Thank you for the opportunity to tell you about my experience with your people today.

The focus is going to be on MELVA WATSON...cashier...who checked me out at the Cashier's window this afternoon (12/23).

Dec. 23rd was a very busy day for your dealership, both sales and service.  I saw a guy out there in the Service drive-up with a brand new Corvette and could tell he had just bought it.  I asked, and an employee told me the Christmas vehicle sales were going really well.  And tons of people were leaving their vehicles while they travelled.  So the Service Dept. was buried.   I asked the Courtesy Driver, and he said that there had been 141 vehicles checked-in and left for service by the time I left my car!!  That was about noon time...

I had my tires rotated and an oil change done on my Tahoe (2012 / 13,000 miles).   Incidentally, I love my Tahoe.  I bought it at your dealership.  It is like riding around in my living room!   I have had two Corvettes and am going to buy another one in a year or two!  Right now, my second car is a 1985 Chevrolet IROC Z-28 with 7,000 miles on it!! 

Anyhow...this to say...your dealership was SUPER BUSY today...and there was every reason for your employees to give me the rush job...

But when I went to check out...MELVA WATSON....was in the Christmas spirit at the Cashier's window!!!  She greeted me with a big smile and looked so Christmas-y with her professional image and special Christmas dress code!   I immediately noticed her name tag because I planned to comment on her via an E-mail...  But, after Melva had rung me up, she asked if I would be willing to go on-line and fill out a customer survey?  Of course I immediately said ""Yes"" !!  

MELVA WATSON is everything you want as an employee of Huffines' at the Cashier's window.  So make sure that you don't lose her under any circumstances.  She was fast, she was accurate, she was friendly, she had her act together; she was tearing off invoice stubs and copies, and spinning them around, stapling receipts, printing Charge Card receipts and handing me a pen and showing me where to sign, BAM!!!!.... All that in about 10 seconds, and then saying ""Thank you for your business Mr. DePace"".   I couldn't believe it!!    Someone was actually taking pride in their job execution, speed, accuracy, considerate of the customer's time.  In short, Melva Watson was taking OWNERSHIP of her actions...SETTING THE EXAMPLE TO THE OTHER CASHIER'S who were watching and listening nearby!  She was THANKING ME for spending my money and choosing Huffines.... All that, and Melva was BEING FRIENDLY AND CHARMING and FUN too!!!  I mean, what else could a customer (or employer) ask for?!!   I know I couldn't!

No, MELVA WATSON is not my mom!!   I am just some guy who buys cars from you and has his cars serviced at your place!!!   But I know about Customer Service.  Because, although retired, I also depended on someone to represent my company with our customers.  And I wish I had a lot more MELVA WATSONs in my time!!!   

Melva is your customers' LAST IMPRESSION in the Service Dept.  Think about it.  Your CASHIER is the last impression your customers have when having their vehicle serviced.  Some of the bills a cashier has to ring up are up there, huge.  They hurt. Things can get emotional.  Or, there is some frustrating issue, and they come to that window already hot under the collar.  And how these customers are handled might mean the difference between them leaving in a reasonable spirit, coming back, buying again; or being further aggravated and saying ""Hey, I can have my car worked on and buy my cars at some other delaership.""  There are lots of choices out there...

So take a minute to tell MELVA WATSON that some guy she waited on wrote about her...and took the time to say she was terrific.  Because she was.  Melva Watson was a great hire...and is a super employee!!

Best regards, and Merry Christmas...

P.S.  Evan Pace was my Service Writer...and he told me you were very busy when I dropped off my Tahoe; but they would do their best to get my car done as-soon-as-possible... And he delivered, along with your service guys, as my car was ready in time for me to get a shuttle ride back up to the dealership for vehicle for pick-up.  Much appreciated.

1140,"December 20, 2013","After weeks of doing research and deciding on a new Chevy Sonic, I worked with a wonderful sales person at Ray Huffines, Blair McElreath, to gather information on the exact car I wanted.  With Blair expecting me, I drove to Plano, TX from Tulsa, OK on a Saturday with my pre-approved Capital One auto loan financing check in hand, only to be insulted by Shane Dove, who, after 3 hours waiting with my daughter in the showroom, came in to try and bully me by saying that if I did not provide my social security number to ""verify my identify"" then they could not sell me the vehicle, even though they already had my driver's license, my proof of insurance, and the original, pre-approved Capital One ""Blank Check"" auto loan information.  All I had to do was fill out the check and the sale was done.

I had already been asked 3 times for my social security number on a credit application before Shane walked in and 3 times I explained that I already had my financing and was not going to provide my social as there was no need.  After I refused, once again, to give my social to Shane, pointing out that they already had ""verified my identity"", he then informed me ""it was company policy"" and stated again that they could  not sell me the vehicle without my social. 

This was not a cash transaction and they had more than enough information to ""verify my identity"".  I would never recommend this dealership to anyone, especially to women, unless they change their sales tactics and practice of trying to intimidate customers.",1.0

The so-called ""customer service"" I received was the worst EVER. Beyond rude staff, no regard for the actual issue on my car- they just tried to find every other thing wrong  so they could rack up a bill and get money out of me. I refused to have my car serviced there, called GM and they directed me to Huffines. The issue with my car was an extended warranty bulletin, so the issue was covered by GM. Steve and Susie took such great care of me and communicated the timeline of what was being done and when my car would be ready to pick up. They took care of the bill through GM- the only thing I paid for was my state inspection. They gave me a list of things my car could benefit from, but didn't try to cram repairs down my throat- which was nice, because most places will try to convince you that you ""have to have this fixed or else…"" I thoroughly enjoyed my service experience from the time I dropped my car off, to the time I paid out with Shirley and chatted with her for a few minutes. Thank you, Huffines, for taking the bad taste of GM that Stonebriar left with me. Definitely have my business from here on out!

When I wasn't contacted later, I went back to the dealership.  I waited for over an hour while the original sales associate from the used car department continued to keep the sale moving forward and accommodate me.  While the new car sales department lolly-gagged and gossiped.  When I finally got tired of waiting after two hours, I went straight into the managers office and confronted him.  He continued to beat around the bush and tell me that he couldn't have the car delivered if the other lot wouldn't give it up, when he had made false promises all day.  His words were "" don't 
push me!"".  I was disrespected and offended by his demeanor.  Which developed into an altercation in his office.  This is the dumbest salesman I have ever met.  I reminded him previously that I was ready to cut a check for the full amount that day.  Luckily, I took my business elsewhere.  ",1.0

I should start by saying I have been a long time customer of Huffines , both purchasing vehicles and having them serviced there.   I came to Huffines when my service advisor, Keith Overturf, left Reliable Chevrolet and started with you.  I have always enjoyed great service and have been a loyal customer.  Below is a great example of why I will continue to be.
Last Friday afternoon I was driving on PGT and it was pouring rain.  It was raining so hard I had the wipers on full blast and that is when they overlapped, twisted themselves into a pretzel and stopped altogether.   Normally, I would not have been this close to Huffines, as I live about fifty miles away, but that day lucky for me I was in the neighborhood.  
I pulled in, got Keith, we went to parts, got the new blades, Cynthia rang me up, Keith installed them tightened the control arms and done.  
I then told Keith I had a check engine light that was going on and off but happened to be on.  He checked it, found a broken wire leading to a sensor, fixed and I was on my way in about a half an hour.

Lopez has, on occasions, answered several of my more ""technical"" questions.  I am a retired Texas Professional Engineer and tend to ask more questions than the more normal customer.  Steve Gandy recently helped resolve an old ""Vehicle Recall"" question I had which provided some piece of mind.  And, as usual, upon checkout, Melva Walton is there with a smile to take whatever funding I have left in my pocket.  Such a nice person to end each visit with.  Also --I will not overlook the maintenance / servicing staff in the shop who are so willing to answer technical questions as they arise.  For those ""pesky"" loose parts that are sometimes needed, John in the Parts Dept. is always willing to help find them (wherever he must go to find them).  That is so helpful for us with older vehicles.  
   Thank you all.   Everyone I meet at Huffines Cheverolet is very kind and helpful.

The Technical Service Writers have a vast knowledge of the Chevrolet products, I know that when I visit Huffines Frank Conti will tell it like it is, the only padding is in the waiting room chairs.  Sometimes the reality of a vehicles condition and associated repair costs can be overwhelming, Frank and the Huffines Team do what they can to work with the Customer in each case.

The Cashiers have always been a pleasure to work with, especially Melva Walton, the Ladies ALL have Great! personal skills in dealing with the diverse public element that they encounter on a daily basis.

My husband called me on my drive in on Tuesday and said there was oil on the garage floor and that I needed to get my Tahoe to a dealer immediately.  We had purchased our first Tahoe at Huffines in 2005 and they were the first place I thought of.  

I took it in on Wednesday morning and was greeted promptly by Susie Frazier.  I told her my problem and also a couple of other issues that I wanted to get checked out while it was still under warranty.  I used their courtesy shuttle also.  Ms. Frazier called me in just a few hours to let me know their findings.  She set it up for the courtesy shuttle to pick me up at work and take me to get my vehicle.

During my last service , I had the pleasure of being checked out by Melva Walton.  I found Melva to be extremely friendly, efficient in the checkout process as well as conveying considerable awareness and knowledge of the process.  It was a true pleasure to go thru the checkout process with her.

1261,"September 30, 2013","I have driven a ton of cars in the past 5 years, so when I walked into Ray Huffines I knew exactly what I wanted to look closely at: the Chevy Cruze. I wasn't about to listen to sales pitches or any such fluff business. I was a woman on a mission and I was waiting to be impressed after visiting 6 other dealers and dealing with their pitches. Enter Bryce: I was immediately impressed by his chill demeanor and how he listened to exactly why I was there. And surprise - no sales pitch! He immediately pulled up a car and we were test driving it within minutes. He answered my questions easily and happily no matter what I asked. 
Enter Darren: again, completely impressed. Darren was as relaxed was and we spent a good 15 minutes talking cars before we even sat down to talk price. They both were so helpful on selecting a trim model, something I don't care too much about until it's too late, and Darren made sure I got the color I wanted. Neither of them pressured me into a commitment ASAP, made sure I was comfortable in knowing all the options of purchasing, and actually made the buying process fun! We bonded during the time most customers find the most harrowing. Darren especially impressed me by talking about the other cars I had been looking at, discussing their good points and bad. Their professionalism, care and concern over my future car was so refreshing. And the price wasn't half bad either.

When my car finally arrived (it was a dealership transfer) about a week later there were a few minor knicks in the plastic. Bryce and Darren immediately catalogued everything, didn't make me feel bad for noticing them, and made sure I was kept abreast of the repairs, which happened ASAP. Talk about fantastic customer service! A few days later I picked up my beautiful car, which Bryce had personally detailed himself because he knew I'm almost OCD about that, and I couldn't say thank you enough. The level of customer care and attention I detail from Huffines is astounding. Darren even went an extra mile when I had questions about my leather after the purchase and came out to my house before I started a crazy work week to make sure everything was to my standards. I felt like a celebrity (I am totally not)!!! These guys made purchasing my car the best experience of my life, and anyone who need new cars are now going to Huffines to work with Darren and Bryce. I really can't recommend them enough because of their stellar customer service. 

The only complaint I have is with Jeff, the F&I guy, who couldn't have spent less time with me or provided less information if I had dared him. He made me super uneasy and never returned a phone call with my questions. The only time I heard from him was when he called me and proceeded to yell at me about how I shouldn't pay full cash (which I was intending to do so I wouldn't have to deal with him), my credit is ""the worst he's seen"" and I need to finance to boost it. These are lies. My credit is fine. I gave him a tersely worded thank you and hung up on him - and paid cash for the car because there was no way I was dealing with him.",5.0

Keith, always upbeat and positive, delivers service in an excellent manner, getting straight to the point, identifying the problem and all possible solutions. He keeps the promise of delivery and timelines. May be most importantly, he keeps me updated on progress. I really appreciate that about him. No one enjoys unexpected vehicle problems but when faced with it, customers like me, want straight to the point service tech's that keep me informed and deliver on time. And this has always been my experience with Mr. Keith. Ms. Melva, by far, has to be the best in the business at making me feel satisfied when spending money. She is incredibly detailed and consistent when processing my service orders. Never a mistake and never any question of: 1. what was performed, 2. the cost & labor and 3. taking the time to inquire if I have any questions or concerns that she could assist in answering. This lady always has the time to communicate satisfaction to customers. I truly look forward to closing up service with my visit with Ms. Melva. She actually cares about the customer she is servicing, rather than just performing a routine job; and that is a rare trait in todays service industry.

When it is time for me to replace my vehicle, we only go to Huffines in Plano. I would never purchase a vehicle at any other dealership.   This is due  not only to the friendliness of the sales team but also mostly due to the customer service we receive in the Service Department time and time again!  While the sales department is very important, you generally continue to see your Service Dealer several times a year....in my case for oil changes and state inspections.  He keeps my Tahoe running smoothly!  There have been a few service issues over the years with my cars, but Frank gets right to it, explains the problem to me so I can usually understand, and if I do not understand, he is willing to stop right there and call my husband and explain it to him!   Frank has been my service adviser for as long as I can remember.  I bet he is the only Service Adviser who greats his loyal customers with a big, warm, welcoming hug!  By now we know about each other's families and exchange a quick update on everyone and the latest with our kiddos and my grandchildren!  There have been a couple of occasions over the past years when Frank is not there when I bring my car in, and Reggie helps me the minute he sees me pull up.

1287,"July 21, 2013","I gave Ray Huffines Chevrolet a call Tuesday July 16th, 2013 in the later afternoon to let them know I was heading on in. 
We got there and informed Mark Ackerman that we wanted to test drive the Camaro. He stuck my 240lb husband in the little bitty backseat refusing to get in the backseat because he (the sales rep) was scared. Well, when you take a test drive in a Camaro you're wanting to experience power, correct? Mark said I had to follow a specific route that limited me to 40mph zones. Really? So much for trying to test out the power in the car. We returned back to the lot Mark informed us that if we wanted to stay with a good car to vear away from Chevy as Nissan, Toyota and Honda are better. Quite odd a sales person doesn't stick by the product he sells. Mark introduced us to his manager Darren Davis before we headed out the door. Darren Davis sat in the backseat of a 20-30 minute test drive in a 2014 Chevy Impala and up talked himself how he once worked at Boardwalk. We returned back to the lot at 10pm and he said for us to leave our car at the lot and to take the Chevy home to break it in as he was more than assured we would get the car. He did not have a business card for us to take with us nor the new fax number to Ray Huffines for me to fax in the paperwork, but he said no worries that he would text it to me first thing Wednesday morning. wednesday morning no text, i had to call and get it from the receptionist. I had Capital One fax to Darren at 930am our financial paperwork which I confirmed with Ray Huffines front desk receptionist that it came across and that she put in on his desk as requested by Darren. My husband called and left a message for Darren that evening to give us a call back as he never did. Thursday my husband left a voicemail for Darren the MANAGER and he never called back, so my husband left another message, but written with the receptionist to pass to Darren and never received a phone call back. Later Thursday I received a phone call from a third party company that Ray Huffines pays to retrieve reviews about customer service. It wasn't too pleasant. Mind you, I'm still rolling around in their brand new 2014 car. Friday comes around and my husband nor I received a phone call from Ray Huffines. I received another phone call from the 3rd party service paid by the owner of Ray Huffines for another review. So I ""big time"" complained about the lack of communication. Friday night after complaining, I received a phone call from Mark, ghasping ""Oh, i bet you thought we forgot about you....."" My thoughts...well, you did. He stated we were not approved for the car to go ahead and return it. The car was at $37,200. We got their Saturday at 11:30am, They tried putting us in a lower model impala, chrome trim to aluminum trim that was damaged on a brand new car with 175 miles on it with scratches on the inside plastic. Cheap horrible LT2 car for 3k less missing a lot of function and look of the LTZ. I told Darren it was damaged and he shrugged his shoulders and said hmm...that's interesting as if he didn't care. Then I told Darren that I was returning the Impala and not going into the lower model and he shrugged his shoulders. Then I said, i think we are going to Dodge and walked out the door as he SAID NOTHING but shrug his shoulders as he didn't care.  Dodge in Mckinney was fabulous. Great customer service and they got the loan approval to buy a Challenger SRT-8. Look up the price on that! Chevrolet didn't care enough to try and get us in the 2014 37k sedan, but dodge got us into an 6.1 Hemi SRT-8 loaded.

We were really still in the investigative stage at various dealerships and comparing prices, along with makes and models. My husband had gone into Huffines during a break one morning and talked to Jay Stauffacher about the pricing on the Silverado trucks. The pleasantness and willingness to work with him was great, especially since my husband wanted to wait until I had gotten off work so we could look at the truck together. When we both returned late that afternoon, we took our old truck to be appraised for a trade-in. There was no price haggling, going back and forth,or sitting around to get the deal complete. Because of the incentives offered, and the total amount they were willing to give for our trade-in, we set the paperwork in motion. We actually left the dealership for a while, and then we returned an hour later with all of the paperwork ready to go. Everything was reviewed with us in a timely manner, with no surprises before we went to financing. There, Jay Taylor took over and promised he would have us out in 25 minutes, unless we needed more time. He, too, was very thorough in the explanations and processes. We were driving off the lot by 7:30 pm. There was never any pressure or the feeling of ""you must buy today, or the offer will be gone"". I have never been so relaxed and felt at ease buying a new vehicle. This was an awesome experience! I would recommend Ray Huffines, and Jay Stauffacher to anyone.  Thank you Ray Huffines...Jon and Mica Melby",5.0
1302,"April 11, 2012","Lonnie Lynch helped me qualify for my dream car, the 2012 Camaro Convertible. He treated me the way I wanted to be treated with respect and kindness. He also pointed out the important things to know and went over all the devices in and out of the car. I loved the remote engine start, Onstar directions is so great! He made sure all the other people who worked with me were nice too and helpful. JR, in the service department, checked to see if the recall items for my car were in when I had the Xzylon on my car's interior and exterior which I highly recommend. He knew I was in the waiting room so he finished in two hours instead of three. Jay taylor helped me select the coverage for my care care package and made it perfect. Rich Harrison calmed me down when I was afraid I couldn't afford my car and I called him early one morning panicked. He said it would work out and he would call me back. Luckily I got info to  make me feel secure so I called the dealership and Rich answered again. I blurted out that I was keeping the car. He said he was so happy to hear that and it was Rich! Thanks Huffhines! Kathie Brechbuhler",5.0
1303,"February 01, 2012","I have used Ray Huffines Cheverolet for over 20 years.  Roy Thompson is an outstanding service manager and goes out of his way to help.  The service department at Huffines is the only one that I will allow to work on my current Avalanche and Buick and have been the sole service department for all my previous cars and trucks.
There work is outstanding and reliable.  I could probably found a truck elsewhere for less but the service department at Ray Huffines Cheverolet and people like Roy Thompson are what bring me back to Huffines.
Well done Roy on the recent work and all before, OUTSTANDING!!!!!",5.0
1304,"January 24, 2012","My family and I have used Ray Huffines for more than 10 years.  Roy Thompson, our Service Advisor has been exceptional in every aspect of his job.  He is helpful, friendly, knowledgable and honest with me about the maintenance needs of my vehicles.  He has never advocated any service that was not needed but has been on top of anything which was necessary.  Since first coming to the dealership for service in 2000, we have bought two more vehicles from Huffines, mainly because of Roy.

I believe the entire Huffines staff are far above the average in their knowledge of their products and respect of their customers' needs.  I will continue to patronize them and suggest friends and family to do the same.

When we bought our 2011 Camaro, we were treated with the utmost courtesy by Suzie Frazier.  She was also representative of the knowledge and capability of the Huffines group. Suzie was quick to follow up on our satisfaction with the vehicle and offered any assistance needed to make our purchase a real winner.

In addition, she was extremely helpful in solving a small problem we had with SiriusXM that I was unable to handle myself.",5.0

1306,"November 10, 2011","Went there for oil change because it was free. Remodeling ongoing and service adviser did not tell me where to go wait, so I stood like an idiot until I decided to ASK where the waiting room was. Crabby employee as a cashier, bad-mouthing everyone. I Was told I needed an air filter but decided to replace it myself. Bought the air filter and I realized I had replaced it 12k miles before. Sure enough, the air filter was fine and did not need to be replaced. The air pressure on tires NOT checked as stated, since the next day I noticed they were low and had a 20-25 PSI on 3 tires (on an SUV where cold PSI is recommended at 30-32) Needless to say, wont be going back. If this is how GM treats customers, I expect them to go bankrupt again.

1307,"November 04, 2011","We did business with salesman Lonnie this fall when my husband bought his 2011 Camaro SS, (his Mistress) and we were treated very well.  I decided I was going to look into new Chevrolet Equonix, a 2012. I call and Lonnie had already left for the day but I did talk to another gentleman and I sadly did not get his name, but he informed me he would let Lonnie know.  After thinking more and more about this I ventured to their Friendly Website and for the first time ever did a live chat. I spoke with a gentleman by the name of Dwight and he gave me more info on the car and then when I told him I knew that they had a Black and White and I really had hoped to find a different color he informed me they had just gotten another shipment and he was not sure what colors were their but he TOOK the time to go in the back and get the colors for me.  I was interested in red, blue or Mocha. He had the mocha and blue and when I saw the picture of the Mocha Equinox I knew I had to set up test drive and soon.  He said he would refer all this to Lonnie who called me when he got into work yesterday. He even Took Time out from possible missing other sales to bring the car to me to see and test drive!!  Never have I dealt with such a great group to go above and beyond their actual jobs.  So to end this story, Today I am happy to say we met with AJ Chandna bright and early this morning (so my husband could be at work on time) and I drove off the lot with my new MOCHA STEEL METALLIC 2012E EQUIDOX. This was actually the first vehicle I have ever bought new and these guys were all just so helpful. This company is like family now!",5.0
1308,"October 04, 2011","This is simply the mark of GM's terrible customer service. I own a Saturn and they CLAIM to want to keep me as a customer, but this experience shows otherwise. My Saturn has had a passlock system problem for about 2 years that is a known issue on ALL GM cars. After about 7 years, these systems start to fail. They won't recall them because it isn't a ""safety issue."" So I go into Huffines because the system is acting up, my key is locked in the ignition and my car won't start. Because the passlock light was on (indicating the problem) my battery went dead. I've been here before for oil changes and always had a great experience. I got Reginald (Reggie) who was rude to me from the beginning. I know I'm a female, but that does not mean I don't know my own vehicle. He quoted me a new ignition cylinder and battery. Battery was 165$ (should be about 70$ without labor), but I was willing pay extra to get the whole thing fixed for $440. He then called back and said (surprise, surprise) that it was the passlock system and the total was now $585 (left a voicemail). My decision was to get the ignition cylinder and the passlock fixed, but to check to see if my battery was under warranty; which means 165$ off of the total quote of $585. The work is finished, and Reggie 1. Says it won't start without a battery, meaning that I can't verify their work. (but then his associate ""magically"" got it to start) and 2. Says that he quoted me $585 for just the two parts, not including the battery. So I make him listen to his voicemail. He then proceeds to invade my space, act like I don't know my car, and that I misunderstood him. I asked him why he would ever give a partial quote. He just said that's how much it is. I refused to pay that, and we settled on $485. I take the car to WalMart and my battery is actually under warranty (no charge to fix). In addition, my key CONTINUES to get stuck in the ignition, even though Reggie assured me that it was fixed. I bought the part to fix this and did it myself. I also replaced the ignition switch because it was bad. So out of this experience. 1. I was treated horribly 2. My car was not fixed 3. I was lied to and 4. I was squeezed for money. Why would anyone return after that? I also tweeted my problem to @GMCustomerSvc and got a small response asking me if I would ever take it to another dealer again. I said yes, if they had a recommendation of an honest one. Note to self: BUY SOMEWHERE ELSE!",1.0
1309,"August 05, 2011","this dealership has broke something everytime I have gone in for service... costing me Thousands... Beware Corvette Owners run away from Huffines Plano on Coit.
I asked to speak to Terry's manager but he was out of the office, I than requested to speak to the managers boss and Terry refused.. I told him I would also get in touch with Mr. Huffines and Terry's response was ""So What"" he obviously could care less.",1.4
1310,"June 22, 2011","I have driven surburban's since 1986 and purchased 9 of them , My 2004 LT surburban with 112k miles on it which was still new like shape , but i had the new surburban  fever and i contacted Huffines Chev thru the internet and Mark Ackerman replied within 30 min, we discussed what i had and what i wanted , After a few months of talks and with me being out of town alot on business my wife and i made an appointment with Mr. Ackerman he had the surburban pulled out on the patio and was shinning ( it was Mrs Huffines Demo). it had everything we wanted and was exactly what Mr. Ackerman said it was . Was glad to deal with a honest and truthful sales person for once. The finiance personal was straight forward and profesional as well sorry i dont remember his name. We purchased the GMAC gold service contract and paint protector and sheduled to bring it back in to service for that. My wife brought the surburban in and AJ Lopez in the service dept took great care of her, the service was going to take a little longer to complete than my wife had to wait for so Steve Gandy the service manager put her in a car (which was a suv )as well , Upon the surbruban being completed Huffines contacted my wife and she picked up the surburban and was treated friendly and profesional. It is refreshing to find a dealership that handles the customer in the mannor that the staff at Huffines has shown.GM needs to cloan Huffines to show other dealerships how it is suppose to be. Cause i have dealt with the others and felt like they were doing my wife and i a favor to talk to us. So i have told any and all who asked about our LTZ Surburban who and where were  we purchased it,and the staff awesome profesional ways at Huffines.",5.0
1311,"June 22, 2011","Charles was a real pleasure to work with!! He is NOT your traditional ""car salesman"". He was VERY professional and through, especialy during the the car delivery process. I have purchased many cars and I would rate him the #1 car salesman. The younger salesmen need to take a few lessons from Charles......

He is the BEST!!!!!

1312,"June 22, 2011",First I know Ray Huffines personally and have great respect for him and his family. I let the sales people and finacing people know up front I was going to buy my Tahoe from them but still wanted the best pricing and service they had to offer. That is what i got at every point in the process. Outstanding job!,5.0
1313,"February 15, 2011","My sales person, Jay Stauffacher, was a pleasure to deal with. Not sure if I can say that about anybody I've ever dealt with when purchasing a new car. He is very polite and non pressuring. Easy to communicate with and works hard at getting you a good deal you are comfortable with. AJ was the finance person who also made the buying experience enjoyable and gave good insight. When the time comes to buy another car hopefully Jay and AJ will still be working there.",5.0
1314,"February 14, 2011",I was there with my son as he was haveing his truck looked at by the service dept. while we were waiting we went out to look at the used cars on the lot and I had found a car I was interested in. After I had talked to Walter about this car and from there it was a no pressure experiance buying a used car. I was very impressed with Walter and Robert his boss. I would recommend Walter to anyone looking for a quality used car to buy. ,5.0
1315,"February 07, 2011","Chris Carlson made this by far the best experience I've ever had.  He was exceptional.  He didn't pressure me into the sale, but instead helped me to make an educated decision.  The car we chose was exactly what we were looking for.  The price was great and so was my trade value.  It really couldn't have been better, unless the car was free!  I would recommend everyone go to Huffines and buy your next  pre-owned vehicle from Chris.  You won't be disappointed!  ",5.0
