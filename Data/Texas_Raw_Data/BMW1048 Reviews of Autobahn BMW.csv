83,"December 18, 2019","I leased a 2020 M4 convertible and worked with David Lassiter.  The M4 has been a 'dream' of mine for some time and for me, the pinnacle of BMW vehicles.  I started the process in May 2019 and took delivery on 12.14.19 after placing the order in September 2019.  David was very helpful and most importantly to me, very patient and understanding with all of my questions about the car.  Getting the M4 was a milestone for me, so regardless of whether it was a purchase or lease, it was a significant decision and lease/purchase for me.  David was great in answering my questions / concerns and helping me to 'get over the finish line' (even if I had already made the 'yes' decision in my mind); he helped me balance the decision out.  Brandon Lee also assisted.  I've worked with Brandon in the past and I greatly appreciate his efforts; he makes you feel like you're the most important person in the room regardless of what you're getting and speaks to you like a person and not just a sales quota (the same goes for David).  This is my 4th BMW with Autobahn and I will keep coming back because of David and Brandon.  Both of them is what sets Autobahn apart from other dealers.  I hope management values their service.  Jody in Finance was also great to work with; she had everything ready to go and the financing process was effortless.  ",5.0

I was not given tha option to speak to anyone there, to include the service representatives nor was I even offered a phone to call from. I WAS THERE and was treated in a way that I have never been treated before at Autobahn. She never even asked for my name.

Luxury car dealerships are held to a higher standard than ""regular"" car dealerships and I will hold Autobahn to those standards every time that I visit there for service. This  is the first discordant note that I have during a visit and hope to never encounter this level of service again.

However it’s hard to understand you put a perfectly good car in the shop and the door locks  are not functioning 100% anymore  ?
 However ,  I have pull believe the service advisor will take care of the situation I just don’t like to come to times .
 It’s possible it was a coincidence but each internal that’s not the remotes .
 It was about 50 some degrees in the garage this morning the door locks did not work properly to get in the car And  similar odd problems after 23 stops is the weather got better .
 So I drove back up to service today we changed out of battery and one of the remotes but there still some sort of issue and explain what it probably is...
 Every time you lock or unlock the door it always goes through the left front door so it appears it’s over worked  ?
 It affects the rest of the door locks even a gas cap  Lock ?
 I did not look like the remote have been damaged and secondary did not seem to have any impact  .
 Actually had to try to three times this morning to get in the car  ...  as I was used in keyless entry the same way that appeared things were better is the weather warmed up today  .
 I don’t think anyone would’ve known there was a problem when the vehicle was delivered  ?
 It appears to be software related but Charlie said that it’s probably not it’s on left front door  .
 So that’ll be three trips over an annual all change. 
 I’m not complaining I’m just planning it out the work needs to be checked when he goes out and sometimes they are certain items that will not show up in this is probably one of them  .
 It certainly does not help my believe and BMW and affected my ability to move forward probably have something today as I got up this morning and went to the bank put everything in place but not with the door locked functioning problem on almost a new car  .
 The door locks have not been overworked because the car wasn’t driven for over 10 months but 600 and something miles  .  It appears it is very well-made that was my assumption before I start driving it put miles on it now will see what happens  .
 I planned to put the 2018 X 4 up for sale .  And issue will just not go away and it doesn’t seem to be any accountability to the person that did not do their job which was a sales person .
 This is hard for me to understand it’s called “ honor “ and  cost me probably a one time event for me to own a Porsche  for a good price and see if I like them ...
 Right now I just don’t have an opinion anyway it’s like that door locks happened and it goes to your guy to tell you not to do anything .
 Girls back if the sales person it just went back as they said they did not do it and find out what was going on this would not be typed as  I have great faith and management and Autobaun .
However the owner has not apologized to me for the problem and cost me a lot of money",4.0

Then, after owning it for about 2 months, I took my car in for routine service. When I picked it up, they'd scratched the car. The service manager (David Powell) tried to make excuses and mentioned, ""well it looks like the bumper has already been re-painted..."". This made me LIVID as I'd bought the car from the dealership 2 months earlier and expressly asked what work had been done on the car before I bought it (and got it in writing), and this was NOT included. They told me it had only had routine service maintenance. When I called the general manager (Aaron Windes) about this issue, he also made excuses and never apologized. The dealership eventually agreed to fix the scratches. I took my car in and left it. They have now had my car for over a week and are being very sketchy about when it will be done. I have a suspicion that they have wrecked my car and are trying to fix it without me knowing. This dealership is dishonest. Also, when I went in to drop off my car to have the scratches fixed I overheard the service manager (David Powell) being very rude to another customer and refusing to give him anything in writing stating what service the dealership had performed on the man's car. The poor man was so exasperated he was even asking if he could just record David saying that the work was done so he had some kind of record. David flat out refused for no good reason.",1.0

Interesting enough I keep hearing that if you want a good experience from BMW to go to Sewell and not here. I asked weeks ago for the person in charge to call me before I decided to go elsewhere and of course they never cared to call.

For some reason, BMW does not allow the button to be programmed in the off position. Bummer!  This is not convenient for me, but guess I'll have to live with it. Would recommend that BMW look into this since it isn't a safety feature.  It should be left up to the driver to determine the driving position just like having the radio, navigation system, or air conditioning system under the driver's control. If the lane departure warning feature can be turned off by the driver, which is a safety feature, then certainly the auto start-stop feature should be under driver control.

He was very helpful and made arrangements for us to come in and look at it.  When we got there, Brian was busy(we were early), but he made sure we were taken care of.  The car was brought around and a gentleman showed us the attributes of the car and let us test drive.  I fell in love.  We decided we wanted to buy it.  Brian had us sit in the waiting area, which was comfortable and had snacks and drinks.  One of the reasons I decided on this vehicle was the included maintenance, car washes, and loan cars that the dealership provides.  That unto itself if a definite plus.  The staff is friendly and helpful.  The part guy Chris was also fantastic and treated us well when we bought new floor mats for our vehicle.  
I had a hitch put on my vehicle and when I got it back, it was perfectly detailed and the tank was full.  I was truly impressed and pleased.  Brian took extra time with me to show me the features on my car and mad sure all settings were set to my liking.  
I will definitely recommend anyone interested in buying a quality vehicle to come to Autobahn.

1037,"December 09, 2013","Horrific experience!
December 3, 2013, I contacted Autobahn about 2010 Lexus RX 350 listed on Autobahn website. Unfortunately, it was an internet sales manager, Charles Graham, who was working on this listing. I have never in my car buying experience met a more arrogant, dishonest, evasive and unprofessional sales person.  Complete lack of communication. Total misrepresentation of the car's true condition. 

During our original conversation with Charles, I clearly asked him about any additional damages to the car and he confirmed there none. Thanks to our inspector we found out the car had hail damage on the roof, poorly repaired damage on a rear and front bumpers with visible problems. Leaking rear shock. These are the things that should've been but were not disclosed to us. Charles acted as if he had no knowledge of any of this. Makes your car buying experience even worse when some unethical, arrogant and rude sales guy dismisses your concerns by saying "" go find a perfect car"" and walked off.

I sent an email to several Autobahn management and received zero response. After which I called and got a brush off response from another brilliant ""Customer Service Specialist"" 

Then I received a call from a sales manger, Kris, who in a nut shell said we are not perfect and are very surprised at Charles conduct. This is NOT about being perfect, this is about some degree of sales ethics and honesty!  

I'm sure they were able to sell the car to some uninformed people. But I will sleep better if I post this here and everywhere else. The car's VIN #: JTJZK1BA0A2404173, Stock #: B15194A. Hopefully this information gets to new owners some day.

During this time I also looked at a 2011 service loaner on the showroom floor that had most of the options I had looked at but at a much lower price then the 2013 model.  After sleeping on it I contacted Chad and said I was interested in the 2011 and went back in to discuss the sale.  Throughout all of this Chad was very polite and never got irritated that I had changed my mind at least three times.  He is what dealerships like to promote that they have but very few actually have  a sales staff or individual that measures up. To complete the sale he recommended several items that would enhance the vehicle to me and had the service department complete the items I said would need before taking delivery.  All of this was done as promised and even completed about 3 hours before the promised delivery time. 

I saw nothing in the dealership or sales staff that was not professional or what I would consider below the highest of standards.  I would recommend both. ",5.0
1041,"June 02, 2012","Charles Grahm was rude to my friend, Calls me, gets mad then Hangs Up on me. I told them I don't want to deal with him any more and today I get a letter from him thanking me for &quot;choosing&quot; him???? Had a &quot;pleasure&quot; experience??? &quot;Call me directly&quot; for any assistance??? That just makes me even more dissatisfied when I tell them I will come back to buy it if I don't deal with him any more.
He made the normal 4 hour drive round trip into 8 hours....in the same day.....",1.8
1042,"August 18, 2011","I was looking for price quote for a 2011 BMW 528i. Since their intenet sales manager, Chad, emailed me a few times and seemed nice, I called him today to discuss a car in their inventory. But he is so rude that I can't even talk with him. He refused to quote me price on the car other than MSRP. He told me that if I want to buy that car, I have one chance to offer him a price that he likes. He is too busy to discuss it with me. If he likes my price, I can buy it, otherwise, no. There is only one chance. 
As result of that call, I bought a 2011 BMW 528i from Moritz this afternoon. 

Chad is the rudest salesman I have ever seen.

1043,"June 02, 2011","I strongly recommend - DO NOT do business with Autobahn Motorcars in Fort Worth. Through the internet, I bought a car from Autobahn Motorcar Group. I was told by the sales person, Mike Greenfeder, that the car had been inspected and was in beautiful condition and did not need any repairs. When the car was delivered to me, the first thing I noticed was that the emergency brake lever was loose, and when I pulled it, it came all the way up and hit the arm rest, it also did not stop the car from rolling ($65 fix), after about 2 days the battery died ($215). I jump started the car and took it to my mechanic to replace the battery. I asked him to do an inspection as well. My mechanic found that several parts needed to be replaced. These included: Front brakes and rotors (were worn to about 99%, $820), High-pressure power steering hose was leaking ($475), Muffler hanger was broken and muffler was dangling on one side ($65), Transmission fluid was bad ($125), the alignment was checked and it was determined to be out of alignment ($130), I had even specifically asked about the alignment before I bought the car and was told that it did not need an alignment. Also, the headliner fabric is un-glued and is bunching up near where the headliner meets the dash (not fixed). On top of all this, the car's A/C system has a strong urine smell (have not been able to fix this, have done the Frigi-Fresh treatment 3 times, still smelling). I have receipts for all of the fixes mentioned above. I contacted Autobahn Motorcar Group and Mike, the salesperson, blamed everything on either human error on his mechanic's part, or he said my mechanic must be ""too picky"". I have known my mechanic for 7 years and trust him completely (he also has excellent reviews online). I believe this car had a lot of problems and that because I was an out of state buyer, they took advantage of me. Also, one more thing I forgot to mention. The car was supposedly detailed before shipped to me...maybe they detailed part of the car, but I found it COVERED in white dog hair and I found vomit under the seat when I detailed it myself. I have made an official complaint with the BBB (Better Business Bureau) I strongly recommend - DO NOT do business with Autobahn Motorcars in Fort Worth.",1.0
1044,"September 11, 2009","I was overcharged for an oil changes.  They charged me more oil then my car can hold.  Called them a few times but no call back.  Contacted BMW North America to intervene and they only agreed for less than partial refund. Spoke to them about my total difference refund and the manager hung up on me rudely. I was never rude, never cuss or yell at them.  Also, prior they refused to honor a BMW national recall fix and forcefully wanted me to pay.  Got BMW NA involved as well and after 5 days, my car was finally fixed.  Horrible customer service from the management team.  I would never go back to them even though they are closest to where I live.",1.8
1045,"March 23, 2004","After beign a loyal John Roberts customer for years, I switched to Autobahn 3 BMWs ago. Each experience has been great, especially when compared to other BMW dealers in the metroplex. The 45-mile drive is worth it for me.Each time, I have been able to complete the transaction over the phone and fax. When I go to pick up my new car, I am in and out in 30 minutes.The last one I bought, in October 2003, I had the pleasure of dealing with Terrence (my previous guy, Todd, had moved on, but he was also great to deal with). These guys are pleasant, easy to work with, and have consistently offered the most fair price in the Mteroplex. I appreciate the way they respect my time and do not play games. Their finance guy is good too-very down to business.I do wish they would return calls more promptly, but other than that I feel they have provided me with a first class experience",4.8
1046,"October 31, 2003","Bought my car from Chad at Autobahn. Very good experience. I had previously bought a car at John Roberts in Dallas and was very turned off by them. They wouldn't budge on price. Chad was willing to work with me and I left with a deal I was happy with. Whole sales experience was great and I was treated like royalty. After I had my car, got the HK rattle and brought it in for service. It took them a couple days to fix it because they ran out of the parts but that was okay because I had a loaner. The only problem was the damaged my tint on my rear window. So, they had it redone and drove my car out to me 50 miles away to not inconvenience me. So, they were willing to go the extra mile. All in all, I LOVE that dealership and will buy all my BMW's from them. They were friendly, are willing to work with you, and don't ignore you after they have your money like other dealerships.",4.8
1047,"March 25, 2003","When dealing directly with the Service Manager, my concerns were partially addressed.  As for the Service Reps themselves, don't bother wasting your breath.  The mechanic's skill levels may rival a Kia dealership, but a higher standard should be met when toting a BMW logo.  Surely there is a better place to go within the DFW area.",1.8
