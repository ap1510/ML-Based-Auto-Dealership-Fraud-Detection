1,"May 11, 2020",The pickup and delivery service initiated by my service rep.(Shane Donaldson) was crucial during this pandemic. Everyone was courteous and professional. All issues were addressed and corrected including car wash. Thank you Shane for making this happen.,5.0
2,"May 10, 2020",We drove an extra 45 minute to have Bayway Lincoln do our routine service on our Navigator.    We live on the northwest side of Houston in Magnolia and much closer to another Lincoln dealer. After the other dealer did the service last time we decided to drive the extra distance and have much better customer service and things done correctly. ,5.0

4,"August 12, 2019","Terrible over all experience. I ended up paying 7k more for the navigator than I agreed to. At 2k miles the engine was burning oil and only had 3 quarts by the time the check engine light came on. Then, bo loaner car was available . Now I'm having to use masking tape to keep my rear air vents open. ",1.0
5,"March 28, 2019",We purchased a certified licolon from Bayway. We have had major problems since wk 1. We paid an extra 6k for the best warranty the offered. The warranty covers bumper to bumper to 100k miles. Wr are having motor problems and they aren’t willing to do anything. We reminded them we started complaining the first week. I don’t drive very much and this company is horrible. I am seeking an attorney to handle this,1.0

8,"July 02, 2018","I just bought a 2018 Lincoln MKC from here!  We did everything via text message and two phone calls.  I was in and out of the dealership in 2 hours.  Jamie and the entire Bayway Lincoln TEAM are amazing people to work with.  This is my second car to buy from Bayway Lincoln.  I wouldn't go anywhere else to buy one.

9,"June 19, 2018",Will not buy another car from here. Awful salesman did not seem as if he wanted to sale me a car. Poor service! Now I am having car problems ,1.0
10,"June 14, 2018","Mr. Ron Wilson, responded to my inquiry very promptly and professionally. One main thing that stood out is he was not one of those pushy car sales guys.. he listened to what I wanted then asked more questions.. made me feel he knew me and understood exactly what I was looking for.. he definitely delivered . I purchased my new Lincoln mkz and love it.. i would highly reccomend this dealership.",5.0

12,"October 05, 2017",I honestly never thought of  Lincoln as my dream car but I should  never say NEVER.  Jamie Sausser had been telling me how comfortable and safe it would be for work and he was correct. I am on the road most of the day and never felt more safe.. I love my MKC and can't see me driving anything but Lincoln.  ,5.0
13,"August 25, 2017","I purchased a 2015 MKZ Black Label on 6/22/17. Just had it serviced for low tire pressure and a loud humming noise at 40mph, 55mph and at 63mph. The Lincoln dealer in town discovered all 4 rims are bent, there are knots in my tires, the tires are worn and not in alignment. They stated it's unsafe to drive and demanded I leave the vehicle there. Bayway Lincoln sold me the vehicle this way by slapping brand new tires on bent rims thinking I wouldn't find out.  Each rim cost $1,800.00 to replace.  In the time I've driven my car, there is NO WAY I could've done this. This is a pre-existing condition. We've spoken to Barbie Watkins at Bayway and all she did was point fingers and blamed it on us saying she trusts her service department and we must have done something to the car. Instead of doing a thorough investigation FIRST and offering a solution, we were made the bad guys while Bayway isn't willing to stand on the Lincoln Promise that they have plastered on their website. They'd rather throw rocks and hide their hands instead.  I sent a detailed email to the CEO & President, VP and other director and managers and still haven't received a response. I'm am preparing to meet with my attorney if they do not respond by Monday. This is a serious matter that can not go ignored. Driving this car like this is putting my life and my families lives in great danger. ",1.2
14,"March 30, 2017","We traded in a Nissan and leased an MKX a year  ago.  Our sales rep was great !! BUT We were told we would get the cash back on our trade within 48 hours, by the GM and the finance manager.  IT TOOK THREE WEEKS !!!!!!!! .  I've since found out that this is long but reasonable.   BUT, I WAS LIED TO . They cannot be trusted.
Also, I left a number of messages for the owner, now all over the tv with his commercials. NEVER ANY RESPONSE!!!!!  Do not trust these people!!",1.0
15,"December 21, 2016","This dealership deserve 0 star. They are working only the way to get money by any means ,not for the costumer sutisfaction. The first day Mr Wallace tried us to sighn on wrong paper by adding more than one thousand dollars on the price we agreed two times. Second I told them that I want the car for business and to send me license plate with registration as soon as possible. But after 3 weeks they called me and asked me to pay $188.86 for the license and they couldn't start the process. Third the car wasn't clean and and has low air rear left tire and told me to bring it back. I bought to service and they filled air, didnt clean and told me has no problem with the tire. After 4 days the back foot step loose and the front electiric cover handle loose. Just I  took to garage to fix it. All're working to grap your money. I don't advice people to believe thier words.",1.2
16,"November 05, 2016","I've had nothing but the greatest service from Bayway Lincoln. It started with my leasing a 2014 MKZ Hybrid, then a 2015 MKC for my wife later. I then traded the MKC for a 2016 fully loaded MKX for my wife and then last month my fully loaded 2017 Continental arrived to replace my MKZ. Jamie Sausser has been my salesman each time and has done nothing short of delivering exceptional service with the up most respect. I have never been to a dealership where the most of the people remember who you are and address you by your name. Even my experiences in the service department have been exceptional. Great job Bayway Lincoln employees. ",5.0

18,"September 12, 2015","We had nothing but the best service. The crew Angel and Jose were awesome. Everybody there were friendly, and helpful.. They were absolutely very professional and they focus on what we needed ..they got us an amazing deal ... I would definitely recommend it to everyone who is looking to buy a vehicle...",5.0
19,"August 30, 2015","I've actually purchased from this dealer previously and returned to look at certified preowned Lincoln Models. I mistakenly went to the new vehicle building but met a very nice young man Daniel S. Who was very helpful. I'm giving my car shopping experience at bayway 2 stars because he was really outstanding, he's just handicapped by other elements within the dealership. Since they had a demo model, I decided to test drive a 2015 MKX  with 5,828 miles on it.  While the supervisors price quote was within market value range,  the quote on a 39 month lease was only $55 less than the outright purchase price / month... This when Lincoln website and other Lincoln dealerships were advertising leases at $450 per mo. ($220 -240 less than what they offered) for the MKX.  Still decided to give them a second chance and went back a week later to check out preowned vehicles.  I'd been in contact via Internet but the person I'd been communicating with wasn't in. So Mr. Hagen helped us. I test drove a 2012 MKX base and a 2015 MKC with 3K.  I was interested in the mkc but was informed that it had too few miles to qualify for the certified preowned vehicle program.  This was inconsistent with my research- as I'd looked at what was available in Houston metro area and seen several vehicles with less mileage that were CPO.  I concluded this is a dealership policy, not Lincoln's. At another dealer this car would have been eligible for an additional 50,000 mile warranty in addition to the remaining 37k on the manufacturer's warranty ....duh...really? Again the sales staff was very friendly, I think it's the  dealership level climate/policies that's problematic. I decided to look elsewhere - I hate to say this but ladies I think it would have been different if I had been a man.  After looking at other reviews on this website, I think I made the right decision to to visit a dealership on the west side of Houston where my experience was completely different. By the way, I purchased a CPO Lincoln MKX there and although it's farther away, it was well worth the trip.",1.8
20,"July 22, 2015",I cane to the dealership today with little hope of getting a car but he made sure that I did not leave his lot without one im so happy and blessed that Im back rolling in my own car again Thank you again Josue,5.0
21,"July 21, 2015",I saw their cars over the Internet. Called and negotiated a fair price over the phone. Negotiated my trade in over the phone as well. Asked them to have paper work ready for me  when I arrive. Very smooth transaction. VERY SATISFIED!,5.0
22,"July 11, 2015","This dealership deserves ZERO stars. They have been the definition of WORST costumer service and car buying experience EVER. My girlfriend and I were very much excited to purchase a 2006 Mercedes pre owned with them but from the beginning we received HORRIBLE customer service from the first car sales man we dealt with Angel. He was rude and blunt with us through out the whole process, however we decided to look past that because we loved this car and it was in great condition. Upon purchase we noticed the check engine light was on and we brought it to their attention but Angel insisted that it was absolutely nothing to worry about and that it would come off as soon we drove off. Stupid decision from our part. We had the car for two days and we were extremely happy with our purchase but it only took two days before it had problems and we had to take it back. They ended up figuring out that the car had major issues with its computer and they decided to back track our paper work and no longer sell it to us, they promised to give our money back and provided us with a loner car which was great until they began to harass us to return it  however we cannot return the car because these jerks have YET to give us our money back and without it we are not able to continue our car buying process else where. We have been yelled at by Wallace in accounting about the stupid loner car which trust me, we want to give them back ASAP but we also need our money. Jose has been another sales rep whom which we have been dealing with also, good guy, but has yet been able to make things right for us. It has been almost a month since this all happened, it has been an absolute nightmare working with them. Do not trust these liars, they have horrible integrity and work ethic. I will make sure to spread my thoughts on this dealership who has done absolutely NOTHING for us but put us through xxxx. We both work really hard for our money and to have that taken from us is extremely upsetting, not only are they still holding our down payment but after telling us that they would compensate the $200 we spent on insurance they decided to go back on their word. Horrible integrity! I hope people take all of this into consideration before making the decision to buy with them. ",1.4
23,"April 25, 2012","Just bought our second used car from this dealer. They are fair and honest. Lincoln also has a better warranty on their certified used cara then we could buy--6 years or 100,000 miles!  They have also been very attentive to any concerns I have had. Oh yea, and they filled the gas tank up!  Not many used car dealers do that anymore!  Thanks guys!  ",5.0
24,"December 08, 2011","My father (80 years old) leased a Mercury Milan from Bayway.  After a few months he returned the vehicle to the dealership.  He knew he would have to pay some type of early lease termination fee and left with the impression it would be around $2,000.  The vehicle had a few thousand more miles than when he leased, but was in excellent condition upon return.  He was later notified that they had taken the vehicle to the auction.  He was told that the difference in the auction price the vehicle sold for and his lease pay-off was $7,000.  Why they didn't tell him this was a possibililty, I have no idea.  Remember, this is an 80 year old man with limited lease knowledge.  After discussions with the dealership he paid them $4,000 and was told the lease would have a $0 balance.  They turned this into the credit agencies showing that the $3000 differnce was charged off. This has had a serious effect on his credit score.  Looks like a re-po.  Do not buy from these people!  All they care about is how much money they make.  This is why I rated them so low and plan to notify the BBB and the Attorney General concerning this transaction.  They should have sold the vehicle as a Certified Pre-owned and been able to minimize the difference.",1.8

26,"August 04, 2011","I took my car in for service on a Monday afternoon at the recommendation of a friend when I was having trouble with the front end on my 2010 Ford Taurus.  He assured me that he had a good expereience with this service center.

Tuesday afternoon I called Bridgett the Service Advisor around 1:00 because I had not received a call to advise me of the status.  When I spoke with her she informed me that is was likely the mechanic wouldn't be able to look at my car until the following Monday!

I informed her that it was not very good customer service to make a customer wait for a week.  Bridgett told me that I did not have an appt therefore that was going to be soonest they would get to it.  She also told me that whatever was wrong with it was not bad enough that I couldn't drive it until they got it in to be looked at.

I'm not sure when she became a certified mechanic but I can assure you that it is not wise of her or Bayway to allow someone that is not an expert to advise a customer to drive a vehicle that is having a problem.

Needless to say I picked my car up on a Tuesday and took it to their competior down the road.  It is now Thursday and it has been completed.  Bayway will never get my business again.",1.0
27,"March 21, 2011","Frederick, was willing to think outside the box, and went the extra mile to locate a vehicle that would meet our expectations. He allowed us to even take the vehicle and park it in our garage to make sure it fit properly, it showed us that he was flexiable and accomadating. He acknowledge that we had done our research and quickly advanced to the next inquiry without hesitation. Even though the price was not what we wanted, he made us think and reconsider other options that would make the price more pleasing to us. ",4.4
28,"July 23, 2009",By far the greatest store I have ever seen. My wife and I bought our Certified Lincoln Navigator from BAYWAY last month and we were pleased with all the processes we went through. The Salesman (Kenneth Stannilla) was knowledgable about every car he showed us and explained the Certified Program to the T. When we had a qustion that could not answer thats when he introduced us to his Salesmanager Josh who had the knowledge. We did not plan to buy that day but with the comparing of experiences we have been through we knew it was the place. Kenneth's Knowledge my wife thinks Josh is cute so that helped and then the wonderful service of Shane and Bridget. I have never seen anyone like these two in service you cant beat there smiling faces and quick service i will never buy anywhere else as long as this staff is here. BAYWAY is Family. ,5.0
29,"June 11, 2009","Bought an extended warranty on top of a 3 month one on a ""certified"" pre owned car. About a month later, the check engine light comes on so I take it to the dealership to get it serviced.

They charge me $95 dollars to do a simple diagonositcs and clear the check engine light, never knowing what caused it.

This is something AutoZone provides for free.

I have TWO warranties on this car and they still charged me $95...

I would NOT recommend going to them for servicing.

30,"January 26, 2009",Jamie helped me every step of the way with my purchase and took care of me on the last seven i bought. Every time i go to service He is there to greet me. Bridget and Shane in service are the best service advisors I have ever seen. These people are all about world class service. They live by that logo and represent it well. I will continue to purchase at this place for ever.,5.0
31,"July 14, 2008","I have had several bad experiences through out the 4 years I have had my Navigator. I bought in 2004 top of the line and Limited edition, it had rims,customized paint and several other extras. This past 
April I took it because the paint and rims were peeling off which the rimshave been repaleced like 4 times . Well to make things short now I'm being charged $251.00 because supposedly the paint was not peeling off on its own that it was consecuences of an accident which I was never adviced and they did everything behind my back. Now enterprise is charching me that amount when I was told several times that everything was going through the dealer. I feel they are just taking advantage and throwing the ball from one person to another. I really hope that the owner will read this and take a minute to deal with his customers. His workers seem not to care about customers.I feel I have been cheated. When I bought my Navigator I was told that everything was under warranty for 4 years or 50,000 miles well Stacy(the one that sells alarms ,rims etc) told me in April that the rims were only covered for one year so who is lying the sales man or her, and why pay 4,000 just for rims when with that money you can buy 2 sets of rims with tires somewhere else.",1.8

33,"November 05, 2004","My husband and I purchased a Lincoln LSE from the dealership (only dealer in town that had the LS-E) and we have been happy with them.  Usually you don't expect to have an on going relationship with your car dealer, but we do.  The only complaint I have is we have had the car in twice for the same issue on several different occassions.  Radio, CD Player, Brakes, Trunk emblem thing, and the Windshield wipers.  I don't know what it is, but in my experience, they can't seem to get it right the first time.  It's not too much of a bother b/c the staff is SUPER friendly and the warranty covered it all.",4.5
