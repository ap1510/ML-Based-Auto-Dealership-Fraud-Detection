0,"June 17, 2020",My wife and I purchased a new 2020 Highlander at Gullo Toyota the sales manager did a great job getting us approved. I thought this should be a nice experience buying a new Auto but our salesman kept telling us that he had already gone way and above helping us. I let him know that it was his job to help us. Then I spoke to the general manager and he was awesome he got us the color we wanted. But when my wife went to pick up the car we always thought that the salesman was supposed to get inside and go over everything and answer any questions and go over the book. But our salesman didn't do any of those things. My wife had to asked him where's the second key and he said it's in the book. And when she asked him to help set up the Bluetooth it seems the salesman was upset. I thought that they were supposed to take you for a tour of the dealership. And last thing for make ready was to go over the car with the customer and answer any questions you may have. My wife really likes the Highlander but still has a lot of questions about the car,3.0
1,"May 23, 2020","I worked with Mateo Villarreal in sales, and he was very patient with my evaluation and decision-making process, as well as being knowledgeable about options. I recommend him most highly. I also recommend Mike Payne in Finance. He easily accommodated my personal needs and desires. They made my buying experience as good as any I've had.",5.0
2,"May 11, 2020",It's nice to be able to go to a dealership and have full trust in the service being performed. I went to another dealership before Gullo and they told me my differential was leaking and quoted me high. When I took my truck to Gullo they said the diff was fine. Thank you for the honesty and great service!,5.0

4,"October 25, 2019","Just found out that my 100k plan does not cover Toyota-recommended replacement of my rear differential fluid @ 45,000 miles. Cost ~ $150-200. Seems very misleading to sell a maintenance plan that does not cover a simple fluid replacement. Read the fine print before paying for this plan.",3.8
5,"April 24, 2019","I purchased my vehicle 2 years ago and put rainguards on shortly after.  For 2 years I have been taking it there for a car wash.  Yesterday i was there for maintenance.  Shane came out all smiley, said someone would be with me shortly.  He told individual DO NOT WASH vehicle.  After washing vehicle for TWO years will no longer wash.  Poor customer service.  Smile in front of your face and then think you cannot hear them do this.  What else are they hiding.  ",1.4

8,"December 11, 2018","First time buying from a dealership, and everyone I dealt with at Gullo was so nice and helpful. I am so happy with my purchase! For a used vehicle, it is in excellent condition. They made sure to explain everything to me and made sure I was happy with my purchase. Sale people are very nice and friendly!",5.0
9,"August 10, 2018","I brought my car in for two recalls. The first, and the reason I brought the car in, was a faulty airbag, which, according to the manufacturer, could cause serious injury or death. The second was an electrical system component.

I originally asked the receptionist for an appointment at 7 AM, their regular opening time. But, since I needed to use their courtesy shuttle, she mentioned that it didn't start until 7:30 AM and that we should set the appointment for then. On arriving at the dealership at the appointment time, I noticed that the courtesy shuttle was leaving. After waiting in the lobby for forty minutes, their one and only courtesy shuttle came back and then took me to work. It's a good thing I didn't need to be at work at a specific time...

The ""customer service"" agent specified that the repairs would take about four to six hours. I mentioned wanting to pick up the car at about 3 PM. After being at work for an hour or so, I received a call from the dealership. However, it was just to sell me a windshield repair for a minuscule crack. ""How is work on the car going?"" I asked. The representative just responded that they work in a different department and he didn't know about that. (He just wanted to make easy money with an unnecessary fix.)

Almost seven hours later, after no additional calls from the dealership, I thought that they must be done or close to done, so I called them. Come to find out, they had started with the electrical fix first (the non-urgent one) as the airbag fix couldn't be done yet since they were lacking one of the parts. ""How soon can it be done?"" I asked, to which I received an answer of ""by the end of the business day.""

Then, within a minute or two of getting off the phone, he called me back to let me know that that part wouldn't be in for three to five business days and that I should just come to get the car now. After over an hour I was back (due to their one and only shuttle being too busy, as it is about a 15-minute drive), at which point I was given my car without the airbag having been repaired (the urgent, life-threatening matter per the manufacturer). At no point was I offered a loaner vehicle.

Two-and-a-half weeks later, they have still not called to finish the outstanding recall repair. (And, after this experience, I don't want to call them or go back there. I'll just go elsewhere to get it fixed.)",1.6
10,"August 03, 2018","I bought a car from Mr. Huy Bui at Gullo Toyota last month.  He is the most understanding internet sales manager that I have ever worked with.  When I sent out quote requests to various Toyota dealerships with my suggested price, many replies were simply too high compared with my budget.  Mr. Bui, however, offered me a good price in his first email and everything went smoothly since then.  After several emails, we settled down on the color and millage.  Then I came to Conroe to test drive my new car just shipped from the port with the right color, single digit millage and a full tank of gas.  I bought it immediately after the test drive.  Ms. Renee Hastings, Gullo's business manager, closed the deal efficiently without extra add-ons.  If I buy another Toyota some day, I will contact Mr. Huy Bui at Gullo Toyota of Conroe first.

12,"April 10, 2018","We spent all weekend trying to find our new car. We stopped here late Saturday & even though they were closed A. C. quickly showed us a few of their stock & offered to help us on Sunday. Our salesman was patient & helpful. The finance, of course, was a back & forth negotiation. The surrounding dealers were offering the same vehicle at $4000 less than Haas, with some or nearly all the same features as the one we’d chosen. So I felt like I was asking for a fair deal, not a discount. They did finally agree & I did receive a great finance deal from Toyota. I’m happy with my purchase. 
PROS:
 A.C was a great guide & salesman. 
There were several used & new models we were considering. 
Free coffee & soda. 
Thorough explanation & tour of our new vehicle. 
Thorough explanation of finance options & add ons. 

CONS:
Took entirely too long in finance. We arrived at noon & left around 6-7. We actually left after signing to eat since it took so long.  
Car not ready for us after signing all the paperwork, though we waited a good bit & gave extra time for detailing while we went to dinner. 
Haggling for a fair market price.
I felt like the head of finance directed most of his explanation to my husband though the purchase was mine. I don’t think he did it on purpose & corrected his measures when I pointed this out. 

All in all, it was a good experience & I’m happy with my vehicle, my purchase price & my financing. 
Would recommend. ",4.4
13,"September 29, 2017","My wife and I stopped by late one night this week not knowing much about the RAV4.  Lamar was very patient with us and explained all the features and there are a lot.  After our test drive Lamar showed us several more RAV4 with different options.  We test drove most of the SUV's in that category and we're pretty convinced we wanted a RAV4 but Lamar didn't pressure that night.  We went home that night and did more research comparing other dealership pricing in the Houston area.  We called Lamar the next morning and made him an offer on one of the RAV4 we looked at.  Lamar was able to help us get the deal we wanted over the phone.    After we purchased the vehicle Lamar spent another 40 minutes going over the many options again.  I would buy another vehicle from Gullo Toyota because of pricing, not being pressured, and a great young man Lamar Wright.  John H.

14,"July 02, 2017","Good price.  Odd that salesperson handed the negotiation off to someone else, who wanted to focus on monthly payment instead of agreeing on purchase price.  Pushed Toyota financing too hard and had to insist that financing get quotes from other sources.  Got 2.5% rate versus Toyota finance rate of 4.3%.",3.8

17,"June 03, 2017",Gullo Toyota helped us every step of the way in our car buying experience.  The best part was we were never really pressured into purchasing a vehicle.  We found the right van at the right price and didn't really have to haggle at all.  (Which is great!). They are very competitive with their prices and we found that they had the best deal.  We definitely recommend visiting Gullo.  ,5.0

19,"May 15, 2017",This dealership is one of the few that actually cares about you as a person. I totaled my 2016 Tundra in a freak accident and even though we didn't purchase it at Gullo Toyota they took care of us better than the original dealership did. The people who work here truly care about not just the product they sell but the people they sell to.,5.0

I am so happy with the customer service, I was a little unsure since it was my first time buying a car so the salesman let me drive it for a day to really feel if it was a good car for me.

30,"February 13, 2017","I have felt so disrespect by the staff that has been involved. I haven't stopped crying. I was fished in there with the excuse of having a venza ready for me. I feel betrayed. When I spoke to the GM, he asked me what happened, I told him (while crying my eyes out) and the first thing he says is ""do you want me to help you or are you going to interrupt me"". I don't understand why the staff thinks it's ok to raise their voice and disrespect me in such way. When I return the same tone of voice and manner that they treat me in, they hang up on me. Talk about double standards. 
I just wanted the toyota venza that I was told that was on the lot. I just wanted a bigger vehicle. I don't understand why this staff is being so difficult. I went tonight and they made me wait 30 min just to tell me there was no management there. ",1.0

32,"January 22, 2017","I did not intend to purchase a vehicle at the time I visited the dealership but, the salesman showed me what the payments would be and I ended up purchasing a Tundra. This car buying experience was the best I have ever had in my lifetime of buying a car or truck. There was no haggling over a price or payments. I told the salesman what I needed to have the truck payments at and I got what I asked for. The normal 3 to 4 hours spent in finance at other dealerships visited did not happen at Gullo Toyota. I was in and out in less than 45 minutes. In the future this dealership will be my first choice when I decide to purchase another vehicle. Thanks to all at Gullo Toyota for making this car buying experience so pleasant.",5.0
33,"October 29, 2016","Recently brought in my 2015 Tundra for 45k service, and was greeted by Brian Hopper. My regular service technician is Mason Cochran, but apparently he was out sick this particular day. Brian was very cordial, took great care of me and my truck, and worked with me to present what I thought was a great deal on 4 new tires for my truck. Brian made sure that the extra work was completed expeditiously, and that my truck was clean and shiny before leaving the dealership. I have enjoyed my relationship with Gullo Toyota, after moving my service work from another dealer just south of this location. I am always greeted with a smile and a firm handshank, and made to feel that the overall health and wellbeing of my truck is as important to them as it is to me. Thank you for all you do Brian, Mason, and the entire Gullo Toyota team!",5.0

41,"September 01, 2016","Mr. Huy Bui was our sales rep. Even from the beginning when I was emailing and requesting quotes, his responses were fast and polite. He gave us a great deal on a 2017 toyota camry. The finance guys we spoke to I believe Paul was one of them and I can't remember the name of the other guy but they were nice and fast as well. I got out of there in under 3 hours with my brand new car. They even set up my oil change for me without me even asking. It was a great experience. I even got to return my rental car at the location so that i didn't have to travel to return it at a different location. They for sure took great care of us. I would recommend using them. They have a great inventory of cars and so it made it easy for us. They answered all of our questions and took really great care of us while there. They even gave my 2 year old a coloring book so that she had something to do while we waited.

42,"August 27, 2016","We drove 3 hours from Austin to buy a 2003 4Runner that we found online. Before departing, we contacted Michael Forbes at the dealer and asked if our daughter from Texas A&M could come test drive it. No problem! She said Michael was the ""sweetest man in the world"" and she was happy with the car. She also said a lot of people wanted to look at the car, so we asked Michael if there was any way to hold it for us while we drove from Austin. With a $500 deposit, which we would get back if we didn't buy the car!, the car was there when we arrived.

Michael took us for a test drive, led us to the finance department, detailed the car, and we were done within 2 hours.

After noticing a good price at Gullo Toyota Conroe, we decided to stop by. Jarren McCartney was our salesman. Even with only recently getting hired at this dealership, he was a great help with our car search. In comparison to the 6 other salesman all over houston, he was hands down the best. His sales manager Michael Payne was also great in answering more specific questions relating to this buy.

91,"March 03, 2016","I had been hospitalized and in a rehabilitation facility for several months following hip replacement surgery. One week ago, I was informed that my last full day in rehab was that day and I had to leave the room by 11 AM the following day. I needed a vehicle with a high seat entry and door clearance to allow my new hip to clear the entrance without pain. From previous experience, I knew that a compact SUV would provide the dimensional clearance I needed. 

My friend had begun searching the top-rated compact SUV's the previous week and test-drove a CRV, a Forester, and finally, a RAV4 the day before I learned that I had to leave rehab. She preferred the ride, the visibility and the outstanding interior and exterior features of the RAV4 Limited that Mr. Brock Willett of Gullo Toyota in Conroe had shown her and helped her with the test drive and selection. The dealership had just received this vehicle and it was more than I had expected but was what I had always wanted in features.

When Mr. Willett learned the morning following the test drive that we wanted that car but needed delivery either that evening or the next morning, he emailed me an upfront price for that vehicle. I called him, completed the deal, worked out the financing with Gullo, and he prepared all of the paperwork that I needed to sign. My friend picked up the documents, brought them to me for signature, and Mr. Willett and I agreed to a 10 AM delivery at my friend's residence the day I had to leave! The delivery was made as promised, I could leave rehab on time and return home!

Throughout this very time-dependent transaction, Mr Willett was low-pressure but very professional, and by his response showed that he was truly concerned about my needs. I have been purchasing new vehicles since 1970, and never have I been treated so graciously by Mr. Willett or by Gullo Toyota as I have with this experience.

94,"February 29, 2016","We purchased a bumper to bumper 6 year extended service agreement through Toyota when we purchased a new Sienna. We had two issues that should have been covered under the agreement, but were refused. The first was that the A/C compressor went out. We were told that somehow it was our fault and they would not replace it. Had it replaced through Driver's Auto since Gullo guys were not nice at all. Second problem was that the driver's side seatbelt would not retract. My husband would have replaced the retractor himself but since it is associated with the side air bag, it needed to be done by a dealership. When I went into Gullo, I was told that it was happening because I was putting my seat belt on ""like a girl."" When, I told them I should be able to put it on safely even ""like a girl,"" they told me to put it on like a man and I wouldn't have any problems.

145,"August 07, 2015","When I bought my vehicle, I was treated disrespectfully by the salesman, but the sales manager was great and saved the deal.  Since that time, I've had plenty of other issues.

First, the vehicle was sold as a Certified Used Toyota, but needed a windshield to complete the certification process.  The dealership said they would contact a mobile glass company to come to me and have a new windshield installed, so that I could drive the vehicle home that day.  A week went by with no contact from them about the windshield.

I was contacted during that first week, only to inform me there was some other work that needed to be done for the certification process, asking that I bring the truck back one week after buying it.  I did, and at that time asked about my windshield.  It was then that the dealership contacted a glass company.  The glass company contacted me the following day and finally scheduled my windshield replacement.

The windshield that Gullo Toyota paid to have put in my vehicle was a very cheaply made aftermarket windshield, which has visible warping and distortion in the glass.  This glass doesn't come close to the quality of the factory windshield and thus should not be considered acceptable to certify a vehicle.  Gullo Toyota should have specified to the glass company that the glass installed must be equal in quality to its factory counterpart, and should have covered the cost of that quality of glass.  This should have happened without me needing to complain or even ask!

Besides the windshield debacle, there was also part of the interior of the vehicle that it seems was not inspected.  It's very minor, just the sleeve around the shift knob that had come unfastened from where it should be clipped in place.  This allows items to be dropped down into the space below the shifter or cupholders.  While it isn't a huge problem, it shows the vehicle wasn't inspected and reconditioned with the attention to detail that is commensurate with the Toyota Certified program.

A much larger issue centers around the vehicle I traded in.  I provided the payoff statement for the vehicle, which clearly stated the payoff quote was valid through Aug. 4 -- a full ten days after I purchased my vehicle.  The dealership didn't manage to pay the vehicle off until Aug. 6, when the payoff quote was no longer valid.  This resulted in me getting charged another payment for my old car, nearly two weeks (12 days to be precise) after I traded it in!

I'm hopeful that contacting the dealership will result in resolution of these issues.  The larger problem though, is that when a customer purchases a Certified Used vehicle, he/she shouldn't have to contact the dealership over such things.  The vehicle is guaranteed to have been reconditioned to ""exacting standards"" by Toyota factory trained technicians.  There should be no way that a vehicle leaves the lot without a factory-quality windshield (either installed or scheduled to be installed), and a part of its interior detached.  Furthermore, there should never be an instance in which a trade-in is not paid off before the next payment is due, if that trade-in is accompanied by paperwork clearly stating that the payoff is valid for ten days.",2.4

Clayton Lewis demonstrated his patience and understanding while assisting my search for my desired vehicle.  His work ethic and honesty were very apparent and he made the entire process seem easy.

Ms. Polozola has been extremely accommodating in setting up service appointments for both my self & my French 'ex-pat' husband: both of us work downtown Houston, so the commute from The Woodlands, for my husband is about 45 miles/ each way; it is easier for him to go to the Toyota dealership near Sugar land, where he works.

Debby Polozola is the reason WE both service our vehicles in Conroe. As a woman, driving at late hours in Houston highways, I feel safe after my car maintenance with Debby, as she understands my concerns with the technical engineering problems that are intertwined with driving long distances. Also, she takes the time to fix Toyota Recall issues, that I might not be aware of.

To conclude, if Debby Polozola ever decides to leave this Dealership, we will leave, too! A couple of my husband's colleagues are about to start servicing their vehicles in Conroe, choosing Ms. Polozola...

Subject:  Service Review for Gullo Toyota - Brian Hopper

Brian Hopper has made our 2013 Toyota Camry service experience
especially rewarding.  He is everything you would want in an 
auto service customer representative.  He is friendly, available, knowledgeable, efficient, and best of all, he goes out of his way to make sure you are 
satisfied with the service experience at Gullo Toyota.

Brian has personally researched answers to questions about
our Camry that most customer service reps would have dropped.  
For example, when our new Camry’s garage door opener system failed to
operate our home garage door opener, he researched and found that our home garage door opener was outdated and would not interface with the Camry
opener system.  He did additional research and found a company and
interface unit that could be added to our home garage door opener system
to make it compatible with the Camry’s garage door opener system.

He gave us the name, address, phone number and part number 
that would make our garage door opener system function properly
with the Camry.  We followed his directions and recommendations
and solved the home garage door opener problem.

More recently, he provided timely service oversight in the order and 
replacement of a rear seat back cover of our Camry that was gaping open.
He ordered the part for repair of the seat back cover and informed us of
its arrival at Gullo.

We had a medical appointment at 1:00 pm. in The Woodlands on October 13
so he scheduled the service appointment for 9:00 am. on that day and worked with the technician to replace the seat back cover in time for us to travel to the appointment without requiring a loaner auto.  That is excellent service!

They can't even get it right and the worst part is that the so called ""manager"" of the  dealership came to us and told us that, ""you are WASTING MY TIME.""

275,"November 26, 2012","Let me start this review by summarizing my overall first impression after recently having purchased my first Toyota from this Dealer; responsive, friendly, quick and professional, outstanding selling price, no BS.

My experience began over the phone with Gullo Toyota because I live about 300 miles from the Conroe Dealer. They had 'the' truck I was searching for, so I didn't mind taking the day to drive down, do the paperwork, and drive back home. Upon arrival, the Reps that I had made arrangements with the day prior, were not at the office yet. So Glynn Hebert quickly picked up the ball and we worked together to finalize the deal. 

I informed Glynn that I was from out of town, in a rush to get back home to visiting Family for the holidays, etc. He was sensitive to my needs and clearly worked very hard to get me out of there as soon as possible. I can't thank him enough for that. 

Now, the reason I have given such high review marks is partly due to the price I paid for the truck. You see, it is a special edition, one of only 2 available in Texas that week. The Dealer knew that and yet still came down to a very fair price for me. Actions speak louder than words. 

After the signing of the deal, the truck was washed, filled up with fuel, and I was on my way. Total time spent at the Dealer - 3hrs. I'm very much a satisfied Customer. ",5.0

The whole process was very quick and painless and I have a beautiful new vehicle with all the bells and whistles.  Glynn took the time to introduce me to everyone at the dealership; although I have been buying from Gullo Toyota for the past 15 years there were some new faces.  Glynn was professional, friendly and was able to deliver what he said he would.  He was a pleasure to deal with and great with after purchase follow up. In additon, Tony (the finance guy)was professional, pleasant and thorough, which made that process quick and painless.

He does his best to keep you satisfied.  I have to say  there has not been a time when I walked into this dealership and I am not a truly happy customer.  I would never buy another car from anyone other than Gullo due to these two people who make the process seamless and enjoyable.  I tell everyone how much I like my car dealership.  Cars are the second most important item you buy in your lifetime and these people make that a nice easy process.  Keep up the good work Gullo.  I look forward to many more years of having a great relationship with you.

Mr. Auchter has a genuine desire to please his customers without the high-pressure sales tactics of other dealerships.  He took the time to thoroughly explain all the systems of our new Tundra.  Also others at the dealership were equally sincere and informative like the business managers, Lloyd and Kris. We are very pleased with our experience in buying a new Tundra from Gullo Toyota, and looking forward to using the dealership in the maintenence phase of our new truck.

295,"June 26, 2010","To whom it may concern:

I went on line to many dearlerships and requested information about a new Prius. Gullo gave me the answers I ask for the first time around. Second, They were the only dealership that stood behind what they said. They were honest and did not just try to get me in to the sales department. Tony, one of the owners and his brother made themselves available and were pleasent and offer to assist me in everyway. 

Robert Todd, my salesman, kept his word that was given in the emails and gave me a selection of cars that no one other dealership had available. They let me test drive numerious Prius and did not ever pressure me in any way. I knew exactly what I want to buy. Then they got me the EXACT Prius I wanted.

We closed on our new Prius and have been extreamly pleased with the car and the experience at Gullo.

I would recommend that anyone looking to purchase a Toyota to visit Gullo before making your final decisions on where to buy.

301,"May 09, 2010","Earlier in the week I had a scheduled oil change and Kim graciously wrote it up and all went well. A day or two later I was back with my car being towed in on a wrecker. Doug was handling it, however, Kim came out to greet me, remembering I had just been there. Why I was being towed is a long story--the happy ending is the fair price, the immediate service and the value of my time. I was encouraged to remain inside until the car was where it needed to be so I would be safe--an assessment was made and a possible cost and time were quoted. I was informed I could be taken home by shuttle or rent a car for the day...I chose to wait since I knew the service was going to begin fairly soon. I came with books to sit in the comfortable waiting area by the desk and study. Later, a reasonable amount of time, Doug told me I didn't need a new tire after all and that he couldn't believe it either. He had the technician test drive the car to be certain all was well. That saved some money. The technician was able to repair one side and replaced the rim on the other. I expected to have to replace both rims, a tire and have the frame worked on. I left feeling safe and blessed to have money in my pocket. I love my Toyota and what your team does to keep my Toyota working! Thank you one and all. Fran Querio.",5.0

308,"April 14, 2010","I recently bought a used vehicle from Gullo, and I was very happy with the overall service and honesty of the Used Car Internet manager Sean Loftice. He was honest, not pushy and very accomodating to work with. This was a real refresher for used car sales. He even allowed us to drive the vehicle for a couple of days beforehand and accomodated our schedule. We did end up purchasing the vehicle and are very happy with it. I obtained financing outside of the dealership prior to the purchase, for the specific reason of not wanting to haggle with the financing department and the time of purchase. 
Once we completed paperwork with Sean, we were taken to the Finance Dept to finalize paperwork and were handed over to Craig Barrum-Finance Manager who proceeded to try and convince us to purchase the Extended Warrany through Gullo and also complete the financing paperwork through Gullo as it would save us the time of going to the bank. After spending 45 minutes with him trying to call our Bank and confirm financing could be processed there, he finally gave up and allowed us to complete the financing off site as originally planned. He continued to try and sell the Extended Warranty and in the end, was rude about us turning it down. I questioned the paperwork he was requesting me to sign(AS-IS No Warranty) because the vehicle we purchased still had 2 months of the Original Factory 3 year ,36,000 mile warranty as well as the 3 month 3,000 mile Toyota Certified Warranty on it. After a heated debate, he wrote it in on the paperwork in order to clarify what we were questioning and then told me 'I am dismissed, you can leave now' I DO NOT appreciate being talked to like a child and harrased and lied to because we 1. Did not trade in a vehicle 2.Did not purchase their Extended Warranty and 3. Did not finance thru them. 
I would not recmmend Gullo Toyota to anyone for these reasons. Craig managed in 45 minutes to negate every bit of confidence , trust and loyalty that Sean built up over a week's time period of interaction. His rude, pressuring tactics will ensure I will never return to Gullo again and ensure that I will make sure I tell anyone I can about his behavior. ",3.3

313,"January 07, 2010","I contacted Gullo Toyota while searching on the internet for a new Tundra Crewmax. Gullo had the truck in stock, equipped exactly as I wanted and priced right. I live far away in Memphis Tennessee, it may sound crazy but I flew into Houston and picked it up.  My entire experience was simple, painless and quick.  I only had to deal with the internet manager, Michael Payne.  He was extremely knowledgeable and efficient.  I offered to give them a down payment in order to hold the truck for four days until I could fly in but Michael said it was not necessary.  Once I arrived at Gullo the entire process was simple and efficient.  We went over the paperwork, test drove the vehicle, went through the owners manual and reviewed the maintenance schedule.  I met the finance manager, told him I only wanted the truck and nothing else (extended warranty).  He understood and did not try to pressure me into anything else.  In a few minutes we were done.  Wow, vehicle purchasing made easy, no headaches, no bickering, truly car buying how it should be!

314,"August 21, 2009","Can we return to a time where people honored their word?  A time when a code of ethics ruled, and a sense of honor and dignity prevailed?  I suppose not, as every time we stick our hands out for a handshake and believe we both are doing the honorable thing, we later learn that they just smiled back at us thinking ""suckers!""  I honestly hope that we do not change, but over the years one can only take so many hits before they become so cynical of everyone that we simply have to believe everyone is out to rip you off and if you don't take that attitude towards them, they will get the better of you.  I just don't want to become that person.

This is all related to our latest experience this past week at Gullo Mazda.  As you may have read if my other blog relating to our wonderful GM Malibu Maxx, we were anxious to get out of this.  Now my wife is an avid researcher so we, as quickly as we could, began our hunt for some foreign cars.  We landed at Gullo Mazda to test drive a few cars to see what we were interested in.  We test drove a few Toyota's (these two dealerships are side-by-side) and an older Sienna which the price seemed nice and we could pay cash for it and not have to finance anything.  We left for the day and did a bit more research and everything we could find pointed us to the decision that the van was a good price as well as a Mazda 6 that were being advertised at another dealship far far away.  So going back up there two days later, we test drove a comperable Mazda 6 and began negotiations on it as we wanted something a bit newer than the van was offering.  During this process, we learned that the Sunfire was trading at a price higher than we both expected and decided that trading both our cars in for a Toyota van and Mazda 6 was our best opportunity to get out of both of these cars and use that leverage of buying two vehicles for the same dealership the same day for a better price.

We were told by our salesman that the van being a 2000 model with 113K miles on it only qualified for a 30 day limited warranty and because we were buying on site and signing that night, we were told that we could take it to our mechanic and have it looked at for any issues that may not have been seen that evening as they didn't want us to leave without buying.  So with those ""promises"" in place and us being gulible in believing that they would honor their word we purchased both vehicles and drove home very happy.

On the second day of ownership, we had our opportunity to drop off the van at our mechanics for a look over and he determined that we needed the following:

    * New timing belt which also required a new water pump per Toyota standards.
    * The power steering pump had fluids on it indicating that it was leaking.
    * Valve cover was leaking oil.
    * Radiator hoses were dry rotting.

All of which we would not know needed to be replaced and was the main reason we negotiated this prior to sale that we would have the opportunity to have this looked at our mechanic.  Obviously, if these items were known, they would have been requested fixed PRIOR to sale, but we had our assurances!

So I call our salesman up only to get a voicemail which was left on Friday morning.  We call throughout the day and I finally ask the receptionist if he is in and was told that he is probably with a customer at the moment.  Saturday morning, no return calls.  So I call for the manager, and again was forced to leave a message.  Again we call throughout the day and again, only voicemails.  We did later learn that the salesman left a message on our home phone Saturday morning, but explained ""...we have customers that have mechanics check out the vehicle before they purchase them, uah, so you know, basically we really don't feel responsible for any of that stuff...""

Once received that message late Saturday afternoon, I first called for our salesman and yet again, voicemail.  This time I am not giving up until I speak with someone.  So after 5 calls to the operator who first disconnected me, then transfered me before I could finish my request, and finally told her bluntly that I want to speak to a person in charge now and will not stop calling  until I get a person to speak with.  Also, we were already in the car and decided to make a personal visit if we have too.  Finally, she is able to get the used car manager on the line (the one who also worked with our salesman) and I explained the situation.  I was told that there is no 30 day warranties on vehicles over 100K and that the salesman just mispoke when he offered that too us during our purchase.  Oh that's just dandy and BS!  He also stated that mechanics like to drum up business and that their people would have to look at it first.  So we had an understanding that the van would be dropped off that Monday morning for a review of what our mechanic found.

So we call around 4:00 Monday afternoon as we have heard nothing from Gullo about the van.  I call and left yet another voicemail with the manager as we need to know when we might get this back as we are now functioning on one car.  Again, no call backs and again I am forced to call them to get the service department who tells us that they see no problems with the power steering pump.  The one item that I could possibly hold their feet to the fire as this was a safty issue.  We already had to pay a grand for the radiator hoses and timing belt as we knew that they would cover that as part of their ""gotcha"" campaign  They wanted to keep it another day to ensure that it isn't leaking.

Tuesday afternoon comes around and again no calls from Gullo.  I call the services department first to get a guy who knows nothing about this van and was transferred to the manager only to again get a voicemail.  I leave a message.

Wednesday is now here and you guessed it, no call backs from my messages left inquiring about a status.  I again call the service department, I am pretty pissed at this point and was told that the power steering pump is fine and that there is only ""seapage"" on the valve cover...certainly nothing that they would deam to be an issue.  He also gave me the name of a lady who deals with these types of customer issues.  But guess what!....another voicemail.  So I explain as best I could and through gritted teeth my situation.  Graciously, she calls back within the hour after speaking with the manager and we are told that they are keeping the van until the new rearview mirror is in as part of our original agreement...only we were told on the voicemail from the salesman last Saturday, that it would be the following Monday before the mirror comes in.  So I explained my issues with the lack of communication and that we would never leave our car there for over a week while waiting for a freakin' mirror.  She offers us a loaner while we wait on that issue.

So during our lunch on Wednesday, we drive down there to get the loaner car.  Both the salesman and the manager ignore us completely and we get the loaner from another salesman who knew nothing of our situation.

The very next morning, we get a call from our salesman that our van is ready to be picked up.  WTF?  If we knew it was going to be the next damn morning, we would have waited.  So during Thursday's lunch we drive down their to get our van with all the known issues that they refuse to repair and we part our ways.

Only the battery fries after my wife turned the car off.  I call the salesman just because I am pissed and how about that....they guy answers his phone for the first time in over a week!  Hmm...I have to wonder that he thought we were gone for good and he could now pick up the receiver.  His comment to us is that we are stuck with it.  I bitched him a thank you and hung up on him.",1.2
