0,"August 20, 2018","After applying and being approved for auto financing online at Mike Smith Smith Nissan, I agreed to drive from 5 hours away to test drive and pick up my used car on 6/23/18. When I arrived in Beaumont on 6/23/18, I was quoted the car's price and told that the car needed to be sent to Houston for a week for repairs at a major dealership. I agreed to return to test drive and pick up the car on 6/30/18. When I returned on 6/30/18, the salesperson told me that repairs were made to the car's braking system and the car would cost me an extra $2,000. I agreed. When I got into the Finance office, I requested as much GAP coverage as possible. Instead of the Finance Manager maximizing the coverage requested, he bundled a lower GAP coverage with two other warranties I was not interested in and told me that the GAP coverage I wanted was not available. When I looked at my paperwork later, I discovered that he only gave me the first page of each warranty agreement. I sent certified mail to two of the warranty providers to cancel the coverage, so that I could buy my own after-market warranties. The two providers refunded my money to the dealership as of 7/30/18. As of 8/20/18, the dealership has failed to remit the warranty refunds to my auto loan lien-holder. Additionally, on 8/16/18, a title representative from Mike Smith Nissan called me and said that my vehicle plates would not be ordered unless the car was inspected. It's not legal to sell a car without having a state inspection performed on the vehicle. My temporary plates expire on 8/29/18. I went into a Group1 dealership on 8/17/18 to have the car inspected, and the dealer advised that the car was probably not inspected for mechanical issues if the state inspection was not completed. I have been advised that the repairs to the braking system on the car will be costly. Additionally, I have been advised to retain legal counsel as Mike Smith Nissan has broken several laws and regulations of warranty agreements during this transaction. This is the worst experience ever. ",1.0
1,"April 17, 2017","Please be careful if you get your car serviced at Mike smith Nissan........ I had a drive chain recall issued on my car, I spoke with the service manager after they ran the diagnostic and he told me I needed a 11,000$ new engine ,my oil was black and sludgey either because I was not changing my oil or because I was not getting it changed by Nissan. At this time they told me there was no point to get the recall done. I advised them to do the recall, because I knew I changed my oil when I am supposed to, they kept my car over a week all the while having salesman call me everyday trying to sell me a car. I get my car back and it is running very rough, when I get down the road, my service engine light comes on. I had already planned to bring it to get a second opinion, so I brought it to twin city Nissan and they are amazing! They ran the tests and told me in fact I do not need a new engine, but the recall was done incorrectly by mike Smith Nissan. No sludge at all in my engine ,they pulled my Carfax which has all my oil changes logged in it. Mike Smith Nissan lied to me,tried to rip me off and treated me very rude. On the other side of this Twin city Nissan was kind and helpful, made sure we had a rental car{Mike Smith denied me a rental car}. They also called and gave me updates{Mike Smith did not}. I also called the Mike Smith GM and left messages with no callback. So please be careful, always get a second opinion. ",1.0
