0,"December 05, 2018","Adam Reynolds helped us find the perfect RAV-4 auto.  He was so helpful showing us the features on the auto and instructing us how to operate everything.  He was courteous, knowledgeable and exhibited outstanding customer service.  He navigated us thru the entire process with patience, and  without the normal stress experienced when buying a new vehicle.  Would definitely refer friends and family to Adam Reynolds and  Classic Toyota, Tyler, TX.   Adam and the pyjrt Dealership staff deserve a 5 Star rating.  ",5.0

2,"June 29, 2018",My rating is because Mr. Jalyn Rattler I believe went above and beyond his duties.  He was. more than patient with us.  He took time to show us different cars and even once the car was purchased if i had a concern he immediately checked on it and followed up with the departments he needed to.   I am pleased with everything.,3.8
3,"October 28, 2017","We took our Tundra in for the air bag inflator recall. We picked up our vehicle and later found that the air bag cover was sticky.  We call Classic and talked to Mike Grasty and he told us there was nothing that they could do about the problem.. The rest of the dash was in excellent condition and so was the air bag cover when we brought it in. We called Toyota Corporate and they told us they would allow a Goodwill warranty. We called back and no one would return our call.. we called Parts and they told us that the part was discontinued.  We called Family Toyota and they had the part in two weeks and installed it. Pretty bad when you have to drive all the way to Burleson, TX to get a repair. I gave them 1 star because you can't give them zero",1.0
4,"January 06, 2017","The best place I have ever been to buy a car. The salesman JUSTIN MCDONOLD  was very kind and courteous. He made me feel like a friend. the car I wanted had been sold so we looked at the 2017 Toyota Corolla LE and man was i impressed buy the room in the back set and WOW the room in the front is most impressive. To be 6 foot 3 inches tall and be able to find tons of leg room was fantastic. For a few hundred dollars more it was well worth the $. Justin made it happen even though i didn't have all the paperwork i needed. He was there with me 110 percent. classic Toyota made a friend and I found a new family.    10 out of 10 and 99.99 percent satisfied with the Corolla. my wife was very happy which makes me happy. miles of smiles.       

THANK YOU JUSTIN 
&THANK YOU CLASSIC TOYOTA FOR JUSTIN AS MY SALESMAN.",5.0
