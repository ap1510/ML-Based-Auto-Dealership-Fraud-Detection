4,"April 13, 2017","Not many dealerships listen. I mean really listen. I was not an easy buyer. My budget and needs were very specific. I started working with Hoffpauir Ford (manager Rick and salesman KC) in November. They committed to the fact that it may take sometime. Not many dealerships that would commit months to make a sale but they did. KC would follow up every month keeping me in the loop. Rick & KC both worked hard and made me feel welcome. They used ever resource they had, even looking at their other dealerships to find a solution. To most women, buying a vehicle is a dreadful experience. Honestly I would rather chew tinfoil :-) With that in mind, you can imagine my joy when I got the truck I set out to find 5 months prior. I can't wait to have my next Hoffpauir experience. My dealership for life! They are truly good people! ",5.0
