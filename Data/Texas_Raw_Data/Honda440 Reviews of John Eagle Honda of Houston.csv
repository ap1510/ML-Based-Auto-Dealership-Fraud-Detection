From start to finish everyone at the dealership was honest, kind, and knowledgeable. They were all super helpful and determined to make sure i left in a car I loved and at an amazing value. 
I will recommend anyone i know to come here and get their next vehicle ! ",5.0

2,"November 18, 2019","Worst experience ever, their is one sales person whose name is Abdul Haq Sheikh he provided me the wrong information about my monthly and other related information also.  Never go to John eagle.  Worst staff I have ever seen.  They are not helpful.",1.0
3,"November 15, 2019","My wife brought her 2011 Honda Pilot in on 11/9/2019 due to check engine light on in the instrument panel. We have used this Service Dept. for approx. the past 4 years and have always had good experiences with them and them to be honest & forthright.  The car had a P0302 misfire code.  The mechanic & Service Advisor (Anthony Olson) advised that oil was passing the piston rings, however the car has never burned oil, nor does it now. We were advised that we needed a new engine for the car at a cost of $ 6,130.08. This just didn't pass the ""smell test"" with me, so we took it to another A.S.E. Certified Repair Shop & told them no more information that we told John Eagle Honda. This shop also got the misfire code, and said that an ignition coil had gone bad on one of the cylinders causing the spark plug not to fire. This other shop changed the bad coil & changed all of the Iridium/Platinum spark plugs, did a tune-up cleaned the fuel injectors, and a fuel injection system all for under $ 900 and the car now runs as good as it ever did & still does not burn oil.  
Maybe since it is close to the holidays some employees (mechanics & service advisors) felt the need for a large commission on a large ticket repair job... who knows?  
Once trust is gone how do you get it back? Don't believe I'll ever set foot on the premises of this dealership again!",1.0

7,"September 04, 2019","After visiting several Honda dealers in Houston, looking for a 2019 Ridgeline, I managed to get the best deal and service, Justino Morales who helped me was great. Since the first visit he did his best to get me a great price without been push, he tried his best to give the best discount I was able to find, very helpful and patient answering the many questions I had about the different models. I definitely recommend John Eagle if you're looking to get the best service and price. Thank you guys!",5.0
8,"May 23, 2019","I highly recommend my sales person Sekou! He's a good person and a pleasure to work with. The dealership itself is pretty classy based on my experience--I enjoyed the clean and open ambiance and warmth of the staff, appreciated their willingness to accommodate, and am impressed with the great care they seem to take of the vehicles they house. Of course, do your homework on car buying before going to any dealership...",4.8
9,"April 08, 2019","I’m out of state, and bought my car from John Eagle Honda. I’m forever grateful for Cameron and the entire team for all of their help! They made the process seamless, easy, and they went above and beyond every step of the way. They have incredible communication and customer service - I felt like family! I can’t recommend them enough, plus I love my car!!",5.0
10,"April 08, 2019","The overall deal on the car was ok, but the cost breakdown explanations were confusing and the staff could either not explain it would not explain it in a reasonable amount of detai. Instead, the tactic was to talk really fast and deflect any direct questions. Additionally, the sales representative kept disappearing and we were left wondering what was going on for hours..literally hours. Many times, I observed the sales rep joking around with his co-workers instead of focusing on our deal. There was a number of times that I considered leaving. In the end we purchased the car, but only because it was a reasonable deal, not because of the service. Even though, this was my 2nd vehicle purchased from this dealership, I would not recommend this dealership to anyone in the future if you value transparency and your time.

12,"February 12, 2019","Abel is the best car sales person I have dealt in a long time. He was prompt, accurate, courteos, fair, reasonable and provided every answer to our questions. We left the dealership with a brand new car and the satisfaction of a fair deal carried on with respect and professionalism. This is my first Honda but it I decide to trade it in or buy another one I would make sure to call Abel first. Great; positive experience! Thank you, Abel! ",5.0
13,"January 28, 2019","I collected bids from several dealerships on a new 2019 Honda HRV.
The salesman, Shawn was by far the most courteous and informed of all the people I'd met at the various dealers.
I ended up with the best price, but the real reason we chose them was the courteous professional staff. 
Once we decided to buy, we were in and out in about an hour.  
Even the finance manager was great.

14,"December 18, 2018",I went to this dealer because it’s a big dealer and i though i could trust them in buying a good car right there but it wasn’t like that. When i bought my car right there no one told me that that car has an accident before i bought it in fact they told me that it had a clean record. Appearently they are used to lie to they’re customers like they did to me. Now im trying to find a solution to my problem and all they want to do is get the value of my car when they know that my car’s value is really low because of the accident. It’s a shame that such a big dealer like this one lie to they’re customers in order for them to sell cars specially when this car cost me 23000 dollars. ,1.0
15,"November 27, 2018","Took my 2006 Honda Civic to their service dept and they gave me an accurate quote, did the job right and gave me a three year warranty.

16,"November 02, 2018","Had to replace the engine in my 08 Civic, short story i have a slammed Civic, hit a rock due to construction on jones rd. And ruined the engine in my car, took it to honda to have it replaced, allyne was very helpfull keeping me updated on the progress on the work being done. Even after the work was completed the car was not not running right ( due to a second party engine  rebuild NOT JHON EAGLE HONDAS FAULT AT ALL) he made sure i was happy and that my car was exactly the way it was before the rock incident. Needless to say Allyne did everything he could to help me out on cost and labor due to the second party rebuild shop mistakes. If your ever in need of an excellent Service advisor Allyne is the man for the job. ",5.0
17,"October 09, 2018",Went in recently to buy a new vehicle and Justino in sales and Leonta in finance made it a painless process. Justino new that i was looking at two vehicles and brought both of them side by side so that I could conpare the two. Once I made a decision is was all done but the paperwork. Leonta came in a got me a better interest rate which lowered my monthly. I would definitely work them again!! Thanks guys,5.0
18,"July 22, 2018","This was my first time going to a car dealership in need of a car myself. The employees are friendly and patient so that I could get the most suitable car. Unlike many car dealerships, John Eagle Honda employees are not there to push the customers into a sale, but instead are as helpful as possible in letting the customers see every option available. Overall, I was very pleased with my experience and will go back for future purchases.",5.0
19,"July 12, 2018","I bought a new 2014 Honda Accord from John Eagle Honda, and he car is now 1 year outside of the warranty. I'm having paint issues. I called service, and Chris was no help. He said to take it to a body shop. It's not a scratch or dent. The paint is coming off on the trunk. This is my second Honda Accord, and from the looks of it, will be my last. The Customer service was not good. Apparently, there are paint issues with the Accords. I should NOT be having paint issues within 4 years. Very disappointed.",1.0
20,"June 22, 2018","Recently purchased a new Honda Civic from John Eagle Honda and couldn't be happier with the customer service we revived. Our salesman Joe Coleman was very knowledgeable of the cars and helped us find the perfect one. He listened to what we needed and respected our budget which made the buying process a  breeze. The Finance Manager we worked with was Darryl Burns (didnt see his name on here to select) everyone knows the finance side of buying a car can be confusing and frustrating but he did a fantastic job explaining the warranties, coverage, and pricing in a way that made it easy to understand. If I could give more than 5 stars I would! I will definitely be sending my friends and family to this dealership or any John Eagle dealership for that matter when they are in need of a vehicle! Thank you thank you thank you!!",5.0
21,"June 11, 2018","We recently went through John Eagle Honda to purchase a new CR-V.  Our sales person was Keith Thomas and he was fantastic.  He's a no pressure kind of guy, very straight forward and very caring about his customers.  When we settled on a price there were no ""surprise"" additions.  He gave us exactly what we wanted and more.  If I could give him ten stars I would.  We'll be back when we get our next Honda and Keith will be the one we work with.",5.0
22,"April 28, 2018","Walter Boyd is a fantastic representative for John Eagle Honda.  He was very attentive, quick to respond to email, and had all the answers to my mother's questions when she was in the dealership ""just looking"" for a new car.  Mom is usually an alert, quick minded woman of 92 who still drives, but while slight illness caused slow thinking on shopping day.  Walter was exceptionally patient and understanding; he treated her like family.  He stayed with her while trying out almost all the car styles on the show room floor and at least 3 from the outside parking areas.  It was a very positive experience and in the end, Mom purchased a new Accord and left very happy with her time there.  She said ""I'm really glad we had Walter as my sales person.  He was very good and I appreciated his warm, friendly professionalism.  (Note:  The only complaint was the pressure in the finance office to buy the extended warranty.)  A fair price for the 2018 car was offered.",4.8
23,"April 22, 2018","We were very pleased with the upfront pricing which closely matched the price from both Consumer Reports and TruCar. Evans had a very thorough understanding of every detail and feature of our new car. Sitting with the finance folks is always where I have felt the most pressure, with that said we got our car and the interest rate that we had been planning on.   

Once we got the car home my wife found some spots on the headliner near the door pillars and I reported those back to the dealer. Hoping to get them cleaned up when we pick up our new plates shortly",4.4
24,"April 16, 2018","I purchased a CRV from Cameron Huestis last week, and it was the best experience I've ever had buying a car. I knew what I wanted when I got to the dealership and I was out of there in my new car within 2 hours in a price that I was thrilled with. Both he and the Asst. Finance Director, Danny, provided excellent service so I'd definitely recommend John Eagle for anyone looking to buy a car. ",4.8
25,"April 11, 2018","Worked with Zane Pruett at John Eagle Honda and got a great deal, there was a slight problem on our end but they worked with us and Zane even came in on a Sunday to hand over the keys for the car and made sure everything was okay! Great guy! The car was perfect, the people were great. I recommend you look for him if you want a great, smooth experience buying a car.",5.0
26,"April 10, 2018","I recently purchased a Honda Accord from Cameron Huestis, and believe it or not, it was actually a ""fun"" experience because of his knowledge, humor and relaxed demeanor. I described to him what I was looking for and he immediately showed me several excellent options that fit my search to a ""T"". I have never had such a great time and excellent salesman when purchasing a car in my life!!! If you are looking to buy a vehicle, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND that you visit John Eagle Honda and request Cameron Huestis as your salesman. You can also call ahead of time and schedule an appointment with him. P.S. I absolutely love this car and will never buy another brand. This young man knows his stuff, yet he is not pushy - it's refreshing to find an honest, caring salesman these days.",5.0
27,"March 30, 2018","I have not used the service center yet! I would definitely recommend John Eagle Honda to anyone looking to purchase their next vehicle!

I appreciate the service I received at John Eagle Honda, and I will certainly be back next time I need another vehicle!",5.0
28,"March 28, 2018","We started the deal over the telephone with a very happy ending in a couple of day. We already know the Honda model we wanted and Justino Morales, and his sales manager Heath Dixon,  put together an very reasonable offer with all the accessories, and even more, that we were looking for. Promptly clarified all our questions and let us feel very comfortable through the purchasing process. We will definitively go back to John Eagle Honda of Houston for our next car acquisition. ",5.0
29,"March 09, 2018","I went to Gillman first and had a horrible experience - I felt hustled, pressured, and when I chose to walk I had to ask for my trade-in back seven times before they gave it back to me. Seven. Totally different experience at John Eagle. They were friendly, helpful, gave excellent all-around customer service and didn't for even a second make me feel rushed and hustled. It sounds silly, but while I was signing my paperwork I was given 3 bottles of water in addition to what I was offered when I arrived; at the other dealer I was there for 4.5 hours and never even offered 1, so those water bottles became very symbolic of my entire car-buying experience. Bottom line: John Eagle is the way to go if you want to be treated like a human and not a number.",5.0
30,"March 06, 2018","By far the BEST car buying experience my husband and I have ever had! From the moment we got there everyone we came into contact with was warm and friendly. Even folks that were not dealing with us at all smiled and offered a Good Morning to us. We were greeted by Justino when we arrived there he was lovely to work with. He listened to our wants and needs and wasted no time pulling around a car for us to look at so we didn't have to wonder the lot. He was very knowledgeable about the features and details with each one we looked at. He made it personal by joking and adding in some information about his own life and family! It was a great experience, no pressure at all. We felt as though we were dealing with a friend. He didn't just stand there as we looked around in the car, he was in there with us showing us all the exciting things it had to offer, he was pulling out seats and reclining the chairs. He was very hands on!! And did everything to get us exactly what we were looking for at the price we could afford.  After our time with Justino we had decided to move forward with the purchase. And from then on the experience continued to improve even more which was shocking to both my husband and I considering in the past this is the part that we really dread.. the HARD sell. but nope. It was amazing. We had the pleasure of dealing with Mr. Matthews to finalize the sale of our car and he was equally amazing. He did everything in his power to get us the price we could afford with the protection we wanted. And again... it was personal.. no robots. Buying from John Eagle Honda of Houston is the best choice we've made since moving to Houston. I cannot recommend them highly enough! 

Sincerely,
Proud new Odyssey owner",5.0
31,"February 26, 2018","Jose Cruz, Abel Sixtos and Xavier Vargas helped get us into the car we wanted and never tried to steer us away or into something we didn't want. No pressure at all. After a really bad experience at another Honda dealership ended up getting to John Eagle late on Friday saw some cars and test drove them and Jose was able to make the experience great and even told us to go home sleep on it. Next morning came out with our brand new Honda Pilot. We want to send many thanks to everyone at John Eagle Honda of Houston from the Padilla Family. Thank You!!!",5.0

34,"January 23, 2018","My experience with John Eagle Honda was outstanding. Jamal Morrison in sales was excellent and Leonta and Abel in finance as well as Louis in Service were all great. 

I priced my 2017 Pilot EX-L with most of the dealers in the Houston area and John Eagle matched my best price. As a customer of John Eagle Acura, I wanted to deal with them if possible.

Due to a hospitalization of a family member, my wife was unable to come to the dealer to sign the forms, so they allowed me to take the forms to her and have her sign them (I offered to FaceTime her doing this) and then let me return the forms to the dealer. This was so helpful.

I've seen the comments on Yelp about the bait and switch as well as the tactics of the finance department. I experienced none of this. For those of you who have, or are concerned you might, let me make the following suggestions:

1. Do your homework! You can get bids from other dealers in the area; play them off against each other and buy where you feel the most comfortable. I chose to drive past one Honda dealer that is closer to my home because of the treatment I receive from John Eagle Honda (and Acura). 
2. Know the pricing. Sites like Edmunds, Piloteers.org, and TrueCar can give you what people are paying for the model you are seeking. Knowledge is power. Also, always, always, get the 'out the door price'. This makes them show all the add ons (and gives you the ability to have them removed) before you get to finance. 
3. Don't tell them you have a trade until you have a firm, out the door price on the car. Showing the trade at the start muddies the water, because you don't know how much you're paying for the car or how much you're getting for your trade. In my case, it just keeps it simple, because I know what I am paying for the car first, then I know roughly what the value of my trade is, so it is clear. I would suggest you get a bid from CarMax on what they will give you for your car before you begin to shop. 
4. Have your financing lined up BEFORE you go to the dealer. This gives you leverage; if they can match it, so be it. If not you are lined up with your financing. If you want to use Honda Financing, you can get preapproved from Honda before you go to the dealership, including the rate. This takes away the ability for you to be manipulated. Control the dialog yourself. I used my credit union and it was painless. I wrote them a personal check after they spoke with my credit union on how to title the car and verified the funds would be put in my account. 
5. Be very clear on what you want as options, especially in finance. In my case I don't need credit life, accident, or add ons. Honda has bumper to bumper coverage for 3 years 36,000 miles. You can add HondaCare anytime before that time frame is up. I had prices of what I would consider, from other online dealers while there, so I controlled that dialog. While I am sure most dealers would disagree with me, I wouldn't purchase any extended warranty that isn't issued by the manufacturer. Thus, if I am in Cleveland, Texas or Cleveland, Ohio, if I have an issue, I go to the nearest Honda dealer. 
6. Accessories. I wanted the roof rails added to my Pilot, as they are not standard with the EX-L. I had pricing of what I could get the rails for online, so when they gave me the 'retail price' I showed them my quote for the same part. At first they gave me a price for the installation of the rails I would buy online. Right before we closed the deal, they lowered the price substantially including the installation, which kept me from the hassle of having to order them, have them shipped, etc. Again, knowledge is power. 
7. Be polite, but firm. ""No"" is your friend. 

By doing these things in advance, I controlled the dialog with sales and finance. As Coach Bear Bryant used to say ""Prior Preparation Prevents Poor Performance"". 

Thus, my experience was outstanding and I highly recommend John Eagle Honda. 

Good luck!

35,"January 09, 2018","We purchased a 2011 Honda Odyssey from John Eagle Honda in March 2015.  It came with an extended warranty.  The van only had 40,000 miles on it.  It has been in the shop 5 times of the last 3 years and warranty has denied every claim.  Now, we have an issue with he vinyl leather inside the van and their ""warranty"" on that is saying thats not veered either.  Mind you, the vinyl warranty is some coating they put on their used vehicle and they charge you for it when you buy a used vehicle.  Called and left messages for service advisors and no one called me back.  Had to call back multiple times.  Overall, the experience we have had with them has been less than mediocre.  Avoid them and their schemes if you can.  ",1.6
36,"December 18, 2017","This past Saturday I was blessed to have received the most incredible service at John Eagle Honda of Houston. We were greeted right away from our Salesman, Shawn Allan, who turned out to be nothing short of great. He took into consideration everything I was looking for in a car, and he found me the perfect fit. He never hesitated to hear my needs, he didn’t get frustrated and he stayed patient throughout the process. When it was time to move into financing, we were then greeted my Manny Gil, who was our business/ fianance manager. He was very professional and answered any questions we had. We explained our dissatisfaction that we had experienced at Honda of Spring just the week prior, and he made sure that we didn’t get that same service at John Eagle. Overall, I’m truly happy. I’ll definitely suggest John Eagle to friends and family, and I’m more than sure that I’ll be returning back in the future. ",5.0

39,"December 04, 2017","Nothing will ever compare to the experiences I have had with the John Eagle family of dealerships.  John Eagle Honda in Houston is no exception.  As we all know, Honda's sell themselves so this is solely on their impeccable customer service.  I was treated so well.  The sales staff is professional without losing a warm hospitable presence.  The finance department was very fair and easy to work with.  I probably won't be in the market for a new car any time soon since I purchases a brand new one and Honda's last forever but I will be sending anyone I know their way.  I highly recommend them for your car buying needs.",5.0

I informed him of my wants, and after showing me a few I ended up settling with an even better car than I had hoped for. He was well informed on all the cars and was completely capable of explaining any questions regarding those cars. Although he was busy he still patiently took care of us, performed a test drive and helped me settle on a car I liked! We then set up an appointment for the following day to come in and make the deal. Justino was an excellent salesman who took care of my car buying experience better than anyone else. He didn’t just try selling me a car and telling me what I wanted to hear, he told the truth and truly wanted me to have a car I would enjoy. Definitely will be recommending family and friends to Justino!",5.0

Although we figured that the pilot would not be ready until the next day we received a call around 2PM to pick up our new pilot. We drove down to John Eagle Honda to pick it up.

Allyne McBride's focus on customer service and satisfaction of our wishes including the design, scheduling, loaner car availability (after Hurricane Harvey) and scheduling the paint vendor, to the return of our vehicle ahead of schedule were professional, timely, and correct. Something that is difficult to do for a disabled customer in pain. We were pleasantly surprised, relieved, and appreciative of his Quality of Care. Thank you, Allyne!

57,"October 12, 2017","Absolute best experience buying a car all due to one man, Justino Morales. He was the BEST car salesman we have ever encountered. He was incredibly professional. We came days ago to view a specific car, which was not at the lot that day. He did try to push other cars on us, he offered to contact us as soon as it returned to the lot from being detailed. As soon as the car hit the lot, he contacted us and we headed towards the dealership. He at no point tried to run our credit or pull anything out of us. He was realistic in the sense that if we said we wanted something (including price point) he worked his hardest to get it for us. One piece of advice I would give is to know your credit, know what you can get interest wise, and push for it. Because it is simply the dealerships job to try to get a higher interest rate out of you (not the salesman's fault). Other than having to work for the interest rate, every thing positive happened. Great experience. ",5.0

My previous automobile buying experiences at other dealerships have been absolute torture.  Often I have told family and friends I would rather experience a root canal without anesthesia than endure aggravation of the back and forth negotiating process typically associated with buying a new car.  I have always maintained a dealership is entitled to make a reasonable profit--just not all of their daily profit at my expense.

Mr. Sixtos the, Mr. Matthews, and the John Eagle team have changed my mind.  The price you quoted was the most competitive among local dealerships.  The vehicle was ready when we arrived.  The car was detailed and ready to go!  And your concern about our satisfaction was genuine.  

The John Eagle Honda team has the right formula...please do not change anything!  You have set the standard by which we shall forever judge automobile dealerships.

94,"July 13, 2017","This dealership uses low online prices as a tactic to get potential car buyers in the door. They are very proud of their competitive prices. But it is just a ploy. They pad their fees so much that there is nothing competitive about their prices. If you are a well informed consumer, you will see through their games immediately. Their salesmen are fast talking and try to move the process along leaving little space to ask questions. As soon as we walked through the door, I was immediately asked for my license for the test drive. After the test drive, Walter began the paperwork before we began discussing price. I had to interrupt him to tell him my intentions. After he told me the drive out price and me telling him I would not pay that, he went to the back for a long time. Another shallow tactic we easily saw through (should have got up and left right there and then). He came back and said he ""miscalculated"" the licensing fee and the price dropped $200. Another tactic, I was unimpressed. He began talking in circles about emails I clearly and repeatedly told him I did not see, how they get competitive prices, all things irrelevant to our questions. We asked for an itemized list of the costs. I wanted to know how much taxes, title, tags, documentation fees each would be individually. But they didn't want to show us because it would expose the $1500 extra they were trying to charge us. We had to get up and leave in the middle of the guy talking!

103,"April 27, 2017","Everything went great for us until we got to the financing part. The finance guy, George, gave us a huge run around filled with nothing but half-truths and outright lies in an attempt to convince us that Honda's bumper to bumper warranty is somehow applicable only to the initial 12months or 12,000 miles of service, after which bumper to bumper is reduced down to manufacturer defect. In reality, the only thing covered in the vehicles initial 12 months that expires after that is wheel alignment. 

Every time we asked George a question about the extended warranty's cost, he refused to answer directly and goes back to monthly payments. When pressed, he told us that it would cost $600 after he fudges around with financing, which turned out to be on an 18% APR that he also refused to disclose. We could have financed it through a third party on our own for around 2%! 

Throughout the ordeal, George never gave us a clear answer on the total loan amount, the APR, or the extended warranty he was so desperately pushing on to us. Like clockwork, every time we asked him anything related to the actual terms of the loan, ranging from principal to APR, to cost with and without the supposedly miraculous extended warranty, George ALWAYS went back to monthly payment amount. When I asked him why he isn't answering our questions, he blamed US for misleading him into thinking that we care more about monthly payment, which is an outright lie since we repeatedly asked him for the net cost and terms of loan. He then said that 90% of customers care about payment rather than loan, which is completely irrelevant since we weren't asking ANY question about monthly payment.

Finally, when we got upset over his dishonesty, he threw his paper pad on the desk and wrote the loan amount with and without the warranty. Turns out, what he told us would've cost $600 is actually $1600. To add insult to injury, he then asked us to sign an affidavit that we turned down his offer for $1,100, which was again an outright lie. When I clarified this point, he had the audacity to ask us if we would do it for $1,100.

Totally unacceptable experience. Shady and aggressive sales tactics have moved from the stereotypical used car salesman to thieving finance salesman.

The salesman, Keith, was absolutely phenomenal and should serve as an exemplary employee. The finance guy, George, needs to start giving answers to questions he was asked rather than answers he wants to give to sell warranties. You are a finance guy. You facilitate the sale. Do your job.

After the second car I bought there was paid off, John Eagle Honda was notified on January 17th 2017 to process a refund check of $246.93 for GAP insurance which was purchased with the vehicle. According to the law that is their responsibility and I thought it will be done in a timely manner.
Being aware that there will be some processing time I didn’t inquire about it, but after a few weeks I called to check on the status of refund check. And that is where the fun starts. Most of the time it is very hard to get any of financial guys to answer and I left messages.  A lot of them, but no call back.
After I used their online portal and sent an email, one of the guys called (I think his name was Adam) to lecture me it could take up to one month to process the check. 
Waiting again for more than a month and then went to the dealership a week or more ago.
Spoke to one of financial guys (I think Many) and he checks the paperwork and it is a miracle. The check was cut that morning and I should receive it shortly.
Not a word from him when I said you guys lost a loyal customer because of a couple of hundreds of dollars or an apology.
Working in customer service for over 20 years I had seen it all but this is the top of the top. I can’t comprehend it; it just does not make any sense.

 Besides, the manager(Jeff Koch) told me that when I called them back to say I wanted the car, He would ""pull the keys"".

115,"January 02, 2017","I had been shopping around for a used car for several weeks, I had already visited several dealers from different brands, when I decided to give John Eagle Honda a try. I had seen good reviews about Justino Morales so I asked for him when I visited the dealership. 

Before starting I told him that I had a list of vehicles that I was interested in, but I was no buying that day, regardless of how good the offer was, I only wanted to see them and perhaps do some driving tests. I also mentioned him that I was looking for a non-pressure experience, so if he could respect it then we could move forward.

Fortunately we were able to work together and the experience was pleasant, he was always patient and willing to do the driving tests, and there was no pressure at all.

I bought my car in August 2016 and I would definitely buy from them again, so if you visit John Eagle Honda you might want to ask for Justino, he's by far the best salesman that I dealt with. He's polite and professional and made me feel the shopping experience comfortable and easy.",4.8

By selling you a car from his dealership, he will be doing you a favor; feel honored. Historical ratings have been extremely positive for this dealership and they use that to their advantage to tell you that 'they are the best'.

142,"July 11, 2016","I was here to buy my second car for my wife. Justino explained all the things perfectly and got my desired rate from Babar Salman .

This is my initial review as soon as I  left the showroom with my car. Now I want to talk about the issue that I am facing with John eagle Honda.  I purchased the car for 15744, with a down payment of 8000 dollars. The reaming amount should be my loan amount that is around 7744$. I got  my loan approved through John eagle from Bank of America. Day before yesterday I was checking my Bank of America loan details and it say that I own 12328$. That is around 5000$+ more than my loan amount. I am trying to get in touch with the finance person ""Salman Babar"" since yesterday. Left four  messages to his voice mail. He picks up and say I will call back in ten minutes and never gets back. Be aware of this when dealing with John Eagle Honda. Until you buy the vehicle, they keep on calling you but never are going to get back once you buy the car. 

Update on the discrepancy .

I had to personally walk in to the show room to get all my questions answered. The finance person ""Salman Babar"" had  made me sign all the coverage worth  5200$  on 15744 $ car. He said that I  literally I agreed to all this he had told the price  and he has video recording to prove. I confronted him to bring the video recording and show a single instance where he told me the coverage price. 

A 15744$ + 5200(coverage) =20944 $. There is brand new car in the show room for this price. why the xxxx I would buy a two year old used car with all the coverage.? Now I have to go through the process and cancelling all coverage my self. They are not going to do anything. One of coverage there is no process mentioned to cancel.

Please look at every penny before you sign the paper.? Be aware of this dealer.",2.0

Price looks competitive for Honda Certified cars in Houston area, but you might be able to get it cheaper somewhere else if you don't need Honda Certified car.

However, I could not take the car to them as I needed to get the tire fixed right away. So I got it fixed locally in Sugar Land and got in touch with John Eagle. Mike Ma was my service advisor. He gave me an appointment on a Friday at 10 AM.  He sent me a message to remind me of the appointment about 24 hours ahead. At the service center, he took my car and within minutes came back to advise me that the battery was bad and is covered under warranty. He got the oil change done in addition to replacing the tires and battery all within the hour. Mike was very cordial, thorough  and professional. I am of the opinion that he does not leave anything to chance and is thorough in checking the vehicle in all aspects to ensure that everything is in top condition when he returns the vehicle to the customer.

177,"October 11, 2015","I had to bring my CRV back in to have the AC repaired again.  During the last visit, the dealership proposed a more inexpensive fix for the AC.   Unfortunately, the fix didn't last.  Although the repair didn't work long-term, I appreciated the approach to minimizing cost.

During this visit, the service consultant, Allyne McBride,  kept me informed of the needed repairs and was able to apply the cost of the last visit to this major repair.  This saved me close to $600.

Great service, great communication.  Everything was done on time and at the proposed price.  Allyne did a great job making sure everything was to my liking.  Top notch Service Consultant.

Just another great visit to John Eagle Honda Service Center.",5.0
178,"October 11, 2015","They didn't match the price they said they would and after negotiations that should not have been necessary, when we got the car home, the trunk tray, which was in the car during our final walk thru the night before, was not there.  When we called they said it wasn't included in the final price yet everything else said it was.  We may take our car for service there, but will never buy a car there again.  We bought our first Honda from a dealer further away.  We'll go back there next time.

179,"October 10, 2015","I bought my daughter a new Honda in May of 2015 from John Eagle Honda  and was lucky enough to get Ali Shahid to help us with the sale. Ive had no issues with the car but have had excellent service in many different areas with Mr Ali. You just cant find good people like this guy anymore, just willing to go above and beyond the normal expectations of a person in the car business these days. He really puts meaning back into the phrase ""service after the sale"". So if your looking for a new or used Honda don't waist your time looking and hoping you get a better experience, deal or service after the sale anywhere else just go to John Eagle Honda and ask for Ali Shahid and make your buying experience one to brag to all of your friends and family about.

Our salesman was Ali and he made this the best buying experience I've had in the 34 years I've been buying cars!  He explained the features of the car, had a great sense of humor and wasn't the aggressive, high-pressure types I've had in the past.

205,"July 27, 2015","This was my first time buying a car. I was originally set on a Toyota RAV4 but after spending hours at 4 Toyota dealerships only to leave feeling frustrated and uncomfortable, I decided to explore other options. I researched the Honda HRV online and fell in love. I visited John Eagle on a Saturday and was greeted by the Sales Manager Dean who introduced me to a sales rep named Ralph. I explained that I was interested in the HRV and he never tried to steer me in another direction. Ralph gave me a very detailed ""tour"" of the HRV, something I didn't have at Toyota. When it came time to talk numbers, he gave me a very fair, honest price and answered all of my ""first time buyer"" questions. Another thing I really liked was the Eagle Edge package that comes with all purchases-- they really care to help you after you drive off the lot. 

After visiting all of the Toyota dealers, I hated everything about the car buying process but Ralph turned that around for me. I've been loyal to Toyota for almost 10 years but I'm proud to be a part of the Honda family now.

   I also appreciate that the dealership will service my car. I don't have any sort of rapport with any of my local shops, so I see this as a great opportunity to begin a more personal service experience. From day one, John Eagle Honda will take care of my car, from oil changes to flat tires to a/c. It makes it easy for me, who admittedly is a little bit afraid of being jipped on car repairs.

Zane made me feel really comfortable- In other words, I didn't feel like a girl walking into a car repair shop where all of the men will think they can get you for all of the money you are worth. It was an extremely pleasant experience. Last night I stopped by since I was ready to buy and unfortunately Zane was helping another customer, but Ali Shahid was able to assist me in my car buying experience. Ali really helped ease my worries regarding financing and secured my car purchase decision with his ability to lighten the mood, crack a couple of jokes, and thoroughly take care of his customer.

234,"December 27, 2014","My car buying experience with John Eagle Honda was amazing.  From the minute I walked in to the dealership I was treated like I mattered.  I knew that I had found the place I wanted to buy my car from.   Before heading to the dealership, I used the online trade-in calculator to find out roughly what my car value was going to be and they honored it! They also had the car in stock that was advertised on their website as well the same model in other colors and they were ready when I arrived at the dealership for my appointment.  My salesman, Clayton, was very patient and did not pressure me at all.  I also met the General Sales Manager who welcomed me, and in between negotiations, the Sales Manager saw me sitting alone and introduced himself.  I could tell he cared about the customers.  Working with Elhadji Toure, in Finance, sealed the deal!  He was professional and a genuinely great guy.  I left the dealership so happy with my new car.  I would recommend John Eagle Honda to anyone who is planning on buying a car.",5.0
235,"December 24, 2014","One of my best car buying experience with Aramis Mejia, sales consultant at John  Eagle Honda. Bought a Honda Accord EXL V6 and it was a bit late in the evening when we reached the showroom. By the time we drove out it was well past 10pm, but not one minute I felt rushed out by the sales staff or by the finance dept. The follow up call with Aramis also was outstanding. He walked me through every detail of the car, without assuming anything that i would know.
During the price negotiation, he was very polite, unlike some other dealers that I have experienced who get frustrated, if they cannot meet your target price. He worked through the costing in detail and although initially he did not disclose the interest rate, but promised it would be lower than the estimate, and it turned out much lower.
All in all it was a good experience, will recommend to others and will go back to them.

236,"December 18, 2014","I did some online research and was dealing with few dealers in Houston area. 
Matt Patterson of John Eagle stood out with his prompt responses and friendly behavior. Once I visited the dealership Matt was very courteous and helpful in explaining me everything and also he gave me great deal.
I would also like to mention the Finance Manager - Elhadji Toure.
Elhadji was very patient and helpful during the entire documentation process and explained me what is what.

Overall it was a great experience at John Eagle and the entire staff is very welcoming that you will feel at home. Also, everyone is willing to get your business and everything is non-rushed.

So if you are looking at great customer service, awesome people, good deals - John Eagle is the place.

Once again, thanks a lot Matt for making my first Honda buying experience so great.

237,"December 17, 2014","We had an absolutely great experience from all aspects of John Eagle Honda. The salesman (Matt Patterson) and online sales process were far better than the other Houston dealers.  We started our buying process with their online web chat, then progressed to email, and visited the dealership to sign the paperwork and pickup the car.  We had consistent communication and honesty throughout the process without any high pressure sales tactics.

Once we finished the sales process we moved over to service and we were met with the same excellent communication and service.  

You have done a great job building a team focused on customer service. Thank you!

I am really grateful to Ali for his hospitality and help. The financial assistant (His name is Jeff if I'm not mistaken) was very professional himself  and very informational about the finance of the car so many thanks to him too.

250,"August 26, 2014","I went to John Eagle Honda on 08-09-14 to have my AC repaired. After the initial inspection, the expansion valve needed to be replaced and I went with the recommended replacement of the evaporator as well, (an up-sell), but with the Texas heat I went for it. Summing up my experience are as follows:

Pro

Parts (Expansion Valve & Evaporator) were discounted to competitively match what other dealers were offering. They were charging me list price on these parts and I could have easily ordered them from Majestic Honda at 30% off. They agreed to give me a 25% discount. (Note: Including the shipping and handling charges Majestic Honda would still have been cheaper). 

Cons

Inaccurate information on when parts were arriving - This is when I got a call on Tuesday, 08-19-14. Dave Johnson, my service representative, informed me that the car was finally ready however there were minor parts that needed to be installed and that it would be received the next day. Upon arrival on Wednesday, I was told that the parts were not there and I have to come back another time. No consideration was placed on my time and the distance I have to travel for the remaining parts. 

Inaccurate billing - Aside from the Expansion Valve & Evaporator there were additional parts added to the invoice at 45% OVER list price. In addition, all of which are suspect to being mishandled, leading to it breaking or misplaced.
After going back to the dealer yet again on 08-26-14, the mechanic admitted that a few parts were lost and so I was refunded those parts. This was after much argument with my service representative and him accusing me of trying to get stuff for free. Another thing to note was I trusted my service representative, Dave Johnson, knew his math as he calculated the refund. Once I got to the office and began to put the invoice away, I noted his numbers did not add up. I had to call back to have the additional amount credited back.

Deep Scratches on the firewall and bent access hole - The expansion valve has a cover which comes in two pieces and is held together by locking push tabs. Instead of pushing the locking tabs to release the cover it is very apparent that it was pried off the firewall using a flat head screwdriver which lead to deep scratches on the firewall, bending the lip of the access hole and breaking the part. 

Broken turn signal - Leaving the dealership, I directly proceeded to work. Upon arrival I then noticed that the passenger side turn signal was hanging from just its wires. It appears during work was performed it had been accidentally knocked off. In the process, one of the retaining tabs broke. It seem to appear that it was returned to its place with the intent to conceal the damage until I drove out of the lot. Without the retaining tab the light easily worked itself out of its place from wind and road vibration. I ended up ordering this part online. 

To sum up my experience, I am quite displeased with the service I got especially with my service representative, Dave Johnson. I truly wished that our conversations were recorded as he flat out lied. He aims to please and would say things that are untrue. Second, the notion of taking pride of your work is most certainly absent. The scratches on the engine bay shows the lack of care. Lastly, the burden was place on me to scrutinize the invoice/bill. Aren't we customers owed a fair and accurate billing?",2.0

It is not convenient, but I continue to make the trek because I honor the cheerful professionalism, and expert counsel and respect that has always been extended to me and to my wife.  We have purchased or leased at least 5 vehicles from John Eagle.  I always have my Hondas serviced at John Eagle.  I appreciate that all estimates are exact; and if there appears, upon closer inspection, any additional need then I am informed and involved in the discussion, then I can decide whether or not to incur any extra expense to fix it.  I am treated respectfully and warmly.  A recent case in point, a year or so ago I leased a Honda FIT.  My sales team (Jean Jean and Alan) made the process a breeze.  I really surprised myself in how much I love this car.  I'm 6' 5"" tall, so I find it a continual source of personal amusement that I fit comfortably in my FIT.  I've really LOVED it.  A few weeks ago, Jean Jean called me to say he thought it possible for me to trade in my FIT for the newest model and still save me money.  I made the appointment, not so much because I thought it was even possible to improve upon my current deal - with a car that I was completely happy with - but I knew John Eagle Honda has always valued my time.  So, what the heck.  True to his word, Jean Jean put me into a brand new FIT - exactly matching every aspect of my current car - with only one exception: the terms of THIS lease saved me approximately $3,000 over the other lease.  Jean Jean is a joy to work with - buoyantly friendly.  I also greatly value Bryant Sharp, general sales manager.  Bryant had helped my wife and I years before when he was in the finance department.

The overall price of the new car was around $1500 above the kbb.com average fair price and the trade in was $2500 below kbb.com. The negotiation ended when the sales manager started to argue that I want retail on my car and wholesale on the new one. My old van was purchased at this dealer and the attitude of the salesman and managers at that time were much more reasonable and I was relatively happy with my purchase, it was much closer to the kbb estimates in terms of trade in and purchase price, and the whole process was a lot faster.

I told him I was interested in looking at the Fit, he pointed out one in the showroom and told me a salesperson would be with me shortly. I was quickly approached by another person who talked with me for a few minutes, but disappeared when I asked how to open the back of the Fit. Then a third person came and explained that the ones in the showroom would not open, but I could look at them on the lot. He pointed me in the general direction of the Fits on the lot and told me to find him if I had any questions. 

As I was looking, the first person caught up with me. I explained I wanted to test drive and he took me back to the showroom to set it up. They required copies of my insurance and DL which was okay, but I also had to answer a  ton of questions about payments and other things. Then he walked in and out of the showroom a few timed before pulling the car up. He seemed nervous and that made me uncomfortable. He had a preplanned out route he wanted me to take and he did not want me to take it on the freeway. As I was driving he was ordering me to turn here, stop there, and slow down. I wasn't speeding, I was very aware that the car is not mine and driving carefully. 

We went back to the showroom after I demanded to be able to take it on the freeway. I asked him a few questions about things such as the lack of power and why the air would get hot when I accelerated. He told me it was due to the small engine and anything in my range would probably do the same thing. At this point I asked for some number estimates based on the information I had already given them. I went inside and the third person showed up again. He told me he could not give me estimates without running my credit and to let them know if I wanted to buy and they would get me what I needed.

279,"November 01, 2012","   Getting service done on your car is NEVER fun. I own an 05 Civic Hybrid in which the IMA battery went out on, which costs about $3000 to replace. I don't make much money teaching preschool full time and am only paid monthly rather than weekly or biweekly, and I also am a full time college student. 
   I originally brought my car in for the 100000 mile service, which is when they found that the IMA battery was bad which causes the engine light to stay on so I was not able to pass my inspection which was due.
   The Service Advisor, Roger Hickey, that worked with me through all of this was awesome. He helped out so much and made this whole ordeal so much easier. When I took the car in for the regular service, I was given a FREE rental, which Mr. Hickey allowed me (with no problem) to keep for a few extra days because my very busy schedule left me with no time to go drop it off and pick up my own car. He also informed me that Honda would cover half of the charges for the IMA battery since it went out a little sooner than it should have, but unfortunatly even though this helped out tremendously, I still would not be able to afford it for another month.
Mr. Hickey stayed in touch with me and kept the deal going with Honda until I could afford to get the battery replaced. Finally when that time came, I again was given a free rental with navigation and an ez tag which was nice. Well, turns out that the O2 sensor had also crapped out, which would normally cost another $600! Mr. Hickey informed me of this, and that he couldn't let me pay for that after everything I had already gone through so he got the price of the sensor cut in half as well and removed the labor charges, dropping it to about $170. Everything turned out great! I came back a few days later for the inspection and all is well! And as an added bonus they wash my car EVERY time I bring it in (even when I had just been there 2 days before) AND Mr. Hickey let me know that I can bring my car in ANYTIME it needs a wash for FREE! 
   Like I said, it's never something we look forward to, but they definitely made it the best experience that it could've been.

Once I arrived at the dealership with my wife, we were showed the CRV we wanted to purchase and I noticed there were all these dealer add on options I did not want.  I do take issue with their entire sales process where they tack on needless dealer 'add ons' like nitrogen filled tires for $150 and scotchgarding for $300. Zach Smith came out and said I was given an incorrect drive out price by the other dealer, that they were giving me a fake price they couldn't match.

We went out without buying it but we left our number and contact just in case. Next morning I received 3 calls on the cellphone and my wife other 3 and finally they told me my the price I offered was fair. It was early afternoon, I asked them to clean the car and I quickly left work to go there (like 2 hour on highway). Once there, I SIGNED the purcase offer in front of the sales man and I was waiting for my car with the money in my hand. In the meanwhile, other guys entered the store and since the were interested in the same car (but with financing, not cash, so I think they were supposed to buy at higher price), a manager rudly asked me to wait since it was not so sure I could take the car anymore.The salesman in th meanwhile was really surprisd about this and just told me he can't do anything. I watched those guys deal, test the car (that I already tested on saturday) and finally be credit approved. The manager waste my purchase offer and sold the car to the other guys, all of this asking me to wait 1 hour and taking time every time I was asking him news while my baby and my wife were ther with me.

333,"May 17, 2011","Clevester was referred to me by a close friend who has bought several vehicles from him.  My friend promised me I'd never visit another dealership after working with Clevester, and they were absolutely right.  I was in a time crunch to find a vehicle due to a motor vehicle accident that totalled my primary car, but Clevester helped make the situation a lot less stressful by operating without the typical high pressure sales tactics.  He kept things slow and casual, at the speed *I* was comfortable with, and never pushed me to make a decision I wasn't yet comfortable with.  I visited the lot THREE TIMES before I made a final decision, and even then, I didn't make a purchase until my previous vehicle claim had been settled. Clevester was supportive throughout the entire process and expressed empathy for my anxieties and concerns regarding claims, loans, costs, etc.  Clevester was very knowledgeable about all the models I looked at, and I test drove two vehicles (the Fit and the Accord), and at Clevester's suggestion, also test drove the Civic.  Even though I really liked the more expensive Accord, Clevester helped me keep an open mind regarding the Civic, just in case I wasn't comfortable with the higher price tag of the Accord.  Boy was I surprised not to be pressured into a more expensive vehicle!  I finally settled on the Honda Accord (which I'm still in love with 2 years later).  I was able to negotiate a great price for my new vehicle, even though I had to deal with more than 30 minutes of the usual back and forth and waiting from the floor manager, who incidentally made rather snotty written remarks with each offer in what I can only assume was an attempt to make me feel guilty for haggling.  It was easy not to react to his childish tactics, because I knew what I wanted and the maximum amount I was willing to spend, and I was perfectly willing to go elsewhere if I didn't get the deal I wanted.  Clevester was very understanding during this process, and frankly seemed a little irritated by the manager's attitude.  After nailing down a final price, I was even able find a better interest rate on my loan through Honda Financial then the ones I had gotten from both my bank AND my credit union!

Since my purchase, I've visited with the lot with friends and made several referrals, and nearly EVERYONE purchased from this dealer with similarly good experiences.  Given that the first several oil changes are free, I've also gotten into the habit of doing all my vehicle maintenance through the dealership, something I've never done before.  With all the coupons I receive in the mail, the cost really isn't significantly more than the road-side ""Jiffy-Lubes"", and the service is SO much better!  Everyone is very friendly and recognizes their regular customers, and the lounge area has good wi-fi and a nice snack area.  On top of the free carwash with each service, I also really appreciate the option of scheduling my appointments online.  You know, so when I remember I need an oil change at 1AM?  ;)",5.0

337,"January 02, 2011","Stopped into the dealership on a whim, and liked the Crosstour. There was no pressure whatsoever to test drive, purchase, leave a contact number or anything.  We simply advised them that we would think about it and get back to them as we did not have to purchase a car at this time.  A couple of days later, we decided to test drive the Crosstour and went back into the dealership.  I sought our sales person from the previous visit, however; he was busy with a customer adn immediately got Eric Roberson to assist us with the drive.  We explained that we had narrowed down our search of potential vehicles and wanted to see how the Crosstour drove.  Again, there was absolutely no sales pressure at all!!!!!  Once we completed the test drive, Eric and I exchamged information and I explained to him that we still had a couple of other vehicles to test drive, and I would get back with him.  After completing the other test drives, I purchased a COnsumer Reports New Car Report on this vehicle as well as the other we had narrowed our selcetion process down to.  In addition, I also purchased the COnsumer Reports Value Report of trading our car into a dealer so that I would have as much information as possible to make an informed purchasing decision on a new car.  I assured Eric that I would come back to him with whatever information I had as far as pricing and quotes from other dealers in town and give him the last opportunity of securing a deal; I was that pleased with his level of professionalism and courtesy!!!!!  I truly truly wanted to shop around and subsequently complete a deal with him, as I felt he certainly deserved the sale.  I phoned Eric last night around 6pm and asked to come in and meet with him to see if we could reach an agreement based upon the various quotes that I received from other dealers in town.  While I was hopeful of getting a deal done, I have to say; after spending 2.5 hours at the dealership, presenting all of the pricinted quotes and information, along with the Consumer Reports New Car Reports and Used Car Reports, I did feel very frustrated in having wasted 2.5 hours of my time on this endeavor.  I was very upfront and honest with them as to what deal it would take to get my business, and presented all of the printed information as mentioned before, only to have them come back with what I feel was a Low-Ball Trade VAlue on my car.  It was actually $1592 below what it should have been, and the sales manager that Eric had to rely upon for the deal even added an addendum at the bottom of the numbers he brought back saying the price was in lieu of the advertised $500 Best Buy Gift Card AS WELL!!!!!!  I was so frustrated at that point, I was no longer interested in negotiating any further and asked for the keys to my car so that I could leave!  At this point, the Sales Manager that Eric had to use did come out and thank me for coming in, but I have to tell you, it honeestly felt as if whas nothing more than PROTOCOL on his behalf.  Although I did leave frustrated, I have to say that the overall Customer Service was very GOOD!  Eric has to be one of the most courteous and professional sales representatives that I have ever dealt with in looking for a new car.  I hope that John Eagle will see what they have in this gentleman and not let him get away. He is truly an asset for this dealership, and should be in line for bigger and better things in the future.  Having said that, I will be going to the competition tomorrow to follow-up with the printed quote that I have to hopefully close this deal on a New Crosstour.  While I feel that the level of service that I received from Eric was exceptional, I am not willing to pay more for a 2010 Crosstour than what I have quoted in a 2011 Crosstour.  If the GM would like to speak with me beforehand, I would be glad to talk with him, but as of this writing, I have heard nothing.",4.5
338,"December 19, 2010","My husband and I drove 3.5 hours to Houston for a weekend.  Our plan was to find a good used Honda Pilot while we were there.  We knew exactly what we were looking for, and we intended to pay cash, so we wouldn't have to haggle with financing.  On our way in town, we called the dealerships where we had found listings that fit our budget.  John Eagle had the #1 Pilot on our list.  We called Zach at 3:00 and told him we would be there before they closed.  He assured us the advertised car was still on the lot & that we could see it when we arrived.  It was around 7:30 or 8:00 when we arrived.  We were told that (1) Zach had just left and (2) no one knew where the car we were asking about was.  In fact, the rep we spoke with had a list of cars on the lot in his hand, and the Pilot we were asking about was not on his list.  After informing them that we had called a few hours earlier, he left and came back after 10 minutes to tell us -- the car was in the shop for bumper repair & we would not be able to see it.  BUT he did have a list of cars that were $5K over our budget that we could see.  I don't have any proof one way or the other, but is it suspicious that the advertised car suddenly disappeared for minor bumper repair after we'd already called to say we were coming to see it?  We left FEELING like we'd been scammed, and left the dealership as quickly as we could.  We ended up purchasing the next day from another dealership in Houston where we had exactly the opposite experience.  Keep looking -- there are good ones out there.  ",1.0
339,"November 13, 2010","STAY AWAY if shady bait and switch tactics annoy you? .  Drove 40 minutes to dealer to get price on a new odyssey because they would only give me the price in person - not over the phone - only to find out that they were only selling the vehicle at OR ABOVE msrp - and even then only after the salesman spent 20 minutes in the ""manager's area"". Really, they couldn't tell me over the phone that their price was MSRP? Horrible, horrible, shady tactics. I felt dirty after leaving. Stay away if you value your time - other dealers in Houston certainly can offer a better deal and won't waste your time with typical ""unempowered salesman"" tactics. Disgraceful.",1.8

341,"September 23, 2010","Being a savvy shopper, I asked for pricing quotes for a new Honda from all the major dealers in the Houston area.  I received an Internet quote from Terry, who is the Internet Sales Manager.  

Upon my arrival at John Eagle, Terry was unaware of the number of the vehicles he had in stock of the model I wanted.  Second, he was unfamiliar with their location around the small John Eagle lot.  He was amiable during our test drive, but when we arrived back in a cubicle to negotiate, I discovered a very traditional car salesman with many years of experience.  

Every tactic to pad the sale in favor of the dealership was used.  The very classic model of trying to fudge numbers by making the deal seem like it was all tied to a monthly payment amount was the goal.  When they low-balled my trade appraisal and I balked, he went back to ""ask"" the sales manager.  Obviously all along everyone knew the numbers.  This waiting game is sadly common in some dealerships.  After 15 minutes, Terry happily came back to offer an additional $2,000 on my trade.  Of course he could offer that much--the dealership was planning to make up for the money with non-optional options they've tacked on.  

These ""options"" are things such as paint sealant (aka wax), fabric protectant (aka Scotchguard), Nitrogen-filled tires ($199 for air...hmm), data dots, and the list goes on.  None of these items could be removed.  All told, the extras inflated the pricing by nearly $2,000.  When I informed Terry I was late for a meeting, he again disappeared for a few seconds and reappeared with a ""closer"": Peggy.  What a sad, worn-out sales gimmick.  Then, when I finally was allowed to leave, both Terry and Peggy tried desperately to get me to commit to a time I would return that evening.  Terry went so far as to offer a car to drive--all so I would come back ASAP before I talked with other dealers or did more research.  

Another gimmick utilized was the phrase ""up to"".  If you haven't researched this, I highly recommend Googling.  Any time the customer gives a number, the salesman replies with ""Up to?"" in order to subliminally make the customer feel that they may need to offer more.  Psychologically, it works very well, but it is a dishonest way to do business.

I happily purchased a new Honda from another Houston dealership that does not pressure their clients nor add extras to their vehicles to swindle customers.  I feel badly for those who do not do homework and fall prey to the old-school, dishonest tactics used by John Eagle Honda.",1.3
342,"August 09, 2010","I went there in May 2010 and a price was agreed upon.  Unfortunately the color I wanted was not in stock so I was given the option of waiting until June/July for the same price.  I gave them a deposit per their request but didn't sign any paperwork as the salesperson, Chris, said it wasn't necessary.  The car finally comes in early August, but they wanted to increase the price.  I was not happy with the price increase and didn't purchase the vehicle that day.

To make a long story short, the General Manager called me and gave me the original deal.  He showed me that John Eagle Honda does care about customer service and wants to ensure all customers are satisfied.  He turned my not so pleasant experience to a good one.  Chris was very helpful, courteous and kept us informed on when the car was due to arrive.",4.0

It only took a short test drive to know I found the car I wanted, and as everyone knows, that's the easy part. I sat down and started talking numbers hesitantly, and I was very pleasantly surprised. After agreeing on fair offer for my trade and a great price on the new Accord, I started working with Matt in Finance who got everything together for me quickly. If I had a question, Matt had the answer, and the finance manager Trey was very helpful as well.

344,"May 20, 2010","John Eagle Honda sent me a competitive price quote via email.  I confirmed price with salesman and manager before driving to the dealership to purchase the vehicle.  Despite setting an appointment, the salesman was not prepared and was unable to answer questions I had asked earlier in the day.  After an hour of waiting, he reveals that the quoted price was a ""mistake"", and that they could only honor it if I would agree to unwanted options that increased the price by more than 10% (excluding the destination charge).  These options could not be excluded even if I ordered a new car and asked for them not to be included.  Their price went from being very competitive to more than $1200 more than other quotes from reliable dealerships. They essentially used a 'price mistake' to perpetrate a Bait & Switch scam.  Both the manager and salesman participated in the predatory sales tactic.

For a dealership as lousy as this one to have such a high rating on dealerrater.com makes me question the truthfulness of this site's reviews.  I will never consider doing any business with John Eagle Honda again.",1.3

He was genuinely concerned about getting all of my repairs taken care of while calming my fears about expenses.  He shared that he also drove an older Honda, and we talked about common issues seen in our vehicles.  You could tell that he truly knew what he was talking about.  Danny quickly checked my car into service and was back very shortly with a very thorough report of the condition and expenses to be expected.  I thanked him for his time and agreed to the repairs.

1) Customer Service - They are honest and don't try to sell me servicing that my car doesn't need.  They often will provide a loan car if a big repair will take too long to wait - some of the other dealers will not loan a car at all - that's a big deal to me.

2) Quality of Work - I have never had to take my car back because the repair was not done right.

3) Friendliness - Always.

4) Overall Experience - They have always tried harder than other dealers to please us. The car is ready when they say it will be, and also cleaned up.  They obviously value their customers' repeat business.  You wonder how indifferent companies manage to stay in business.

5) Price - They look for ways to save me money, such as manufacturer warranties that other shops might overlook.  A case in point: when the emissions control broke on my older car, they discovered a manufacturer warranty that saved over $400 to repair.

You can buy a Honda anywhere but you can NOT buy the kind of service that John Eagle in Houston provides.  It is priceless.

We were transferred to New Mexico for two years and I drove 1300 hundred miles round trip to have my oil changed and have my car serviced at John Eagle. There is a  John Eagle in Dallas but I still drive  to Houston to have my oil changed and the car serviced. 

Mike Mueller has always been my service person.  He is absolutely wonderful.  He is so helpful and always makes sure everything is done right.  He just goes above and beyond what he has to. Once I was visiting my Mom in Louisiana and water was coming out of my car and I called the Honda dealership there and described the problem and they told me they would have to take the dashboard out and it would be several thousand dollars and the car was only two years old.  I promptly called Mike in Houston and he asked me a couple of questions and told me what  was wrong(which was nothing -I just had turned on a wrong switch)!!  He was so helpful and patient .No matter where I am if there is a problem I call him!!!  He always makes sure I have a loaner car that I understand.  He makes sure I am in and out quickly because I drive so far. He is just a fine young man and does a great job!!!

David Kent the service manager is also wonderful.  He is so friendly and helpful.

Had some light on the car on after I took it to some kwick car lube for an oil change, big mistake, But talked to Jose Santigo and the lube guys there check it out and told me they never replaced some oil can and had striped the bolt holding the oil. Nedless to say Jose Santiago helped me so much and if it wasnt for his knowlege would have thought it was the motor or took it to some slum shop and sold me on a 1000 dollor repair for just a bolt and new oil filter.

386,"January 21, 2010","I have been a customer of John Eagle Honda for many years.  I bought my station wagon from Ammar Sheikh many years ago when the dealership was on 1960.  In the past 10 years, we have bought an Odyssey, 1 new CRV, 2 used CRV's, Ridgeline and my current Pilot.  I have received excellent service at the purchase of each vehicle.  Each salesman showed he had my best interest in mind and did everything he could to satisfy my needs, which was financial.  As far as service goes, everyone is always very polite and helpful.  I always go to Matt Schonacher.  I can call or come in with questions, concerns or problems and Matt is always there to help.  I had a noise in the dash that got louder when the fan on the air conditioner increased and Matt just listened for a minute and knew exactly where it was.  He went in behind my glove box and found a trapped piece of paper towel that was flapping in the wind.  My Pilot was running hot one day as I was driving by, I pulled in and another service rep came out immediately and took care of me.  He touched the radiator cap and it was not hot, no smoke or anything, but kept me back as he slowly released the cap and radiant fluid sprayed all over him.  He kept his cool and just laughed.  I was taken care of within a matter of about 30 minutes.  My loaner car is always ready when I arrive after notifying Matt I'm coming in.  If Matt is not around, the other reps immediately try to locate him.  If he is off a day when I have a problem, someone else always steps up to the plate to take care of me.  I could say nothing bad about the employees at this dealership.    ",5.0
387,"January 21, 2010","Currently, I own 3 Pilots and 1 Odyssey, and previously, 2 Accords and 1 Civic, all purchased from John Eagle Honda, Houston.  And purchased because of one reason, SERVICE AFTER THE SALE.  Mr. Glenn Holender was my previous service manager/writer and over the years proved to be a most worthy service manager.  At times of service, I was always greeted courteously, my automobiles were serviced promptly and returned on schedule.  I have never had to return an auto for any ""re-do"" of service.  

After Mr. Holender was promoted upstairs, Matthew Schaunaker, my new service writer, had some very large shoes to fill.  Mr. Schaunaker has performed his duties most admirably and has taken excellent care of my Honda service and repair needs, always with the same service awarded me by Mr. Holender.  

As I, my wife, daughter and son, have brought our cars in for service, a phone call, in advance to Mr. Schaunaker, was all that was needed.  Mr. Schaunaker would meet us in the drive thru, offer a friendly hand shake, get right to the problem at hand, give us the keys to a loaner car, and we were on our way, in a matter of minutes.  Later that same day, Mr. Schaunaker would call informing us that our auto was ready. If an unknown problem was discovered during the service or repair, Mr. Schaunaker would call me, explain the problem in detail along with the costs to attend to the repair, and an approval was granted.  No hard sale, just good business.

I don't believe that words can adequately describe the service I and my family have received from Mr. Schaunaker and John Eagle Honda.  If I wanted to, I could shop any car dealer in Houston, but have no desire to do so.  The Honda Pilots and the van have proven to be very reliable automobiles, but the auto is just a good as the service people who stand behind it, and is there, when you need them, after the sale.  I believe your company calls it, ""The Eagle's Edge.""  Whatever it is, I like it.

The project which was completed in November required purchasing quite a number of OEM parts (some of them several times) for use as templates and/or to be modified for my purposes. Chris Lynn in John Eagle’s parts department has always been patient, helpful and has done a great job of locating the special parts I need- and getting them shipped in a timely manner. The parts department has also supported my custom build by authorizing a special discount on select parts whenever possible. I work with Stan on occasion and he is equally thorough and knowledgeable. 

Over the last couple years my car has needed some occasional warranty work as well. Danny Wright on the John Eagle service drive has always been courteous and professional as has Jeremy Reardon in discussing these minor issues with me and getting them resolved. I'm generally in an out of the shop in less than an hour (with or without an appointment) and my car is always handled with great care.

I understand I am to write the reason 'Why' I gave the ratings I gave....

Danny Wright is WONDERFUL! I believe it was 1998 when I purchased my first Honda, then a second in 2001. I can't remember any other service adviser that has treated me as well as Danny. He is considerate of my time and always helpful. He always gives a great explanation of what needs to be done and gets it done ASAP. I moved to Humble in 2008 and would make the trip all the way up there just for an oil change because of the exceptional service I receive from him. In 2009, I moved back to Houston and purchased a Chevy Tahoe. I will not name the dealership, but I will say, there is no comparison. When its time to trade in again, I will be going back to a Honda and definitely to John Eagle. In the mean time, I will be bringing it in for every oil change and anything else that can be done at John Eagle to avoid taking it to the dealer I bought it from. I don't/won't go anywhere else.

They fixed my truck and got it back to me in just a couple of days. I was happy with the service and the speed that they got it back to me. I would def. recommend this place. ,5.0
433,"January 20, 2010"," Had problems with my car that local mechanic could not deal with so I brought in and Danny took care of it.  Back on the road again.  Just can't wait to get back on the road again, just like cruising with all my friends, and I just can't wait to get back on the road again.",5.0
434,"January 20, 2010","I brought a 91' Prelude in a couple months ago. I really didnt know to much about the car seeing as it was my girlfriends. The guy that helped me was really awsome. He was very informative and friendly. The guys name was Danny Wright. If you are goin to get your car worked on there, I suggest you ask for him. I got my car back within like 3 days. All in all, just a good experience. ",5.0
435,"December 30, 2009","I have dealt with Gillman, Goodson, Ruselle & Smith, Streater Smith, Honda Cars of Katy. My experience at John Eagle Honda has been THE WORST. My first complain was their service. I have never spent more than 3 hours at a dealership. This time, my husband and I spent 5 hours. Not that the sales were working with us the entire time. The sales would talked to us for a few minutes and then told us to hold on and disappear for 30 plus minutes. The dealership that day was NOT packed. I believe the purpose of doing this is to see how much we want to buy. The car is for my husband and he had searched many Hondas and only very few has it. When he found it, he wants it very much. From willing to sit there for 5 hours, the sales knew that my husband wanted the car very much. Therefore, the sales on purposely played games and would not negotiate / lower the price. 

Even the price was not good at all, my husband still would buy it if the trade in for his old car was reasonble. ""Reasonable"" in our mind was $500. Guess how much John Eagle offered us? $100 !!! We understand that the car was very beat up and had many many problems. But, we also know that as long as the car moves, it will still worth a couple of hundred. ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS? Come on! 

For five hours, I sat there patiently because I know how much my husband wants this car. But, I had enough and advise to leave. 

Later that day, we sold the car to Carmax for $1200.

436,"September 19, 2009"," We had previously purchased two vehicles from this dealership. We called and received a price on a new Pilot. We went in the following day, for a test drive and gave them a deposit to find the vehicle for us. Lewis had given us pricing (about $2000)on some things they put on their vehicles (tinting, windshield protection, paint protection, data dots, and a Pro Pack with accessories). I did some research over the weekend and determined I did not want all the extras , and called on Monday to let him know. The position he took was that they ""do not renegotiate"". We had not even signed paperwork at this point. Ammar is the sales manager, and he had told my wife he would contact me, which he did not do. I ended up cancelling the check and going to a more reputable dealer. Apparently options aren't optional at John Eagle Honda. By the way, their pricing on accessories at the time of sale is almost double what you can buy them for at the same dealership later.",2.0
437,"April 19, 2008","This is back in July 2006 but I should have posted it back then. We were in a hurry to replace a vehicle that had been totalled.  We seriously considered a 2000 (maybe 2001?) Accord with 100,000 miles on it.  We were told it had been meticulously maintained and even that the service work had been done at that dealership.  The sales person supposedly knew the prior owner. After consulting with our auto mechanic, he told us to find out if it had the original timing belt.  The sales person hemmed and hawed and eventually had to admit that the service work had not been done at that dealership, he couldn't verify any prior maintenance and he couldn't contact the prior owner.  A total change in story.  The sales person knew we were in a hurry and thought he could give us a snow job.  We ran the other direction and will never go back to John Eagle Honda.",3.0
438,"February 17, 2005","I took my wife's 2002 Odyssey to have oil changed and specifically asked not to run it through their scratch-o-matic car wash.  The van came back wet!  After voicing my displeasure loudly, I got the oil change for free and an apology from the service mgr.  I've also tried on many occasions in the past to buy a car from this dealership (including the Odyssey) and always found a better deal elsewhere.",1.8
439,"February 19, 2004","'91 Civic failed emissions but runs strong.  Took in to have them diagnose problem.  They did a compression test and basically told me I needed a whole new engine $3K+ !!  Found a small garage with an honest mechanic.  After cleaning the intake manifold (~$60), the car passed with flying colors!  John Eagle Honda didnt even suggest this alternative, nor were the compression numbers that bad for a 13 year old car.  Service reps at John Eagle are friendly and they have nice facilities, but the technical department and advice is lacking.  Go there for their bigscreen tvs and coffee, but not if you have a real problem with your car.",3.3
