22,"January 01, 2019","First, I want to acknowledge Cody for working with me to get my Optima in the shop over the Christmas holidays for factory recall repairs. Yes, I was a work-in. I arrived at my scheduled time (9AM). My wife had followed me to the dealership so we could run other errands in town. I was told the car would be ready in a couple of hours. Long story short--after several calls to check on the status we picked the car up at 4:30pm.  I would rather be told up front that you will keep the car all day and I can plan accordingly. Also, I didn't notice until the next morning when looking in my console storage that it had been rummaged thru and several items were between the passenger seat and the passenger door.  Nothing appears to be missing thank goodness. My 3 factory recalls were performed and I appreciate it. May want to tighten up on security of vehicles in the shop/repair area or remind folks to clean up inside the vehicle after servicing (if they move items around inside the vehicle).",4.2

30,"December 29, 2018","I bought a vehicle on October 26. I was given temp tags expiring December 25. Thanksgiving came and I still had not received my plates. I called Crown Kia and was assured they would arrive on time. Christmas came, and still no plates. I called again and this time was informed that the car had to be inspected by their service dept. before plates could be issue. This was not eplained to me at purchase. In fact, when I bought the car, I was asked to leave it at the lot one more day. That would have been plenty of time to inspect it.
On Dec. 28, I brought the car in for inspection. The service center took very good care of us. The crew member was very polite, and service was prompt.
I then went to the front desk to get new temporary tags since the first ones were now expired. I was told a sales associate had to put the tag on my car. But all sales people were in a meeting so I had to wait. They all shuffled out of their meeting, and none were too eager to help me. One finally agreed and asked the receptionist for the cordless drill. The battery was dead. Then the salespeople were all called back into a meeting, and the receptionist plugged the battery in to charge. Some time later the sales people came out again. The sales person who agreed to help me checked the battery. Still dead so she went to her desk without ever saying a word to me. Another sales person walked by and I asked him if I could just have a screwdriver. He went and opened a desk drawer and said he didn't have one. I was visibly frustrated by this point, and then a third salesperson yelled to the first two to ""go to the service dept and get a screwdriver so this gentleman can leave!"" So she came back with the screwdriver, but I still had to wait even longer because the receptionist had not yet printed and laminated my new temp tag.
So my experience with the service dept itself was very pleasant, but my whole overall experience was very UNpleasant!

43,"December 12, 2018","Took my car in for an oil change. Asked that they not touch my rims because the last time they messed with my rims they put the lug nuts on too tight. When I got my car back it was shaking and pulling to one side. I took the car back. I also noticed scratches on 2 rims. The guy at the service desk insisted that no one messed with my rims and also said that the rims were scratched when I dropped off the car. After arguing with him he agreed to ask the service tech if he touched my rims. Turns out the service tech rotated the tires on one side then realized that he wasn’t supposed to touch the rims so he didn’t rotate the other side. He still insisted that the rims were scratched when I dropped off the car. My husband went inside the dealership to talk to the manager because he knows that my rims weren’t scratched. The manager argued with him and told him that if we were so unhappy that we didn’t have to bring the car back. This really upset me. We weren’t looking to get anything for free or at a discount. We just wanted them to acknowledge that they damaged my rims and that they need to hold the service techs to a higher standard. They did put the tires that were rotated back they way that they were supposed to be, but there is still shaking that wasn’t there before I took it to them. Now I feel that I have to take my car somewhere else to find out what is going on. I would really prefer to take my car to the dealer, but how can I feel comfortable doing that? When I had a complaint all they did was try to defend themselves and eventually told me not to bring my car back. What kind of customer service is that? I am really disappointed. I have only had my car serviced at this dealership since the day I bought it brand new from them and the first time that I complained about something this is what happened. ",1.8

45,"December 11, 2018","I had a problem with the steering. When I first carried it in Cody told me there was a recall that may fix the problem. After they replaced the recalled part he had me to take it and see if it had fixed the problem. It didn’t, so I called back and he ordered the part that was needed. When the part came in I took it back in and after 2 hours he came and told me he was putting me in a loaner because it was taking longer than expected.  They replaced my steering column and fixed the problem. I was really impressed with Cody Stansbury the Assistant Parts Manager. He even had it detailed for me. Thanks Crown Kia!",5.0

66,"November 13, 2018","My mom and I visited Crown Kia of Longview. They promised over the phone many things such as a full payoff of her truck and my kia (which I bought from them! Once at the dealership they offered my mom 10k less than what she needed and told her how nice her truck was. They told my mom the deal she got on her truck was highway robbery... Let’s just say the deal didn’t go through and she still owns that truck. On my car they offered me less than what I was promised but I went upside down on my car and bought a Chevy from them. Needless to say they put my car up for sale for more than what I paid for the first time with 40k more miles, and priced it 8k more than what they gave me for it (after telling me it will be hard to sell, needless to say I had many aftermarket features on it, wheels, window tint, touchscreen radio, back up camera etc.) now it’s been 3 months since I’ve had my truck and I haven’t received any paperwork on it, “it’s in the mail” nor I have I received my actual plates, “the states behind” And when I did my down payment they charged me 4K downpaynent rather than only 2k and said that they would give me my money back ONLY if I had proof.

I also got an oil change the first week, but had to ask for the return mileage sticker when I returned the second week.  Also on the second week, my tire light came on and I was told that would get looked at.  Tire light is still on, and now the door with the electric lock not working also now will not even open.

I wled into the service center on 10/13/18 without an appointment, in need of an oil change. Unfortunately, they were so busy they didn't have an opening for my service needs on this day. Due to my work schedule I wasn't going to be able to return any time soon. Mr. Wes then offered to pick up my vehicle from work, bring it to the dealership for servicing and then deliver back to work. This was the best offer I've ever had with a dealerships service dept.

All I can say is bring your letters from Kia and do your research first, and be prepared to repeat yourself. However they do a good job and they work fast for the most part.

He did us. This was a dream for my husband, because he wanted a truck. Chris knew the exact one to put him in. We were amazed at how things went and what our salesman could do.. And just like that... We were driving off the lot with absolutely no down payment , no trade in.. I personally suggest that if your looking for that affordable, right car, go to Crown Kia of Longview and talk to Chris Sheehan, your personal salesman.",5.0

219,"September 12, 2016","After numerous lies and return trips, we left empty handed.  We were told one thing and at closing nothing was what we agreed on.  Very unprofessional with several mistakes.  Avoid this place , RJ the salesman, and the general manager at all costs.  This place tries to deceive with playing the numbers game.  We are heading to Tyler because friends have told us that it was a good car buying experience.  ",1.4
220,"August 28, 2016","When I arrived at this dealership, everything was great. I was greeted almost immediately. Nick listened to my concerns and everything I wanted in the car. He then brought one to me that was still about $2,000 over the budget I asked for. He told me he could work with us and I was ok with this. He gave me a quick walk around and then we took it for a drive. I immediately fell in love with the car. When we came back in the office, the price went from $13,999 to $17,999. Then it changed to $15,999, we worked out the payment and I told him I would need to discuss this with my fiancé. I was then told that this was only the price for that day and it had to be done that day. Because I loved the car, I went out of my way to talk my fiancé into the car. However, when I got online, the exact car I was looking at was listed for $13,999 on their website. That evening, Nick called my cell phone about 7 times. He said he ""could match"" that price but only if we bought that night. We didn't want to make a decision that night, and why the heck would go back to that dealership if the prices were going to be jacked up the next day. I was very frustrated with this entire experience. We drove to Shreveport and bought from there. ",1.8
