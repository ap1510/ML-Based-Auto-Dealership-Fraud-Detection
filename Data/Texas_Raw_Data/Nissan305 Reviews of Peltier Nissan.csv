1,"May 17, 2019","We have owned several vehicles purchased at Peltier Nissan in Tyler, Tx. Our last one was a 2016 Altima.  We were talked into a Lease on this vehicle.  BAD MOVE!!!  However, we trusted our salesperson, Rob Adkinson, but come to find out he is just another car salesperson. I'm sure you know what I mean!! At the signing of this lease, we were NEVER told of a ""Lease Termination Fee"", Maximum miles allowable, an Inspection of the vehicle......NOTHING!!  Also, at the signing of this lease we purchased one of the high end maintenance programs.  You know Oil, Filter, Tire Rotation, Tire/wheel repair/replacement, paint chips/small dings, etc.  Multiple times we took our car in for routine maintenance and requested the tires be rotated.  THE ROTATION NEVER HAPPENED...  This was even acknowledged by the GM.  Bottom line we did NOT get what we paid for on this maintenance program.  We had the Inspection done, however, again we were never told of this.  We learned from a letter received from Nissan.  So now we are at the end of our Lease and we had a cracked windshield.  WE HAD THAT WINDSHIELD REPLACED THE DAY BEFORE WE RETURNED THE VEHICLE TO PLETIER NISSAN.  We were told by both the salesperson and the GM the day we returned the vehicle (and windshield was replaced) that we owed nothing as a result of the End of Lease Liabilities.  Now we received a letter from Nissan stating we owed $ 662.35 for Excess Mileage.....Excess wear......Lease Termination Fee.  Excess Wear means Nissan wants us to pay $215.00 for THE cracked windshield we already replaced.  This is nothing to do with a Lease or a Purchased.  It's all about NOT believing everything you are told.

Oh, one more thing.... Mitch in the Service Area is Extremely Great to work with.  When Mitch was not available we used another Service Writer and on numerous occasions things were added to our work order request that we DID NOT request, I guess so the Dealership could be reimbursed for things that were not requested and most likely not performed.  Kinda like the Tire Rotations!!


I am sorry it has come down to this and I am sure some will be upset at my review.  But, you know  sometimes the truth without all the sugar coating needs to be revealed to open eyes.

Will be the LAST Nissan or at least from this Dealership for us.

2,"March 31, 2019",The service department was really friendly from the start. I left my vehicle with them for service. They notified me their concerns regarding my vehicle in a knowledgeable way. I choose for the dealership to fix my truck and I'm so glad I did. It could have cost me the expense of a new engine. They ordered the parts and had my vehicle ready in a timely manner. ,5.0
3,"March 19, 2019","Brought my Rogue in for service. They quoted a MASSIVE job amount, but we needed the car fixed so told them to go ahead with the work. After calling other businesses throughout the day we find out that their price is DOUBLE most other places, including OTHER NISSAN DEALERSHIPS! When we went to ask them why it’s double the price, we were told by a manager that “Peltier doesn’t compete with anyone in Tyler. All of our dealerships are like that.”  Not only that, but they INCREASED our bill and never told us. Now we owe them even more without ever being told the price was going to go up even more than double everyone else we called. Do yourself a favor and bring your vehicle ANYWHERE ELSE to get serviced. They intentionally charge 200% markups on their parts over other Nissan dealerships just because they can. They charge $200 per hour for labor, and tack on hours of labor for work that should take minutes. They charged me 1 hour of labor at $200 for changing out 4 spark plugs. Email me if you want and I’ll send you a copy of the invoice so you can see for yourself.",1.2
4,"February 11, 2019",They have excellent service and great staff.  They make you feel comfortable and right at home when you enter the lot.  A special thanks the Greg Strickland for his excellent customer service and helping me find the right vehicle for me.  Any needing a dependable ride for great cost visit Peltier Nissan Tyler.  ,4.8
5,"January 01, 2019",Traveling all the way from  New Orleans was definitely worth it! Kendrick Price (Sales) was extremely patient and accommodating. Considering the cancelled and missed flights. LOL!!!! He still managed to make it the best car buying experience I’ve ever had.  I’d also like to thank Jeremy Pollard (Finance). Jeremy was kind enough to answer all of my questions. He worked expeditiously so that I travel back home. I did not me feel pressured during this deal at all! Thank you guys and I will definitely be recommending you to all my family and friends!!!!! WHO DAT!!!!!! ,5.0
6,"August 15, 2018","Dealership service bay opened on time. Employee smiling, processed my car quickly for the inspection & service.  Afterward went over results of inspection and other items checked.",5.0
7,"July 29, 2018","I don’t really have the time to write a long explanation but I’ll be brief.

Bought my car from them and was told that it went through a full inspection check, I’m not confident that it did. This was in March.

We’ve been having terrible noise and issues with our brakes. After taking it in to get looked at three times at different places. The mechanics have  said that the brake pads are new but the rotors are terrible and it looks like the guys cut corners and only did the brake pads to cut cost. It also won’t start after filling up(probably why he didn’t let me start the car when I test drove it)They are saying it’s a bad sensor and this problem has been reoccurring since we purchased it. 

Reached out to my sales guy(cool guy)
Robert, asked him if I could bring it back so they can fix the issue that they should have fixed at first and he said it was normal wear and tear. I’m not sure I believe that with the three random mechanics saying the same thing on the issue and how the dealership should have done that.

Robert mentioned he would pass my info along to the service manager and I have not heard anything or gotten a call and it’s been about three weeks.

I thought highly of this dealership with the customer service but experienced different.

1. Integrity- if you say something’s been done and that you will have someone get in touch with me “do it!”  
I guess next time I’ll just need to ask for a itemized inspection sheet or something to make sure they are speaking the truth.

I’m not trying to be sour but I’m just rating my experience overall up this point with this dealership and vehicle. 

Hope something can be done because this is just inconvenient. Also having my wife and 2 year old daughter I drive around everyday makes me concerned about their safety.

I felt like corners were cut,lied to,and with this kind of situation I feel like “make the sale no matter what” came before customer service!

40,"February 02, 2018","Peltier has always been the dealership my family and I have purchased our vehicles through, and I have to say we have had a great experience every time. From the moment you pull up to years later when you're getting your car serviced or looking for something new, you're treated like family. Jake King was extremely patient with me when I began my search for a new vehicle for my family. Between the test drives, the detailed overviews of every vehicle I looked at, and the answers to all my questions, there was no pressure or nagging like you get at a lot of dealerships. He encouraged me to take my time to make the right purchase and was confident that regardless of where else I went, Peltier Nissan would be able to provide me with the best service and best car. Jake checked in with me over the next week to follow up with me on how my search was going (he did not blow up my phone like most salesmen and was very respectful of my time and work schedule). After several days of research and test drives, I quickly realized I would be sticking with the quality service and quality cars that peltier offers. I went back and made my purchase. Randy, the finance manager, was extremely upbeat and easy to talk to. His personality and humor made it a lot less painful to walk away with a new car note. He worked with my budget and gave me an EXCELLENT deal. After I completed my purchase, Jake helped me unload my old car and then walked me through all the bells and whistles of my new car. Overall, my experience was great! Thank you Jake and Randy!",5.0

45,"January 22, 2018","Sales rep., Kendrick Price, was honest and respectful. He listened carefully to my questions and provided useful information. Kendrick never pressured me to make a purchase.
General manager, Joshua Hartman was cordial and welcoming to me, but, more important, treated his salesman with respect. The people working there seemed happy and relaxed.
I am leaving the Peltier on my new car - something I never do.
They are a good group.

95,"October 17, 2017","First - my salesman was great and this review is simply an FYI for other buyers.  I'm happy with my truck and happy with my deal; However the 120 point inspection they throw around to make you feel good about the vehicle is a joke.  We put 500 miles on the vehicle when I decided to check the air filter........really?  It looks like it hasn't been changed in 40,000 miles.  I'm fairly certain an air filter would be high on the list of things to inspect.  In addition to the air filter, the tires are marginal at best and one of them shouldn't have passed inspection.  Yes I inspected the tires and new their life span was short but after replacing, one of them was much worse than the rest and should have been replaced.
I've already replaced all of them but just another example of their inspection process being worthless.   ",2.8

148,"September 15, 2017",I thought I had no choice other than another old car at a high price. I was there for a recall and more repairs on my old Altima. The Altima had 229 thousand miles and was almost to the point of no return. Jake walked up and offered a trade up. I told him what my situation really was including a below 600 credit score. He said Nissan has special programs for people like me. I took a chance and it paid off. Nissan showed us a better way. I was finally able to get a brand new car. You do not know the relief this brings. So before you head back to the tote the note or the high priced high mileage dealer give them a chance to help you out. You might just get a new car at a lower intrest. I know your situation; I am you. I was thinking there is no way out. Nissan can be the light at the end of the tunnel.

292,"August 29, 2016","I was pleased with the sales experience at Peltier.  The salesman, Jordan, treated me with respect, answered all my questions, and was patient while I decided exactly when I was ready to finish the deal.",5.0
293,"August 28, 2016","Found a vehicle online and drove 5 hours round trip with the intention of buying. When we got there, the vehicle was brown instead of black. Color listed on Internet and their website had black listed. Manager stated that technically it was expresso black. No where in the listing, even under description, was expresso black listed. Color was listed as black with no more info. 
The pictures on the internet were not where you were able to distinguish the paint color. This wasn't intentional but since the dealership listed it as black, one would assume it would be black 


The vehicle had a lot of stains and wear. 
The front bumper had been dented and repainted and the paint did not match the rest of the vehicle. 
After pointing all this out the manager came down $1000 which was not enough for me to get a vehicle that was brown and had a paint issue on the front bumper that was very noticeable. 

The salesman was nice and mentioned giving us gas money for our trouble but we never got any. 

We were very upset after driving 5 hours on our day off and made our kids spend the day traveling for a vehicle that was not what we thought. 

Please be aware a vehicle may not be what it seems on the Internet. ",2.0

297,"September 22, 2015","I contacted peltier Nissan online requesting information on a frontier.  
My elderly father was interested in trading in his 15 year old frontier for a current model. We were fortunate to have Jeremy pollard return our inquiry   He spent several days searching for, locating and working with my father; finally completing the sale to my father's delight.  The process started on Monday and was concluded by Friday. The frontier was exactly as represented and my father was able to walk in purchase and leave the dealership within an hour of his arrival. Thank you for making the transition to a newer model so effortless for him!!!",5.0
298,"June 01, 2015",   I would like to express to everyone horrible the staff is at Peltier Nisaan. My fiancé bout me a 2015 Rouge last Monday there in Tyler. We both took a short test drive and went back to make a deal. We bought the vehicle and signed all the papers and was never once told anything about customer satisfaction. After 7 days and 400 miles I am very unhappy with the vehicle. We called to talk with them about bringing it back and the sales manager was very rude to my fiancé. We talked with another dealership and they said they take vehicles back all the time as long as it has not been titled yet which ours has not. These are the most rude people. All they are worried about is getting you to sign the dotted line then telling you it's your problem if you do not like it. We plan on reporting these people directly to Nisaan and to the owner of Pelteir to see that other people do not get treated as we have.  We feel as if customer satisfaction is the last thing they worry about once you sign the papers. Please do not fall victim to these horrible people here. ,1.0

300,"July 02, 2014","Peltier Nissan is the greatest.  The service person rode with me and evaluated the possible problem.  When he got back to the dealership, the mechanic confirmed the first service person's theory and an estimate was given to me as the repairs were not covered by warranty.  As the first service person had explained, his thoughts of the possible issue were not necessary to repair but could be repaired.  He explained that it had to do with the great gas mileage that my car gets and if the repair were made, it would change the sound of the initial ""take off"" from 0-30 but would reduce my gas mileage.  While he was working on this, I was taken to the salesman who sold me this car to talk about possibilities of a brand new Nissan.  My son, Jordan McGuire, who helped me purchase my 2009 Nissan, had referred me to Luis Nunez. Jordan also refers other students from college at Huntsville SHSU to Luis. I had requested a meeting with Sales, through written communication with the dealership, during the week prior to my appointment.  Luis Nunez  is friendly, patient with the customer yet fast on getting answers about the inventory and potential contract on a new vehicle, and totally professional.  I will continue to request Luis anytime I am looking for an new vehicle for me, my son, and my husband.  The transaction was finalized by Randy Cantu, Financial Director, who also was involved with both the sales of the 2009 Nissan and now the 2014.  He too, is very professional, friendly, and quick but thorough with all the paperwork which needs to be signed.  However, Randy will take as much time as needed to explain the paperwork, such as the extended warranty to an old person, like myself.  Thank you Peltier, Luis and Randy as well as the Service Department.  I continue to do business with you..   ",5.0
301,"October 24, 2013","I found a used vehicle at Peltier Nissan in Tyler, TX on their website and contacted Doug Kinnard about it. I told him we would be coming from Monroe, LA to look at it and asked him specific questions about it. I texted him the next day to say we were coming on Friday, 10/11/2013. I texted him again on Friday and said we were about an hour away from him. He still waited until we drove up to bother going out to the vehicle. The dealership was not busy when we arrived and about 12 salesmen were all standing in the parking lot staring at us. They claim the NADA value of the vehicle is $24,775 and they are giving the customer a “discount” of $2775, to make their price $22,000. I told him that neither the KBB or the NADA value of their exact vehicle were over $23,350. Doug said “Oh well our system generates the NADA value for us and it may be a bit inflated”. Seriously?  The vehicle was so dirty that I had to figure out myself how to clean the windshield so that I could test drive it, Even though he started the test drive and made us switch drivers down the road. But he didn't bother cleaning it off. When he started it, it wouldn't turn over. It did on the 3rd attempt. There was a light on and he said he would get it over to the service center to have it checked. Said it ""may"" have an aftermarket gas cap?? Then when I asked for the Carfax report we found out it had been sold at auction twice and used as a fleet vehicle. And it was only 2 years old. I was told none of this over the phone. I tried to send him pics and vin info on my car to get a trade in estimate before going over. He didn't want to do that. The KBB and NADA trade in values on my care were $2500 to $3250. He offered us $750 for it. Clean title and one owner, never wrecked. Today, 10/24/2013, their website now has the “discount” listed as $6275, and their asking price is now $18,500. Oh and one more thing, we had to take our 6 year old out of school and bring him with us since we had to travel 3.5 hours one way. As I walked with him by a group of bored salesmen standing together telling stories one threw out 2 cuss words in one sentence within ear shot of us. Unprofessional. Needless to say, it was a totally wasted trip for us and I would recommend that NO ONE ever shop at Peltier Nissan of Tyler, TX!!!!!!",1.0
302,"November 03, 2012","I took my $42k vehicle in for a warranty repair on the A/C. They repair required removing the dash. During the repair, Peltier damaged the dash, back seat, glove box, radio bezel. They made an attempt to ""repair"" the parts to no avail. I was then told that even though they did damage the vehicle, it was my problem and that they would not complete the repair. In addition, they forgot to fill the vehicle up with oil on its first oil change. I found this out after towing my boat 250 miles. Nissan makes great products, but stay away from this dealership at all costs. They will ruin your vehicle.",1.8
303,"December 06, 2011","Luis was a very nice, courteous salesman. &#160;He followed our instructions just as we outlined for him, only had to go to him one time and he followed all our instructions. The sale was very easy and one of the quickest I've ever done. He explained what he was supposed to explain very clearly and he did his job real well.",5.0
304,"October 19, 2011","The used car I purchased was in a wreck and I had to really grill the salesman and manager to find out what damage the car had had when they got it.  I did get a decent price for the car but the three minor issues I had w/ the car never got fixed although the salesman promised he would take care of it before I picked up the car. When I came to pick up the car the tire was flat, and the salesman said he checked it himself. There antenna repair had not been done and the tire valve caps were still missing. When I asked the salesman (for the fourth time) to handle it, he said it would have to be done on the ""downlow"" .  I had told them for days to have it done for the price I agreed to purchase the car for.  He never made it right and they cashed my hold check and I was supposed to have it returned. Still waiting for the returned check. Still waiting for the salesman to repair the antenna and still waiting for the manager to return my complaint call. It has been 2 weeks. P.S..a bit of advice, if you are female you will be referred to as ""kiddo"" by Matt even though he knows you are older than him. I know that if I was a 41 year old male, I would have not got near the condescending treatment. ",2.4
