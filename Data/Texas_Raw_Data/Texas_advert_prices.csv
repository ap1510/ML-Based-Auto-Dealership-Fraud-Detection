21,27-Jun-17,"I've have a relationship with this dealer for almost 20 years.  I no longer trust them.  Everyone in the used car department is in on the scam.  I visited them to buy a truck.  Don pressed me to make an offer on one on the lot so it did.  He did not pass it on the the sales manager (Mr. Brooks) so when I was presented with a purchase agreement, there was no indication that my offer was relayed.  Further, the price of the truck on the sales agreement was now $6,000 higher than advertised .  Outrageous considering Mr. Brooks convinced me to come back after the truck wouldn't start for a test drive saying he would 'make me a deal' in light of the failure.  Bait and switch.  I walked away.  Two weeks later the same truck is still listed everywhere (Cars.com, Autotrader.com, and their own website) but now FOR THE PRICE I OFFERED.  I went to them to initiate the sale the day after the price was changed but was told it was sold two days prior.  In essence the price was changed but the truck was not on the lot any more and they had no intention of selling it at the advertised price.  That is Fraud!  These people are scam artists from the top down.  No honor.  Please don't waste your time.  I certainly won't waste any more of mine.",1,1
30,30-Dec-16,"I have only written a few reviews in my life and tend to be positive but this was a HORRIBLE experience!!!! My wife did not want to go with me to look at cars any more after this experience which says a lot! She used to get her car inspected there. NOT ANY MORE! 
 I went in to look at a car a while back and they asked what my budget was. I said 10-11k but if it was exactly what I wanted then I might could do 13k. The salesman said I think I have just what you would like, a 2015 Corolla with all the bells and whistles and low miles. I asked how much it was and the guy said $13,000 something but dont worry it will be in budget.
I test drove the car to pick up my wife at their suggestion and liked it so they ran the #s for me and the car was over 15k? I asked why it was not 13 like he said and he could not give me a straight answer and had his manager come over. The manager was condescending, ignoring the salesmans statements of it being 13k (maybe that was the negotiable price but they did not start there). 
The manager finally started trying to negotiate a price lower and wanted to run my credit. I told them I didnt want them to run my credit and that I knew it was over 700 and would be fine. The manger said if I put in my info and social security (which I should have not done) they could do a soft pull that would not affect my credit or show up on reports. I asked again and he said I promise. Next day I looked and sure enough a hard pull is on my credit for the next 2 years. That was a manager that blatantly lied! 
We tried to leave and he kept trying to make a sale and got more condescending acting like I was being stupid and mean to them for not buying from them and that I should ""work with them on the price"". If he was honest, upfront and serving my needs instead of his own and got me that car at 13k  I would have been happy but I told him that I had options and didnt have to use him. 
They offered me a horrible value on my truck to top it off when they were suppose to be giving ""top value""that day. I also heard their sales pitch to multiple people while there.
Another manager texted after I left wondering what was wrong. I said that their managers are lieing and he He said they would make me
They ask you what your monthly budget is and then ask if you could budge just a little bit to get a better car. Same pitch every time to get you to spend more instead of meet your needs and stay in budget. Go somewhere else and save your money. My brother had a horrible experience as well which I found out after the fact.

41,29-Aug-16,"At 9 months pregnant on bed rest I requested quotes online for the vehicle we were looking for before making our way out to a dealership to finalize.  I spoke with Bruce Phillips at least 3 times to confirm the price quoted and the details, leaving no ambiguity to chance.  I also asked for this to be a fast process as I was to be on bed rest but we wanted to finish the car buying before delivery. He would not provide a written quote due to concern with another dealer matching it that would have been closer to us in Dallas.  Fair I understand the logic. 
Trekked our way to the dealership for a 3 pm appointment, Bruce confirmed our price again but then handed us off to another representative at 4, until then we were just waiting.  Mike Weide took us on a test drive then sat us down for pricing.  The price quoted was no where found on the sheet (not even the subtotal), Mike told us Bruce must have misunderstood what out the door pricing means (really?).  We went back and forth and were able to get the subtotal to the price we initially were quoted for ""out of the door"".  Mike guaranteed us we would not find a better deal anywhere, actually laughed when we said we had a better deal from other dealerships who clearly understand what out the door means, he guaranteed us there was ""no way"" as he is the fleet manager (this is not on his business card).  So 3.5 hours later we left with a business card with a hand written quote on the back.   Same day we got the deal we had told Mike we had at another Acura dealer, WITH the add-ons Mike was trying to charge for.  I have never been so disappointed in a car buying process, this is my 3rd new car purchase.  It is unfortunate how little trust you can put in some people, the dealership where we ended up purchasing was honest, accommodating and extremely helpful so all is not lost.  Mac Churchill however has some customer service issues they need to work on if you compare their reviews on yelp. google and dealer rater compared to the other Acura dealers.  Take heed.",1,1
61,22-Dec-15,"This place is run by a bunch of unprofessional people  in suits. I can't believe a premium brand like Acura is dealing with these guys. They'll promise you any price that you offer by phone/email just to  get you in the dealership and then will totally do a bait and switch. They have no respect for others time and just want foot traffic in the dealership. I emailed my offer which was promptly agreed to. I even called before getting there just to confirm they'll honor the price I quoted. After doing the test drive they won't even want to talk about what they agreed for.
If you think my offer is too low then why the xxxx can you not let me know before I get there?

Absolutely terrible dealership. If you are going to shell out 40k for a car, buy it from a dealer who can stand by their words and have some professional integrity.",1,1
91,05-Jan-15,"I bought a used vehicle from Mac Churchill and had multiple major issues with the process. Besides not receiving any documentation on the bumper to bumper warranty (even when directly asking), them not honoring a WE OWE for major repairs and failing to cancel my maintenance contract when they repeatedly said they would; The biggest issue is that they inflated the negotiated base sales of the vehicle by $1,500.00 on the sales contract and they lied when directly asking about it. Paul Garrett said there are ""fees rolled into the back-end"". I signed the contract and later found out this is completely false and they flat out jacked the price out on me. When I called their bluff and provided evidence to show they blatantly increased the price, they made up a new contract and said they would submit it to my lender. I went in on several occasions over the next few months and talked with many different finance reps including the assistant finance director Ali. All of them promised the second contract was sent to the lender. After 3 months of demanding why they have not made good on their promise and why my lender still reflected the inflated amount, I finally got to sit down with the Finance director Ray. Ray admitted that they had not sent in the second contract and that there was ""nothing he could do because it was too late"". These guys flat out committed fraud, lied to brush me off and are not offering a resolution. If you want my opinion.... DO NOT BUY FROM HERE!! READ BETTER AND MORE ACCURATE REVIEWS ON YELP!!!!",1,1
173,07-Aug-10,"On May 13, 2010, I went to Mac Churchill Acura in Fort Worth, Texas to purchase the advertised 2010 Acura TL SH AWD w/TECH at the advertised price of $6.  There were not any restrictions, stipulations, or limitations stated in the ad. 

It is my understanding that the law states that a dealership cannot sell a vehicle for more than the advertised price (even if the customer is unaware of the advertised price.) 


I am of the opinion that the $6 price is a mistake someone knew they were making.  It is marketing strategy for the purpose of getting customers to buy something else, or in this matter the same vehicle at a higher price.

To add further insult to injury, my character was defamed by representatives of the dealership in writing.

181,24-Jun-17,"I inquired about an MDX at 40,997. Got a response and all was well. All the sudden there was a ""mistake made"" and the car price was raised to 44995. Autonation audi plano does not stand by their advertised prices. Bait you with one price, switch it to another.",1,2
190,05-Jan-16,So I went in to look at a Q3 and was shown several trim levels all of which I didn't like. I wanted blue with two tone interior. I was told what was the price I would settle for to be color blind to a car trim levels didn't like. Then to find out all along the car I was interested in was in back lot. Then it gets worse dealer didn't want to budge on price and was trying to overcharge me for 400$ window tint way over priced. While I was waiting I contacted Audi of Dallas and got fully loaded Quattro for the price of a stripped Q3 along with free window tint and free rubber floor mats. No fighting over price or add ons. Just make the drive to Audi of Dallas I know it's out of the way but it was worth it...,1,2
302,06-Mar-19,"West Point GMC Buick uses a bait a switch sales technique.  They offer a low price and add extra ""security fees"" and say that you don't qualify for the ""trade in incentives"" even though they knew I did not have a trade in.   I've bought many cars from dealerships before and this was by far the worst experience I've had.",1,6
314,22-Sep-14,"I had a really poor experience at West Point. I believe the name of my salesman was Echo or Etko. I came in to to a 2009 BMW 750LI. It was originally listed on Ebay for 29k, a vehicle with 50k miles. I found that to be the best bargain online and I called in immediately. I originally spoke to a gentleman name Jay and he was very helpful and informative. However my schedule and his conflicted and unfortunately had to deal with Echo. I test drove the vehicle, the BMW had a some type of battery issue and was less than a perfect ride. Even still I figured we can work out a deal, get some of those minor issue corrected and still drive home with a new car. 

Upon working the deal Echo attempted to sell the car to me for about $5000 more than what the advertised price was even AFTER I told him the special. He goes back and comes back and still tries to sell it to me for about $2000 MORE than what the advertised price was and basically write the original arrangement off claiming that whoever listed it for so cheap ""could loose their job"". I was less than amused.

When asked if I could take the BMW to a BMW dealership and have it checked out he said I would have to wait until monday and if there is any other issues that they will not be willing to fix it or address it. 

It was very clear than when he realized he was not going to be making nearly as much on the deal as he hoped he became very short, impatient and downright rude. I asked about warranty and he threw some number at me and wouldnt let me speak to a manager. I really wish I wouldve seen Jay that day and maybe things wouldve been different. ",1,6
343,03-Jan-14,"I was sold a used vehicle that had been wrecked and it was not disclosed to me. I returned to the dealership and they said they would not buy it back and would only take it in on trade at their dealership. I had it for 8 months and they gave me 5,000.00 less than I paid for it. The staff advised me they didn't know and I didn't know so it wasn't their problem. The manager then advised me they made good money selling the car to me and laughed. The dealership would not return my calls and I had to drive back to the dealership to get the problem resolved. They then told me they would sell me a car at cost which they hassled me about until I seen the actual cost price and it was 1,300.00 less than what they quoted me. It was an all around mess and they didn't care. Think twice before using this dealership. My family has bought over 80 vehicles from this dealership and they acted as if they could care less.",1,7
394,31-Jan-17,"Been a regular Customer for over 25 years. Since I'm retired I was looking for a toy.
I asked my son to go and  check out a camaro which was advertised on the net. I trust my son's review on the phone and told him to get a trade in offer on my Hyandai which was done and accepted by me. Camaro price was right in my budget with the trade.
All I  requested was for Finance, to get the paperwork together for me to come in to sign the agreement and take possession of the car.
They waisted the whole day with nonsense requests and at end of day said they would not sell me the car as they feel it was for my son and not me.
Unfriendly sales manager whom I was referred to by the general manager whom I know for years. 
Not only an embarrassing result but a horrible experience.

459,05-Oct-14,"This would have been my second vehicle purchased here. First one was a 2010 Z71. Went to the dealership to purchase a 2014 Silverado which I found on the internet advertised for $29,000. I found the vehicle on the lot then went in the building to find a salesman. When I told him which vehicle I was interested in he let us take it for a test drive. We sat with him and he linked to the website and said it was a great price for the truck with a number of  rebates and incentives. After I said I would like to purchase the vehicle he went to the sales manager and came back and said the vehicle was now $38,000. Additionally, they will REALLY ""low ball"" your trade without anyone physically looking at your trade-in. They also added $3000 to my amount owed on my trade-in and I guess they didn't think I would really look  at the numbers. I didn't get a chance to meet the manager but it seemed like real shady business while I was there and will not be returning to the dealership nor will I recommend this dealership to anyone else. ",1,11
503,28-May-13,"Horrible Service! Salesman gives us the ""lowest quote possible"", then come to find out on their own website lists the truck for $3,000 less! When we told them how much we wanted to pay a month for the truck, the manager Chris called us at home and told us a certain price that we ended up agreeing on. We talked to the Salesman Brian over 3 times in one day discussing finance and telling him that we are going to come in after work to sign the paperwork and pick up the truck, but then on the way over the salesman calls us back and tells us the quote they gave us was for another vehicle, even though all day long we had discussed the price for the original vehicle we wanted. During this conversation the salseman allegedly had a ""dropped call"", but then wouldn't answer the phone anymore when we called him back. Called the manager again and he said we were mistaken and that they weren't going to honor the deal!!! Absolutely horrible customer service, will not recommend and will never use again!",1,12
554,03-Aug-19,"My son and I went to Stonebriar Chevrolet to look at a 2013 Chevrolet Silverado they had advertised on the internet. Upon arrival at the dealership our sales person said the advertised price did not include almost $1000 in “dealer added extras” like window tint, wheel locks, etc. We told the sales person and the sales manager we did not want the “extras” and asked they be removed except for the window tint which was “already done”.   
We bought the vehicle with an added cost of $395 for the window tint. 
The next day my son called to let me know we had been snookered!  Upon closer examination it was clear the window tint was not a “dealer added extra”.  The vehicle had already had the windows tinted which was made obvious by the many small scratches and dings in the tint from the seat belt buckle hitting the window by the previous owner!  So, buyer beware at Stonebriar Chevrolet when you are told the advertised price of a used vehicle does not include ”dealer added extras”.  ",1,14
557,21-Feb-18,"BEWARE of the unethical “Bait and Switch” sales technique used at this dealership! I was a victim of it!! The Internet Sales Manager sent a photo of a truck and the price for THAT truck to me after I signed up with a search service online. I went to the dealership the next day and test drove THAT truck. Since the Internet Sales Manager was not in, another salesperson helped me. After the test drive, I said I’ll take the truck – it was what I wanted and the price was fair. Once we sat down to do the paperwork the salesperson then told me the price would be almost $1000 MORE since they ""forgot to add some options into the price""! WHAT???? They “Bait” me with the photo, test drive and price then “Switch” the price when I say I’ll take the truck! TOTALLY UNETHICAL!! I excused myself for a moment and called my wife who said to RUN from that SCAM DEALERSHIP!! Since my emotions were already involved and I liked the truck I asked if they could do anything about the increase that wasn’t in the original price they quoted to me for THAT truck. The salesperson went to a “Manager” who came down a few hundred. I went ahead and purchased the truck, but felt they ripped me off during the whole process. Once I got home, the process really kicked in! The dealership provided no satisfactory resolution other then to bring the truck in and REMOVE the options. BUT THEN it would NOT be the truck they showed me nor  the one I bought! Per the salesperson, this is a  WARREN BUFFET company owned dealership.  I can only wonder if HE authorized this unethical sales technique. No wonder he’s so rich – SCREW THE COMMON HARD WORKING MAN!! Way to go Warren...mission accomplished!!! The salesperson also lied to me about ""you get two years of FREE oil changes and tire rotations"". WRONG!! I later learned I get TWO OIL CHANGES within the first 24, 000 miles or 2 years....whichever comes first. I like GM products, but this sales channel and experience was AWFUL!",1,14
571,19-Dec-14,"I was looking online for a used suburban, which I found at Stonebriar Chevrolet.  As a busy business owner, my time is valuable.  So, I did my homework and went into the dealership.  I told James (the sales person) which vehicle that I wanted.  We agreed upon a price ($300 less than what was listed on the internet plus they fix the scratch on the dashboard/trim).  To make a long story short.  After we had agreed upon the price and started the paperwork, James comes back to tell me that the cosmetic fix to the dashboard would cost $150 and his sales manager didn't want to pay for it (after we already agreed upon a price and started the paperwork).  A long story short.  I agreed to pay the $75 he asked to get the scratch fixed as I had already invested too much time at the dealership.  I have to make two more vehicle purchases in 2015 and will not even consider Stonebriar.  It is not about the money.  It is about agreeing on the price and then coming back (wasting my valuable time) and trying to get another $150 out of me after an agreement was complete.  Moral of the story, $75 cost the dealership the possibility of 2 additional purchases and winning my business for life (I have to purchase at least 2 vehicles a year for my business).  But now, I am going to tell everyone I know the $75 story and not recommend Stonebriar Chevrolet to anyone.  As a matter of fact, I will go out of my way to share the story.  It is just human nature,  You have to take care of the customer.  A great lesson I will share with my sales team back at my company.  ",1,14
621,21-Feb-17,"Priced a car on internet $9,225. Drove it and Really liked it and salesman said he could do ""$8,000 out the door"". Go inside and the priced jump to $10,225. They then bring this sheet to me with a bunch of numbers with final price $9,500. Manager tried to explain that $10,225 was the starting price and the internet price was a special. No where on their little sheet did it show a $1,000 special discount. It was a lot of talk trying to get ME to understand why they do it that way. I crossed out $10,225 and wrote in $9,225 and said we'll start from there. Manager goes back and comes back with $9,000 and that's the ""lowest"" they could go. I was going to take them up on their offer to let me take it for a few hours to let my daughter drive it. The more I thought about it the more irritated  I became so I left. I then get original salesman texting me telling me they'd take $8600 even though they weren't making anything on it. So what happened to ""that's the lowest they would take"". He tells me GM was upset that salesman ""let me leave"" so they were offering me this low price just to keep my business. This is the reason I don't like buying used cars from a dealership. I told salesman I wanted their price upfront and I didn't want all the back and forth games. I guess he didn't hear that. If they  would have called and said ""$8,000 out the door"" I'd probably be driving it today. ",1,16
650,02-Jul-19,"I found a vehicle I liked and set up an appointment. Drove it and agreed to pay the asking price. no haggling or talking them down. When it came time to sign, they added over $4000 before TTL to the price and refused to sell the vehicle for the advertised price. It is a bait and switch. They never planned to sell it for the advertised price and were simply driving traffic to the store. Horrible. ",1,17
709,01-Mar-13,"Got a call from our salesman and told us he had what we were looking for and if we could come and see it.  I took a half day vacation and went there which was very far but he said it would be worth the trip.  I took my husband who is handicaped and it is very hard to get him around but if he had what he promised and a good deal as it is end of the month so they would be very aggressive to make us the best deal around..  When we arrived not only did he not have the vehicle he said he had but then tried to sell us another vehicle we really did not want.  He said he could get us a great deal so I asked what the price was and he would not give us a number just that they would work with us on it.  That sent some red flags because I want to know that informaion before we start serious discussions.  He never would tell us and sent in the finance man and he said it was $27,999 and then would not give us a fair price on our trade in.  When I got home I went online and looked up the vehicle and it was listed for only $23,949 so he tried to add an extra four grand to the price. Before he sent in the finance man I asked our salesman to look up the price on his smart phone and he said he could not find it listed which was a lie.  I could not beleive that they would not give us any prices on any vehicles only that they would work with us.  I feel we were brought in on false pretense and he never had the vehicle he said he did.  Did he think we would not look up the price to see if we were being treated fairly?  Very dishonest and I will never deal with that company and will advise everyone I know to stay away.  Any dealership that would try to sell a vehicle for an extra $4,000 above listed price just because you did not know that information before hand is crook.",1,17
711,20-Feb-13,"Went to buy a used truck cash in hand. After seabolt meet me out in the parking lot he said that he had some trucks in the bullpin. After picking a few truck and set on one we made a deal. The next day I go by to sign paperwork and drive the truck I was told that it couldn't leave the parking lot. Ok then they want me to pay the price of the truck in full before it was even inspected. I said i would put a 500 dollar payment and thats it. After three days they say that this truck has problems. Ok i said then i would like to cancel the deal. The gm calls and says he would call me back and doesn't. I go to the dealer and i cant get a refund until tomorrow due to the business center being close. Then the seabolt guy says to leave him the receipt and he will get it for me and i can pick it up tomorrow. Over all this was a very shady deal, they want money for a vehicle that you cant drive and then they dont want to give you your money back. Through all just a bunch of lies. I will never recommend this place to anyone and if you go there be ready to give up your money and get no service. Its is sad to know that the gm or managers dont even care on what is going on.",1,17

819,24-Dec-18,They did not give the advertised price. The internet said one price but they were not willing to start off at that price. The people were friendly but the salesperson we had an appointment with did not show up until hours later. Someone else had to help us. We were not impressed by this or the games they played with the price. We were given the wrong manual for the car but they have offered to correct this issue so that shows they are willing to correct their mistakes. ,1,18
823,14-Nov-18,"I would not recommend buying a car from here.  They mislead with low advertised prices and then tack on a bunch of nonsense fees for ""services"" you can't redeem.

827,07-Nov-18,"I came to Gulfgate with my debit card out ready to purchase a vehicle.  After the test drive I was even more convinced to buy.  However, the price sheet brought back to me was roughly $3500 more than the price advertised online (which is why I came to your dealership...the advertised price).  Jaron explained the warranty that was added to the car, he also mentioned it was a way for the dealership to recoup some of the labor cost for prepping the vehicle.  After I told him I was not going to pay more than the advertised price, he got his manager.  His manager confirmed that he would not sell the car for less than the elevated warranty price.

After the director's departure, I continued discussions with Jaron, I expressed my displeasure of the bait and switch tactic.  Jaron began to tell me I was a bad consumer because if I didn't pay the elevated price I was preventing him from supporting his daughter.  This was the absolute worst sales tactic I have ever seen.

At this point I walked out of the Used Car building and went straight to NEw Car building asking for the GM.  I met a gentleman named, I believe his name was Carl, whom I explained my entire experience with.  HE left me for a minute, I assume to speak with Jaron and his team.  The GM returned and honored the advertised price.  I left with the vehicle I wanted.

I absolutely love the car.  I am less than thrilled about what I had to go through to purchase it.

I will say the Finance Manager I dealt with was very nice and very friendly.",1,18
835,04-Oct-18,"I spoke with a salesman over the phone before driving to the dealership. I was told the online price was definitely the correct sales price on the second phone call. Upon trying to close the deal, I was handed a buyers agreement that showed the price of the car 2400 more than what I was originally told plus an additional 1300 in ""ads"", which I was also never informed about. After walking out, the sales manager and salesman came out to my car to get me to come back in so they could ""attempt"" to honor their online advertised price. After another 20 minutes of wasting my time, the salesman and finance manager came to me with another buyers agreement, this time only about 1000 over what they had originally quoted me over the phone. Needless to say I didn't buy the car. No trade in, came to dealer with USAA approved financing, and somehow they couldn't honor their own printed/advertised online price!! The salesman was friendly and really easy to talk to, and I don't blame him for this.

854,22-Aug-18,"I have been inquiring on two cars for the past week and a half I got the information and the listing price on the cars from an online site. I made a fair offer on the car. I was told my offer was to low and that the price on the car was about 5,000 more than the listing price. I asked why when it was listed for the amount 5,000 less. After that the salesman no longer responded. I then reached out to the dealership again and inquired about the same vehicle with another salesman. We workout a price and he seems willing to sell it for that amount. He then proceeds to tell me that for this specific car they are not accepting outside financing. When I had been inquiring about this car for the past week and a half. Telling the salesman I was waiting on my pre approval through my bank. Of course the not accepting outside financing was not stated then. I then proceed to wait and see what happened. I was not contacted or followed up by any of the three salesman I talked to. I clearly wanted to work out something and drive off the lot with the specific car I was inquiring about. All I got were excuses as to why I could not buy the car. I called again today and asked about the same car and added another one I was interested in. I called they gave me the listing price and told me they would call me back to work out a deal. Of course I have not been called back. Terrible business. Terrible salesman. I offered to buy the car and I was told no. Spoke to at least 5-6 people about the same car and no one was willing to even try and sell it. Basically got ignored. ",1,18
877,26-May-18,"We purchased a ‘17 Infiniti Q50.  Advertised price was $22,499. When we we sat down with the salesman, the price increased to $30k as he tried add certified cost of $5k. Told him we didn’t want that and deducted it which still increased the price by $865. Said he couldn’t remove the cost of security “etching”. Our salesman Xavian consulted with his sales manager and the sales manager became verbally assaultive towards him. We could hear the sales manager fussing at Xavian which was totally unprofessional. Xavian did his job well, but the sales manager should be fired!

The next day I called the dealership and let them know why was the sale price change from $19,800 to $22,800 and they stated because there was a mandatory warranty that I had to purchase. I advised them that I didn't want that warranty and they told me it was mandatory or else they weren't going to be able to honor the Internet price. I let them know that they can't force me to purchase a warranty or service contract if I don't want to and they simply stated that it was too late I already agreed and signed the contract. I know it was my fault for not verifying the numbers on the contract but this dealership operates with deceptive practices in order to increase their profits and they hide everything from you and just make you sign really quick.

1010,21-Nov-11,"This was my worst experience ever buying a car.  I have never paid msrp for a vehicle ever.  I went in asking to pay 21-22k for a 2012 new jeep wrangler.  I was clear that was all I wanted to pay and if they couldn't do that as msrp is 25k then we could save each other some time. The salesman talked to finance and they said I should go for a test drive.  When we came back the salesman had me sign a form saying that if I got my price, then I would buy that night.  I had no problem with it.  They then gave me a menu of prices.  They tried to decrease my payments over a longer period of time which would have still got them msrp or more.  I said no.

The salesman went back and forth with finance and then had me sign another form with 25k listed again.  I said why do you keep writing that number down. He said don't worry it will change later they just have to put that number down so he can get it past the owner and that isn't the price and it will change. At this point, I felt like I needed a shower as this felt like a very dirty deal.

They then trotted out more new numbers.  At this point I wasn't sure when the number would change to the 21-22k. Long story short it never did.  I think I got about 700 dollars off msrp after they claimed they are only making 350 dollars on the deal and that they had to make sure the owner didn't see the paperwork.  I don't think the owner would be that upset considering they then advertised a sales event five days later.

I took my husband who is handicaped and it is very hard to get him around but if he had what he promised and a good deal as it is end of the month so they would be very aggressive to make us the best deal around..  When we arrived not only did he not have the vehicle he said he had but then tried to sell us another vehicle we really did not want.  He said he could get us a great deal so I asked what the price was and he would not give us a number just that they would work with us on it.  That sent some red flags because I want to know that informaion before we start serious discussions.  He never would tell us and sent in the finance man and he said it was $27,999 and then would not give us a fair price on our trade in.  When I got home I went online and looked up the vehicle and it was listed for only $23,949 so he tried to add an extra four grand to the price. Before he sent in the finance man I asked our salesman to look up the price on his smart phone and he said he could not find it listed which was a lie.  I could not beleive that they would not give us any prices on any vehicles only that they would work with us.  I feel we were brought in on false pretense and he never had the vehicle he said he did.  Did he think we would not look up the price to see if we were being treated fairly?

I go to the dealer and i cant get a refund until tomorrow due to the business center being close. Then the seabolt guy says to leave him the receipt and he will get it for me and i can pick it up tomorrow.

However, the price sheet brought back to me was roughly $3500 more than the price advertised online (which is why I came to your dealership...the advertised price).  Jaron explained the warranty that was added to the car, he also mentioned it was a way for the dealership to recoup some of the labor cost for prepping the vehicle.  After I told him I was not going to pay more than the advertised price, he got his manager.  His manager confirmed that he would not sell the car for less than the elevated warranty price.

After the director's departure, I continued discussions with Jaron, I expressed my displeasure of the bait and switch tactic.  Jaron began to tell me I was a bad consumer because if I didn't pay the elevated price I was preventing him from supporting his daughter.  This was the absolute worst sales tactic I have ever seen.

At this point I walked out of the Used Car building and went straight to NEw Car building asking for the GM.  I met a gentleman named, I believe his name was Carl, whom I explained my entire experience with.  HE left me for a minute, I assume to speak with Jaron and his team.  The GM returned and honored the advertised price.  I left with the vehicle I wanted.

After walking out, the sales manager and salesman came out to my car to get me to come back in so they could ""attempt"" to honor their online advertised price. After another 20 minutes of wasting my time, the salesman and finance manager came to me with another buyers agreement, this time only about 1000 over what they had originally quoted me over the phone. Needless to say I didn't buy the car. No trade in, came to dealer with USAA approved financing, and somehow they couldn't honor their own printed/advertised online price!!

I clearly wanted to work out something and drive off the lot with the specific car I was inquiring about. All I got were excuses as to why I could not buy the car. I called again today and asked about the same car and added another one I was interested in. I called they gave me the listing price and told me they would call me back to work out a deal. Of course I have not been called back. Terrible business. Terrible salesman. I offered to buy the car and I was told no.

When I asked them to remove the trade-in from negotiations, they actually refused to do the deal altogether unless I traded in because they would lose money at their advertised price plus the $1,800.  They played all sorts of games (back to the manager 4 times) that I thought dealers gave up in the dark ages. I guess they thought we had spent so much time we would not go elsewhere.

Then they had the gall to say all dealers do the same thing and include unadvertised add-ons like they do.

That was the biggest lie. We went to Covert at 183 and got a price less than Maxwells advertised teaser price (with the $1,800 dealer add-ons). No games (back and forth to the manager). Picked our truck and closed the deal in 90 minutes.

1521,27-Jun-15,"First off, I do not write many bad reviews. But this experience was my worst at a dealer. Here is the experience. I was very specifically looking for the 50th anniversary Mustang. They had two. The sales rep was standing by the car and looked at me with a strange look as I checked to see if it was unlocked. It was locked and my wife asked to see it. The sales rep responded with ""its locked"". Not an offer the get the Key. He walked away a bit before I stopped him and said, please go get the key so that I may see the inside of this vehicle. He did oblige at that moment. NOW, we test drive, no problems. Unfortunately I know far more about the vehicle that the person trying to sell me the car. So I can not ask my questions. Again, I can let that slide, they don't make a lot of money and cant know it all. This particular car was on Autotrader from the dealer and the dealers website. I checked both before I got there. The window still say 30K over sticker and I confirmed that would not be there based on the fact the vehicle was on special at sticker price. Again, I am fine here. Now I say, I will take the car. The rep then comes back after a manager told them to add a markup even though it was advertised at sticker. They tried to convince me that I had to pay a markup above their advertised price that was on their site and on auto trader. After some banter, I told them I am leaving as it is dishonest. Magically, now they can sell it at the advertised price.... I am not an uniformed shopper, so it is disappointing that the dealer would bully and lie directly to my face like that and to also have zero respect for the customer to begin with as they come to see the vehicle. I will drive to Houston before I would confidently give this dealer my business. ",1,27

Other dealerships offer the vehicle at list price (already a big profit for the dealership) and don't seem to need to price gouge/take advantage of their customers.

1573,11-May-15,"I do not recommend any Leif Johnson Location - well at the very least not the Leif Johnson Superstore North (Austin, TX). Eric Smith and Mary Stacey are both crooked and I will tell you why.
I made a purchase there last month, they firstly attempted to justify giving $3,500 less than the Kelly Blue Book suggested saying, ""this is what the book value is, $12,000 is all your car is worth"". It is interesting to me that I got a whole lot more than that for it else where!! 
Then I went to purchase a used vehicle without trading in my own vehicle from them that same day. Eric Smith, an employee there, took over the sale instead of the newbie salesman that had been helping us and it went like this:
The web advertised price was $28,634 and I confirmed this before leaving for their location 120 miles away form our home. Once I accepted to take the vehicle, Eric tried to list out the warranty and total costs on a paper which reflected the sales price of the vehicle to be $28,999. I caught this change and said I would not accept this amount as it was not what was advertised or marketed to me. He tried to pull a fast one by saying, ""Oh the difference is the LoJack system we install on all our cars and it can't be uninstalled, it has a $500 value and you will get this back in insurance savings"" (our insurance does not offer any such thing BTW). I told him to either remove it or change the price or I was leaving without the vehicle. He 'changed' the price to $28,799 but still didn't change it to the advertised price. I reckon he thought I didn't catch on but i did and didn't say anything just to see if he would pull it off.

1617,02-Jun-20,"Date line 5/22/2020 I called about a 2016 CPO Ford Escape that Grapevine Ford had advertised. Was contacted immediately and they went through their spill about how if I would fill out a credit app they would come of the price $500 even though I had told them is was a cash deal. Was told they are not a front of house dealership and did not do cash discounts. Now I was quoted $18,800+- for the car they had advertised for $16500.  I asked for an explanation and the oh so smart salesman said it included some anti theft gimmick that was $500 plus and an extra key that was $500 plus because there was only one with the car, also ttl for Oklahoma that he said was required by them to include at 4 1/2 %, which I knew was a lie. There was still $700 dollars difference in their so called out the door price, come to find out he had also tried to include dealer finance fees or some other nonsense. Finally he says $16,183.33 which I agreed to and made sure it would include a 2nd key which magically appeared while on the phone. He said ""i have it right here in my hand."" So, reluctantly, I agree to drive down the next morning and meet at 9 am and if everything checks out would make the deal. I should have known better! Get there and drive the car which was advertised as having lane assist and the brake assist and back up alarms all features that I wanted for my daughter. Thought it was me and that I had not activated features so, when I returned to dealer and asked how to activate. He gets in and fumbles around not saying anything except let me printout the window sticker and he took off to his office, brought it back and started off on how rare this gem of a car was to have traction control?!? I asked again about the 
lane assist and other safety features. He says oh, this car does not have those features, they are only available on 2020 models! I said your internet ad states that it does, so he tells me, ""Well I dont write those ads."" 
Then totally exasperated I walk out as he is saying ""We have 2020's."" Wow, what a piece of work, I am stunned that dealerships like this exist and this was my first and last experience with Grapevine Ford. I have always bought from Huffines in Corinth Classic in Sherman and always treated with respect and make transparent deals. Oh, and he also said they have the lowest priced dealer ad ons in the metroplex, bragging rights??? Part of the double talk I have  left out for times sake that were just as bogus as the rest. Anyway, buyer beware as they always say! Not going to mention the assistant sales managers name, but you know who you are, I was not your sucker customer of the day.  Buyer's please know what you are getting into on these deals, always ask for a full disclosure of fees and there close to 100% profit add ons are a hoax.
 The absolute worst part of this is they have these huge floor displays of the 10 rules of ethics, yeah right! By the way, those $500 keys are usually around $200 retail at honest dealerships and can be had all day online for $100.

I know going to a dealership is usually not a fun experience and they all want to get as much money out of you as possible but this place is by far the worst. First off they put amazing prices on their website for vehicles and once you call or actually go to the dealership to check it out the car is either "" just sold this past week"" or they will make up a fee and add a ridiculous amount of money to it. Oh and if your wanting to trade your car in, don't expect to get anything Kelly Blue Book, NADA, or any other online website thinks the trade in value is. Apparently they just make their own price up for that too. So, I went in there to take a look at a new 2018 mustang and trade my 2014 mustang in which has 55,000 miles, only been washed by hand, only used royal purple oil for oil changes, and I put close to $1,000 into it putting custom leather seat covers in it, adding weather tech floor mats, and tinted the windows with a lifetime guarantee. They wanted to give me $8,500 for trading it in. I told the sales rep I looked it up on Kelly Blue Book and it says the trade in value is $11,059 not including the money I put in it. He said KBB is a western company and that they use NADA. So, I looked up the NADA trade in value. The NADA clean trade in value is $11,575. Then, I was talking to a sales manager trying to negotiate a price and I told him about the NADA trade in value, and no joke he tells me they don’t use NADA to look at trade in values, they use this other website. I can’t remember what that site was called. To make this story short, we couldn't come to agreement on the trade in or the final price of the car. Two days later, I look online and find a New 2018 Ford Raptor at the same dealership for $51,080. Amazing price right! So when I called them and tried to see if they still have it in stock and see what the price was, the person I talked to said there was not any sale reps in the dealership at the moment and they would call me back as soon as one comes in. This was at 8:15 am they open at 7:00 am. That seemed kind of fishy to me.  So I had a friend of mine call them 5 minutes later, and guess who answers, a sales rep. He told my friend the vehicle is in stock, but you need to add a $10,000 fee to the MSRP sticker price, so the final price is $61,000. 45 minutes later a female sales rep gave me a call. This sales rep said the vehicle is in stock but you have to add $15,000 to the MSRP sticker price. I said why do you have to add $15,000? And no lie, she stuttered and actually took a while to come up with an excuse as to why they add that much to it. She then asked me if I wanted to come see it and I said I only wanted to come see it if I can get it for the price you advertised on your website. She then said, “Ya we can’t sell it to you for that price"". I then texted the sticker for the vehicle to the sales rep I talked to about the mustang. He texted me back saying, ""yes that vehicle is in stock"". I then texted him if he wanted to sell a truck today and sell me for the price on their website and on the sticker then I will come up there and purchase it that day. You probably guessed it he never texted me back. So if you want some advice, I would not go to this dealership. All they do is play games, make up numbers, and try to screw people over. If you see a good price online for this dealership just add a minimum of $10,000 to it and that’s the real price. Also, I would never trade my car into this place. Expect to get a couple thousand dollars less than what the trade in value should be.",1,30
1676,01-Dec-16,"The salesman picked out a car from inventory and said he could trade for it.  We negotiated on the car and agreed on a price.  The sales manager came in and took a little more off the top and closed the deal.  He assured me they secured the trade and to come pick it up in 2 days.

When I got there to take delivery I discovered on my own they didn't get the right car.  I asked and they said it was, I referred back to our paper work and showed them it was not.  The sales manager Jeremy found out he could not trade for the car I wanted and he switched vehicles on our final offer paper and my final contract and paper work.  At no point during this process did they tell us they swapped cars.

After all this they wanted me to promise I would give them perfect marks on my survey they sent me.  All they care about is their survey.  Other dealerships want honest feedback on how they are doing, not perfect marks to hide their flaws.

Lies and lies after and I cancelled the deal.  ",1,30
1727,27-Jul-12,"First off, I was very pleased with my sales associate, Robert Miller. He helped my pregnant wife and I find the right vehicle for our growing family. He was very knowledgeable and easy to work with. I am pleased with the vehicle that we decided upon, the 2013 Ford Explorer. My issue is with the games they play to try to make money at Grapevine Ford Lincoln. I was initially quoted a price of roughly $39600 on my vehicle even after telling them several times that my budget was to stay below $35000. After haggling for 2+ hours to get the price to something I could live with, I was told that it would be just a few minutes until I would be ushered back to the finance guy, Brian Mainard. We sat there waiting for over an hour before anyone came by and inquired as to what we were doing. Once we got back to Brian's office, he pitched us 15 kinds of insurance for the vehicle, all sending the total cost well past my budget price. After I told Brian I wanted NONE of the extras he was trying to sell me, he put his sleazy car salesman hat on and ""worked the numbers."" He said he would keep my payments the same and offer me the extra services. I thought ""great,"" I'm getting these services for free. Essentially he lowered my interest rate, but charged my for the price of the extra insurance, keeping my payments close to the same, but again sending the total price well past the price we had shaken hands on several hours earlier. My question is, if he has the power to reduce interest rate with the wave of his hand, which was half of what he first quoted me, then why wasn't I offered the lower interest rate in the first place? I'll tell you why, because they only care about the bottom line and nothing about helping the customer into the right vehicle for the right price. Here is the kicker! Once I got home I searched cars.com, for similar Explorers, which I had done several time while researching what vehicle I wanted. Lo and behold our Explorer was on there. I must have missed it when searching before. The kicker is that the list price on the vehicle on the internet was only $400 more than what we finally agreed upon, $4000 less than the $39600 I was originally quoted. That would have been a great starting point! I hope you have learned something from this review, I know I have. Bottom line, I will never again deal with Grapevine Ford Lincoln and Brian Mainard!",1,30

He checked car came back and verified it had window tinting and alarm along with all features listed. After I informed him I was on the way there, my husband and I drove there. Upon entering another man named Mark said he would help me and we went on a test drive. We came back in and he showed us the price $299 more then the website price Trent had verified. We were told they had to add on for window tinting and the website price had accidentally been marked a $1000 too low but they would give it to me with an extra $299.

1735,01-Jun-10,"Was at that the dealership for an hour and a half before I even got the price on the vehicle I was looking at (rule of thumb, if you're in the business of selling you might want to know the prices). The price once i did get it was extremely high. After haggling for another 2 hours i got them down to what they called their ""absolute lowest"" price they could do and we parted ways from there. I had a friend call the next morning inquiring about the same vehicle and they gave her the price I had just spent 3 hours to get right off, over the phone. The manager informed me before I left that these deals dont come along very often. Turns out they do, I bought one a day later. It was newer, nicer, fewer miles, certified and less money.

1925,22-Sep-14,"I had a really poor experience at West Point. I believe the name of my salesman was Echo or Etko. I came in to to a 2009 BMW 750LI. It was originally listed on Ebay for 29k, a vehicle with 50k miles. I found that to be the best bargain online and I called in immediately. I originally spoke to a gentleman name Jay and he was very helpful and informative. However my schedule and his conflicted and unfortunately had to deal with Echo. I test drove the vehicle, the BMW had a some type of battery issue and was less than a perfect ride. Even still I figured we can work out a deal, get some of those minor issue corrected and still drive home with a new car. 

Upon working the deal Echo attempted to sell the car to me for about $5000 more than what the advertised price was even AFTER I told him the special. He goes back and comes back and still tries to sell it to me for about $2000 MORE than what the advertised price was and basically write the original arrangement off claiming that whoever listed it for so cheap ""could loose their job"". I was less than amused.

When asked if I could take the BMW to a BMW dealership and have it checked out he said I would have to wait until monday and if there is any other issues that they will not be willing to fix it or address it. 

It was very clear than when he realized he was not going to be making nearly as much on the deal as he hoped he became very short, impatient and downright rude. I asked about warranty and he threw some number at me and wouldnt let me speak to a manager. I really wish I wouldve seen Jay that day and maybe things wouldve been different. ",1,37

2014,29-Mar-17,"Test drove a new Odyssey and had great service. After reviewing all the used inventory online, I analyzed KBB and Car Gurus, and I went in to see a specific used 2014. We were not allowed to see the car closely because it was in the workshop--the sales person did see the car more closely. The sales person let us know we should put a deposit on the car if we wanted to hold the option once it was cleaned up. We agreed. Then he told us we needed to decide on a price. I was surprised but based on all the research I had done, it was only $300 above my target price. I asked for a break and they said no. Still an okay deal, so I signed the price. 1 minute after I sign they say that now we can see the car but that the mileage was wrong--instead of 10k, it is 23k. I was disappointed, the low mileage was a key reason I was interested. KBB suggests that the price difference for that mileage should be a little more than $1300. Bait and switch. I asked to discuss if there was something they could do since our deal was based on very different mileage. They pulled the classic ""I'll ask my manager, oh wait, he says no"". The manager, Billy Watson came out and said, that the error that was mysteriously in their favor, was an accident and that I should expect him to compromise (even though the deal the sales person and I had agreed on we negotiated under an assumption of less than half the mileage). Billy might be right though, I may have expected a typical employee of Honda (which is a brand I love... or loved) to have compromised or to have behaved with more integrity, but I guess it was naive of me to expect a sale manager that ""accidentally"" posts low mileage which ""accidentally"" accrues to his favor and only reveals the information 1-minute after the price negotiation is finished to have compromised.",1,40

I called them and was told that it was a fee that covered ""getting the car ready for sale"". So I'm not sure what they did but it took $1k to get a 2017 ready to be sold. 

I informed the manager that this fee was not conveyed to me by the salesman but to no avail. I returned the car and advise anyone looking to purchase from this dealer to watch out for these sleaze xxxxx. You will never get a car from this dealer at or below the advertised or sticker price.

We test drove a car yesterday. Before we left , Marissa, the Manager, stated that they made a mistake on the price and that the price would increase in 48 hours. I called back in less than 24 hours and they said the price already went up $2,000 and that they would not honor the price they quoted when I test drove the car. When I spoke to the salesman about it, he said the Manager told me 24 hours (which she did not, as my daughter heard her also and I even wrote it down) and that the car was just on sale at the time I looked at it. Either way, it's not my problem if they made a mistake on the price, plus I called back even before 24 hours was up, so their argument is full of it.

I have dealt with numerous dealerships from Houston to San Antonio and Dallas in the past year, as I recently bought a new car and have been looking for a used car for my child for several months. I know car salesmen don't have the best reputation, but this one goes far beyond their usual deceptive practices.

I recently bought the used car and my experience was very bad and I dont have any option to quit in middle of the process as I already singed the paper work. I have seen the used car and did the test drive, i told sales person that there are some good signs of scratches and paint issue on the car. Sales person told that 'no problem, i will take care of them' and after I sign the paper and I asked him can you fix those issues you committed and I am surprised that sales person saying that 'we will not able to fix them and do anything with them'... This is the first time I am seeing such a core profession marketing sales person which behaves completely different before and after signing the papers

Also i approached them with Internet price and in Internet nothing was mentioned extra on top of Internet price. After I decided to buy then sales person given the car price as Internet Price + added Service Fee (Service Fee means all lubricant oil changes on the car + they said Gillman will give life time engine warranty for that they will charge extra $998 on top of Internet price(this was not mentioned on the internet)...So i negotiated the final price as same as Internet price (i am hoping that my price will include life time engine warranty) and after signing he said i will NOT get any warranty as I declined that....But i have not declined and I have negotiated the final price which includes warranty...... Finally I realized that they simply add extra $998 and every customer negotiate and  even after customer negotiate the price still they will get as the internet price what they offered ...customer simply loosing money and they are getting what they initially quoted ($0 on negotiation), so they completely cheated me on the price.

One more catch on life time engine warranty on all used cars means you have to come to their service center and do all regular services and if you miss one service then this life time engine warranty will not work...

My bad was i really not noticed some major issues on the car like windshield crack with temporary fix on it(I  noticed when driving the car back to home) and some of the dashboard switches are very bad...Even I have not called and asked them on these issues because I don't think they will respond....

My friends, be cautions while talking/dealing with these guys...

Lawrence manager of sales department. He is so arrogant and full of his ego. Through out our conversation, he was bragging about his ""25"" years of experience and how Gillman Honda is the biggest dealer. When I mentioned stopping by John Eagle Honda for price comparison as being straight forward and honest person. He totally refused to give me any price for 2015 Honda Accord Sport. 

How can you expect someone to buy anything without them knowing the price. I asked him to whether he ever purchased a pair of paints from a shopping mall without  knowing a price for them. He said no. Then I asked him how can you expect me to buy a twenty seven thousand dollars of car without knowing the price. 

He got tipped off when I mentioned to him John Eagle Honda. He said John Eagle Honda were very small and low class dealer than Gillman Honda. 

He was rude, argumentative, unprofessional and mean. I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE GO TO GILLMAN HONDA EVER!!!!! OR AT LEAST NOT TO DEAL WITH THE MANAGER LAWRENCE. 

Lawrence ""the manager"" full or his ego and arrogance should learn from his juniors sales associates. This is what happens sometimes to some people when their little job get to their head. This is what exactly took place. You are treated in Burger King better than they way how Gillman treated me. 

The sales consultant Mr. Reynaldo M. was excellent. Manager Lawrence should learn from rookie and honest sales consultant Reynaldo.

2111,30-Jan-18,"We went to this dealership to buy an Odyssey Touring. We did a test drive and finally got to the point of negotiating price. For the whole negotiation, we were talking about out of the door (OTD) price without any trade-in or anything. In addition, we never mentioned about how much we wanted to put down for down payment. We got the the OTD price of $43,000. Then we go to finance office. Everything went fine up until the point we signed the payment paper. We agreed to put down $10,000 as our down payment which means that we will finance $33,000. But NO, on the paper, the amount we needed to finance was $35,000. Turned out, from the beginning, they had put $2,000 as my down payment without my knowledge. Basically, their PRICE WAS $45,000, not $43,000 which I was led to believe. This came at a surprise to my salesman too because as I said, we negotiated the car’s price without any down payment in mind. Moreover, when presenting the finance paper to us, instead of showing, explaining, and checking everything on it (ex: interest rate, down payment, amount finance…), the finance guy just went straight up to the monthly amount and tell us to put initial on it, trying to rush through the paper. If we haven’t caught that, we would of buy that car for $45,000 and thinking it was only $43,000. The final straw that make me writing this is when the finance guy told me that that was never his fault, that $2,000 was on the paper from the beginning and I did not read it (my thought: even your staff did not see this, and you still had to courage to blame it on me????). I understand that dealerships need to make their money somewhere, either car price, finance, extended warranties, or accessories; which is totally acceptable; but what I cannot tolerate is when they are trying to SCAM their customers. Yes, I used the word “SCAM.” Their way of doing business is highly UNETHICAL. After reading my review and you still want to give this dealership a try, by all means, be my guess. At least, keeping my experience in mind and I hope you get a good deal from them. My final warning: EXTREMELY CAREFUL WITH THIS DEALERSHIP!!!!

There was no retractable ad and since I worked in retail for 40 years, we had to sell an item for the advertised price.  Also he said only had car for 2 days and internet manager stated that you had the car for a long time.  Manager said he would sell for $17,500 and I agreed, then when I saw contract, it had Dealer fee $299.  I did not ask for it and Kevin said it is on every car sold, but I was never explained this before I received the contract.  I do not agree with this policy.  ",1,44

They will give you a quote over the phone and then you will never get the price they quoted you. Internet sales team is a real joke. Also they load vehicles with bunch of overpriced, ugly looking accessories which they also try to add to the price and  which makes it 1500-2500 more than a sticker price. Wheel locks that Honda sells for $65 (when you can find aftermarket for $25) in Lute Riley will cost you $295. Same factor you can apply to everything else they sell.

He kept pushing me to see cars that were way above my price range, and was extremely rude after I went and looked at cheaper vehicles on the lot, and told him which vehicle I wanted.  He told me a price and my payments, but whe I got into the finance office, he had added 2k to the selling price, calling it dealer fees.

2216,10-May-20,"Beware of Hidden fees!!! BAIT & SWITCH!
The price they listed on their website is not what they will quote you in person! I also used the USAA TrueCar app which gives Military discount price but they don’t follow it. What is the point of having those apps as a tool for car buying guide if dealership doesn’t follow it. The salesman and manager will always find a way to make an excuse and blame something like inaccurate prices on USAA TrueCar app that promises accuracy and instant price breakdown on vehicles from dealership that they partnered with. I mean c’mon it’s 2020, stop living like it’s 1985! People can find the answer over the internet nowadays and compare. It’s disappointing and that they treat people like veteran customers with a whopping extra $2100 on the top of a used car valued under $15k!!! By the law, consumers only pay for Tax, Title, and License (registration). Document fees should be at the maximum of $150. I was told that the $2100 is to recoup the cost for the reconditioning of the vehicle and when I checked the battery the sticker was dated 06/18 which is 2 years old!!! Make sure y’all check the battery stickers for date (warranty) and tires are stamped with dates because that’s how manufacturers keep track of the warranty! Don’t let dealership ripoff honest people and don’t let Honda Burleson take your hard earned money. Only pay for what is listed on the website and the Actual Vehicle Value. Any extras like tint, wheel locks, and etc are not required to pay by the law! Dealership installed items are gimmicks! I understand the work that is done but if they are going to charge me extra $2100 for reconditioning then why they didn’t even fix the bumper damage of the car. The only thing that is relevant to the repairs are the new tires and that’s it! When I talked to the manager I told him that I don’t want to pay for dealership fee $2100 because it’s not listed on their website. They will try to argue and show you the generic message (footnotes*) thinking they can somehow make you believe that you are required to pay extra because you are stupid enough not to understand the internet price and basic math! Stop making excuses, be fair and honest to customers. Don’t even mention transparency if you can’t itemized the items for charging extra $2100. It’s a xxxx used car! Not an antique. Car buying experience should be fun but my salesman asks me questions like I’m a dollar sign! Be knowledgeable on the product and explain the functionality of the vehicle before proceeding with the price and then don’t go to your manager when you can’t decide about the final price because you don’t make the finance decisions! You’re a salesman for a reason so earn your title, managers manages employees and not customers! I can’t even imagine how they make sales in new car department...

2217,12-Mar-20,"The price they advertise online is not what they quote you in person.  We found one of their used cars online and went in to look at it.  I knew there would be extra fees for TTL, but after test driving it we were told the actual price was about $5,000 higher than what it was listed for.  The salesman explained that the additional cost was for the reconditioning fee for work they did on the car to get it ready to sell.  I can understand there being work that needs to be done on the cars and the dealership wanting to recoup that cost.  My issue is why not include that in the advertised price. When we asked our salesman about this he said that no dealership includes that extra cost in their advertised price and if Burleson Honda did no one would come look at their cars because they would be advertised for higher than other dealerships around. I don't know how accurate that statement is.  We felt very deceived.  The added amount took the price out of our budget.   After the back and forth drama that occurs in buying cars they did come down on their price some but we still paid about $2,000 over the advertised price.  Looking back I wish we had got up and walked out but we were in a real crunch with needing a new car.  It just leaves me wondering what else they were deceptive about.  Did they really do the work they claim they did?   As we are starting to look for another used car for my husband we'll look elsewhere since this dealship was deceptive with us.

2243,02-May-16,"I had been following their inventory for some time and reading their great reviews, hoping this is where I'd buy the car for my soon to be 16 year old daughter.  
I sent an inquiry on a CPO car on their lot and was promptly replied by Carl R.  Through emails I discussed with him that I was very busy at work and with the kids, but that I was very interested in this certain car.  I verified that it was in fact a CPO car, mostly due to another individuals review that she was sold a car believed to be CPO and was not (you can read that review here on Dealer Rater as well), in which he assured me it would be.  So I stated that I was bringing my own funding and wanted the full price of the vehicle so that I could be prepared and ready to go if the car was to my liking.  Here is when the bomb dropped for me, nearly $2000 was being charge above and beyond the internet pricing for ""Certification"" fees.  Not only is this a ridiculous mark up to call the car ""CPO"", but even more ridiculous on a 4 year old car!!!  I currently own a car very similar to the one I inquired about and could not believe what the total price of their car was to be, the TRUE price, not the one advertised.  Carl assured me they would not lose my business over ""a couple of hundred dollars"", his words.  Well maybe not over a couple of hundred, but most surely over 2 grand!!!  No wonder the majority of people are upside down on their car loans, if they are getting suckered into this kind of car buying!",1,46

I had received a phone call from the salesman saying that, If I financed my vehicle through Hyundai that they would lower my previously quoted price by $1500. We agreed upon a final ""drive out"" price and I went to the dealership to pick up the car. When I arrived, they told me they did not have the car we agreed upon and wanted to sell me a different vehicle for the agreed upon price but without the agreed upon options. I walked out of the dealership! After a year, I needed another car and thought I would give them another try. Yes, they did almost the exact same thing the second time.

2401,13-Aug-16,"This review is for Exotic Cars of Houston ... North Freeway Hyundai's exotic used car department (?)

Be careful buying a vehicle from these guys out-of-state. It was a very poor experience overall. You'll see the white G63 I bought in the dealer header photo. Paid cash and had nothing but poor communication and lies after the sale. 

Several items were not discussed including dents and engine problems. On top of that the dealer agreed to cover our all-in-price agreed to (taxes, fees, etc) and then backed out of it. I have to take these guys to court now to get a resolution. 

I worked with Matt Blevins. 

In cases like this, it helps to have actual facts and evidence on hand. 

I have, in writing, you agreeing to an all-in-price with no additional fees. As you pointed out, in AZ we don't pay tax with private party sales. I mentioned during the sales process that there was one other G63 from a private party that I was considering buying. You can see why I wanted an all-in-price, so that it was a comparable deal.

In addition to lying about the taxes and failure to disclose issues with the car... Exotic Cars of Houston isn't even incorporated or have a dealer license in the state of Texas (which they are going to hear about).",1,51

We just bought a car from North Freeway Hyundai and it wasn't because we wanted to, it's was because they will take advantage of you just for starting to make a deal with them. Stay away from this dealership, nothing they say can be trusted and they don't care if in the end your an unhappy customer. They will charge you for their advertising, $299 worth will show up on your contract and they won't say a thing about it, unless you call them on it. They took our trade in on a Saturday night and we made a deal on a new car, then noticed the contract was completely wrong so we called them early Monday morning and went back up there to get it strait. When we got there they started acting underhanded so we told them we wanted our car back. They said they already sold it and that we had to take their deal ( no three day grace with these people) they gave us no negotiation. Scott Thomas was the big shot there that likes to make women cry. Save yourself some grief and stay away from this dealership. ",1,51
2426,24-Jun-17,"Here is what happened to me during my purchase of a 2017 Hyundai Sonata at World Car Hyundai in San Antonio, TX. After reading this you should understand why I scored the survey as I did.  On Saturday June 10th my wife and I visited the dealership looking for a 2017 Hyundai Sonata Limited. The sales person greeted us and showed us what was available on the lot. I had gone through Truecar and this is what led me to this dealership. There weren’t a lot of choices available on the Limited model in San Antonio. We found the 2017 Hyundai Sonata Limited 2.0 Turbo and test drove it. We liked the vehicle very much and decided to go forward with the purchase. During the negotiations the dealership presented a price and ultimately we decided on a price $500 less. Everything was set. I was going to pay cash but was told I could save more money if I financed with Hyundai so I did. From the time we agree on a price to the time I actually got the vehicle took approximately 4 hours. Seemed like forever. The financing when through just fine. We scheduled an appointment to have the appearance package added to the vehicle the next week. We drove the vehicle home and thought everything was good.   Three days later I get a call from the finance guy saying I added the wrong vehicle to my insurance. The VIN on the vehicle from the ID card they have does not match what they sold me. I verified that the VIN on the ID card is indeed the vehicle they sold me. Then the finance guy realized they screwed up and did the whole deal on the wrong vehicle. He said I would need to sign all new paperwork. I agree to meet him at a Starbucks halfway between my house and the dealership and sign the correct paperwork. I met him and while I was going through the new paperwork when I can to the document with the total purchase price I noticed the price had increased by $2600. He did NOT tell me this, I’m the one that pointed it out. I said we have a problem. This is not the price we negotiated. He said he understood but the price we negotiated was on a different vehicle. I said that was not my fault. I test drove the vehicle I wanted. And in good faith negotiated the price on that vehicle. He said I would have to drive back to the dealership and speak to the sales manager.   I drove all the way back to the dealership. Spoke with the sales manager and he said the only thing they can do is reduce the price by $500. I said that was unacceptable. They should give me the price we negotiated. It was not my fault that they used pricing on a different vehicle. He accused me of wanting free money. I requested to speak with the General Manager. Gave him my story and he agree to give me $1200 off but not the full $2600 price increase. This whole time neither the Sales Manager or General Manager EVER ONCE apologized to me for what was happening. The salesman we had (Andy Bailey) did apologize but he was the only one. I was in a dilemma. On one hand I wanted to scrape the whole deal and get my trade-in back. But we had the new vehicle for 3 days and I had no idea what had happened to my trade-in. Plus we had been looking for a new vehicle for awhile and had gone to a few dealerships and was so ready for the process to be over.   All said and done, they agree to reduce the total to $1500, but not the full $2600. I agree because I just wanted it to be over. I still feel this was wrong. I believe that World Car should have stood on THEIR mistake and compensated me financially as well as ALL the time it took doing this. They were completely unprofessional (again not Andy Bailey the salesman).   So the next week I take the vehicle in for the appearance package (on a Friday). Was told I would get it back the same day. I got it late the next day and there were scratches on the driver and passenger side window tents which the service guy pointed out to me. So  we set up ANOTHER appointment. I went back the next week and got the windows redone.   All told, I have been to World Car Hyundai 5 times in two weeks. I live 20 miles away.   This is why I scored the survey as I did.

2462,29-Dec-16,"Tonight my wife and I stopped at Sterling Mccall Hyundai to look at a used vehicle we saw advertised on their website. The specific vehicle we were looking for was no longer on the lot, but we did take the time to look at another vehicle.  We were discussing the vehicle when my wife internet searched the specific vehicle on the phone, and the website showed a price for the vehicle set at $8,990.   The dealership had the sticker set at $13,990.  I pointed this out to the sales team, and we even verified the VIN and description of the vehicle on the Website with the one we were looking to buy. They pulled the site up on there desktop and they even reflected the $8,990 price. They told me to ignore that, that it was just a mistake that would be fixed. I told them that since that vehicle is being advertised for that price, that is the price I should receive. They refused this completely, only offering me $300.00 off the sticker price.  We had several discussions about this, the sales manager got involved, and they told me clearly that they could not honor their internet advertised price.",1,53
2470,02-Mar-16,"I went to the dealership based on the online advertised price.  I made contact with a salesperson who was okay via phone but did not have a clue what I wanted when I drove 5 hours to get to the dealership.  I was interested in the Genesis and he offered an Eleantra.  The car that I was interested in had a $15,829 dealer discount and still had the additional $500 military discount according to the website.  That was not the case; the salesperson stated that the dealer options add-on package was more expensive than the others (normally $2100 that was not advertised online either) on that particular car.  I asked why and he answered that he was not sure the reason for it.  They also wanted to really give me a very low trade-in value for my car.  Overall, terrible experience that really makes you think that dealerships are dishonest and only care about making money.  It is a business to make money but the least they can do is tell the truth to the customer and have knowledgeable salesperson at all times.  If the customer knows more about the car than the salesperson, there is definitely a problem.  ",1,53

2472,28-Oct-15,They had the vehicle listed as on sale online which I mentioned as we looked at the vehicle I showed them their Web site and price listed (which was 2k of MSRP). Then when we went inside they were like we'll the MSRP is 15K how does that work with your budget. Let's see not at all since I know you would sell the car for 2k less to start off. Then they lowball my trade in value.then like a show they had 3 other guys look at my trade raise the offer like they had faith and it wasn't a rehearsed game. Then the finance guy told me how insurance company's try to screw people and how that is terrible then tryed selling me extra insurance. If it wasn't for the price and it being manual I would not have purchased here. I never will buy a vehicle from them or and affiated dealer again. They try to play to many games and work in teams to confuse people. If I didn't know better they would have scammed me. ,1,53
2477,30-Jun-11,"Salesman had agreed to price via email.  Went in and over following week went for two test drives.  Then I went in to buy it for the same price (along with an extended warranty).  I gave them a figure that simply added an amount for the extended warranty.  The salesman stated that the GM had refused to honor the previously agreed price.  I was  told that &quot;we are $4000-5000 apart.&quot;  When I asked how simply adding the extended warranty could result in a $4000-5000 difference, I was then told that the car they offered me one week earlier must have had different options (in particular, he said maybe the first one didn't have the technology package).  This was bogus as the 2011 Genesis 4.6 sedan has all of the major options on it; it is not manufactured without them.  Moreover, the email quote was very specific.

In short, I left and the next day bought the same model from North Freeway Hyundai.  Same price as I was quoted in the email.  Great service from North Freeway.  Deal at North Freeway was agreed to in under 3-5 minutes.",1,53
2497,24-Oct-15,"Online purchase prices are incorrect and not honored. This is the most shady car dealership I've ever dealt with.

I typically take online reviews with a grain of salt since people have a tendency to write negative reviews more often than positive reviews...so we gave these guys a chance. BIG MISTAKE! I realize that the bait and switch is common practice in car sales, but we were repeatedly lied to my not only the sales rep, but even when the General Manager/CEO of HUB got involved. The GM even had the lack of class to call me at home and try to backtrack on the offer he had approved the night before. When I called him on it and said his business practices were unethical, he hung up on me.

Here's how it began: HUB Mitsubishi had a few of the models, trims and transmission we were looking for. We contacted sales rep Sal through their website, who e-mailed back and said he ""has several of these models"" on their lot ready to test drive and quoted us a price. When we showed up the next day, he magically didn't have any of them available, but only had more expensive versions with upgraded packages. After his Manager, Ed, got involved, he made excuses about how it takes several days or weeks to update their website and they had just ""sold"" the single model we wanted that morning. After some squabbling over inventory and advertised prices, we left. An hour later I received a call from Sal saying he had gone over his Manager's head and spoke to the General Manager who approved it for the price we were asking and just needed us to come in and sign the paperwork. Since it was already late in the day, we made plans to return the next morning. Before we could go out the door the GM called and said he was aware of our negotiations and would ""graciously"" lose money on the deal by selling us the car for $500 more than he had already agreed to sell it to us for. When I said that he needed to stand by his word and maintain ethical business practices, he hung up on me.

No one at HUB can be trusted. Their website inventory is incorrect, their sales reps and managers repeatedly lie, and their General Manager won't even stand by his word. Oh, and their showroom has live cockroaches running around...classy :)

I had specifically requested my drive out price and was e-mailed $25400. When I arrived in Houston, the salesmen was very nice, but as soon as I sat down with the finance manager to sign the paperwork, I noticed that they had tacked on an additional $1200 in fees making my drive out price $26728.18. They claimed that they add two packages to all of their vehicles which are non-negotiable: simonize (5 year paint and fabric protection) and UUG Anti-theft ($5000 toward purchase of new vehicle if car is stolen in the first 5 years). We negotiated those fees down but still ended up paying the same price as we were quoted in Austin. They will underbid and lie on the base price and make up their money in the end with additional fees. You would be better off calling them and negotiating a good deal over the phone and then use that as leverage with a more reputable dealership.

When I checked my car in the service rep told me it would cost $270. He also recommended I do a fuel system service which would entail taking the fuel injection system apart to “clean it out properly”. $181. Since it’s recommended every 15,000 miles I agreed.

Went to buy a car from an online ad on Auto-trader. Called ahead to make sure car was available and if they would honor online pricing. The rep on the phone told me to come in and they would take care of it. Got there and the car is unavailable, they wont honor the price because they don't know where that car is. So they ask what I am looking for and at what price. It happens to be the one in the showroom so they said we can have it. I confirm before they remove it for a test drive if the price they quoted is for this car. He assures me yes. Come back from my test drive and I'm ready to buy. He then tells me me that this is once I just drove is actually $2,500.00 more. If I wanted the original price they guaranteed me it would have to be another color and car.(our sales rep was a used car rep and they never allowed someone from the new cars to help us) It takes 5 hours for us to get to a price that both parties except. The manager never once introduces himself or comes to talk to us. Instead hides behind large tinted windows as the associates come to him and he sends 2-3 manager liaisons on his behalf. The manager liaison offers to give me tints and all weather mats if I agree and sign on the price after 5 hours of negotiations. After I sign they say they can only honor the tints or the mats because tints cost $300 and mats cost $500. (really ever heard of Amazon or Groupon) We agree on tints (with a manager liaison) and now it has been 7 hours and the finance department tells me that with a 780 credit score the best interest rate I get is 3.99%.Then tell me that they prefer not to use Hyundai Financing because they are horrible to deal with. So I ask for quote still to compare to the one from Wells Fargo. He goes into another office and 5 minutes comes back with a quote that is higher then 3.99%. I feel he manipulated the information to get that rate. Anyways now as we go to sign I look up and confirm the tints, and he (the financing guy) says according to his understanding they are not giving us tints or mats. At this point I am infuriated and my wife begins to cry out of frustration with these people. Then as we decide to walk away after 7+ hours at this place dealing with this and he(the financing guy) says "" I feel bad for you too so I'll go ahead and take care of it."" I signed on the price because they told me they were including tints and mats. Your not doing me a favor because your giving me half of what you promised. Also he states its ultimately his decision about selling the car to us. So why the heck did we spend our time talking to other people?  The only nice thing was the last technician that stayed till very late to show us the features of the car. Besides him, everyone else was unprofessional, disrespectful, rude, and a liar. Don't trust anything they say. Would not recommend buying a car at this dealership. In 2015 the customer has more knowledge and access to information that reduces the need for long traditional negotiations. Ultimately in the future they will get rid of dealers since there are no ""deals"" to be made. Everything is a rebate of some short or a price deduction based on a specific qualification. The internet price reflects that for disabled war veterans who are recent college graduates who previously also bought another car from Hyundai. Never think you are getting a deal on a car. The prices are inflated to accommodate this annoying song and dance at a dealership. It disturbs me deeply to know that I went through that to get a car. I was frustrated that I had spent my entire day there, and therefore refused to leave with out a car. Knowing I would have been treated much differently at any dealership, I regret doing my business with Hyundai at South Loop.

One sales manager Alonzo agreed that I had every right to expect them to honor the deal and that's nice, but they still wouldn't. If you look at their website, don't kid yourself into thinking the sales price means the sales price. Even though the web listing starts with the MSRP, then subtracts a dealer discount and any rebates, Sales manager Justin will explain that the listing doesn't include dealer preparation charges for tint, wheel locks, etc. so the sales price is actually a couple of thousand dollars higher than what they advertise.

Where I come from, ""sales price"" means the price you will sell the car for. From top to bottom, this was the worst run around - deceptive - typical dealer rip off experience I have ever had and I have bought a few cars in my life.

When we looked at the website again, we noticed the price dropped $1000.  Perfect!  When we arrived, we told Keith we were looking for the white Sonota that was listed on the Internet (there was only one listed).  He took us to the car.  We test drove it and loved it.  Then we noticed the mileage was a bit lower than listed in ad.  Keith then tells us we have the wrong car.  The one we just tested was $17,800!  We asked about the car we requested.  After investigating, Keith tells us the car was sold 3 days earlier.  (Then why the drop in price?). We asked to see a car like the one listed.

I arrived at dealership and test drove truck, wife and I spent two hours at dealership.  Rodney used car sales manger  even came out to see if I had questions about the truck.  I told Ron I will buy the truck for the ad price.  At that time it was told to me they could not sell me that truck because it was a mistake on ad.  Even though I had a copy of the ad they submitted on web site they would now commit to the sell.  I tried to talk to sales managers and left messages for the sale managers Rodney and Phil the general manger to call back.  They still have the truck listed as a platinum edition today which is false advertisement to the public.  BEWARE of this dealership  DO NOT TRUST THEM at all.

2687,13-Mar-13,"My experience buying a used car here included all of the terrible used car dealer stereotypes you hope you never have to encounter. All of the people we worked with, from the salesman to the finance people, were dishonest and manipulative. For example, we were told, ""I'm really doing all I can to get down to the price you need. I've been giving on my end, so I'll need you to give on your end too"", and really, all they were doing was extending the monthly terms of the loan while keeping the total purchase price the same. Our experience with the finance people was just as infuriating. I would strongly recommend looking over each and every line of every document (although, I don't recommend buying a car here at all!), because we found that extra costs would be added into our overall purchase price even after we told the man explicitly that we did not want those services. He repeatedly tried to argue that we should add these warranties because they don't increase our monthly payment amount; that was true, but again, our loan terms were extended, interest rate was the same, and our overall purchase price was higher.

Round two more of the same. Finally, they come back with a transparent offer that matched the sales price after we said we were leaving.

2766,08-Dec-03,"I recently purchased a 2004 G35 Sedan from this dealer.  If there had been an alternate dealer in Austin or San Antonio that had the vehicle I wanted, I would have left and gone there based on my experience.  For that matter, I nearly left to go to Sewell Infiniti in Dallas since when I spoke with them on the phone they were much more helpful and courteous.Since my employer is a vendor used by Nissan, I am eligible for Nissan's Vehicle Purchase Program.  Based on this, I took a serious look at both the Nissan and Infiniti vehicle lines given that my discount would save a few thousand off MSRP and since I was supposed to be given a pre-determined price without any negotiation.  The first time I stopped by to see if the dealer participated in the VPP program and get a quote for the pre-determined VPP price, the sales person said that they didn't participate.  After speaking with the manager on duty though, he agreed that they might be able to quote me the price, and that he'd have the New Car Sales Manager call me the next day to discuss.After hearing back that they would give me the VPP price for the month, I scheduled a time to come in with my wife for a test drive a few days later.  On the day of the test drive, we arrived at the agreed upon time but ended up waiting around a lot and in the end only got to spend 15 minutes with the sales person driving the car and 15 minutes with us driving before they closed.  Since we were still interested in the car, we set up a time to come back the following day to drive further.  Before leaving, when I brought up the topic of price, the sales person started to hedge again whether or not they would honor the VPP price.  By the time we left, we were pretty frustrated given how much time we had wasted, and that they still hadn't told us the price.  This was especially annoying given that I was able to call Sewell Infiniti in Dallas and get a quote on the VPP price in less than 20 minutes over the phone.When we went back the following day, we were given about 45 minutes to drive the car alone because they were having a sales meeting.  This was great, but when we got back to the dealership the shenanigans started again.  First, when I brought up the topic of price the sales person tried to stick a credit application in my face which I complained about vigorously.  Second, the sales person didn't seem to have the answers to any of my questions and kept running off to talk to other people making the discussion very drawn out.  Finally, I blew up and said that if they had any desire to sell me the vehicle today they needed to quote me a price NOW or I was leaving.  After that, things settled down and the experience became tolerable.The bottom line is that if you walk in the door to this dealership without clear expectations and knowing exactly what you want, I could totally see this dealer walking all over you.  It is unfortunate that there is not a second Infiniti dealership in Austin to keep them honest.",1,63

No where on their little sheet did it show a $1,000 special discount. It was a lot of talk trying to get ME to understand why they do it that way. I crossed out $10,225 and wrote in $9,225 and said we'll start from there. Manager goes back and comes back with $9,000 and that's the ""lowest"" they could go.

He tells me GM was upset that salesman ""let me leave"" so they were offering me this low price just to keep my business. This is the reason I don't like buying used cars from a dealership. I told salesman I wanted their price upfront and I didn't want all the back and forth games. I guess he didn't hear that.

Before he sent in the finance man I asked our salesman to look up the price on his smart phone and he said he could not find it listed which was a lie.  I could not beleive that they would not give us any prices on any vehicles only that they would work with us.  I feel we were brought in on false pretense and he never had the vehicle he said he did.  Did he think we would not look up the price to see if we were being treated fairly?

However, the price sheet brought back to me was roughly $3500 more than the price advertised online (which is why I came to your dealership...the advertised price).  Jaron explained the warranty that was added to the car, he also mentioned it was a way for the dealership to recoup some of the labor cost for prepping the vehicle.  After I told him I was not going to pay more than the advertised price, he got his manager.  His manager confirmed that he would not sell the car for less than the elevated warranty price.

After the director's departure, I continued discussions with Jaron, I expressed my displeasure of the bait and switch tactic.  Jaron began to tell me I was a bad consumer because if I didn't pay the elevated price I was preventing him from supporting his daughter.  This was the absolute worst sales tactic I have ever seen.

At this point I walked out of the Used Car building and went straight to NEw Car building asking for the GM.  I met a gentleman named, I believe his name was Carl, whom I explained my entire experience with.  HE left me for a minute, I assume to speak with Jaron and his team.

I was clear that was all I wanted to pay and if they couldn't do that as msrp is 25k then we could save each other some time. The salesman talked to finance and they said I should go for a test drive.  When we came back the salesman had me sign a form saying that if I got my price, then I would buy that night.  I had no problem with it.  They then gave me a menu of prices.  They tried to decrease my payments over a longer period of time which would have still got them msrp or more.  I said no.

The salesman went back and forth with finance and then had me sign another form with 25k listed again.  I said why do you keep writing that number down. He said don't worry it will change later they just have to put that number down so he can get it past the owner and that isn't the price and it will change. At this point, I felt like I needed a shower as this felt like a very dirty deal.

They then trotted out more new numbers.  At this point I wasn't sure when the number would change to the 21-22k. Long story short it never did.  I think I got about 700 dollars off msrp after they claimed they are only making 350 dollars on the deal and that they had to make sure the owner didn't see the paperwork.  I don't think the owner would be that upset considering they then advertised a sales event five days later.

Finally he says $16,183.33 which I agreed to and made sure it would include a 2nd key which magically appeared while on the phone. He said ""i have it right here in my hand."" So, reluctantly, I agree to drive down the next morning and meet at 9 am and if everything checks out would make the deal. I should have known better! Get there and drive the car which was advertised as having lane assist and the brake assist and back up alarms all features that I wanted for my daughter. Thought it was me and that I had not activated features so, when I returned to dealer and asked how to activate. He gets in and fumbles around not saying anything except let me printout the window sticker and he took off to his office, brought it back and started off on how rare this gem of a car was to have traction control?!? I asked again about the 
lane assist and other safety features. He says oh, this car does not have those features, they are only available on 2020 models! I said your internet ad states that it does, so he tells me, ""Well I dont write those ads."" 
Then totally exasperated I walk out as he is saying ""We have 2020's."" Wow, what a piece of work, I am stunned that dealerships like this exist and this was my first and last experience with Grapevine Ford. I have always bought from Huffines in Corinth Classic in Sherman and always treated with respect and make transparent deals. Oh, and he also said they have the lowest priced dealer ad ons in the metroplex, bragging rights??? Part of the double talk I have  left out for times sake that were just as bogus as the rest. Anyway, buyer beware as they always say! Not going to mention the assistant sales managers name, but you know who you are, I was not your sucker customer of the day.  Buyer's please know what you are getting into on these deals, always ask for a full disclosure of fees and there close to 100% profit add ons are a hoax.
 The absolute worst part of this is they have these huge floor displays of the 10 rules of ethics, yeah right! By the way, those $500 keys are usually around $200 retail at honest dealerships and can be had all day online for $100.
Truth in advertising complaint needs to be filed.",1,74
3335,29-Oct-18,"1 star only because it doesn't allow negative stars!  Rather than insult any other professions, what a bunch of car salesman!  I have it in writing from the Internet Sales Manager (which I think everyone gets that title so they sound important) the lies they tell to try to get you in the dealership.  This came about after I had an internet price and they tried to quote it $3,000 higher, I called them on it and they began making excuses.  Continue to get emails after I requested NO MORE and so I called them out again on their deceptive practices.  If Grapevine Ford can't be honest up front with their customers in the advertising, then what makes you think you can trust them in regards to anything they say or how they handle service on your car.  AVOID there are GOOD dealerships out there, Grapevine Ford is just not it!",1,74
3344,19-Feb-18,I have bought two vehicles from Grapevine Ford and everything was great but now they are engaging in faulty and deceptive advertising. Grapevine Ford post the MSRP on their website but the actual resale could be 20% higher. It is acceptable to add a premium due to demand and availability but they need to make that clear on advertising and sticker price. All other dealerships advertise true price. Very disappointed as they were very straight forward in the past.,1,74
3345,29-Jan-18,"Seriously worst dealership I ever had to deal with! I know going to a dealership is usually not a fun experience and they all want to get as much money out of you as possible but this place is by far the worst. First off they put amazing prices on their website for vehicles and once you call or actually go to the dealership to check it out the car is either "" just sold this past week"" or they will make up a fee and add a ridiculous amount of money to it. Oh and if your wanting to trade your car in, don't expect to get anything Kelly Blue Book, NADA, or any other online website thinks the trade in value is. Apparently they just make their own price up for that too. So, I went in there to take a look at a new 2018 mustang and trade my 2014 mustang in which has 55,000 miles, only been washed by hand, only used royal purple oil for oil changes, and I put close to $1,000 into it putting custom leather seat covers in it, adding weather tech floor mats, and tinted the windows with a lifetime guarantee. They wanted to give me $8,500 for trading it in. I told the sales rep I looked it up on Kelly Blue Book and it says the trade in value is $11,059 not including the money I put in it. He said KBB is a western company and that they use NADA. So, I looked up the NADA trade in value. The NADA clean trade in value is $11,575. Then, I was talking to a sales manager trying to negotiate a price and I told him about the NADA trade in value, and no joke he tells me they don’t use NADA to look at trade in values, they use this other website. I can’t remember what that site was called. To make this story short, we couldn't come to agreement on the trade in or the final price of the car. Two days later, I look online and find a New 2018 Ford Raptor at the same dealership for $51,080. Amazing price right! So when I called them and tried to see if they still have it in stock and see what the price was, the person I talked to said there was not any sale reps in the dealership at the moment and they would call me back as soon as one comes in. This was at 8:15 am they open at 7:00 am. That seemed kind of fishy to me.  So I had a friend of mine call them 5 minutes later, and guess who answers, a sales rep. He told my friend the vehicle is in stock, but you need to add a $10,000 fee to the MSRP sticker price, so the final price is $61,000. 45 minutes later a female sales rep gave me a call. This sales rep said the vehicle is in stock but you have to add $15,000 to the MSRP sticker price. I said why do you have to add $15,000? And no lie, she stuttered and actually took a while to come up with an excuse as to why they add that much to it. She then asked me if I wanted to come see it and I said I only wanted to come see it if I can get it for the price you advertised on your website. She then said, “Ya we can’t sell it to you for that price"". I then texted the sticker for the vehicle to the sales rep I talked to about the mustang. He texted me back saying, ""yes that vehicle is in stock"". I then texted him if he wanted to sell a truck today and sell me for the price on their website and on the sticker then I will come up there and purchase it that day. You probably guessed it he never texted me back. So if you want some advice, I would not go to this dealership. All they do is play games, make up numbers, and try to screw people over. If you see a good price online for this dealership just add a minimum of $10,000 to it and that’s the real price. Also, I would never trade my car into this place. Expect to get a couple thousand dollars less than what the trade in value should be.",1,74
3361,01-Dec-16,"The salesman picked out a car from inventory and said he could trade for it.  We negotiated on the car and agreed on a price.  The sales manager came in and took a little more off the top and closed the deal.  He assured me they secured the trade and to come pick it up in 2 days.

When I got there to take delivery I discovered on my own they didn't get the right car.  I asked and they said it was, I referred back to our paper work and showed them it was not.  The sales manager Jeremy found out he could not trade for the car I wanted and he switched vehicles on our final offer paper and my final contract and paper work.  At no point during this process did they tell us they swapped cars.

After all this they wanted me to promise I would give them perfect marks on my survey they sent me.  All they care about is their survey.  Other dealerships want honest feedback on how they are doing, not perfect marks to hide their flaws.

Lies and lies after and I cancelled the deal.  ",1,74
3412,27-Jul-12,"First off, I was very pleased with my sales associate, Robert Miller. He helped my pregnant wife and I find the right vehicle for our growing family. He was very knowledgeable and easy to work with. I am pleased with the vehicle that we decided upon, the 2013 Ford Explorer. My issue is with the games they play to try to make money at Grapevine Ford Lincoln. I was initially quoted a price of roughly $39600 on my vehicle even after telling them several times that my budget was to stay below $35000. After haggling for 2+ hours to get the price to something I could live with, I was told that it would be just a few minutes until I would be ushered back to the finance guy, Brian Mainard. We sat there waiting for over an hour before anyone came by and inquired as to what we were doing. Once we got back to Brian's office, he pitched us 15 kinds of insurance for the vehicle, all sending the total cost well past my budget price. After I told Brian I wanted NONE of the extras he was trying to sell me, he put his sleazy car salesman hat on and ""worked the numbers."" He said he would keep my payments the same and offer me the extra services. I thought ""great,"" I'm getting these services for free. Essentially he lowered my interest rate, but charged my for the price of the extra insurance, keeping my payments close to the same, but again sending the total price well past the price we had shaken hands on several hours earlier. My question is, if he has the power to reduce interest rate with the wave of his hand, which was half of what he first quoted me, then why wasn't I offered the lower interest rate in the first place? I'll tell you why, because they only care about the bottom line and nothing about helping the customer into the right vehicle for the right price. Here is the kicker! Once I got home I searched cars.com, for similar Explorers, which I had done several time while researching what vehicle I wanted. Lo and behold our Explorer was on there. I must have missed it when searching before. The kicker is that the list price on the vehicle on the internet was only $400 more than what we finally agreed upon, $4000 less than the $39600 I was originally quoted. That would have been a great starting point! I hope you have learned something from this review, I know I have. Bottom line, I will never again deal with Grapevine Ford Lincoln and Brian Mainard!",1,74
3413,11-Jun-12,"Called Trent to verify price and ask about certain features on car after seeing advertised on website. He checked car came back and verified it had window tinting and alarm along with all features listed. After I informed him I was on the way there, my husband and I drove there. Upon entering another man named Mark said he would help me and we went on a test drive. We came back in and he showed us the price $299 more then the website price Trent had verified. We were told they had to add on for window tinting and the website price had accidentally been marked a $1000 too low but they would give it to me with an extra $299. I said I wanted the price I called and verified and they just told me same thing over and over. Several people called on days to follow and they all said the same thing. It was very annoying. I felt very very bad about the whole experience.",1,74

So I email several local dealerships and request a quote.  The one with the best price and honest answers wins my business......that was not Grapevine Ford.",1,74
3420,01-Jun-10,"Was at that the dealership for an hour and a half before I even got the price on the vehicle I was looking at (rule of thumb, if you're in the business of selling you might want to know the prices). The price once i did get it was extremely high. After haggling for another 2 hours i got them down to what they called their ""absolute lowest"" price they could do and we parted ways from there. I had a friend call the next morning inquiring about the same vehicle and they gave her the price I had just spent 3 hours to get right off, over the phone. The manager informed me before I left that these deals dont come along very often. Turns out they do, I bought one a day later. It was newer, nicer, fewer miles, certified and less money. Thanks Grapevine Ford for not selling me a car... Your the best!",1,74

If they couldn't afford it, why did they call me there? Do not trust anything they say on the phone. They just want people to come to the dealership thinking they'll then buy the car at their price. DO NOT BUY A CAR FROM THEM. I rather recommend Town North. They were very friendly and stuck to their words.",1,75

I agreed to the price with the sales person. Price was confirmed. Then they ran may credit. Credit over 700. When it was time to sign papers, the agreed price was increase because they added an extended warranty to my total without advising me in the beginning and saying it was not optional. If they do not reverse the inquiry, I will take this up with my general council. This is just one part of the issue with this dealership. Rude sale reps. Bait and switch tactics, need I say more!!!!

3520,24-Mar-20,"The dealer listed the price of a vehicle (before TTL) at multiple online sites (cars.com, CarGurus.com, their site, etc) as $14,691. Once I went and test drove, the salesman told me that the price of the vehicle was actually starting around $18,000 due to things that they did on the front end as dealer add-ons (window tint, EPP, GPS, tire locks, etc) and there was no wiggle room. He told me that they did this pricing advertisement technique specifically to attract people to the dealership. If I would've known that the actual price of the car was $18K, I would've never test drove it or even gone in the first place. It was a massive disappointment and a waste of my time, as I was ready to buy my first car and actually in love with the car. It was sleezy and made me understand why people hate used car dealers. If you're looking to be deceived and ripped off, this is the perfect place to come! Don't worry, I've already filed a complaint to the DMV about this massive misrepresentation.",1,79
3531,13-Nov-19,"WORST experience EVER! (See Photos).I have not ever been so rudely disrespected. I'm still in shock!

Online I came across 2 Nissan Sentra S. A NEW 2019 for $15.5k & a USED 2019 grey/silver for $14k. My reservation was for Saturday 11/9/19 at 6pm. I went in around 1:30p. When I arrived; I was greeted by Rashad & his trainee.

I gave Rashad both ads from THEIR website. As we're going over features; the S model didn't have keyless entry, but SV model did. I was sold immediately (I had 0 desire for the drawn out 'test drive'). This is not my first time buying/trading a vehicle. I have my own APPROVED financing; all I needed was car info & final price. 

He comes back w/ the price marked up to $20.5k (CONVENIENTLY w/o $2.6k dealer discount), & only Nissan $2k rebate =18.5k but ADDS Wheel locks & Nitro-$599, EPP-$1,899, & Tint-$499=2,997. $22k BEFORE TTL! I'm NOT paying $3k for wheel locks on a Nissan, AIR in tires, a GLORIFIED wax/wash & a OVERPRICED window tint.

I kindly advised him that I didn't need nor want any of those things & showed him FOUR 2019 Nissan SV CURRENTLY listed on THEIR website for $15,681. Here is where things go downhill fast. Rashad leaves & a sales manager returns to reiterate the add ons come w/ it. If it 'comes' w/ it; it would be INCLUDED in the LISTING price. I leave telling him that if the car is not $15,681 w/ said 'add ons'; no deal.

I return a few hours later, they persisted w/ the add-ons & I left again. FACTORY made cars DON'T ""come"" w/ DEALER add-ons! They're ""dealer add-ons"" because the MANUFACTURER DOESN'T offer them as purchase options;otherwise you'd have to upgrade or wait for a CUSTOM made car..FROM the MANUFACTURER!!

Monday, I was still interested in the model & decided to reach out to the GM via reply email/# provided in a 'welcome' email. NO RESPONSE the ENTIRE day. Today, OC contacts me & during the conversation, I QUOTE VERBATIM, ""We do not have to list them."" YES YOU DO! If they are NOT listed as MANUFACTURE INCLUDED FEATURES they are OPTIONAL! It is in FACT ILLEGAL to NOT list them & force the charges to the customer! I then spoke to customer specialist Ashley. 3rd time is a charm, right?

I was UTTERLY & COMPLETELY WRONG. I get there & met Leo. He pulls my file & says the GM would come speak w/me. I was NOT met w/the GM (Chad Milow); instead it was a sales director, Roger. He shows me where they have marked the add-ons down to $400 (coincidence?). I tell him they have 16 Sentra SV on their lot. ONE of them is pure factory. He tells me no; which I know is a LIE. 16 customers added the EXACT same add-ons that were outsourced & DIDN'T purchase? Add-ons CANNOT be put on a FACTORY car until the car is SOLD! 

I call Nissan corporate to verify. He gets PISSED, SNATCHES the paper, walks off, & tells me to & I QUOTE VERBATIM ""Go purchase at the other dealership then! Why are you here?"" Excuse me?

I could not believe my eyes nor my ears! I politely walked to the front desk to ask his information. Leo returns & I explain to him what just happened, how rude & disrespectful that was. Leo tells me I can't call competition to ask about the same car & that the director doesn't want to 'deal w/ that'. Excuse me? The ONLY reason he doesn't want to deal w/ it because he KNEW he was LYING. As a BUSINESS you get customers by market competing! That is literally the model of business no matter what industry you are in!

I presume while I was headed home; they talked. Leo reached out & said they would do the deal if I accepted the numbers offered by the director. I told him I didn't get a clear look at everything, because the director snatched the paper so fast. NO RESPONSE. The ONLY way I would still purchase from here is IF I got the Sentra SV at listing price & a match on my trade-in. Other than that; I would NEVER DO BUSINESS HERE & I advise ANYONE else to NOT do it either. That is no way to treat NEW or any customer for that matter.",1,79

To that base they added ""dealership upgrades"" totaling $4,396.00, and disclosed only $1,000.00  of that total to me.

They do not specify this on any of the websites they advertise on including their own website.  After further negotiations we finally agreed upon a price.

As soon as I arrive at the dealership the salesman and I start walking to the truck and he says ""you know this truck has 5000 miles on it correct""?  He took me to a truck I had never seen before that was a demo.  He obviously knew this was a different truck than we had been discussing.

Good afternoon Mr. xxxxxx,
 
This is Jerrell Price from Central Houston Nissan, we spoke earlier today on the phone.  I apologize for the delay but I was making sure we found the right vehicle with the features you are looking for.  I need to ask you a few questions about the Altima you're looking for.  Did you want the Technology package on the vehicle?  If so, I have one in pearl white.  The invoice price which is the price the dealership owns the car for is $34,034. The MSRP is $35,895 plus tax title and license. I can sell you the vehicle at the invoice price of $34,700 minus the rebates which is $3,000 bringing the vehicle price down to $31,700 plus your tax, title, and license.  In this situation I want to earn your business and take care of our law enforcement.  Down worry about the price of the tax, title, and license.  For you it will just be $31,700 drive out.  If you want the Altima SL without the Technology package, then your drive out will be $30,656.  It was a pleasure speaking with you earlier.  Give me a call and let me know what I can do to earn your business.

They will try their best to trick you into paying more money for the price of the car than you agree to.

We were interested in one car, and the manager agreed to a total price of $23,800 drive out (which included tax, license, documentary charge and fees). But when they did the paperwork, the finance person added an extra $ 1,429.28 which was never acknowledged by us and meanwhile he offered several additional warranties to let us buy, to draw our attention away from this extra charge.


The following is what we are agreed to for pricing
Drive out (including tax, license, documentary charge and fees)	$23,977.19 
trade in car	($7,800)
Extend service	$926 
Maintenance package	$480 
Rebate (this rebate is 
promotion for use finance service) 	($1,500)
 Total finance	$16,083.19 


The following is what the dealership charged us 
sale price(should have included tax, license, documentary charge and fees but did not)	$23,977.19 
Theft protection	$100 
trade in car	($7,800)
sale tax	$923.57 
Vehicle inventory tax	$47.71 
license fee 	$153 
Inspection fee 	$7

promotion for use finance service) 	($1,500)
Total finance	$17,512.47 

Since we had our two year old son with us, my husband and I had to alternate talking to the finance person which he took advantage of.  He never showed us a detailed breakdown of the charges. He just told me that my husband could sign the paperwork when he brought my son back from the  restroom. Because we had a trade in car, had some financing, and bought some additional warranties, and had up to a $1500 rebate, my husband was unable to calculate an exact number so he truly believed the finance person. Although, he didn't show us any paper work or explain in any detail for the charges and just rushed my husband to sign the paperwork.  

After my husband signed the paper work and drove the new car home, we found one indicator light was on, then I asked  to have it checked out. I obviously couldn't buy a brand new car that already had problems. But the salesman just told us to drive a little longer and the light would go away, but it never went off. 

We went home to have dinner and this was when we realized that the invoice amount they charged was not what they told us. My husband immediately went  back to dealership to ask for a refund of the additional charge and they told him their boss was not there now but they would  give us back at least $500 on Monday, which was the next  business day. 

But on Monday, when my husband contacted them they rejected to refund the overcharge amount and said your wife agreed to pay this amount. This is such a big lie. They never showed any paper work to me. I only asked the finance person why they offered 0 percent financial rates and still charge 3.99% of interest rate to us?  Then the finance person said either you can chose $1500 rebate with 3.99% rate or no rebate with 0 % interest rate. The finance person also suggested we choose the $1,500 rebate with 3.99% than taking no rebate with 0 % interest rate. So I chose $1,500 rebate with 3.99% interest rate, therefore we should have SUBTRACTED $1500 from our drive out amount ( $23,800) but they ADDED $ 1,429.28 first AND then deducted $1,500 AND also charge 3.99% of interest rate. We ended up with a rebate of only $70.72. This is trick they are playing.

1. The dealership used the new brake down amount instead of the agreed drive out price to confuse what is the exact price. (They never showed us the breakdown of the pricing before we signed the paper work)

2. The dealership is  mixing up the car price with finance promotion. (to avoid giving us the real $1500 rebate)

Now with the over charge and also the new car itself having problems, we asked for a full refund all money. They rejected again even with the warranty printed on the back of Power Nissan’s service invoice. According to Nissan’s own warranty, Nissan should replace or refund my car. 

I just want to tell all the people that want to buy a Nissan, save yourself the hassle and lies, and never go to Central Houston Nissan dealership.

Took a look at the car - it was in excellent condition, so we proceeded inside to talk business.  We were brought a price of $12600, which we rejected, showing the salesman the AutoTrader website price.  After speaking to the manager, he came back with $11,600  we told him we wanted the price we showed him.  Back to the manager, to return with the advertised price plus a $2995 reconditioning fee. At that point we left. While driving away,I called the internet salesperson with whom we had verified the availability.  She promised to check with the manager to see what had happened and return our call.  Still waiting on that call. ",1,79
3674,06-Jan-11,"My dealings with Baker Nissan South was very poor.  I would not recommend them to anyone.  It started with Chris Bennet e-mailing me a price for a new 2011 Nissan Rogue (with quick response).  He told me over the phone he had me approved for a new Roque within my monthly payment range ($450) with putting $2,000 down.  I also received an additional e-mail from Jose Molina offering an additional $500 off, a free window tint, and 1 year free maintenance (unlimited mileage).  When I showed up for my appointment the next day Chris was not there, so I was given to Shelby (who was very helpful)  After taking a test drive and picking out a vehicle, I gave copies of the e-mails I had received with the pricing/discounts to Shelby.  Shelby came back from financing with a price that was $3800 higher than what was e-mailed and higher than the monthly price I was told was available.  I had just wasted over 2 hours of mine, my wife's, and Shelby's time.  After a little haggling we agreed on a price, because I was in a bind.  Our company had taken away our company vehicles and said we needed to get our own by the end of the year. I was going out of town the next day, so I had to make a deal.  Then to top it off, I had to drive back 45 minutes, later in the day because they had put the wrong vin on the paperwork.  I love the vehicle so far, but am very leary of the dealer standing behind what they say they will do.  Don't believe what you are told up front.",1,79

Get there and interior of car is horrible, but I was willing to take it to an upholstery dealer and repair.  They inform us that they will have new inventory the weekend (so you would think they want to sell this one) so we can actually get one of those.  We politely inform them we are not going over amount agreed upon.  Get ready to close the deal and the price keeps going up! We left and won't be going back.

I've had major problems with service getting the things repaired on truck and complaining they are putting too much money into truck. When actually after I finally got my loan paperwork I noticed the items added to loan. Finance said they had a better interest rate and we needed to resign and then increased everything in price but finance told me everything was the same and to just sign here, here, and here. When actually the price was higher and extended warranties were added but interest rate was much lower so they made more money. I will never go back to buy another vehicle from this dealership and will make sure all our acquaintances will not either. They were upset with me when I was the customer being pushed to the side waiting in 100+ heat with my family and they couldn't get my truck out of service that took them 2 days and I had no way to go being 100 miles from home.

3722,08-Jun-11,"We went to this dealer and had all our homework done.  When it came to crunching numbers the dealership thought that we were stupid.  They wanted to run our credit well before the number crunching was started, this is a bad thing for most people who do not need their credit dinged if the dealing process falls apart.  They had some very creative numbers to supposedly get a better price, but when you did the math (which they hope you don't do)it is not right.  The first area that upset us was the negotiation of the vehicle price. we were told that there was no incentives on the vehicle. We ""thought"" we had signed off on a $36750 price tag for a Nissan Maxima.  When the paperwork came to us the price was listed as $38750.  They informed us that they were giving us a $2000 rebate as an incentive.  This rebate is done AFTER taxes so we were having to pay an extra $125.  The price we negotiated for the car was a sham.  Then came the trade in value.  They kept telling us they were giving us $10094 for our trade in, but in reality it was only $9500.  They invented some cockimeme story about how they were giving us a tax credit of 593.75 that made the value of our trade this $10094 when in reality this is NOT a value, it is already a GIVEN.  The amount of the trade in already has the ""tax credit"" built in.  It was a lousy tactic to make it appear we were getting a great deal.  When we called them on it, we were told to have a great shopping around experience. (we did, we left there and went to another dealership that played no games and got a great deal!!)

Funny thing though is first thing Monday morning we were called telling us they were willing to meet our pricing demands, too bad they were too late.  

I do want to say that our salesman, Jason Cortez, was really good, very well informed about the car we were looking at.  He was extremely nice to work with.  It is just a shame he is working for this awful dealership.

The car had less than 2000 miles on it and, per the salesman, had not been wrecked.  What kind of reconditioning does a practically new car need? I have filed a complaint with the BBB and Nissan but want ANYONE who is considering a purchase from this dealer to beware...they will lie to you and will wait until they think you're sucked in to tell you the real story.

3763,10-Apr-10,"DO NOT GO HERE!!! FALSE ADVERTISEMENT!!! FALSE PRICES!!! AND THEY WILL DECIDE WHAT VEHICLE THEY WANT YOU TO BUY!! THEY DON'T TAKE NO FOR AN ANSWER!! We found a 2007 Nissan Murano we liked on their website. It had the right miles (35,578) and the right price ($16,986). My husband call and talked to the receptionist on Monday, April 5, 2010 to get more information and to set up a time to test drive it later on the week. We didn't get any information from her and she said she would have a salesman contact us to set an appointment. Well, the salesman didn't call till Wednesday, April 7 just to write down all the information we gave to the receptionist and he said he would call back that afternoon to set up a time for us to test drive the car. Well, that never happened. I checked their website several times throughout each day to make sure the car was there before we drove the 3 hours there. My husband even called before we left to make sure they had the car. They said they did, so we headed up there Friday April 9. Once we got there, we saw that they didn't have all these pre-owned Nissan Muranos that they advertise on their website (their website shows 43). A salesman immediately took us inside to get our information and start a deal before we even saw any vehicle. We told him we wanted to look first before anything because we were going to be paying in cash plus the trade in value of our 2002 Nissan Altima. We never told him how much cash we were willing to pay. Then he walks out and goes and talks a manager. A hour later, the salesman runs outside to bring a car to the front for us to look at. He takes my husband immediately to the back seat first instead of letting him looking at the mileage. So I looked. It was a 2004 Nissan Murano with 90,000 miles on it. We immediately said NO THATS NOT WHAT WE WANT, IT HAS WAY TOO MANY MILES. But his manager decided that it was what he thought we should buy and that's why he brought it around. We never talked to this manager at all. So the salesman went back inside to let the manager know that we didn't want that Murano. While he was doing that, we went and looked at their other pre-owned Muranos. They only had 2 (their website showed 43). Both were 2009 with less than 30,000 miles. The salesman came back out and tried to talk us into buying one of them. We said only if they increase the price of our trade in and drop the price of the Murano down. Well, he didn't like that. So we went on a ""tour"" of the dealership looking for other Muranos. When we didn't find any other Muranos, the salesman tried to get us to buy a different vehicle. We said NO, WE WANT A NISSAN MURANO. He takes us back inside to see if they had any other Muranos plus try to talk us into buying a different vehicle. We kept said NO but he didn't like that response to his offers. So he went and got that manger. The manager treated us like we were dumb. We found out at that point the 2007 Nissan Murano we saw on their website had been sold early that week. We asked why did they not remove it from their website. They said they didn't have the resources or time to update their website. They didn't know this but my husband used to be a salesman for a car dealership back home. So when my husband started talking with the manager, my husband pointed out everything including their false advertisement. The manager said it wasn't false advertisement. But it was. They didn't have the 43 pre-owned Nissan Muranos and the price online is about $5,000 lower than what it actually is. They can say it because of certification but it doesn't cost that much. At that point the manager started getting really rude with us. He started offering us other vehicles. We said NO. Then he offers us a truck. Again we said NO because we're trying to start a family and thinking about our future needs in a vehicle. After that NO he started insulting us and called us names. At that point, knowing we were going to agree on anything, we got up said we'll take our money else where the people aren't rude and walked out with the salesman and manager following us all the way to our car with the manager harassing and insulting us the whole way. My husband tried as much as possible to keep his cool. I went straight to our car and started it up while he had some last words with the manager. About 45 minutes later, one of the managers from dealership called us to make an appointment for the following day, Saturday, April 10. My husband told him he had already been there today, will not ever return, he was pissed off with a manger insulting us and that they were the worse dealership he's ever dealt with and hung up.

3789,24-Jun-17,"Here is what happened to me during my purchase of a 2017 Hyundai Sonata at World Car Hyundai in San Antonio, TX. After reading this you should understand why I scored the survey as I did.  On Saturday June 10th my wife and I visited the dealership looking for a 2017 Hyundai Sonata Limited. The sales person greeted us and showed us what was available on the lot. I had gone through Truecar and this is what led me to this dealership. There weren’t a lot of choices available on the Limited model in San Antonio. We found the 2017 Hyundai Sonata Limited 2.0 Turbo and test drove it. We liked the vehicle very much and decided to go forward with the purchase. During the negotiations the dealership presented a price and ultimately we decided on a price $500 less. Everything was set. I was going to pay cash but was told I could save more money if I financed with Hyundai so I did. From the time we agree on a price to the time I actually got the vehicle took approximately 4 hours. Seemed like forever. The financing when through just fine. We scheduled an appointment to have the appearance package added to the vehicle the next week. We drove the vehicle home and thought everything was good.   Three days later I get a call from the finance guy saying I added the wrong vehicle to my insurance. The VIN on the vehicle from the ID card they have does not match what they sold me. I verified that the VIN on the ID card is indeed the vehicle they sold me. Then the finance guy realized they screwed up and did the whole deal on the wrong vehicle. He said I would need to sign all new paperwork. I agree to meet him at a Starbucks halfway between my house and the dealership and sign the correct paperwork. I met him and while I was going through the new paperwork when I can to the document with the total purchase price I noticed the price had increased by $2600. He did NOT tell me this, I’m the one that pointed it out. I said we have a problem. This is not the price we negotiated. He said he understood but the price we negotiated was on a different vehicle. I said that was not my fault. I test drove the vehicle I wanted. And in good faith negotiated the price on that vehicle. He said I would have to drive back to the dealership and speak to the sales manager.   I drove all the way back to the dealership. Spoke with the sales manager and he said the only thing they can do is reduce the price by $500. I said that was unacceptable. They should give me the price we negotiated. It was not my fault that they used pricing on a different vehicle. He accused me of wanting free money. I requested to speak with the General Manager. Gave him my story and he agree to give me $1200 off but not the full $2600 price increase. This whole time neither the Sales Manager or General Manager EVER ONCE apologized to me for what was happening. The salesman we had (Andy Bailey) did apologize but he was the only one. I was in a dilemma. On one hand I wanted to scrape the whole deal and get my trade-in back. But we had the new vehicle for 3 days and I had no idea what had happened to my trade-in. Plus we had been looking for a new vehicle for awhile and had gone to a few dealerships and was so ready for the process to be over.   All said and done, they agree to reduce the total to $1500, but not the full $2600. I agree because I just wanted it to be over. I still feel this was wrong. I believe that World Car should have stood on THEIR mistake and compensated me financially as well as ALL the time it took doing this. They were completely unprofessional (again not Andy Bailey the salesman).   So the next week I take the vehicle in for the appearance package (on a Friday). Was told I would get it back the same day. I got it late the next day and there were scratches on the driver and passenger side window tents which the service guy pointed out to me. So  we set up ANOTHER appointment. I went back the next week and got the windows redone.   All told, I have been to World Car Hyundai 5 times in two weeks. I live 20 miles away.   This is why I scored the survey as I did.

So they pulled the classic ""bait and switch"" which, by the way, is an actionable Deceptive Trade Practice in Texas.  But whatever, no hurt feelings.  I can brush off slimy sales practices and just head somewhere else without a care in the world.

What I CANNOT abide (and the real reason for my post) is how incredibly rude Drey was toward us.  He was aggressive, patronizing, and dismissive of any questions we asked.  He spent about 5 minutes talking to us, which was mostly him lecturing us about why we were naive to think the car would actually cost anything CLOSE to the advertised price.  He lectured us about waxing, ""scotch guard"" crap, refurbishing costs, etc.  

I repeatedly asked for a statement showing the drive-away price and the charges that would go into the price but he wouldn't accommodate us.

When we said we couldn't pay what he was demanding, he stormed off without even saying goodbye.  As soon as we finished saying the price was too high, he stood up and walked off, saying ""take care"" when his back was already to us.

Nissan of Rockwall: how do you employ someone like this???  I've never encountered someone so rude at a retail store before.  Shady and dishonest?  Sure.  But at the very least I expect common courtesy and civility while I'm being screwed.

3849,03-Oct-18,"I traveled over 3 hours to buy a truck that was advertised in listingallcars for a good price. I called before I traveled to be certain that my trade would bring a fair price and that there were no hidden fees.  I was assured that if my trade was how I described it there would be no problem. The salesman was actually a good guy but the process was so awful that I found myself having to demand that the key to my trade in be returned so that I could leave. I was first informed that there would be $2000 added to the advertised price due to previously undisclosed dealer ""add-ons"". Next I was told that because I wanted to pay cash that $4000 would have to be subtracted from the Nissan discount, next I was told that even though my trade-in was exactly as I had described they nonetheless could give me only $6000 for it - I was told $7000 over the phone. At each point in this somewhat grueling negotiation I was left, like the sucker I was being taken for, to wait while ""Management discussed the deal"". Next I was told that I would have to finance the truck in order to have the advertised price plus the add-on honored. I did not want to finance and I told them so but they insisted that I provide them with a credit application - I refused. It was not until I stormed into the ""managers"" office and demanded my key back did they offer to sell the truck at the originally agreed trade-in for cash. I would have walked anyway if I had not already driven 3 hours and spent 3 more hours in a stupid negotiation. This sort of treatment is exactly why car sales has such a horrible reputation.

Unethical to say the least. The first question I had was ""do you honor the Nissan VPP price""? The answer? ""I talked to my manager and yes, we do"". Then I proceeded to tell the salesman exactly what vehicle we found and wanted on the Fenton Nissan website. I then told him the VPP price and asked him specifically if we also get the Nissan rebate, AND the dealer rebate. He said...""YES"". I also told him we had a trade in and gave him all the info, including the payoff on the car. I specifically told him the car would have to be paid off during the deal to which he replied. ""I see no problem"". So after talking to him and being reassured THREE different times in three different conversations that my price with the VPP program and the rebates, and the trade in payoff would be our deal, I was reassured and basically they begged to come up there and make the deal. Within the next few days I received emails and phone calls from the salesman and finance manager (Nick) pleading with me to make the 120 mile trip to Rockwall. I called again to talk to the salesman to make sure we had a deal before we drove up there. He reassured me we had the deal. We made the trip. Guess what? That's right. NOTHING I was told on the phone was true. NOTHING. All the numbers had changed, and even with our excellent credit score, they had us on paper about $6k in the hole. Upside down on the trade in. $2500 down payment. NO dealer rebate. They didnt even want to honor the VPP price which is nonnegotiable from Nissan. Absolutely none of the verbal deal we made prior. This is after we both took the day off from work, and drove 120 miles to make what we thought was a great deal. Turns out it was a lie all along. Shame on Fenton Nissan of Rockwall.

When I got there the vehicle which I had requested “was just sold”.  But he had a very similar model to the one I had inquired about and it was at the same price.  Nonetheless I thought it was a good deal and confirmed that it was the same price; in his office/cubicle he had me sign a piece of paper stating that I would pay the price agreed upon. Five minutes later Mr. Henderson leaves the cubicle and his manager George Ramirez comes into the office/cubicle. At this point Mr. Ramirez decides to raise the price $5000+ and he wanted me to finance the car.  When I mentioned to Mr. Ramirez that Mr. Henderson had quoted a different price over the phone, the manager decided to speak down to me as if I were an idiot, saying “you have no idea what a good deal is.. we are trying to help you”.  My response was that he does not know me personally, his goal is to sell a car and IPAC is conducting dishonest business.  At that point he gets up angrily and storms out saying “I’m not doing business with you.”  I wasted three hours of my time dealing with this unethical organization. 
So I left and called Anicra Nissan, I asked if the internet advertised price was the correct price.  On Ancira’s website they clearly posted the costs both with and without financing.  I went in to Ancira met with the salesman, who had the car I spoke to him about ready when I got there.  Test drove the vehicle and had completed the transaction in a matter of two hours. The salesman even, helped me return the rental car I was driving.  The Ancira experience was the complete opposite of the IPAC experience.
Do Not waste your time visiting IPAC auto group they are out right dishonest business people; take your money somewhere else. Take your business somewhere else, certainly consider Ancira Nissan or another organization.

3929,15-Jul-13,"We had a bad experience because we had to drive 150 miles to get to the dealer ship in San Antonio, Tx. We had a vehicle in mind and we had discuss a vehicle by internet and received a price for that vehicle, so we were expecting that particular vehicle.  When we arrive they told us that that particular vehicle was not available and so we went for the second choice they send us by internet services and the copy of that same advertisement, but they told us that they were not able to respect the price given on the advertisement because we did not qualify for that price due to our credit.  So we had to keep that second choice but with a different price, and the reason for staying with that price is because my husband was not feeling fine and we just wanted to get out of there.  In my opinion,  we did not got the advertise price for the vehicle and that is call false advertisement!  A dealer should not advertise a price if they are not going to respect it !!!",1,83

They offered a horrible trade value well under KBB and then tried to lower the trade-in value after I took the car as a ""loaner"" while they were supposed to be getting a better trade value. Internet price was listed much lower than what they actually offered and there were no ""incentives"" in the final price.I finally took the new car back and am looking at purchasing elsewhere. Sad thing is, I have bought from IPAC for 20 years. Customer loyalty obviously means nothing to them.

3933,30-Dec-12,"Went to purchase a vehicle last night. Spoke with someone on the phone, Craig head of internet sales. Had money in hand and we were ready to buy. Craig was aware and gave us a drive out price of 22,218. We get there and Addam the Sales Manager comes in and says because we are not financing through Nissan that that wouldn't be the price. The price would be more. I said that Craig was aware we had money in hand ready to buy and gave us that price. Addam went to his boss (Name I don't remember) and came back and said could we go up $500 more. I said ok $500. We have a deal. He then comes back after speaking with his boss again and says no can do it has to be $1000. I was outraged and said I would walk. He said can you do 22,900. I said yes we all shook and he left again. They then came into start the paper work. Adam returns and says, no they can't do 22,900. We get up and walk out. They chase us down in the parking lot and belittle us over $300. Quote from the Finance Manager, ""Are you really going to let $300 ruin a deal?"" My reply, ""No sir you are. And it's not about the money it's about the principal."" I will never shop here again. I will never tell anyone in my family to shop here for a new vehicle.And first thing tomorrow morning I will be calling Nissan to let them know my displeasure.",1,83
3938,10-Sep-12,"Beware!
The Internet Price is not the price they start out with.  They revert back to the MSRP even though the internet price is much lower.  The LOW internet price is just to lure you in.  We drove 3 hours with the impression that we would deal with the internet dept. and not have to sit and deal with a salesman for 2+ hours.  The dealership also puts a manager in the cubical next to the one you are in to &quot;spy&quot; on what is going on.  If you have never been to the dealership you are led to believe that the person is just another salesman. I asked if we were being spied on and the answer was a nod yes.  After insisting on the internet price (taking 1 1/2 hours just to do this) the dealership finally agreed to the internet price.  We ended up walking out without the vehicle - did not like how they lured us in - 
We also walked out because they insulted me by offering such a low amount on my trade.  Yes, it had high mileage, but I feel the dealership was trying to make up for their &quot;loss&quot; on having to agree to the internet price.  

My dissapointment is that the dealership lures you in expecting the internet price when they have no intention of letting the vehicle go for that price.

In our case, I feel that the dealership only agreed to the internet price because I was going to give them this review, plus I am contacting TV/Radio Stations to see if anyone else has had this problem.

Lewis was very nice, only doing his job, but the overall practice of this dealership makes me cringe.  If you advertise a price, that is the price you should start out dealing with once arriving at the dealership.  You should not have to work for over one and a half hours to get back to this number.",1,83

He tells me GM was upset that salesman ""let me leave"" so they were offering me this low price just to keep my business. This is the reason I don't like buying used cars from a dealership.

He said he could get us a great deal so I asked what the price was and he would not give us a number just that they would work with us on it.  That sent some red flags because I want to know that informaion before we start serious discussions.  He never would tell us and sent in the finance man and he said it was $27,999 and then would not give us a fair price on our trade in.  When I got home I went online and looked up the vehicle and it was listed for only $23,949 so he tried to add an extra four grand to the price. Before he sent in the finance man I asked our salesman to look up the price on his smart phone and he said he could not find it listed which was a lie.  I could not beleive that they would not give us any prices on any vehicles only that they would work with us.  I feel we were brought in on false pretense and he never had the vehicle he said he did.  Did he think we would not look up the price to see if we were being treated fairly?

However, the price sheet brought back to me was roughly $3500 more than the price advertised online (which is why I came to your dealership...the advertised price).  Jaron explained the warranty that was added to the car, he also mentioned it was a way for the dealership to recoup some of the labor cost for prepping the vehicle.  After I told him I was not going to pay more than the advertised price, he got his manager.  His manager confirmed that he would not sell the car for less than the elevated warranty price.

After the director's departure, I continued discussions with Jaron, I expressed my displeasure of the bait and switch tactic.  Jaron began to tell me I was a bad consumer because if I didn't pay the elevated price I was preventing him from supporting his daughter.  This was the absolute worst sales tactic I have ever seen.

At this point I walked out of the Used Car building and went straight to NEw Car building asking for the GM.  I met a gentleman named, I believe his name was Carl, whom I explained my entire experience with.  HE left me for a minute, I assume to speak with Jaron and his team.  The GM returned and honored the advertised price.  I left with the vehicle I wanted.

After walking out, the sales manager and salesman came out to my car to get me to come back in so they could ""attempt"" to honor their online advertised price.

The next day I called the dealership and let them know why was the sale price change from $19,800 to $22,800 and they stated because there was a mandatory warranty that I had to purchase.

I let them know that they can't force me to purchase a warranty or service contract if I don't want to and they simply stated that it was too late I already agreed and signed the contract.

I was clear that was all I wanted to pay and if they couldn't do that as msrp is 25k then we could save each other some time. The salesman talked to finance and they said I should go for a test drive.  When we came back the salesman had me sign a form saying that if I got my price, then I would buy that night.  I had no problem with it.  They then gave me a menu of prices.  They tried to decrease my payments over a longer period of time which would have still got them msrp or more.  I said no.

The salesman went back and forth with finance and then had me sign another form with 25k listed again.  I said why do you keep writing that number down. He said don't worry it will change later they just have to put that number down so he can get it past the owner and that isn't the price and it will change. At this point, I felt like I needed a shower as this felt like a very dirty deal.

They then trotted out more new numbers.  At this point I wasn't sure when the number would change to the 21-22k. Long story short it never did.  I think I got about 700 dollars off msrp after they claimed they are only making 350 dollars on the deal and that they had to make sure the owner didn't see the paperwork.

4648,24-May-18,"I went to Toyota of Plano as it was the closest dealership to me that uses the USAA car-buying service. 
I emailed with a salesmen named Roberto, who gave me a quote for a Black RAV4 XLE.
They quoted me a price, and I set up an appointment to look at the car, and possibly even buy that day.
When I arrived, I was excited, because the salesmen said he does not push things on people that they don't need, like leather seats, add-ons, higher trims, etc.
However, when we went to look at the RAV 4's they had in stock, he ""couldn't find"" the black XLE we had discussed prior.
He showed me a bunch of other colors with different trims, and tried to convince me to like other colors, like blue or white, and then started trying to convince me that I should get the blue RAV 4 limited with leather seats and ""upgrades"" which include a cargo net/privacy screen at an extra charge... (funny, because he said when we first got there he would not do this)..
Then finally we found a black RAV4 XLE, and he led me to believe that was the one he quoted me for, so we test drove it.
I was super excited and ready to buy it.
Once we sat back down in his office, he went to financing to get total price, when he came back it was THEN that he told me this was not the vehicle we discussed, and it was about $5k more, which in his words, ""is really only like $60 a month - you can do it"".
I asked him why he did not have the car we had discussed prior, and he said that he had tried calling me multiple times today to let me know the car was ""about to be sold"" and I needed to come in immediately, etc. I told him I had not received one phone call, email, anything from him today.
I told him we will go home and discuss it, and also go to other dealerships to see if they have the car I want at the price I was quoted by USAA car-buying service.
After this, he warned me ""to be careful, because what a lot of salesmen do is tell you the price and say they have the vehicle in stock, then when you get there they change it up on you and don't have the vehicle or the price is more"" - I laughed at this, and told him ""oh, like you just did to me"" to which his reply was ""oh, but this time that really happened...""
Already having a bad taste in my mouth about this guy, I got up to leave, then he grabbed the price quote for the higher priced XLE from my hand, and said I could not take that.
I asked him why not, and he said that it is Toyota of Plano's property - and is not to be taken home, or shown to other dealerships. I then went to take a picture of it then if I ""couldn't take it"", in which he grabbed it from the table and said I could not do that either.
It was the most shady experience I have ever had at a car dealership, and I will NEVER go back here again and will always warn friends/co-workers to not go here as well.

I eventually went to Atkinson Toyota South Dallas and the 45 minute drive was well worth it as the salesmen gave me the price he quoted me via email as it should be. They even threw in free accessories at NO CHARGE. I refer everyone there now.

I don't know how I should start this, I have been a Toyota customer for the last two years and I visited multiple dealerships but I have never got such unprofessional and dis-respectful treatment like the one I got at Toyota of Plano

Long story short , i would never buy a car from this Plano dealership in the future no matter what.



My Sales experience:

I agreed with the sales guy on the pricing before i showed up in the dealership to finish the paperwork and walk out with the car but this is not what happened , what happened is one of your sales manager ""Carlos""tried to rise the price of the car 500$ on me despite the fact I already agreed on the price previously.
When I refused to pay any extra money above the price that I signed up for, he started acting rude and I cant believed things he said to me starting with "" i am the in charge person in here nobody in this dealership going to sell you a car if I decide not to sell you"" , I replied to him gently ""its true, its your car and its your dealership and I don't have control over that but I got a better deal from other dealers which I am going to sign up for if you are not going to sell me the car with the price that I signed up for""

He made it worse when he accused me of lying in front of my wife and kids when he said ""This is not true, you have never gotten a better deal before and you wont get any and if you are going to walk away and not signing up for the risen price that I am offering you then It wont be valid anymore , in other word -he was threaten me that he will rise the price.
The man accused me of lying in front of my family/ it was unbelievable.


This is where i told him "" we are over here"" and i am not going to buy any car from somebody accused me of lying and that was totally inappropriate - i cant possibly believe that those guys treating their customers like that.

Anyway, The moment i walked out of the dealership , I visited toyota of lewisville where I got a better deal as well as a treatment with ""respect"" much better than the one i got from Plano dealership , and btw; I made my purchase from there on the same day.

When the price was negotiated via email and phone, I decided to make my way over to the dealership and was basically lied to on the price that had been finalized on email. I was told that the price would be $1,000 higher and the interest rate would NOT be 0% when thats what was agreed upon with my discussions with John. I wasted 2 hours of my time at the dealership and walked out. I would never recommend anyone to buy their car from Toyota of Plano as they do NOT conduct their business with honesty.",1,99
4762,11-Jul-17,"I wish I can give 0 star if I can. 
Eric, one of the agent, called me and all he gave me is wrong information. Price was wrong, finance option was wrong.
I asked for drive out price on one of the inventories list in Car Gurus (Jetta 1.4 SE, automatic) and he gave me price. I asked for email with quote and didnt receive anything until I called them multiple times. Jeremy Harmon, Eric's manager, finally sent me the quote, which has the estimate with higher price than what he told me over the phone, with ""manual"" transmission.
I called Eric again and he said it is just typo and he will send updated one. I got the email and now the price is even higher than what is on the previous quote!!! WTH!!
I called Eric again and he said he will have his manager to call me (are you serious?) and his manager said there was system issue and price is listed lower than what it supposed to be (seriously,,). And he cannot give me 0 finance with that price even though they did state that in the quote.
Finally, they said I have to pay 2,000 dollar more than they told me over the phone + $$ more if I decide to go with 0 finance.
I bet it was and will be one of the worst experience I have ever had.
I am definitely not going to recommend this dealership to anyone!",1,100
4779,30-Jun-12,"I saw a new Passat for sale on their website and talked to a sales rep regarding the published online sales price. He confirmed it and encouraged me to come see it in person. I took a test drive and the rep touted all the car's features. We went to his office and he went to his manager's office to get the price (even though I thought I knew what it would be based on our phone conversation). The price he showed me was $3000 more than the online price- not to mention and additional $800 for all the features he touted- and he was incredulous when I asked him what happened to the internet sales price. He finally explained that the online price was for leasing, even though this was not stated online and he did not mention this when I asked him about it on the phone. I voiced my displeasure and he then had the nerve to ask me If I still wanted to buy it. I firmly said no and left right away. Ten minutes later-once I am home-  he calls me and tells me ""you won't believe it, I got one thousand knocked off the price for ya."" I tell him not to call me again as I am not interested in playing games and would not buy a car from Boardwalk even if they lowered the price five thousand dollars. Very disappointed in their misleading sales strategy and questionable business philosophy. ",1,100
4797,02-Feb-19,"I went in to look at a 2019 jetta they advertised for $15,381.  They had the exact car on the lot and tried to tell me that the price was without additional features such as the nitrogen in the tires and the key replacement, tint, and other crap.  It is no wonder that car salesman rate just slightly above below politicians and pond scum on the trust scale every year.  I then went to another dealer of VW's on 121 in Frisco (Hendrick) and they played no games and dealt with me professionally!  I am shocked at how anyone with a fourth grade education would fall for the stupid tricks and offensive attitude that was on display at the McKinney VW store.  This same family owns other dealerships and their reputation in the Ford business is the same and goes back years and years with dealer add ons, bait and switch, and other games.  If this is the way that it is on the lot then you know you haven't seen anything yet.  Just wait til they get you in the finance office and they try to tie you up like a pretzel with their fees and ridiculous games that bump the rates, or extend the length of the note.  ",1,101
4798,01-Feb-19,"After driving 4 hours to this store with the intention of purchasing a specific used vehicle from their inventory, my girlfriend and I were dumbfounded at the unprofessional way the final negotiations were handled.
The store reduced the internet advertised price on the vehicle days before our visit, and though the sales desk presented a worksheet with the advertised amount listed at the top there were additional 'Pro Pack' fees designed to 'recoup some money' (the Sales Consultant's words).  Additionally, not knowing how to handle a transaction with an out-of-state customer with different numbers on different offers indicated the store employees were not trained in that area.
The final straw was when another store employee came in and informed us that, even though we had arrived and test drove the vehicle first, 'someone else in the store has already pulled the trigger' and negotiations ended.
Needless to say we left without purchasing anything.
We would not recommend this store to anyone looking to purchase a vehicle.

4800,24-Sep-18,"Car Gurus advertised car $19881 but dealership charged $20876 plus additional $4500 in fees they implied were going to ""throw in gratis "". to seal the deal. but total cost $25295 with all the ""freebies""",1,101
4801,22-Aug-18,"Their sales process feels like a scam, smells like a scam and on top of that, they treat you like you are plain stupid, like they are doing you a favor!

We were ready to buy a new car. First, they dont tell you the exact numbers, we had to ask many times to be told what the exact interest rate was. Then, we run the numbers on a Volkswagen finance calculator and the rate they were applying was some 40% higher than the one we were being informed. That happened twice. I guess their finance people are really bad at their job or.... they think their customers are dumb.

Second, we were asking for specifics on the ""protection package"" that was part of the deal and they were doing all they could to not show us in clear terms what was covered. We were being coerced to sign the check for the down payment without seeing those details although we asked for those repeatedly from three different people. 

Third, and the last straw, the working paper with all the details on the deal showed the car had some 200 miles on it and when the final papers came, it had some 500. And we were sarcastically asked why we didnt check that by ourselves when we test drove the car! That's when we left.

This was by far the the worst experience I ever had with buying a car, I will not come back and will take my business to a serious respectfull dealer elsewhere.",1,101
4805,26-Sep-17,"I worked with Joe Velasquez. DO NOT LET THEM RUN YOUR CREDIT BEFORE YOU SEE THE TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE. THEY WILL ADD MORE EXTRAS TO MAKE THE AGREED PRICE GO UP.  I was told by Joe that we can get the total discount at $8,250, bringing the car to 23,885. When I drove 1.5 hr from Downtown Dallas to the dealership, I was given a completely different price, upper $25k almost $26k. Joe told me that in order to get the full $8,250 discount, I have to purchase $1,800 (3 oil changes) extra stuff that he did not mention about in his emails. He mentioned that the online website said that this $1,800 package was stated (we checked, it does not).  I also let the dealer ran my credit because I thought we already agreed on the purchase price and we are just looking at closing the deal. This is the nastiest thing I have ever seen a car dealer does. We agreed on a price, and then ran my credit and increased the price. I am incredibly disappointed and angry that I now have a hard credit inquiry for a price that I did not agree to at all.",1,101
4830,26-Sep-19,"As you can see from the other reviews, they advertise one price, waste your time, and then try to tag a bunch of fees on you.   Not only is it bad business, but may also be a violation of Texas law (43 TAC 8.250).  Highly recommend you do not buy from this dealer!  Don't trust this group!",1,102
4837,19-Mar-19,"Wow, I don't think I've ever dealt with such manipulative, unprofessional and deceptive people as I unfortunately had to at Park Cities Volkswagen. A sales person named Billy contacted me after I reached out regarding pricing posted online. Turns out I don't qualify for the pricing they deceptively posted and they very rudely told me they can't help that I don't qualify for offers in fine print(they weren't even in fine print) after several rude texts from Billy, I asked to speak to the sales manager, Brian or Jason , who told me basically the same thing, since I am not handicapped, military, recent college grad AND a first response I wouldn't get the discounts even though the price was listed online as actual price. He then proceeded to HANG UP on me! A sales manager. How's that for professionalism? I now understand why the staff acts like they do; they're only following the example of management. I'm not sure I know anyone who is handicapped, first responder, military, AND a recent grad. I was ready to purchase a new car from them TODAY and their complete lack of professionalism and business ethics made me realize I want nothing to do with them. Steer clear.",1,102
