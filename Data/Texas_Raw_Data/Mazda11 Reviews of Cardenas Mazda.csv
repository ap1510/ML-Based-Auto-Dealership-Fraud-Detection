0,"June 09, 2020","I live in the Chicago area and ordered a part for my car from Joe Ybarra in the parts department. He assured  me the part was in stock, verified it was not damaged, and shipped it to me the same day. He was very pleasant on the phone and was patient in answering all my questions. His customer service skills were outstanding and I appreciate the genuine concern he displayed through out this whole process. I received the part in excellent condition and I wanted to acknowledge everything Joe did to get this part to me.",5.0
1,"June 02, 2020","Excellent customer service. This is the third Mazda we purchase from Cardenas Mazda and fourth vehicle in all that we purchase from Cardenas Motors. 
We highly recommend them. Thanks to the Sales team Mike Piña and his Sales Manager Billy Mata for outstanding customer service. Also thanks to Rudy Garza in finance for making sure we received the best financing possible. They make buying a vehicle easy and stress free. Mike also went the extra mile to bring us the new vehicle to the SPI because we were on vacation and took the trade in so we didn’t have to leave the Island. That’s what I call excellent customer service. ",5.0

5,"June 25, 2015","The dealership had a wide variety of vehicles to choose from, and the sales and finance staff were quick, efficient, and well informed on their products and services.  The Cardenas dealerships offer great service after the sale benefits as well.  This was the quickest and easiest car purchase I've made in years.",5.0
6,"June 23, 2015","Good job for a small dealership. They do have all they need to show you the cars, finance and service your vehicle. They answered all my questions and definitely gave it a good fight to give me a comfortable price I was looking for. No hassle or hustling at all that you stereotypically get from dealership sales people.

Good job.",4.0
7,"June 17, 2015","From the minute I walked onto the lot to the minute I left with my new car I received the best service.  I was just going to see my options, but Mazda turned out to be an amazing choice. Every worker in the office took a personal interest in my sale and helped in anyway they could.  I had been to a competitor's dealership in the days before and the service did not compare.  Cardena's employees were gonna make it happen for me no matter what it took. They also weren't willing to just make a sale, they made sure I got the best deal I could financially. ",5.0

9,"May 14, 2015",Its always good to do any maintenance on the Cardenas Mazda dealership. The people and workers are always very attentive on what my car needs. They also check on whatever they think is also need and ask when to consider to fix the other issues or when I need to get that fixed. Price is very affordable to pay and always feel welcomed whenever I need help at any situation on my car. ,4.0
