1,"December 22, 2019",I have bought a Chevy three times and two of my children. It’s a nice place to check out some great cars or trucks. So stop on by and talk to Don.,5.0
2,"December 17, 2019","By far the best, most efficient, friendliest, and comfortable vehicle purchase I have experienced. My sales rep, Don, and his sales manager actually listened to me when I told them what I wanted, which is very rare in my past experiences purchasing vehicles. I have had experiences where it has taken days of back and forth negotiations when buying a vehicle, some to the point where I walked away and vowed to never visit that dealership again. Even the gentleman in the financing department was respectful of my time and had me in and out in a short amount of time. If anyone is looking to buy a new or used vehicle, at a dealership staffed with people who actually listen to you, pay attention to your needs and concerns, and respect your time. I would highly recommend ValMark Chevrolet in New Braunfels, TX. Regards, Tony Drabek",5.0

8,"September 20, 2019","2nd time I brought my Silverado in with a mechanical problem and 2nd time the service dept. correctly and quickly repaired! Andy Rubio was the service manager.

I had previously brought my Silverado to Sequin Chev service dept. and they said my bad vibration was hardly detectable and the jerking transmission shifts couldn't be repaired! I had seriously considered filing lemon law or trading my Chev for a Ford, costing me thousands! I brought the truck to Valmark and service manager knew exactly what the problems were and fixed both! Steve Hudson was the service manager.",5.0

42,"January 06, 2019","ValMark's collision center turned a family disaster into a significantly positive experience.  Our vehicle appeared to have been totaled.  My insurance made a payout which I assumed was the amount I  would get for residual value.  When I called Rita in the collision center to ask what steps I needed to follow to dispose of the carcass of what was.left.  I was surprised (delighted) to discover that based on my approval signature given when it was left with her that she had already mobilized the collision center to rebuild my vehicle.  Then, over the next month, she did all the necessary work to keep me abreast of progress and recoup additional monies from my Insurance company.  When finally she called to inform me that my car was completed, I must admit I expected there to be issues.  The car has been that damaged!  Instead, it was like new.  I couldn't be happier.  Would I recommend?  Absolutely!",5.0

92,"December 23, 2017","I had damage to the front end of my Chevy Traverse. Visited the dealership in 11/14 for an estimate.  I asked that they email me a copy of the estimate. On 11/20 I contacted the collision center and asked if they had completed the estimate because I had not received my copy.  I was told that they emailed it to Pinky's Trailer Park. I told them I didn't know who that was and the female rudely asked if I wanted her to send me another copy and verified the email address that I had given the estimator. I asked if the had received approval from the insurance company. The response as no so I called Lynx and inquired about the approval. Lynx rep told me that approval for repairs was sent to the dealer on 11/16 and they would contact the dealer to confirm. I called the dealer later on the 20th to inquire when I could bring in my vehicle for repair. Female told me that they were currently working on scheduling for week of 11/27 and she would contact when appointment was available. I didn't hear from her so I stopped by the dealer on 12/6 to inquire why it was taking so long to get an appointment. She said she would check and call me. She called later to set up the appoint time to bring my car in. She said she had an opening @11:00 a.m. on 12/11. I explained that I was scheduled for physical therapy from 10-11 and might be late. I asked if I could bring it in at 9 and I was told she already someone scheduled for that time. I asked what the issue was and she told me that there was a ton of paperwork that I had to sign. I advised that I probably be late.  Dropped the car off at 11:10 a.m. for what I was told would be a 2 day repair. I had an unpleasant exchange with the female and I commented that that I might as well be talking to the wall. Female called on 12/12 to tell me that the bumper cover would be painted on 12/13 and that they had discovered damage to the a/c coil and would have to order the part. Female called late afternoon on 12/14  to advise car was ready. Upon inspection of repaired area, I told the female that the paint on the bumper cover did not match the fenders.  She told me that painted plastic never matches sheet metal parts. I pointed out the rear bumper cover and the rear lift gate and how close the color matched. She stated that they didn't match and I told her that if she didn't think they match they the were a whole lot closer to a match than the front end. I recognize that Pearl White tri coat may be difficult to match but I felt that the bumper cover vs the from fenders were like day & night. Again she told me that there was nothing more that the could do. I was very frustrated and told them the that I wasn't happy, thanked them and left the dealership. On 12/18 I contacted Lynx to discuss my dissatisfaction w/the paint color. Adjuster told me they would contact the dealer to discuss the problem. Adjuster called back and ask me to take the car back to the dealer and discuss the problem with the Body Shop Forman. When I walked in I could see he was full of attitude. He told me that he read my response to a 1 question survey that asked if I was satisfied and I responded no. The survey asked for a comment to explain my answer and I responded that ""the staff was rude and incompetent and that I would never bring any of my GM vehicles to their collision center for repair"". He told me that there was nothing else to discuss and that we were done! I asked him if he would at least come outside and look at the mismatched paint. He told me the same thing that the female told me about plastic vs metal. I pointed to the mirror vs the door and he told me they didn't match I asked about the body side moldings vs the door and he told me they didn't match either. So we went to the rear of the vehicle and he told me that the lift gate and the rear bumper cover didn't match either. There was a Chevy Equinox parked close by with the same tri coat paint and I compared the color match on that vehicle he told me they didn't match either. He again told me there was nothing else he could do so I asked him if his final answer that he would not attempt to correct the problem and he told me yes. I left the dealer very upset because I knew they could do better. I called Lynx and told them about my visit. Rep said he would contact my insurance company for further input to help me resolve the issue. On12/20 my insurance co. sent their own adjuster to inspect the vehicle. His 1st response was that the bumper cover didn't match and said matching plastic vs metal might be difficult but they certainly didn't even try to match the paint. I told the adjuster I really didn't want to take the car back to Valmark. I am currently waiting to for a response from Lynx as to what the next step is to resolve my concern. I will again state that the staff at the Collision Center next counseling on their attitude and the importance of customer satisfaction.   ",1.0

95,"July 11, 2017","Appt at 9, told they might be able to check it out by the afternoon. Received a call that I need 1000 dollars of work done. Won't tell me if it's covered under warranty until I agree. Also said can't be fixed for a few days!",1.0
96,"July 06, 2017","I bought a new 2010 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 from Val-Mark Chevrolet in New Braunfels, Texas. The truck currently has about 78K mile on it. From the beginning there has a been a problem. It started out about every 15,000 miles the stabilitrak light would come on an it would go into reduced power mode, dangerous on the highway to say the least. 
After repeatedly bringing the truck back for the same problem, someone from GM contacted me after I raised questions and concerns in an online discussion group. To Chevy's credit, the woman who contacted me was able to extend the warranty. Since then it has been back several more times for the same issue. The warranty expired in December and lo and behold, last week the same problem reoccurred. When the service rep told me it was the sensor in the accelerator pedal I was not surprised, same old tired song. I told Steve, the rep, I was not paying for a problem that was not fixed.
I am told the problem is a sensor/accelerator pedal issue that make the stabilitrack light come on and the truck go into reduced power mode.  This has been harrowing for me in the past on the interstate as I tried to cross traffic and exit at 30 mph.  Since she works in town, my wife has been driving the truck and the same thing happened to her on June 8, 2017.  She was turning left across morning work traffic on an uphill grade when the power reduced and she was creeping broadside to traffic coming over the hill on a state highway.    Her words were, “Scared the bejeebers out of me.”   The pattern has been consistent, treat the symptoms but don’t fix the problem, which is a safety hazzard.  I took the truck in for service at Valmark Chevrolet on June 12 at 7:30 a.m., their first available opening.
The accelerator pedal/sensor has been replaced at least 4 times but the problem keeps recurring.  Since the truck was not ready the evening I was told it would be, I ask for the service manager to call the next day.  Justin, the “service” manager, called. I told him the problem had not been fixed and he said according to his records it had. I replied the symptoms had been treated again but the problem had not been fixed.  His comment was the “fix” lasted 16 or 17 months so it was fixed.  Val-Mark misses the point, there is an underlying cause for the same part to continue failing and creating unsafe conditions when driving.  In addition, this ongoing problem creates hardships to constantly be bringing the truck back. 
I contacted Chevrolet and the case, number 8-3045561864, has been taken over at the Executive Branch by a woman named Brittany.  She has checked and found that this problem is most often caused by a voltage discrepancy between two circuits.  As of today, the truck is still at the Valmark Service department with no further word as to when the problem will be fixed.  Valmark seems unaware of the inconvenience my wife and I deal with sharing one car for what has now lasted 3 and a half weeks.  Based on my experience, I would never recommend Valmark to anyone.

102,"February 21, 2017","In January, I bought a 2016 Silverado 2500HD. It started with Kirby's usual ""Hey, I have something you need to know about.""

I bought my first vehicle from ValMark in 1996. It wasn't until about 2003 when Justin Kelley arrived and instantly became my service writer and friend that I appreciated the value of the dealership. Justin saw to it that Donny Schumann became ""my mechanic."" Donny had been a science student of mine at Canyon High School ""a few"" years ago. 

The fun experience at ValMark really started when Kirby blew into town. He makes it fun to just stop by and say 'Hi"" and not get that jumped on ""you gotta buy a car"" feeling. He's not a car salesman, he's a car sales advisor. I have referred countless friends to Kirby and they all just love that guy.

I also need to add the impeccable Chris Young, who, if he sees you coming runs to hold open the door for you and always flashes that friendly smaile. He is a delightful person. Chris and Kirby probably sell more cars ""by accident"" than a lot of the salesmen do ""on purpose""

ValMark is lucky to have these guys on our team. They are not only the faces of ValMark, THEY ARE VALMARK. They all make it fun just to stop by and says ""Hi.""

They called me back in 10 minutes while I was still at the dealership and told me that the part I needed and the quote I got was way off.

We also had the privilege of working with Susan, your finance director. Again another awesome experience and very timely. We chose to go with the dealer financing because she was able to do better than my credit union which was amazing in and of itself. And her personable demeanor was special.

So as I said this was the best experience at buying a car that we've ever had. And this in large part because of Don. He is credit to your organization and a blessing to us.

What was amazing is that the wife never stepped foot on the dealership grounds. She hates doing the sales process when buying a vehicle. I was able to bring the vehicle home, have her appraise it and sleep on the decision. Even during the paperwork signing I was able to bring 2 pieces of paper home for her to sign and walla... her used 2010 Chevy Traverse has been delivered in time for Christmas.

My wife and I were in the area, attending to details regarding our new home.  As we attempted to leave New Braunfels to return to FL, our '07 Silverado had a difficulty.  I called Valmark Chevy, reported my problem to Josh who in turn recommended Fat Boys Towing.  After our p/u was safely delivered to the shop @ Valmark, Jim assigned Ray to check the vehicle.  After a bit or trouble shooting, it was determined that the 175 AMP Maxi Fuze had ""blown"" and after replacing it, all was well and we could depart the area to return to our home in Jacksonville, FL.
Every one involved was courteous and kind and worked hard to get us on our way back to FL.  We especially appreciated the attention and concern that Jim Robinson, Josh, Ray and the driver for Fat Boys Towing paid to our dilemma and got us on our way.
Jim recommended that we carry an extra MAXI FUZE however there were no more in stock at the dealership.  He then directed Josh to call a dealership along our route and have them set one out for us to carry as a spare. Josh contacted Seguin Chevy and they were happy to do so.  
All in all, though it was a minor problem, again we appreciate the response and attention we received @ Valmark Chevrolet and recommend them to anyone.

Since I had some negative car buying experiences in the past from a few San Antonio dealers, I was a bit of a sceptic at first when I made contact with Valmark.

Itook my 2008 Buick Lacerne to ValMark Cheverolet on 8/12/11 concerning vibration san noise.

Roger Bittner, my service representative for several years, greated me in a friendly and courteous manner as always. He accepted the car for service and found the motor mounts were broken.  Mounts were ordered and installed under warnty.

This did not solve the noise problem.  After checkin, Roger called to tell me the cost of repairs would be $1,055.00 to install new struts and mounts.  I told Roger that in view of all the problems I have with the car since new, I would pick up the car unrepaired around 5;30 P.M.

At about 3;30 P.M., Jim the service manager called to say that Roger informed him of the problem. With Roger in his office, they called General Motors concerning the issue, and General Motors agreed to cover all but $300.00 Dollars. The car was then repaird and picked up 8/23/11.

Roger Bittner is truly an asset to ValMark and its customers.

We tried to use a local dealer to save on time and travel expense instead of going out of town. BAD DECISION!!! Our local dealership was very unprofessional and the deal was just to outlandish for anyone in their right mind to accept. So we told them No Thank You and left. Yesterday we decided to call Valmark to see if we could work an agreeable deal out over the phone before making a lengthy drive to New Braunfels. Well needless to say our sales rep Julie was a very pleasant and knowledgable rep to work with. After giving her our needs in a vehicle and what model we were looking for she came up with exactly the best selections for us. We did all necessary paperwork over the phone and she handled everything in a timely manner and had us approved and ready to pick up our new Tahoe by the close of business that same day. We came in this afternoon and Julie (sales rep) and Susan (finance manager) had everything waiting for us. The entire dealership had outstanding customer service. Before driving our new truck off the lot Julie explained the vehicle in detail and pleasantly insisted that we call if we had any problems or questions later in the day.

Memorial Day was very memorable for our family.  We got hit from behind, and thankfully no one was hurt.  I called my insurance company and they recommended Valmark.  I was a bit hesitant, because my vehicle was not a Chevrolet, but tried Valmark out anyway.  I found they were friendly, caring, knowledgeable, honest, and professional.

FRIENDLY - John came out to immediately greet me.  And when I walked in the office, Amanda also greeted me with a hello and a smile.

CARING - John checked and followed up with insurance company for a larger vehicle rental that would accommodate our family; and said they would pay the difference if there was an additional charge.  Had the rental car there waiting for me and my children the day of repairs for our convenience.

KNOWLEDGEABLE - I had a past experience with the same kind of collision and had our vehicle serviced somewhere else, and had the paint chip and crack.  John knew exactly why that happened, and assured me their process was different and would last.

HONEST - John they would not put a defective part on any automobile, and it just so happened, one of the employees inquired about the return of a new auto part, that was defective, and was to be sent back because of a tiny blemish.

PROFESSIONAL - I was treated as a valued customer.  I was given a time when the part would be in, when the car would be fixed, and when I could pick up my car.

A couple of days later, my husband got rear-ended.  We had to laugh a bit.  If we decide to pay costs toward our deductable, we will not hesitate to take our vehicle back to Valmark Chevrolet Collision Center in New Braunfels Texas!!
I am extremely satisfied with Valmark and I will highly recommend them.

I actually first met Justin on a cold call while negotiating to purchase my first car after moving to New Braunfels. He was very knowledgeable and personable and took a strong interest in me and my entire family which extended beyond merely purchasing a car. At the time I first met Justin I had already made an offer on a comparable Ford, and he showed me how to purchase a superior Chevrolet for less money. But what was even better was his service after the purchase. Bottom line is that we were sufficiently impressed with Justin and by extension - ValMark-  we bought 3 cars from him within the first 3 months of meeting him. Since that time we have purchased and traded Suburbans and Tahoes more than once (and I never went back to the local Ford dealer - even though I actually had been biased in favor of Ford products up until that time).

His business and sincere manner is what I want when I have to purchase a car and I will continue to refer many as always to Val Mark. I live in San Antonio, and none of our dealerships compared to the service and the kindness that Val Mark did, and again it was due to Chris Young.
Thank you Chris",5.0
360,"March 31, 2011","I would recommend my best friends and even my Momma to use ValMark Chevrolet to purchase their next vehicle.  This was our most pleasant car buying experience by far.

We initially contacted ValMark about a vehicle we found on their website.  That vehicle was sold already, but Kirby told us to let him know what we need out of a vehicle, what we want, and then to let him know what our financials look like then he'd find the car that works for us.

There was really no hasseling us about stretching our budget this way or that to ""drive away in a new vehicle today!"".  We soooo appreciated the straight forward approach he took.

Kirby did exactly as he said.  He found us a vehicle we are very pleased with and that fits our budget.

ValMark showed us that they are about the customer and not the bottom dollar.  We'll gladly use them again & we recommend you do too!",4.8

362,"March 31, 2011","Excellent customer service.  Julie Flores did an outstanding job.  She helped for over two weeks decide on purchasing the Chevy Equinox.  She is very professional.  

Mark Stevenson is very professional with a wonderful personality.  I will recommend many to ValMark Chevrolet.  ",5.0
363,"March 30, 2011","I have dealt with this dealership and the Chevrolet dealer in New Braunfels before them for over 25 years.  I am in outside sales traveling by car Central & West Texas, and New Mexico. Having put 245,000 Miles on my first vehicle, another vehicle with 270,000 Miles, and my present vehicle has 143,000 miles.

658,000 miles without any road side mechanical breakdowns which I credit the service department, because of the preventive maintenance performed over those years. They have always been proactive to make sure my vehicle is always running at top performance.

364,"March 30, 2011",Research was done on the vehicle I purchased prior to ordering it.  I was given the website and details about the options to choose and I was able to create my own vehicle online. I was then contacted immediately by the dealership to place my order. Upon arrival I was sent a photo of the car and details about when I should pick it up.  At arrival at the dealership I was greeted with hugs and all the staff was very professional.  I am so happy with my new purchase!,5.0
365,"March 30, 2011","I have bought six Chevrolets from Valmark and every time I got a great deal with no hassels.  They have always given a very fair price for my trade in. They are upfront with the price without a bunch of back and forth talking to a bunch of people trying to pressure you into ad ons. I have bought many of other brands from other dealers and I always hate having to deal with the sitting and waiting around to get a good price for your new one and your trade in. But that has never happened to me at Valmark. Two of the trucks I bought they didn't have on their lot but they found the perfect one on another lot and did a dealer trade, so I was able to get their great buying atmosphere. Alot of dealers advertise that they are a "" No hassel Dealer"", but Valmark truley is a NO HASSEL DEALER.
 They have the best service department I have ever used!!! Justin Kelley is our service adviser. We still own four of the Chevrolets and they do all of our service work. I own two other brand trucks that I even have them do the service work on. I have had them work on Hummers, Mustangs, Nissans, International, Corvette & GMC. They might not sell every brand but they will work on it. I have told many of friends and customers about Justin's great service skills. He always calls and keeps you up todate on the progress and cost of your repairs. I have never had a surpise when I have picked a truck that there was extra charges that he hadn't told me about. It is nice to have great service after the sale. We just purchased a 2011 HD crew cab dually and love the truck!! I was even lucky enough to have Justin as our salesperson also.
  So if your in the market for new or used do yourself a favor and avoid the big city dealers & just go to Valmark and have a nice experence before and after the sell. Don't do like one of my employees did and get lured in by a free tv with your purchase & pay way to much and not get enough for your trade. Make sure to go to the service department and meet Justin Kelley so you can see what a great service department is like!!!!!!!!",5.0
366,"March 30, 2011","Best service dept in the area.  Always does a good job in taking care of our vehicle maintenance and repairs. Very friendly and always asks questions about the auto and its performance and what we expect from it.  I would recommend this dealership to anyone looking for the best in service, no matter what brand of car or truck they own.",4.8
367,"March 30, 2011","I can't tell you how many times they've been there for us (two GM vehicles) and have performed top quality work the first time.  Proof of their integrity is that I have a '04 Tahoe that has 162K on it and a '02 Yukon with 299K and they keep the maintenance on these vehicles.  Justin have gone above and beyond to make sure only work that needed to be done and at a very competitive price.
Thank you ValMark and Justin.

They have always worked to make sure that I received the best pricing and financing...Thank you!!!",5.0
369,"September 12, 2010","I recently had an accident and needed a new vehicle. I shopped around all the local dealerships and they just didnt give me what I needed regarding price, service, and confidence. I drove out to Valmark Chevrolet, to give it a chance. When I arrived I was greated by several employees then my salesman Zach came up. He explained to me my options and showed me a Chevy Malibu Lt that he had on the lot that was at the price I was looking for without losing the benefits of the cars accessories that I had wanted. All in all he was very professional, and knowledgeable about the car I wanted and purchased. I would reccomend this dealership to all my friends and family. Thanks again!q",5.0
370,"July 10, 2010","I have had my truck in this place two times for the same thing and no fix. I even paid for it yes I am walking funny. Never again. I will take it to another Chevy place. They lie about price to. They will tell you $79 to tell you how much it will cost to fix it but if you have two things wrong it will cost you $158. Do not forget they will not fix it the first time or the second time. I would just take it to some other place do not chance this place. They will also charge you the $79 even if they try to fix it.

371,"May 04, 2010",The Valmark experience was and always is awesome. My husband and I have purchased 3 suburbans and 2 trucks from Chris Young at Valmark and will continue to do so as long as we are buying cars. Service is awesome as well. We get our maintenance and oil changes done with Valmark. Never have had any trouble with them!,5.0
372,"July 31, 2009","This is the WORST dealership I've ever had the misfortune of visiting.  I say visit, and not dealt with, because I didn't give them business now, and never will.  They had ALOT of hidden mark up fees, were very rude, and when waiting in the service area, two salesmen were getting coffee and making VERY lewd comments about a female client that was in the showroom.  With a dealership like this, I can see why GM has lost so much business.",1.0
