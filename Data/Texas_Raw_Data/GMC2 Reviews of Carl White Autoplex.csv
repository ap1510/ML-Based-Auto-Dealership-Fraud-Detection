0,"September 11, 2012","This dealership went above and beyond for me. I had been treated rudely and puchy at other dealerships and a friend of mine knew a guy named ""Jason"" that worked here, so we came in and spoke with him about what I was looking for but unfortunately their current cars were over my price limit. However, Jason took our number and said he would call if he found anything for us and would keep an eye out. Well, no more than 20 mins later he called us and let us know He found me a 2010 Toyota Camry, and it was very fairly priced and very good car. It was a coworkers fathers car he didnt really have for sale before, but to try and give me what I was looking for, offered it to me. Now if that is not going above and beyound I dont know what is! I didnt not end up purchasing the car as it was still over my comfortable monthly payment range but I just wanted to share with everyone how impressed I was with this dealership and how hard they worked to give me what I was looking for.",5.0
1,"August 05, 2008"," After getting basically sent on my way by the rude owner of CenTex GMC in Mexia even though I had an appt.for service I made ten days before,I called Carl White GMC in Corsicana about getting my truck checked under warranty on an ignition problem,the service mgr.Rhonda told me to come on up and they would take care of it,well, I went straight up there and they got me in almost immediatly,diagnosed my problem ordered parts and got me back in the next day to install the parts. I would not hesitate to recommend this dealership to anyone needing warranty work and if they treat someone who didnt even buy the vehicle there as good as they did me I would sure recommend them if you are in the market for a new vehicle too.",5.0
