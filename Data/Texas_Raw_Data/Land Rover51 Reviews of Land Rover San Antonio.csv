0,"June 27, 2020","Two years later...UPDATE...I was initially pleased with my purchase and the salesman.  Now I want to sell my Landrover Discovery Sport and never purchase one again. Landrover San Antonio lacks repair support for their own vehicle brand. When I purchased my vehicle I wanted a black edition. There were none in stock. The Landrover Service department doesn't paint rims and grills. They use an individual (not a company) that comes to their site and does it for them. I paid Landrover direct for this upgrade. Two years later the paint job started peeling. Landrover said it was not covered under my warranty because they didn't do the work themselves.  An individual they hired did the work and the 2 year warranty he provides is up. Now my panoramic glass roof is cracked. Once again, I'm told that they don't do this work. That they don't work on glass at their service center. They have an individual (not a company) that does this for them. That I would need to get with him to get an estimate to provide to my insurance company.  I had also contacted glass replacement companies (Safelite etc.) in San Antonio.  All but one will replace the panoramic roof but I'd have to purchase it first and have it sent to their shop. This is way to much of a hassle to deal with.  I have a great insurance company (USAA) and purchased a ""Luxury "" brand vehicle but I am the one that is stressed out and doing all the leg work. I've worked in auto insurance and know glass roofs can be problematic.  I'm guessing this is why Landrover doesn't do their own because they do not want to warrant the work.  If I have this individual (not a company) do the work am I going to have the same problem 2 years from now like the paint job?! Extremely unhappy and went from 5 stars to 1 star.",1.0

2,"June 15, 2020","We waited over 5 months for a second key?! No staff member ever kept us up to date on the status or reason for the delay, until we called in asking for it on 5 separate occasions?! Each time stating 2 weeks more...but we finally received it! On the other hand, we took the vehicle in for tire service and the staff was outstanding! Greeted us, made us feel welcomed and appreciated, offered us something to drink, and kept us posted and completed our service in a timely manner, without a lengthy stay. The waiting room seating, however, is not reflective of the exclusive branding of Land Rover, the quality nor professional image. It is quite frankly pathetic and insulting! The  sales staff and service staff appeared well dressed and professional, but the care and quality of the waiting area was poorly decorated and poorly furnished with seating that was carelessly considered! We've sat in waiting rooms at a low grade hospital or clinic that looked and felt better?! If customers are sitting around in a waiting room for a dealership that sells Premium Quality Vehicles, expects reasonable consideration to providing a generously honest survey, I would expect that same feeling while waiting for my vehicle to be serviced. Not asking for Margaritas or Wine while you wait, but rather an atmosphere that provides comfortable luxurious seating, at the very least. If the inside of a Land Rover is luxurious with new leather lumbar seating, great surround stereo system, acclimated cooling and or heating and smooth quiet ride, I would expect for that same feeling to be transferred and felt throughout my every experience while visiting the showroom, regardless of waiting to purchase or waiting for service!! Otherwise, you begin the process of a false promise, and focus interest on just selling and moving on...The ""Product"" Sells itself, but the ""Service"" controls the demand!",3.0
3,"April 16, 2020",I stop by after work looking for an LR4 I was told they did have nay in stock but I was shown a a ford explorer. My wife and I both liked the vehicle and while we were considering the purchase we were told it was the lowest priced it town and shown other listings of similar vehicles. We were given the Car fax. The one thing we were not told is that the vehicle had hail damage and that is why the price was so low. it was late in the evening and the vehicle was not all the clean so I never noticed it. The dealer obviously knew about it and that it why it was priced the way it was. I didn't notice the extent of the hail damage until my brother in law who owns a car detail business detailed the car and started pointing all of the damage out. Do not trust this dealership!,2.8
4,"February 24, 2020","Our Sales Rep Jonathan was absolutely amazing and extremely knowledgable about their vehicles and their capabilities. What started off with a simple visit, ended up with my wife and I driving a new car off the lot! We didn't anticipate any purchases prior to our visit, but our vision of owning this luxurious vehicle, with the friendly and respectful character of Jonathan, truly convinced us that our time had arrived after waiting a whole year!!! The Test Drive through the lot obstacle course blew us away and truly sold us on the off road capabilities of the vehicle!!",5.0
5,"February 12, 2020","My ""journey"" with this dealership lasted over thirty days , I know them well ! My sales person was Steven Likens, he was patient with me and of great help in my purchase of this car. I flew into San Antonio to pick the car up, Steven met me at the airport, drove me to the dealership where he had most all the paper work completed. Minimum time required before I was driving off the lot, nice experience. ",5.0

7,"January 19, 2020","I couldn’t have asked for a better buying experience. From the very first text to signing the papers, to a few days after delivery, I’ve been surprised at how much this dealer seems to care about it’s customers. Will definitely be back again even though it’s a 4 hr drive from where I live. I guess the dealers in my area don’t care about the experience as long as they sell cars. Thanks Amanda and the team at LR San Antonio! ",5.0

9,"December 27, 2019","Service department is TERRIBLE! They never pick up the vehicle as scheduled and when you call, nobody knows who did the “scheduling error”. The first time they scheduled my service, they did not show up to pick up my vehicle as scheduled. It took them TWO WEEKS to get the scheduling error straightened out. This time, again they don’t have my vehicle on their schedule. When we advised the service manager, Skyler, that we received a confirmation text, he stated that it was from the Boerne location. I advised him that the text included their dealership address. He had no answer to this “error” since he is “new into the brand”. My vehicle has been unusable for two weeks now and it will most likely take them another two weeks to get the scheduling error fixed. I’m heading elsewhere for my next Range Rover HSE long wheel base. ",1.0
10,"November 17, 2019","Selected vehicle, signed buyers order, filled out credit application as well as disclosures on vehicle's condition. We waited approximately 2hrs and a sales manager came to visit us stating that we couldn't complete the sale due to the time of the afternoon and not being able to get a hold of our bank for a validated payoff of trade in our vehicle. Also preceded to say that if we wanted to accept their higher rate interest we could buy the car that evening. We declined, he then stated that they couldn't hold our vehicle and that they had other appointments. I had already filled out paper work as stated earlier; to include a document that stating that if my payoff was higher that I would be responsible for any delta in dollar amount. We received a call on the way home from Mr. Ed Noriega attempting to apologize for the tactics and then later restating that if the car was there Monday he would sell it to us. I got a video message from the sales rep Dana, stating the car was sold later that evening. My complaint is that because they couldn't sell me at a higher interest rate they sold the car underneath me even after I provided my social security and personal information.  Stay away from this dealer. ",1.0
11,"October 14, 2019","I recently made a purchased a used vehicle from SA LandRover and had the BEST Salesperson, Dana Napier; and Service Rep, Rhonda Flores.  Even though my vehicle wasn't a ""Land Rover"", I was treated as if it came straight off the show room floor.  The patience and attention given to me was AWESOME.  I can truly say ""The Cavender Way is the Only Way"".  If you are in the market for a Land Rover/Range Rover, please rush right over to SA Land Rover and ask for Dana Napier.",5.0
12,"October 08, 2019",Dana Napier is a wonderful Salesman. He was very professional and polite at all times. He went the extra mile in meeting my needs when I purchased the RR. ,5.0
13,"October 02, 2019","Recently bought a 2019 Rang Rover Sport from Amanda. Since my first phone call Amanda has been in constant communication. She even went as far to contact me in the weekends to ensure everything was fine. Your dealership needs more sales folks like her. She goes above and beyond. She exceeded all my expectations. If you come to this dealership ask for her. She will take care of you even after the sale is done. Amanda, gets 10 stars. Super Awesome!!",5.0
14,"September 18, 2019","We were in contact with Dana for about a month before booking our test drive and consultation for a new 2019 Velar. Throughout the whole process he was able to make everything feel unique and custom-tailored through his use of videos and personalized messages/regular phone calls to get more information on the vehicle and the services he could provide us. Once we made it to the dealership, it was clear that he was just as thorough in person as he was in all of the emails/texts/phone calls -- the whole experience, from the location of the test drive and demonstration of the vehicle's features to the attentiveness and friendliness of the staff in the dealership, was top-notch. Even after buying the vehicle, we still receive regular check-ins concerning the car and our satisfaction with both Dana the dealer and the dealership itself. It was a great experience all around and I would highly recommend this dealership, and more importantly to work with Mr. Napier, to anyone interested in Land Rover vehicles!",5.0
15,"September 10, 2019","The whole process of getting my new RR was without a hitch. Cameron is a wonderful asset to Land Rover San Antonio! He explained everything in detail! My experience with Stephen in finance was excellent. He is knowledgeable, courteous, professional, and timely!",4.6
16,"July 18, 2019","I wanted to surprise my wife with a 2020 Evoque for our 35th anniversary. There were few to be had and none in San Antonio with the features I wanted. My salesman, Cameron Tang, went above & beyond to find what we wanted & in time for our anniversary.",4.8
17,"July 11, 2019",I'm very happy with the level of performance of the service department at Cavender Land Rover. I always get prompt and friendly service.

19,"July 09, 2019","Mike Wilson, Service Manager and Christine Borquez, Service Advisor were extremely professional and supportive of my concerns regarding the repairs of my 2014 Range Rover.  Being my 2nd Range Rover purchased with Cavender Land Rover, I've only till now experienced the level of professionalism and servicing that one would come to expect of a Land Rover dealership.  Appears that a house cleaning took place.  Thank You Cavender Land Rover.",5.0
20,"December 30, 2018","I highly recommend Land Rover San Antonio and their wonderful sales staff, especially Rowena Zambrano. She is extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and professional. It was simply a great car buying experience overall. I was quite pleased that Ed the Sales Manager came out to great us in the showroom. Other Land Rover dealerships please take note! Also Jake from finance was bright and a straight shooter. We drove two and a half hours to the dealership and we are so glad that we did. The dealership is bright and comfortable with a great selection of SUV’s.  I highly recommend it without hesitation.",5.0
21,"December 27, 2018",We purchased a Land Rover sport and the salesman we dealt with was one of the best I have ever worked with.  He treated us like family.  Next purchase I will definitely look for him! Thank you Dana Napier!!,5.0
22,"December 12, 2018","I recently inquired about a vehicle at this location online. The Sales person Johnathan Martinez responded quickly and even emailed a personal video of the vehicle of interest. I was very impressed and I even submitted an online application. After that there was no return communication from Mr. Martinez again. The credit companies reported that they did run my information. After my review posted online someone did  respond to it, ""Hello, could you please provide me with your first and last name so that I can have someone reach out to you. We apologize for the wait."" I what was asked and again I didn't receive any call back or any other communication.",1.0

The whole experience was fantastic from beginning to end but.... Our salesman, Anton was exceptional, he listened to our wants & needs,  provided great options which made the whole process easy!!!  Thank you, Anton!!! We will definitely send our family & friends your way!!!!",5.0
24,"July 26, 2018",The furst impression upon  entering the well appointed  and comfortable  dealership is a  tangible sense of calm and professionalism. Everyone is courteous and welcoming. My sales person ( Steven )  was welcoming and genuinely personable.. My car purchase is an experience that I would set above the many car purchases I have negotiated in my car buying lifetime. I would suggest that you strongly consider these professionals when car shopping.,5.0
25,"June 12, 2018",We had an excellent experience at Land Rover of San Antonio with Tony Osburn (Sales Guide) and Scott Baker (Service Advisor).

27,"May 24, 2018","I bought a preowned BMW from Anton and realized it was too small for me.  After the patience of a Saint, I ended  up purchasing three cars from Anton within a month.  He took time with me and assessed my wants and needs.....however, I went with my WANT and not really what I needed.  I ended up buying the car I have always wanted, a Range Rover Sport.  The car is amazing and Anton has been spot on with follow up.  I feel like I have made a friend for life and everyone at the dealership has made me feel like family.  I highly recommend Anton Malish!",5.0
28,"March 29, 2018",The dealership employees ignore ledge that their used car manager is scared of trade-ins and continue giving low bids on trades. Buyer beware. Do not buy at this place if you have a trade-in.,1.0
29,"March 27, 2018","Went in to compare Discovery and Velar.  After hands on research, purchased the Velar. Steven answered  all my questions and spent time orienting me on the new vehicle, making sure I understood all the tech and operational features.  The dealership also has a dedicated Tech guy, Isaiah, who specializes on the Range Rovers vast technology.  Isaiah even offered to come to the house to provide additional instruction and programming.  Steven followed up in a couple of days to ensure all is well with the new vehicle.  Although another employee assisted at first, some of his info was incorrect including the purchase of dealer add-ins.",5.0
30,"February 23, 2018","I purchased my new Land Rover two months ago and they still haven’t sent me my plates. Jake from finance said they won’t send them until they receive our full down payment. This down payment is something we obviously paid for at the dealership, prior to leaving with the car. We used a debit card and their card processor. The funds left our account within minutes. Here we are, two months later, and they are still claiming they never received the funds. Jake called and asked us to send him proof that the funds left our account, so we did. He said that should be sufficient enough. Then, after still not sending our plates, he asked us to call the bank and see where they sent the money. My husband and I both called he bank separately and they told us they followed the money trail to Land Rover. We even tried to phone call in Jake with the bank but he was “busy.” After completing his second request, they still won’t send us our plates. They have apparently figured out that the money is stuck somewhere between the bank and their credit card company, which is out of my hands, yet they STILL wont send me my plates after we have repeatedly done what they asked of us. I should have never gone to this delearship and purchased this car. I regret it every day. ",1.0

38,"May 02, 2017","I went to this dealership to look at a new vehicle - in the $140,000 bracket,I had already bought a vehicle here so I knew their tactics however I was still surprised at just how little they cared about a sale.
They first claimed that my car which I bought of them 3 years early was unsaleable because it had a factory recall which they couldn't fix, then when I queried this they made a ridiculous low ball offer, bare in mind this was potentially a $140K sale.
I knew that there were Land Rover incentives on 2016 vehicles that were still in stock, when i asked about this they at first denied it, then were evasive and wouldn't quote accurate discounts or prices.
Finally I called their bluff and went to another city and bought the vehicle i wanted, got all the rebates available and $5,000 more than they offered me in San Antonio, with the rebates and the better trade in I was able to save over $13,500 or more than 10% of the vehicle price.
I just don't understand them, you would think that dealership would want to A/ retain customers B/ get new ones but here they simply think if you have enough money to buy a Land Rover then you are rich enough to be mugged, well in my case that's not the case.
I will say on the service side, they are generally OK, there main object is cash in not customer value but most dealerships are like that, generally they are not bad.

We traded in our BMW Z4 and were looking for a safe, sports utility vehicle.  Amanda closed the deal when she took us on the off-roading terrain and really showed us what the land rover Evoque HSC could do.

40,"January 13, 2017","Cavender Land Rover sold us a certified Range Rover Sport and we later found out it had been wrecked with considerable damage. We filed a lawsuit and they settled.  their ""excuse"" was that the car was not fixed by land rover so they did not know, but it was fixed by Cavender's body shop and when that came out they settled.  Beware - they will lie to you if you let them. ",1.4

This is a total rip off. The salesman gone beyon puffing when he made promises that the vehicle holds their value. I have spoke to manager Mr. Noriega and to Mr. Bill Cavender / owner.

When I got home I tried to open the sliding sunroof I had ordered. There was no sunroof. I called the dealership and advised them that the car as not as I had ordered. 
After delaying me for three more months they had the nerve to tell me that they would order me another vehicle and I would have to trade mine in and take a loss.
Beware of the fraudulent tactics of this dealership. My advice is not to do business with Land Rover San Antonio or any other Cavender dealership. I could have had a better experience at a low end used car dealer.",1.4
47,"February 15, 2016","it would be nice if y'all could admit fault about not fixing the right thing on my car the first time instead of making me waste 1k for nothing. I had took my car in for a noise and I was told it was my breaks and rotors even though I told the service guy I had just got them fixed a few months back but insisted that was what was wrong with my car since it was after market breaks.....so when i get my car back it was still making the same noise....So i took it back again and voiced my opinion to the service manager who told me 2 things were wrong with my car and that was one of them even though no one mentioned what the real problem was until I took the car back and was inspected for almost a week that time...but the service manager said the mechanic had 20 plus years of experience and does not make many mistakes...If that was true then they should have had what was really wrong with my car the first time I took it in and not told me about this ""new"" problem after taking my car back when it was the original reason I took the car in to begin with but the service manager was beyond rude to me and was speaking to me like I was a child...I tried to complain after the conversation but the receptionist told me there was no one higher then him in a position to complain too. So I sent my sister to return the rental and pick up my car because I could not believe how i was spoken too and then she talked to him again and agreed to fix my car and only charge me for the part and not the labor which is still not ok with me because I wasted $1000 on something that did not need to be fixed. I should have been reimbursed for their mistake...I did ask to get my old breaks and rotors back so I can have them inspected by someone else and all of a sudden they were no where to be found... I would never expect this treatment at a Land Rover San Antonio dealership...talking to your clients like they are children and with the disrespect that I was treated with is inexcusable especially when paying these kinda prices for these cars that are not cheap at all and I have never dealt with a company that made the client pay for their mistakes or a company that cant even own up to what they did wrong but try to belittle me instead.#LastTimeIWillEverBuyALandRoverInMyWholeLife",1.0

49,"January 16, 2015","Land Rover of San Antonio aka Cavender Land Rover is the worst dealer for such legendary brand. I had my first episode with them in Nov 2014 when it took a while for the extended warranty to approve a claim in access of $4000 repair that Land Rover SA ""recommended"" for my LR3 vehicle. The service director called me and said ""RETURN THE LOANER OR I'LL CALL THE POLICE and report the loaner car as stolen"", and I should add that my LR3 was not ready nor repaired, it was just sitting in the rear lot waiting for the warranty adjuster to approve the claim. I had to give the dealership a bad survey to Land Rover NA for such rude and reckless behavior.

JAN 2015, I took my Range Rover for service appointment that I booked 2 weeks in advance in order to get a loaner; guess what: I was blocked from getting any loaner car in retaliation for my bad survey from Nov 2014.. I went to the General Manager Rick Holder and asked why have I been blocked from getting a courtesy loaner? he answered: the owner (Cavender) blocked you and your wife from getting a courtesy loaner car and I can do nothing about it. 

I have to say that staff (service writer, reception, loaner desk, etc..) have been always friendly but upper managers think they are the children of God.. They are rude, obnoxious, have no manners nor courtesy dealing with Land Rover clientele. 

I will NOT BUY a Rover from this point on due the this poor service. I already started my 2015 by trading my LR3 for another brand. The Range Rover is next and will be the last Rover I owned.",1.0

They called me back once they verified availability and we scheduled the appointment.  addtional work completed was covered under my warranty but due to the holiday, I had the loaner car longer than expected.  Staff are always friendly.",5.0
