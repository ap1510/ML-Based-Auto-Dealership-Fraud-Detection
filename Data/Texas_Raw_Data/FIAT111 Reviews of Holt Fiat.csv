0,"November 06, 2016","I purchased my 2017 Fiat 124 Spider in Austin just a little over 1 month ago. My first trip out of town was to Dallas for the Adele concert. So excited about it all. As soon as we got into Dallas we had car trouble with all kinds of instrument lighting going on. I am very happy to say it did not strand us on the busy I-35. But we could go no faster than 30 mph. Safely off the freeway, called for roadside assist, then I called Holt Fiat of Hurst as this was the closest business for this service. This was over 30 miles away. Around 4:30pm I called to tell them my situation and that I would need a loaner car. Had these tickets for concert since Jan. Marcus assured me there would be a Fiat 500 for our use. Due to 5pm traffic and distance we had to drive I was afraid we would not get the towing done by them closing at 6pm. So I called my Austin Dealership and they gave me the general managers mobile number. When ""Mr"" Dhruve, GM returned my call he states there was no car to loan. Well, do I need to tell you what I said after a brand new car breaking down in traffic, freeway, under 1,000 miles and it being my very first out of town trip???  He states this without even discussing it with anyone else as far as I know. I told him I was promised one by Marcus.  Then I had a few more choice words for him. He then states ""if he promised you one,  then we will find one!""  Happy ending, we got a loaner car thanks to Marcus and for Sean staying after 6p to see we got it. Oh, we got to dealership at 6:03. So kudos to great customers service from Sean and Marcus. Mr. Dhruve, I don't know how you ever got your title with your poor customer satisfaction. And this not so great rating was ALL due to ""Mr"" Dhruve.",3.8
1,"November 03, 2016","Holt Fiat of Hurst should be happy for the one star! These folks are con artists and like to use the ol' Switch and Bait routine. BUYER BEWARE!! I found a 2015 Fiat 500 online listed at $9489. I drove over an hour to see the car and of course fell in love with it. I took the car home over the weekend and exchanged several emails with Dominick and Darrell regarding the price. I was told my price would be ""internet price + TTL"". It took three tries to get the price of the TTL and finally was told by Darrell it would be $1032. I talked back and forth with Darrell and explained that the TTL seemed high and that I was only willing to pay $600. He said that was fine he ""did not want to loose my business over a couple of dollars."" So I went and got a certified check for internet price of $9489 and TTL of $600 and just before heading back out to do the deal all of a sudden I get a text message from Dominick that the internet price went from $9489 to $9968 and the TTL would remain at $1032 so I needed to bring $11,000 instead of $10,089. He stated the change was due to a mistake that was made. I understand that mistake can happen, but why should I pay for their mistake??? Needless to say I told them to come pick up their car. I refused to play their game. ",1.0
2,"September 07, 2016","I went in the dealership with an impossible situation. I just had a car wreck three weeks ago. I had liability insurance. My insurance would not help me get another vehicle. Therefore, I went out on a search for a new car myself. All the car lots gave me an overpriced down payment. This dealership gave me my car for $100 down. Cody Miller was my dealer and he had Outstanding Customer service.

Thank you Holt Fiat of Hurst",5.0
3,"September 06, 2016","I had a great experience with Holt when I bought my first car, so I had to come back for my new car after ten years and they were awesome! They answered all of my questions and found me a car that fits me and my finances perfectly! Definitely recommend Holt Fiat of Hurst! ",5.0
4,"August 26, 2016",I went in with an unsafe and unreliable car and Samuel and Cody were able to give me a reliable 2016 Fiat 500x for my children and I. They were very kind and helpful. I am very satisfied with my vehicle and the deal they got me. I have never received such great service before at any other dealership I have went before. They even called me a few days later to check on me and see how I was liking my new vehicle. I would definitely recommend this dealership and most importantly these two agents Samuel and Cody.,5.0
5,"July 06, 2016","After having a terrible experience at Holt in Arlington a few years back, Holt Fiat had a car I was interested in..I went in, explained my experience and Manuel Hernandez expressed an excellent buy this round. I have to say I am impressed, they got me in the car I wanted, gave me way more for my trade in than I expected, leaving me with a  minimum upside down cost. I had some additions made to the car I purchased, Manuel agreed to have that done for me for part of the buying deal. Him, the service manager, and the complete staff I have dealt with have went above and beyond, to stay in communication with me, and to me..thats a big deal. Glad I decided to give them another shot, I will definitely be back on the next car (as long as Manuel is there still). One of the best car buying experiences I have had, I am very pleased!",5.0

7,"June 23, 2016","My family loves our Fiat and Hurst Holt Fiat does my servicing because they have always been great! Even though I purchased my Fiat from somewhere else... I was at the Hurst Holt Fiat for an upgrade from my 2 door Fiat 500 Pop C for one of the 4 door Fiat 500 X. I was treated like family from the moment I came onto the dealership! Low pressure, easy going staff. Dominic was my salesman,  Dhruv was the sales manager and Ben did the financing. Dominic was very attentive and got me in the right car for my family, Dhruv got it to the right price for my budget and Ben made it make sense to the bank! I'm incredibly pleased with my purchase. My trade in was well received and they didn't spend any time chewing me up about the mileage or the dings and scratches! They gave me a new car for mine and I'm not upside down on my payments! Thank you Hurst Holt Fiat, Thank you Dominic, Thank you Dhruv and Thank you Ben! You guys are Awesome and this Fiat 500 X is Awesome! Thank you, thank you, thank you!

9,"June 15, 2016",Horrible customer service. They scam and trick  you into buying broke cars. No one seems to have an answer. I want my money back! DON'T GO HERE!,1.0
10,"June 10, 2016","I had a HORRIBLE experience with Holt in Arlington a few years back and I will never go back, I explained this to Holt in Hurst, and Manuel assured a great experience this round as he was great to work with. I did by another car with the promise to add a few things, THIS is where the issue was at in Arlington, after the sale, it went downhill. As long as the rest of experience goes as planned, this would be one of the best experiences at a dealership, but I will be sure to leave another review upon services complete. So far so good

18,"January 25, 2016",I appreciate that the MOPAR Express Service is closer to my home than my dealer.  They even found a leak which I took back to the Jeep dealer for warranty repair.  I have had the 2014 Patriot serviced three times here and am satisfied. The price and time is very competitive with those quick lube centers. Price is actually better for synthetic Mopar oil.  This very facility was my old Saturn dealer which I liked very much.  The spirit of service lives on at Holt Fiat!,5.0

35,"September 10, 2015",From the very start I was working with Jessie.  He went so far out of his way for me to make sure that I was in a vehicle. He kept me in the loop to let me know what was going on while I was waiting to get approved by the bank and was very professional and knowledgeable of all the Fiat's I didn't have to wait that long and he made me feel comfortable from the start! e came through for me and I even got to take the car home that night before it actually got to purchase it which was really nice to see how it drove. He deserves a promotion for what he did for me! I love you Jessie for giving me my freedom to really move around where ever I want now. I feel like a confident woman again thanks to you!  I want you know how much he really went out of his way for me; he even picked me up with his personal Fiat in Fort Worth were I live a 30 min drive from Hurst. Wow!

In fact a former employee told me that they were trained to lie from the very beginning. From the exorbitant mark up on vehicles, to the lies about everything....Oh so  - and  - so (sales liar no 1) is on his way...lies, oh he is only 10 minutes away  - 2 hours later he saunters in ""oh my kid was at the doctors""  Lie!  later told that he doesn't come in till noon.

39,"July 15, 2015",Alexandra was awesome and picked up on every small detail of our conversation.  She was very knowledgeable and professional.  It was nice to converse with a female car consultant and they were not pushy at all this visit.  She actually heard us say we liked a random car that drove by and brought one over that we loved instead of what we thought we might like and it was great. I have a medical condition and she was able to pick out the features that would aid my condition and make it easier to be in the vehicle.   ,5.0

41,"June 23, 2015","I was on their website and I found an inexpensive used car that I was interested in for my daughter.  I called and they said that they still had it, so I drove out to take a look.  After a test drive I told the salesman that I was ready to buy.   I told him I wasn't interested in financing and would be paying cash.  He went to talk to the manager and came back with an amount that was nearly double the rate on the internet.  I pulled up the website on my phone and showed him.  He went back to the manager.  A few minutes later he came out with another guy who told me that they wouldn't honor the internet price. Said it was a typo.  That they already took that price down but i could take the money I had with me and use it as i down payment on this vehicle or another.  Whats interesting is that 4 days later its still on their website at the lower price.  Its pretty obvious what they are doing.  Especially if you look at some of the reviews on Cars.com that tell a very similar story to mine.  ",1.0

51,"March 19, 2015","I have been looking for a new vehicle for over two weeks. I didnt really know where to go so I asked around. I was told of two dealerships and proceeded to see what they would be like. Instantly I knew when I arrived at Holt Fiat that I would purchase a car from them. I was seeking a Dodge Challenger which has been a car I have wanted for a while. Johnathan worked hard to try and make it happen but, was also able to give me a couple different options just in case the price was too steep.  Before I could even say no to the Challenger he had already pulled up a 2013 Nissan Altima. I've always liked the cars but, never considered driving one until yesterday. Long story short...I took it. He was a good person to work with and the finance officer was very detailed in the process. Great job fellas!",4.8

53,"March 15, 2015","My husband and I have wanted to buy a car for a few years now. New car new life. We noticed that all these cash cars are breaking down too quickly bad on gas and losing us too much money. But then we had a baby and a safe reliable vehicle is even more important. And I also got a new job that requires a lot of driving. We went from dealership to dealership and no one could help us because I don't have any credit, and my husbands credit is very low. We are also very young and insurance is expensive. We needed to find a dealership that could help us get a low enough cost. 

JJ is wonderful. He was patient, he looked at all our options and we went home in the most beautiful car! A car I couldn't even dream of driving, and WE CAN AFFORD IT! We told him cheap, family friendly, and gas efficient, and if possible pretty and red. he got us all those things and more! I am so happy we did this.  ",4.8

60,"February 20, 2015","I just bought a Fiat from Paul Peterson at Holt Fiat. Let me tell ypu that I used to hate buying cars. Until last week. I just dislike the whole dealership, new car purchase experience completely. I told Paul that. He promised a painless experience.  I laughed, feeling amused, but surprise of all surprises, Paul Peterson had me in and out of there in an hour. I mean from walking in, test driving, and financing. I would have said it was impossible. I told Paul that it couldn't be done. Guess what. Yep. I was wrong and I admit it.

I love my car and I am still in shock. I just never walked out of a dealership this happy. Paul was awesome. His manager and the finance guy were amazing, too. No kidding. Go to Holt for your next Fiat. Ask for Paul if you have ever been traumatized by dealers before. He will make you feel great, save you time, and save you money.

64,"February 14, 2015",We bought a 2013 Dodge Dart Limited through Alex. She was phenomenal! She sets the bar high on being a car salesmen/woman. She did everything in her power and jumped over so many hoops for us even though we had expressed our concerns and left thinking we wouldn't find what we wanted through them but boy did she prove us wrong!!

As Elijah went to grab the Keys from the Main office she snooping and doing research on a Dodge Grand Caravan which was sitting next to the Journey. So she drove the Journey and returned to ask Elijah about the Van she drove it and instantly fell in Love. Elijah worked his magic got us to right where we needed to be payment wise and to top it all off made sure it was taken through make ready, got us an oil change, and didn't Hassel us or didn't just try to make a sale.

66,"February 08, 2015","My initial opinion of this dealership is 5 star.  I had test driven a fiat 500 abarth at a competitor used dealership in Grand Prairie, and after leaving decided to just drop in to this dealership on way home.  Upon walking around a few minutes a very pleasant salesman approached. Elijah was very nice and patient with me. Told him what I was looking for and He introduced his manager Drove.  After a few minutes of chatting Drove pulled the trial car around. A new left over 2013 cabriolet abarth. With all the options I would of ordered it with had I ordered one.  Now this car is a new 2 yr old car.  Was used as a service car and has 4500 miles.  After a quick negotiation process, I feel they did everything in their power to earn my business that day. While process did take a little longer than I had hoped but all car transactions seem to take longer than they probably should. But I digress.  Part of my negotiation was a maintenance plan that he proposed which I think is brilliant if them.  I will now get to know them and see how well they support their customers. So as long as things keep going smooth, I'll be very happy and keep this 5 star rating.  If not I'll revise my reviews. ",5.0

I also requested (and they agreed to provide) an oil change and tire alignment as part of the purchase.  Also I only received 1 set of keys to the car.

I called back the day after I purchased the car to verify the service records with the Service Manager.  He said the only thing they were instructed to do was to was to remove a piece the MOPAR EVTS equipment.

Called back and talked to the manager (Zack) about this issue.  He said the ""equipment was not part of the deal"".

78,"August 11, 2014","I was making plans to move to Connecticut for a Ph.D program when I considered buying a new car. I didn't need a new car as my current one was reliable. However, in my circumstance, my parents would benefit more from having my car to fall back on in case of an emergency.

After researching and considering different used vehicles, I saw a used car (not a Fiat) for sale under $15,000 on the Holt Fiat website. I called the dealership and was able to meet with them later that Saturday afternoon.

This was my first time purchasing a car as my current one was purchased by my parents. I met Ryan and Paulin and told them that I wanted to finance the car on my own. After discussing the condition of the car, finances, and test driving the car, they offered me the same purchase price that I found on their website. Considering it was my first auto loan and that I have fair credit, they gave me a pretty decent offer that I was comfortable with.

I met with the finance guy afterwards and completed the paperwork within 10-15 minutes. Overall, from start to finish, the entire process took about 3 hours. It was pretty painless.

However, after I got home, I read through my contract and papers more closely and discovered an extended warranty that was added on. I didn't need nor want the coverage as the used car is a current model year (2014) and still covered by the original manufacturer's warranty.

I also needed to have the car shipped as I did not want to drive it across country. I asked about the possibility of them shipping the car for me. They said they would call me Monday to give me information.

Monday morning, around 9:30/10, I asked again about having my car shipped. I was informed I would receive a call back about it. By this point, I had informed several people that I needed the car shipped out of state that week as I was leaving Monday evening. I eventually found an auto transport company (Ship a Car Direct) on my own by 1 PM. The carrier was very prompt and professional. The company agreed to pick my car up at the dealership since my family and I would be out of town. Holt agreed to keep my car for me until the carrier arrived. 

After dropping off my car, I then began the process to remove the extended warranty. I was informed by the manager earlier that day, over the phone, that I could just walk in and they would take care of me. It was a very long wait and I was very pressed for time considering I was leaving for Connecticut that evening. They tried to convince me to keep the warranty. But, between the manufacturer's original warranty and my insurance, I was adequately covered already. 

When I finally met the only person they have working in the finance dept., it took approximately 5 minutes to make the change.

Overall, I felt very comfortable with the purchase of the car. It was a great deal and Paulin and Ryan were great to work with. However, the process after the sale of the car could have been more efficient. As a first time female car buyer, it was a good learning experience. The next time I purchase a car, I will be sure to pay better attention in the finance office.

I'm not sure if I would recommend them. It really depends on if they can meet your needs.

As for me, it was a pretty average experience considering some of the horror stories I've heard.",3.2

I drove out this morning.  Drove the truck and was pleased.  They offered me an acceptable amount for my trade-in.  I had my own financing already in place.  I thought I was done until they told me the price of the truck was $29,999.  I pulled up their website on my phone and showed the salesman the advertised price.  He came back, after another 20 minutes with the manager, with a price of $28,888.  That is when he informed me they have a $3,777 ""refurbishing"" fee on all used vehicles.

They were fine with letting us take the vehicle to a Honda shop for a purchase inspection (though every seller I’ve asked has been fine with that also) and the report indicated no major problems.  So that was nice.

There were a few miscommunications; however, their willingness to communicate via email and text while I was between meetings and deadlines at work, not to mention working a couple of states away, shows how above and beyond they wanted to go to provide a quality vehicle at a very good price.

I did not need GAP insurance as my new lender provides it free.  I asked for my GAP money  back and was told by the financing lady[Angie] who originally did the paperwork , that it would take 3 weeks.  I waited the three weeks and started calling and she would not return my phone calls. I called another person in financing and told him of my problem.  He told me he would look into it and get back with me.  That is a joke, no phone calls back.  I continued to call.

By this time I am quite upset , so, got off the phone and called the manager about 5 hours later.  It seems he knew nothing about this issue.  He did try to explain to me the process of getting your money back from GAP.  I kept telling him, "" you are not listening to me.""  I told him about my experience with Angie and that I was quite disappointed in this dealership and how it handles problems with customers.  I told him it did not seem like anyone at this dealership cared.  He said, "" I do.""

When I'm ready to purchase again or to trade my other vehicle in I will be doing it through Eddie Kraft.  I returned later on to have them look at the hood of my car and was treated like a returning friend, not just by Eddie but the salesman who helped my daughter and a guy in the service department.  I wish I remembered the service guy's name becaused he fixed my hood.  The fix was easy but thats not the point, he did it in a friendly and patient manner.  I",4.6
110,"December 04, 2011","My boyfriend and I came in looking for Melvin not knowing we were at the wrong place. When we arrived and asked for him no one seemed to know who we were looking for and not only made us feel stupid but very awkward too.we at this point almost left bit were so tired of searching for a car we decided to stay. We were then introduced to Eddie. And let's just say we were pretty annoyed with how he handled things. Or NOT handled things to be exact. He would go on these _rants and and get so off tracked that we know for a fact that if he stayed focused, our visit would or been 2hours rather than almost 5. We were informed by eddie to ask about a $500 gift card and when asked we were laughed at (literally ) and not even explained to about what it was for or even how to get it.  uan was nice buy we felt and caught him in a few lies. I know this is the car business but come on...atleast learn to stick to a story. We ended up buying and closing the deal with Jeff who was very professional and enjoyable. And dont me wrong...we are happy with our car . I just hope this rater helps you guys and maybe make more people happy and shows you some things that will make you better sales people. And maybe sell more cars on a Saturday. Also NEVER have I seen a dealership only put $20 in gas after purchasing.  .used or not a purchase is a purchase regardless kinda sad.",3.0
