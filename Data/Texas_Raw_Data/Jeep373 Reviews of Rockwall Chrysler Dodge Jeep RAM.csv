0,"March 10, 2020","My 2019 Ram had a defective passenger side fender, and since it was a warranty issue, Rockwall CDJR sent me to Rockwall Fords body shop to handle. When I walked in CDJR, I was not greeted and it seemed like nobody wanted to help. I finally asked if they were open(it was 5pm), and Meagan Stepped up to help. I told her about the issue, and she jumped right on it. She took pics, explained the process then sent the pics over, but never followed up with an answer from Ram. I called back a week later, still nothing. Finally after 2-1/2 to 3 weeks, the pics were approved. I got my truck in and they set me up with a rental. I only called once a week for an update, and sadly, I had to initiate most calls, and they couldn‚Äôt tell me much when we spoke. I finally got smart and called the body shop direct and that‚Äôs when I started working with Shelby. She started off strong, and I felt good about how things were going, but there were a couple of set backs, which I was more than understanding about, but during those set backs, she stopped calling me with updates. They finally got the fender replaced, and it looked great. They did forget to put the pinstripes back on the passenger door and fender, as well as the badges, which I pointed out immediately. I was told I could bring the truck back before 5 on any week day and they would take care of it. I went back the following day, and even called ahead, but all they could do is put the badges back on, due to the cold wet weather. Shelby told me she would give my info to their pinstripe guy and he would come to me and put the stripes on. Well, he didn‚Äôt call for 2+ weeks, so I called Shelby. She apologized and said she‚Äôd reach out to him. About 3-4 days later, he called. To this date, he has never called me back to schedule, so I just took them off of my entire truck. The part I‚Äôm most disappointed in is next. On my way home from the shop on Jan 20th, which was the first day I got it back, I stopped to fuel up. While I was fueling up, I was admiring the great work on the fender, but I noticed a scratch on my passenger mirror, and 2 very small gouges on my hood, right above the newly replaced fender. I immediately called Shelby to inform her, and she instantly said they didn‚Äôt do it and it was a rock chip, I politely disagreed and asked her to look into it the following day when I was going to be at the shop. When I was at the shop the following day, I pointed it out, and she continued saying it was a rock chip. I was very nice about it and told her whatever it was, it wasn‚Äôt there when I turned the truck over to Rockwall CDJR. She offered to get with Courtney, who took over with helping me, to see if he had pics. When I called to ask for an update, she said she hadn‚Äôt been able to speak with Courtney, but would keep trying. Another week passed and I hadn‚Äôt heard anything, so I called Courtney and got the pics myself. They were not broad enough pics, and only showed the defective fender, so I asked him if I could get the other pics, and who I needed to speak with, I never heard back from him. I called back later that week and spoke with JB(?), who was awesome, and he got with Meagan who had pics of my truck from the initial report, which clearly shows there was no damage when I turned the truck in. I called Shelby to inform her. She was very hesitant to offer to look at them. I obtained her email, emailed the pics, highlighting where the damage was and was not, and still haven't heard back from her, and that‚Äôs been 3+ weeks. I even emailed her again to ask if she had a chance to review... and haven't received a response. Sorry for the book, but this service was ridiculous! The gouges are very minor, and I could probably live with them, but this is now about the principle of the matter. I don‚Äôt know where to go if this essay falls on deaf ears, but I‚Äôm ready to do so if necessary. It‚Äôs comical how small these gouges are, and that I was in a rental from Dec 10 to Jan 20, but it‚Äôs also comical to know this is how you treat your customers. ",1.0

12,"February 13, 2020",Had a great experience with Michael my service advisor. I did not have the work completed by your dealership as I felt the overall price far exceeded the level of effort required for the job. I am giving you five stars on the price as it reflexes the zero dollar bill for diagnosing the issue. If I was to rate your estimate of 500.00 to replace a coolant expansion tank it would be two to three stars. ,5.0

23,"January 30, 2020","I live in Denton over 55 miles away from Rockwall, so it took a lot to get me to make the trip to purchase a new Ram Laramie Longhorn. It all started when I called Navy Federal Credit Union to get prequalified for a loan. After receiving credit approval they transferred the call to their preferred purchasing department. They explained as a member I would get the best deal using their preferred Dealer. They ask what brand and options I was looking for and they told me about Rockwall Ram.  Within a couple of hours I received a phone call from the dealer to make an appointment. When I arrived at the Dealership I was met by Kevin Round. He showed me several Ram 1500s with the equipment I wanted in my price range. I selected the one I wanted and the deal was made. I suggest all my fellow Veterans to use this service from Navy Federal Credit Union and Rockwall Ram. ",5.0

60,"October 26, 2019", I bought a 2014 Volkswagen Passat TDI and less than 40 hours of having it it blew a turbo hose and broke a turbo hose clamp.  Wow this was very irritating the car was in limp mode and I got it back to the dealer.  They quickly put me in a rental and upon being there I pointed out that all four tires were in my opinion below legal and very dry rotted.  They did fix my car as well as replace all four tires in as much of a timely manner as was possible due to the fact they were waiting on parts from Volkswagen.  Erica in-service is good at keeping communication overall I‚Äôm very happy with the experience this time things have definitely improved since my last purchase of the Chrysler town and country.  The only reason I gave four stars instead of five is due to the fact that I feel that both of the issues with the tires and the turbo should have been recognized upon inspection of the vehicle before sale.,4.2

It's now 1PM Tuesday and they still refuse to release my car.  

I am not even from Dallas, so now I am stranded here waiting:

1 - they indicated that once I have prove that the funds cleared, I can take the car - seems to be not the case

2 - they refuse to simply call accounting for a confirmation so we can all get on with our lives",2.0
82,"September 24, 2019","Don't believe any of their lies claiming to have integrity or caring about what's best for the customer because it's all a load of complete crap.  They'll blatantly lie to your face as much as they need to until you agree to something and then they'll pull the ole bait and switch and hope you don't notice it when you're signing the paperwork.  Then they'll claim ignorance and that you signed it so oh well nothing they can do about it now.

Thought I had a good experience with them only to find out they lied several times to my face on several different occasions and about several different things.  This dealership is why you're warned over and over again to read every detail as Rockwall Dodge tells you one thing but then the paper work is completely different.  Was lied to that I had to have the protection plan on a lease, which is conveniently buried in the numerous pages of the contract, but at least I have a 7 year warranty on a vehicle I was leasing.

144,"June 04, 2019",Do not go to this dealership if you want honest help and a honest process to buy and finance a car or truck.  We were in the store on 6/3.  We looked at the used car we set an appointment for. We agreed to buy the car.  No haggle priced.  My son and I stated we had done the research on the trade and were offered an extremely low offer on his car.  We declined. Upon coming back to us again I ask that we get out price we wanted or there was no deal.  Then once more they came back in again and offering a little higher offer.  So we decided to go.  They promptly gave us the requested price.  Then off to finacing.  This was much less than professional.  We obviously know how to use a calculator to figure automotive lending calculations.   We were told we would not qualify for the payment we requested as the credit was not sufficient to do so with absolutely perfect credit and co-signing for my 18 yr old son also perfect credit.   We went to another dealer and were told there is absolutely no problem getting what we need and all is good.  We bought another car from another dealer.  However after we stated we would use our own bank the dealer proceeds to send my sons application to 9 banks and did not send my wife‚Äôs application to knowone.  We specifically ask that they send both applications to one back to prevent multipal inquiries.  This did not happen.  We know now that the finance office did not want to obtain financing the deal as they would not make a profit in that office because we may have been looking at a calculator.  So we were told it could not be done and we promptly left.  We ask for a buyers order so we could use our own bank.  They still sent the application out to banks after they said it would not get done.  ??    This is not the only bad experience with this store as one will see in other reviews.   As if selling the car is not enough the store had to make additional money for you to buy from them.  They do not want an educated customer there.  Be careful with what you hear from them.  Very bad experience.  ,1.0

156,"April 28, 2019","The sales person and finance manager, were very knowledgeable, courteous, polite and experienced.  
The sale of the car was disappointing, I previously bought two cars from this dealership, that did not go very far because I did not get any discount on the price of the used car.  Also I did not want the fabric guard and after negotiating cost down to $100 above dealers cost I agreed to it. However I called the manufacturer and they told me that it did not cover vehicles four years or older, furthermore I cannot cancel the fabric guard. So the paint chips or fabric tears are not covered on the 2015 Challenger I bought, they said the only thing they would cover would be just to clean the fabric.  So I was mislead in the sales of the fabric guard. 
After the sale of the car, I found out the a/c compressor was bad, that was disappointing but the sales person assured me that it would be fixed and it was, the service department fixed it and had the car a day later. 
So, would I recommend this dealership to someone else, No, will I purchase another vehicle from this dealership, NO never again. 
I had a better experience with the first two cars I bought from this dealership, although I like the 2015 Challenger I purchased very much, I have to be honest and say I was disappointed with the sale of the car, a discounted price and no fabric option would have made the purchase a whole lot better.

He found exactly the truck I was looking for making the experience of choosing and purchasing a new truck something I enjoyed.  My past experience with buying a new vehicle had NOT been a pleasant experience, but purchasing a truck from Rockwall Ram has been painless and quick ... just the way it is suppose to be. 

This is the second dealership that I had been to trying to purchase a truck. The other dealership would not listen to my needs nor answer my questions about incentives.",5.0

I made an appointment with Colin Lilly and was very impressed with Colin's knowledge of the RAM 1500 I was interested in.  Colin answered all of my questions and provided me information on the vehicle I wasn't aware of which was extremely helpful.  Very nice buying experience.,5.0

199,"January 03, 2019"," I think they are as useless as a $3.00 bill . My car needed serviced for the navigational system and being new to the area I relied on it a lot. So after going the steps that it said to and calling Garmin and Chrysler we went online and researched the problem. Found out that this was an issue with this particular radio and most of the time needed replaced (which is over $1,400.00). We also read that the warranty for the radio was extended so again I called Chrysler to verify and they said yes. After Thanksgiving I went to Rockwall Dodge and had them pull up the information on my car to verify it with them. Said I would schedule to bring it in while I was in Delaware for Christmas. I dropped it off before we left it was on the schedule for Wednesday after Christmas. They call and say it's the radio and needs to be replaced and it's not covered under warranty. I asked why not and was told because of the mileage. I said I have a 10 year unlimited mile warranty for the radio. Marc told me Chrysler doesn't have that warranty which I responded I know it does because I saw it on the computer just a few weeks before. He THEN pulled up my information and said oh it does say that and that he would check into and call me RIGHT back. That was early Wednesday. He didn't call me back that day, Thursday I called and was put through to his voice mail every time. I called back one last time and complained that Marc has not called me back and was told someone would call me RIGHT back. Never called. Friday I called and explained and they said Marc would call me. He finally did explained that he was out Thursday but did find out my radio was covered under warranty but would be next week before the new one came in. Great finally. Yesterday morning I get a call from them but no message so I immediately call them back get put through to Marc's voice mail and wait. Over 2 hours go by and I call my husband and have him call because I was really fed up at this point this was at noon. He calls and is told that our service writer JOSE is with a customer and will call him back. At 2 my husband calls back and talks to Larry and explains we are just trying to figure out what's going on because Marc hasn't returned my call yet. Larry informs my husband that JOSE hasn't worked there in weeks. Which my husband than asks what was this girl talking about because he was standing there talking to clients. Are you seeing the problems yet? So Larry now tells my husband he will look into it call him RIGHT back. Larry calls him and says the radio came in that morning and should be installed today or tomorrow but would have Marc call. Now Marc has still not called be back from the morning but calls my husband and talks to him. This morning I thought we had an emergency with our dog and called my husband home from work. So that it wasn't a wasted trip home we called to check on my car. Guess what Derrick said he would look into it and call us RIGHT back. We waited for an hour and half for him to go talk to the technician and call us back. I called and asked for the service manager because I was done dealing with ‚Ä¶.. I unleashed on him I asked for his corporate service representative and was told he didn't have that information which I know isn't true because this isn't my first rodeo with dealerships. I was told my car was ready which I said I would be right there. All I wanted was to walk in get my car and go and be done with them. Marc however thought he needed to come out and explain to me what happened as if I didn't know. That's when he made the comment and to keep from making a seen and probably having to cops called I walked away. Now I hope those who think I might be over reacting understand why I feel the way I do and have said the things I have said.",1.4

230,"October 22, 2018","Some time ago, my wife and I came in to look at several used trucks. The sales team all but neglected us - it took almost two hours to see one truck. We left very unsatisfied and vowed not to return. We ended up buying a truck somewhere else. 

However, my new (new to me) truck had several recalls that needed to be completed and well, we live in Rockwall. I ended up scheduling an appointment with Derek. Derek is a true professional and does a great job scheduling appointments. He warned me that he may not be able to complete all recalls but that he would do everything he could to get the parts in time. I received a phone call during the maintenance to let me know the progress (this is good) and the shuttle driver (I forget his name) was timely, a very safe driver, and was good to talk to. As a bonus, it turns out that all recalls were able to be completed. 

So, I likely won't return to Rockwall CDJR for vehicle purchases but I will return for service.

Although it would be great to consider what I call ‚Äúfollow through‚Äù and service automation. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I did receive a call and other emails to conduct surveys as to how the service was conducted. Follow through ‚Äî would be to consider having a service adviser explain in detail what service was conducted especially if the original service adviser is not present. Explaining  the vehicle owner the work   conducted in detail goes a long way. In this case I had to do the research myself what was done. 
Service automation would be emailing the customer emails or texts on the status of the vehicle and upon completion, pick up and signature   send service and statement via email or text. This would also go under the ‚ÄúFollow Through‚Äù 

Consider adding  a service category of ‚ÄúFollow Through‚Äù

They are always professional and friendly when dealing with them directly. I have given a 4 out of 5 star rating for an overall rating due to the small little details that seem to be overlooked before notifying a customer his/her vehicle is ready. 

example:
Making sure that the customers vehicle is washed and looking better than it was recieved. This may not seem like much, but if it is part of the service/repair of a customers vehicle then dealership personel need to make sure its 100% ready to give back to the customer ""before"" notifying them it is ready. These small little details will always keep a 5 out of 5 star rating from being given.
