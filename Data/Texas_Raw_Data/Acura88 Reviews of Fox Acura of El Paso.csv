1,"January 08, 2020","I have tried to get the service manager at Acura of El Paso to take care of a 2016 recall of my 2010 Acura TSX and she (Jessica) was not helpful at all and insists that I call client relations (national number) but I cannot speak to a person, only computers.  I am frustrated to no end and I feel that the local Acura store is giving the run around thus I do not recommend anyone to deal with this Acura dealership due to the rudeness and non-helpful service manager (Jessica)

6,"May 14, 2019","I was hesitate to write a review, I have been going to Fox Acura for some time and these past few months its been a dread going. The customer service from the staff is great but I'm guessing this particular person is a manager. He sit's in a office towards the front entrance.  The last time I was there I over heard someone call his name and I picked up Scott. This man face expressions are the worst. I'm not sure if that is his day to day face or is he really that mean. I could over hear how he would speak to his employees and all I can say if I was the owner, this man wouldn't be working for me. You can tell the staff walks on egg shells and its kind of embarrassing when I only feel comfortable going with my husband. You can definitely feel the energy that it is not what it once was. I highly recommend Fox Acura but I really wished the energy was more positive and inviting like it was in the past. ",3.8

77,"October 18, 2016","I've had problems with my vehicle since I purchased it. Nothing major but for some reason I have to provide my own customer service. Today has been a bad day but I took it in stride. I stopped by the service department because it takes forever for someone to answer the phone. 
The young lady said she was busy but I could have my car towed and she would call me upon its arrival and if they could get to it today or tomorrow she would call me. I've called six times. Three times no answer. Left a message no return call. Finally got a live body to confirm receipt of my vehicle. Then almost four hours later still no response.  

If you pay $40K -$50K for a car the least the service department can do is call you back.

83,"February 11, 2016","I had bought my first Acura in 2010 from Hoy Fox Acura and had always taken my vehicle to get serviced there and always had good customer service.  I had always said that I would purchase my next Acura out of town, for more options and better deals.  But it wasn‚Äôt until 2015 when I took my 2010 TSX in for a regular service and I received A+++excellent customer service from the new Service manager, Julian Reyes. Because of Mr. Reyes‚Äôs excellent customer service I decided to just look at Hoy Fox‚Äôs inventory. I met Claudia, who went out of her way to meet my needs with also her excellent customer service. I ended up purchased another Acura from Hoy Fox Acura and kept my business here locally. I definitely will continue to take now both vehicles to get service here. I am a loyal customer to Hoy Fox Acura service department!! Thank you for your A+++ customer service!! ",5.0
84,"January 25, 2016","I purchased two Acura vehicles from this dealership and have dealt with their sub-standard service many times already. Each time I was unhappy about something, so my review here is not only based on my latest negative experience. However, this last time their service and their way of treating me as a loyal customer was unprecedented, so I decided to write here. In short, their service department is very unprofessional, straight out rude with costumers, and at the same time double or even more expensive than other car services in the area. The sales department also has its set of issues and low capability of working fairly with costumers, but of course, they at least try as they want you to buy an Acura. However, once you bought it, in my case two times, there is no respect for the costumer. I would not recommend for anyone to deal with Hoy Fox Acura in any fashion and I'm certainly never going to step foot on their dealership again. If I ever buy another Acura, I go to the nearest city to do so.",1.2
85,"May 06, 2014","I brought my 2012 TSX in for service which I purchased in Colorado. Jessica was the service adviser and she wasn't friendly at all. Very rude and abrupt and made me feel like I was bothering them.I had an appointment for an oil change and to have two issues looked at (engine pinging and engine vibration) and she immediately dismissed those and told me they were normal. I asked if she could have the technicians look at it anyway and she seemed annoyed. When my car was ready, there was no mentioning of my issues on the bill. They ""washed"" my car but it looked worse than when I brought it in. The customer lounge was dirty, dark and cramped. Sales associates kept coming to me trying to get my info. I wasn't relaxed at all. I came back a few weeks later as I was annoyed the engine pinging was still present and I was afraid it would harm my motor. I again, delt with Jessica (I think there are only two service advisers here) and she basically interrupted me in mid-sentence and told me that there was nothing they could do and it was a characteristic of the car. A few weeks later, i took my car 300 miles away to another Acura dealer in Albuquerque, NM and they fixed the problem with a software update free of charge and no hassle. I will never go back to Hoy Fox Acura.  ",1.4
86,"October 17, 2012","Jessica the service advisor thinks she owns the place, she is not friendly at all. I wish acura would hire based on qualifications and not looks, they have lost me as a customer because of the self absorbed service advisor named jessica. If you are planning to take your vehicle to hoy fox acura service, be prepared to kiss her butt since that is what she expects. Honey, you don't own acura! Get over yourself and focus on customer service for once.....sad day for acura when you got hired.",2.0
87,"August 19, 2009","Communication and understanding on their part was unsatisfactory when it came to the inconvenience of fixing my car.  They may have not been at fault for wrecking my car, but just the same they were the ones driving it.  They also should have allowed me to choose where I wanted to take my vehicle to be fixed.  I had given no authorization to anyone to have my car fixed at their body shop.",2.2
