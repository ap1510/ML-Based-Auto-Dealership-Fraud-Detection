1,"May 17, 2020","I was told by ""Acia"" (over the phone) that I could get the online price (~$44K ($14,850 in discounts/cash)) PLUS 0% financing through Nissan. She had no idea what she was talking - I only found that out once I started working with Heather.  Heather then told me I could get the 0% financing through Nissan, but I wasn't eligible for the Nissan Cash (now the price is ~$49K).  When I went to sign my paperwork for my new vehicle, the finance guy (can't remember his name) told I could get the 0% financing through Nissan, but the not all the discounts Heather told me I could get.  NOW the price of the truck is well over $50K.  In the short span of an hour, the truck I wanted went from $44K to over $50K.  Talk about a bait and switch.  So, I'm still at the dealership and faced with a decision; do I take the high-priced bait and switch offer to get 0% from Nissan, or do I get my own loan though my bank to get the original $44K online offer?  While I'm crunching the numbers and determining the benefit of 0% (with a higher priced truck) or a substantially lower priced truck (with a loan from my bank), the General Manager (GM) decides to run my credit (hard credit pull).  I called my bank (not knowing what the General Manager was doing) and spoke with them about my loan application - I negotiated a MUCH better rate (2.69%) than when I checked the rates earlier in the morning.  After the GM pulled my credit, I'm brought a piece of paper with other bank offers - none of them came close to my bank.  I rejected the other bank offers and then...  The senior finance guy comes out (I don't remember his name).  He tries to tell me that I'd ""really being helping out World Car Nissan and other customers"" if I took one of their preferred banks' offers.  I explained to the finance guy how three different people told me three different prices for the exact same truck and then told him I was not interested in helping out the dealership that deals the way they do.  During this whole process, I spoke with the GM (Leon Reid) three times.  Each time, he heard what I was saying, but I could see he wasn't listening (he was already preparing what he wanted to say while I was speaking).  Each time, he never addressed the issue - his people are completely untrained and don't know how the rebates/discounts work.  His response each time was how he was basically doing me a favor by speaking with me (while trying to be my pal and telling me how he's ""down in the trenches with all the sales people"").  I was completely underwhelmed with him and his staff.  Bottom Line:  Don't trust what is on their website, or what you are told by anyone there.  Get EVERYTHING in writing from EVERYONE and hold them accountable.",1.8

4,"June 01, 2019","Andy Tisei, a salesman@ World Car Nissan Hyundai, is a person to ask for by name!!! He's soooo patient and NEVER pressures you. He asks what you need, what you can afford and he finds the right car. I recently bought a used car on Memorial Day and Andy spent 7 hours plus with me making sure I was in the right car at the right price!!! I love this guy and I love World Car Nissan!!!",5.0
5,"April 08, 2019","The first sales person was very helpful and nice. She was super understanding and seemed genuinely interested in what I had to say. We test drove a car, and although the car interior was extremely dirty it drove very nicely. She then turned us to her manager/ financial person. He was extremely pushy and rude! I went in wanting to test drive a Sentra waited for 4 hrs to test drive 1 car. Not a Sentra! When asked if I was ready to purchase, I answered not yet I’m gonna test drive a Sentra with Gun dealership. His reply was well how much are they offering their car. I replied $8,400 with 94,000 miles, keep in mind your Sentra was $8,700 with 106,000. He replied with a Snarky comment about it only being a couple miles more and was still pushing the (dirty) sonata, not even offering the Sentra!!! I ended up purchasing the vehicle from Gun. Thanks ",1.0
6,"November 03, 2018","Last Saturday, I purchased a 2017 Nissan Rogue from the Hyundai Used Car dealership (World Car Nissan Hyundai North in San Antonio, TX). It had 8163 miles on it and 1 owner. The sales rep, Akeem Mercer, did a perfectly fine job and the process itself is not necessarily the issue, although I walked in with an approval of 3.79% and they assured me they could match that interest rate. When I got to the finance side of the house, the interest rate jumped to 3.94%. I could have sat there another hour or 2 to get my percentage rate but I was willing to overlook the ""mistake"".

My issue has to do with the service after the sale. When I had the car delivered and the keys handed over to me (Intelligent keys), I realized there was only 1 set. Recognizing that should the battery die or we lose this set, my wife could be stranded with no way to get the car going, I immediately reached out to the rep via text who stated he would look for a 2nd set. He later replied that there was no other set and he could ""order one for me for a couple hundred"". I was shocked at this point. Why was this becoming my problem? I then looked in the glove box for what to do if we did have a non-functional set of keys and there was no Owners Manual.

The following Monday, I got an email from the store Sale Manager:

""As a manager here at World Car Hyundai North I wanted to make sure your expectations have been met.   Has my team answered all of your questions? Is there anything you are still looking for?
 
Please let me know. I am here if you need anything.

John Virkus
World Car Hyundai
mobile:XXX-XXX-XXXX
Sales Manager""


I responded with all of the issues I stated above, expecting to get resolution for my problems. I did not hear back from him that day so sent a 2nd email asking if he really wanted to know about my experience - he responded he truly did so I resent my original message. I still did not hear back from him so I called him Wednesday morning to inquire as to what he was going to do and he said he would call back. He did call a few hours later and said he had a Manual for me but could not get me a 2nd set of keys. He stated it was not unusual for a used car not to have a second key for the vehicle and my only resolution would be to buy it.

At this point, I was beside myself because this was NOT my issue. The fact that they did not get the 2nd key from the original owner was and should not be my problem and they should replace it at no cost. I went on to explain that had this been brought up during the negotiation of the sale, I would have either asked them to drop the price to the amount i would have to buy the 2nd set for or I would not have signed the ""As Is"" paperwork. In other words, I was never given a chance to know that this 2nd key was missing so how could I have been able to negotiate properly. I feel as if I have been misled by not having this conversation. Not to mention that when I buy that 2nd set of keys, I am paying MSRP whereas they could most likely get it at cost which would be significantly less.

Earlier today (Friday) I went to the dealership to get the book but the one they had for me was for a Rogue Sport. I told them I had a Rogue and not a Sport that same manager came out and said it was the same book and that depending on when it 2017 it was, they had gone to an ""online version of the Owners Manual"". I told him I wanted the correct one and we once again went down the replacement key path. After he tried to explain again about the key and I restated my point, I went to the Nissan dealership in an effort to get an Owners Manual myself and to ask if it was true about the ""online version"". It was not true so now he had lied in an effort to get me ""resolved"". I then took up the issue of the key. Long story short, the local Nissan sales rep tried to help, going back and forth with his management and finally informed me the GM from the Hyundai shop was coming over to discuss this with me. Who did it turn out to be? The same Sales Manager. We went thru everything again and he finally said ""I will get you a replacement manual but I WILL NOT get you a second key"" - just as adamant as it is written.

This dealership is only concerned with the immediate sale with no care of the service after the sale. Once they had my money, they were no longer interested in my situation that they had technically created. Had I known that this was going to occur, I promise you I would have walked out of the store because I would have known then that this was how they treat their customers.

I will make sure none of my friends go to this location. I will be putting this on my Facebook in a public post so everyone that reads it is aware of their lack of integrity and the desire to do the right and morally correct thing. I will also post this at my Twitter, Yelp and the stores Facebook account. This is now about the principle of how a vendor treats its customers after the sale is done. The reality is we are talking about less than $100 at their cost. Even if I DO have to pay for a 2nd key, I promise not to purchase from World Car Nissan Hyundai North.",1.0

8,"September 21, 2018",Did initial research online and had a fair idea what I was looking for. I went in and briefed the sales agent who took my input and quickly honed in on the vehicle I had in mind.

9,"September 17, 2018","My salesman was very patient with us. Very helpful, had everyone that could help, help us.

12,"March 12, 2018",I went in looking for a specific Frontier and Laura Ann was able to find it for me and she helped me out with everything and gave me details about the truck and changed my mind on getting a Tacoma. Definitely a great deal and amazing customer service. Thanks Laura! ,5.0
13,"February 24, 2018","After 5 days of trying to buy their 2014 Acura TL and getting no call backs, no intelligent responses, no basic information other than it is in stock, I gave up.  I have been in sales all my life and I have never seen such incompetent, uncaring conduct towards customers or their job, and I have seen a lot.  

DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME! 

Also check their service department's ratings, they are also HORRIBLE !",1.0
14,"December 27, 2017","I was considering 3 different vehicles from 3 different dealerships.  Scott Hutchinson, at World Car Hyundai North, took the time to really listen when I explained what elements were important to me in a vehicle.  He searched inventory, followed up, had a test drive ready for when I arrived at the dealership.  He was the best at the follow up and follow through.  While other dealerships follow up with canned emails, Scott sent personal emails and texts in relation to following up and asking questions - he was responsive - friendly - extremely helpful.  Very pleased with the overall experience.",5.0

18,"December 17, 2017",Salesman was good it was the finance dept where I was taken advantage of and I gave 5000 down hoping to get payment lower and that was not the case . I need some clarification of this. It took a long time for sale but finance was rushed an,3.2
19,"December 16, 2017","We had a great experience with World Car Hyundai when having to replace a 2015 Santa Fe due to an accident. Our sales person, Bill Stratton asked what we wanted and researched inventory before we arrived to look at vehicles.  He saved us a great deal of time looking because he understood what we were looking for.  We purchased a new vehicle in record time because of his due diligence. Finance officer Derrick Trussell explained everything very well and did not try to sell us something we did not want. Overall we were very pleased with the purchase of our new Santa Fe.",4.8

29,"December 05, 2017",I was very pleased with Rachel Rubio. She was very polite and informative. She never tried to hurry me or push me into a sale. Almost every other salesman for other makes tried to lie or harrassed me into buying a vehicle from them. That is the reason I bought from Hyundai.,5.0
30,"December 01, 2017",My experiences a World Car Hyundai are always exceptional and this time was no different. Billy Stratton is and will be my go to sales person. His professionalism and pleasant personality are beyond reproach. He follows up on everything and is always quick to find solutions to our problems when they arise. Hats off to World Car Hyundai.,5.0
31,"November 24, 2017","Called to World Car Hyundai North to make sure the two Santa Fes listed had the Tech Package and Jolissa went over the vehicle sticker and confirmed that both Ultimate’s 2.0T included the Tech Package. Went to the dealership and learned that Jolissa could not sell the car because she is an online coordinator and not a salesperson. But one of the managers was quick to retrieve the keys according to the VIN numbers she provided. Fred became my salesperson. We went through the paperwork and the 1st RED FLAG was when he offered the protection package (paint and leather sealing). According to Fred the paint sealer lasts 4 years, actually the best sealer on the market only lasts 1 reason why even this seal requires to reapply every year.  2nd RED FLAG, Fred offered to give me an additional $500 discount going with their financial company vs. Randolph Brooks Federal Credit Union (RBFCU) and told me that it was all the same. I then asked to show me the interest rate to compare…surprise, surprise, nice deception attempt. Fred’s offer was for a 4% vs. RBFCU’s 1.9%. He then removed the $500 discount offer. So make sure you see the details of EVERYTHING. We went to eat while they were making the “car ready” and paperwork ready. Wanted to make sure that somewhere in the warranty paperwork there was mention of the turbo engine been covered as part of the powertrain lifetime warranty and it took a while, but they were able to find the info and show us.  3rd RED FLAG, Asked about transferring my Disabled Veteran plates but was told that I had to do that myself since I was not turning in the other vehicle as trade-in. Called the Tax Office to check how to transfer the plate and was told that the dealer should have done it for me because not it was going to cost me more and it was going to be 3 transactions vs. the 1.  4th RED FLAG, Next day I was going over setting all remotes and instructions and noticed that items included in the Tech Package were missing. The dealership keeps records of all messages with customers and they know that Jolissa mentioned to me that the vehicle had the Tech Package. So Fred offered to take the vehicle back.  5th RED FLAG, The vehicle was handed over on the first day with filthy windows, protective tape still installed. The “get ready” was just removing the seat plastic covers and maybe rinsing the outside of the vehicle. Reason why there were dirty footprints on the back doors ledge where someone stepped on to reach the top of the car when drying. Didn’t pay for the extra protection so I got a lousy vehicle “get ready” job. 6th RED FLAG, Fred called me to bring the paperwork and have the DV plates issue resolved. I also mentioned and showed him the issued w/ “get ready” job. He told me that he was going to do it right since I decided to keep the car. This place CAN’T keep commitments or promises. Half an hour later Fred tells me the vehicle is ready. Fred removed the two protective tapes I showed him and that was it. Got back to work and decided to take a quick look. ALL other tapes are still installed, the dirty footprint is still in the same spot. The panoramic roof had round water marks from objects that were placed on it and not cleaned.    He did nothing to the vehicle. A week later, I keep finding items covered in plastic.  Believe I made a terrible mistake.",1.6

35,"November 17, 2017","The treatment throughout this whole process by Rachel & Jack are why I am happy I went with World Car. Any deductions in this review were made because of Kevin's behavior and although they do not reflect the behavior of everyone, the service department is one of the key elements in our decision making and it was not until I spoke with Kevin that I started questioning or doubting my purchase. Rachel is a 5 star employee and I am recommending her to everyone!!!",4.6
36,"November 15, 2017",Overall I am happy with my experience at WCH.  I went to another Hyundai dealer in my town and was unhappy with the back and forth on the price.  I left and went to WCH and immediately the Sales Person was able to understand what I was trying to achieve and got me to where I wanted in payment.  It was not the back and forth that I experienced at the other dealership.  For me this meant everything in purchasing from this dealer.  The Salesman was to the point and wanted to make the deal and get me out as bad as I wanted the same thing.  I hate spending hours and hours at a dealership;  overall we were able to come to a deal in a short time.,5.0

41,"October 29, 2017","The staff is very friendly and Just like every dealer, be prepared to spend 3-5hrs to get through financing. I truly believe the Worldcar auto group should make the Hyundai dealership and showroom as nice and welcoming as they did their Nissan dealership next door. Not only is navigating the tiny parking lot dangerous, the Hyundai showroom is dark, drab, and not very welcoming. Think of a cheap, cheesy roadside motel lobby.  Right next door. though, the Worldcar Nissan dealership is open and bright, much like the lobby of a grand hotel. At the Worldcar Nissan dealership they have coffee, snacks, free soft drinks, and more comfortable seating. At Worldcar Hyundai, it seems like they to an auction house and got the cheapest furniture they could find.   So, what is Worldcar trying to say about their brands? My first impression was Worldcar Nissan is the priority, it's far more important than Worldcar Hyundai. I went to Worldcar Hyundai because it's an excellent dealership. I bought a Hyundai because of the superb vehicle quality and outstanding value. i have owned a Nissan Altima and a Hyundai Sonata. I truly prefer the Sonata over the Altima. When it came time to by my daughter a new car, I bought her a Hyundai Elantra.    Other than brand prioritizing, nothing else can explain why the Worldcar auto group is presenting their Nissan and Hyundai dealerships so differently. It's unfortunate they do though, The difference makes me wonder how many sales Hyundai has lost because of the squalled appearance Worldcar has given the Hyundai dealership as opposed the more inviting Worldcar Nissan Dealership?",5.0

The caveat, if shopping at this dealership, is that the buyer should be diligent and not take the salesperson at their word, especially if he/she doesn't seem knowledgeable about the product.

Fred Colunga in sales knew which end was up and got right to the point and did not try to dazzle us with hyperbole.  He found the car we wanted and was quite clear in explaining it all to us.

66,"August 30, 2017","I've been a salesman and more often a sales manager directing sales teams of 20-40 individuals. The basics obviously, if you do not know the answer to a customer's question---DO NOT MAKE UP AN ANSWER!  I do not remember the salesman's name. I guess I was just a number to him as he told me so. The car was a 2016 Genesis, and the salesman knew he would get little or no commission, so he gave me the attitude appropriate to his selfish situation. I was shown how to lock and unlock the car, start the car, and he pointed at the navigation system and told me to read the manual. Everyone knows the manuals are written by Koreans. Broken English in every manual. I know as I read.",3.2

He informed me of features that I do not have---- my original salesperson would not have done that.  My tank was not on full--the line before full. My paper license plate began to fall off 3 days later---not securely on.  I had to make a special trip back to have it put back on properly.

80,"August 11, 2017","While we would recommend our salesperson (Kevin) again, we am no longer certain that we would recommend the dealership.  Which is a change from the experience we had in 2011 when we purchased our first Hyundai Sonata from your dealership.  The salesperson listened to what we did and did not want to do.  However, the backoffice seems to be antiquated and needs to focus on what the customer says they want.  An informed customer does not want or need the to follow the ""checklist"" approach that is used with most people.  We also felt as though we were treated with bias (profiled) by the backoffice during this transaction.  We could try to explain it, however this is not something tangible that you will be able to pinpoint.  If you really are concerned about equal treatment of your customers, you should make some changes in management and educate your employees.  Also, no one wants to deal with a manager who is not genuine (to put it nicely), so him stepping in to ""save the day"" was ridiculously orchestrated and we would have preferred to just have the salesperson deliver the good news.  Once someone builds a rapport with you, you don't disrupt things by adding a stranger.",1.0

108,"June 24, 2017","Here is what happened to me during my purchase of a 2017 Hyundai Sonata at World Car Hyundai in San Antonio, TX. After reading this you should understand why I scored the survey as I did.  On Saturday June 10th my wife and I visited the dealership looking for a 2017 Hyundai Sonata Limited. The sales person greeted us and showed us what was available on the lot. I had gone through Truecar and this is what led me to this dealership. There weren’t a lot of choices available on the Limited model in San Antonio. We found the 2017 Hyundai Sonata Limited 2.0 Turbo and test drove it. We liked the vehicle very much and decided to go forward with the purchase. During the negotiations the dealership presented a price and ultimately we decided on a price $500 less. Everything was set. I was going to pay cash but was told I could save more money if I financed with Hyundai so I did. From the time we agree on a price to the time I actually got the vehicle took approximately 4 hours. Seemed like forever. The financing when through just fine. We scheduled an appointment to have the appearance package added to the vehicle the next week. We drove the vehicle home and thought everything was good.   Three days later I get a call from the finance guy saying I added the wrong vehicle to my insurance. The VIN on the vehicle from the ID card they have does not match what they sold me. I verified that the VIN on the ID card is indeed the vehicle they sold me. Then the finance guy realized they screwed up and did the whole deal on the wrong vehicle. He said I would need to sign all new paperwork. I agree to meet him at a Starbucks halfway between my house and the dealership and sign the correct paperwork. I met him and while I was going through the new paperwork when I can to the document with the total purchase price I noticed the price had increased by $2600. He did NOT tell me this, I’m the one that pointed it out. I said we have a problem. This is not the price we negotiated. He said he understood but the price we negotiated was on a different vehicle. I said that was not my fault. I test drove the vehicle I wanted. And in good faith negotiated the price on that vehicle. He said I would have to drive back to the dealership and speak to the sales manager.   I drove all the way back to the dealership. Spoke with the sales manager and he said the only thing they can do is reduce the price by $500. I said that was unacceptable. They should give me the price we negotiated. It was not my fault that they used pricing on a different vehicle. He accused me of wanting free money. I requested to speak with the General Manager. Gave him my story and he agree to give me $1200 off but not the full $2600 price increase. This whole time neither the Sales Manager or General Manager EVER ONCE apologized to me for what was happening. The salesman we had (Andy Bailey) did apologize but he was the only one. I was in a dilemma. On one hand I wanted to scrape the whole deal and get my trade-in back. But we had the new vehicle for 3 days and I had no idea what had happened to my trade-in. Plus we had been looking for a new vehicle for awhile and had gone to a few dealerships and was so ready for the process to be over.   All said and done, they agree to reduce the total to $1500, but not the full $2600. I agree because I just wanted it to be over. I still feel this was wrong. I believe that World Car should have stood on THEIR mistake and compensated me financially as well as ALL the time it took doing this. They were completely unprofessional (again not Andy Bailey the salesman).   So the next week I take the vehicle in for the appearance package (on a Friday). Was told I would get it back the same day. I got it late the next day and there were scratches on the driver and passenger side window tents which the service guy pointed out to me. So  we set up ANOTHER appointment. I went back the next week and got the windows redone.   All told, I have been to World Car Hyundai 5 times in two weeks. I live 20 miles away.   This is why I scored the survey as I did.

124,"June 02, 2017","If I could give ""0"" stars, I would. I learned the hard way that these criminals cannot be trusted. I received their ""Money Carlo"" promotion by mail on 05/30/2017, which stated that I had won a $5,000 prize. I called the dealership, advised them that I had no interest in purchasing a vehicle but wanted to confirm that I had, in fact, won the $5,000 prize--that I did not want to waste a trip to the dealership if I had not won the prize. The representative advised that ""yes"", I had won the prize but that she would need to schedule an appointment for me. She further advised that they would ""probably cut [me] a check"" when I present for the appointment. On 06/01/2017 I drove to World Car Nissan (I do not live close to the dealership) where I was advised that I had not, in fact, won the $5,000 prize but instead had won an opportunity to play a scratch-off game ticket. I left with only a $5 Walmart Gift Card. Furious, I called the dealership back upon returning home and requested to speak with a sales manager. I was advised by a customer service representative that a sales manager was unavailable but would call me back. I expressed my concerns about the promotion to the representative and advised him that the fine print on the promotion is highly misleading and may constitute deceptive trade practice under both federal and state law. He responded, ""I agree with you, sir. I'm on your side. It is a little bit of deception; we have to get peoples' attention."" He further added that the staff ""probably needed to be trained a little bit more, so everyone's on the same page"" and that ""several other people have called up here upset about this promotion."" I received no return call from a sales manager but instead was forced to file complaints with the Texas Attorney General's office and with the Federal Trade Commission. I am currently seeking an attorney to represent me with this claim. On 06/02/2017 I called the dealership back and requested to speak with a sales manager. Initially, I spoke to sales manager Jason, who began arguing with me when I voiced my concerns about the promotion, stated ""this call is now over"", and hung up the phone on me. I called back and was then transferred to sales manager Ralph, who also began arguing with me. I advised Ralph that I would be seeing the dealership in court. Do NOT trust these people. They are blatant liars and even admit that they engage in deception ""to get peoples' attention.""",1.0

172,"February 25, 2017","My Fiancé and I found a great vehicle for our family. Decided to take a test drive and start our paperwork and vehicle appraisal. While waiting for the appraisal, which they said would take about 40 minutes, we decided to run an errand, our sales person was well aware of. When we came back to the dealer after about 45 minutes the minute we walked through the door they wanted to know what we still owed on our trade in. To us that was irrelevant because we already had our finance preapproved through our own lender. That's when everything went south. The sales person cut off my fiancé in mid sentence and stormed off to tell one of the finance guys ""they don't want to give us the numbers"". My fiancé then walked right up to the sales person and told her it was very unprofessional what she had done and said she was no longer going to help us and to get someone else that will. Once that sales person came over, they were and continued to be honest and nice through the rest of the experience. At this point, a sales manger then comes over and tell us that someone else has purchased the vehicle in cash. Didn't even drive the vehicle. As we are actively working a deal, some one else jumps in and steals the car??? Talk about quantity and not quality from a dealer! After a bit of back and forth whit this sales manager, the general manager comes out and lets me know that this is normal practice in his dealership and that's how he runs it. That it wasn't the 1st time and most likely won't be the last time. My jaw dropped. I was almost at a loss for words when I'm usually not. I explained that any dealer I've been to in the past had never sold a car our from under us like that. Guess there's always a 1st.

So on our way home tonight, well after the dealer had already close (10:30 CST), we decided to drive by the dealer and guess what? The vehicle is still there, in the same spot, same position that we left it in after the test drive! Yea, someone paid cash and decided not to take the vehicle home that night. A possibility but that's all suspect to me.

Buyer beware at this dealership. They reel you in with their complementary soft drinks, cookies, etc but its all a sharade. They are the epitome of a dealer not a place that wants to establish a relationship with their customers.",2.2
173,"February 21, 2017",Andrew was a great salesman. Andrew listen to me and got me into a car that I liked and afford. I have my car for now a month and I still call with help and is always willing to help me.,5.0
174,"February 19, 2017","I have purchased quite a few new vehicles.  I have come across salesmen that after their sales pitch I would ask the price of the vehicle. They would then ask me how much of a payment I could afford and never answer my one question - How much is the car with the discounts. I assume that just because I am a woman that they think I am vulnerable and would purchase the car at sticker price. You won't believe me on how many times I have walked away from the dealership. I did go back to one dealership twice, only because they had the vehicle that I really wanted. I went to another salesman. He was sincere and I purchased the vehicle.  This dealership (World Car Hyundai) was the first time that I entered and purchase the car at first sight. What was funny was that I just wanted to replace my 2003 vehicle and I ended up not only replacing the '03 vehicle but also the vehicle I was currently driving. The Genesis just spoke to me to get it.  Rene help me to select the other vehicle that was suppose to replace the '03 vehicle. He went out of his way looking for the one that met all my requirements. My only regret was that I kept him past his work schedule. He also had plans with his family but he stayed past closing time to show me how the car worked with all the gadgets. We seem to have bonded like old friends. He made sure that the second car would work for my needs.

Dealership (World Car) wanted a cashier check. My bank stated that the check is what the standard for them is. Discussing financing with Dealership Finance Dept., I am using my same banking facility, higher interest rate, longer period. I stop process and was on point to walk away. I called my bank and received the original interest rate, period determined by dealer.  b. You have a 5/50,000 miles, (power train 10/100,000) yet the dealer wanted to sell me for an extra $40/month warranty. c. Called to have aftermarket, from same dealership, navigation system, quote about $4,000.00 - did not wanted sun roof or would have bought model with Nav sys.

I was told to come back the next day to get it all cleaned up and mats in proper place, etc. I did return, as soon as I could after work. I however live about 50 miles north of the dealership and didn't arrive til about 5:30 or so. They did rinse it and put mats where they needed to be, took off plastic, etc. They didn't really do a thorough cleaning though, as there was a handprint of somekind inside the driver door that I saw when test driving. It was still there when I left. So basically, I could have not rushed 50 miles away for that. I could've done what they did simply enough. Kind of a wasted trip. Thanks so much.",4.0

I never felt pressured about buying a car. He took me for a several test drives and explained all the details and functions of the cars. I fell completely in love with my car. The dealership has too many cars in the lot because it took hours for Alan to be able to pull my car out. I was at the dealership a total of about 10-12 hours. And when I wanted to just walk. Alan would inform me of everything that was going on and apologized for everything. I stayed due to his professionalism and down to earth personality. He even tried to take me over to finance to get the paperwork completed while they pulled the car out but due to some issues the dealership had before with vin numbers, the owner told him no and get the car out. No one helped him get the first car out so it took a while. The second car came out within 30-40 minutes after the monthly price negotiation process and that was because they helped him. I had to come back the next day because by the time they got the second car out the banks were closed. I worked with Alan and Bill. They were awesome and again the only reason I purchased a car.

I bought a limited 2016 Hyundai Sonata and I am very happy with it to date. I like all the options and perks that come with my purchase; like two years of maintenance covered by the dealership and 1 yr free service of blue link. I like that Hyundai didn't leave me waiting for a long time to process paperwork like other dealerships do. I was greeted by the first salesman that showed me my vehicle and although he couldn't do the paperwork for me I was left in good hands with Bill. I was also impressed that the fist car salesman remembered me later and asked how I was doing with my Sonata. It baffled me that he remembered me and my purchased vehicle, it definitely made me feel like an important customer and for that alone I plan to continue doing business with them. Don't get me wrong, I'm happy with my car and it's performance.",5.0

Negotiations should not have taken so long, waiting for the finance department to get to me should not have taken so long. By the time that process was finished, there was nobody available to wash the car. The salesperson did a quick rinse so that I could drive it off the lot. At that point it was almost 9:30 and we were both (the salesperson and I) hungry and tired!

I have taken excellent care of the vehicle, looks great I only wished the dealership cared about the maintenance and upkeep as well.  They do their best to deflect finding a resolution especially if you have purchased their dealer extended warranty.  I have been asked several times if I bought the car with them, has it been wrecked, or they tell me nothing is wrong paperwork states ""no problem found"" even if it was apparent when I dropped it off there was an issue.   The car alarm is still inop & the car has been with them now for two months in & out of the shop this year makes this a combined total of 6 months since APR 2015.

415,"November 30, 2015","I am nothing but disappointed with my entire experience since purchasing my new 2016 Hyundai Elantra at World Car Hyundai in San Antonio, Texas. I purchased this car mid October of this year and it has spent most of its life with me at the dealership sitting on the lot while waiting for repaires that were promised by both the sales man Jose and a sales manager named Henery who has since left the dealership. I was told my car had transport damage to the rear driver bumper and it would be repaired good as new the following week. When I showed up for my appointment Henery was not there and no one seemed to know what was going one or cared much to help. Fred asked if he could help and took in my car to be fixed. After staying at the dealership for three days my car only received a oil change and no repairs. I was then told another lie to come back next Monday and they will have it completed. I show up Monday the 23 of Nov and am back today Monday the 30th and there is a film on my car and Fred is not here to help me nor has he contacted his fellow coworkers to inform them of my car and that I would be in to pick it up. I work out of my car and now I am sitting in the lobby area waiting for them to detail my car in hopes that they can get the film off. When I asked what happened and why has a simple repair taken so long to complete they simply reply with shrugged shoulders ""I don't know"".  They have done nothing to help make up for my troubles or even offer a simple apology for all this, they simply tell me ""ugh just give them a bad review"". If anyone asks me what I think about my new car I will tell them don't buy one, go to Toyota or Mazda. It is now one day before Dec 1 and I purchased my car new on Oct 16,2015 and I still do not have it repaired to good as new as I was promised.  I came to this dealership with the high expectations of their supposedly well know world class customer service yet I have received the exact opposite of that. After signing that dotted line and walking out with my keys they simply forgot about me and felt no need to make good on their promise or good name.  This dealership is a joke and cares nothing about their customers other than selling them and taking their money. My next vehicle will most definitely be purchased elsewhere and most likely by another manufacturer.  ",1.8

World Car Hyundai was the only places that never once made me feel pressured or tried to push monthly payments. I got the exact make, model, and trim of the vehicle that I wanted, thanks to my salesman Billy Stratton. Who not only showed me every available trim of the Hyundai Tuscon that the dealership had in stock, but also Bill was concerned about the time my father had to leave to do his dialysis. The main reason I bought my Hyundai Tuscon from World Car Hyundai was because Bill Stratton was nice enough to go out of his way to show me my options of vehicle trims, when making the deal he never once pushed monthly payments, and I felt that he actually cared about my needs rather than just pushing me to buy a vehicle.",5.0

461,"April 10, 2015","Avoid this dealer and Hyundai as a brand as much as possible, here is why. 
I bought a brand new Hyundai Sonata 2015 on February 28,2015 from World Car Hyundai Nort, San Antonio, TX. On March 31, 2015 the car broke in the middle of the road, engine has overheated.So I called the towing company and transport the car to the dealer for diagnose. The following day I called them to ask about the car and they told me ''we need to replace the entire engine in order to fix it''.Dealer will fix it under warranty but that is not acceptable for me, for a car that was on the road literally 1 month and has only 1000 miles. This option  may make the car drivable but still impairs the value of the vehicle.I opened a case with Hyundai and BBB Auto Line, but Hyundai said no for replacement of the car or repurchase they want to replace the engine.I refuse to have a ""used car"" how dealer put it, with a replaced engine that most likely will be remanufactured new engine even if they sustain is going to be new out of the fatory.I know they can say whatever to me just to get me out of their back.If I want that I will buy a used cheap car, buy a new engine and I will have a used car with a new engine way cheaper, without a high monthly payment for the next 7 years. Car value right now , dropped about 30% with a replaced engine it will drop even more around 50% or lower depends on mileage down the road. So I am paying for a new car with a major repair and who knows what are problems this car has. This car is a lemon but dealer or manufactured trying to get away with it and make the customer supporting all this. I am making monthly payments for a car that is not operational, and dealer told me the problem is out of their hands. What they are doing now, they are trying to trade the broke car for the curent market value, and make me buy another one. They don't want to refund me or give me another functional new car out of the parking lot. On April 6 I went back to the dealer to ask for a phone number to call Hyundai regional office they told they don't have it, in the same day I asked them for a copy of the service worksheet to see exactly what they did to diagnose the car, they refused to do so. I had to go around them to someone else to ask for a copy of that paper, really? So much for customer care, they just don't care. Pretty much they took the money and now they are washing they hands trying to fix a lemon car. I had to get the phone number for regional office from the internet myself and get in touch with them. On April 9 Hyundai regional office called me with some options and I was willing to consider two of them, but I had to talk with the dealer for one of them. So I went to the dealer and find out that they fixed my car without my approval or signature, they also broke the car hood, they bent it and bent and scrat a portion of the car body. They also already ordered the hood and everything else to fix the car, again without me approving anything or them calling me and let me know what is happening with my car. Dealership manager said verbally they will keep the car there and they will work with Hyundai to give me a new one, hard to believe. After two weeks we are more in whole with my brand new car and no good resolution for me the client. So far the repairs of the car cost a bit over 9000$ listed as part not as engine. Who knows how much will be  with a new hood, body repair and paint. They also refuse to give me any copies of the service records, they told me I will have them when I will sign to take the car. They are doing crappy things there and Hyundai doesn't care.Now my only resort is to go to court which I will. Buying a Hyundai was the worse decision I have made. Hyundai is the worse car I have ever own.

484,"January 29, 2014","Let me begin by stating that I have never, ever had a bad customer service such as the one that I experienced at World Car Nissan in San Antonio, Texas.  I am sendng out this information out to let others know to be very careful with who you are dealing with when going to dearlerships in and around San Antonio, Texas.

Now with this being said, My credit is not perfect, bad to be very honest with you but I am also going through some medical issue that have me in a huge hole right now. So I thought I could go and try to change something to make my life a little easier. I saw this 2008 Dodge Charger on the WCN website, very nice looking car I might add but boy did they try to pull one over on me BIG TIME! 

First, I was promosed all kinds of things, first, I spoke with some girl who said was going to help me, I didnt realize it then but she only sets up the appt, she is not a salesperson, to make matters worse, she puts me in a ""VIP"" list to deal with a salesperson, and then, there I was like an idoit waiting for someone to come oustide and greet me..funny thing though, you could see all the salespeople smoking in one area, even worse when they get into the vehicle that you would like and they smell like cigarettes!!!

So I test drive this Dodge Charger and it has a funny drive to it and I mention it but it's like the salesperson was deaf or avoiding to answer my questions regarding the Dodge Charger and the trebbling of the streering wheel and the undercarriage. The Salesperson answer...wait for it, wait..."" it just needs a wash, thats all!""

So my wife and I are sitting with these salespeople and mind you, We've been there for almost 6 hours already! one salesperson came up to me and said, ""Hey, you will have to give up your Disabled Vet license plates!"". I'm like noooo, those plates are mine and they will go on to the new vehicle if I qualify. He goes on to state that no, there was a new law that took effect that states all DV license plates have to be turn in and I will need to pay for new ones!.............STRIKE ONE!

The second salesperon comes moments later and tells me that I will need to have my insurance card show the Dodge already on my insurance before they will look at trading in my Camaro!.........STRIKE TWO!

First salesperson comes back to me and states he's been in this business for decades, after I just watched him eat a HOTDOG in three chews and has mustard on him...way to go BIG GUY!!!  STRIKE THREE!!!!!!

Another salesperson comes up to me and says ""Hey, take the car with you and we'll see on Monday to go over the contract with finance."" Ok...wait for it....YOU'RE OUT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Now this is all on a Friday! well I stated to all the salespeople that I am not driving out with the dodge and I will wait for them to get back to me to see if and what I qualified for. Saturday goes by, nothing, sunday..closed. Monday comes and nothing..I called all the salesmen that I worked with and nothing, no returned calls...then I get a hold of a manager who stated this to me...""why should I have my guys waste thier time on you when we have other people with good credit waiting in lne to see us""...waiting in line? really? 

I left it at that and I stated, I should have at least gotten a phone call from WCN to say hey man, it didnt work out..sorry. NOTHING! ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FROM THEM.

Now just imagine if I had listen to the salespeople at World Car Nissan and had taken the Dodge Charger home! 

Becareful where you shop for a vehicle...I've learned my lesson here, I'll wait to get back on my feet again and go back to Ancira Chevy where I have purchased two Vehicles with John Llanes,

Took Adrian  Hernandez in Parts 1day and fixed the missing part issue that same Day

I had ordered the part and even one time on the phone one employee was gonna give hin my phone # to call me he never did. He told me I had to order with my credit card Then he lied to Daniel  saying he didnt get my card. He just Lied about it. And he ordered the Wrong Parts!

I even called Mr Wayne Wright to this date No Calls I Guess the South side area Dosent care what their Employees do to Customers . Since I havent had a call Yet from Him I left several messages and no calls yet.

IT shouldnt matters if its a $2,000 dollar part or $2.00 dollar part since I have ordered parts from there all the time to replace what breaks on my 2001 hyundai and 160,000 miles and still runs great.

What Aadrian Hernandez Parts Manager did was Take Charge of the Maddness.

He got the part I needed that same day and I then order more as back up. This all started when I had my last oil changer and they did put the Radiator resv cap back on they said It was like $2.00 or some thing even one of the cashiers say let them pay for it and I said no I would just replace it.I never thought it would take 2 weeks because Paul ordered the wrong item saying I had told him something else. That was another lies.

I even left several messages to Wayne Wright Gm to talk to him about all this and to this date no call . World Car soutside location dosent care about customers?


Its a Shame that Paul in parts treats people in this manner.

But Thank God for Adrian and Rick and the parts staff and even Rose and who ever answer the Phone They Did Everthing Right!! And I was Glad Adrian took charge and
even Linda Anderson They did what the south side location wouldnt and couldnt Do!!!",5.0

492,"February 03, 2012",Hyundai made it very easy to buy our third car. The process was very easy and fast. We will continue to come back. Great dealership!,5.0
493,"September 30, 2011",I am not one to complain but I haven't purchased a car in over 4 yrs and it was only my 2nd car I've ever purchased and the experience was horrible. I would never go back. I even purchased the warranty and I don't even want to go back if my car needs service. My sales rep was not welcoming or friendly and did not return my calls. I could've gotten a better deal elsewhere that would've made me a much happier customer! Oh well it is what it is...now I know for next time.,2.2
494,"August 26, 2011",When our car broke down Wendy made getting it fixed as easy as possible for us.  We were able to understand all the repairs and it was fixed very fast.  I will make sure all my friends know to come see Wendy whenever they need anything.  Thank you for your great service Wendy!,5.0
495,"August 08, 2011","I brought my old (1998) minivan in for help with a number of issues.  All 3 of these guys were AMAZINGLY customer service oriented.  I was blown away by the level of customer service I was shown, and how pleasant the overall experience was.  I felt like I was carefully listened to when I was describing my van's issues, and that --as a female-- I was not 'talked down to' like so many times happens when dealing with men in the auto industry field.  This dealership's service department clearly values good customer service.  Highly recommended.",4.8
496,"July 08, 2011","Each of my 3 visits to the service department, I was treated with anything from indifference to outright rudeness. On my 3rd visit, the service rep told me that I had to have my 15K mile maintenance performed at the tune of $450. He went so far as to threaten that my warranty would be null and void. After consulting our copy of the warranty, our manufacturer's manual and other Nissan dealerships we found that he was wrong. The only required maintenance was that listed in the manufacturer's manual. Anything else was recommended by the dealer and had nothing to do with my warranty. When we went in and brought this to the attention of the Service Manager, he said that this is their 15K mile service, period. When we asked why other dealerships offer the exact same service for $200 less and pointed out that his service rep lied to me, he said it didn't matter because they are number one in the area. We then spoke to the general manager and asked why they do not even attempt to be competitive, he said they didn't have to because their sales were up 40%. He then said that we must not be a good ""fit"" for them. We then went to Ingram Park Nissan who treated us with the utmost courtesy and respect! They completed the MORE than what World Car wanted to do and we were only charged $250. It was such a drastic difference in experience between the two places, that it was clear to us who cared for their customers and who is just out to make a dollar. Ingram Park has now earned our loyalty and repeat business. We will NEVER return to World Car Nissan.",1.5
497,"July 03, 2011","Very frendly and helpful, loved the service recieved. Price on vehicle was resonable and all of my questions were answered fully. I would recommend to all if they were looking for great service.",5.0
498,"June 30, 2011","The service was professional, courteous, friendly, and always in the best interest of the customer and the dealership.  Mr. Collins did not waste time in providing me with the information requested and it did not take much time at all.  He was upfront from start to finish and extremely helpful.  He is definitely an asset to this dealership.  He has always been ready and willing to assist and provide up to date news on offers and specials.  In considering a new purchase this dealership will be at the top of my list.",5.0
499,"June 25, 2011","Everyone was very professional, friendly, easy to deal with.  This was probably the best sales experience we've had in many years.  I would definitely recommend to anyone.",4.8
500,"June 16, 2011","I had bought a 2010 Santa Fe and had problrems with the Transmission, because at times it didn't know what Gear it wanted to be in. I had to bring it in three times. I fully understand why it had to be taked in three time, because it didn't have the Problem each time it was driven. The third trip was the key, because it was confirmed and the Transmission was replaced.
NOW, I have NO Transmission Probrems!",4.4
501,"June 14, 2011","I needed to purchase a new car quickly and from out of town.  Mr. Collins made the purchase easy, quick and problem free.  I expected to pay more because of the situation, but was pleasantly supprised to also get a very good price.

My new car purchase experience at World Car was the most pleasant, fast and hassel free that I have ever had.  I was also impressed with their honesty and the absence of pressure to buy items or options that I did not want.  I was offered various options and when I said no, we moved on the the next item.  No pressure and no need to bargin for the best price.

In addition the following were appreciated:
(1) When I picked up the car, everything was ready to be singed and all the costs were as represented.  
(2) The car was in perfect condition with a full tank of gas.
(3) The tires were high quality tires from the factory. (More times than not when I have purchased a new car the dealer has switched the tires to the cheapest tire they can put on the car.)",5.0
502,"May 09, 2011","THIS COMPANY IS POORLY MANAGED, UNPROFESSIONAL, AND NOT TO BE TRUSTED!!! I was told by management and the salesman that there could be nothing done over the phone or internet. They told me it was against the law and the ""Patriot Act"" ( A COMPLETE LIE) They even went as far as to tell me that all the other dealerships I had been in contact with willing to do such a thing were in violation and could be fined (ANOTHER LIE) I was promised that a vehicle was available and if I were to drive down from Austin, TX to San Antonio, TX after I was off of work at 6pm that we could work the deal (ANOTHER LIE). Oh they worked the deal, after rushing south in rush hour traffic, arriving at 7pm only to sit around for over an hour and half waiting to speak with the salesman while he worked another deal. Not a single employee (manager or salesman) said a word to me they all acted as if I wasn't even there. I get up to leave and decide to stop at the GSM's office and ask if there was anyone else that could help me. He lets me know he'll get the #s together and bring them to me, which he does. At 9pm my sales man finally comes over to speak with me. (Why I waited there that long is beyond me, but I did) After some negotiating on the price the salesman (Bill) tells me that it is too late and that we can't do the deal tonight (though promised we could) and that I will have to return to San Antonio the next day to complete the purchase. I told him it was a hassle and very costly to do that is there any way they could deliver me the car and paperwork once the upgrades were complete. His answer was no I then asked because of the circumstances (LIES and waste of my time) if they could compensate by tinting the Elantra. His (Bill) response was ""It's not our fault you drive a gas guzzling Jeep.""  Then the GSM (@ 1000pm no one else in the dealership) comes out to tell me it is not personal but that ""the owner will not let them use fax or internet nor bring the papers with delivery of the car to have signed. (IT HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH ANY LAW OR PATRIOT ACT ""AS THEY TOLD ME ON THE PHONE"" IT IS THE OWNER OF WORLD CARS RULE) @ 1030pm the GSM said he would have to ask the owner in the morning if he would throw in the tint for my incontinence. The next afternoon I have a voicemail ""Spoke with the owner and he said he will not do the deal we pass work something out at another dealership” After the experience I had with this dealership and its management I would HIGHLY recommend that anyone and everyone be warned and aware of the lies they tell and shady business they run.",1.8
503,"September 28, 2010","My husband and I were lied to and made a 4 1/2 hour trip to the dealership under false pretenses. We were told all we had to do is come in and sign the paperwork that the car was ours. After making the trip we were told that we were not going to get the Armada unless we would pay larger payments.  I had been on the phone with the sales associate for over a week before we made the trip.  We didn't want to make a long trip if we could not get the car we wanted.  I even called the day before and stressed to the sales associate we did not have to have a car right now and if we could not get the Armada I wanted to know right then, he assured me there was no problem getting Armada. I told him we could not make more than $450.00 payments a month and he said we would only have to pay $425.00 or less if they gave us more for our trade-in. The trade-in was $1000.00 more than he originally thought; so that would mean less than $425.00. When we arrived the sales associate took the keys to our car and gave us the keys to the Armada to test drive. Then were asked to wait in a hot cubicle for hours while our sales associate walked around looking out the door and eating something in a brown paper bag.  After speaking with the manager we left very unhappy and unsatisfied people. (obviously we were not customers)",1.0
