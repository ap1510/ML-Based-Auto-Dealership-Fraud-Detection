0,"March 22, 2020","Buying with James Wood was the fastest car buying experience ever! No pressure, got exactly what I wanted. Super friendly and personable. Melanie is awesome and I highly recommend. I’ve bought many cars in my life, including four GMC’s at another dealer in Plano, and I am glad I made the switch (and drive) to James Wood!",5.0
1,"August 09, 2019","Great Service!!! Shellie Tait, the sales agent, was very nice, and friendly. She was very quick to respond to calls and emails and was very helpful. She made the car buying experience very easy and pleasant. We were very satisfied with our experience at James Wood Autopark and glad we made the 4 hour drive to purchase a truck.   ",5.0
2,"November 08, 2018","Car buying experiences are typically something to be dreaded. However, working with Josh Jones has become something to look forward to. He is straight forward and makes the process seamless. We are on our third vehicle purchase from him and I have zero complaints. If you want a streamlined process with someone who is honest and communicates the process he is your guy! ",5.0
3,"April 02, 2018",My daughter took her vehicle to the dealership in Denton.  They kept the car overnight (and used nearly a 1/2 tank of gas in the process) to try and find the problem.  The only solution they had to her car stalling was to replace the negative battery cable.  The very next day the problem occurred again but they were unable to fit her in.  I called another dealership several hours away and they quickly scheduled her in and identified the problem within an hour.,2.0
4,"February 16, 2018","The techs at James Woods know their stuff and will fix your vehicle for sure.  That said, they are so EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE I pretty much expect them to come back with $2000+ worth of stuff to be fixed every time the check engine light is on.  I'm tempted to take a perfectly working vehicle in there under a fake name just to see if they come up with a whole list of things that need to be replaced.

So if you don't worry about dropping huge amounts of cash, then go here.  If not, try someplace else.  Or better yet, don't buy Chevy's or GM vehicles all together because they will suck you dry eventually of every dollar you have.",3.4

7,"February 25, 2017","Overall, my experience at James Wood Denton was good. I went in to buy a 2017 Chevrolet Trax. The car salesman who helped me was really cool, couldn't have asked for a better person....until after the deal was done. I was promised a new rubber floor mat for the back of my car, which he kept telling me he ordered, 2 months later and I still haven't received it. My paper tags expire in 2 days and I have yet to get my license plates. He told me they were in a different location and I was the one who had to call them about the plates. The biggest thing I am upset about is that had I known about it, I never would have gotten this vehicle, but it has no cruise control. The sales guy straight up told me he didn't know that and it really is a bummer. How would I have known that, it's a 2017 vehicle and it's got no cruise control?  Seriously?!?  Don't you think you should've said something up front??  I like the vehicle, but to be honest, I never would've gotten it knowing I would've gotten screwed around like this after the fact. I even tried to go to one of their managers about the cruise control and he didn't even get back with me. Heck, they could've at least thrown in a free oil change",4.4
8,"February 01, 2017","My experience at James Wood Autoplex was awesome! I found a car I liked online and sent in a email and had an immediate response from the internet sales manager. We set up a time and date and by the time I got there everything was already lined up and ready to go. The mannerism of the staff was another thing that caught my eye, even if I wasn't dealing with them directly I had several people come up and offer me coffee or anything to make myself more comfortable. As far as the the vehicle purchasing went, they got my payments where I wanted them and even sweetened the deal a little bit. Will definitely be doing repeated business with them and will be recommending everyone I know to give them a call if they're looking for the best deal there is!",5.0
9,"January 31, 2017",Very good experience great customer service  satisfaction very good acknowledgement of there inventory and products. Sales manager went above and beyond to find what we were looking for and for the right price ,5.0
10,"January 30, 2017",It was a very pleasant sale of buying my new 2017 Cadillac Escalade. Everything went so smooth. This is our second time to deal with James Wood Family. We will be back next time I'm ready for new vehicle .,5.0
11,"December 29, 2016","This place is awesome, I bought a 2016 malibu from David Stafford in October. The process was so easy and fast. I was there only a hour, and I'm not kidding you. He made sure I was satisfied and didn't rush me into buying. His customer service is beyond expectations. I would recommend James Wood Chevrolet, I never experienced such a great atmosphere until I visit here. ",5.0
12,"October 19, 2016","Out of town car buyer who recently purchased 2016 Infiniti QX60 from David Stafford (James Wood Autopark) and my experience can’t be any better.
David was very responsive and quick to answer all of my questions and he will definitely go extra mile to provide any assistance you need.
He also delivered my vehicle to Houston, Texas without any transportation fees and he also brought all the papers to my office (very convenient).
James Wood Autopark is selling very competitive price on their cars and I can assure you that you won’t be disappointed on the price and sales service.

I highly recommend James Wood Autopark for your next vehicle purchase whether you are out of town buyer like I was or local buyer but please go and see David Stafford for excellent service you deserve!!!

13,"January 11, 2016",I come here because it is close to my job. I have never been able to get out of service in less than 3 hours. I bring a work Truck and am required to wait on it. It's funny how an oil change cost 1000 dollars after they touch it. Anything and everything is broke. Just venting cause I have been sitting here for 5 hours waiting on another oil change plus 5 other issuses needing repair.  I think it's there way to get you to make an appointment. ,1.6
14,"June 29, 2015","Called Jason (manager) I was informed that I could not back out of buying the car, because I had signed the papers ( his words were this a no courticy law in Texas ).   I had signed the papers on Saturday wife went to pick the car up on Monday. The AC wasn't cold and it smelled like smoke.  Talked to the sales guy ( Floyd ) who wanted the car Dilivered to Denton so he could do his "" respectful"" checkup on the vehicle ( his words ).  He said the AC may need antifreeze (freon) n he didn't smell smoke.  He said they have a Smoke smell guy that could meet me at my house (Jason) later informed me the smoke guy only goes to their dealership and we would have to drive back to Denton to get it done.  James woods will no longer have my business new or used ",1.8
15,"June 14, 2015","Thank you so much for the exceptional top notch service you provided to my family.  My mom called me crying at 4:30pm the other day when the engine crapped out on their truck 1000 miles from home with a camper, dog, and my 8 year old son in tow.  After a couple long days of driving, that could really make for a bad start to a summer vacation.  Instead, my mom called me 4 hours later crying with excitement over how awesome her experience was with you guys.  She was so over the moon with excitement and happiness that she couldn't remember what kind of truck she purchased! Hahaha! She said to me numerous times, ""They are just the nicest people, Sammy"". Having their camper towed to a nearby lot with water/power hook-up's goes well above and beyond.  Standing out on the service drive awaiting their arrival goes above and beyond.  Turning a seemingly catastrophic vacation event into an even better vacation goes above and beyond.  My mom told me the next morning, after everything was finalized, that she cried when she said bye to her salesman, Danny and the sales manager Cecil, because they were just so nice.  My son kept ranting and raving over how much fun he had with the experience as well, and is still ranting and raving over how much he loves the new truck!  Thank you guys so much.  ",5.0
16,"February 19, 2013","My family and I were looking for a used truck. We saw one online that we liked so we headed out to Denton. We didn't know where the used cars section was and we ended up in the new Buick GMC section, where we met Ronnie. We asked Ronnie about the truck and he let us look at it and test drive. We liked the truck and the price was great! We ended up purchasing the truck that same day. Ronnie was always friendly and informative.",5.0

18,"August 01, 2012",We had an exceptionally great car sales experience with Chase.  We will definitely tell our friends about the great service we received from Chase at James Wood dealership.,4.8
19,"July 26, 2012","Wow!! 
What a wonderful experience! Our second new car purchase from James Wood.  We just cant say enough about our sales person, Chase Whaley. We purchased both times from him. We told him exactly what we wanted and he found the exact match!
It just doesn't get any better than this!  Prices were great and gave us top dollar on our trade in as well. The icing on the cake was when he delivered our new Yukon right to our front door!
VIP treatment at its best.",5.0

21,"May 12, 2010",This dealership is very customer friendly. They always perform the best work on time and professionally. They keep me updated on my vehicle and ask me if i would need a courtesy ride home while my vehicle is getting serviced. I would definately reccomend this dealership for everyone in the Dallas-Ft. Worth area. Thanks James Wood Autopark!,5.0
22,"May 15, 2008",I have bought several vehicles from this dealership and they are the best in the area. Always honest and friendly and always a great price. I would highly recommend them.,5.0
