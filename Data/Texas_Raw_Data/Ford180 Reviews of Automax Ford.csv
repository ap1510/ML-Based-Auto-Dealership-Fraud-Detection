1,"May 16, 2020","The service here was so bad. We worked with was extremely rude, ignored us. Pushed past us without saying anything. They didn‚Äôt call us to tell us our car was ready after being there almost all day. They didn‚Äôt even review with us what they did to the car. When we went to get our car they just left it outside with the key in it and windows down and didn‚Äôt let us know if we could take it.",1.0
2,"April 22, 2020","I had my 2000 f 150   Towed here with a brand nea pcm for programming over a week and a half ago tha service dept called told me the pcm was no good , so I let them replace it again . Last week they called needed hours to find a problem with something else  go ahead the guy assured me it would be done last Friday that was on wed. The15th apr. we called Friday multiple timed only to be hung up on three separate times our service guy wasn‚Äôt there .according to a different service man we talked to .this is Tuesday the 21 apr . He told us our service guy needed to talk to us but was not there today .xxx . Now it‚Äôs over 2 weeks you have my truck .its not fixed yet I‚Äôm sure if he calls today he is going to want more time still to do the programming it was about 200 dollars mow the pcm oh another 600 or so now 2;more hours another 250 oh another 2 hours 250 anyway so far we are at 1800.00 plus and not even a call from them for now 6 days ...

3,"April 08, 2020","Went to Automax - a one hour drive -because they had the truck with the EXACT options I was looking for. Did not know they were the highest rated dealership in Central Texas but discovered that over the course of my purchase. Salesman Terry J was outstanding - Everytime we had a question or wanted to play with the numbers on my deal - his response was ""too easy"" and ""no problem"" - and it was!! Everyone throughout the process made me feel important and respected and that they were there to help me! Have heard about car buying experiences like that but - at almost 50 years old and something like 15 purchases I have never had an experience like I did at Automax! AND - the experience continued after the sale with follow up! Amazing dealership, amazing customer service and one very happy customer! Again - thank you to my exceptional salesman Terry J!",5.0
4,"February 14, 2020",Worst service department I have ever been to in my life. I brought my 2016 mustang with only 33000 milesthat‚Äôs still under the limited power train warranty for a check engine light that couldn‚Äôt be read at Autozone or o‚ÄôReillys Autoparts.  It ended up being a simple purge valve that was 33$ but they wanted to charge me 480. They also said my connector was broke. When I asked how it was broke being so new they said they didn‚Äôt know. They obviously broke it during trouble shooting. They still charged me 150$ for a diagnostic check and broke my connector. The service rep was rude and disrespectful. Over priced and crap service. I will never go back. ,1.0
5,"February 06, 2020","Took my diesel truck in for a oil leak and to get my sunroof fixed Automax put me in a loaner and fixed everything that was broke and brought a few other things to my attention as well that needed to be done, I highly recommend ServiceMax for your vehicle repair.",5.0
6,"January 03, 2020","They make a mistake and instead of owning up to it and make it right, they want to make you feel dumb and have you pay for it. The Owner has gotten so complacent at the fact that He/She have big bucks, that they could care less about what goes on in there business. If a situation arises and you ask the General Manager to speak to the owners just know that they are always either on vacation, visiting someone at a hospital or at a funeral ( at least those were the excuses given to me). And you will never get anything except a ‚ÄúI spoke to the owners, and there is so much I can do‚Äù. Incompetence at it‚Äôs best!!!! It was a better place to purchase when it was smaller. After so many years I will definitely take my business elsewhere. I encourage EVERYONE to either do the same or at minimum do your own research about the vehicle you want BEFORE you get here and trust NOONE!!!! Although I have been purchasing my vehicles here since 2011 and believed I could trust them; I realize that the more they expand, the less they care about the customer! Too bad couldn‚Äôt give it Zero stars...",1.0
7,"December 10, 2019", We had the pleasure of working with Mr Julio Hinkson. He by far was the best car salesman I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. He was knowledgeable & made sure I received exactly what I wanted. He was friendly and treated us with the upmost respect.  Thank you for all your help Julio !!,5.0
8,"November 25, 2019","Asked to look at a VW Tiguan, was told car was being funded at the time. Looked at a few other SUVs asked about the Tiguan, I was told it had not been funded but was available. We looked at the car could not drive it secondary to unable to get the key until its funded. We made an appointment to come back and purchase the car when it was funded. I was called 3 hours before  we were going for our set appointment to be told the vehicle was sold! We spoke to the car sales men, the manager and a sales person from the VW with 3 different stories why the car was sold...This place is completely unorganized and unprofessional! I will never purchase from them. BEWARE!",1.0

15,"March 17, 2019","My family has bought 4 (new) cars now from AutoMax of Killeen, and my family has been very satisfied with their purchases. Max always ensures that if we don't see what we like or what might fall into our price range that he helps us find what will. He provides several options to fit our needs. The entire team makes us feel important and valued as AutoMax customers. I mean, we even have the snack waiting areas to sit in while we wait.  Our last visit we had Raymond  and Travis make our visit especially superb. We plan on the purchase of 2 more vehicles over the next year and we will be using AutoMax for our purchase needs. They are military friendly, try to get any discount possible for you, work with you on any trade in (whether you still owe on it or not), and work towards personally handing you your keys to your new vehicle. I have not been disappointed by Max or this dealership thus far, and I do recommend it to anyone seeking a great deal with superior customer service. Thank you Max for helping us achieve peace of mind with each purchase we've made :) ",5.0
16,"March 17, 2019",I purchased my new truck on the 22nd of February with the trade in of my older truck and as of today 17 March my trade in has yet been paid off. I have tried calling to see what was taken so long but didn‚Äôt get answers and my 2017 is already on sale at the dealership also I will have to pay another note on my older truck if not paid off before the 23rd of March.,3.8
17,"March 13, 2019","I chose to go to Automax because I‚Äôve always had great crustomer service.  I was able to work with Mr. Reggie and Mr. Gentles when looking for and financing a used vehicle. They made the boring, business process simple, quick and enjoyable. I‚Äôd recommend Automax and working with these two when looking for your next vehicle. üòÑ",5.0

Apparently remote start list it‚Äôs program and I called today and was told to set up an appointment so I wouldn‚Äôt have to wait.
Ben Butler kept me informed of the repairs. Awesome service dept!!!",5.0
20,"February 22, 2019",My experience at Automax Ford was nothing short of awesome.   These two individuals along with the Financial manager were very informative and professional throughout the entire process.   They knew what I was looking for and met my need.  I will without doubt highly recommend this company and these individuals to everyone I know looking to buy a vehicle.  Thank You for and very pleasant experience. ,5.0

22,"February 12, 2019","UPDATE;  My husband and I went into dealership and talked to 2 of the General Managers, Tim Ward and Jesse Garcia and once they saw all the documentation on my issue with my car, they were very helpful and my salesman showed me the new 2019 version of my vehicle which was cheaper that what my vehicle was.  They signed it out to me for two weeks while they try to show FORD what my issue is.  I told them I didn't think ANYONE should be sold that vehicle due to it's unreliability!!  They assured me that they will work it all out!  I will update on the outcome!

My first issue with this dealership is went in to buy my son a car (which took 6 hours) and was persuaded to buy myself a new SUV.  (yes, we bought 2 cars from them in one week!!)  I traded in a 2016 Lincoln Navigator that I leased from Johnson Brothers Ford in Temple/Belton.  The first issue was that I had to resign my paperwork several times due to the finance department getting the paperwork wrong a few times.  Then I get notice from Ford that they never paid off my trade in and I had a late payment on my credit!!  It decreased my credit score over 50 points!!  I don't have a single late payment on any of my bills!!!  They fixed it and Ford took the late payment off of my credit but the score has never completely rebounded!!  
Second is the service issue I have had with the car/truck.  My SUV has gone into DEEP SLEEP MODE 8 times and has to be jumped by a high powered battery.  I have been stranded at the lake on a 105 degree day in which the Ford Road Side Assistance stated they couldn't come help me for 1 hour and 45 minutes and the service department at Automax said they didn't have anyone to send, another time at the lake where my husband had the jump the car, at a convenience store out by the lake after my husband had left to go to work, once in my garage at my home and at my office 3 times!!  Each time it's been an physically and emotionally exhausting experience. It's been in the shop 4 times.  The first 3 times they checked EVERYTHING and said that there was nothing wrong with my car....This time, when I told them that I just couldn't take back a vehicle that stranded me like that, they changed the battery and now want me to pick it up again!!  Ford won't take my car back under the lemon law due to the dealership claiming there is nothing wrong with my car!!  I am so overwhelmed by this!!  I just want the money I put down on it and get a different model.  My salesman, Harvey has been wonderful but I can't seem to get the General Manager and the Owner to understand what this is doing to me and my family!!",2.6
23,"February 01, 2019","I came in and gave them an offer. We agreed on a number. Still couldn‚Äôt get the car after they knew I traveled over an hour and wouldn‚Äôt give me the keys back to the car I was trading in. I finally get the car, the change the price that we agreed on. I give them a check for the amount they wanted and it‚Äôs been a month. The bank still hasn‚Äôt received the check to pay off the trade it. They‚Äôve hung up on the bank three times. They are rude and unprofessional. I hope the owner sees this and contacts me!!!",1.2
24,"January 20, 2019","Do Not due business with Automax Ford Service Center! On Oct 5, 2018 I  Took my truck in because of a check engine light, It took them two weeks to actually fix the issue. Kristopher Dearing was the service adviser.  After the first week, they had stated it was fixed, I paid the bill of $2809.00 . They apparently could not find the trouble based on the codes, so they just kept replacing parts  until the check engine light went away. They even recommend a total tune-up on a truck with less than 50,000 miles, This cost $211 alone for 8 spark plugs and wires, and another $460 for labor,  when the  service for a tune-up is not due until 90,000 miles. They charged $125.57 for a so called fuel induction service, that consisted of  a $35.00 charge for a can of spray cleaner, and labor. This after I told them it was a waste of money and I don't want it. Thank you Kristopher Dearing. My truck had the bump/slip driveshaft issue that is listed under a Tech bulletin. Not only did they overcharge  to fix the issue @ $309.00 ,but they actually charged a $115.00 diagnostic fee.  When I picked up the truck, I could not even make it out of the dealership when they check engine light came back on. They kept my truck another week, finally I requested to speak to the supervisor , David Stillsen who said the issues I had were over his head, and advised me to speak to David Brewer. Mr Brewer agreed that I should not have needed a full Tune-up, and agreed to refund the cost of the labor for the tune-up. During our conservation , I leaned they had driven my truck to Nolanville and back but I had 52 miles extra on my truck, which is more than a round  trip to and from Nolanville. He also told me 3 people did the test drive. The person in the rear seat got grease all over my door and seat and literally broke the door latch in half. The did not tell me about the damage, and I ended up taking it back just to fix the damage which Mr. Forte another service supervisor agreed to fix for nothing. According to David Brewer the final issue with my truck was a folded over gasket that was sucking air, which I simply did not believe. I did not get the refund as promised, and went to speak to the General Manager, ( apparent they have 3) and ended up speaking to James Bilello Sales Manager who indicated he did not have the authority to refund any money without first speaking to a General Manager and the owners. This went on for over 4 months, and more visits. I learned Mr. Brewer had been fired during my first visit with Bilello. During my second visit with Bilello he filed out paperwork to request the $460 refund, but I never received it.  This dealership will promise the moon, but beware they are not going to do anything to fix any customer service issues. They kept telling stories, in the hope I would  go away.  Do not bring a vehicle to Automax for anything other than warranty repair, they are unethical and will do and say anything to separate you from your money to including doing things you told them not to do. I will need to take them to small claims court if I expect to get resolve this issue. Finally,  I actually took my truck over to Johnson Brothers in Temple Texas  @ a cost of $185 to make sure Automax had actually replaced the parts they claimed they replaced, When it came to verifying the fuel induction service, I was told there is no way to determine when such a service is need, that  it is recommend  based on miles, and that there was no way to determine if it had actually been done.  Do Not trust these people to deal with you in any honest or professional manner. The US Army should put this place of limits for all Soldiers. ",1.8
25,"January 18, 2019","Tim Ward, It was good till the end. Notice after the fact the $2000 plus 0 % they decided to forgot the $2000 discount. Delivered a $42000 new vehicle with 4 low tires and told to go across the street to get air in the tires. Still have not taken care of the tires. Possible have leaks All four of the tires. Then you try and sell a 2017 Mitsubishi Mirage for $12580 when your own web site says it‚Äôs only worth $6900 as a trade or retail for $8900 New. 2019‚Äôs go for $1000 more or so. Wow!

26,"January 18, 2019",Excellent service-salesman and finance employee had most of the work done before I arrived. I also received a message the next day asking how I like my car. I would use this dealership again and recommend them to others as well. ,5.0
27,"January 03, 2019","The buying process was somewhat seamless from beginning to end, however this was my first time buying a pre-owned car so I was completely naive. I was not aware that I needed to negotiate a 2nd key or floor mats for my car. Now I have to pay these expenses out of pocket which is not cheap. Daynell was super nice but didn't offer any additional information other than what I asked. Service & Finance Department are awesome so far. Overall, I would purchase from Automax again but armed with car buying knowledge. ",4.2
28,"January 02, 2019","Fui a buscar un carro y escogi uno gris de 4 puertas a√±o 2017, lo revice y una puerta trasera izquierda no abr√≠a porque la puerta estaba da√±ada por dentro, lo cambie por otro que es color plateado supuestamente a√±o 2017, firme el contrato de compra y al √∫ltimo nos dimos cuenta que era un 2016.

29,"January 02, 2019","I went there with my son to buy a car.  Lovell and Samantha were our salespeople.  They did a great job.  I went back 5 weeks later and bought a car for myself.   Lovell  helped me with that one.  The process was fast as I knew pretty much what we were looking for.  They explained the differences in the cars we looked at and assisted us every step of the way.   I have always found Automax helpful but this time it was great.  I would never go to Connell Chevrolet as their sales people refused to assist me the one time I went there (Screw me once shame on you.  Screw me twice shame on me).   Price was average to good but was definitely in the market range as displayed on numerous websites for similar vehicles.

30,"December 06, 2018","If could I leave 0 stars I would but unfortunately it made me leave 1 star. When I purchased my vehicle from this dealership, I purchased extended warranty. When my sensors were not responding I took it into the dealership and they said this was not covered under warranty because it was due to a rodent which I'm not sure how they would even be able to determine if it was caused by a rodent. They have the WORST customer service. They took over a month just to diagnose my vehicle. Once the problem was found they took 1 week just to send me an estimate to send to my insurance. Now they are demanding me to pay for the work when we agreed that my insurance was paying for it. Now they are threatening me to take the rental I have and not fix my car. Even after calling and letting them know that my insurance was working on the claim. Never buy a car there or getting service because they will RUIN your car!",1.0
31,"November 26, 2018",the service department is a joke here make appointment for one thing and add other to the appointment and get told they cant look at it on this day because we sont have a  technician  on duty that is   capable  to trouble shot the problem with my truck  i will never recommend this place to buy from or  have service done there,1.0
32,"November 24, 2018",Automax call you and make an appointment with you and you take your car over to have it serviced and show up an hour and a half before your appointment time and sit there for 4 hours and get no service. I would never take my car there again for service.,1.0

34,"November 08, 2018",This is the 3rd vehicle I have purchased from Automax and by far this was the easiest and best car buying experience to date thanks to Howard Dunn.

35,"November 08, 2018",Kind of a slow process but I am satisfied with my new 2018 Ford EcoSport. A little disappointed in the referral mentioned after I was done signing the paperwork. My sister and her husband are the ones whom referred me to Automax because they bought a vehicle once before from you.I was told from Aaron that the referral was supposed to be written into the deal so it was to late already to give them the 200.00. I don‚Äôt think that is right but that is fine. Thanks,4.0
36,"November 07, 2018","Niece needed a car and had a budget but they convinced her to spend more and knowing her credit was shot, a co-signer was needed to close the deal. Well, the financial paperwork was totally incorrect in that they were making the co-signer the Primary Buyer and my niece as the co-signer and then the Primary Buyer was to sign a power of attorney gifting the car to the co-signer. Wrong!! Tried to call the finance dept for 2wks and never could get the person and then played phone tag for another week. Finally mailed papers back unsigned and gave car back to them!! Unbelievable!! I felt this auto dealer was more interested in closing the deal and did not care about the customer. If they had completed the paperwork correctly then they would have closed the deal but telling the co-signer whose credit score was 875 that having them listed as the Primary Buyer didn't matter and then charging them 8.25% interest was absurd! Had my niece go to a different dealer and will never again go to this dealer. ",1.6
37,"November 03, 2018","If your salesman promised something, look no more, Terry Johnson did that, he honored the contract and kept me informed the status on my 2018 Ford 150.

38,"October 31, 2018",We went to a dealership down the street looking to trade in our truck for a more cost effective fuel efficient vehicle.  The numbers they quoted us were ridiculous so we came in to Automax Ford and William met us right out front and took the time to ask what we actually wanted and what worked for our family.  He showed us a variety of vehicles and we were able to narrow down exactly what we wanted and ultimately we bought our new car because we got a very fair trade in price for our truck and a great price on our new vehicle! We've had it for a couple weeks now and we are SO happy with our purchase.  ,5.0
39,"October 30, 2018","Air bag recall 10 am appt was going to take approx. 2 hours for work do be done, Tech checked to see if part was on hand, it was.  Waited in service lounge for 2 hours then checked on progress, car still sitting in same spot. Your suppose to know that 2 hours is from the time they actually start work. Took shuttle home and planned to pick up at close of business. Got voice message that part was not available around 2 pm.  At this point I decided to leave car overnight, with message to call me when part arrived and work started on recall. No call the next day. I called and was told vehicle was being worked and needed an hour more. 2 hours later I arrived and vehicle was not ready, had to wait an hour for keys and vehicle to be brought forward. I got in car yesterday for first time after driving it home from service and immediately noticed steering wheel was damaged, leather marred and chrome scratched up. Took vehicle back today so they can view damage, now waiting for there findings. How dishonest to not inform me that they damaged car, had to find it myself, was told I had so many hours to report it, felt like i was being accused of damaging my own vehicle.  Should have read yelp reviews and visit Temple.  Oh with the part not there at repair time, they will over book for same repair, so if part is taken by another tech, the response I got was a shoulder shrug and that's how we do it here. Will update after there findings, maybe gain or loose a star.",1.8

66,"February 24, 2018","PLEASE READ! DO NOT BUY A VEHICLE HERE!!! These people are phonies, rude and disrespectful. I had been in touch with a sales rep named Fred McGee about a car on their lot. I live in Houston so this was a 5 hour round trip for me. Last weekend i had email about a specific car, told them I was not interested in any other car but this one. All throughout this week i was going back and forth with Fred on a GT Premium Mustang. I was able to get him to come down on the price so yesterday I took off of work early, my boyfriend and I made the trip up to check the car out. Upon arrival, they have the wrong car pulled, which he swapped out and the correct one checked out. We went inside to discuss numbers sine everything was okay so far. While doing paper work he fills everything out on the wrong car, we go back and forth about price, he goes back inside to the manager, (His name is Craig), 3 times only to come out with the internet price plus TT&L. I asked where is this price that we discussed on the phone, in voicemail recordings AND text messages. Fred seemed to get tripped up in words and could not explain his self so they leave it as ""there was miscommunication"". How so? I have the email where I specifically stated which one I wanted and we had been discussing. Sadly, I was willing to pay the TT&L on the spot and already had financing so they would have gotten all the cash for the car on the spot.  End result I was lied to, had my time wasted and left empty handed without a car and met some very rude people along the way. Avoid this dealer at all cost and take your business somewhere else so that you will be treated like you should when purchasing a car. ",1.0

71,"November 10, 2017","Please improve on providing defect free trucks to dealerships. I was proud of buying my first used F150 2013VIN: 1FTFW1CT0DFB19562, but the new one I recently purchased F150 2017 XLT VIN: 1FTEW1CG4HKE36238 was defective. This completely ruined my whole purchasing experience of counting on a reliable vehicle. Now no matter what comes to mind, friends and people at work tell me I should have bought something else instead of a 'Fixed Or Repaired Daily' vehicle. I understand factories are not perfect and 100% perfection off the assembly line is unrealistic. As a full time Army Officer I need a reliable vehicle not just for myself but also for my family, especially when I am deployed. Still after everything, it is what it is, and feel the way I feel, because of the defective ""brand new"" truck I purchased. Like I said, the dealership staff was still great, I just wish I purchased the faithful 'steed' I imagine when looking at Ford commercials and advertisements. It's not that do not want to recommend anyone, its that I can't based off my experience. The reasoning of deciding on good for commitments is because the only commitments I have now Is a car loan and a loaner truck the dealership let be borrow. The reasoning for neither agree or disagree is because if I shared my recommendation it would sound like, ""you should trade your old truck into Automax, because they will sale you a defective brand new truck. But do not worry, they will let you borrow a loaner while it is getting fix in their shop"". I think this would be unfair to the sales service team who assisted me.

I did return to speak with Tim who said he could work with me to exchange my vehicle for the same  or better vehicle I had and that he would run numbers to make it work. I was okay with that and made it known that I would take the same version I had or an upgraded version and then I went back to work that evening.

The next day I went back to the dealership to speak with Tim, but instead spoke with James. The conversation was mostly story telling from James of how great Automax is and what Automax has done for customers in the past. Then we talked about what my situation currently is. I purchased a new truck with multiple defects which later, after two week in the service shop comes out to be a wiring harness. The wiring harness is on backorder until Mid December. I said that I returned the truck the next day after I purchased it and wanted it exchanged if it cannot be fixed. I stated this to Jaime and he said Tim Ward would have to make that call. 

After I explained this to Tim and then James and even the person who sold me the truck Jaime, the best the company can due is provide me with a loaner truck and tell me to wait for the part. I was told by James that it would not make ""business sense"" for the ""new truck"" I purchased to be exchanged to the same or upgraded model due to the value of the truck being more than $5,000 less than what I purchased it or because the repair part is on backorder until Mid December.

This blew my mind, because the Truck has 68 miles dealership since the 16 OCT 2017. I purchased the truck on the 14 OCT 2017.

Today I spoke with Michael from Automax. He stated that I was in the best possible situation Automax could put me in and that my situation, ""Is what, it is"". I bought the .027% defective truck off the assembly line that is defective. Even though Automax does routine maintenance on the vehicles in the lots, they do not make the trucks they sale, that is the job of the manufacturer warranty. It was then relentlessly told to me that they are in the business of selling trucks, not making sure they work at time of sale. 

My case number is CAS-13393415-J7M0K6. Judy Rizzo is the person who is working with me. She calls and she answers my calls, but their is little to nothing she is able to do. 

Please agree to allow me or any customer return a defective vehicle back to any dealership without question if the vehicle has defects.

 

Please agree to allow me or any customer exchange a defective vehicle back to any dealership without question if the vehicle has defects for the same or upgraded model, without additional charges.

 

Please agree to allow me or any customer exchange, return, or terminate a loan if the new vehicle has a part on backorder for longer than 30 days if the new truck doesn't 100 miles on the odometer.

72,"November 09, 2017","Do not buy a vehicle from Automax Ford Killeen dealership. Read my full review on why? Day 1 I went to look to purchase a vehicle for my business. I was introduced by Alisa the sales agent to help me find a vehicle. She was very thorough and willing to do what it took to make the sale. When it came time for negotiating she was confident that she could get the sales manager to get to my offer. After few times going back and forth, the sales manger went down few hundred dollars but was not close to my price point. I decided to walk out of the deal but Alisa was confidant that she can still work with another manager and get it to my price point. I gave her the benefit of the doubt . After doing more research on the vehicle I noticed it would be a perfect fit for my business. So Day 2, I decided to revisit the dealership to see if they would come down on the price they offered on Day 1. I asked to speak to Alisa and they told me ""she does not work here anymore"" and her deal that I was making was unassigned, meaning any other sales agent can take her sale. I asked the new sales agent Patrick to pull up the info on the price we worked on from Day 1 and he told me they ""destroy"" that information for security? How do you destroy something that is considered on going. So the sales department claimed they did not have the negotiated rate documents from Day 1 and were not willing to look for it. I renegotiated with them again and going after few time back and forth we came to an agreement with my trade in vehicle. I asked to show the final numbers and they failed to do so until it was time to do financing. Once they finally showed me the numbers, I realized the offer was $900 more than the Day 1 negotiated offer. When I tried to explain this and since they ""destroyed"" the proof, the sales manager Craig who was pretty friendly at time of negotiation became very rude when I called him out on the price form Day 1 offer by hinting the financial agent to cut the deal with his hand gesture, by sliding his had by his throat and walked away with frustration. Since I spent all this time on the deal and really wanted the vehicle, I decided to move forward with the purchase. Side note, the financial agent Charles is one of the best person working there. He was a pleasure to work with. Day 3, after purchasing the vehicle, I got a phone call from Alisa congratulating me on my purchase? They told me she was not working there anymore. To show negligence during the sale process, they lied to me about their sale agent and gave her hard work commission to another agent who just fell in at the right place at the right time and while doing a switch and bait on my deal. So the Automax Ford of Killeen, TX is rude, unfaithful, deceiving to their customers and their hard working sale agents as well. This is why they get a 1 star review from me. Even tho they do not  deserve any star in my opinion. 

Few small but important things to note: 
When asked to see the car fax and get info on the history of the vehicle and owner, they went around in circles and never gave me the information I requested, rather I had to do my own research. I asked for a second key fob, I still have yet to get it. I had less than quarter tank gas left in the vehicle when I drove off their lot. Didn't realize until I got home.

Be ready to stand in their show room as your making the deal, no customer courtesy to ask you to sit at a sales agent desk while negotiating especially when someone is purchasing a vehicle at over $40,000. These guys do not negotiate, so if your looking to get a deal and want good customer service where their sales agent are appreciated look elsewhere as I do not recommend anyone buying from Automax Ford Killeen TX. I hope this review will help you avoid what I went threw and know what to expect if you decide to shop at this location. It takes a lot for me to write a bad review as I am in the customer service business myself but this was an easy decision. Not recommended, look elsewhere in the area.",1.0

18 Jul 2017, I made a trip to this dealer to have some break work completed.  But,   I really think this place is more about making money than anything else. I had already been told by Firestone that my left rear rotor was warped, so decided to have it taken care of.  I left  my truck with a request for a estimate prior to any work. They decided to do a complete brake check, which is not what I requested. I just wanted a new rotor and a rear brake job. They called and told me all 4 rotors were warped, and they could not be turned, The told me the cost was $650. I was also told I had to pay $51 as an estimate fee, if I did not do the work with them.  I just did not believe them, so told them I would get my truck and take it elsewhere. I arrived 45 minutes later, and the truck was still in the back, wheels still off. Another 45 minutes and I finally got my truck back. In the meantime, I want to make it clear the two ladies at the cashier desk, were very nice and one even took extra effort to get them working on giving me my truck back. The Service tech,  a female could have cared less. While waiting, a gentleman, who turned out to be the service manager stopped  to speak with me. I told him the issue, and as the truck was being brought to the front, he explained that the rotors may be too thin to turn. He also informed me warped rotors are a problem with F150's ,  He then informed me that rotors are about $200 each for my truck. Wait a minute  it that is the case how is my estimate only $650 with rotors and brakes something doesn't add up.  Frustrated with these people, I took my truck to Break Check.  Mind you I don't have much trust in Break Check due to past experience with them and the way the try to pressure you  into the work.  I learned by Break Check that yes all 4 rotors were  warped,  this is a problem with Ford trucks. But they were able to turn my rotors and do a break job for $650. The offer a lifetime warranty on  all break parts.  Ford only offers 2 years. My truck is 7 years old but only has 39,800 miles. So anyone with any car knowledge knows that a break job with this few miles is just not the normal thing.  While I did save money I still am not to elated with Break Check, because I have read that they use substandard pads that wear quickly, so I will wait and see. In the meantime, I will purchased new after market  slotted and drilled rotors and pads for the next break Job. You know it is really bad when the Ford dealers people make the decision for the customer, ( ie, new rotors vs turning them).  Another problem is while I did not have to pay the $51 estimate fee thanks to the service manager, if they had told me up front about this fee I would not have gone there to begin with, as estimates are given for free in a number of auto maintenance facilities in Killeen. Finally,  I still don't get the $200 for each rotor, as per the service manager, and the estimate was for $650,  I mean really, my addition tells me that $200 x 4 is $800 just for new rotors, what was the $650 estimate for the break shoes, and labor.  I need to take my own advice and stay away from this dealer, as I really don't think they are honest or know what they are doing.",1.8

Without Terry Johnson I'd still be driving a car I didn't want anymore and I thank him for that.",5.0
88,"July 02, 2017","First of all, a factory covered repair cost me almost $1000 out of pocket and it was from a mistake by the mechanic to begin with, so it should have cost me nothing. They do an oil change and put in 2 quarts too many after I already informed them of thr capacity. Had I not checked, it would have destroyed a shelby gt500 engine (NOT COVERED)took almost 3 hours to correct the issue.  Like an idiot or glutton for punishment I purchase a new vehicle, mainly because of time constraints and the incentives offered by ford. After two attempts to test drive a vehicle, it was another 4 hours for them to complete the deal. They lied and said car was being inspected for pre delivery checks, but nobody in the shop was aware of what was happening. Manager told them to get on it right away, the guy thry asked to do it said he never did one before. This was after taking almost 6 hours to bring car from other dealership 52 miles away. I went in at 11, got to drive the car around 6-630. They couldn't give me spare key because it was almost 10pm and everyone gone. They knew I'd be there the next day. Key wasn't ready. Couldn't get it because they were gone. They didnt clean the car at all, tape residue still on the car, you could still see the imprint of the other dealership's logo on the back, there was an orange stain on most of the black rubber. 


Went back to get key Friday, and to set door code. An hour and a half later I get the key. After the salesmen put in wrong code it was another 30 minutes before he figured out how to reset it.  I went to speak to manager jessie Garcia. It was two hours before I actually saw him. He said he'd talk to service manager and see what could bd done. During this time, one manager answered his phone and just walked off as if I was never there. 20 minutes later I see him. His name is Ramon if you're wondering. So while waiting for jessie to return, I get call from automax. Apparently they needed info for my payoff. I asked what I could do, informed her I was in the showroom and she said you can't come back where I am. I asked why can't she come to me, I'm 20 feet away. She blew me off and redirected the conversation. I asked again how can I help and she hung up on me. Her name is Melissa or something similar. Enraged I had to leave. I left message to have jessie call me once he got an answer. Since I requested to speak to owner and jessie says he doesn't work weekends and walked off and then another manager informs me the owner doesn't come in on weekends. I asked when is friday a weekend? He replied he aint here Monday either and walked off. Over 5 hours later jessie returns my call after I sent numerous texts to james (awesome manager) and wasted all that time.

 I offered solutions and kept getting hit with more random texts. I was expecting a call from general manager and was surprised it was jessie, after I told them I'm done talking to the current managers (in total I've spoken to 7 managers, so far). I mispoke that jessie was supposed to call back and he went off. Didn't give me the opportunity to explain that i left a message for him to call me. He started talking louder and over me like I'm some kid, when I slipped and said a cuss word during the conversation ( you can imagine how mad I must have been) he got louder and more interruptive and began acting as if I went off on a drunken sailor swearing contest. And had the nerve to say he felt disrespected after the ordeal I went through with them already. As if he was the victim and I owed him. So I returned the favor of the previous employee and hung up on him.  


 My neighbor's son also had a bad experience with them when he purchased his ecoboost mustang.   I recommend any dealerships over the automax franchise. I'm a well decorated vet that purchased a $31, 000 vehicle the day after memorial day. Now I know how the returning Vietnam vets must have felt.   I escalated my issues with service department to ford corporate, the rep they gave me never replied back to messages left.

  I strongly advise getting service done at other dealership and purchase as well. Automax complex doesn't seem to care, takes forever and ford corporate will just tell you all they do is sell franchise rights, they can't intervene with the dealerships. Probably why she never returned calls. They also had the nerve to practically beg me for an A+ review.  They didnt schedule first maintenence, which is no problem because I'll never let them service my car. I can go on and on, but I think this gives the gest of it. my dad has been a ford fan since he can remember, his favorite is the 1956 ford. i told him to pick out any vehicle he wanted. his first car of choice was ford taurus sho. i had him check out a new accord first. he liked it. we saw the new taurus sho at a dealership that showed being open, but was actually closed. on the way to the their second store, a blue vehicle at the mazda dealership across the street from the ford dealership caught my dad's eye. he is now driving a brand new 2016.5 mazda cx5 with 4 miles on the odometer in which i paid cash, and it isn't blue. my father is no longer a ford fan after driving and seeing the mazda and also hearing my wife tell him how much she loves her mazda 3. i am aware i will take a huge hit, but i am already looking to get out of this ford that i purchased for anything but a ford. thinking sti, or older twin turbo supra or 300zx. something to build and turn heads at car shows and doesnt have a blue oval on the front. by the way, i gave up their offer of first payment on them, a $200 store credit, car wash and lifetime oil changes so that i could submit an honest review to ford corporate. sadly, the left hand man of the owner told me that he could easily call back customers that had oil changes done that day and find  enough that would agree to give them 5 star reviews and bury mine so deep that it would not be found, or enough that they would negate it and raise the average. he bragged many times about the number of presidents awards he's won and how he's turned over the numbers at automax in just over 7 months. well, now i have a good idea how it was done. buyer beware. just so you know, the msrp was the same in virginia as it was here in texas. i recommend that you purchase from other ford dealer. i can't speak on the rest of the automax area, but since i asked to test drive a fully loaded hyundai elantra gt and the salesman wanted me to drive the base model because it would take to much effort to get that one out, but if i do the paperwork he can get it out for me. not all cars drive the same ,but i guess he thought they do. or he thought i was stupid. either way, he was wrong

They are driving buisnes away, the Mustang was $36000, left the place and traded in for a $46000 Camaro across the street for the money I was expecting to pay for the Mustang, feel sorry for the sales guy having their business walking away to competiton by incompetent finance staff",1.4

93,"March 19, 2017","My wife Christine and I on Thursday, 2 March 2017, found a used 2008 F350 King Ranch 4x4 crew cab DRW in the Auto trader internet site which listed vehicles for Automax in Killeen, TX. We called Automax and Daniel V took the call 5 minutes before closing time. The unit was just taken in as a trade-in and had not gone through their service center yet. We drove from Albuquerque, NM to Killeen, TX on Saturday to see the truck before our Monday delivery. The service manager came in and said that the 2008 had too many issues and gave us some options. This is when we met Sales Manager, Robert Smith who was in the control room with the Owner Bradley. Robert met with us at a front desk and an employee drove another vehicle around that also had just been traded in. It was a 2013 F350 4x4 crew cab DRW but needed to go through their service process. We agreed on a price with the truck to be serviced and ready for the road before delivery. Robert and I shook hands to confirm the deal. Diesel truck owners seem to be taking off their Diesel emissions systems a year before they need a Texas State Emissions sticker here in Texas and then trade in at the last minute. It took till 1400 Thursday, 9 March for the 2013 to be ready for delivery and we took it for a test drive with head mechanic Thor and sales manager Robert who came in on his day off to make sure the vehicle was ready and delivered. Christine and I drove to El Paso, TX the 1st night, then to Phoenix, AZ for the next 2 days where we bought a full size camper for our new used truck. We drove back to Albuquerque, NM with the camping package and the truck ran strong. We are very pleased with the professionalism that Automax showed my wife and I. Thank you, Bradley, AG, Tim Ward, Robert Smith, Daniel V, Lance Chaney, Martin Franklin, Bill Connor, Mechanic Thor and his apprentice and everyone who helped in this purchase.",5.0

Kenneth Whiehead was our salesman and he did an excellent job; he was responsive and allowed us the freedom to check out the vehicle without standing over us or hounding certain features, etc. Overall, I would work with him again. 

Because we had financing through USAA we did not work with the finance dept. at the dealership. The manager we briefly worked with was a bit pushy on this subject, starting out with ""Well, I'm not going to bash USAA but..."" though he did back off when we made it clear we were not interested in financing through the dealership. The finance guy we worked with for finalizing the paperwork was great, though I cannot remember his name.

153,"March 08, 2016","This dealership was a nightmare for my family and I. We scheduled a test drive and called the day before, the day of, and an hour before arriving to confirm our appointment. When we arrived, the salesperson, Dwayne, and the vehicle were not up front.

My wife and 3 kids and I waited for about 15 minutes for Dwayne to show up with the vehicle. Then he informed us that it was almost out of gas and he needed to fill it up. I waited another 30 minutes in another building in the dealership before he showed up and said that he couldn't get a gas voucher. So we drove to a gas station and he put some gas in it. So far, we've been there for an hour and the test drive was just starting. Not a good beginning.

While I was gone on the test drive, my wife asked some employees at the front desk of the dealership if there was a private/secluded place where she could nurse our baby. She was told she could nurse her in the bathroom. Does anyone else eat their meals in the bathroom? No? Then neither should our infant daughter.

After the test drive, we agreed on a price for the vehicle and I asked that the vehicle be filled up with gas before we leave. Remember this, it'll be important later. We wait another 30 minutes before my driver's license and insurance paperwork are processed (both are valid and not expired) before we move to the sales building. There, we wait for another hour before we are able to be seen by a finance person. We were paying cash, but had to complete the transaction with a person in the finance department. We were actually packing our stuff up to leave before Dwayne came running in the room telling us we could finally check out.

After completing the transaction and signing all the paperwork, the vehicle is waiting at the front of the dealership, but the employee in the detailing department has walked off with the key in his pocket. I wait another 20 minutes before he is located and brings me the key to my vehicle. Finally, I thought, we get to go home! Lo and behold, I turn the vehicle on and see there's only a few gallons of gas in the tank despite my earlier (and agreed to) request that the vehicle be filled up. We have an hour drive ahead of us, so a full tank would have been appreciated.

I tell Dwayne and he insists on getting into my vehicle to verify what I'm saying is true. Then he goes and talks to...someone for 5 minutes, comes back, and tells me it's the dealership's policy to only put 5 gallons of gas into their used vehicles. Policy is one thing, but when you agreed to a full tank, put a full tank of gas in the vehicle. He goes off to ""work something out"" with his manager and I decided to take my family and go home. He called and texted me telling me he had gas vouchers for me. I asked him to mail them to me and he said he couldn't, but that my first oil change would be free. At a dealership that's an hour away from my house.

This dealership is inefficient, slow, and its employees are ineffectual and downright rude. We were lied to and although the final price of a full tank of gas was about $35, I feel that after paying tens of thousands of dollars, a couple dozen on their part to fill up the tank, especially when it was agreed to, is not out of the question. I will never purchase another vehicle from this dealership and have told friends and family about our experience. It was such a bad experience that I want to make sure people using Edmunds.com to select this dealership (as I did, based on the only review) know that this dealer is not all they're cracked up to be. Be prepared to waste a ton of time and be lied to if you attempt to purchase a vehicle from this dealership or from Dwayne.",1.6

The employees are nice but some times it takes awhile and i find my self falling asleep in the waiting area. the last i was there for a oil change i was checked in by a guy named eddie i seen him an hour later walking other customers to the cashier counter as he walked back to the front with that customer i  raised my hand to get his attention. he seemed as though he didn't even recognize me. them another gentleman named David asked me if i was being help an if theres anything he can help me with i told him i wanted to know the status of my vehicle. he said he'll check for me just give him a few minutes he came in five minutes with my receipt an a few papers i had to sign. an told me i had a recall on my vehicle. he well mannered  an convinced me to make a appointment for my recall. he called me the day of my appointment to confirm i was still able to come in. when i got there i told it cant take no longer then two an half hours. he then called the tech an asked if they where able to work on my vehicle an told them i needed it back soon. he told me it might take three hours an i said ok but no longer then that. after he checked me in an brought me snacks he also called me twice to update i never even got to look for him. he was very attentive. he called me back a third time to tell me  the tech is almost done an he would get me after he's done with the paper work. he came to the waiter in less then thirty minutes to walk me to the cashier. he asked the cashier for the keys an told me he would make sure my car would be ready for me so i wouldn't have to wait outside. before i was even done with the cashier he walked back in as the cashier was handing me my copy of the receipt an said the car is ready for me an walked to my vehicle parked out front. on the way he explained to me  how my vehicle did during the multipoint . i asked him for his business card but he said he didnt have one an circled his name and automax's phone number on my receipt an told me to just ask for him. not only did he beat his promise time but he made sure i was well informed. i told him i would only ask for him for now on.   he really an truly the best adviser i ever had,5.0
159,"October 06, 2015","I arrived early to have an express oil change completed on my F-150, I was first in line. At 7:30 a  service advisor asked me what I needed, I told him an oil change. He said that is Eddie's area, and went inside to speak with Eddie, he came back and said Eddie will be with you in a minute, 10 minutes later another service advisor asked me what I needed, I told him an oil change, just like the other advisor he said that it was Eddie's area, and went inside to tell him I was waiting. ( from what I could see from my truck, Eddie was either working at the computer or on the phone). So this same adviser comes back and starts to do the paperwork for the oil change, he asked me if I wanted a car wash, and explained it would take 1.5 hours to get both the oil change and car wash. I told him no I just want an oil change. Now its about 7:45. I wait until 8:30 before I start asking what is taking so long. Between a cashier, the sales manger ( or someone claiming to be the sales manager)  and another service advisor, I am told after a 10 minute wait, that my truck is almost done. Finally at 9:00 my name is called.  Now the cashier lays out 4 sets of paperwork, 3 appear to be the same, while one indicates the last time I went to this dealer ship, which was back in early 2014.  The cashier ask me to sign each set of paperwork, I wonder,  why in xxxx do I have to sign each copy of the paperwork, haven't they heard of carbon less paper  that makes multiple copies at the same time?  The cost for the only change is listed as $56.05, and the millage is listed as 21,326.. I indicated that I have never paid this much for an oil change, my comment goes without response, and then I indicate that the mileage listed should be 31,326. They give me some excuse that they can't go back into the computer to correct the mileage.   I am tempted to ask, if an oil change and car wash takes 1.5 hours, why does it take 1.5 hours for just the oil change.. but instead I just let them know that now I remember why I haven't been back to the dealership since 2014, xxxx Poor Service.  If I am the first guy in the express line, I should be in and out in 30 minutes, No excuses. I have never waited 1.5 hours for an oil change, and I have never seen such a level of incompetence when it comes to getting a basic question answered. Even Jiffy lube is quicker and cheaper and they do far more than an oil change.  I would not recommend these people to put air in my tires. The next time I will drive to Johnson Ford in Temple, really any dealership would be better than Automax Ford. I have read many reviews about this company, most are not good. One thing is certain, the only reason these people have stayed in business is because this is a "" Military town"",  our soldiers come and go every day and  unlike most places Automax will always have new customers that are unfamiliar with their poor service.  Some of the reviews even indicate poor and unethical sales tactics by this dealership. Please if you need a new car, used care or service, find another place that will treat you properly, and will earn your business.. ",1.2
160,"September 30, 2015",Bought a car in April 14 and sent a friend in November 14 he gave the salesman my information for the 200 dollar referral fee and after contacting the dealership several times I figured they needed the $200 more than I did . Mac Haik stands behind there referral program . Automax not so much . I'll never buy another car from Automax .,3.0
161,"July 14, 2015","I bought a 2014 Ford Fiesta three months ago. We soon noticed that the driver side front tire had a slow leak, but we had things to do, so we just made sure the tire was aired up. Yesterday, I called the Automax Service Center to schedule the tire to be looked at. I called in the morning, but was told someone would call me back shortly. I waited until 4 p.m., then called them again. They said someone would call me - which did not happen.

This morning (Tuesday) I called them again. They put me on hold for about 5-6 minutes then I got disconnected. I called back immediately, and was on hold for about 10 minutes, after which I hung up and called back. I explained to the operator that I have been trying to get in touch with the Service department for two days and I wanted to know why I could not get a simple tire fixed, and she replied with a crappy attitude, very snippy, ""I don't work in the service department,"" after which I hung up. 

I spent thousands of dollars for a car, but when I need them to do a repair for a few dollars I can't get any assistance. If I need warranty work done, I will go to another Ford dealership.

162,"June 25, 2015",i took my expedition over two weeks to get the brakes checked before going cross country.  My steering wheel and back brakes were still shaking.  Got a local mechanic to look at it and had no back brakes and rotate needed to be turned!  Thank God we were not in an accident!,2.2
163,"May 09, 2015","I came in for my one free oil change @ 8 and still sitting here at 9. I made an appointment. What's the point if you don't get service from when you bring it in. Ill reiterated,  I only came for an oil change. I just want to go home. ",2.4

165,"February 16, 2015","Bought a vehicle for over $30,000 within 2 months it starts falling apart. I'm stuck now paying for the $3,000 plus for repairs. All they can say is it's not in their policy. The salesmen are unprofessional and dishonest. Actually had one stop talking to me in the middle of a conversation to check out a female coworker. Save yourself the time and headache.

166,"May 09, 2014","As you may see my other review on here. I was called in to Automax today to discuss things with the finance advisor Brandon Ming. Let me just say that Brandon did everything in his power to allow me to drive away in my new 2014 Hyundai Sonata, trading in my 2013 Ford Fiesta. Terrence Wade was my sales advisor, he is wonderful, if you are looking for a new car, anything is possible with Terrence I promise, and Jamie Gentles which is the finance department, is also wonderful, he handled all of my paperwork with care, made sure that I fully understood everything before I signed the paper work. I am pleased with Automax, this is my third car buying from them. Thank you Automax!",5.0
167,"May 02, 2014","I am a 20 year old female, residing in Killeen, Texas. My father is currently in the Armed Forces, and is living in Hawaii with my mother. My mother and father purchased a used 2009 silver Cobalt from Automax in Killeen, Texas. After having the car for about two years, I went and purchased a 2013 New Ford Fiesta, lime squeeze in color. I purchased the car in March of 2013. The Fiesta started having troubles, with the transmission, which should never occur on a new car. I had repeatedly told Automax about the issue, as they continued to shove my issue to the side, stating that Ford has placed new shifters in all of the vehicles. As I am driving my car, with my three year old son, I stalled out in the middle of a four-way intersection. I immediately take the car in to Automax, for them to find something wrong with the car, as I initially suggested. They had to order four different parts for the Fiesta. I ordered the parts in January it is now May, and I receive a phone call in late April stating that my parts had finally arrived. That's three months I had to wait, with no replacement car given, so I am still driving the fiesta with my child inside, and have to navigate to and from to Austin, Texas about an hour away to school. So I finally had enough and went to Automax to see if they could put me in a new car, I was tired of the hassle, After being turned away multiple times, someone finally decided to help me. I was able to purchase a 2014 New Hyundai Sonata. So, after two weeks of driving the new car, I get a phone call to come in to Automax to finalize paperwork before they send the documents to my mother in Hawaii to co-sign. I had already signed the buyers agreement with Automax. When I went in to Automax after driving the new car for two weeks, my interest rate, and monthly payment had changed drastically. I no longer agreed to purchase the vehicle, and neither did my mother, so I end up getting the Fiesta back. The fiesta had not been touched, still had not been fixed, I now have to take the car back down to Automax on Tuesday May the 6th to get the parts put on. This is my only vehicle to get around in. I put 500.00 down towards the new car, I am now requesting my money back on a car that I am no longer driving, I am getting the run around to receive this money back, and still have yet to receive it. I had a loan through Wells Fargo for the Fiesta. Automax never paid off the Fiesta, so payments added up as well as late fees, so a 387.64 payment went to a 420.00 payment, on top of another 387.64 payment, which of course I had to pay. My mother and I were in danger of being turned in to a collections agency, which is not out fault. We have made every single payment on time, my mother's credit is excellent, while I am still building mine, and she was in danger of having her credit dropped dramatically. Automax failed to contact Wells Fargo for their mistake. I am not happy with Automax at all. I also referred a customer to them, which was a mistake, and was due to receive 200.00 for the referral within weeks, I did not receive that until three months after the referral, since they lost all of my paperwork. I also requested that the GAP insurance be cancelled on the Fiesta, they lost the paperwork for that, good thing I had a personal copy. I submitted that in August, and didn't get it refunded until about February. I would never refer another friend or family member to Automax in Killeen, Texas. I may be 20 years old, but I am no fool. My father is military and will be getting higher authorities involved. Automax had their license suspended from selling to military, and has recently gained it back. I have not met one employee in that building that has worked with me, that has been the slight bit of friendly, and caring. They do not care about anything, but the money. They are selling vehicles in conditions that should not be sold in. I am very disappointed and never want to associate, or work with Automax again. I feel that this issue needs to be heard, and known so it does not happen to anyone else.",1.0
168,"April 18, 2014","I ordered some part first of April.  I was told then one price but when the order was complete the price was way higher. Was told they would take less then a week - as of today April 18 they are still not in.  I was very clear and asked three or more times if this did not work could I return them for a full refund.  Yes was the answer three times.  Called today to see where they were and to cancel the order.  
Spend the day waiting for a return call.  I call back had trouble taking to a manager finally did and he needed to get the refund approved (What kind of manager is that?)  Have not heard back so will call the credit company tomorrow to see if I can stop payment on the credit card.  ",2.2
169,"March 06, 2014","At 9:00 AM I brought my F-150 in for an oil change and inspection sticker. I was told that it would take 2 hours, ( this is express service).   I waited in the waiting area, where they have a flat screen TV right next to the Cashier's counter. The TV had on ESPN, well I am not into sports and I was the only person sitting there, so I asked the cashier to turn the channel to CNN or Fox news, and she told me no. I asked her why she couldn't honor my request and she said the Owner's rules, I asked was the owner watching the TV, and indicated it was a stupid rule. Keep in mind, if there were others watching this TV I would not have made my request. If the TV is for the customer's benefit, then why not allow a customer who is there spending their money the ability to change the channel. Not everyone likes sports. This is just  Poor Customer relations. While waiting on my truck, the service tech, informed me that I needed new wiper blades to pass inspection, I said there is nothing wrong with my wipers I just used them this morning. I didn't want Ford blades because they don't last very long. He indicated If they didn't put the blades on the vehicle,  I would have to come back for re-inspection. I told them to replace the blades, knowing there was noting wrong with them. He later came back and said he misunderstood the inspector, that the blades pass inspection but that they should be replace due to some minor wear.  The service as complete  1 hour and 45 minutes later, really not the amount of time I would expect to wait for an oil change and inspection. About a week later  I get a call from them and instead of wanting to know how was the service, they try to convince me bring in my 2010 F-150 for trade because it only has 25000 miles and they need good used cars. I told the guy on the phone, If I wanted a new vehicle, I would have bought one before and hung up the phone.... I don't think I will be doing business with these guys any time soon.. as a customer I just felt as if  I was an interruption to their day. ",2.0

Ive called several times and all they can tell me is that they are still trying to get finacing on the Truck we bought, the truck we have been driving for 2 months!!!!!

171,"December 02, 2013","I brought my vehicle into the service department at 10:30 am for an oil change and I needed the air conditioner checked because it was making a popping noise. The service rep explained he would contact my warranty for coverage. He did not explain there would be a $100 diagnosis fee. He wrote a number on a piece of paper and asked me to initial. I asked what it was and I said, ""is this the price for the part?"" (Btw all of the staff in the office were talking about this part that likely needed to be replaced. They said it was a common problem.) He answered ""yes"" to my question.  I wasn't concerned because I had a warranty to cover it. I had a ride pick me up and informed the rep that I needed to pick my car up before 2:00 so I could get my child from school. He was very reassuring he would update me throughout the day on progress. At 1:00 pm I had not heard from him so I called and spoke with another rep. This man told me my rep was on the phone and would promptly call me back as soon as he hung up. No call back. So at 2:00 I showed up and he says, ""Didn't you get my message?"" I said no I had not and double checked my cell. No call. No message. Then he proceeded to read my number back to me. Totally wrong number on that paper he had hand written. My correct number was in print on every other document. Anyways he told me that my warranty did not cover this specific part and quoted me a price of $350 to pay myself. I said no not right now we will have to come back. He got my vehicle out 45 minutes later and showed me my bill $156 for an oil change and this DIAGNOSIS FEE. I asked what is this fee. He showed me where I initialed and explained the fee is due since I didn't get the work done. I asked to speak to a manager. Meanwhile unable to pick up my daughter by this time my husband had to leave work to get her. The service manager took me into his office and immediately started talking. It was just a bunch of sugar coated lines about how great their customer service is and how it's their goal to make me happy. He probably says this same speech 20 times a day. I know because I had heard him tell another disgruntled customer the same things 20 minutes prior out in the waiting room. So all Tim would offer is to reduce the fee by half. Well I had to pay it unless I wanted I walk home carrying my 1 year old. Bottom line the service rep DID NOT EXPLAIN THE FEE and GAVE ME THE WRONG ANSWER WHEN I DIRECTLY QUESTIONED HIM ON IT! My phone calls went unanswered, unreturned, and when he did try to call me he wasn't even competent enough to dial the right number. Plus I wasn't there to pick up my daughter from school. Automax doesn't care about ratings or customer service. They have people coming through there like cattle. As long as they make money from monopolizing the area and taking advantage of soldiers they DONT CARE. ",1.4
172,"October 24, 2013","Service Dept. STINKS!! Walter, Tony, Javi and Ivan are there not to help but to accuse you of dinging your car. When it was not there when it was brought in for service. The techs will step on car pieces (dashboards) and snap it. However, they do not let the customer know and put it back together with glue. I noticed it when I was cleaning my car that day. The second incident was the dash again and they used one screw to hold it in place. When I opened the glove compartment the whole dash fell. It does not matter if you are a Ford, VW or Hyundai....service still is AWFUL!!! Techs are a bunch of incompetents! Not returning and I have been patient and have given them several chances! Stay away, you will be better off going to Johnson Ford, Mak Haik or Roger Beaseley. You may have to travel a little but worth your time.

174,"June 07, 2013","I went to AutoMax to kill some time one day and was greeted by a very friendly staff.  I dealt with Marco Saenz and Gi Choe.  Both of them were very helpful and knowledgeable on their lineup of cars.  Not only did they go above and beyond with their willingness to get me to the price I was looking for, they gave me a great price on my trade in.  It was a nice change to have a car salesman break the stereotype of being pushy.  They made sure that I got the exact car that I wanted at a more then fair price.  There were more than a few times when they asked if I was sure that the truck I was looking at was exactly what I wanted.  It was obvious that they truly cared about me being happy with what I bought, and that they were not just trying to get a sale.  Bobby, the finance manager, was helpful in trying to get us the best rate that he could.  We ended up going with our own credit union, and he was more than understanding with that and did not try to push us to use theirs.

After the deal was done, I received my keys and 'freshly detailed' new vehicle which had streaks all over it and could barely see out of the windshield.

If you're a disabled vet, you get 'below invoice' pricing, but the owner still makes around 10 grand on the deal!!!? After numerous calls and complaints, I'm told all of this is due to their large sales volume. If you can't support the sales volume, then the manager/owner should increase the staff. It's actually a means of monopolizing your money as long as possible and retaining interest as long as possible. The customer ends up getting late payment notices on the trade they traded over 30 days prior. Of course the response is it's their policy.
