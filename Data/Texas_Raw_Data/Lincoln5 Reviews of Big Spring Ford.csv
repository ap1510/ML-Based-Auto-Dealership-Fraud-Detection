0,"January 09, 2020","I was told today for my car to be LOOKED AT for the transmission, it would take 6 weeks. Told them that was fine, I would reserve for that. They said instead I would need to LEAVE THE CAR THERE FOR SIX WEEKS. 

To get an estimate. 

I know not every, or even most, cars are having to wait that long to be looked at. They are trying to avoid honoring a Ford warranty. Dishonest. 

I thought about doing it but taking photos of the cars in queue when I arrived, so I could see how many cars were going in first, but not worth my time. ",1.0
1,"January 15, 2019",This dealership overall is terrible experience but the service dept is even worse. They are so busy yet won’t expand. Lies from employees will leave you spinning your wheels that are literally in their service shop for weeks to months at a time. They beg you to leave reviews once you purchase from them which is fine until the deal is closed and you realize just how bad it’s all been. ,1.6
2,"November 11, 2017","Service dept is in apt; replaced brake line on front and then tell I have alignment issue, had argue with tech to get him bleed the brakes again. Rebuild ignition switch and then had go back twice because remote start didn’t work and then the gear selector was out of position it read reverse when in park and 1 when drive! Avoid this place like it is the plague!",1.4
3,"October 11, 2016","They are so unorganized here. They will utterly & completely rip you off just to do it. They will not give u a good deal even though they tell you they are. They lie consistently about everything. They are as crooked as it gets. I filed a case on the BBB website, that's how horrible I was treated by this dealership. Do not go here. I know there is not much opportunity in big springs, Texas to buy cars, but I promise you if you go here, it will be the biggest mistake of your life. ",1.0
4,"July 24, 2015","Service was unperfessional and my vehicle would no longer start after they installed a new clutch! Getting info from them is impossible as well. I was charge 4,400.00 for the service only to have my great running vehicle not run anymore and said to be bad batteries, THEY WERE BRAND NEW BATTERIES WHEN IT WENT IN! NEVER GO THERE. I bought a car from them while my pickup was being worked on, that was an OK experience!",1.8
