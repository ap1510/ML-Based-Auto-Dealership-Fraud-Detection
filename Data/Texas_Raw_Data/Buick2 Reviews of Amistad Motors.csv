0,"April 30, 2019","AC blew hot so I scheduled an online appt.  After waiting long for three people to tell me I needed to see someone else, I found the service department. Desoite my online appt made two days in advance, I was informed they are not able to access it online and, therefore, had no record of me and that I should have called.  Plus there is a sign posted next to the service desk which stated it was only ""fair"" those first in lineget serviced first and not to expect repairs performed on the same day.  Seemed anattemot to rationalize poor service and to make customers happy for it.  Nevermind plenty of 
staff around to fix things asao.  I thought it odd there were three cars in the service bay and two were very old non-gm models. I speculate those were project cars the staff worked on during work hours and explains the long service 
times.  Needless to say I left.  Nobody there was pleased a paying customer walked in, and think they were happy I left.  For those who live i. Ft. Stockton and want genuine gm service, I suggest you move away.",1.0
