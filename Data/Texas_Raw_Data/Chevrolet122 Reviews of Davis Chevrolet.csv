She was extremely helpful.

3,"March 07, 2020","First and last time here. Dropped off my car on Friday morning and told them would just pick it up on sat first thing. Had to get a key reprogrammed and was told wouldn’t be ready till Monday. No problem. Show up on sat am and check in the service guy and he says the fob was here and needed to be programmed. He said would take 20m and I told him absolutely not. I’m in a rush. I go in to pay and wait for my car. Lo and behold the garage had already started whatever programming and ‘can’t be stopped once it’s started’. Was told would be 20m tops. 40m later the head of the garage tells me that whoops! Needs more software updating and will take yet another 15m. Even tho I told them I wanted to pick up the car and go on Saturday and esp after telling them to not do the fob bc I was in a rush and had an appt they still fcked me over. Missed my appt and too bad for me. Like I said, first and last time",1.0

14,"June 16, 2019","I had looked at a few dealerships, but came back to this one for the better price. Mark Bayonetta was the salesman and he did such a wonderful job helping me find what I want. He was very up front with the cost of each vehicle and the different addons. He was also extremely patient when we needed to step aside and have some private conversations. I feel like we got the best price we could for that vehicle and the process was pretty painless. Mark was great to work with and I'd recommend anyone to go to that dealership and talk with him.",5.0

17,"September 08, 2018","It's time for me to switch dealership that services my car. Location is convenient but it's always something not done, misinformation or incomplete.",2.8
18,"September 05, 2018","I purchased my 2014 Cruz from this dealership had no problems in the beginning took it back to dealership for service oil changes and inspections long wait even with appointments but tried to show my customer loyalty with them. On Friday, I took my car without an appointment because it was hesitating in starting waited for over two hours nothing, so I left and came back two hours later and they still had not look at the car it had just been sitting in the back, water on the car from rain was the indication. So I took my car and left. Got up on Sunday morning to go to church and the car would not say anything. Monday was a holiday and the service department was closed, got to the dealership around seven thirty on Tuesday and it still took them an hour and a half before they came to tell me what was wrong with my car. So add the hours for diagnostics four hours Friday and an hour and a half Tuesday if my math is correct five and a half hours to tell me the battery was bad and one of the cables needed replacing. Now the battery that came with the car quit working about a year and a half after I purchased the car and they replaced it with no charge, so you would think the replaced batter had at least three years of battery life on a car that has less than seven thousand miles on it, well it didn't. I was told it was two years and five months since the battery was replaced and I would have to purchase a new battery and cable and with labor the cost would be $300.00. The time the car spent sitting on their lot should have cover labor fees, however, with the frustrations already feed up with such poor customer service on Tuesday morning I got out the car to vent to the service manager he ask for the keys and I left my coin purse under the drivers seat of the car not thinking and gave him the keys. After finding out the cost of the repair and mind you I did have to return the car after the first battery replacement I just wanted to get it fixed and get out of there never to return there for repair service again. When I refused the service and they brought my car out to me prior to that I did remember I left my coin purse under the seat I immediately before even getting in the car looked to see if the purse was still there and it was nowhere to be found. I talk with the service manager and the tech that waited on me on Friday and nothing was resolved nor did my purse ever surface. I would never recommend that anyone ever go there for car service for the way they display poor quality of customer service and their thieving employees. Chuck Davis has gone to the DOGS!",1.0

21,"July 22, 2018","I bought my new truck at Davis Chevrolet a couple months ago and I just went in today for the first oil change, it took them over 2 hours to have my truck ready.

28,"June 05, 2018","I purchased a used car less than a week ago and it is making a popping sound. When I asked to have this fixed at no charge to me I was told that I have to pay $100 deductible to have the issue fixed because the car was serviced to be “SAFE” not for noises. I took to my mechanic and was told the CV Joints need to be replaced soon because the broken joints could cause the axel to break. Doesn’t sound safe to me!

42,"March 29, 2018","I just cannot stop telling everyone’about my experience at Davis Chevrolet especially those that warned me what a hassle and a lot of haggling it would be. 
Jose aimed to please. After showing my disappointment with the first vehicle that did not have the features I wanted, Jose kept saying that he was going to find me something. To my surprise he did find the perfect car and he let me walk out of that dealership in my brand new car. I thought I was dreaming. I could not believe I was driving my brand knew car.
I had calls from at least six dealers however I was really liked the idea of Shellie calling to set up everything and the fact that Tommie wanted to say hello to me over the phone and meet me. Wow what treatment. 
I’ve gotta tell you though, Jose did not make a first good empress ion. I’m thinking this guy takes me out in the cold humid windy air and shows me a car with the most important features missing.  Once back at his office, we started talking and he learned more about me and what I had in mind. He then goes to work to find me a car. Everyone made me feel like there was a team working together to get what I wanted   Together they made it happen.
The selling starts after the first no and Jose has that spot on. 
I really liked Juan. He was telling everyone’ my birth year was 1974. He was sure that that was the year even when the creditor question him. No it’s 1974 he says. What a guy. He made me 30 years younger 
Overall I am very pleased with my experience with everyone at Davis Chevrolet. My heartfelt thanks to everyone. ",5.0

51,"December 29, 2017","I purchased my 2017 Silverado extended cab on August on the last week immediately after the hurricane Harvey storm. During the deal I was promised to receive a spray in bed liner and was told to simply contact my sales person (Jamail) when ready so it can be scheduled and during this time I would also get a loaner vehicle. In September 2017 I called the receptionist in the sales department and she transferred my call to Jamail where I left a message however several days passed without a call back). Since my work requires a great deal of driving, my first oil change approached and it needed it so I scheduled it also Monday October 2nd at 8am. For my first oil change, I scheduled it online (received an email confirmation of my exact request) and it had a comment section where I indicated specifically I wanted the spray in bed liner  to be done as well. I assumed that naturally since I didn't have any luck with a call back from my sales guy this would most certainly be noticed and proceeded to go to my appointment on the date scheduled. I arrived to my appointment early in the morning and thus informed the greeter, letting him know the reason of my appointment: oil change and spray in bed liner, showed him the ""we owe you"" document I received during my purchase and he took it with him. I mentioned I was told of the loaner vehicle i was promised. He said that this is something he would check on and asked me to wait in waiting area so I did. Almost three hours passed and finally I was called to get my vehicle and was told I needed to speak to the service manager Sean who will tell me about the status on the bed liner. I waited some more time to speak to the manager who said that oil change was done however no bed liner as this is needed to be scheduled by the sales person who sold me the vehicle. No apology was offered even once by any of the people who spoke with me neither was my ""we owe you"" document returned other than what showed on my oil change receipt. It is now the end of the year and still I have had no luck in getting my sales person to call me back neither getting a sales manager to return my calls that I have left. I can understand that perhaps the sales person is no longer employed there and thus no call back however when even the receptionist transfers your call to the sales person you mention and transfers the call to the sales manager Tom Pearson, one would assume that at least a call would be returned by somebody. Alas this is not the case at all. ",2.0
52,"October 11, 2017",I just recently took my truck in for service the guys there did a great job.

I am very appreciative for their help and support. Thanks a bunch.,5.0

63,"December 25, 2015","After coming from another state to buy a 2015 Tahoe . The dealership employee who changed the grille on the Tahoe scratched and had gashes on my front bumber, driver's side handle and piece below the bumper. I was told by the salesperson to get estimates from my local body shop and dealers to have the damaged fixed. After getting two estimates the damages totaled over $700 dollars. The sales managers of new car sales decided to try to force me to put over 600 miles on my new Tahoe and drive 6 plus hours to get it done at their dealership, I was told them having to pay someone else to do it ""cut into their profit"" I explained numerous times that because of a medical condition it was impossible to drive back to Houston. Due to the fact that I lived out of state to pay for the damages that one of their employees did on my new vehicle. I thought because I had spent so much money and hoped that they put the needs of their customer first before greed over profit they would agree to having the damages repaired at my local dealer\body shop but the refused. Then after days of going back and forth they agreed to ONLY pay $300 instead of the $700 and didn't care that I would of had to pay the remainder of the cost out of my own pocket ! They damage my new Tahoe and want me to pay ...how's that for being concerned with customer satisfaction!",1.0
64,"December 01, 2015","My Sales Rep was Mr. Melvin Jones who was very cordial and very friendly, he was easy to communicate with. Very knowledgeable in his field.  On the other hand he was kind of slow in my opinion in handling my purchase, because I had work going on at my house and family coming in for the holidays.  But it worked out for the good, because his slowness help me think about more questions I had to ask, which made my purchase go so smoothly.  So if you are looking for someone who will take their time with you , Melvin's your man.

65,"October 31, 2015","Went in for a 2015 Chevy Volt. Steve was very nice at first over the phone and the test drive until we got to his desk. I had done all my research and knew what all the costs would be based on hundreds of current volt owners and numbers provided directly by Chevy. Steve started bringing in additional fees, charges and prices that were outrageous after we got to his desk. After going back and forth discussing the origin of all these extra costs and numbers that didn't match with advertised prices or chevy's website he brought in his manager to ""clarify things"". His manager QUICKLY killed off any remaining possibility of closing a deal. He was extremely rude and condescending towards myself and my girlfriend. I absolutely will not purchase a vehicle from this dealership and because of this horrid experience it has left a bad taste in my mouth with Chevy. I will strongly advise any friends or family to stay far away as well. I hope everyone reading this heeds my warning and that of others, stay far far away from Davis Chevrolet.

67,"July 31, 2014","I spoke to someone over the phone and they suggested that I make an appointment since my door locks had not been working properly.  I ended up scheduling an appointment for Wednesday, so I dropped my vehicle off early that morning.  As the day went by I at least thought that I would have received a phone call letting me know what was going on with my vehicle.  Later that evening I went up there just to get my child's car seat and it took about 15-20 minutes for me to get someone to help me with that.  I understand it was busy at that time, but you should at least acknowledge your customers instead of constantly just walking by saying nothing.  Another 2 days went by and I never received a phone call letting me know that status of my vehicle, oh and I'm still without a vehicle and it has been almost a week now. This type of service is ridiculous and a real inconvenience.",1.2
68,"July 09, 2014","I will start by saying that Davis Chevy's Customer Service on the front end of the relationship of purchasing a car meets and exceeds the type of customer service you would expect.  On the back end when you take your car in to the service department you do a complete 180.   So in regards to the question of would I recommend this dealer, I would say yes for Sales; no for Service.  

Thankfully I've only had to use service three times since I bought this vehicle.  Twice for oil changes, and once for a state inspection.  They get you to come back to the service department after you buy the vehicle by giving you special customer pricing, plus I'm a loyal GM Customer, so I'm going to support GM. .  For my two oil changes I went in on Saturday's and I knew I was going to have to wait, but I was prepared for it, didn't have anything else to do.  I will say the waits that I have had at this dealership are not my typically experience at other dealerships with my last vehicle. 

For my state inspection I made an appointment on a Monday for that Friday, because I wasn't able to get in on the weekend, so I planned ahead and scheduled an appointment.  I thought with the appointment I would be the next person in a bay but come to find out that's not the case.  Thinking I would be able to get in and out of there at lunch was stupid on my part.  It took them two hours to have the inspection completed .  Don't get me wrong I could have gotten it done at any corner shop, but I'm a loyal GM customer I support GM.  My thinking on this also was they have been the only ones to touch the vehicle, that's the way I want to keep it.  If something's wrong it's still under warranty, they are going to fix it.  

So I'm not one to sit quietly back so I speak up when the wait has gotten ridiculous, (should of spoke up sooner) and the response is oh it's ready, we will get you going right away. (Get the pissed off customer out of here fast, so other customers don't see or hear her).  So the next steps to me speaking up are as follows: 

1. Submitting an e-mail via their website,  their response let us sell you a new vehicle, they don't even take time to read the e-mail they receive they just try to sell you another one.   

2. Left a voice mail for Matt Davis (who was on vacation at the time), never received a call back.  I waited three days from the date he was supposed to return according to his voice mail, before I proceed with #4. (So disappointed in you Matt, when we saw you on the sales floor while we were buying the car, you looked so much more involved with your customer's happiness). 

3. In the meantime I received a survey via e-mail from the dealership asking how they did, answered honestly, the automatic response was someone will be contacting you, but in the mean time please feel free to tell GM how we did when you receive the corporate survey.  (I think they were trying to make sure the corporate survey's only went to people who had a positive response).  Never heard back from them. 

4. Had a nice little chat with GM Dealer Relations (Corporate) letting them know my experience, they forwarded my info to Tom Pearson's, and I did get a call back within an hour.  But it was more of a call to say hey I called you, I listened to what you had to say, I did what was expected of me.  Sorry Tom that's not how the conversation should have gone down.  Don't blame it on recalls or this or that. I've had my vehicle serviced before recalls and received similar levels of customer service. (You knew four days in advance you were going to have a customer in for this type of appointment, you should have been staffed appropriately.) 

At this point in time I've left it with #4 in dealing with Davis.  I'm waiting for GM Dealer Relations to call me back to follow up on this situation and I'll tell them how I feel with the way Tom handled it. 

Trust me Davis, I'm not going to let this rest until I feel this situation has been addressed appropriately, to not even care about my experience is bad business on your end.

69,"October 16, 2013","I recently purchased my 2013 suburban from Davis Cheverolet. I wanted to let everyone know what a positive experience I had with my salesmen Juan O.. He made my purchase transaction very smooth and stressless. He kept great communication with me via email through the whole process. He helped me look for discounts and incentives which I might qualified for so I could to get to the price I wanted to spend. He put 100% effort in getting me in and out of the dealership with my new vehicle purchase, but yet he took time to go over the important facts about the vehicle.

70,"July 26, 2013","My Chevy truck does not start sometimes so I took it to Davis Chevrolet to have it repaired.  After checking my truck in Mark explained to me they charge $118.00 to look at the truck and then they charge $10.00 for shop supplies that will be needed to look at my truck.  Afraid of getting stranded I left my truck with them.  A few hours later Mark called and told me that they were stumped and couldn't do anything about the starting problem.  I asked him to replace with windshield washer container and I would come get my truck.  Total bill,  $328.00! And my truck is stuck in the drive way with a very clean windshield.  ",2.0

I asked him to confirm the details via email, which he did.  When I showed up to actually purchase the vehicle, the sales person told me there had been a mistake and I would have to $750 more.  When I refused, he offered to split the difference.  I again refused, and he then agreed to honor the original deal.

The first time he wrote it up, he added an additional $270 to the bottom line.  When I pointed out the mistake, he ""apologized for the mistake"", and went back (again) to the original offer.  These people are not honest, and I would not recommend them.  I eventually did purchase the vehicle, and for the originally offered price, but they SILL owe me the 2nd set of keys.",3.3

74,"July 31, 2012","I wanted to replace my 2003 Chevy Avalanche with a new (2012) one, and upgrade to 4WD while I was at it.  I didn't find a lot of inventory fitting my needs anywhere by searching the Internet, but Martin Downey at Davis Chevrolet found me a virtually perfect match for my specifications immediately.  The car had to be brought in from the Dallas area, but Martin and Chris (sorry, didn't catch his last name) kept me informed through the entire process.  The car showed up in the agreed-upon time frame, and Martin did a great job of walking me through the vehicle's features.  He preregistered OnStar for me, saving me a lot of time talking to those folks when I picked up the car.  He even caught the fact that I'd left CD's and heavy-duty mats in the trade-in!

This was the best experience I've had buying a car in a long, long time.  Hats off to Davis Chevrolet and Martin Downey in particular for a really great experience!  I recommend the dealership, and especially Martin, without reservation.

 I spent a week getting to gather financing for the 05 king ranch they have. I have an email from Jamie stating that they would give me $5000 for my truck. I get everything done that I need to to make this happen. I rented a trailer for $145. Took off of work. Spent about $250 in gas. Did ALL this to drive up there and have them screw me!! They offered me $3000 for the truck. Obviously I was pretty PO'd. I was already approved for the loan on the truck. Bank already had the Vin number and everything was ready to go. All they had to do to make the sale was give me what they had told me.

 That's how they took care of me!!!

 I wasted my money and my time for nothing!!! Thanks Davis Chevrolet!!! Thanks Jamie!! thanks Used car Manager!! I will make sure never to do business with you guys and make sure everyone I know never does either!!

He  took me to another car and I drove it, but I was SOLDED on the first one. we went back inside and started making a deal. I had checkout what my tahoe should bring as a trade in and he came up in the middle of the range, which was what I thought would happen. I was fine with that. We worked on the trade in price, my down payment and the intrest rate.

On March 15th, I received a call from some lucky guy named Steve Engbrock, who told me that my Corvette was delivered and it would take two days to complete the dealer prep. On St. Patrick's Day, Steve called and said ""the car is ready, when do you want to pick it up?"" I had a problem arranging for someome to drop me off at Davis, so I called Steve and asked him if he would pick me up and he did. This was my first meeting with Steve.
