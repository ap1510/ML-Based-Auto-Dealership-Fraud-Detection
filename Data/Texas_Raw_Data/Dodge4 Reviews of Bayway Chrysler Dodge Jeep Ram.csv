0,"May 15, 2020","I take fault for my own actions as I should have not trusted what the finance manager was telling me and reviewed Every Detail line by line. He added in a $795.00 line item for GPS tracking that he told me would be free. I had declined it completely and he came back and said that he would throw it in for FREE because he wanted to get a good rating on my review. Well guess what. He lied about this completely, and on top of that he did not tell me he was adding in $299.00 for window vin etching. The total amount they added in on top of the agreed price was $1094. If you buy from this dealer, I do not recommend, take your time and check every line no matter what they are telling you. I trust people to be honest, not these guys.",1.0
1,"February 28, 2020","bait and switch! saw an ad on 3 websites for a jeep. price was $46640. i called to verify availability. took off from work, drove an hour. sat for 2 hours waiting and instead was shown a  different jeep for $59500. james and javier stated that they made a mistake and could not honor that price because autotrader was responsible, even though their own webpage had the same price of 46640. keegan was my salesperson and was nice. keegan tried to explain the situation but ultimatley they could only offer me that jeep for 53000. they wasted a total of 4 hours of my time. stay away! i have screenshots of everything, never saw the vehicle i was there for, that keegan verified was there and even texted me a photo of it.",1.0

3,"April 10, 2019","Called ahead to confirm vehicle availability and internet price, arrived preapproved. Test drove the exact advertised vehicle and tried to purchase for the price agreed to over the phone (and listed on the website). Dealer wanted msrp (which was $8k more), stated they could not meet the advertised price because it was incorrect. This price is still advertised for 4 of their vehicles (same make and model), they're using bait and switch to get people into the dealership. 

What was also very odd was that everytime the salesman came back from 'talking with the manager' the price went UP(!?) the first time we thought it was a mistake. 

We arrived preapproved, excellent credit and a willingness to purchase on the spot, also this particular car is a new 2018 that has been on the lot for over 181 days, what were they waiting for?",1.4
