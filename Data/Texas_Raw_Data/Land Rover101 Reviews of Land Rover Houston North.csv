0,"May 18, 2020","What a joke of a dealership. SALES Manager texted that the new Defender would be in the showroom in 30 minutes. We came to the showroom an hour and a half later, no Defender and the sales Mangler would not show his face. Left word for the General Manager to contact us. No response. Trust me, we will spend our dollars elsewhere. ",2.0
1,"April 06, 2020",Excellent service from Jason Lacher and Donna Watkins at Land Rover Houston North. Door to door VIP service from test driving several cars to servicing our other car. We have purchased many Range Rovers and I would definitely go back to this dealership to purchase my next Range Rover. ,5.0
2,"February 19, 2020","We purchased our 2012 Range Rover Sport from this dealership and have had excellent service each and every time the vehicle has had to go in for a service or repairs.  Al is our service coordinator and he has always been courteous, efficient and gone above and beyond to help with any issues we have had with the vehicle.  We fully intend purchasing another Land Rover.   Present vehicle now at 110,000 miles and running well.",5.0
3,"May 28, 2018","My husband and I just left this dealership. Not only did we not purchase the vehicle we went looking for, no one even acknowledged us. We sat in 3 different vehicles and not one salesperson asked if we were being helped. I  was so disappointed that I told my husband that I was ready to leave. Customer service is terrible!!! I received better service at Car Max. As a matter of fact, 'VIC', a young man that works in the back, offered more assistance than the salesperson. ",1.6
4,"March 20, 2018","Immediately after purchase a used Volvo, my air conditioner did not work.  This was repaired after 4 to 5 visits, and only after taking to Volvo for service.  Now, after less than 9,000 miles driven, the brakes squeak and must be replaced.  Why?  Because the dealership installed ""off market"" brake pads and rotors, not Volvo parts.  The dealership has refused to credit for either parts or labor by Volvo service.  I suggest anyone who is considering service for a car, not Jaguar or Land Rover, go to another dealership service department.   ",2.2
5,"May 12, 2017",We have bought 3 range rovers from this dealership. Sales side is good to work with. The service side is the absolute worst. We will not be buying or servicing another vehicle from them again. We were made to feel like it was our fault that there were recalls. Every one is extremely rude and has no idea how to treat a customer that has spent well over 300k ,1.0
6,"September 23, 2014","On the sales side they were friendly and did go out of their way to sell us the car we wanted.  But that is when the nightmare started.
We have not had a single service visit that didn't take at least one follow up visit.  A good example is the last one about 3 weeks ago. We took our Evoque in for an $800 service.  Within 3 days the service engine light comes on.  To get that fixed it has to be at the dealerships convenience. We are waiting on a call back from the service manager.  But from previous experience he will never call back.  Not the first time this has happened.
On a previous problem, I was even on a conference call with the Service Manager, Sale Manager, etc.  They promised to look into the problem.  I sent them the service records and never heard back. This bad experience goes on and on.
Do not by your Jag or Land Rover from this dealership. ",1.4
7,"July 26, 2014","Went in to purchase a new RRS HSE.  They tried to convince me my trade-in was worth $7K less than Kelly Blue Book trade in value.  Would not negotiate at all on either the new Range Rover Sport (I understand, the RRS's are hot sellers right now) or the trade in, saying it would take $7000 to make my 5 year old car ""like new"".   Sold my car to CarMax the next day outright for $6,000 more than their offer.   That's right.....$6,000 (25%) more! Their explanations were completely nonsensical (""well, we have to buy new wheels for over $1000 each"", etc.).  Guess they never heard about reconditioning wheels.  Most dealers would buy the car, then wholesale it if they did not want to sell it, Surprised they can stay in business.  Since I felt they were trying to rip me off, they won't get any of mine.",1.3
8,"March 12, 2014",What a treat. Even with the construction we felt well taken care of. Sorry BMW. Definitely top recommendation. We will be back for future purchases,4.5
9,"October 31, 2013","I ordered 2 Full size Range Rover HSE a couple of months back with $5K total deposit paid on the spot. Today I got a phone call from a manger at Land Rover Houston North accusing me of exporting the Rovers overseas. He started by asking me how much I make, what kind of car I am driving and talked to me like I couldn’t afford one. I felt very insulted! They treated me like I was a second class citizen! Despite my waiting time and my $5k being held for several months with no interest paid, they just have no right to treat anyone like this! 
 If Land Rover does not want my money, I am glad to take my hard earned money somewhere else. It is that simple. I will never return to any Land Rover dealership, nor spend a dime on Land Rover product. They are just Horrible!

10,"May 28, 2013","Everyone says go to the North Store. We have been servicing our Jag for years at the other two locations in Houston. After suffering through all the games while trying to purchase a new LR4, we finally took their advice. What a difference! Adam was straightforward, no games, and sent us home happy with a new car. We now service both vehicles here as we'll. ",5.0
11,"April 17, 2013","Worst landrover dealership for both sales and service. We live in The Woodlands so this is closest to us. First tried to buy a new LR4 but they said silver was hard to find. We went home did quick Internet search and found it in Dallas and drove 3 hrs to pick up. Next month tried to buy a new range rover for my husband but sales manager was awful and playing games with financing like we are idiots so he purchased his car next day from Katy dealership. I tried to have LR4 serviced at this location and same circus. 1 1/2 days in servicing with dirty loaner car just to get out to find item they ""fixed"" was leaking the very next morning all over my driveway. They claimed to have performed a complete 1 year service check as well but still leaking. Took car back in and waited 2 hours when they new I was in hurry. It was done but just sitting in back. When I complained again they said it was coming around. 10 min later I had to walk around myself and tell the guy wiping it I don't have time for a wash especially when it is sprinkling outside. So painful. ",1.3
12,"September 19, 2012","One of the most non professional car dealers I have ever visited. The sales person (Adam) was berated in front of me by the pre-owned manager Rafael. Old car tatics that you would not expect from a high line dealer. My trade went up by $5,000 by the time I left, and the price had dropped by $4,000. They sent the sales guy back and forth 6 times before the pre-owned manager came out with an attitude. I never asked for anything more than what they had advertised so WHY ALL THE GAMES??? I purchased at the location in town on Old Katy Road instead, no games, best deal first time out from a great guy named Carson. He said he sees this all the time from the store up north. Finally, as a business man myself I thought the GM would want to know. WRONG. How this guy became in charge of anything other than a garage sale I wonder. He had nothing to say, just sat there on the phone like a bump on a log. Then said if I had not purchased at the other store he would have had more concern. REALLY? No wonder they attract talent like Carson at the other location, who would want to work for this guy other than his angry used car manager and Adam who didnt know anything about the car he showed me. Wow....lost cause. Save time money and frustration, buy something else, or from someone else! RUN!!!! ",1.0
13,"June 14, 2012","This was the smoothest car purchase experience ever! I was in and out of there in two hours, which is amazing to me. I was expecting at least four hours. I never felt pressured and my sales rep, Jennifer Giovandi, made me feel like a VIP. I received a great price on my trade-in too! The Finance Director, Frank Pecka, was extremely professional, courteous and friendly. I drove out with my new car and a smile on my face. I will definitely come here for future LR purchases.",5.0

15,"March 19, 2012","the Range Rover is a great vehicle when it works.  unfortunately our had isues regularly and was in the shop often.  transmission issues, suspension issues, electrical issues, a/c issues, you name it.  three of the issues that were the worst were as follows:  the vehicle stayed in the shop for 5 weeks because the dealership at Land Rover Houston North kept getting the wrong part shipped to them from England- guess what, we had not had the vehicle 6 months.  the next issue related to the electronic transmission.  there was a problem with the computer programming that controlled when the vehicle switched gears.  the service guys said that they were aware of the problem and that Land Rover was working to correct it, once it was corrected, they would fix our programming.  they also admitted that they were aware of the problem but still sold us the vehicle anyway- thanks for that!  as for an extension of the transmission warranty?  not a chance.  the final straw, and please keep in mind there were many other issues besides the ones i have listed- i picked up my vehicle from Land Rover North Houston after having the oil changed.  i got on the interstate and found that my vehicle was shaking violently.  when i pulled over i found that they had not tightened the lug nuts and my wheel was about to fall off!  i was in sight of the dealership but they made me sit on the side of the freeway for 45 minutes before someone showed up to help me out!  their service at LR North Houston is TERRIBLE.  also, the lug nut wrench that came with the vehicle doesnt fit the actual lug nuts on the tire!  so if you get a flat, you have a useless tool.  after the experience with the tire comming off i called their GM.  he never appologised, claimed that they did not touch the tires- although rotating the tires is part of the oil change???- and then went on to tell me that i must have bought an aftermarket lug wrench- which i had not.  terrible dealership, terrible service, you have heard what happened to me- good luck",1.5
16,"March 15, 2012","This place is a complete joke. After bringing my Land Rover in multiple times for the same thing they still could not fix it
They are not very knowledgeable about the product nor very friendly. Joe The so called service manager would not even 
Return my phone calls nor did the general mgr A.J. giblon. I pray nobody ever goes to this joke of a dealership. And Jaguar and Land Rovers are lemons anyways and I don't see how they stay in business.",1.0
17,"March 07, 2012","i bought a new range rover evoque dynamic and after few weeks found out that the rear a/c vents are missing, so i called the dealer and asked how did this happened at first my sales person told me they dont exist in the car which is not true.After 2 weeks of wait i had to call the corporate office of LandRover to notify them and lady i was talking to found out in 30 min that they forgot to install it in the car.I called north land rover and asked for service manager instead the receptionist connected me to my sales rep.Long story short it has been 2 weeks and i am still waiting for a service managers call but he seems to be very busy doing his own things rather than making sure he does whathe is hired for.i think its about time land rover should think of stopping monopoly of one company owning every single dealership in houstonp",1.4

20,"September 02, 2010","Ms. Munoz was very friendly and helpful from the time I saw her in the car lot.  She asked probing questions but never pushy, she answered the questions and clarified the questions I asked to ensure I understood the information she was sharing with me.  She never seemed frustrated when I wasn't sure of what I wanted, yet I could see she desperately wanted to understand my desire and then provide me with what I wanted or a reasonable substitute with plusses and minuses of the choice.  She let me decide what I wanted to spend and never tried to put me into a situation that was not fully understood by me.  It was one of the most pleasant auto purchases experiences I have had in a very long time.  

Ms. Munoz and your finance officer are keepers.

Be blessed,

21,"August 17, 2010","This was a great experience with the staff and it went extremely well with our salesperson (Nikki Mojica).  We purchase a used 05 Benz CLK 320.

22,"July 19, 2010","I was in the market for my 5th Land Rover and via e-mail/telephone I was assured by Carson Bryant that we could make a deal.  I arrived early for my 10:00 ""appointment"" and was told that Carson was not in and they had no clue where he was or when he would be in to work.  

I then received a message from Carson stating that he was at the airport picking up a client and wanted to move our appointment to the afternoon.  Since I had driven 30 miles, and it was 10:45 at this point, I was not about to leave and come back.  Another salesperson attempted to assist me and quoted a payment close to double the amount Carson and I discussed.  

I started to leave, but then felt the manager should be made aware of the deceiptive tactics to get me into the dealership.  The manager offered me a demo vehilce with 5,000 miles on it in a color that I did not want, at a payment still hundreds above the amount i was promised.",1.0
23,"July 06, 2010","The sales staff was very friendly from the moment we got there. Everyone was helpful, and even though our sale took a while to complete the experience was still enjoyable.

25,"June 27, 2010","From my first visit of inquiring about the Range Rover thru the final step of driving out with my new vehicle, every step was handled with extreme professionalism. From the phone operator, saleslady and finance department, each one was very helpful,easy to work with,and answered all of my questions.  My situation was a little unique in that I did all the negoiating, picking out of the vehicle, agreed price and prelim paperwork without my husband. Intending the bring him just to sign final documents.  Never once did the staff question my intentions or make me feel as though I could not take care of these decisions wthout my husband.  I will definitely recommend your dealership.  Regards

26,"June 21, 2010","On Saturday, June 12, 2010, I called Land Rover Jaguar Houston North to inquire about used Range Rovers in stock.  I spoke with Nikki Mojica who was extremely professional and patient with me and answered all of my questions.  At the end of the telephone call, Ms. Mojica stated she would call me back if she was able to locate a Range Rover that met my specifications.  Within one hour, Ms. Mojica called back to advise that there was a vehicle in stock at Land Rover Jaguar Houston North available for purchase.  On this same day, I visited the dealership and met with Ms. Mojica who accompanied me on the test drive.  During and after the test drive, Ms. Mojica took the time to show me all features of the vehicle which aided in my selection of this vehicle for purchase.  I did not anticipate purchasing the vehicle on this day, but due to the pricing and mileage, and most importantly, the patience, dedication, and professionalism of Ms. Mojica, I purchased the vehicle. 

I would recommend Land Rover Jaguar Houston North to potential buyers and would recommend that they request Nikki Mojica as a sales consultant!

29,"May 31, 2010","My wife and I bought a pre-owned 07 Range Rover Sport.  Nikki Mojica was our sales consultant.  She was knowledgeable, friendly and very attentive.  She also made us feel very welcome.  When we bought the truck last week it need a part replaced in the armrest and it also need new rear tires (part of our sales agreement).  Nikki ordered the needed part and the new rear tires for our truck they're schedule to be installed early this week.  So there are still some details to truly finalize this deal, however, I'm confident that previous behavior is a good indication of future performance.  Based on the great communication and treatment we've been shown so far by the friendly staff (including finance manager, Roy who by the way has an excellent sense of humor and actually made the experience joyful rather than stressful), I have tremendous confidence in this dealership.  I look forward to them following through without a hitch.  This is a 5-star establishment in form and conduct.  It's staff are responsible for making it shine.",5.0
30,"May 28, 2010","2010 Dealerrater Review

Purpose:  Buy an LR-2 having automatic seat adjustments and a lighter interior color.  Trade in 2009 LR-2 with 22,000 miles on it.

Dealer:  Jaguar Land Rover Houston North

Result:  We bought the vehicle we wanted.  The dealer service was again excellent.  This dealership makes most parts of the buying process easy and enjoyable.  They do most things very well.  They try to honor special requests, but can not really do much more than their standard excellent service for a customer.

My wife and I got interested in a Land Rover upgrade on Saturday, April 16, 2010.  She spotted an advertisement on the Internet for a new manufacturer’s financing program for 2% interest.  We were paying more than 6% interest on a 6-year note, having bought the first Land Rover the previous August.  The details of that happy purchase experience are on dealerrater.com.  We felt it was possible that we could own a new vehicle for about the same amount of money per month as we were currently paying on the 6% note.

On Monday afternoon, April 19, I telephoned the dealer, using the main 1.832.249.2000 number.  Anne Scavelli, the always-friendly telephone receptionist and front desk greeter, answered the phone and told me that our previous salesman, Juan Carlos Paramo, is no longer with the dealership.  She connected me to Randy Calabro.  He identified himself as the dealership’s internet salesman, listened to my questions about financing, and explained the variable 0.9% to 2.9% manufacturers’ financing packages available.  In summary, 0.9% was for 36 months, 1.9% was for 48 months, and 2.9% was for 60 months.  We discussed specific monthly payments for certain amounts of financing.  I asked for an appointment to meet a salesman that evening with my wife.  Randy scheduled an appointment with Anthony Styles, who we recognized as the man who took a picture of my wife and a jaguar in the showroom for fun the previous year.  Randy also said that Jason Lacher (the dealership General Manager) is his boss, and that Rebecca White, who had previously done the financing paperwork, is now a stay-at-home mom. 

I called my insurance agent that afternoon, and had his oral agreement to bind the insurance company for the new vehicle before I went to the dealer.  He faxed it to me.  My insurance agent is John Curtis, and the assistant named David Smith found a way to reduce my monthly policy payments with a new discount. The agent’s telephone number is 1.432.617.3276.  I also removed our personal belongings, cleaned the old LR-2 and gave it an exterior carwash.  I washed the rims because this one cleaning technique has a subliminal effect on perceived car value far in excess of the value of time spent to clean them.

Anthony Styles gave us really excellent service during and after the sale.  He listens well, and even performed manual labor to speed the process of dealer preparation following conclusion of the sale.  That evening, Anthony was ready for us.  Randy had alerted him to our expressed desire to buy a new LR-2 or one that had been a dealer loaner car.  In about 45 minutes’ time, we tested a brand-new vehicle and 2 others that were previously loaner cars.  Because of our previous LR-2 ownership, we dispensed with the off-road demonstration. We focused on level of freeway tire noise, incremental design modifications from the 2009 model, and ease of using the automatic seat adjustments.  We just could not really justify the cost of a brand new vehicle having 18 miles on the odometer, compared to a well-maintained loaner car that had about 6,000 miles on it.  We selected a black exterior and a light interior, and found a vehicle that had the automatic seat and mirror adjustment option, but not many of the other luxury options that did not appeal to us.  This combination of options was not available in 2009.  Thus, we found the vehicle with exactly the features we wanted in less than an hour.

While we were test-driving our new vehicle, the dealership staff was evaluating our original LR-2 for an trade-in offer.  Once we selected the vehicle, Anthony set us down at his desk and we mentioned some ballpark figures for vehicle costs.  Anthony verified the mileage and the remaining balance of our current car note.  Then he went to his boss, Darrell Ayres, and got us an offer sheet with suggested prices and dealer terms.  Because we were a returning customer, we got an automatic extra discount of $1000 on the new vehicle.  We also got a $3000 discount for the roughly 6000 miles of wear-and-tear on a well-maintained vehicle.  The dealer also gave us a free navigation package, including a Garmin Nuvi GPS for the LR-2.  However, the dealer offered a conservative trade in value on our old vehicle.  Three rounds of negotiations later, Ayres raised the trade-in value $2000, paid half the $2000 of principle in excess of vehicle value on the 2009 car note, and agreed to a down payment of $1000, instead of the usual $3000 to $8000.  We picked a 2.9% note for 60 months, a step that will eliminate excess principle on a vehicle that could depreciate in the first year faster than a 72 month note would pay off the principle.  All told, we were able to reduce our purchase price settlement by almost 10% of the initial offer sheet.  Darrell worked overtime that evening, until about 8:30 pm, and I thanked him personally for meeting our financial needs and putting us into new car financing that evening at a nice price.   The financing was arranged by Keith Kay, who worked hard to arrange all the paperwork in a timely manner.  (He has since that time left the dealership, but he did a quick and accurate job for us that evening.)  Fortunately, since most of the paperwork is generated on a computer, when we found a small mis-spelling, we were able to correct that with a delay of less than 5 minutes.  We signed the many pages of contract paperwork, including documents for the state of Texas, the Chase Bank group which does manufacturers financing for Land Rover, the Land Rover North America people in New Jersey, the dealer, and ourselves.  We got a temporary plate, and drove off in the new vehicle as darkness fell around 8:30.  I agreed to come back the next day at 10:00 am for the usual dealer prep.  At home, my wife and I re-stocked our personal gear into the new version of our LR-2.  We also placed 2 home-made, personally designed interior sunroof covers into the car to correct for the only obvious flaw in LR-2 design—a lack of adequate solar protection for occupants in the summer, and no Land Rover parts designed or marketed to block out the intense Texas sun.

Anthony arranged an appointment for me at 10 am Tuesday.  I showed up with the vehicle then.  Anthony showed me how to work the memory seat controls again, and we discussed a soft whining sound when the A/C is turned on.  I also told him that our previous LR-2 had sometimes made the same noise.  I also showed him the small cigarette carpet burn by the passenger door that my wife and I had not noticed until morning.  I said that this small “blem” was normal wear and tear, and not an issue.  Anthony showed me the customer lounge, estimated that dealer prep would take about an hour, and took the care back for servicing.  At noon, Anthony had a status report for me.  It was a tough day in the service department, because of problems with the diagnostic computer.  As a result, the second key would have to be “programmed” for our vehicle on a different day.  Also, the whine was due to a malfunction in the computer which controls the air conditioning, and would require a replacement part to be shipped for installation the next week.  Anthony took me back to the repair bays area for some snacks out of the snack machine, and we also inspected the new type of EZ-tag (automatic toll road recorder) that goes on the front bumper and is transferable, saving $15 each time.  At 2 pm, I had to leave for an appointment.  The normal dealer prep wasn’t finished, but I couldn’t wait more than 4 hours during the workday.  Anthony personally had been cleaning the vehicle, removing the floor mat clear plastic wrap, and other tasks.  He brought the car up front, and I agreed to come back to finish dealer prep when the A/C computer part was in stock.  I went to the EX tag store and got the “bar tag” for the vehicle.  We also installed the Garmin Nuvi and later, uploaded the GPS updates from our home computer.  I also applied the special leather protection cleanser to all the seats and other leather parts in the vehicle.  This stuff, called “s” is available in the dealership parts department.

The following week we got an email from Robyn Hosch at the dealership, advising me that the part arrived.  Anne Scavelli also called to find out if I wanted to have the license plate mailed or picked up.  Robyn had designated Alaro Ramirez as my service advisor.  I called him, and we settled on a day for the installation of the part and the rest of dealer prep. Al indicated that the warranty work to replace the computer part would take more than a day, because the entire dashboard would need removal and replacement in the process.  

Al arranged a free loaner car and asked me to come in on Wednesday, May 5 at 10:00 am.  When I arrived, Anthony Styles greeted me and put my license plates on the vehicle himself, while we were discussing optimum bar tag placement, plastic vs. metal license plate screws, and other technical and legislative developments in the placement of license plate dealer promotional covers.  For now, we left the rear promotional cover on the LR-2.  Anthony introduced me to Al.  Al and I discussed the work for the appointment.  My wife and I put 1,800 miles on the fun LR-2 in 2 weeks.  In addition to the warranty work, the free 7,500 mile oil change and check up would be performed, the dealer prep would be finished, the free tank of gasoline would now be supplied, and the second key would be programmed.  We also discussed a newly developed sound of plastic rubbing when the steering column turned.   We discussed the dealer’s choice of 93 octane Exxon gasoline for giving customers a free tank of gas.  Al said that this gasoline never has more than 10% ethanol, but that other brands add unauthorized extra ethanol in their gasoline.  

Al arranged for me to meet Cliff Holverson, the on-site Enterprise service representative.  Enterprise has improved their service.  I was driving away in the car less than 10 minutes after I sat down with Cliff.  I got the rental protection coverage.  Enterprise did not charge the credit card right away, but only took a $50 “hold” (authorization).  I was comfortable in the loaner car, a Hyundai Elantra having 14,732 miles on it.  Some previous renter had violated the no-smoke rental policy, but I wasn’t really bothered by the slight cigarette residue in the  rental car A/C.    The rental car was clean, well maintained, and in excellent condition.  Also, when we picked up our LR-2 from Al on Saturday morning, the Enterprise contract was closed that day, instead of the following Monday.  

Charlie the mechanic (tech # 7244) had replaced the dashboard so it looked brand new.  The A/C worked fine without whining.  He also diagnosed the rubbing as caused by the front of our after-market floor mat abutting the steering column at exactly the spot where the turning wheel shaft is exposed, instead of cased off.  He pulled the floor mat back and the sound disappeared.  The only downside was a  2 inch x 0.1 inch black stain on the driver’s seat, and a similar stain on the floor.  All in all, the appointment went very well.  The 3 days total time was unexpected, but we had a free loaner car.  In that time, we got to appreciate the LR-2 a lot more, especially the quiet cabin and higher view of the road.  The cashier, Shari, was friendly when we picked up the keys, and there was no charge from the dealer for 3 days of work. 

We took an approximately 500 mile drive in the LR-2 that day, and discovered that we got 6% better gas mileage on 89 octane Shell gas than the 93 octane Exxon gas.  The error bar for the test is about 4%, so the result is significant, even though only one tank of 93 octane gas was used.  We switched back to the 89 octane gas.  I haven’t heard yet from the dealership whether the 93 octane gas is more effective in stop-and-go driving than for highway driving.  I hope to hear from them, if any other test data is in their database.

Truly, the manufacturers’ financing program provided the incentive for us to trade in a fine car that was bought only 8 months earlier.  This financing was through Chase Auto Group, which does not have direct access to applicants’ personal records and other accounts at Chase Bank.   Also, the paperwork for the car title and financing had to show a physical address, even though we don’t like getting mail to our residence address.  In the first week, I tried hard to get as much of the paperwork changed in the dealership to reflect our preferred mailing address.   Keith Kay and Kelly Marshoni, the dealerships’ customer care database expert, worked hard to change as much of the electronic records of our mailing address as possible the third week of April 2010. So far, six weeks later, our financing notices now comes to the correct PO Box address, and about half the promotional materials from Land Rover North America.  We got our ADVANTAGE PLUS package from Kennesaw, Georgia on a rainy day to our residence address, but the plastic outer wrap protected the contents.  We are 6-and-6 now for mail to the house vs. PO Box.  My hope is that the ratio gets better.  I have not yet contacted Siobhan at Land Rover North America at 1.800.637.6837x2943 in New Jersey yet to verify the corrected mailing address.  I did that 2 months after the last LR-2 was purchase, and after Kelly Marshoni’s and Darrell Ayres’s 4 attempts to correct our mailing address in August and September 2009 didn’t work.  Even with Siobhan’s efforts, I still received 2 items at the residence address in March 2010.  I also hope that Chase Auto Finance Group changes their policy on automobile address on auto loan applications, so that I won’t have to weed out and correct mis-addressed mail for many months to come.  Miles at Chase Auto Finance Group said that once the note is set up (a process that can take up to 2 weeks, but which took only 4 days for us) the paymatic forms and other loan information can be sent to a P.O. Box address.  Once the car loan shows up on the Internet accounts information for Chase customers, they can call Chase Finance Group and get their personal information changed, so that only one or two financial statements to a residence address need to occur. The first paymatic automatic draft will be in July, only 2 months after we financed the car--not bad. If Chase changes its physical address requirement, then all the paperwork on our next Land Rover can originate at our PO Box.  Otherwise, we will just have to do commercial auto loan financing elsewhere, or put up with mailings to our residence address, no matter what is done at 4 locations in 3 different states, by at least 12 people, to change it to a PO Box address.  Maybe a correct mailing address for Land Rover promotional materials and other important mail-outs is something that Mr. Tata, the Land Rover Company owner in India can do something about; but we all in North America can’t stop the material from coming to a physical mailing address we don’t want to use.

31,"May 24, 2010","I recently bought a well used Jeep at Jaguar/Land Rover Houston North and I was very impressed with how I was treated. I was not buying an expensive car (probably the cheapest car on the lot) but they treated me like I was. I have bought cars at other dealerships and have even worked at various dealerships during college and so I have seen the way different dealerships are ran. The way customers are treated can always be traced back to management. A great management team sets the good example and then trains their staff on how to treat customers.

33,"May 09, 2010","I left my car at work for three and a half months during my travels. When I arrived to get my car I could not open the door at all because the remote was not working. The buttons on the either of my keys where not doing anything at all. I didn't know if it was a problem with the car battery or just that the remote battery was dead. All I could think of how I was going to get into my car. 

I was able to speak with Carson Bryan on the phone, who was extremely helpful. He walked me step by step on how to get into my vehicle. Carson had told me that there was a key inside the remote (which i had no idea) which would open the car. I was able to open my door and start the car. He explained to me that the problem was that my car had been sitting there so long without running the battery. This lack of charge could have caused the remote to not open the car. The remote worked fined after this.

I had no idea what I was going to do if I could not get into my car because the closest dealership is about two hours away. I was in the middle of my parking lot alone at work with all my luggage. I am really appreciative that Carson was able to help me through this struggle. Thank you for your help!

46,"January 28, 2010","To whom it may concern.

This is a word of advise when purchasing a used car at Land Rover Houston-North. This is applied when one is having your car either repaired or dropped-off for service. 
Be aware about existing warranty on the vehicle, additional extended warranties and what is really covered. 
I am extremely disappointed especially on level of tolerance and how receptive the management treats their customers in determining whether your problem is cover or not ondur exixting protection plans on your vehicle. It is a total different experience from purchasing a car, which I had an excellent one.
The Service Manager was very impolite not leaving you any options available although I was not at fault. This issue was a result of a poorly work done before the vehicle was sold to me, and two months later the imperfections starting showing. I did refer this issue to the person above mentioned. Instead, his attitude was rather critical and negative toward the vehicle and my persona (he really had forgotten that the staff under his supervision performed job). I was blown-off completely, in a very rude way. It made it clear that one really end-up paying in service, what you saved on the purchased of the vehicle. In order to escalate the issue properly and professionally, I decided to call his Supervisor. Unfortunately and ""apparently"" this gentleman was not at his office, so I left a courtesy message with a brief explanation on my problem. He never returned my calls. 
I am professional in the management and executive level. My complaint is not based on monetary issues. It is rather focused on the attitude, and lack of customer satisfaction on this individuals in that organization. I am the type of professional that when credit is due I do certainty take the time to give it. But also it goes the other way, such this this case. 
I can understand that these individuals have heard any excuse there is from people trying to get away with wrong-doing. 
I am taking my time to feedback to you, and to advise that I took my vehicle to another Land Rover location, and their curtesy and attitude was totally oposite from the one experience at Land Rover Houston-North. My issue was taken care of without hesitation. 
Also it is showed in this opportunity that the concept of ""Customer Satisfaction"" for Land Rover Houston-North is just rhetoric.....Good day

Summary:
Very good service, especially on the most important things, but has poorer service on special details--which they work hard to correct if a problem arises.
Details:
The dealer has a really good team approach to the vehicle sale.  Juan Carlos did a good test drive, and then asked us what we want--very important.  We made a deal; dealer accepted our trade-in with a fair offer; Rebecca got us financed at a preferred rate in less than an hour.  They prepped the vehicle on very short notice, and opened special places in the dealership to get parts that were needed, such as an interior trunk cover.  We drove off with the new vehicle less than 2 hours after we showed up for a test drive.  We retrieved a pair of gloves from our trade-in 2 days later--the dealer found them okay, and brought them to us in the office of Keith and Darrell on a day that Juan Carlos had the day off.  We got a thank you letter from Juan Carlos 2 days later to the wrong address.  I called up the dealership, and Kelly Marshoni quickly and professionally updated my file for the correct mailing address.  Now we should get our mail from them okay.  Later today I will correct the mailing address at the car note lending institution.  Two days later, I emailed Juan Carlos, and left a message for him by telephone the next day with 4 questions about the purchased vehicle.  I reached Juan Carlos by phone the next week, and he worked quickly to respond to each question.  The dealer called me about 3 days before the temporary plates expired to notify me that the license plates had arrived.  I telephoned Juan Carlos for an appointment, and was able to arrange for the oil change the same day.  I strongly recommend that anybody doing service there to call ahead to make sure they have the time--we shifted my plans only 1 hour, on just 3 hours' notice, so that I could do all the necessary details in just one trip.  At the point of sale, Juan Carlos promised a free oil change--we used it when the plates arrived, about a week earlier than the prescribed mileage--no problem. The dealer uses the correct motor oil, and offers a free oil change to each customer, from what I understand. The day of the oil change, Anne was nice and had plates ready. She is also always friendly and professional over the phone.  I guess it's better that they called me to pick up the plates; however, I was expecting them in my PO Box. Juan Carlos also secured 2 interior plastic cigarette lighter covers for me at no charge, which did not come standard with the vehicle that I purchased.  Robin was professional and nice when writing up the service order for the free oil change. I inquired about parts with Marcello on two visits.  They had a catalogue, but could not give it away--so they directed me to the website for further questions about specifications. They knew their parts and could answer most questions right on the spot.  The parts department is well stocked, and I purchased some leather cleaner there which is unavailable in standard autoparts stores.  I am pleased with the leather cleaner.  Crystal is a professional cashier, and friendly.  I waited less than an hour for the oil change, and Juan Carlos was very helpful in introducing me to Robin, directing me to Anne to pick up the plates, and getting my new vehicle from the service lane to my pickup under the south-flank portico of the dealership.  We discussed that cleaning the hubcaps of a vehicle increases the perception of cleanliness, and I cited a change in the ranking of cleanliness of cars in my rental car location from near the bottom to 6th in the nation, out of 400 rental locations, with the simple change of wiping the brake dust off the rims.  That was about 10 years ago, in an industry I no longer work for.  I recommended that step for the dealers' loan-a-cars, which are fine vehicles and quite clean inside.  Finally, the waiting lobby is nice, has good TV, and excellent coffee. No mention of this dealership would be complete without fine words for James Herford, who patiently and professionally answered all our questions about the Land Rover that we test-drove in 2006.  He has moved on to a different brand in the same system of 260 dealers, but his professionalism brought us back to Houston North to shop in 2009.",4.0

64,"June 29, 2009","My wife and I are having a horrible experience with this dealership.  We went into the dealership at about 12:45 pm on Friday. June, 19, 2009.  We did not leave with our Certified Pre-Owned 2007 Range Rover HSE until 7:30 pm.  A light on the dash came on during the ride home.  We tried to investigate the light, but we were given the manuals for a Range Rover Sport.  After contacting the salesperson, we were told that the light was related to tire pressure.  I attempted to add air to the tire on Sunday and the valve stem broke.  My wife returned the vehicle to the dealership on Monday (3 days later).  Darrell agreed to replace the tire with the broken valve stem and give the car another inspection to check the other 3 tires for the same valve stem problem.  My wife requested the certification checklist for our vehicle.  The checklist revealed that the car was not brought up to standards before we left on Friday, June 19th.  Three of the tires were at 3/32” tread and the tire with the broken valve stem was at 4/32” tread.  For certification, tires must be at 4/32” tread.  Our front brake pads measured 1mm and our rear pads measured 3mm.  Only our front pads were replaced.  Certification requires that the pads be at least 50% of new.  New pads start out at 10-12mm.  Our pads were below 50%.  When my wife picked up our vehicle from the dealership on Friday, June 26, 2009,
she spoke with the general manager Jason Lacher.  He agreed to replace the 3 tires that did not meet specs.  After reviewing the entire chain of events, we realized that the dealership still did not pay for the tire that had the broken valve stem, and our rear brake pads still do not meet certification requirements.  I have left Jason voicemail messages and sent an email stating the unresolved issues that we have with this dealership.

If you disregard my experience and still decide to buy a certified pre-owned vehicle from this dealership, be sure to request the checklist for your vehicle and also a list of the measurements required to meet certification.

After the general manager received my email regarding the unresolved issues, he opted to just let us return the car rather than doing the proper repairs to bring the car up to the certification standards.

We returned the car on Thursday July 2, 2009.  The nightmare is over!!!!",1.4

Overall the dealership is great and should keep you as a return customer.,4.6
74,"May 13, 2009","Anthony was my salesman and he called quickly after I inquired online and met with me the same day, it was easy doing business with him as he is quite laid back.  The dealership was warm, clean, inviting and had a fabulous coffee machine that served Chai Lattes how cool is that!  I also got to watch the Cavs smother the Hawks on A flat screen while I waited and sipped my latte in a big leather chair nice way to wait.  

We test drove MY beautiful certified 2006 LR3 then he took me on the rock course SOLD!  I like no bull business quick easy out the door and he had the car in my drive way in less than 24 hours.

Did I mention Ms. White in financing had crayons and a coloring book for my daughter?  I love prepared people(she even gave me magazine I wanted because it had a restaurant guide I had to have).  That step was quicker than ive ever experienced since so much time spent trying to upsale that its nice to be in and out in a hour without being pressured to buy more.  

When I was leaving Anthony not only put my belongings in my new LR3 he even installed my daughters car seat nice, that was appreciated.  

Overall this was a great experience and will definitely be passing the word along.

75,"May 11, 2009","found a used vechicle, able to agree on a very fair price, got top dollar on my trade, enjoyed free expresso while waiting for paperwork, which didn't take long
I'd recommend them based on this experience, they were very nice and didn't try any silly sales tactics",5.0
76,"May 02, 2009",I don't live near the dealership but they made the purchasing process fairly easy. Once I went onto their website I contacted immediately by Mr. Styles. He listened to my needs and developed a deal that was suitable for me. Normally buying a car is a long process but I didn't spend over an hour at the location. ,5.0
77,"May 01, 2009","I was looking at trade in my '07 Nissan Maxima to a Land Rover LR3. I needed a car for extreme offroading. The dealer had several used Land Rovers on location. I was convinced that the Land Rover was a great car for off road after a short test drive through a customized ""off road track"" they had on location. I will ship the car off to Oman where i am going to be living. So i guess it remains to be seen how good it actually is off the road.... Great dealer and great service!",5.0
78,"April 23, 2009",Excellent service. I was accommodated well and I hope to do more business in the future. I chose this dealership initially because of proximity of location from my home and was pleasantly surprised by the extra step service provided for me. It was my pleasure to be your customer.,5.0
79,"March 31, 2009","Stuart Adams was one of the best car salesmen that I have delt with in over 30 years of buying cars.   He did everything I asked for and more to make me happy.  He was very ethical and straightforward which are rare qualities for people who sell cars.  I would recommend him to anyone who is interested in buying a car...He is just a great salesman and a good guy to boot.  I also hear that he is a good singer.  How can you top that!  Rebecca White was also great to work with in Finance.  Only real problem is the guys who clean up the cars...need help here, but I understand they are working on that.",4.6
80,"March 27, 2009",Greeted very kindly. Service after purchase has been great. Stuart Adams has really been helpful in my first car purchase. Has been prompt with callbacks and helpful with assistance. Dealership has done a good job of paperwork and keeping everything simple. Thank you.,4.8
81,"March 22, 2009","Purchased the car while living abroad... angela was very patient, helpful and made the process easy for me.  Price was excellent.  I also needed the vehicle shipped to a state other than Texas and she arranged for that as well. The vehicle was used and was in excellent condition. Overall, the experience was great.  Only two minor issues: a few interior flaws I wasnt anticipating but nothing that was too shocking for a used vehicle... and no floor mats (a very dumb corporate land rover thing)... this is my second range rover and when I bought my first one the dealer threw those in for free.  It would have been nice to get them for free or at least be aware the car wasnt coming with any and have the ability to purchase from LR houston to save on the hassle of rounding them up in my home state.... oh well.  Angela was great overall and I appreciated all her help.  WOULD/WILL DEFINITELY RECOMMEND HER.",5.0
82,"March 18, 2009","I live overseas in Kuwait and I was interested in buying a car from Land Rover Houston North whereby I was directed to deal with Juan Carlos. Juan was the best person I have ever dealt with in a business transaction. He was so honest, cooperative, helpful and a person that deals with customers as ""everything is possible and doable"". Doing a business transaction remotely can be very frustrating, but Juan made it as if I am sitting on the other side of his desk. Thank you Juan.  ",5.0
83,"March 16, 2009","Completely Awsome experience.  My easiest auto purchase ever.  AJ even delivered the vehicle, all the way accross town, on the most awful weather day. He then offered a very detailed and complete demonstration of the vehicle.

The finance department was a pleasure also.  No upsale, just straight forward transaction.

84,"March 12, 2009","AJ made the buying experience very easy and pleasant.  Even though I stopped in to look at another model of car that I saw on the lot, I left with an LR3! I stopped by on Saturday and left with the car on Monday ... the delay was my choice, not caused by the dealership.

I have not had any service yet, so I couldn't answer the quality of work question.",5.0
85,"March 07, 2009","Marlon did a great job, especially on the test drive! Will be coming back soon. He was very knowledgeable throughout the entire visit and took the time to show us all the cars we wanted to see. I was also impressed with the dealership as a whole, as after we were through speaking with Marlon, we were approached several times by other salesmen asking us if we needed help.",5.0
86,"March 01, 2009","I am 30 years old and I have purchased 15 vehicles. Over that time period- I worked with several sales people. Some of them I liked and most I did not. However, Nikki Mojika is really the reason that I purchased my new vehicle. She made me feel so comfortable! She was not pushy, but she made sure that I worked out a deal that I knew was right for me. As far as I am concerned-I will never purchase a new vehicle from anyone from now on, but her.

Thanks,

87,"February 27, 2009","I have been around car dealerships for quite a while and Steve Muffley at Land Rover Houston North has been by far the greatest salesperson to deal with. Great job Steve! I will tell all my friends about him and the dealership, everything was upfront and easy. Most everything was accomplished via phone and email. Again, great job Steve Muffley!",5.0

89,"February 26, 2009",Nikki Mojica always takes great care of us when it's time for a new Range Rover.  Nikki had everything ready for us when we got there.  She took care of having our trade emptied and didn't let us forget our ez tag sticker :)  Our new Range Rover was ready for us to take off once we signed our papers.  Thanks Nikki!,5.0
90,"February 26, 2009","This was my first luxury car buying experience and Angela made it everything I thought it would be.  She was friendly, fair and honest.  My buying experience with Angela from the moment I set foot in the dealership to her follow up after delivery has been fantastic!  I highly recommend her.  You will not be disappointed!

91,"February 19, 2009",My husband and I have dealt with Nikki Mojica on numerous vehicle purchases from this dealer and a previous dealer.  I have purchased 3 vehicles from her recently and she always makes the experience very easy and fast.  I would recommend her to my friends and family.  She always meets my needs and is very willing to accomodate in anyway she can.  ,5.0
92,"February 16, 2009","Dealing with Stuart Adams made this the most pleasurable car buying experience I've had to date. Even though accounting screwed up the paperwork when it came time for me to sign everything, overall it was still worth the wait. Stuart was courteous, knowledgeable, not overbearing, and answered all my questions. As someone who buys one or two new cars every year for my wife, kids, and employees, I appreciate being treated in a professional manner which is what Stuart and Land Rover Houston North did. Thanks again!",5.0
93,"February 10, 2009","Land Rover north was great.  I live in River oaks, but drove all the way up to 1960 since they had the black on black Range Rover HSe that I wanted.  Angela worked to get me the best deal and I paid cash for the car.  She even drove all the way down to River Oaks the next day to pick me up so I could get my old car.  Anyway, I really enjoy my new Range Rover and the purcahse experience was excellent.",5.0
94,"February 09, 2009","I was recommended to contact Angela Bassett by a friend that had previously bought from Angela.  I contacted her, and she was very helpful and patient.  I had a specific request for a type of car I was looking for, and she kept me informed often as to the progress of her findings.  I went to other dealers looking at cars, and she was able to tell me if it was a fair deal or not, and what she thought she could do for me.  After dealing with her for several weeks, she contacted me that they had taken a car in trade that was exactly what I was looking for.  She gave me the price of the car, and had the car service and cleaned for us to test drive.  I did my homework on various sites and found the price she had was very good.  She and the entire dealership worked with me to get an excellent rate on financing, and were patient while we made our final decisions on the car.  I most appreciated the follow-up I had with Angela, and the lack of sales pressure to buy just any car.  She went out of her way to give me the facts to tough questions, even if it was not in her best interest.  We love our car and look forward to doing business with Angela for our next car.",5.0
95,"February 09, 2009","LR Houston North and AJ in particular were extremely helpful in getting me the car I wanted, Range Rover Sport Supercharged in red, for the price I wanted to pay. The follow up from AJ was exemplary. I have no reservations at all in recommending this dealership to anyone wanting a Land Rover, Range Rover or Jaguar.

96,"February 06, 2009","Purchasing a vehicle from this dealership has far exceeded any other dealership experience. The reason for my visit was to look at a car my boyfriend was considering buying for himself. (He had visited another LR dealership the previous day however felt as if he was not treated properly and not taken seriously).  At the time, buying a car for me was not even a consideration so I knew nothing about LR.  All I knew was they looked great on the road. 

As I listened to Mr. Earl explain the quality, craftsmanship, and over all performance of the vehicle I understood why someone would want to own such a great vehicle. So I decided to take a little spin and determine for myself. Well I loved it!  Since I drive long distances to work, safety was the first priority and then of course comfort and convenience features. It is great to drive vehicle that has everything you need plus all the extras.  

Rebecca works in the financing department and was superb.  Again no pressure to buy or add-on extra warranties.  She actually helped me determine what warranties would be best. By asking me questions, we were able to customize what would be beneficial and suit my needs efficiently and be cost effective.

Since the purchase I have been in for service.  (This was by choice though not for any type of mechanical problem).  The service department is extremely friendly. The modifications performed by the technicians in the parts department took pride in their work and were extremely detailed oriented. They didn’t leave my car messy.  Also Jose picked me up from my office and was very prompt, professional, and even opened and closed the car door for me.  Jose even helped me with my work bags.  

The best part about the experience…I never felt pressured to buy. I would certainly recommend this dealership and owning your own LR. You won’t regret it.

97,"February 06, 2009","I recently upgraded my 2005 Land Rover LR3 to a new 2008 LR3 at this dealership.  I must say it was the best car buying experience that I've ever had.  From the friendliness of the entire staff to the buying process it was all excellent.  

Stuart the sales representative helped me on my deal.  From the initial phone call that got me interested in driving from central Houston to North Houston and the time he spent with us throughout the process.  He was friendly and knowledgeable about the product and what he didn't know he didn't hesitate bringing over an expert to fill in the gaps.

The rest of the process from the sales manager to the financing process, was all done professionally with little or no pressure on the deal or on add-ons.  A thoroughly pleasant experience.  As I stated earlier, my best car buying experience ever.

The service department also did excellent work getting my LR3 ready and spending extra time to get some custom work done right, the first time. I'm very pleased with the vehicle and the total experience.",5.0
98,"February 04, 2009","I really enjoyed my experience at this dealership.  This was my first vehicle purchase and I was very nervous and did not want to get ""screwed"".  I give the dealership and John the best rating possible because I felt that John and the overall dealership were very upfront and honest from the very beginning.  Before going to this dealership, I went to another Landrover dealership in Houston and I just did not feel like they wanted my business or cared about my experience.  John, thank you for your services and thank you for answering all my questions.  You are very much appreciated.

99,"January 25, 2009",Stuart's professional attitude is what brought us back to LR to purchase a new car.  We visited a few other dealerships and were not as comfortable with the sales representatives we spoke with.  When working with Stuart we felt good about our decisions and whom we were working with.  We would definitely recommend a friend to visit the Land Rover dealer and ask for Stuart by name.,4.8
