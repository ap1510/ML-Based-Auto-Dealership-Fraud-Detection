0,"June 23, 2020","DO NOT BUY FROM THIS DEALERSHIP! I bought a used F-450 that was low mileage from the salesman “Big Ben”. We test drove the truck together and I heard a slight whine noise from underneath. I asked “Big Ben” if the truck was throughly inspected? And he went to brag on how good “Rockwall Dodge” shop is and how they do there inspections. I didn’t think anything of it. The truck ran great on the test drive. I bought it. While it was getting detailed I noticed that it was low on coolant and I said something about it to “Big Ben” and again he assured me that the truck was serviced and nothing to worry about! I didn’t think anything of it it’s a BIG DEALERSHIP! They wouldn’t sell a vehicle with problems or not serviced! I drove 2hrs home to Chico Tx and the next morning I checked over the truck and admiring my purchase. I had to put 2 gallons of coolant in it! Checked the oil, it was BLACK! And none of the grease points were touched! It was never serviced or inspected! So 30 days later “I haven’t even made my first payment yet” the TURBO BLOWS UP! I called there “SERVICE DEPARTMENT” got the run around and they sent me to my salesman “BIG BEN”. NO ANSWER! NOT EVEN A CALL BACK! But he did respond to my txt and said “I’m sorry to hear about the truck it’s as is where is”! I understand that. I do completely! but if you ain’t got the common curtesy to even call back or even offer any kind of help with this pickup. That’s BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE! Do not believe anything they tell you about a vehicle! They are crooks! They don’t inspect anything! They just put it on the line and sell it! And also..,I still haven’t got a call back from ANYONE from that dealership ",1.0
1,"November 30, 2019","This dealership is a complete joke when it comes to actually getting a good deal especially if you're disabled combat veteran. I wasted a complete hour just to be insulted by the new car staff trying to take advantage of me. They were trying to double their profits on my trade-in and the new vehicle I was looking at. It was so bad that not even a manager would take the time to try and help me out. The ownership and management team, I can personally say are the worst I've ever seen. I thought they would go the extra mile to help out I disabled combat veteran but that was the complete opposite. what really irritates me and is completely disrespectful is when a business establishment falsely claims they go the extra mile for combat veterans. this dealership did what they can to see how much money they can take away from a disabled combat veteran. I wasn't even welcomed when I arrived at their dealership I had to go and look for a staff member. When I told them I was going to write bad reviews they gave me a very evil look and that's the type of treatment that a disabled combat veteran receives in today's world. ",1.0
2,"September 02, 2019","They will not care for you, all they will care is to earn a commission. Go to hyundai or toyota. They will give you options and free oil change and even tire rotation. When you bought a car, it should be offered. They have like 60000 miles warranty. Whats the purpose of that if every 5k mileage you are worry what they gonna charge you next? It is okay to earn money, but if you can be honest and lay down what else is not inlcuded during the first day is much kinder.",2.2
3,"January 05, 2019","I used to love bringing my vehicles here, but now that Corey is gone, this place has gone to crap. Service advisors are clueless. Megan was okay to work with, and she can’t control what the jackwagons do in the back, but a little more communication would have been great. Phone rings off the hook while people stand around talking. Brought my truck in for a tire sensor issue and a new key fob programming and it’s still not done. 5 hours later, not done. Had an 8 o’clock appointment, first in line! What’s the sense in getting an appointment? Probably the two easiest things they had to do today! Just shameful!!!!!!!",1.8

So much more.  Just awful.  Hidden charges, over all bad service.  Mark tried.  All new team there again.  Horrible management. 
Service sucks",1.0
5,"November 15, 2018","I am very disappointed in rockwall dodges customer service.  My wife bought a grand Cherokee this past Saturday,  traded in her Yukon.   She was excited about the car, loved it.  But once she got home, she didn't take into consideration, car seat and 6ft teenager.  The room in the grand Cherokee was not a fit for my family and we weren't comfortable with the car.  We humbly tried to get our Yukon back,  offered to pay any service fees etc.  The gsm is a joke (Justin) He kept dodging me and wouldn't face me,  had his salesman do all the talking.   Stated vehicle has already funded.  Which was a lie.   We called and checked.  And I have been in the car business before,  and they can let you have of the deal if they want to.  We admitted fault and basically begged for help.   Chris (salesman) was slick,  professional and knew his stuff.   He was gonna give the GM my number to call me.  Well..... I wasn't surprised.. I didn't get a call back.   Feel like they just wrote me off.

I have personally been a valued customer with Dallas dodge.  Which is a sister store of rockwall dodge.  I have bought many trucks for my company from John Winesapple (past gm),  and just recently this past year my business partner and I just spent 140k for 2 new 2500 3/4 ton truck.  Phillip was the gm at the time.  

Like I said I have been a valued costumer for dodge for many years.  And they just ruined that relationship.  I had friend from Dallas dodge reach out to the gm of rockwall dodge and his response was I can put them in a VAN!!  I just laughed at the response when my buddy told me that.    That was his only solution.   We have been in the car for 3 days!!!!!!

I have a call into Ric Moreno who is the regional manager over these dealerships.  Just to let him know he has just lost a valued loyal customer over rockwall dodge customer service.  I would also like to fill him in on how his GSM and GM wouldn't talk or call me back.  That's not how you do business.  If I did business like that my company wouldn't be in business.  

I would highly recommend, if your in the market for a dodge.  I would seek better service else where.  

Best Regards

6,"September 27, 2018","I bought a 2014 ram 1500 here online the truck was 16,100 but when I went to sign paper work they bumped the sales price up to 17,900 and said they did a bunch of work to it and it was too late to back our since I already signed everything and had full cash in hand. they promised to fix the windsheild help pay for the console and all that but it took them a month to replace the windshield. Also a day after owning the truck it didn’t start and I was 40 miles from home luckily I have good friends that took me home. Then they “fixed” it and a week late it did it again. Then they “fixed” it again. A month late they had to replace something on the steering wheel and had to fix A GAS LEAK IN THE ENGINE. They never fixed the arm rest or anything. Every time I call they say my salesman has “gone home” every time I call. Will not buy a vehicle here again and disappointed I wasted my money here.",1.4
7,"September 19, 2018","I test drove a used vehicle with salesperson.  The vehicle showed low on gas but he insisted no need to stop...2 blocks from returning it ran out of gas!  When we got back he told me he would call me ""the next day.""  One week passed, I called him back, he was ""out of town...call the other salesperson.""  I called and left a message but no return call.  Because I was interested in the car I called one more time to person who is associated with my credit union.  She assured me she could help.  I went with her to test drive AGAIN, and I pulled over to put the top down (convertible).  The top wouldn't come down, and had to drive back with whining of broken convertible.  She apologized, and told me it would be fixed and she would call me back.  Its been almost a week and no call back.  The same car is still on their lot for sale.  I've purchased over 50 vehicles in my life, but my next one will NOT be from Rockwall Chrysler Jeep Dodge!",1.0
8,"February 07, 2018","Rockwall Dodge bought my truck November 3, 2017 they paid it off and 46 days after purchase which resulted in my credit score being negatively impacted. They agreed to pay more than what we owed and have not resolved the issue till this day.",1.0
9,"January 30, 2018",Amazing experience from purchase to routine services. We have purchased 4 Dodge Ram trucks from this dealership and we will not go anywhere else.  Salesman Chris Miles knows his stuff and keeps us happy and coming back! The service dept. goes above and beyond!,5.0
10,"January 10, 2018","So everything was going well until I got to the last person who was going to offer me the gap insurance. This person whose first name was ron (caucasian guy)  seemed to get upset because I declined his offer on the gap insurance. Im very familiar with insurance offering but I respectfully declined. While telling him I was not interested he basically pushed me into a corner to say yes. (Which i didnt) I felt disrespected and felt uncomfortable. He then proceeded to ask why I couldnt answer his question on why I was denying his offer. After making it clear to him that I simply didnt want to pay more a month for his offer he procceeded to insult my reasoning...and claimed I was disrespecting him...( you have to respect others and their choice to earn it, boi) after this conversation went wayyy left, he then folded my papers into envelope size and stapled the papers in the middle. To make it difficult for me to view any information once i try to open it...( funny actually)  Anywho, I feel sorry for the next person who denies his offer and dosen’t stand by their choice. 

Advice: Stand up for yourself. Don’t let anyone talk you into something you don’t want. 


Other than this incident, everyone else was quite nice and helpfull. RON messed it up for the whole team and the dealership as a whole. (For me)... personally.. I’ll definately think twice about stepping into the dealership. Maybe this lengthy message makes him better at speaking to his customers and taking “no” for an answer.",2.8

15,"December 07, 2017","So my husband and I started the whole car buying experience the last week of October. We started at Classic Dodge of Denton. While there we were treated horribly by the sales manager Keith. It was just one thing after another and he lied about us and our approval.

We than went the following weekend (first Saturday in November) to The Jeep Dealership in Rowlett Texas where we met with Chris and his Mother. By the end of the 12 hours of being there we were told we were approved for a 2014 Jeep Latitude. Perfect wasn’t what we wanted but that was okay it was new to us. And that’s were the worse two weeks of our car buying experience dragged on. We found out when we got the car home that Sunday that our temp tags were not legit for 45 days but rather 3 days. Than that Tuesday we found out that the paperwork we signed wasn’t approved and legit. 

Even worse, the 2014 Latitude couldn’t be driven due to expired tags, and Shirley and Chris told us to just drive it no big deal. Than they wanted us to buy a car (2017 Jeep Renegade Black) with Nothing in it. When they sent us a picture of what the car offered we found out we were “paying” for A/C, we were paying for literally EVERYTHING! And when my husband and I questioned it and said we wanted to see it first we got a horrible song and dance for 2 weeks from them about the car not being available, they couldn’t find it etc. 

My husband and I decided to go to a much more Service Friendly Dealership and literally walked out with a 2017 Red Jeep Renegade that had more options but also didn’t require us to “pay” for air conditioning.

Long and Short this Rockwall Jeep is a horrible Dealership and I wouldn’t recommend it at all to anyone for anything.",1.0

43,"August 08, 2017","I had the most relaxing experience purchasing my Jeep from here. I had a terrible experience with Huffines in Plano, and when I came here it was obvious I made the right choice. Go see Taylor McCloughlin if you need a Jeep. No pressure, very polite, and upstanding young man. The only gripe I have is with the finance department. Very rude and short, and need to work on their communication skills. When someone is about to spend the amount of money that a car entails, it is smart to be polite and curt with them. If I could remember the finance persons name I would post it. Other than that, great experience, highly recommend it. ",4.6
44,"August 07, 2017",Sam was extremely helpful! I called for service and he got me in the same day! He was friendly upon arriving and quickly took my jeep back for service. Sam is definitely an asset to your company and deserves an 11 because he goes above and beyond!,5.0
45,"August 01, 2017","We went in to trade our 2017 Toyota Tundra on a new Jeep Grand Cherokee.  We worked with Shirley Ribardo.  Shirley made this a terrific experience for us.  She was patient, found out details on any and all of our questions.  We had never owned a Jeep, so she had a few different versions for us to test drive to help us decide.  We were trading a vehicle that was only 4 months old, so not an easy deal, but Shirley didn't shy away, she worked hard and tried every available channel to get us a good deal on the Jeep Grand Cherokee we wanted.
Shirley is the optimy of how hard work pays off and a sales person that is dedicated to not just earning your business but making you a loyal customer.

59,"May 20, 2017","The dealerships  representative that we had the delightful experience of working with is Shirley.  Shirley is professional, knowledgeable and patient.  My wife and I went to the dealership shopping for a Durango Citadel.  We left after purchasing the Citadel and a Ram truck. Both new and both off the lot.  The purchases would not have been made without the guidance of Shirley. This dealership has a very valuable employee and one I will recommend to my friends. The new sales manager, Ben, worked with Shirley to assure we received the best deal possible.  He went over the numbers, understood our requirements and convinced us he was doing all he could to see that we achieved our purchase goals. Paul, in finance, is a very intelligent young man.  That was obvious very quickly in our conversation with him.  We may not have gotten the best interest rate on the one loan, the other was a cash purchase, but we plan to pay it off quickly so it's probably not of much significance.  ",5.0

62,"April 28, 2017","Bought a Certified Jeep Wrangler used with 20,000 miles.  Given a clean Carfax and promised it had not been in any accidents and received the certified used checklist.  My local dealer found front end damage on frame tabs and the alignment off during a recall repair.  Called Rockwall right away and was told they would fix or pay to fix the vehicle right but not take it back after a week of being passed around the different departments.  I also got yelled at on the phone during the process by the sales manager because I was using the incorrect mechanical terminology of the damage.  My dealer fixed the damage but Rockwall never paid as promised.  So I paid my local dealer out of my pocket to make things right.  FYI to future customers, Carfax means nothing, the certified used checklist/inspection is a joke and the dealer will not stand by it, and wear tall boots if you plan to do business with this dealership!  Update:  After a week they did send a check for the full amount of the repair.  Still a hassle and not worth the trouble.",1.0

77,"September 02, 2016","Internet Sales Manager Jason Burns was great. He brought up the vehicle we had inquired about and had us look it over. We then went to his office to get the process started. Very streamlined. Took about 2 hours start to finish. Would definitely recommend working with Jason if you are searching for a vehicle online. Keep up the great work Jason.

79,"May 05, 2016","I have little confidence in this service department at the moment, The service advisers (Ron and friends) are spot on, I have Zero complaints about how I was treated. I am not happy that 1 of my concerns was not looked at, but what happens in that garage is much more concerning and makes the missed concern even worse for me. I take my vehicle to somewhere for service, most of the time for mechanical service concerns, that creates an expectation where the end result mechanically, must meet minimum standards; this is what is most important to me. You can be as nice as you possibly can be to me, but if the automotive service that takes place in the garage is lack luster, then I will have to stop coming there out of pure worry alone. I took my vehicle for a number of concerns, this was a warranty visit for me, allow to be specific about my end result; one of my concerns was not documented what so ever (Possible problem with the radio), so as it ends up, that concern was never addressed or even looked at, another concern was a bad vibration at 80 mph, this was not realistically taken care of professionally. I get my truck back and the vibration is gone, but now it pulls hard to the left (from 1 issue to the next). There was no pull to the left when I dropped the truck off. 2 weeks before hand, I test drove this truck on a test drive, it pulled to the right, but they corrected that, they said it was corrected with an alignment. I subsequently bought this truck from them. So after this 1st visit to their service center for warranty service, which took 5 days because they did not have some of the parts in inventory. The invoice states that they rotated the tires and balanced them too (to fix the vibration). Why not test drive the vehicle afterwards, knowing there was a complaint concerning safe handling? I just cannot understand completely missing a concern I have about the radio and furthermore not doing a test drive after making changes or improvements to the wheels or tires, changes that would affect safe handling.",2.4

81,"March 15, 2016","Excellent service I have been pleased with their efficient service of my vehicle.  I usually wait for my vehicle, but this time I had to leave the keys in the night drop.  I was concerned about doing this, but it was no problem at all.",5.0
82,"January 11, 2016","The back story... After purchasing a new vehicle from Dallas Dodge my check engine light came on TWICE before reaching 1,000 miles. I had a HORRIBLE experience while attempting to have my new car serviced at Dallas Dodge. I left without my car being fixed or even looked at in a two hour time frame during my scheduled appointment.

I decided to try my luck at Rockwall Dodge. I scheduled an appointment, arrived on time, and was given honesty from the start. My service advisor made sure to update me during the diagnostic and after when checking on availability on parts. I ended up having to leave with a rental and pick up my vehicle two days later. I am a satisfied customer. I appreciate the honesty, communication, and excellent customer service I received at Rockwall Dodge.",5.0
83,"October 21, 2015","Brian Osborn took the extra time to diagnose and direct the repair of an unusual suspension noise.
Am very happy with Rockwall Dodge service. While car repair or just a simple oil change can sometimes be difficult, they go out of their way to please.

84,"October 15, 2015","Rockwall dodge service department always provides a hassle with their service.  I went in with a $15 oil change coupon that they sent to my house and they fought me to honor.  They said that coupon is for conventional oil, which we don't offer.  I explained how that was pretty tricky to send out coupons for stuff you don't offer.  They said we don't send those out, even though their name is on it.  They eventually gave me the price, but it is a shame they choose to ruin the experience.  I experienced very similar issues with the parts department and a Costco voucher.",1.0

87,"June 14, 2015",I had moved from another state and the dealership I went to previously did not properly fix my truck and were not clear at communicating the issues. Rockwall righted that wrong and helped me out tremendously. I appreciate everything they did and will be a customer of theirs for life. ,5.0
88,"November 20, 2014","Very honest and friendly service advisers. Was concerned about what to expect on my truck considering it needed a major repair.  We picked it up and it looks like the day I bought it. Every clip, clamp, hose and detail looks right. very detailed mechanic. Very knowledgeable & helpful service advisers. Got my truck back clean. The friendliness and fairness of the entire dealership is a good enough reason for me to not go any where else. To be honest, I'm a Hispanic truck driver from San Antonio and I went in there wearing old jeans and a t-shirt and was listened to and treated very nice every time. That meant a lot to me and my wife. We were needing another vehicle and decided to buy another truck here the same day. Best dealer experience ever. Thank you guys!",5.0
89,"September 07, 2014",I was greeted promptly and service advisor offered me alternatives right away. Repair was completed before estimated time. Great service with a can-do positive attitude. ,5.0
