0,"June 16, 2020",I went in to Brandon Tomes after speaking with Alauna Cassasola. All I can say is that I was treated like a VIP from the moment I walked in to the second I left. Alauna and her team managed to get me in the EXACT car I came there for with a payment that wont break my back. Me & my wife are both in LOVE with our new Genesis G70. Thanks Alauna and the rest of the Brandon Tomes team for helping a make a wish come true!! Got a feeling we'll be seeing you guys again soon to trade in my wife's car!!!,5.0

9,"April 15, 2020","Trevor was amazing to work with! I was a first time car buyer, and he was very knowledgeable, professional, and put my mind at ease. When a minor hiccup occurred with our first choice, he and the management team were prompt to make it right and make the experience better than I could have imagined. I’m very thankful for his help.

10,"April 14, 2020",Trevor was wonderful to work with though out the entire process and set me up with a 2020 Subaru Impreza thats exactly what I needed,5.0
11,"April 10, 2020","Responded quickly and we're very helpful. Trevor Lewis worked very hard to finalize a plan for exactly what we needed. Being pressed for time, he had the paperwork and car ready when I arrived and as I expected it to be. He was knowledgeable about Subaru and everything operating on the car. Absolutely no hassling me during final paperwork, sorry I cannot remember the finance manager's name. During the virus scare they had taken every precaution with gloves , sanitizer , and mask which I appreciated. Having drove a few hours to purchase the car the manager came out to tell me thank you for coming in, also very nice. Trevor followed up afterwards to make sure everything was okay with the car, would definitely recommend this dealership and Trevor to anyone.",5.0
12,"April 02, 2020","Trevor Lewis is the one who helped me out. He was super patient, informative, and terrific! Not at all pushy, didn't at all pressure me into signing anything. Actually, he helped me to get the Outback I wanted and he knew how much I preferred a specific color, which is pretty rare to begin with. Not only that, he also brought the car to my residence for a test drive due to the current circumstances. Trevor Lewis and Justin (the manager) were both awesome and we'll, let's just say they will have a loyal Subaru foreveeeeeerrrrr",5.0
13,"March 11, 2020","I worked with Rhyon Williams and he did exactly what he said he would do and put the numbers together to make a deal. He provided a lot of transparency to the deal.  
Very happy as Rhyon went above and beyond getting everything ready and seeing to it that changes were made.  He is very professional and makes problems into opportunities.  I would highly recommend buying a new or used car from Rhyon.
My daughter also bought a new vehicle from Brandon Tomes Subaru and has had excellent service work.

14,"March 09, 2020","As newlyweds, first time car-buyers, AND having just moved into the area, we knew we were perfect targets. After visiting 2 other dealerships where we felt pressured and sales-pitched from start to end, Brandon Tomes offered a HUGE breath of fresh air. 

We were greeted by Obiora Ezeh (""Obi""). When we mentioned we had several models in mind, he immediately jumped in to line them up side-by-side for comparison. He was genuinely excited to talk us through all the security/safety features and was great at illustrating the features to us during a test drive (including a parking lot demonstration). After thet drive and on our way out (without having committed to anything) we were introduced to the GM who greeted us like a friend, welcomed us to TX, gave us some local tips, and while walking away turned around and said, ""oh, by the way, we'd love to be the ones to sell you a car!"" 

We felt an instant rapport with Obi which continued throughout the rest of the purchasing process. When we had questions or concerns, he either answered immediately or found answers within minutes. He went above and beyond to help us sort out our paperwork and held onto the car for a week while we got ourselves to the DPS and returned our Rental. But the cherry on top was at the pickup: Obi had noticed it was the day before my birthday, and decorated the car with balloons -- SUCH a cute surprise!! 

We felt so comfortable with Obi and the dealership every step of the way, and would highly recommend them to ANYONE who doesn't want to deal with sleazy car salesmen or feel taken advantage of at the end of the day! ",5.0
15,"February 26, 2020",I had a great buying experience at Brandon Tomes Subaru this past weekend with Rhyon Williams. I purchased a Certified Pre-Owned 2019 Subaru Ascent. Rhyon took a ton of time to share all of the features of the vehicle with me and let me take a long test drive to make sure I could really get the feel of the vehicle in all driving situations. Very happy with my new Ascent and I highly recommend Rhyon to anyone looking to have an exceptional buying experience. Also while Rhyon was with another customer Sam also spent time answering lots of questions that I had. Thanks! Albert,5.0
16,"February 11, 2020",Great experience at this dealership made them aware that I did not have much time to waste and the definitely took care of me briefly. ,5.0
17,"February 10, 2020","Great car-buying experience all due to Obi Ezeh!  Obi was very knowledgeable of all of the Subaru models, is patient, and very polite.  If you are car shopping, make sure you ask for Obi; you won’t regret it.  Great experience!",5.0
18,"February 06, 2020","We recently purchased a 2020 Subaru Ascent.   It could not have gone smoother.  We special ordered and the car arrived 4 weeks earlier than the original commitment date, which was important to us because we had a long trip planned, and wanted our new Ascent for that travel..   Andrew and Obi both helped take care of us, handing off seamlessly between them if one was not available.  We had one very small issue noted after delivery and it was immediately taken care of without question or delay.  The entire process, including sales, was low stress, and low pressure.   This was probably our best car buying experience to date!",4.8
19,"January 30, 2020",Obi was great to work with. He had the car ready and reserved when I arrived at the dealership.  He went through the enormous amount of information of the new car.  Highly recommend.  ,5.0
20,"January 25, 2020",I've never had so many staff / salesmen ask if I'd been helped and/or needed help.  Didn't have to look for anyone.  Everyone was so polite and helpful.  I was all prepped for a sales battle to get a new car and it was so quick and easy I never had to haggle about anything.,5.0
21,"January 18, 2020","Obi, my salesman, was the most knowledgeable salesman I have ever dealt with in my 67+ years of life. There was no question that I asked that he could not answer off the top of his head. If I ever have to purchase another vehicle, I will gladly go back to him. 

Brandon Tomes Subaru dealership personnel were simply amazing! I tried car shopping in the Denison/Sherman Texas area where I live to no avail. The dealerships that I visited were very so-so
Interested in selling me what I asked for. I drove South 45 miles to McKinney, Texas and was blown away by the interest and professionalism of Team Tomes Subaru.

Thank you to Obi, Cody and the rest of the staff that made my 3 hour visit a success! I truly enjoyed driving home in a 2020 Subaru Forester.

23,"December 10, 2019","
From the moment that I received a return email from Brian Krenkel and he went to work trying to meet all my demands and expectations, (which I feel he was somehow able to do), to the time that I pulled up and saw my car sitting out front looking mean, clean, and ready to roll, the experience was easy, painless, and as far as buying a new car goes, enjoyable. They were not only able to beat all the competitors pricing on the car, but get it in the payment range that I was comfortable with. Brian greeted me when I arrived with a handshake and a smile, and was pleasant to work with through the whole process. He even took my daughter on a test drive in a Crosstrek while we were there, which is possibly her next car. The STI has exceeded all my expectations thus far, and is absolutely exciting to drive. Thank you Brian Krenkel for the service you provided throughout my buying experience, and your service to our great country, and thank you Brandon Tomes Subaru for hiring people like Brian who exemplify your desire for customer service.

24,"December 02, 2019","Curtis was very helpful, extremely knowledgeable and explained all of the features.
It was my first time to buy a vehicle and I was pleasantly surprised at the smoothness that the whole process was.  They truly made me feel like ""family"" --the entire Subaru team was FANTASTIC!!  Thank you all!",5.0
25,"November 25, 2019","Easy and informative process start to finish.  All of my questions were answered, all the features of the car explained, and I didn’t have to spend all day at the dealership.  I walked out a satisfied customer!",5.0
26,"November 22, 2019","We first met with Dana Hewes which was fantasic, very knowledgable and professional.  Afer a test drive we went home to decide about the Ascent.  We really like the vehicle and all the safety features.  We went back the next week and met with Eniqueso Reese (Nico), (Dana was on vacation).  Again, we were very pleased with the professionalism and knowledge with the vehicle.  Our overall experience was outstanding!",5.0
27,"September 25, 2019",MY POPS FOUND THIS 2019 WRX ON SUBARU WEB PAGE. I LIVE IN JACKSONVILLE FL AND WE TRAVELED TO MCKINNEY TX TO PURCH MY CAR. 1058 MILES ONE WAY. THEY HELD TURE TO THE DEAL WE MADE OVER THE PHONE. WHEN WE PULLED INTO THE DEALERSHIP WE WAS GREETED RIGHT AWAY. DURING THE DRIVE TO BRANDON WE HAD A FAMILY MEMBER PASS. AND IT WAS INPORTANT FOR US TO GET IN AND OUT AS FAST AS WE COULD FOR THE RETURN DRIVE HOME. THE SALEMAN AND MANAGER WHERE VERY PROMPT AND WE WAS ON OUR WAY HOME WITHIN TWO HOURS WITH MY NEW CAR. THANKS TO ALL AT BRANDON. LOVE MY NEW CAR AND IT DID VERY WELL ON THE DIVE HOME.,5.0
28,"September 18, 2019","I had my first service experience today, having recently moved from CT where my car was serviced by another Subaru dealership. At first, I was shown a pricing sheet with tiered options for a standard mileage service, which I have never seen at any other dealership. I was then told that my price would actually be about $50 more than the price noted on the sheet because ""these prices haven't been updated."" I should have walked out right then, but I was trusting the integrity of the Subaru brand. That was a huge mistake. 

I was also having an issue with a window, which I asked them to inspect. I didn't find out until checkout that I had been charged an additional $180 diagnostic fee for this. I was not told about this fee beforehand, nor was I told when the service technician came in to tell me what they had found.

My car was there for three hours and I was charged $730 in labor, which averages to about $243 per hour. I've never seen such outrageous labor charges in my life, and I moved from one of the most expensive areas of the country! My final bill was almost $300 more than what I was originally quoted. I've never paid so much for any mileage service at any dealership.

To say I was dissatisfied with my experience is an immense understatement. I attempted to contact their service manager directly, but got no answer. I also found that you can only leave positive reviews through their website. If you click on the link for positive reviews, you are redirected to Yelp and Dealer Rater. However, if you click on the link for unsatisfied reviews, there is an online form with no submission button. I did not get a good feeling about how they conduct business based on my experience today.",2.2
29,"September 16, 2019","Wonderful experience from start to finish. Curtis Iand Sam are very knowledgeable about the vehicles and makes purchasing a new vehicle painless. I didn't feel pressured like I have in the past at some Dealerships. This is my 5th purchase at this dealership and definitely won't be my last. All the staff from sales to service truly listen and put the customer first. If you are in the market for a new Subaru or used vehicle, highly recommend stopping in to see these guys. ",5.0

31,"August 13, 2019","My first Subaru but not my first car. Excellent experience. Thanks to Curtis Moore & Mr. Fowler for the informative, smooth easy process!!  This dealership will be referred by me with no hesitation.",5.0
32,"July 30, 2019","UPDATE:  Thank you so much for going above and beyond to make this right.  It is greatly appreciated and says a lot about the Tomes name.  Brandon Tomes owned their error and gave us a brand new transmission free of charge (labor included)!! We love our Subaru's (own 2) and will be back when it is time to upgrade!  Thanks again for taking care of our car!

2012 Subaru Outback-Limited:  Great car buying experience but WORST service department ever.  They gave us an estimate for a transmission issue for about $9k and then a ton of other maintenance recommendations such as bulb replacement, oil change, fluid exchanges, etc.  The total estimate was for $15,439! What an insult. Then 10 minutes later I get a call from the sales department saying its time to trade in your car.  We took the car to Ewing Subaru and got it repaired for $2000.  Wow!! My 21 year old DAUGHTER was the one that took the car in!  I am sure Russell Lilly saw sucker written on her forehead (little did he know)!  That says a lot about Brandon and Bob Tomes!  I definitely won't be giving them my business again!  Brandon Tomes can thank Russell Lilly for that!!! We will be buying our 2019 Outback Touring from Ewing Subaru!",5.0
33,"July 30, 2019","We were looking for a new Crossover, as we just rented a Buick Enclave.  I was leaning that direction, but had conflicting discussions with other local Dealers in the DFW area.  Some would return my call, some wouldn't.  When I told them they didn't have what I was looking for, they would try and steer me in another direction, and always ask ""What's your payment"", or ""What's your price"", wanting to only steer me into their inventory.  My requirements were simple, Crossover type vehicle, AWD, and at least 4500lbs towing.
Demographics - I am 59, she is 49, we wanted the same type of vehicle...oh and we have the ability to pay cash!  We live in Lewisville, TX and there were plenty of Oldsmobile and Subaru dealers within 15 mins of us.
My son asked what I was doing, explained to him what I wanted he said STOP!!!  I am going to give your contact info to  Joe R..  He said you will walk away with an Subaru Ascent, and Joe will take care of you.   But you have to drive to McKinney, 35-45 mins away.
Joe contacted us within 15 mins, and we set an appt to go see him at Brandon Tomes Subaru in McKinney, TX.  He met us at the dealership the next evening, I would ask him questions and he would answer.  NEVER pushed us, was up front and strait forward.  Gave us basic info on the models, and left the decision to us,  We had asked to drive the top of the line, I did a lot of research.  We were amazed, and couldn't believe the quality and technology of the Ascent Touring.  We looked at other models, Joe gave very detailed information on differences, never ever tried to sway us, just helped us to make an educated decision.  After discussion, we decided on the Subaru Ascent Touring edition.  One problem, we decided on a Blue, Touring, which they didn't have on the lot.  Unlike others, he went to the computer Found a Blue, with the exact specifications, made some changes we asked (didn't want pinstriping) and stated we should close on Friday.  Oh also included the Tow Factory hitch installed.  Friday, Joe drives to Lewisville, Picks us up, and we get our new Subaru Blue Touring AWD with Tow Hitch.  Joe brought along a new employ to give him hands on training.  He did ask me if ok, we didn't hesitate to say yes!  Joe was very patient and ran us thru the technology, what it is, how to use, EVERYTHING a person needed to know.   Never once did he try to pressure us, or tell us to buy another color, he got us exactly what we wanted,,,,and the best price ANYWHERE.   Yea Brandon Tomes Subaru and Joe ROCK!!!  I have purchased many cars in the past, and never ever was I relaxed and pleased with the competency of the dealership and Joe R.  WE will recommend to friends and family, as well as tell our story on Social Media.
Now to pay out, I specifically said we are paying cash and don't want to discuss financing.
We had questions on extended warranties, vs Dealer standard warranties,  Again very professional, with a funny personality from the finance manager Patrick.  We are covered for everything possible ""Bumper to Bumper""  for 7 years, 100000 miles.
Finally we loved the color, the gorgeous interior, comfort, cargo space, 3 row seating, HUGE moon/sun roof, technology, my Subaru app, etc etc etc etc.  Most of all what sold us on the dealership?  Joe Rigal and Patricki, who stands for the values of the dealership.  Again NEVER any pressure, just information for us to make an educated decision.  WE ABSOLUTLY LOVE OUR SUBARU ASCENT!!!!!  Joe and Patrick are ambassadors of the values of Brandon Tomes, which is impeccable and personal.   When and if we buy another car, it will be from Brandon Tomes.  With the ability to buy what we want and pay cash....as we are fortunate, we have one dealer and Sales Person that we will use.  Give em a holler!!!",5.0
34,"July 12, 2019","Kyle Shiraishi is an outstanding sales consultant. He did a great job selling me  my Outback.

38,"March 07, 2019","I never considered buying a Subaru until recently when I came across the high ratings that various review agencies were giving the Subaru Ascent. I emailed Dana Hews, a fellow Boston sports fan and he immediately connected me with his floor partner, Justin Bunker due to the day I needed to come in being his off day. I couldn't be more pleased with the product knowledge and professionalism of Justin and the management team as we tested the automobile and discussed financing options. The vehicle is terrific and we have had a great experience from start to finish. Highly recommend. ",5.0

Just want to say thank you for all the help that we experienced when my wife and myself at your store. I want to say thank you also to Sam Foret and Mike to their time to assist us there.

40,"January 11, 2019","They found the exact car I wanted, brought it in from 200 miles away and gave me a deal that other dealerships would not touch. Then the service department went out of their way to help me when I needed service. Truly an incredible group of people.",5.0
41,"October 22, 2018","I have never experienced a quick car buying experience.  And buying a car usually involves many hours.  Not at Brandon Tomes Subaru!  EB, my sales guy, was extremely responsive - when I asked for a few changes to the car's options, he had a new quote to me almost immediately.  I used my company's website to get quotes and EB was the only sales guy to actually send a quote; the others just wanted me to come to their dealership. Once I came to pick up the car, I had it financed and was on the road in my new car within 2 hours.   I will definitely return when I need another car.",5.0
42,"August 15, 2018","This is my second time buying from Brandon Tomes Subaru. The first time it was literally the best and quickest/smoothest experience I've ever had when it came to car shopping at the time. This time was even better. I came back with a tough situation, left Subaru a few months ago for a nice German car and had buyers remorse. So I contacted Brandon Tomes and stopped by the dealership to see what we could do. Within a few hours I left with a new car! What I loved about the process was that there was no flinching by anyone. Usually if you have issues with the numbers and financing there is just lots of dragging around. Nope not once here, they were just extremely confident. They just kept saying ""Don't you worry, we'll take care of you! You are leaving with a new car today!"". That's what I love about Brandon Tomes, they take care of you! So It looks like I'm Subaru for life now and I'll only buy from Brandon Tomes.

Special thanks to everyone worked with me (Ibrahim Yousif, Miguel Codner and Bernard Richa) for making me feel at home and keeping me entertained. It was great working with you guys!",5.0

50,"April 02, 2018","I dreaded the idea of having to purchase a new vehicle. I was very skeptical of all the dealerships I talked to, because of the stigma that resides with car dealerships. I still think that stigma holds true mostly. However, working with Patrick Varrassi at Brandon Tomes in Mckinney, I was impressed by how transparent he remained throughout the process. I had bombarded him with many demands, and he responded positively to all of them. More importantly he was honest, down to the moment of purchase. I was pleased with the Crosstrek I purchased at Brandon Tomes Subaru, and I would recommend other's at the very least to consider this dealership when planning on purchasing a new Subaru.",5.0

I bought my dream car (WRX) from them and it was 100% stressfree. Not only does this dealership have these 2 helpful guys, but the entire staff was very friendly and outgoing.

52,"March 12, 2018","I enjoyed my car buying experience from Brandon Tomes Subaru.  In the past, dealerships were so stressful.  With today's technology, working with this dealer made things much easier.  Started out inquiring on the exact Outback I wanted, but found out that it was sold that night.  Sam was my salesperson, and he found me another exact Outback and had it delivered to their dealership so all my add-ons can be added.  Sam was very patient with me with all my requests.  When I finally went to the dealer to pick up my car, everybody was very friendly and made me feel welcome.  You can't go wrong with the people of Brandon Tomes Subaru.",5.0
53,"March 02, 2018",Buying a car from Patrick Varrassi was basically like catching up with an old friend and talking about all the cool features of the new cars.

He has a great sense of humor. 😁 Overall it was a great experience and I appreciate the time and patience that was shown from the guys at Brandon Tomes. I will definitely be back there for my next car. If you are looking for a new Subaru Patrick and Joe are the guys I would recommend.,5.0

57,"January 20, 2018",I had a very pleasant buying experience.  Very honest dealership! One of the best dealer experiences I’ve had in over 40 years. And I’m very picky!  I highly recommend this dealership whether you’re buying new or used. ,5.0
58,"December 03, 2017","I'm not big on car sales people contacting me with their ""good deals"".  BUT I am REALLY GLAD that  I returned Justin Bunker's call!  Justin, the Brandon Tomes sales person reached out on  e-mail (I deleted them) and phone (I let it go to voice mail) only a few times in the week or so that I began looking to maybe replace my wife's 2011 Outback (nothing wrong with it).  

When I did pick up a call from Justin, a really PLEASANT PERSON providing GOOD INFORMATION was on the other end of the line!   Since it was almost the last day of the month, I figured it was worth a drive to Brandon Tomes in McKinney TX.  I did return to the FANCY SUBARU DEALERSHIP where we purchased our first Outback in late 2010.  The slightly longer drive to McKinney became a nonissue, as I found Brandon Tomes Subaru to be a FRIENDLY yet LOW KEY.  Justin gave me plenty of time to walk around the Lot & then when we met, he started telling/showing me a few things (that I didn't know) about the Outback 2.5i Touring we were interested in.

A short test drive helped me understand HOW MUCH BETTER THIS OUTBACK WAS, from our 2010 (quieter, quicker, more comfortable, better MPG, many more USEFUL comfort & SAFETY FEATURES).  The car also seemed to be a bit more expensive than our last Outback purchase. 

I'm sure this is a Subaru thing and NOT THE DEALERS doing. I also understand that as you move up choosing more ""gotta have"" options, things can quickly get pricey.  This seems to be the way all dealer brands  work these days.. The GOOD THING was that with EOM incentives and a REALLY HELPFUL sales person, I got the price I wanted with more features than expected!!

We finalized the deal that afternoon, WITHOUT ANY GOING BACK & FORTH OVER PRICE.  If you do your homework before coming to the dealership, it will be much easier for all parties.

So in just a few hours, we got the car we wanted at a price better than expected from a really nice dealership and a REALLY GREAT SAELS PERSON, Justin Bunker!!",5.0

64,"October 16, 2017","We drover 280 miles to get our Subaru and absolutely love it.  We had the best young man helping us.  I can't call him a salesman, because salesmen are pushy and he/they were not pushy at all!  We talked, texted and emailed for a couple of days before and they gave us the best price and made our trip well worth while for traveling that far.  They had everything ready for us to sign and the transaction was smooth as silk.  Sam even went with us to return our rental car and waited patiently while I did the return inspection and signed papers with enterprise. Mike in finances was quick with getting us up to his office and wonderful at explaining all the warranty options (especially in layman terms).Dana even helped link the bluetooth up for us.

The negotiation and purchase was easy.  Their starting price was a few dollars below what my research said would be a great price.  I appreciate a dealer giving me their best price up front.  That's who I want to do business with.  Bought the car the next day and was in and out of the dealership in under an hour.

69,"July 21, 2017","My wife and I had been looking at cars last year, and we happened upon Brandon Tomes Subaru.
At that time we had a leased vehicle that still had a year to run. We were treated like family, and due to conditions at that time we had to delay any new lease for a year.
This July we returned to the same friendly welcome, unfortunately the original salesperson, Tracy Corn, had to leave for family reasons , but we were welcomed  as old friends.
Our new sales person, Justin Bunker, was a more than suitable replacement. Justin really took care of us answering countless questions, accompaning us on test drives, etc. It was a real experience!
The staff at Brandon Tomes Subaru wer all exceptionally friendly and helpful to us, and they did make us feel like ""Family""'

91,"February 18, 2016","We went to Tomes Subaru in McKinney and Subaru of Plano. Both sales departments--right up to the sales managers--were unbelievably disorganized and unresponsive to our specific requests. I called Tomes first and after telling the salesperson that we wanted to trade our Subaru for another Subaru. I explained my time was limited and he promised it would take no longer than 30-45 minutes.  I drove there at my appointed time only to find out the salesperson had not followed through on any of the three things I asked: 1. The dealership did not have anyone to appraise my car as promised, so while talking to someone else, my salesman literally tore out of the Subaru dealership to take it to the Ford dealership for appraisal (without my permission.) 2. He had not pulled my car information or lease information on the model I was trading (in spite of giving him the info needed.) 3. He had not pulled the new model I wanted to drive up, so another salesman had to take down my request and search for a car to test drive. Upset, I went to tell the sales manager of my experience while the new salesman who had volunteered to help me listened. The sales manager apologized, I again explained what I wanted and they promised to get back with me. That never happened--until 5 business days later. 

In the meantime, we drove out of our way to Huffiness Subaru. This dealership may not look big and glamorous (who cares), but Mike Bresnahan did a great job in all aspects. In addition, the F&I guy was great too. This feels like a 'down home' type of dealership. We bought a car that day and drove it home. I will definitely drive out of my way the next time to Huffiness when I'm ready to buy or trade. ",1.0

They also low balled my trade in, saying there was something wrong with my transmission, which I had checked out at the Chrysler dealer and they said it was fine.  I bought a Subaru at Huffines in Denton, and they gave me 2k more for my trade than Tomes offered.  I live in McKinney but would suggest to anyone to drive to Denton to buy a Subaru.

97,"August 29, 2015","Don't be conned by their ""low pressure"" sales techniques.  The only reason they do that is to get your confidence.  (That's where the term conmen comes from.  ""Confidence men"")  In my own experience, everything looked good going in.  But when we tried to make a deal is when everything began to go sour.  Then it went from bad to worse.  The last I heard from them was a follow-up phone call when I told them I bought a Subaru elsewhere.  The sales manager then insulted me and hung up in my ear.  I'll never forget it.  The guy was just plain RUDE!!!

I've bought a lot of new cars in my day, and dealt with many dealerships, for sales, service, and parts.  It amazes me the really bad ones manage to stay in business, but somehow they do.  This one even got written up in the official Subaru magazine.  How they managed that I'll never know.

My only advice is to go elsewhere.  It is NOT worth a trip here if you don't live nearby.  Don't waste your time with these clowns for sales or service.  They're just too sleazy.",1.0
98,"March 30, 2015","We were in the market for a used Hyundai Elantra GT with a power driver seat and automatic transmission. They're extremely rare, so I spent weeks stalking Autotrader. When one in a color combination we liked, with low mileage, popped up at Brandon Tomes, we called immediately. Roger took great care of us from that point on.

As we live in Central Florida, we couldn't just go in and make a deal the traditional way. Instead, we sent 42 photos of our trade-in by email and did the entire deal by phone and email. It was a very easy negotiation and Roger could not have been more helpful. He was always available to take our calls, and answered all of our questions honestly.

We finalized the deal on a Thursday night, and Roger got the manager to agree to hold the car until we could get there on Saturday. We had preapproved financing from a local Florida credit union, and had to sign the loan papers before leaving for Texas. Our agent was a bit reluctant since we hadn't seen the car, but a speakerphone chat with Roger eased his concerns.

We arrived at Brandon Tomes on Saturday afternoon, and the car looked showroom new. It actually had 7k less miles than advertised due to the used car manager's error, but they did not ask for any more money, just congratulated us on making a great deal.

There was a small hiccup in the finance manager's office. They use a service to figure taxes etc. for cars titled outside Texas, and the service said our bank draft was $269 short. This was due to a fee Florida charges on first time registrations, but did not apply to us since we were transferring our Florida plate. Robby, the finance manager, was very understanding when we explained, but couldn't verify at 7:30 on a Saturday night.

So they took the bank draft and let us take the car to Houston, where we planned to spend a few days with family, on a dealer tag with a loaner agreement. On Monday morning, Robby confirmed that we were correct about the fee, and Roger emailed us a buyer's tag.

At our request, the dealership also corrected the mileage on the Carfax so we won't have any inconsistencies down the line.

I didn't believe in the idea of an honest used car salesman, but Roger truly is. The entire dealership was friendly, honest, and transparent. They gave us a very fair price for our trade in, and the car we bought was priced to sell. It drives beautifully, and we are ecstatic.

We drove over 1000 miles each way, and would gladly do it again. Roger and Brandon Tomes Subaru are truly top notch!",5.0

Second, I'm not writing a review on the other dealership we bought at.  I simply wish we could have bought our Subaru here, but we will likely bring out car here for service.

Over the next few months he answered questions by email and checked in on us from time to time.  Finally we went in on 12/27 to make the purchase.

We took a 2.5 hour test drive over rough roads, two lane roads as well as an interstate.  We also spent time in high traffic conditions.  The automobile performed far above expectations,  the ride was extremely comfortable and the radio system a delight.  This was the first car that we have owned with an in-car navigation system and front cameras. 
Upon returning to the dealership we purchased the vehicle.  

The sales personal was very helpful in helping us determine the best method of payment, trade in expectations and possible finance options.  We paid the difference between the 2013 and 2014 with a minimal output of cash.  I will definitely consider purchasing another automobile from this dealership in the near future.   ",4.8
