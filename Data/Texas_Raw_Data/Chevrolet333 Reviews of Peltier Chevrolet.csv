1,"November 24, 2019","My husband and I enjoyed our shopping experience and all the help we got from a wonderful salesman, Clarence Jones!!!! We traded our car and bought a 2020 Tahoe in record time and enjoyed the process. Thank you to the Peltier Team!  ",5.0
2,"October 11, 2019","Well, All I can say is that Peltier Chevy went WAY above & beyond to try to get me into a 2006 Corvette they have - sadly - due to my medical condition - instead of picking up the Corvette - I'll be shopping for a pre-arrange funeral package instead. My sales rep Kerry - was incredibly responsive - gave me his both his personal mobile # & email - the finance fellow - Jeremy was super quick in trying to arrange a finance package to fit both my budget & the crappy credit score I sadly have - all thanks to on-going medial bills - can't comment on the service side of the house - but - as far as the sales side of the house - these guys were great - just wish my lab test came back sooner sothat I knew what my actual medical condition was prior to finding this sweet 2006 Corvette which sadly I won't be able to enjoy - as - I honestly may not make it through the surgical procedure I need ...",5.0

4,"May 08, 2019","I would NOT recommend Peltier Chevrolet for service.  They are grossly overpriced.  They wanted to charge $1,100 for a/c compressor replacement which I got done at Donnybrook Automotive for less than HALF!!! I did use them for spark plug replacement and when I picked up the vehicle the check engine light was on.  Joe Francis (service guy) hooked up a diagnostic tool and and told me something was wrong (I don’t remember exactly what it was). I expressed that I was angry that they would let me leave with a check engine light on.  He started talking about how things can naturally go wrong and went and then went and got a mechanic.  The mechanic literally plugged something in under the hood and apologized that he had unhooked it while replacing spark plugs.  Really?!  I appreciate the mechanic for apologizing but again, WHY LET ME LEAVE WITH A CHECK ENGINE LIGHT ON! Joe did not apologize.  He did ask if I noticed any lag since the spark plug change.  I wanted to tell him he would see no lag in my racing out of Peltier Chevrolet!!! I have loved the sales team at Peltier (Julian Delgado) but their service department is a farce.  Never again Peltier. ",1.4
5,"April 30, 2019","Ok, the second to last time we were here was a disaster. We chose to give them another chance. It was worse than last time. We took the truck in this time to have the drivers window fixed. It would not roll up. They quoted us $460. When we went to pick up the truck. 

1. The window rolled up and down, sure, but it sounds like nails on a chalk board. 
2. Insulation was showing around the door panel and the handle. 
3. The cover was laying on the floor and there was a bolt missing.  

My husband did a u-turn to take it back. The service teck patched it back but could not fix the grinding window sound. He did not offer to fix the grinding sound in the window. Nor did he bring the technician out to see what he had left undone! The service rep should have checked the tech's job. 

Also on the bill was:
1. What is the $1.00 charge for ""Customer Privacy Maintenance fee""
2. 3.95 for Handling - what were they handling?
3. $30 Shop supplies - I should have received the left over shop supplies

19,"May 15, 2018","My family only buys GM products & we have bought an extensive amount! Of all the dealerships we have purchased from we always had to wait around for hours, tried to sell extra policies we didn't want,they would be aggressive,arrogant & we felt like cattle just being rushed through! Of 100's of dealerships we have dealt with all over Texas, you can't go wrong with Peltier! It felt like family instead of being pressured & a shady deal! There is not a better hard working, polite @ sincere gentleman salesman than Chris Kelley!",5.0

25,"May 12, 2018","A couple weeks back I decided to trade my 08' Denali for an upgrade. I received a call from one of the salesmen Chris. He said he had a truck for me so I decided to stop by.

64,"April 03, 2018","I had a great expierience. I came in for a state inspection while they were slammed with customers. I had my 1 year old son with me, (or my Crue man as I like to call him) his diaperbag, our lunch, and a couple drinks. My hands were full literally and figuratively. 

I had forgotton my insurance card and I couldnt get a hold of anyone from my insurance company. I started to panic bc I was holding up the line, had a baby darting towards a showroom corvette, and sweet tea dripping all over the place.

A manager sprung into action by holding my son with a fatherly touch, he gave me a computer to access my insurance, and a salesman even came up and dialed a magic number that got me to an agent right away. It was a family environment to say the least and I felt a WOW factor as my inspection was done in minutes after handing over my documentation.

102,"March 10, 2018","First off, thank you so very much to Kerry Corder!!! Best sales experience we've ever had working with Chevrolet. Watch out for those crochet needles! :-)

On to our story - we drove from McKinney after seeing that Peltier Chevrolet had two vehicles in stock that we were unable to locate in DFW after looking for several weeks. We simply completed the online inquiry form online and received a call from Mr. Corder within the hour. We arrived at the dealership and was greeted with a friendly smile from another sales associate offering to assist us locate Mr. Corder. After looking at the vehicles of interest we went to get a quick bite to eat. Upon returning we set down and expected to be met with the classic sales haggling tactics. ""Not what happened at all!"" Kerry's professionalism was apparent from the start. Kerry listened to our requirements for our new car purchase and helped close our deal quickly. We actually smiled and laughed almost the entire time. No high pressure sales. 

Everyone we spoke to was very courteous, friendly and professional. Financing was quick and no additional costs added just the exact terms discussed with Kerry.

Our only minor (and again minor) issue was a dead battery in the vehicle from sitting on the showroom floor for 2 months, but they replaced the battery with a new one fairly quickly considering what's involved in replacing a  Camaro ZL1's battery.

We especially enjoyed everyone at the dealership congratulating us on our new car purchase.

Thanks again Kerry for all your help and support!!!
And the entire Peltier Chevrolet Team kudos!!!",5.0

My wife and I really enjoy working with Cindy Roach in the service department. Cindy actually helped me while I was having reduced engine power problem while driving in  between towns in North Dakota she took the time to search and locate the nearest dealership so I could get it fixed while it was -25 degrees below zero out during the winter. My wife and I really liked the way Julian Delgado worked with us on  our purchase and was very patient, while at the same Dustin handled our paper work in a very timely fashion and Jason who helped my wife and I explained all the technical gauges and worked with setting up the HUD ... It's a great team at Peltier Chevrolet in Tyler, Tx and everyone seemed to make us feel like family!!! Thanks Everyone !!!

I had moved the pickup to the loading zone and to my surprise I could not open the tailgate. We were disappointed in not being able to load and depart for home an hours drive away. We planned on making another trip to Tyler just to pick up the couch in another vehicle. We would still have a problem with the tailgate not opening. My wife used her phone to locate Peltier Chevrolet, a local dealer, We drove to the dealership and entered the service area. I was totally surprised to see the massive shop area and the service writers in a bright clean well managed area. We were greeted promptly and courteously. After signing in and describing the problem we were escorted to the lounge waiting area. In a short time we were called and notified that our problem had been corrected. The time required to repair the broken part was minimal as well as the cost. We were very pleased with the service and cost. This saved us a return trip to Tyler in a busy schedule just to pick up the couch we had purchased. I told my wife that if and when I needed a new pickup, Peltier Chevrolet, Inc., would be my chosen dealership rather than a local home town dealer. I naturally assumed the sales force would be just as competitive as the quality of service. Thanks for the quality service.",5.0

A second female rep called me about another vehicle that I might (2010 Dodge Ram) like so she set me up to see Jeremy Barr (Former Marine and State Trooper). Had an issue with financing due to mileage. Jeremy recommended a 2012 Dodge Ram (that just came in) with only 68k. Just a little more then I wanted to spend but I love it.

288,"April 25, 2016","There are so many negative things that I have experienced with this place ,I will never buy from them or any Chevrolet ever again. I purchased a used vehicle in January 2015 during an extreme cold front with freezing rain and in the low 20s/upper 10s. I tried the a/c at the time, but of course it wasn't able to really be tested because of the extreme cold, but assured over and over again that it worked perfectly. Of course when it came spring time, it never worked properly and failed on multiple occasions. And of course they would not take any responsibility. Then I went back in with the same exact car a little over a year later to sell back since I am leaving the country. The KBB shows that they should be giving me at the very least $4,000 for it. They told me that even though I purchased it from them for $7,000 a year ago and it's still in great condition, they can only give me $1,500 because it is no longer being made. The car model hadn't been made for multiple years before I bought it, so they are fine with charging $7,000 for a car no longer made, but instead of giving anything close to the value, they would rather screw people over.

290,"March 22, 2016","On Friday the 18th of March, I called the service department and asked if the could look at my car before I had it towed to them. The service guy on the phone told me yes. Around 10:30, my car was taken in to Peltier Chevrolet. I called after work around 4 to see if it was checked out. The serviceman named James knew who I was and said he didn't get a chance to look at it and would have to keep it over the weekend. After work today, I got to the dealership and ask about my car. The lady at the desk goes to speak to someone and she comes back with a young man. The man tells me that my car is not there. I tell him that this is the place that  ""Crow"" towed my car to. Meanwhile, I am on the phone with Crow, asking what other Peltier Chevrolet in Tyler did they deliver my car to. The man is going on about there's only one car in the yard that is like mine, but it's not mine. I go all the way as far as describing every thing that is in my car, down to the money I left in my glove compartment. He holds out a key ring that is actually a taser that he took from "" my car"" and ask if I know what it is. I tell him yes, that it was right beside my BMW key. He still keeps going on saying that my name is not on the car. This goes on for almost 15 minutes, til the service man James comes out with a receipt of my bill for ""my"" car. The young guy never apologized and neither did the female at the desk. On top of that, my car still smells like something is burning. All the guy had to do was look in the compartment and seen the ownership papers with my name on them but he refused to do that. After clearly seeing it was my car, the woman at the desk. Makes my receipt out to me but puts Jr. at the end. There is no way, I could be mistaken for a male. Why the drill, when I could describe every thing in the car and the car was in the back? Just a random person, coming to a service department to pick up a car that may or may not have a problem. Right! ( sarcasm ) , ",1.0

Then I contacted Peltier Chevrolet and got in touch with Steve. He was the nicest salesman I've dealt with in a very long time. When I came in to test drive cars, he had the ones that I wanted to drive already parked up front. He rode with me in the car and answered all of my 9,000 questions. He was laid back, funny, and knowledgeable about the cars. I was very impressed with the service. I ended up falling in love with the 1st car I drove that day, and ended up purchasing it. Steve made the process fast, simple, and stress free. I also spoke to one of the finance guys named Cassidy (I think that was his name, but I'm not positive), and he was super cool too.

I'm a research kind of person and so far very impressed with Peltier.  I have called and emailed other Chevy dealers in different areas for pricing on similar vehicles and Peltier has been lowest so far.

331,"February 16, 2012","Peltier Chevrolet of Tyler, Texas had a dodge pickup for sale on the internet.  I called them and spoke to Kevin about the vehicle.  He sent me several photos of the vehicle via text messages and we communicated over several phone calls from him to me about the truck.  WE also communicated about the truck via email.  this was over a 2 day period.  this was the exact truck we had done a nationwide search for as it was a used dodge mega cab diesel cummins with sunroof and dvd which there were few made in 2006-08.  it was silver as well and this was the color we had hoped to find.

we put down a deposit of $500 via debit card over the phone on a friday.  the card was charged.  kevin told me he was taking the truck off the lot and would have it prepped for pickup on monday.  the receptionist spoke to me when I called that friday to give the deposit and she knew i was purchasing the truck by my name.  this is a very small chevy dealer in  tyler tx.  everyone knew this vehicle was sold to me at this point.  it was a cash purchase with no financing needed.

i was to drive down there and complete the paperwork on monday.  On saturday, david bates, sales manager called me at 5:30 pm.  he said there had been a mixup and they had sold the vehicle.  he was sorry and but they asked the other buyers to that had come in on saturday to give the truck back but they refused so he was going to refund my $500 and have a nice day.  i told him not so fast that we had a contract as he made an offer on the truck and i had accepted by giving him the deposit.  he said i was wrong and hand up on me.

i tried to call back for over 30 minutes but they refused to answer with the exception of another salesman by accident answered and in anger i demanded he tell me what happened and he said they had sold it to another couple that had come in. i asked for how much as my contract was for $18k and he said over $19 something.  thus, they had gotten another higher offer and david bates decided to trash us by breaking our contract.

I called again on monday and they continued to refuse to answer my number.  finally today on thursday, i called from unknown number and they answered.  

i first spoke to rebecca and when I identified myself only as the one that had put down the deposit on the truck on friday, she immediately called me by name and hang up on me.

spoke next to david bates after i called back.  he seemed to think it was funny till i told him would file this report and possibly file suit to try to get to their bond.

they owe me the difference in what contracted the truck for and what they actually sold it for and under deceptive trade practices act if proven in court would owe triple damages.

332,"February 08, 2011","We live in Longview but drove to Tyler to look for a used vehicle.  We knew our situation was not good, but when we got to Peltier, our salesman assured us that he could find something for us.  He instead kept running us into dead ends.  He had us drive to Tyler on 4 different occasions, and each time we left more frustrated than the time before.  We were NEVER able to get a hold of him because he would not return our calls to the dealership, and would never return messages on his cell phone.  The only way to communicate with him was driving to Tyler.  
He also lied to us by saying that they had bought a vehicle for us at auction.  He told us that it would be there Saturday at the latest.  We called him ALL DAY on Saturday to find out if it had arrived yet and he never answered.  We of course had to drive to Tyler to talk to him. He said that it had not come in yet, but that it would be there on Monday.  We tried to call him Monday, and once again he had not returned our call, so we drove to Tyler again. When we arrived that afternoon, the other salesmen told us that he went to Lufkin to pick up our vehicle. One of the salesmen were able to get a hold of him, and he tslked to us on the phone and said he would be back later that afternoon.  We waited around Tyler for 4 hours on him to get back, and when he got back, he said that the vehicle that they sent smelled of smoke so he left it there.  Then he went and talked to another couple who had the same type of vehicle we wanted on his truck.  (Another words, he thought that he was talking to them on the phone, and then when he realized that he messed up, he said that our car smelled like smoke).  I believe that he either did not get us a car at auction, or he sold it that Saturday before we got there.  Either way, if he had been honest with us, or EVER called us back, then it would be a different story.  Instead we make 4 trips to Tyler and spend over 15 hours at the dealership so he can blow wind up our butts.  
Monday evening, I was so mad that I wanted to quit my search but I tried one more place.  Longhorn Ford in Mineola, Texas was EXTREMELY helpful and understood our situation completely.  Our dealer was Jeremy May, and he had us in and out within 3 hours in our fully loaded 2009 Z71 Tahoe.  No problem at all!  Thank God for LONGHORN FORD!",2.5
