They also report to all 3 federal beareaus so anyone in need of building credit this is a must! Benny Boyd worked with me to get me into the vehicle I wanted and even found me a cheaper insurance agency! I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a new set of wheels:) ,5.0

14,"December 20, 2018","The plan wasn't to purchase now, but in March when things were ""better"" for me to buy. I was there to help my son with his purchase and ask some questions about getting out of some negative equity and into a stronger truck with a future purchase... wanted to set it up nicely. Turns out I didn't have to wait. Now I have a truck that will pull my heavy trailer and I can be in business in no time. Thank you Lisa and Rock! ",5.0

19,"November 20, 2018","We have bought lots of cars, and this was by far the easiest, most hassle free experience we’ve ever had. The staff was super friendly and helpful. We took our car for a trade-in and got a very fair price. We saw a car we liked on the Georgetown website, so they drove over there to get it for us and brought it to Marble Falls to test drive. We ended up buying it. Drove away very happy!  I’d highly recommend Benny Boyd!",5.0

25,"December 04, 2017",I am a first-time car buyer. The staff here (especially Jerry) helped me feel right at home and were very patient with me not having everything ready for buying when I got there. They encouraged me to test drive multiple cars and even offered to go over the inventory of other Benny Boyds to help me make a decision. They got me a great rate and got me in a car same-day. They made the car buying experience a lot less nerve-wracking. I am glad I chose to get my car from here. ,5.0
