0,"May 19, 2019","Where do i begin!! I was warned to stay away and not deal with them. But i wanted to support small business in our small town being a business owner my self. Our suv has been in the shop almost as long as we have owned it. The finance lady is the rudest and most unprofessional i have ever seen. After 3 visits in the shop to fix it, we still have parts falling off our suv and the light they said they fixed was not fixed found that out when we got pulled over cause our rear light wasn't working. This is all in the same day. We only own the suv for 3 weeks now.  Run and do not do business with them, i wish i would have listen. The salesmen are the only good ones there wish they were at a different dealer.",1.4

5,"September 01, 2017","It's a small dealorship but they are 'big' on service.   Everyone we worked with have great attitudes and treated us with respect.  The staff was very helpful in finding 2017 vehicles to meet our needs.  We appreciated getting good pricing early on and avoided the hassles associated with purchasing new vehicles.  This is our first purchase from Brian Toliver and it was a pleasant experience.  The manager, sales personnel and the support stall were all excellent.  We look forward being very  happy Brian Toliver customers.",5.0

10,"August 10, 2017","It's been a long time since I have even given a thought to buying a vehicle in Quitman. After seeing the support Brian Toliver Ford has given our Ag program and this community in general, I wanted to give them a shot. I couldn't be more pleased with the experience. Jason didn't pressure me and that is huge in my dealings with car salesmen. It was nice leaving the dealership feeling like I got a great deal and feeling like my business was appreciated instead of feeling like I had made a mistake and I was just another sale.",5.0
