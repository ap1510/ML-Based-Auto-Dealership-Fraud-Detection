1,"September 05, 2019","I just moved to the area and have a 2016 HRV-EX. Out of nowhere when I was out of town I had lights show up on my dash that were all related to the parking brake system and I was so worried because I was an hour away and it was a holiday. I showed up and didn’t have an appointment, not feeling well and on crutches. They were ALL SO NICE and VERY HELPFUL. They drove me home and not too long afterwards they called and let me know that everything was actually okay with it and explained EVERYTHING as to what caused the problem. And they came to get me at my house and I was able to get my car back. I was SO worried... but they were all just so helpful and so nice, and I just can’t thank everyone enough. ",5.0

10,"May 22, 2018","Went to Frank Brown looking for a used car I saw on their inventory. Was helped by Blake Silvas, who was honest and upfront about the condition of the cars and such and did not try to force a sale on me. Loved his patience and honest approach. especially in an industry notorious for ""tactics"" to offload inventory; this was a refreshing and welcome change. Though the sale did not go through, I'll certainly look to do business here should an opportunity arise in the future.",5.0

13,"January 15, 2018","So I will try to be as thorough as possible, I have been in the market to switch from truck to car as my driving habits have changed. I was interested in a 2018 Honda Accord because of engineering and reliability. I am an active duty military service member and have access to several lender's for large purchases and found a couple cars that met my financial need. Theres only 3 dealerships that had the car I wanted new Mexico, Lubbock TX, and Dallas, TX. I test drive at Frank Brown and really liked the car, the salesman Dylan was great (hondstly one of the nicest and sincere salesman ive met) and he asked me to give them a chance at a deal. I didn't care to make a deal as I already had my ducks in a row (already had secured financing and %) and the only thing to negotiate was my trade in, Frank Brown offered 20K where as the others had already offered 23K aight unseen. The ""Finance Manager"" Emilio wasted about 4 hours of my time playing childish games of ""let me see how much they offered so I can offer that, and what's their car price"". None of this matters, sad games to play on those who don't research. At one point I even heard them in the office say ""xxxx how many dealerships has he talked to"" which I guess they pray on ignorant buyers. After wasting my time the finance manager comes out and say and I quote ""looks like you're ready for a buy"" with a smile on his face and shakes my hand and then says..... ""Good bye"". ""You've wasted my time and my salesman time"" ""We have to feed our families"". I asked him if he thought his actions are a good business model for frank brown? No answer. I firmly let Dylan know the only way to resolve this is to have the owner schedule a meeting with me and have his manager apologize for his actions. That was a month ago....Not even a call.

To end this I will say please review all low star ratings on this dealership, on no less than the first 3, they all have one thing in common which is the salesmanager. I drove 100 miles away to buy a car from another dealership and will never return for any services at Frank Brown Honda. ",1.0
14,"August 22, 2017"," I'm now on my third Honda from Frank Brown automotive and I have never been more happy with my choice than I was today. I have an issue with my car that I did not know how to fix, did not think I could afford to fix , But took it  in anyway.  And was so pleasantly surprised when the service department figured out how to fix my problem with that charging me anything. I've been having a really tough time this past month through all sorts of trouble's and did not think I could handle one more problem that I could not afford! What loveLy people to help me out when I needed it most.",4.6
15,"May 02, 2017","I've always received good service from Frank Brown.  Rudy Cisneros has been very courteous and helpful and understands that most of the time I do the maintenance on my Ridgeline, but have had them do heavier maintenance like transmission and rear-differential fluids.  Their courtesy van driver knows the city and will quickly pick you up or get you where you need to be.  The same gentleman has been the cashier for as long as I can remember and is always friendly.",3.8
16,"July 27, 2016",We are traveling home from our vacation too busy to install a battery.  We still have 350 miles home still . No other dealer. Available to us.,1.0
17,"February 11, 2016","After receiving an urgent voice message from Honda to take our 10-year old Honda Pilot to a dealer in response to a faulty airbag recall, my wife and I reluctantly turned our car over to Frank Brown's 'service team' to make the 'free' replacement.

Stereo-typically, the Frank Brown service technicians took full advantage of this opportunity and proceeded to inspect and tamper under the hood as part of their responsibility to 'take care of us' --performing this unsolicited inspection, of course, prior to replacing the airbag.

The result: recommendations for around $3k in 'needed' repairs, including an oil pan replacement that had been averted nearly a year beforehand by our mechanic, who had found a minor leak due to a stripped plug which he managed to successfully patch at our request. Up until the expert Frank Brown mechanics got their greedy hands on our car, the patch had held up superbly. We had no oil leaks. None. Zero. And I don't think it was mere coincidence that the patch failed the very day the dealership performed their examination.

I politely expressed our dismay to both the service department and their fearless leader, franchise owner Brent Brown. Even though the story changed somewhat from the 'distress call' to my wife to my phone conversation with Mr. Brown, all valiantly stayed steady and resolute in their position: no adjustment to the cost of replacing the now useless oil pan. They were guilty of nothing but trying earnestly to meet their high standards and responsibility to their customers.

Of course, we had to immediately take the car to our mechanic to fix what Frank Brown had broken, but we at least had the consolation of not spending a dime with Frank Brown.

A very bad experience, and we will never go back to the this dealership.",1.0
