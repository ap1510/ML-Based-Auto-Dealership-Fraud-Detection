0,"February 29, 2020","I have been coming to this dealership for ~1 1/2 years ever since the dealership that I bought the Mini closed. 
To be honest, my 1st experience was so bad that I considered taking the car to a dealership 45 min - 1 hr away. 
But a new manager (Carlos F) started & asked me to give them one more chance... I was super reluctant but thought that I would be fair. 
He made sure that my initial experience was resolved quickly.
I‚Äôm glad that I gave him a chance to show what the dept could do: under the new service dept management, I have not had any problems. 
I am actually here on a Sat bc of a surprise warning light: even though I didn‚Äôt have an appointment, the service rep quickly took care of me & is working to figure out the car warning light. 
I would recommend using them or giving them a chance even if you had a previous issue before the new manager (Carlos F) started. 
Last year (1st experience), I would have given the dept a -5; now I‚Äôd give them a (positive) 5. ",5.0
1,"September 13, 2018","Your customers come in ALL colors. So, when they step in your building don‚Äôt pretend you are on the phone or pre-occupied. Ask them, ‚ÄúHow may I help you.‚Äù I stood there in your face and every WHITE salesman/ person ignored me. Poor customer service. I give thanks to the incredible black professional salesman that saw me standing there and offered help. I‚Äôm sorry I bought this Mini Cooper from you. I wish I could return it and I would never reccommend anyone to you small minded people. Also, I didn‚Äôt realize my miles are tracked by your system. When I called to schedule a service check... Why didn‚Äôt the person on the line informed me it was too early. I wasted gas and time. Customer service people and attention to details is an incredible thing...ü§î",1.0
2,"August 19, 2018","My wife was needing to schedule an appointment to get a scratch/dent repaired since we had paid for coverage on our lease. We called on a Saturday and it took until Wednesday to get the appointment set up. Alex Guzman (sales manager) was not interested in helping myself or my wife since it had nothing to do with a purchase of a new vehicle. When I told him that we needed to use our dent coverage, I explained that it was more of a scratch and asked if that would be cover. He said yes as long as it was not bigger than the size of a baseball. He said he would have A service advisor call me later that day on Saturday. I never heard from him on Saturday, so I followed up on Monday as well as my wife. I called Alex and he did not answer. I sent him an email and he finally responded. I was not available when he called, so he left me a voicemail and said he was too busy and didn‚Äôt have time to call back on Sunday. I called him back and spoke to him and he said he would have a service department gentleman named Parker call us to coordinate an appointment. Never got a call back on Monday. Waited on Tuesday and never got a call or email. I called on Tuesday and requested to speak to Parker, he was unavailable and I left a message for him to call my wife. My wife also called and left a message for him to call her. He never called back on Tuesday. I called on Wednesday to let Alex know that Parker never called. Alex did call back and spoke to my wife. My wife was frustrated at this point and explained that it had been 4 days since we were trying to get an appointment and no one seemed interested in helping us. Alex response was, it‚Äôs not my job to schedule the appointments and Parker needs to schedule it. I am trying to do you a favor by having him call you. Last time I checked, it‚Äôs the entire company‚Äôs responsibility to help the customer no matter the department. In fact, Alex told my wife that she needed to tell Parker that her being upset is Parker‚Äôs fault for not following up with us and it‚Äôs not his department to help customers who need damage repair. Parker finally got in touch with my wife on Wednesday. My wife was upset when she spoke to Parker and explained everything. Parker was nicer about the situation and was able to schedule an appointment for Friday. In addition, Parker said he had only found out from Alex on Wednesday that he needed to call us. Whereas Alex claimed that he informed him on Saturday. Friday rolled around and Parker asked my wife to send a picture of the damage. She took pictures and forwarded to him as requested. He responded and said the scratch was too deep and the whole hood would have to be repainted, therefore they could not cover it. My wife decided to go in anyways because we needed the car appraised. When the guy was done with the appraisal, he said he didn‚Äôt even notice the damage on the hood. Yet the damage repair warrant would not cover it though because it was too deep. Alex was rude to my wife while she was there and pretended to be interested in helping her but he was not. Ultimately, I would not recommend buying and/or having your vehicle serviced at this location. Go to Sewell Mini of Plano! ",1.0
3,"April 27, 2018",Timothy Gotcher  went above and beyond our expectations when my car began acting up on the way to Houston. He was patient and willing to assist my family and I in order for us to get back on the road. We truly appreciate the service that was provided to us. ,5.0
4,"April 16, 2018",My niece is deployed and I‚Äôm in charge of her affairs.  Her car (Mini Cooper) needed a part and I took it in to MINI of Dallas and they were amazing.   John Berry explained everything to me and even took me out to the car to go over a few things about the car that I was not aware of.   I was in and out within 20 minutes.  I have a Cadillac and I‚Äôve never received this great service with them.  Highly recommend this place.  Thank you very much!!!,5.0

6,"May 09, 2017","This dealership has no concept of customer service or ethical  and moral compass.  Purchased a car 2013 335is BMW with about 19,000 miles.  4 weeks later the battery dies due to water leaking from the windshield causing the fuse box to corrode resulting in multiple problems.  They requested I bring the car to them 10 hours away when the battery was dead, the windshield was leaking and the fuse box was corroded. Refused to work with the dealership in St. Louis to get the car repaired.  The windshield it turns out is not the original BMW windshield so none of the warranties applied, manufacturers or CPO extended warranty.  This was a car that was leased by this dealership, maintained by the dealership and sold.  After 3 1/2 weeks, BMW of North America had to get involved and replaced the windshield at no cost.  There was a remaining bill of about $2400.00. We had to call the insurance company, which should not have had to happen under the circumstances.  They covered all but the $500 deductible and $212 in charges for the battery that was pro rated.  The Sales person, Gary Aggas refused to take calls and help me in any way at all.  The manager, Tania Eubanks, pathetic excuse for a manager.  She says she does not trust the other dealers because they replace parts that are not necessary. Nice to know, right.  This is the GM talking to me.  SHe offers $350 only if I remove the negative Yelp Review.  They have a B- with BBB.  I have had to tun this over to them to get compensation.  

Going on 6 weeks of my time messing with this group.  ""Run Forest Run"" from this dealership.  Never had such a terrible experience in my life with a car.  ",1.4
7,"March 22, 2017","The worst experience a consumer could get once he/ she makes a hefty down-payment on car. This is about recent experience when buying a M4 convertible.

Their Sales manager is a pain there and acts like a ""Gangster"". No professionalism from this fella. Worst part that GM is a newbie and backs up her employee even when they act ""out of the line"".

FYI I can provide complete sequence of events (which is why I label them worst) if someone needs it to refer.",1.6
8,"January 22, 2017","I have purchased a number of new cars in the past several years including Jaguar, Mercedes and Chevrolet but there were no better buying experience than my last purchase at Mini of Dallas. Alexis Garcia is an experienced and knowledgeable salesperson and made buying a Mini easy and at a fair price.

9,"January 04, 2017",Great car and we live in Baton Rouge so we had to drive home from Dallas. Nice car and felt safe.......Samantha was great and bought the car and was home in 2 hours! I even enjoyed speaking to the Apple techs that also work in their office.,4.8
10,"December 30, 2016","If you have your car serviced at Mini Dallas you must work with Mr. Vincent Hudson. He's understanding with an open ear. He cares about you and your auto. He's very careful and thoughtful. 

My thanks to Vincent for always telling me the truth along with options in order to keep my auto maintained.

11,"August 17, 2015","This place is run like a scam operation. I took my car in for a state inspection, the staff managed to cause over $2000 in damage while it was there by jamming the front bumper over a curb, then of course refused to take any responsibility for it. I came in for a $25 inspection which ended up costing me over $2500, including a rental car, by the time I was done. 

Oh, and they took my loaner car away when their body shop was going to do the repair instead of the dealer shop itself. A total scam operation. Beware!!",1.4
12,"September 28, 2013","MINI OF DALLAS - Great experience! Bought a car from Jorge this evening. He was knowledgeable, easy going, no pressure tactics whatsoever.  Listened and provided great details. I've never had a better car buying experience. The deal was made simply and straightforward. NO smoke and mirrors. He even stayed late to help finish up the deal AND gave me a ride to my office so I could drop off my extra car. Can't say enough about how easy and comfortable he made my experience. I will definitely recommend MINI of Dallas and Jorge. THANKS JORGE!",5.0

14,"March 24, 2013","This will be my 3rd Mini to lease from Sonja. This is the first time at this particular location. They have serviced my previously owned Mini here, with great service and attitude. I special ordered this particular Mini and I love it. It is exactly what I ordered. The process was quick, efficient and friendly. I recommend them highly.

15,"February 26, 2013","I have bought six BMWs from BMW of Dallas. My most recent purchase was a brand new car rather than the program cars or loaners I have previously purchased.  I knew the model and color I wanted and was shown four cars meeting my general wishes.  In the end I got exactly what I wanted.  The sales process was easy and pleasant.

My sales rep showed me how the navigation, music, comfort, telephone and online functions worked and set up most of the systems for me before drove off the lot.

I keep coming back because I m treated so well.  Oh yes, and I love the cars.",4.8
16,"February 11, 2013","Just a warning to shop for add on plans while you shop for a car. I am happy with my Mini Cooper, but I was  ready to buy they took me in to present a whirl wind of 4 or 5 xtra warranty options I didn't have adequate time to think about. I should have said I would like a day to think about it and will come back Monday. It is perhaps my fault I succumbed to these sales tactics, but this approach doesn't leave you feeling good about the purchase.

We paid in the neighborhood of $3500 for a maintenance plan that some report buying for around $1200 and could have gotten a lot more for an xtra $1,000.

Reading online the prices of these options vary widely by dealer and all dealers have to honor them. Don't just shop for a car, price the cost of the xtra maintenance by dealer before you buy. 

If you return the car, the maintenance plan is not refundable, so its also incentive you won't bring the car back.
