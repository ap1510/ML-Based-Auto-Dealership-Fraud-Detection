0,"September 02, 2014","I recently ordered some parts from this dealer. I placed my order and I received an email saying when it is shipped it would take 3-4 business days. I ordered on a Sunday and expected delivery by Friday. I received another email Monday morning at 9 am and was told my order was shipped and the tracking number was enclosed. There was no tracking number. I gave it until Wednesday before I called their customer service to a quite the tracking number, they could not find it and after terrible customer service and being transferred around they finally said they found it and will send it to me. Friday rolls around and still no tracking number. I waited until after lunch time and it finally showed up in my email, with much surprise it said it had not yet been picked up from the dealer for shipping yet. I tried calling customer service again but was put on hold and finally gave up trying to figure out what went wrong. The package showed up late Wednesday at my door. First off the box was poorly sealed as one of my actual parts was pushing through the one piece.of packing tape used to seal the top. I immediately opened the box and found that they sent me the wrong part. They duplicated one part instead of two different parts. I read the shipping manifest and sure enough the manifest matched my order but the contents did not. I then called the Dealer again in the morning hoping they would rectify the situation and sure enough they did not. I was told that I would have to pay for the item to be shipped back to the dealer out of my own pocket and then again to ship the right part back to me. I was a taken back by this, as this is no way to do business or treat a customer. After a few minutes of trying to track down a manager the service lady assured me that a prepaid return slip was on its way to my email and that I would not have to pay for return shipping or any other shipping and that the correct part would be at my house on Tuesday.  Surprise it is Tuesday and I have not received the the package OR the prepaid postage to send the item back. This was one of the worst transactions I have ever dealt with, every step of the way was a struggle and the company should be embarrassed.  I will not refer anyone I know to this dealer to waste time or hard earned money like I have.",1.0
1,"March 03, 2013","Have purchased a Cruze, and Equinox from this dealership  before. The overall experience was great. my salesman Emiliano was very professional and never intrusive. When it came down to the down payment, he said, "" whatever you feel comfortable with,"" how many salesman will say that. Other co workers of mine have had similar experiences from this dealership.",4.8
