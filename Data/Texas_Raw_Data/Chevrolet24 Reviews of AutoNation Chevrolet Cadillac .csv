0,"May 18, 2018","Extended Warranty Fraud--Warranty Fraud at Auto nation Chevrolet Cadillac - Amarillo TX (806) 356-5600-- I purchased an extended I bought a GM extended warranty from a Texas auto nation dealership in Nov 2016, took my vehicle into the shop last week, I was told by GM warranty that the dealership did not complete my paperwork and the warranty in not good, dealership accepted my payment and I have signed/processed contract in hand.
 
I have talked with Finance department Johnathan, left messages with Abby in finance, talked with Kim in the office, who at first said that was nothing they could do and somebody should have contacted me and was sorry.   I have left messages with GM, Eddie, with no response.
 
When I called GM warranty, they advised me that the problem was with the dealership since they did not submit a signed contract, which I and the dealership has.  My truck has been in the shop for repairs that I am waiting for over a week and this is an extreme hardship.   Now Parts and Service Director, Terry, would not provide last name, said there was nothing he could do, but refund my money, yet no warranty.  I was told that they would refund me for payments, yet not warranty",1.0

9,"August 29, 2017","This has been the most terrible car buying experience I have encountered. I will start with the amount of time that it took to get phone calls returned. I was told numerous times to allow the salesman to talk to his manager and will call back in thirty minutes and NEVER did I receive a call back within that time, not to mention that a few times I had to call back the next day and ask what was going on. The service department was just as lousy. The bed rug was supposed to be reattached to the tailgate and had come unattached again before we made it ten miles from the dealership. The truck was suppose to be detailed and I received it back dirtier than I dropped it off. The only thing that appeared as if it got cleaned was the tires and plastic around the mirrors. There were new scratches on the passenger side of the bed that were not there when it was dropped off. There is still a groaning noise coming from the driver side suspension that after two visits has yet to be corrected. The truck was some what cleaned, if you want to call it that, and the bed rug on the tailgate is still attached after the second trip to get corrected. I did tell the young man in service that I will not leave my truck there again because I was still displeased with the cleaning and service that they had attempted. I will be taking it back once more for the suspension issue because I feel that with the warrantees purchased that they should be held accountable. Last but not least After receiving the first text message from my exwife, who I have been divorced from for over a year, tells me that the finance department needs a copy of my currents DL. I contacted them and informed them of the mistake and it was promised to be resolved and well epic failure again. I have now received four more texts, two calls, four emails from a woman that has no business nor interest in know what is going on in my life at this point. I have made four different attempts at getting her and her information removed from anything that has to do with my purchase, service or any other business that has to do with autonation and well I give up. I am open to any comments suggestions or critsism if needed a representative can contact me at (***)***-****  and I would love to talk to them.  By the way the survey that led to this review was received via email from my exwife on today which she received 8-25-17 after I had attempted to get this part of the issue resolved the last time on 8-21-17.

10,"August 22, 2017",The service department was very knowledgeable and Brad explained our options and the cost of each before any work was performed. He had our vehicle diagnosed quickly and kept us updated through the process. We were ultimately disappointed by the findings (due to an oversight by GM) but Autonation made the process bearable and had us back in our vehicle much sooner than we expected. Thank you Autonation!,5.0
11,"February 16, 2017",sales person agreed to 34000 for a 2017 silverado double cab rally 1. I was also going to  trade in my truck for 6000. Upon returning sales persons changed the deal sheet in order to take my trade for only 2000 after the rebates. He raised the price to 39000. He tried to run around his word of 34000. Attempted to fool me by trying to convince me it was the correct price multiple times. Previously I had looked underneath the truck and found some poor defective welds on the drive shafts and catalytic converters. On the engine the maifolds gasket where not properly put had  sections of it sticking out. Worst experience ever! Will not be returning or recommending!,1.0

16,"April 09, 2014","The service department at this dealership is awesome!  The mechanics suggest work that is needed for my car. The suggestions that they make are legit, not trying to put money in their pockets. The service advisors do everything that they can to get me the best prices for work that is needed. When I am in the Texas Panhandle visiting family, I wouldn't go anywhere else!!!

22,"June 12, 2013","Worked with me when car sustained overnight hail damage before I picked up. Found a GREAT interest rate. Both men were available to help and made me feel as though they really cared about my car purchase. Car was thoroughly checked over before delivery, even though they'd just gotten it in on trade. Price of car was slightly below book, even before hail damage discount. LOVE these guys!",5.0
