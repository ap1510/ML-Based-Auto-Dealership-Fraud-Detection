1,"May 24, 2020","Look for Paul Antony Garcia if you plan to buy used vehicle. Very responsive. What make him stand out is after i purchased the truck, he spent time under the heated sun to help me (moren like do it for me as he did 95% of the work) get my sport car on the dolly so I can tow home. The problem is my sport car is lowered so he helped figure out tricks to get it on the dolly. Took about 1.5hrs to get it done. The next day I texted him thinking the interior light of my truck doesnt work, he called me back immediately. In short, ask for Paul.",5.0
2,"April 17, 2020","NEVER again will I come here. I had $4,000 to give down and all I was looking for was a low monthly payment. All they were concerned with was having to pay for inspection fee and bank fees, not to mention they wouldn't even reduce the price of the vehicle I drove that had a spiderweb crack in the windshield. Take your money and business somewhere else. Even though I guarantee they need us more than we need them right now with this whole covid thing, they will not work with you in anyway shape or form.",1.0
3,"January 09, 2020","Took my Toyota in right on time for my appointment for a routine oil change, new wiper blades and an air filter.  Two hours and $160.00 later it was finally done.  I had to go to the counter and ask what was taking so long before anyone even bothered to check on its progress.  The car had not been washed, the wipers blades were so big they looked like they belonged on a giant construction vehicle, and no apology or explanation as to why it took so long.

I fared better than the lady next to me in the waiting room that had sat there for over an hour and a half only to find out they never entered her car into the line up for repair.  Then they were going to charge her well over a hundred dollars to hook up their machine and tell her why the engine light came on.

Never again!

7,"August 21, 2019","My family and I experienced the worst customer service ever!  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY WITH THESE DISORGANIZED, UNCARING, CONDESCENDING  PEOPLE.  My family was super excited to have found our next new vehicle so I prepared everything needed to finalize the deal.  Sadly, when I went there as previously agreed upon to pick up the vehicle it wasn't ready as they promised.  I had already spent over 6 hours the first day at Universal Toyota picking out the SUV and had been passed off from Ohannes to California Mike.  I was NOT interested in wasting even more of our valuable time and energy.  However, my family  wanted the vehicle we picked there so I kept my cool.  After another 4+ hours of speaking to yet ANOTHER salesperson, Jacob, no real progress had been made.  They didn't even offer my family water or apologize for the lack of common decency when wasting days of our lives we can never get back.  You would think customer service would be a basic standard when people are spending their hard earned cash.  All they had to do is have the vehicle prepped so I could be in and out.  The so called night manager, Reuben, said he would have the day manager, Adam, call me the next morning well...THAT NEVER HAPPENED EITHER.  They are all Worthless unprofessionally that can close a deal with a highly motivated buyer...horrible experience overall.  Stay clear of UNIVERSAL TOYOTA ",1.2

Jon Henry however, was beneficial, caring & concerned. 
 Bought the models most needed for spouse & self, but less offered than my hybrid was worth for trade-in of the car purchased from that dealership a year prior.",4.4
9,"June 25, 2019","I have never left a bad review but this place is the worst dealership I’ve ever dealt with. I will never take my car that we bought from there for anymore oil changes or any work period. I’ve been lied too and feel like I’ve been scammed. Steve, the service manager, said that they would make it up but after I already fixed the car myself. I was lied too multiple times throughout the entire process by David, the service person who handled our case. We had water damage on the carpets and it smelled like mold in the car. First lie was that he told our insurance company that the car was not drivable because of the mold smell would make us sick but after they got their money and them saying they “fixed” the problem, I called up there the next day saying it still smelled like mold, he said there was no mold in the car. Another lie was that for the oil change they said they topped my fluids off and checked the cabin filter which is crazy because I changed the cabin filter after I got the car back and it was completely black and the fluid levels were not even close to being filled. I have pictures to prove it. Another lie was that they said they washed the carpets but that was a HUGE lie because I cleaned them myself two days later and they were filthy. The water after cleaning was a dark brown color and I have videos and pictures to prove that also. On top of all of that after I paid the $2,400, they charged my card for another $20 a couple days later and disguised the name on my bank statement from Universal Toyota to OIS so I had to call my bank and they told me where the charge was from. This is a terrible business and I will never go back to them even if my work was covered under my warranty and the service were free because I don’t trust they will do anything right with my car. I even believe they would mess it up on purpose to make me bring it back for more money. There is a few other things that I wanted to say but this is long enough, they are the worst place to go for any type of service.",1.0
10,"June 19, 2019","This dealership won’t reveal the APR you’ll be paying. Mine was %35! Insane right? My Fico 750. They make money not buy selling used car by banking.

The used car I bought had problems. They said they’ll fix it before they sell, they didn’t. I brought report from firestone , to prove the problem, director mark said “do you know how they make money(firestone)”  he means car is fine but firestone lie to fix my car. Another mechanic told same issues and I’m getting the car fixed now.

“Director” Mark drove the car with me he did not hear the noise coming from front, obviously he lied. If you can lie good enough you can become a director at Universal Toyota. This is the only skill you need because it is impossible to not understand the noise is wheel bearing and struts related for a director of a used car part.

I said to Mark, I’ll earn $2000 extra money that I’ll spend to fix this car and you’ll loose $2000.

Thank God, my soul is not for sale for $2000 as some others.

By the way Mark had a very pleasant smile while he indicated he is the director not manager. Lier is a lier not matter the title!",1.0

17,"January 04, 2019","Recently purchased a 2018 Highlander Limited from Universal and must say up front, the sales staff and all the personnel I dealt with directly were terrific.  However, a few days after my purchase, in which I paid cash for the vehicle, both myself and my wife received notices from the McCombs Automotive Group, through Universal, that our credit had been denied.  Remember, I mentioned earlier, I paid cash for the vehicle, and have paid cash for every vehicle I ever purchased unless there were some huge incentive to finance for a month or two, paid cash for my home, could buy 50 cars off the Universal lot and pay cash without blinking an eye, and I am told my credit was denied.   If my credit is denied, I don't think there will be very many approved so don't waste you time.  Despite the very positive impression made with the folks at Universal, the one at McCombs Automotive Group have insured I will never purchase another vehicle from any of their franchises.",2.0

22,"November 20, 2018",The worst dealership i have ever had any dealings with. bought a used f250 truck when i went in to look at it it was being serviced. i told sales person i would come back next. he said complete check. so i stayed and waited got out there at 9 pm. drove my truck home. Transmission was not shifting correct took the truck back it was 2 quarts of fliud low i guess there service dept didnot do there job. they had truck for about a week must take a long time to put fluid in they called said it was fixed. I drove it and same problem they said bring it back in. They had it for 10 days called said it was fixed did the same thing called and said it was fixed. Truck still had same problem transmission is bad the put another so called fix on it they had truck 2 weeks called and said it was fixed. Picked truck up again had it another 2 weeks did nothing to truck. Now i haved owned truck for 2 months got new title from state. i have driven truck about 8 times in 2 months. Got fed up with there bad service. dropped truck off to get transmission fix and not them. So to sum it up i would avoid doing any business with them ever again.

36,"January 03, 2018","Drove into the dealership due to some vibrations  while traveling on a long distance road trip. I wanted to get my wheels checked and rotated. The initial contact with the service staff was very nice however this is where the service experience just turned into an experience of frustration. The first express service attendant said that their department didn’t handle tire rotations, I had to go across the aisle and get a regular service maintenance agent to get things started. I went there, the reception was friendly but this employee wanted no part in helping me and was told to return to the previous express maintenance agent because “they can take care of it too”. At this point I got the clue that no one wanted to help me. As I waited in line the first express maintenance agent looked at me with feigned interest and said “I’ll help you out”. However, the body language of this employee said otherwise. I stood in line for another 15 mins before the 3rd person decided to take my situation on. This time I was told that my car did not meet Toyota Care Basic warranties because I was over 12000 miles (my odometer read 12347). He then proceeded to inform me with emphasis that I would have to be charged $70 to get my tires rotated and balanced. He was telling me that it was what his manager told him to tell me. I decided not to go get my car checked due to the terrible service I received but not before calling calling my service center at Family Toyota in Burleson, TX and asking them for their opinion about my situation. They told me that’s not how it should’ve been no matter how busy it was and if I really needed it, to go ahead and phone another toyota dealership to get it looked at. Called Red McCombs to explain my situation and they told me to bring my vehicle over there and they would look at it. I left this dealership’s service center and before leaving the initial attendant had to apologize for the poor service. To the social media/management team of Universal Toyota, please rotate and balance the tires in your service department, thank you have a good day.",1.3

It was not, I was told it would not be ready until later that day. Why give options for dates and time of the dealer can't complete the work in a resonable time?

111,"September 16, 2016","I am writing this to express my complete and utter frustration with the experience I've had here. This place has been a nightmare and I absolutely REGRET ever purchasing anything from this location. I have had to make SEVERAL (~8-10) trips to Universal Toyota, and it seems I will have to make even more trips since I purchased my vehicles there in the span of 4 months time. None of it was for services to my vehicles. I live roughly 30-35 miles away so it has been a HUGE inconvenience for both me, and my wife. We have better things to do than to constantly drive back and forth to your dealership because of your errors. 

First of, I was apparently given the wrong license plates for my Honda by you. Seems that they switched the license plates that I’ve had on my vehicle with another vehicle, and I had to return them IMMEDIATELY. Mind you, I had been driving around in that vehicle for over 3 months time at that point. Imagine that… it took them 3 months to realize they had given me the wrong plates. This was only because the other customer complained about it when he noticed the error. I had an argument with a Bobby Garza at Universal Toyota because of this. Bobby told me to bring the plates back so he can return the wrong plates because the customer needed them as soon as possible. Why? Was my “correct” plates ready for me? Did that other driver already ""immediately"" returned HIS incorrect plates? No. What was the rush then? Was this other customer so much more important than me that I HAD to return the plates immediately? Did he spend more money there than I had? Was that the reason? No reason was given. I just HAD to return the plates immediately. My argument with Bobby Garza escalated because apparently I was wasting his time, and because he believed that I was only looking for something for free. I mean… excuse me for wasting HIS time, and for not cooperating as I should because of your error here. I finally agreed to return the plates because Bobby agreed to top off my gas tank to compensate me. He lied. I drove off MAD.

A few days later, I received another phone call. I was informed the plates I returned, and was demanded by, by Bobby Garza was the incorrect. So NOW…  I had to return the plates on my wife’s car. Imagine the frustration growing even more. ANOTHER trip to have this corrected. I had to wait an additional month before I even got my original plates back for my Honda because what's a month when you were given a temporary plate that lasts only 10 days.

Additionally, we never received the spare key made for the Prius we bought (~4 months now), per Bobby Garza. Why? Probably because you bunch at Universal Toyota do not care in the slightest for your customers at all. 

It took over 3 months just to get the spare key for my pre-owned Honda. Robbie Vasquez was our salesperson, but he was the least helpful guy once you signed off on the vehicles. You never could seem to reach him. Texting, calling, emailing… nothing got through. I finally got my spare for my Honda after 3 months of waiting. He had promised to have it mailed out multiple times, and each time broke that promise. I asked him to mail out that spare key prior to us coming in again, and he stated he would not because we were going to be there again anyway. Rude, right? Should I be surprised anymore at this point at how bad Universal Toyota’s customer service is? I shouldn’t, but I keep getting surprised at how bad they are each time I am mistreated. I even spoke with a “Shauna Sewinkski(?)”, another high ranking individual there at that location, and was promised to compensation for all the trips in the form of a gas card. Guess what? No gas card. Lied to AGAIN. Voicemails and messages go un-responded, and emails are returned because the email address I was given was incorrect.

You guys were rated highly. That was the reason why we made the initial trip out there, and bought 2 vehicles from you there at Universal Toyota. I am EXTREMELY disappointed in the service and the lack of care that I have received from you all. At this point, I just want all of this to be over. Unfortunately, that is not the case because there is ANOTHER trip we have to make in the near future to correct being talked to the Supreme Maintenance plan because it will cover “ALL MAINTENANCE at ANY LOCATION owned by Red McCombs including oil changes”. Another LIE. You lot are DESPICABLE, and should be ashamed at how you treat people.  I want the spare key to our Prius, I want the gas card I was promised, and I want NOTHING more to do with our salesperson, Robbie Vasquez, Bobby Garza, or this “Shauna Sewinkski(?)”. Your salespeople there seemed like they are only in it for the sales, and that was it. Once we signed the papers, and are now the owners, they're done with you

EVERYONE NEEDS TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS DEALERSHIP!!",1.0
112,"August 29, 2016","My wife and me have bought 3 vehicles from Universal Toyota over the last several years and we have been very happy with them until we bought the last one. 
My wife traded in her “old” Toyota with personalized license plates and was in the understanding, that Universal Toyota would order the personalized license plate as she had on the old vehicle. Today (One month after purchase), after talking with them several times by phone, text and e mail I was told, that it was probably easier if we would go to the tax office and do it ourselves. They were passing us during that time from one person to the other.
We are frustrated and not happy with them at all and will go to a different Toyota Dealership in the future.

You won't believe what a blessing it was to receive the phone call from Paul Garcia on Friday morning. We had made a deal with another dealership. After driving in from Midland TX, we find out they didn't disclose information until we were in Austin to pick up the truck and the deal fell through.
Though we were skeptical to drive another hour and half to Universal Toyota, Paul certainly made it worth our while. Paul's partner Gregg Joseph took us for a test drive and explained the features of the Toyota truck while Paul had our trade in appraised. We loved Mark Hanna the finance guy too.

We were both disappointed and ready to leave, but Gabriel Aguilar was determined to help me find a car.  He was very polite and helpful; not at all aggressive and in my face.

I told them that I got it serviced at Universal Toyota, so they suggested I go back and have it serviced by them and then to have it rechecked by San Marcos Toyota. So, I did just that. Went to the service department and told them about the over tightened oil plug and they assured me that they would get to the bottom of the problem. They came back saying that all was well and there was no problems the plug. So, I went back to San Marcos to have them look it back over at the work that Universal Toyota had done and found out that they totally cross threaded the plug and that they had to take it completely out with a wrench, it completely ruined the oil pan.

123,"November 29, 2014","Worst car buying experience I ever had. First, no one approaches you when you walk in the door, you have to find someone to help you. Once you find someone and inquire about a car they have to call someone and make you wait for that person. I personally waited on several occasions for over 30 minutes just to talk to someone about purchasing a car. Once you find someone to actually help you they treat you like an idiot and lie through their teeth. For example, online they advertised a used 2014 Yarius ""automatic"" for 12,995. When I get there they inform me that it was mistake on the advertisement and that the car is actually manual. I then inquired about the 2015 Toyota Corolla L for 15,995 and David Roberts (salesman) informed me that it was only for one car they had in stock and they already sold it. I informed him that the advertisement states for all new 2015 Corolla L in stock, I even pulled up the webpage and showed him. I understand trying to make a profit but it doesn't help to lie to your customer. It was clearly a violation Texas Deceptive Trade Practice Law by advertising a product and then lying to the customer to avoid selling it to them at that price. Once I finally got them to agree to sale it at that price I get into the finance room. Its no better there either, when you politely decline their extended warranty they get very aggressive and outright rude if you continue to decline, a female who claims to be the financial sales manager stated that every person that touches your car is a master mechanic and they pay them over 196 an hour just to work on your car and by not having the coverage I can expect to be charged that much per hour just in labor. I then asked ""you have master mechanics changing oil too? And she said yes. So I stated ""you have no apprentice or journeyman mechanics"" and she responded ""no, all mechanics are certified Toyota Master Mechanics"". I can't believe how they insult their customers intellegence. I would never pay a labor rate of nearly 200 an hour for routine maintenance. She then moved on to finance and stated that they only way I can get the car for that price is if I buy the extended warranty and tire plan, I said ""no"" and she then said that she can offer me the car for the already agreed to price if I finance at 7.0%, I then stated that I have already been pre-approved by my bank at 1.95% since I had over 750 credit score and good income. She then stated that she can match that but I would have to buy the extended warranty. I was just shocked by what she was saying, at this point it was well passed midnight and stated that I will finish up the paper work tomorrow because I had to be at work in four hours and needed some sleep. They were very upset with that and stated the car might be gone by tomorrow, I said ""well lucky for me you have over 10 in stock"". The next day I come by to finish up paper work after work the person doing the finance portion of the car paperwork already went home for the day even though I called ahead and letting them know I would be by. They said only the person that originally started the paper work can finish it and my paper work was behind a locked door. The salesman stated ""I thought you wouldn't be back"", I said ""I called ahead why wouldn't I be back?"". So I had to come in the next day, she wasn't there again even though I confirmed by appointment that morning that I will be by after work to finish paper work, so I insisted that someone else  do the finance paperwork. The salesman stated that since we are starting the paperwork over they will need to run my credit again even though they just ran it two days prior. I stated the one you have is still good and you don't need to ding my credit by pulling it again. He said that the manager insisted I have it run again, and I stated get it from my other paperwork and he stated the door is locked and they don't have access. I then stated that I will be leaving and the salesman stated ""oh wait we have a copy with the other sales manager let me get it"". I should of just left then and there because this was getting beyond unprofessional. ",1.5

Patrick McNeil listened to my story and really did everything in his power to provide me with what I needed.  He went above and beyond to help me.  I really do appreciate all that he did for me.  He helped me when I really needed some help.  I love my new, used, car! 
Thanks,
Cindy Henkel

128,"May 29, 2014"," Horrible, just received word from corporate that Christine, the used ""pre owned"" salesperson, never turned in our paperwork. She was very rude, kept playing the bait and switch game. Even had to roll her eyes. WTH? I would never go back never again. hope she gets fired along with the used sales manager, horrible experience. Never again... Ended up walking away after they hit the credit report more than three times. Deal never completed, never would tell us the exact whole dollar amount, come on......now! BTW: STAY AWAY FROM NOE HERRERA IN NEW, he just gives you the run around as well!

129,"May 12, 2014","My husband and I put a down payment down for a 2008 mercedes c300. We sat at the dealership for hours while they did their ""work"". Once we were approved, we signed all the paper work and took the car home believing everything was taken car of and the car was ours. Literally 3 weeks later the finance manager calls my husband asking him about something on his pay stub. My husband and I are confused bc we were under the impression all that had been submitted to the bank therefore we were approved and it was taken care. (Considering we signed stuff from the lender capital one with our payment due date etc.) Following Saturday the ""sales manager"" calls with a horrible attitude insisting we bring the car back and saying he can have the car taken from us. My husband said ""no my wife is at work with the car and we will be there Monday to discuss whatever your problem is."" We go there Monday and want nothing to do with this place because overall I felt like they were scamming us I've never in my life had a dealership sign paperwork with their customer, accept the down payment have them drive off and almost another later harass them. We gave them back the car and got our down payment back but now in the mail I'm continually receiving letters from all these different banks saying I'm approved but it's expired. Makes zero sense. I just want to make everyone aware of their shady business they run.  Do not waste your time with unprofessional, jerks. ",1.0
130,"April 25, 2014",Was lied to about cars had. Drove over almost an hour and told was sold. Offered a car twice the price instead. Waste of time and will never use them. Horrible to do to a family with 3 small children,1.6
131,"March 02, 2014","My wife has been trying to find a new 2014 Toyota 4Runner in the San Antonio Tx. area for some time now. Her experience at Universal Toyota pretty much mirrors what she ran into at Toyota of Boerne. She tried North Park Toyota and couldn't get a realistic price. Red McCombs ended up wasting her time - another story I'll post at that sites rating area. She has yet to go to Alamo Toyota or Cavender Toyota, but I suspect she'll run into the same thing there. 
Universal had 3 4Runners online that were listed as being ""In Stock"". That means they have the vehicle. When she got there all 3 were ""not available"" at Universal Toyota? She was told they could get what she wanted, but the 4Runner was at another dealership. Turns out it was at McCombs which by the way owns Universal Toyota. Universal told her it would take a day or so to get it. A day later Universal told her she needed to come in and pay a $500 deposit in order for Universal to acquire the vehicle from McCombs. She did that just before closing one evening, driving all the way from Boerne. The salesman said it would be on the lot early afternoon the next day. The following day she received no communication. She was to go to Universal Toyota at 5pm and close the deal. She had not heard from them all day, so she thought it best to call before driving out there. Lo an behold, the 4Runner Universal was supposed to have was not to be seen. Their new story was they could not get it. She then had to stop pay the $500 deposit which wasn't a big issue as she works for the bank it was drawn on, but time out of her life nonetheless.  
Beware people. If a dealer in San Antonio Tx or nearby tells you that they are going to have to obtain the car from another dealer, get up and leave. The term for this is ""dealer trade"".  It's not going to happen. The dealer holding the car knows someone wants it and isn't going to give it up, If what you want is not on the lot, you are not going to get it from that dealership. Get up and walk away and keep looking until you find a dealership that actually has the car on their lot. ",2.0
132,"February 13, 2014","Dan really cares about his customers. You get a real vibe from him that he is there to help you and inform you of your options and not make it feel like he's trying to make money off of you or that your just a customer, he makes you feel like family. Dan also is very knowledgable and doesn't promise anything that he can't uphold. If he says something is going to happen it happens. He also was very good on follow up calls to ensure everything was good. He doesn't call to beg for referals like most, he calls to ensure that I am satisfied and if there is anything he can help my with on my purchase.
He is a great guy, he served our country and is very interested in your needs instead of his own or what his bosses say to do. I highly recommend speaking with him if you are in the market for a vehicle. Weather it may be a new Toyota or a preowned vehicle. He treats you right, with honesty and the way you would treat your own family.
With all of that the only problems I had was with the finance guy named Matt. If it wasn't for the amazing experience and relationship I established with Dan, I might have gone elsewhere. But Dan appologized for the expierence I had in financing and made up for it.. If you have the same issue in finance he truly will above what he needs to, to correct the problem and make you feel good about your purchase.",5.0
133,"February 13, 2014","I went to get buy a car.  I asked for them to beat the other dealership s price.  The salesman said, if I were you I'll go and get it at other dealership.

134,"November 09, 2013","We agreed to purchase a Toyota Prius the car under three terms: 1) touch up scratches on front and rear bumper; 2) replace missing hatch cover; 3) fix small dings in back bumper.  I have owned the car for two months now and still they have not completed what they said they would do.  TERRIBLE customer service after the sale.  I went down to San Antonio (an hour and a half drive) to have the work completed.  I had confirmed my appointment that morning.  When I got down there, the guy who does the body work wasn't there.  They did do the touch up paint work (did a very inadequate job) and replaced the hatch cover (clearly used with black streaks of oil on it).  I have tried to return to get the dents pulled out of the bumper and they keep canceling saying that the body guy is not available.  DO NOT BUY A CAR HERE AND EXPECT GOOD POST SALE SERVICE.  ",2.4
135,"September 08, 2013","After a ROTTEN EXPERIENCE at Red McCombs Toyota (please see my review there.), I went to Universal Scion. I had tested there a few weeks ago and was helped by Gregg Joseph, who was amazing. Gregg immediately recognized me when I arrived there for my second visit and asked if I wanted to test drive again. I was upfront and told him that I was there to buy. Gregg was not able to help at that time as he had another customer, so he passed me to Iker Fernandez. Iker was also incredible. He took me on another test drive and also showed me that the premium audio was already equipped with navigation and didn't need a $1,700 upgrade that Red McCombs had earlier claimed. When Iker took me inside, he wrote down the four accessories I wanted and then went to order it in. Iker returned to clarify EXACTLY which kind of spoiler I wanted and even walked me to different tCs to see the different spoilers available, which I thought was great. After trying to find a car, he returned to me and stated that I would have to wait until the first week of September to get it. I stated that I didn't mind at all. Since he didn't have a VIN of my car, he still went ahead and drew up my numbers so I knew what I would be paying for the car when it arrived. It was EXACTLY what I wanted, nothing else added to it!! I later returned to Universal on 6 September to pick up my car.  Iker was again fantastic and had my paperwork ready to go.  Except for a small glitch on my end with the insurance portion, I was in and out of the dealership in an hour and a half and had no major surprises thrown at me at the last minute. Special thanks again to Gregg who still remembered me when I returned as well as a nice saleswoman named Ivette. Ivette had met me while shopping the first time I was there and still came by to say Hi the following times I returned.  Not bad for a woman who had nothing to do with my sale and it says alot about the culture that Universal Toyota breeds with its employees. My experience in Universal Scion was no doubt what USAA/TrueCar.com intended on me going through and it really says something about the dealership that chose to treat me well without the partnership of USAA orhttp://TrueCar.com!!  You'd better believe that I will send every friend I know that wants to buy a car to Universal and even tell them which salesmen to go see! I think USAA/TrueCar.com needs to change the preferred dealer to them and drop Red McCombs Scion. Red McCombs does nothing but smear both USAA and TrueCar.com's name.

136,"August 18, 2013","We went to the Nissan Dealership ready to buy a 2014 pathfinder. after all was said and done we were $500 apart and they would not budge. So i did what any former car salesman would do. I told them have a great day and walked out. we were on our way home when we were driving by the toyota dealership. we decided to stop in and look at the highlanders. my wife's #3 pick. they drove ok, but a 4runner caught my eye. we looked at it, and test drove one and Yevette was  very helpfull. i explained to her that i used to sell cars and walked out from the nissan dealership a couple blocks away for being $500 away on the deal a few min ago. we ran the numbers on the 4runner and were able to meet in the middle we were very close on the numbers even though the 4Runner was more  than the pathfinder. we purchased the 4Runner and paid more than we would have for the nissan. just goes to show that  great customer service is better than a good price. We will be going back to get my truck from Yevette because there was no hidden agenda, no lies just the price and quaility service.",4.6
137,"April 02, 2013","I was recommended by a coworker of mine.  I was going to take my car to Red Mcombs.  I did my appointment over the phone, I was taken to my advisor.  He just stared, I greeted him first and then said why I was there. I should have just walked away first instinct.  I was quoted for a major repair and he said he would quote me on my breaks as well, ""there was a coupon"", he said.  When he gave me the total I asked about the break special, he said oh I can give you 10% but, no rental.  I needed the car, so I opted out of breaks. I was upset of course.  I was called early the next day about my car being ready.  I paid without hesitation, got charged for major repair and inspection.  Few days later an officer mentioned my expired inspection?? Yes, no inspection.  I called Universal, no apology.  I was asked about coming in.  I got there waited 1 1/2 and no apology. I guess they don't really care about keeping a customer.  I am not going back.",1.4
138,"October 29, 2012","The salesman I worked with was fabulous but the sales manager killed the deal for him. He personally quoted me a number, I was in the process of texting a friend about the deal so I know I wasn't imagining the numbers. When I went to finance to sign everything the numbers did not at all match up. I felt uncomfortable and like I was being screwed over. It took forever for them to give me back my drivers license so I could leave. They blamed it on a miscommunication but I feel if I hadn't questioned what was on the paper they would have gotten away with having me pay more than agreed upon. Then after I left they called and the price magically dropped. Customers shouldn't have to storm out for numbers to go down. There are far too many dealerships in the area to deal with this one.

140,"September 04, 2012","I purchased a new Tundra on the 9th of August.  My salesman told me that SiriusXM was in the truck already and all I had to do was activate it. When  I brought the truck back to have the Real Deal package completed, they tell me that there is additional hardware required to have the SiriusXM to work.  Additionally he and the Customer Relations Manager told me that this kit will take anywhere between 1 to 6 months to get in stock.  Knowing that Toyota would not do that I did some research.  I found out that not only was the part available, every other dealership in the San Antonio area told me it was in stock and available.  After I confronted the personnel at Universal Toyota passed the buck and she said, ""They didn't send out a bulletin to announce the availability.""  I guess that they were the only dealership in the area to not get that memo.  Now yesterday I get a call from the business office, telling me that I need to contact the lien holder of my trade in and have them send a copy of my title before Universal Toyota can payoff my truck.  Now remember I purchased the truck on the 9th and they didn't get back with me till the 23rd, 14 calender or 10 business days later.  When I contacted the General Manager he wrote, ""We requested this copy from Ally on the 10th of August(a friday)and they assured us that it would be sent within 48-96 business hours. When we did not receive this copy within their specified time frame, we called back and the bank notified us that unless the customer called them to request this copy they would not release it. Without this copy we cannot issue a payoff check. Ally misinformed us and thus the delay.""  OK, the Bank told him that it was going to take 6 to 12 days to fax it back, really?  They told me 2 to 4 days. That means the allotted time expired on the 16th.  And they didn't call me till the 23rd.  It took Ally bank an hour to send it.  The topper to all of this is that the dealership placed the temp tag in the window when TX state law requires it on the bumper.  The Selma Police department informed me of the when they pulled me over.

Universal Toyota does everything it can to pass the blame onto others.  The quotes are directly from emails that I have received from personnel at Universal Toyota.  With all of my research and hassle that I have gone through, you think that they would offer me some sort of compensation, NOPE.  None.  I was hoping and expecting more from them.

At same day, this salesman called me again saying the deal fell through apart because of the buyer's credit problem, so the car is available again.  I thought it's still a good deal.  So I drove down all the way to their place.  While I was almost there to their dealership, they called me again and told me that the car ""has been sold again"".",1.0

Cody Freeman was the sales person and I really have to say that he is an asset to the Universal Toyota team. Very respectful, helpful, truthful and honest young man. He really went far and beyond to earn our business and make this happen. It is clear that customer service and satisfaction is very important to Cody and the staff at Universal Toyota. It was a good experience for my wife and self. Also thanks to Bobby Garza in finance and every one else that made it possible for us to purchase this vehicle. We will definitely recommend Cody and Universal Toyota to friends and family. Our ratings for Cody Freeman and Universal Toyota are ""Excellent"" all the way. Please, keep up the good work.

143,"October 03, 2011","We found a vehicle on the website and stopped by to look at it.  We were greeted by Jerry Buitron who was friendly and helpful, he showed us the vehicle and let us test drive.  Once he knew we liked the vehicle the pressure was on and we were expected to sign papers that night.  After repeatedly telling him we still wanted to look at other vans he kept haggling the price on this specific vehicle to get us to sign that night.  We were completely uncomfortable and it took forever trying to get our personal vehicle keys back with 2 crying kids.

I gave him my info on me and my trade in. Over acouple days we talked got the deal done. H said bring our trade in and come get the new car. We live 200 miles away. Took time off work my wife and i. Found a sitter for our kids and dogs. Gased up cleaned our car and headed out. We talked to the salesman on the way for better directions. He helped said everything was fine and we would see him soon. We arrived sat down gave morr info and they took our keys. A couple hour after waiting . The salesman came back and told us that a sister dealerships manager wanted the car for himself and we couldnt have it. Iwas lied to the whole time. It was horrible and embarrasing for me and my wife. I was so angry for the time and money lost in this experience. I hope this never happens to anyone else.
