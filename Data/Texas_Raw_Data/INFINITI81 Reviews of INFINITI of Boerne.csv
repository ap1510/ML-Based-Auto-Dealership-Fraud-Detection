5,"November 04, 2018",The entire dealership works together to insure the buying experience is as little stressful as possible. From the moment you enter this dealership you feel that you are their center and they go out of their way to make you feel comfortable. At no time is there pressure to buy or to add something you did not need or want. Truly an unique buying experience ,5.0

7,"July 28, 2018","Upon entering Infiniti of Boerne a couple of weeks ago; I felt like an honoree at an event. My husband and I were greeted warmly and professionally by Tim Hejl, a salesman with whom we had a scheduled appointment prior to visiting the dealership.   Tim immediately commenced to make us very comfortable by offering coffee and other refreshments.  Without further to do he took us out to the vehicle that, in fact, we had admired upon entering the dealership, not knowing that the 2017 Qx30 infiniti vehicle would be ours within thirty minutes after we entered the dealership. Yes thirty minutes..The personnel at this dealership are so well connected that we were able to complete finance paperwork with J. Michael Crittenden, a true professional .within twenty five minutes. 

Afterwards we were introduced to other personnel aligned with the sale, to include the Manager. All of the individuals mentioned were friendly, professional, adding to a welcoming atmosphere.

We were then shown the service area, vehicle maintenance.  We were greeted by a super nice service manager, Jose Rodriquez, who pointed out the key functions of the vehicle that we had purchased, along with showing us the service maintenance area. Before we left this spotless facility, we were given a complete tour of the beautiful dealership, a spacious and fully equipped waiting room, to include the beautiful and impeccable state of the art bathroom facilities..

Lastly, visiting this dealership was a real pleasure, so relaxing, no stress or fuss, and most of all my husband and I appreciated that there was a place for everything and everything in its place. Not outside sales personnel waiting to pounce on the first customer to drive up, unlike a lot of other dealership that I have visited in the past, where salesmen are all in clusters in front of the dealership..

I highly recommend this dealership to anyone looking to find personnel who subscribe to excellent Public Relations...Infiniti of Boerne is a top notch dealership. The personnel are there to serve you by rolling out the Red Carpet during each juncture of your car buying experience . Your every request is tailored to meet your needs, and let me tell you, the personnel at Infiniti will meet and exceed your expectations for the duration of your vehicle ownership.  It is a pleasure to write this review!

16,"June 04, 2018","Best service we have ever received at a car dealership! From the moment we inquired about a used vehicle, James never made us feel like we were at a car dealership. He spoke with my husband, told us what we could expect for our trade in, and we were able to make a deal before we even drove over an hour to see the car in person! From the moment we arrived, we were given free range to check out the Yukon without anyone breathing over us...oh, and paperwork was already in progress so we didn‚Äôt have to wait as long as it can take. The waiting area is very nice and clean and includes complementary snacks and drinks while you wait (maybe 20mins) to sign paperwork. Easiest experience ever buying a car!! Very friendly unlike anything we‚Äôve ever experienced. Would definitely make the drive to see them again in the future. Thank you James! ",5.0

My salesman Tim Hejl was extremely helpful and his willingness to help me with all my questions even after the sale of my car was great. He was very professional, went above and beyond. He had everything set up and ready to go for me when I got to the dealership. He stayed late to accommodate my work hours that make sure I got my new car. He never rushed me and husband, took the time to go over all of the exciting features of my car with us. The finance manager was also extremely helpful, he worked with us on the numbers we were looking for. He was also very professional and stayed late to ensure our financial decisions with our car was just right. We will definitely go back to service and purchase more cars in the future. I will recommend this dealerships to all my friends and family. ",5.0

My husband and I live over an hour away. Mr. Armstrong and their business associates allowed us to do the entire communication over the phone. Came in, greeted with smiles and friendly attitudes. Test drove our new QX80 and were in an out within 2 hours. Would definitely recommend them. ",4.8
32,"March 24, 2018","Found this on the interwebs and decided to just pop in.  Rob Anderson, our soon to be sales guy, greeted us with the keys, so all we had to do was hop in (we we're on the lot a sum total of 2 minutes) and take her for a spin! 
That was it.  SOLD.  Well, we did go home that night and sleep on it first.  But the next day (today in fact) we were back at the lot with our trade and and a short time later, our NEW RIDE!
Thanks Rob, and everyone else for being so nice, and easy to work with.  It was a pleasure!",5.0
33,"February 23, 2018","The dealership is so beautiful it‚Äôs intimidating and I didn‚Äôt feel like I shouldn‚Äôt be there. But Rob was my saving grace he tried to eleviate my fears, The steps were easy and it was incredible experience. My experience has always been one obstacle that builds onto the next. Rob walked me off the ledge and Mike helped my wish  come to fruition. Thank you are words that seem so inefficient for my gratitude and the sense of respect.!",5.0
34,"February 14, 2018","I tend to be a very detail-oriented person.  In my profession, dealing with someone like me would drive me crazy.  I'm the customer who hears the slightest or faintest odd noise, makes a note of it, and waits until I have a list of several issues before bringing it in for evaluation.  Each time I bring my g37 to Infinite of Boerne, they treat me as if I'm the most important customer they have and as if each of my complaints is a valid and potentially fixable issue.  The past 2 visits I have had Jose as my customer service manager.  He was literally waiting to open my car door as I pulled up.  He takes every concern of mine extremely seriously and never makes me feel dumb about the minutia that worries me.  His past experience as a mechanic is also invaluable, as he knows the ins and outs of these vehicles.  The dealership is extremely generous.  They handwash your car without being asked, and I'm pretty sure they clean up the interior, but have never even mentioned it.  They gave me a loaner each visit requiring some repair, which also costs them money!  I kept the loaner, no questions asked, until every single issue was evaluated thorougly, fixed if needed, and I was completely satisfied.  They have come to my house to pick up and drop off my vehicle, and this last time, they even met me out in an area I was scheduled for a meeting (thanks to Christina!).  I couldn't be happier with the service, the prices, the people at the dealership, and the peace of mind I have.  I will miss this place when we move from San Antonio .  To Infinti of Boerne, thank you for everything!",5.0
35,"January 26, 2018",I loved every minute of being in this dealership. They made me feel like family! Every person came and congratulated me on my new car and was genuinely excited for me! I will tell everyone to go this dealership above any other! I never felt pressured on any decision I made. ,5.0
36,"January 25, 2018",From start to finish I had a great overall experience. Everyone I worked with was very nice and patient w me throughout the car buying process. I will definitely recommend this dealership to my friends and come back when I need my next vehicle ,5.0
37,"January 16, 2018","Rob was great from the beginning! I called about a pre owned vehicle and spoke to him, set an appointment for a saturday. When I came down to the store, I was greeted professionally and promptly by him. We talked about my plans for a vehicle as well as a trade in and rob and his team did everything in their power to put me into that vehicle I wanted. Unfortunately we were unable to get the deal done. As I left boerne, thinking my deal was not going to get don, Rob and his team stayed avid and ended up finding me an even better deal that I wanted! We were able to trade in my 2004 Nissan 350z with negative equity, and get into a brand new q50! Everything was explained in the finance department clearly and that helped me make the decision I made to purchase. Thanks jmc!

I can't thank rob and his team enough! I feel like every possible Avenue was approached and he was able to finally pull the right strings and help my family out! We will definitely be back when it's time for a new car. Thanks again!",5.0
38,"December 28, 2017","I purchased my first Infiniti at Infiniti of Boerne and I can not say enough about the dealership, the sales staff and the service I received when I purchased my new vehicle. When I arrived to pick up my new Infiniti QX50, they had the vehicle ready for me. Rolando spent more than an hour just answering all of my questions and explaining all the features. They were all so kind and I will always buy my vehicles from Infiniti of Boerne. In addition to the sales staff and service, the QX50 is an amazing vehicle. I have upgraded from a Ford Escape and I had no idea all the features that come standard on a QX50, and the way it drives is amazing. It is very sporty and fun to drive! It is a wonderful car!",5.0
39,"December 03, 2017","Car buying is usually such a hassle.  No matter where you go it always seems like you go in to look at a car you spend hours negotiating and being pushed hard to buy. 

Not at this dealership!!!

I found a car online, and contacted the dealer about it.   Did all the negotiations via email and text.  We set an appointment and the paperwork was ready when we got there.  

I truly pleasurable buying experience. ",5.0
40,"December 03, 2017","Jeremy made this the smoothest car buying experience! He was knowledgeable, helpful and went out of his way to help us through the entire process.  I highly recommend him to anyone looking for an honest, professional and knowledgeable salesman.  J. Michael in Finance was very helpful as well since this was my first experience purchasing a vehicle on my own.  I appreciated his honest advice and guidance!",5.0
41,"December 01, 2017",My total experience was excellent. Living inSan Antonio we started at another dealer where we walked out after a short time of dealing with their mess. Decided to make the drive to Beorne  and it was well worth it. The facilities were excellent and everyone I delt with were energized and truely helpful. I can honestly say I‚Äôve never met a dealership or salesman I liked but my experience here was entirely different. Rob Armstrong was our salesman and did an outstanding job of listening while still truly helping us through the process. I hope to have a long relationship with this dealership and Rob. ,5.0
42,"November 30, 2017","Had a great experience purchasing our QX80. We came in and test drove a couple and looked at others. A lot of time was spent with us to learn about features and differences between all the available options. We had one concern about the vehicle we intended to purchase and Rob got it fixed immediately. We were able to do a lot of the purchasing process at home and over the phone so everything was prepped and simple to leave the lot once we arrived. With a newborn at home, this was a major value-add which made for a great experience. ",5.0
43,"November 23, 2017","I've had my car serviced at Infiniti of Boerne 3 times since I purchased my G37 a year ago and each time both the service team and their assistant manager, Shawndy, have blown my expectations out of the water. They provided me with a complete sense of confidence and relief each time, receiving comprehensive inspections, quick and accurate diagnosis of any issues, and efficient repairs. Costs are slightly higher than what you might expect at a local garage, but the level of service, care, confidence, and peace of mind is well worth it and has me looking forward to any of my vehicle's future visits.

44,"November 19, 2017","I absolutely had the best experience ever!
From start to finish the service was suburb! 
Anisia was absolutely amazing in every way possible, she was so helpful and so understanding, it was a wow! Please ask for Anisia if you want to buy an Infiniti she is truly amazing! I Love my QX50!!!  ",5.0
45,"November 17, 2017","I was looking for a QX80 for my wife. I reached out to several dealerships with very specific needs and wants. Anisia was very informative, but most important to me was that she was really communicated with us. She really helped us feel like we are making the right decision even though we never met in person, we lived in Austin and she was in Boerne. She got is the most amazing deal we could‚Äôve hoped for. She was with us throughout the entire process and I cannot overstate how communicate she was. I will forever do business with them when I‚Äôm in the market for another infinity. This is how vehicle buying should be. Oh and she delivered the car personally to us. Thank you again!!

46,"November 16, 2017","I first learned about Infinity of Boerne from the Car Pro Show on WOAI in San Antonio. I was looking for a pre-owned QX80 for my wife and was introduced to The general manager and Anisia when I registered on the Car Pro Show‚Äôs website.
Anisia called me and introduced herself and said she would be helping me find the right car for my wife. Since my wife wanted all-wheel drive it took a little while to locate the right combination of color, mileage, accessory packages and all-wheel drive.
However, Anisia was very good about following up with me. When she was not at the dealership, she had Christian Metzger help me.
Both Anisia and Christian are very helpful, friendly and knowledgeable. Neither of them are pushy or hard sale types which I really appreciate.
When they finally got the right car at the dealership Anisi called me to tell me it was all-wheel drive and would I like to come take a look the next day. I did and we took it for a test drive and then Anisia set it up for me to take it home so my wife could try it. I was going to sell our current vehicle but asked for a quote just for comparison. Josh Mills gave us a very good trade-in value and it ended up being a much easier transaction doing a trade-in.
The quotes and final financial transaction was simple and stress free, as was the financing as they shopped several banks for me to get the best deal.
I finally brought my wife to the dealership on the day we signed the paperwork. She was greeted with a hug from Anisia and then a very pleasant and relaxed tour of the service department and amenities at the dealership.
Anisia took care of all the documents and then spent a long time going over all of the features of the vehicle and how to use them. She even had a big red bow on the car for my wife.
We never felt rushed, in fact Anisia made us feel like she had all afternoon just for us.
When we finally left I called my wife from my car to just get her thoughts. She said that she loved her new car and said she really liked Anisia.
I would definitely recommend Infinity of Boerne and working with Anisia and Christian.",5.0

After months of looking for a vehicle, I spent less than 2hrs of total communication including before and at the dealership ‚Äî and this included a trade!

63,"November 05, 2017",I had just graduated from A&M at the time and was working in Dallas. I dreaded the idea of not knowing what I wanted to buy or the process of going through a dealership and not knowing enough. I was between a pre owned escalade and was also considering going with something smaller for the city such as the Q50. Anisia was able to talk me through some of my options and ultimately point me in the right direction. Living in a city a smaller vehicle and going with a Lease option allowed me to keep my payments down and in warranty. The vehicle was delivered straight to me from Anisia and the entire process could not have been easier. Even after the deal she kept in touch with any questions I had which was a huge deal to me.

I was greeted by Anisia and was not only impressed with her knowledge of the vehicles but also by her friendlyness and sincerity. I leased a Qx 60 from her and not only did she deliver it to my home in Houston but gave me a much needed class on how everything worked. I have owned Mercedes, BMWs and Volvo‚Äôs but never had impeccable service like I did with Ms Laird. My lease is up in two years and I will either buy or lease my next vehicle from Ms Laird.",5.0
72,"November 03, 2017","By far one of the best service experiences! I purchased my car through Anisia Laird and not only did she make the process so easy and time efficient, she delivered my car to me. Anisia was genuine, personable, and made me feel comfortable. Their service team is exceptional in that they picked up my car for maintenance, while covering me with an Infiniti to drive in the meantime. Being a new mom and not a local resident of Boerne, this was HUGE! My car was returned not only serviced, but detailed and polished as if brand new again. Thank you Anisia and the entire team for valuing my time and giving me the red carpet treatment. I have since recommended several friends and family who have purchased from Mrs. Laird and received the same quality of care and service ",5.0
73,"November 03, 2017","I purchased my new Q60 on 7/23/2017 my sales rep Rob Armstrong made this one of the best buying experiences ever.  He made sure to get us as many discounts that were available and ensured our new car was exactly what we were looking for.  He took his time, there was no sense of pressure to buy and made us feel like we were not just buying a new Infiniti but we were joining the Infiniti family. This dealership is pristine, there is not one person I have dealt with that has not made me feel like I was their # 1 priority.  Just took it in for a service recall and Rob was there on hand to get me checked in and set me up in a loaner car.   Awesome experience all the way.",5.0
74,"November 03, 2017","With nearly 25 years of experience - Rob is the best car buying advocate.  His knowledge, friendly nature, honesty, patience and understanding of the entire process from trade-in to financing is so hard to come by in this industry!  You know you are getting taken care of when you see Rob and the best deal possible.  Thank you for all of your help!",5.0
75,"November 02, 2017","Hands down the BEST experience I‚Äôve ever had! I‚Äôve owned several luxury vehicles - Land Rover and Cadillac to name a few - and have never been treated as wonderful as I have at Infiniti of Boerne. Anisia is super friendly, attentive, and very knowledgeable! She is a true asset to the dealership. She made everything seamless and painless and was with us from start to finish! She took really great care of us! Victor, the sales director, was also very friendly and not pushy whatsoever! He was attentive to what we were wanting to accomplish and made such a great offer we couldn‚Äôt refuse. We were introduced to the service advisor Jose Rodriguez who greeted us with a huge smile and warm welcome and set up our first service appointment! We had a couple questions and he was also very knowledgeable. All around an awesome dealership! ",5.0
76,"November 01, 2017",Rob made my buying experience as easy as possible.  I let him know what I was looking for and what I was willing to pay.  He worked hard to meet my wants.  He is easy to talk with and respects your time.  He is very knowledgeable of all the products and gives constant personal service.,5.0
77,"November 01, 2017","I have purchased many new vehicles over the past 20 plus years and I would have to say the experience that I had with Boerne Infiniti and Anisia Laird was one of the best I have ever had. Anisia was very upfront and honest with us and followed up with us after the sale. I have sent multiple friends to her over the past year and they have thanked me for getting me in touch with her. The service center has gone out of their way to make us feel welcomed when we take the vehicle in for routine service. I recommend Anisia and Boerne Infiniti  for your next vehicle purchase.

78,"November 01, 2017","The dealership by far is one of the most friendliest and has the most knowledgeable and caring staff that I've ever encountered. I had used this dealership first in the beginning  for their service department because the ""other Infiniti Dealer""In San Antonio was horrible... Jose in Service here at Boerne along with Katie, instantly made me feel welcome and I found that getting a car serviced wasn't such an ordeal to get an oil change. I then decided I wanted to trade vehicles, where I met Anishia, who by far is the best salesperson, with so much knowledge and is so personable and the love of her job shines through. and exceeded my expectations in everything. For the first time ever it was a pleasure to buy a vehicle . She showed me things on my new QX80 that I never knew how to use on my previous one and followed up with me on everything a few weeks later. I would highly recommend this dealership to anyone ",5.0
79,"October 29, 2017",Rolando Rocha of Infinity of Boerne was very friendly helpful knowledgeable and professional in helping me select my Q50. I am very satisfied with the services I received from Rolando and will certainly recommend him to my family and friends.,5.0
80,"July 09, 2017","We bought a used chev from  Infiniti of Boerne . Mr. Rob armstrong was our sales person. He was very respectful, kind and went the extra mile to make me happy. We ended up having an issue with our car not to long after we bought it.  we call mr. Armstrong and He took care of us right away. He went above and beyond to fix the issue . Although a loaner wasn't supposed to be provided to us , he took that extra step to make sure we weren't left without a car. There is not one bad thing i can say about infiniti of boerne. I give them a five star rating and will only purchase vehicles from there dealership. ",5.0
