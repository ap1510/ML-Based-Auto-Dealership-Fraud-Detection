15,"October 19, 2017","This is the second Sonata I've purchased from this dealership. Both buying experiences have been hassle-free and completely satisfactory. Except for walking out with a free automobile, I don't think things could have gone better. My salesman, Joe Hernandez, was exceptional, and I also was impressed with other staff members I met or dealt with. This definitely is a dealership that wants a customer's business -- unlike the other dealership in a nearby city where I purchased my first Sonata. The folks at AutoNation are accommodating, professional, knowledgeable and fair. Couldn't ask for more.",5.0
16,"October 12, 2017","My second auto from this Dealership in a year and they did not disappoint.  I purchased a 2017 Hyundai Accent for my son and the Sales Manager (Steve) went over and above my expectations by getting me the best price for the car we wanted.  Better yet, I got additional rebates and cash off the car I wasn't even expecting, thanks to Steve.  Even though the dealership didn't have the color on the lot I wanted, they went to outside dealerships and FOUND the color I wanted at no additional expense to me and delivered the color I wanted the next day.  I never feel like I have ""overpaid"" for the vehicle(s) I have purchased from this Dealer, and I have never felt pressured into buying their car unlike other Dealerships in Tyler.  The staff here is trustworthy, honest and respectful and you will get the best deal in East Texas when you buy here.  I hope Steve is still around when I get ready to buy another vehicle - he is the only sales staff I will ever trust to purchase my autos from.  Thanks again - Job Well Done!",5.0

I have had my vehicle there several times in the last couple of months, and this happens everytime I call. I have a car currently in the shop, and can't get a hold of anyone to get the status on it. Very frustrating.",1.8

31,"August 31, 2017","I had my heart set on a Kia Soul.  However, I had decided to make sure it was the right purchase by shopping around.    When I went to Hyundai, Matt  was knowledgeable and personable.  He seemed to care that I get the right car for me whether it was from them or from a different dealership.  Steve  his manager was also helpful and knowledgeable.  They were not pushy.  I had the impression that they believed in the quality of their product.  I then went to Kia, unfortunately.  The staff was pushy and we caught them in an outright lie in the name of selling the car.  One of the salesman took a great deal of time bragging about his ""very expensive truck and how the purchase changed his life and it would mine.""  And that truck turned out to be a Chevy not the Kia he was selling me.   The salesman did not understand how financing worked.   They charged over $1400 for pin-stripping that did not do improve the look of the Soul.  And they employed every tactic in the stereotypical used car salesman handbook. Even stating, ""Come on back and lets put pen to paper for this deal of a lifetime"" after we got up in the middle of the conversation to leave.   We immediately went back to Hyundai to reserve our car.",5.0
32,"August 31, 2017","This was my first time going into the Auto Nation dealerships and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised. I was greeted immediately, asked what I was looking for, and was shown everything that I wanted to see. The salesman then gave me pricing details for the vehicles I was interested in. I took them home, had a discussion with my wife, and went back there a few hours later to make the purchase. I would definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a vehicle and will go back in the future.",5.0

34,"August 25, 2017","I live in Florida and did most of the transaction online which made my experience excellent and outstanding.  I developed a fantastic line of communication with Steve, the Sales Manager, and after all the details was done, I drove 15 hours to Tyler, Texas and he already had everything set up for me with Christina in sales, and with the young man in Finance who had a picture of him when he was in the military with Ronald and Nancy Regan (awesome picture).  I usually don't trust dealerships, but I do trust our men and women that served in our military and that continue to serve.  This goes to Steve as well...thank you both for your service.  I was in and out and received all the information.  Christina has been following up with me even after the deal was complete.  I was completely impressed and also left a facebook post on dealership page I believe. Thanks, Kathy Lee",5.0

We went to the dealership to look to have something to do. We was greeted by a excellent person Christina at the dealership.  She helped us and took her time and was well knowledgeable about her job and the vehicle and options that I was interested in. The whole staff made us feel like we was family. Everyone was so nice and generous and kept my kids occupied by taking them to a waiting area with a TV where I could do what I needed to do. Upon leaving I felt as if I had known Christina my whole life. I was worried about my kids and kept apologizing and she would just say it's ok I have kids of my own. When everything was done and over the staff helped us get things out of one vehicle into another which was really helpful. After returning home to Louisiana Christina called to check and see how things went with the new car on our trip home and to see how I was liking it. It's by far the best experience with buying a vehicle I have had. Everyone that had a part in my vehicle purchase process was all great and worked things out and done what they had to do.

My questions were answered and they showed respect by not pressuring me on the first visit with the ""what can I do today to get you into a new car"" approach that I found so distasteful at other dealerships.  The same respect was shown on my second visit.  I felt very confident when I returned on the third visit to purchase my vehicle that I would be a satisfied customer.",5.0
100,"November 22, 2016",I purchased a 2017 Elantra. I am very pleased with the car and the service I received. No one was pushy and everyone was very knowledgeable and friendly. I have already recommended this dealership to multiple people. It was a great buying experience!,5.0

102,"November 09, 2016",The very first time we visited there was one salesman showing cars to someone in the lot and no one inside the dealership. We left and came back later and that was when we met Steve F.  We have looked at lots of cars over the last few months and he was definitely the best salesman that we had talked with. He was probably the reason we ended up buying the Santa Fe sport. He made it a good  experience.  The only downside was that we found no one in the office when we first went there.  The second time we were greeted immediately.  I am doing the ratings on our second visit.,5.0
103,"November 05, 2016",The entire staff were professionally and very welcoming during the entire process. Jilberto was understanding & worked out a great deal for the SUV I wanted. I couldn't be any happier than the outcome I've recieved. Thank you guys!,5.0

106,"October 18, 2016","I went to several dealerships in the Tyler area and every last one of them acted too busy to sell a car. I admit that I attempted to buy a car at 6pm on a Saturday. But once I arrived at Hyundai AutoNation, Bruce Morris made me feel welcomed and important. He never once talked over me, he was informative, and he was non-judging. I enjoyed his jokes and personality. He was great!!! I believe he had only been working there 2 or 3 months when selling me a car, but I felt confident in him because he is so genuine. If he didn't know an answer then he would find the answer. He stayed diligent, but respectful. He didn't try to over-sell or be pushy, but also he wanted to get me in a car that I liked. I would buy another car from Hyundai AutoNation again....... but will follow Bruce Morris to whatever dealership he decides to work. What a great experience!!! I love my Hyundai so much. I was hoping to buy a Tiburon, but that model is no longer available. Bruce put me in a Genesis and I LOVE it! What a great car. I feel like a superstar now, after dealing with Bruce and buying a Genesis coup!!!! All I can say is wow. You guys are great engineers. Enjoy.",5.0

He is so very nice, friendly, informative, helpful and best of all no pressure.

A young man asked me where my car was, asked for the key and then took my car and disappeared. I was NEVER advised as to how long the process would take or whether I had enough time to wait.  After a 45 min wait I asked as to the status since I had an appointment.  When told it would be another 45 min or so, I asked for the car back so I could make meeting.  May I suggest you ""Tell the customer what you are going to do, tell them how long it may take, ask if they have the time available, and then advise them if it take longer that expected.""  ",4.4

The information requested for the loan when buying the new car was extensive and in my opinion to much.  They worked with us on a down payment that we could afford.  The salesman we worked with was professional at all times.  The dealership did bring us our car for delivery without the full tank of gas and we had to wait for him to go fill it up before leaving the lot with it.  He did offer for us to go with him and we said no.  The payments did end up bein gmore than we were told in the beginning, but we settled on a payment that was slightly higher than we ha anticipated.  They said this was due to the lean holders interest rate.  Overall I would say our experience was on the lower end of good, but not all bad either.
