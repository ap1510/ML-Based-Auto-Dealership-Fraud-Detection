4,"May 27, 2020","sold me a extra policy for the inside of my car said if anything damaged it just pay a small deductable and it would be fixed. not the case seems sabine needs an extra 400 to do the job, makes the policy not quite what was represented. ",1.0
5,"May 27, 2020","before I received the recall on my f-105 I had called a Chevrolet dealer to try and set up an appointment for my daughter's Malibu and they said that they would call me back with an appointment, I never received that call so I called a different Chevrolet dealer and they said that they would call me back with an appointment, two days later I called them back and was told the same thing again, and now four more days has past and no one from Chevrolet has ever called me back.
             when I called Sabine River Ford they instantly looked up my vehicle by the vin number and confirmed that there was a recall on it, I also informed them that I had other issues with the truck and that it was still under warranty and that I didn't purchase the vehicle from them. Sabine River Ford set up an appointment right then, while I was on the phone. when I took the vehicle at 8:00 am I picked up the vehicle that day at 2:00 pm although I know you can't always receive your vehicle back that fast most of the time the service was excellent. the next vehicle that I purchase I will start at Sabine River Ford just because of their service department.",4.0

17,"November 05, 2019","Bought a 2014 Mercedes from them a few days ago. 
Everything was going good till the deal was about done and I asked to have the car cleaned 
and gassed up ready for me to pick up. They  agreed to clean the car but no gas. The sales person
got an attitude about it and made a big deal.  Gas gauge was on E when I picked it up. Just seems like
a little thing to make there customers happy, better customer service would be nice .",3.0

24,"April 29, 2019","I highly DO NOT recommend this dealership. Not willing to negotiate, have horrible customer service skills (except for a trainee named Antonio, he was outstanding) and are interested in themselves and only their bottom-line profit. My wife and I were in the signing process and noticed (once the car was detailed) that their was a huge scrape along the left side of the Kia that we were buying. We asked for this to be fixed after we had already wrote a check and they declined and acted as if it was our responsibility to see this prior to purchase. After agreeing to pay the full-price that was being asked for the car they declined to fix it and said it's our issue and in return we immediately were told if we didn't want the car ""as-is"" to rip up the contract and we did. This dealership WILL NOT go the extra mile for you and will do only what is expected of them by their so-called procedures. It's apparent, they DO NOT CARE about your best interests and instead of paying offering to fix a scratch on the care instead lost a $15,000 purchase. Not only did they lose business from us on both the service and the sales part, we will make effort to remove our entire family and friends from EVER using this dealership again and will do so with great effort on our parts. Do yourself a favor and do not waste time as you will be very dissapointed. ",1.2
25,"April 29, 2019","I am always a little disappointed when I bring my car in for an oil change.  The last time they didn't air up my tires, didn't put on a sticker for me to know when the next oil change should be and didn't reset the change oil light.  This time they didn't air up the tires.  This was definitely an improvement from the last time but shouldn't they have a checklist of things to do? ",4.6
26,"April 18, 2019", Sabine River Ford was on top of the issues . For this visit it was an oil change and to find and repair a slow leak in my tire.  They were professional and  courteous .  The reason for the slow leak was a very small staple that managed to pop  through the tread .  ,5.0
27,"March 20, 2019","This dealership, and it's employees, ""Rock"" in every way!! For buying or servicing your New or Pre - owned vehicle this IS THE place to go!",5.0
28,"March 15, 2019",I had an appointment for 8AM to have my 2015 Explorer repaired.  I dropped the car off at 8AM. I needed a ride to work.  There wasn't anyone to give me a ride. I was told the person didn't get to work till 8:30.  Does everyone dropping off a car have to wait till 8:30 to get a ride? Whatever time you are open for business there should be someone there to help folks get to work.  My wife had to close her business to come get me. She had to lose 30 minutes of business time. Not good. ,3.4
29,"February 27, 2019","Great place to buy a car.  My salesperson, TJ Barlow, was very knowledgeable and helpful in my car buying experience.  I would highly recommend him if you are in the car buying mode.",5.0
30,"February 12, 2019","I have an F-250 Super Duty that I bought at Sabine River Ford. I needed  work on it for recall and an unusual celluloid problem that manages the Sync interface and was preventing truck from starting and causing lights to come on after truck was turned off. Work was done by the service department, Debbie Longmire was awesome.  Truck went in, diagnosed, she called me with cost of part replacement paid and done. 
 I then went next door to the Quick-Lane section of the dealership to schedule my oil change as I have all my service work done at the dealer I buy from, you know support those that support you.  I was scheduled for a 10:30 appointment. I also received an email confirmation of my 1030 appointment.   I arrived at 10:15, just in case they could get me in early... after going back and forth with the gentleman behind the counter I was informed that they could not get to me for, at a minimum an hour and a  half... I asked him why I would be given a 1030 appointment only to have to wait until 12 to get my truck in...he had no explanation  - Work in the service Department I can highly recommend - getting your oil changed at the Quick Lane portion - Take it somewhere else - My job requires me to schedule out my entire day.  that's why I schedule personal appointments in advance. If I had the luxury of sitting around waiting to be seen, I would go to a ""first come first serve"" oil change place and get a free car wash thrown in for good measure.  But I prefer to go to My Ford Dealership.  This was very disappointing.",3.0
31,"January 24, 2019","In Quik-Lane, my appointment times are always met with accuracy not leaving me waiting for excessive time.  I can ask for additional inspections of suspected problems and they are taken care of.  They will even allow me to look for myself since I have knowledge of vehicle operations.",5.0
32,"January 19, 2019","Had an appointment for an oil change and inspection at 7:30 AM.  Dropped off vehicle and asked that they also get it in for recall, if possible and give me a call when it was ready.  Waited all day an never heard anything.  At 5:30, called to see if vehicle was ready.  Said that it was ready, but they were unable to schedule the recall that day and I would have to get it back in to the service department for the recall.  I asked if it took 10 hours for the oil change and inspection.  I was informed that the vehicle had been ready since 8:30, but they had not had a chance to call and advise that it was ready to be picked up.  My wife went without a vehicle all day because they were too busy to call.......  I don't see how they could be THAT busy.....  I just viewed this as poor customer service.... Just my thoughts!",3.6
33,"October 12, 2018",This by far was the easiest purchase of a new vehicle that I have ever purchased. Willy Cox and the staff was so polite . We went there on a Saturday and within 2 hours we were leaving with our new truck. Willy explained in detail the paperwork and all our options and there was no high pressure on iur purchase. I would highly recommend Willy at Sabine River Ford. ,5.0
34,"February 27, 2018","I shared what i was looking for in a new (replacement) vehicle with Sabine River Ford. My research was done online. In less than a week i got a call saying they had what they thought I wanted in-house and could i come by and test drive it. I drove it. it was much more than I had hoped for, they even put it through their certified used car program to give me extra warranty. they offered to finance it and gave me several options. I bought a 2016 Ford Escape Titanium 4WD with everything I had asked for and more. From when I arrived to test drive the car and when I left them to prep it for delivery - it was only about two hours.  Unbelievably, they had the car prepped and ready for me by late afternoon! I highly recommend Sabine River Ford, its management, and Willy Cox my salesman.",5.0
35,"July 31, 2017",Negotiated the deal I wanted on the vehicle I wanted quickly and fairly.  One of the best buying experiences I've had purchasing an automobile.  My sales person presented me with all sales data needed and let me choose what was best for me!  Great job! ,5.0
36,"February 25, 2017","I initially made contact for an internet sale.   This turned into some kind of rant by this salesman named Mitch Canaday and an attempt to call me names indirectly with inferences of being crass, I could take a lesson from Hitler to a closing email written in the German language to further get his/her point across that I was some kind of Nazi customer from hell.  He/She never gave me the opportunity to negotiate a deal, rather expounding on how they see life as a dealer/salesman and what I asked for was not viable.  Perhaps sticking to the subject at hand and negotiating would have been what one would expect, but not the case here.  I guess if you just take whatever number they hand you, all is fine.  I should have known better than to expect someone out of state and not face to face play games.  I'd steer clear if you are considering this dealership for online purchases.  I can't speak of what the rest of the salesmen or saleswomen are like here.  This one however needs to take a vacation and get out of this business before they snap and cost the dealership a lawsuit.",1.7
37,"February 02, 2017","The best dealership in the area

39,"January 14, 2017","Bought 2 new vehicles from here 6 months ago, was very pleased! Went 1-13-16 and it's all new people, sat for well over an hour just to get my vehicle appraisal finally went to just go get my keys to leave and then hunter and the manager appeared! I Will Never deal with this dealership again! They have lost lifetime Ford owners.",1.6
40,"December 11, 2016","This is by far the very best experience I have had in purchasing a new vehicle! My salesman Paul was very helpful and accommodating through the whole process, they stayed several hours after closing to finish the deal and left all add ons strictly up to me, no hard pressure to buy anything I did not want! I would definitely go back for my next ford purchase! No back and forth between salesman and manager 
got me the deal I was looking for without any hassle! Just a great and pleasant experience for someone that dreads the new car dealing! ",5.0
