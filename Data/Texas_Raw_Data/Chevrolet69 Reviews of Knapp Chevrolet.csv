1,"December 31, 2019","My wife and I bought a Suburban, and Silverado in the same trip from Jared at Knapp Chevrolet. The experience was fast. We were not sitting in a dealership for six hours. I think we were there for a little less than two hours. I called ahead and they worked out a deal had the vehicles and paperwork ready to go for when we got there. Best truck buying experience we have ever had. Jared and Mike did a fantastic job. “We went to Jared”",5.0

16,"November 24, 2019","We went to several different  dealers. Every dealer tryed some ""trick"" to make a bunch of money. Ben was honest thru the whole process. Didnt try to fluff numbers. 10 of 10 would buy another car from him.",5.0

19,"November 14, 2019","Jared Pyland listened attentively and did all he could to satisfy my needs in a new vehicle.  He was friendly, easy to talk to and I never felt pressured in any way.  He was always willing to consider my requests and see if they could be fulfilled.  We were able to come to an agreement on a new Tahoe and Jared had the paperwork handled efficiently.

20,"November 11, 2019","Generally speaking, women are well-advised to be wary when car shopping. It seems that in many cases, car salesmen can be likened to ravenous sharks when a woman comes in a dealership to purchase a car. NOT THE CASE AT ALL at Knapp. I was in 4 dealerships that day, but there I felt at ease and was offered a VERY fair (according to edmunds.com )price for a very nice vehicle WITHOUT bartering or haggling. My salesman was Khalil, former Marine continuing his promise of honor and integrity to those he serves. Ray Escamilla was my Sales Manager. Good people!",5.0
21,"November 08, 2019","Fast and smooth transaction. Service department really helped me out with options on repairing my vehicle I eventually traded in, Jarrod in sales was a huge help providing options on leasing and buying until I found the right truck and Mike in finance was great helping with my approval. A+ customer service ",5.0
22,"November 08, 2019",Ben Webster was one of the most helpful salesperson that I have worked with. He was able to search their network of inventory and give us many options. We went ahead and chose the 2019 Traverse that they had at his location. Ben made the this process smooth and Financing was quick and painless too. ,5.0
23,"November 05, 2019",Very easy and friendly dealership. Ben did a great job with our trade-in and purchase. Would definitely recommend Knapp Chevrolet to friends and family. ,5.0
24,"October 29, 2019","Best place to get a new car. Had issues with my wife 2018 Traverse. Walked into Knapp and spoke to Jared and his team, they  got me in a new brand new Traverse with no issues. Very professional dealership.",5.0

27,"October 24, 2019","I was extremely impressed by the sales team and their attention to detail as well as their responsiveness. They worked with me to make the deal happen and the follow up after the purchase was equally impressive. Whereas others talk about how they want/appreciate your business, the people at Knapp actually showed me that they really did.",5.0
28,"October 17, 2019","Jared sets the standard for how a professional sales person should be. He was upfront, honest and genuinely cared about my concerns. I’m a very picky person, and most time I can be hard to please. But I told Jared what type of vehicle I wanted, including trim level and price point. And not only did he deliver, BUT he also added some extra perks. Throughout our transaction, not once did I feel pressured or hassled. He is an exemplary professional in his field, and it would be a pleasure to work with him again. He kept his promises, and went above and beyond to make sure I was a happy and satisfied customer. 


I also had the chance to work with Devon and Juan, they were both amazing. Devon spoke with my husband and I prior to us coming in. He assured us that he will work with us and make sure my wants and needs were met. He kept his promise. From start to finish he was made sure we were taken cared of. When we signed the paperwork, Juan did not push me to get the optional expenses. When I said “no” he understood and moved on. NO GUILT TRIP. They all  provided us with an overall excellent experience. Had us in and out in about an hour. I would definitely buy my next car at Knapp Chevrolet, and recommend others to do so as well. This is my 4th time buying a new vehicle, and as long as I’m in Texas, I will be a loyal Knapp Chevrolet customer!!!",5.0

31,"October 07, 2019",Went to Knapp Chevrolet nervous about purchasing my first NEW vehicle! Mike Romero and Jared Pyland were so patient and understanding. They took their time explaining the process to me and made my buying experience easier than I imagined it would be! i would definitely recommend these guys to anyone looking to purchase a vehicle without the hassle and pressure. My wife and I will be home coming back for a second vehicle with these amazing guys!!,5.0
32,"October 04, 2019",We came in to replace a flooded vehicle and were not enthusiastic about spending time or money to buy a new one. Jared was awesome in NOT trying to up-sell us and working with us to get us in and out of the dealership with what we were looking for and with as little headache as possible (and at a good price.) Definitely would recommend him and the dealership.,4.8
33,"October 03, 2019",I had to take my Silverado in for service. Chris Reyna helped me with a loaner vehicle and did a great job keeping me informed on the progress of my truck while it was in the shop. They took care of me right away and I would recommend the service department to anyone. Thanks again for the great service. ,5.0

Super quick and they weren’t pushy at all. I got the car of my dreams at a great price. Love this place! ",5.0
39,"September 23, 2019",So I told Jared exactly what I wanted and how much I was as willing to pay. He was able to meet my expectations easily. I tried many dealerships Jared was the only one who even came close. I will happily send everyone I know who wants a Chevy to him.,5.0
40,"July 24, 2019",Bought a suburban from Jared Pyland and he was very helpful until the deal was done. The car had been test drove the day before and the windshield got cracked he told me he was going to make the repair on the windshield  and never did. After the first week he would respond and tell me that he was working on details with his manager Luis Garcia  to get the windshield repaired and then stopped answering calls or texts. ,2.2
41,"July 19, 2019","Jared was a super cool guy to work with! I came in told him what i wanted, where i wanted my payments and they made it happen. Jared thank you for serving our country and helping me out on my new purchase!",5.0
42,"July 11, 2019","I purchased my car from Knapp Chevrolet and the sale went okay, but when I needed work on my car the service was horrible.  I thought since I purchase my car there, I should go there to get it repaired. The first time I took it in they told me that they could not find the problem.  So I had to bring it back because the same problem was getting worse.  I was told they didn't have enough time in the day to look at it, but they sign says that they close at 6 p.m. well I was there at 3:30 p.m.  So they asked me if I could leave it, I said yes because I was scared to drive it, but they didn't want to give me a loaner.  So at this point I'm asking why should I buy a new car from your company and there is a problem and you want give me a loaner.  So then they suggested that I take my car to another Chevrolet place and I did the next morning and guess what they found the problem with the car and fixed it.  I will never ever go to Knapp Chevrolet again.  I will post it on facebook to my friends letting them know to never take your business to Knapp Chevrolet. You will get a good salesman to sell you a car, but if something happens to that car then you are in trouble.  Why buy a brand new car and can't get it worked on, if something major happen to there car that you bought off their lot.  New cars should not have problems with them, but I know there is nothing perfect in this world, but you should be able to find and fix the problem.",1.0
43,"July 03, 2019","I found 2 trucks on Knapp’s website and asked if they were still available on there website got a call from Jared Pyland not even 2 minutes later, set it up to look at them that afternoon.

46,"June 19, 2019",Jared helped us tremendously when we thought it was impossible.  We were furthur away and did a lot of the details over the phone. When we arrived to the dealership our new vehicle was waiting for us and ready to go! We were able to get our dream vehicle without all the hassle of the typical dealerships. We greatly recommend Knapp Chevrolet and Jared! ,5.0
47,"June 19, 2019","Jared Pyland was extremely helpful as we looked for a truck through our online buying service. He helped us locate the truck that met our needs at a fair price.
He had the truck ready to go when we arrived and the whole process took less than 45 minutes.

51,"May 31, 2019","Just bought our first brand new family car and Jared Pyland was such a great help. Clear cut, direct, upfront service and Jared was always quick to respond to our texts and questions. This was probably the easiest car buying experience I’ve ever had. Thanks Knapp Chevrolet.",5.0
52,"May 31, 2019","Knapp Chevrolet has so far been very fast and proactive to assist me with my purchase of a new car. I called just before a holiday weekend, and explained that I wanted to purchase a Chevy Volt before the factory incentives ended a few days later. Jared Pyland assisted me, and made the process move very quickly and painlessly, despite the fact that I was calling from 920 miles away and had to conduct all of the business from out of state. The car was a good price, by virtue of the nearly $8000 in dealer and factory incentives.
Jared, Juan and Sonya acted quickly and started the process. The day after my initial call the financing was approved and all the paperwork was on its way via FedEx to receive my signature. Jared also took care of arranging transport of the vehicle to my home in Colorado. I look forward to seeing it when it arrives next week.
In contrast, I had contacted a different dealership in Pennsylvania first. This other dealership had 18 New Chevy Volts in stock, so I assumed they would be motivated to sell one of them. I couldn't have been more wrong. I wasted nearly an entire week with this other dealership, trying to get the process started to purchase a new car. Five days and many phone calls and text messages later, nothing had happened. They failed to even start the process and the salesmen wouldn't return my calls. I nearly lost the opportunity to get the factory incentives which expired at the end of the month.
Fortunately Knapp Chevrolet saved the day, and were able to accomplish within hours what the other dealership couldn't do in an entire week. Thank you for acting quickly to close the deal on my new Chevy Volt before the incentives expired!",5.0
53,"May 28, 2019",Jared was up front and straight forward.  No high stress pressure tactics like other dealerships.  Nice selection of vehicles and excellent to wok with.  You might look elsewhere but buy from here. ,5.0

""Knapp Chevrolet is a great dealership and helpful. 
My salesman was Jared Pyland and he was a very good salesperson to deal with as well as Gregory Watson was very helpful also. Jared worked hard to find me the best vehicle for the price I wonted to pay for our compeny van. As a non-profit we have to look at every penny we spend. ",4.8
55,"May 25, 2019",This is my third vehicle to purchase from Knapp and every time they are a joy to work with. Robby and Jared walked me through the entire process. They answered all my questions. I highly recommend that you go in and talk to them about your next purchase or lease. I am extremely happy with the level of care and attention to detail. I’m a Knapp customer for life!,5.0
56,"May 16, 2019","Our salesman was Jared Pyland and he was awesome to deal with. Gregory Watson has been our go to guy for many years and it was good to see him again. He and Jared worked hard to find the perfect vehicle for our daughter. Juan Martinez, in finance, was a blessing. He did everything in his power to find her the best terms and rate. These are the people who keep us going back to Knapp for all our vehicle needs.",5.0

58,"May 13, 2019",I worked with Jared on finding a good fit for me. He made sure we took our time finding the right car instead of pushing me into a sale.

59,"March 24, 2018","We bought a 2017 car from Knapp Chevrolet, paid cash and have called them repeatedly about not received our license plates and Title..  it has been almost 3 months.  I spoke with manager Luell who was very rude.  We are owed a refund of overpayment on our cashiers check and was told by finance manager that we would receive it the next week and still do not have it.  We are sending complaint to General Motors, attorney generals office and BBB.  We feel this is deceptive trade practice.  I would never recommend this company to anyone.",1.5

61,"March 25, 2017","Had my truck towed in on Saturday that I had just purchased from Knapp three weeks prior. It is a used Truck and I am not upset at knapp for the mechanical failure. However the following FRIDAY I was informed that they still haven't even looked at the Truck. All week I found it hard to reach my service guy Rick Braquet who rarely answers his calls, text, or emails. And when Rick would answer he'd lie and say they'd get to it this afternoon or tomorrow first thing. Theses tales started Monday evening. Yes by Friday I'm pretty frustrated. Would have definitely preferred an honest conversation. Definitely wouldn't recommend Knapp service center to anyone.",1.0
62,"February 15, 2017","On Knapp's website and AutoTrader, I found my perfect car. I was very excited to take this step, as it would be my first experience purchasing a car for myself. The car was located in Houston, Texas at Knapp Chevrolet, and I would be going through my credit union in Slidell, Louisiana, where I was for the time, to obtain a car loan. It was agreed that I would file paperwork, then drive to Houston to review and pick up the vehicle.

On Friday, February 10th, I called the contact number for the dealership to inquire about a used 2015 Nissan Versa Note, which I discovered was still in the dealership inventory. The salesperson physically confirmed the car was still on the lot. I immediately contacted my bank and began the process of obtaining an auto loan. I was in constant contact with the first sales representative I spoke to. He constantly made reference to ""getting the paperwork in order on our end.""

On Saturday, February 11th, my bank was closed and therefore could not finalize the loan application. I emailed necessary documents - drivers license and insurance information - to the sales representative, who emailed me back to obtain my cosigner's license (and therefore confirmed receipt of my documents).

On Monday, February 13th, my cosigner emailed his license image to the salesperson. I spent my lunch break obtaining membership and taking out an auto insurance policy on the vehicle (1 hour) and made arrangements with my bank to finalize loan paperwork. I left work early to do this. I arrived at the bank around 2:45pm, and while there contacted the sales representative to obtain a purchase order on the vehicle to finalize the loan with tags/title/license fees from the dealership. The bank and I waited for this document for around 2 hours, at which point my cosigner arrived. Loan terms and paperwork finalized, the bank cut us a check for the full amount of the purchase order. I left the bank around 5:30pm, 30 minutes after they closed.

On Tuesday, February 14th, (Valentines Day), I woke up at 4am to pick up my friend in New Orleans who would be riding with me to and from Houston so that she could drive my current vehicle back to Louisiana. My current vehicle - a 2002 Honda CR-V with 202,000 miles - wasn't something I felt I could get a decent trade-in value for. We drove through Baton Rouge, Lafayette, Lake Charles, and crossed the border into Texas around 8:50am. Shortly before the dealership opened (9am), I receive a text message from the salesman's personal cellphone informing me that the car ""was sold last night."" A text message.

Take what you will from this account. But know that it reflects a deep lack of professionalism. A deep lack of respect, a deep lack of concern for time, disrespect for deals done, signed, dated. A lack of willingness on the part of ""sales managers"" - involved at least at the point of obtaining the purchase order on 2/13 - to check necessary paperwork before selling the car to someone else. Note also that this would have happened in the 1 1/2 hours between sending me a purchase order for the vehicle and close of the business day (7pm). 

I drove through thick traffic the rest of the day. Upon arriving back to Louisiana, I then had to return to the bank to cancel the loan, have the check destroyed, and contacted my auto insurance to cancel the new policy. A check for the amount of the policy should arrive in 7-10 business days.

My calls have not been returned by the dealership or the salesperson. Do not do business with people who would put someone through this. Go somewhere, anywhere else, to buy a car.",1.3
63,"November 02, 2016",I purchased a vehicle at that location next thing you know I got an accident 3 months later the car was brand new I send the car back to get it repaired at the dealership where I bought it it's already November and have been at the beginning of August we are going into November and still have not have my car back I am really upset and disappointed because when they did give me the car back it was supposed to be ready but it wasn't electrical started coming on and it stopped in the middle of the freeway when me and my daughter were in the vehicle never Chevrolet headed to pick it up it's real simple and easy they should not have returned vehicle if the vehicle wasn't completed and I am very disappointed in the service that guy that I'm dealing with in the body shop is named Vincent he's very irresponsible person lack of communication with clients very poor judgement and what he says he has no idea of what happens to your vehicle when you're asking about your vehicle he is clueless on everything I would not advise anybody to deal with him,1.6
64,"October 18, 2016","I purchased my 2013 Grand Sport Corvette from Knapp Chevrolet brand new. The sales experience was great. I them started using the service department for maintenance and repair. They did an ok job overall until my last visit. I had brought the car for my oil change, my battery replacement and to fix my front tire that is leaking air. The rep told me that they would fix the tire for free and I didn't need to worry about it. When I came to pickup my car. I paid 700$ and the tire charges were there (a minor 20$ so I didn't sweat it). I drove the car out and the tire pressure sensor lit up. I drove the car back and they topped air in my tire saying they forgot to top air!!!!!. The following morning I found my tire flat, had to carpool to work for two days and contacted the customer service to report the issue. They asked me to bring it over the weekend and they would fix the tire. I brought it on Saturday, they did fix it that time and they asked me to pay another 20$. I said this was supposed to be fixed before, they said there was another nail so it is 20$ per nail. I wasn't going to argue about the 20$, but it is the poor customer service that I am complaining about. I told them they lost my business forever and sent few emails bit they don't care. Stay away from their service department.",1.4
65,"January 11, 2016","I work downtown, and only allow Knapp to service my 2015 Impala.  The service staff is friendly, and the shuttle ""courtesy car"" can quickly get me to work and back.   No complaints.  Even during the crazy Christmas season rush, they got me in-and-out in a jiffy.",5.0
66,"June 12, 2012",I see good reviews for this dealership so people have had better experiences.  I took my car in for an oil change and had an appointment to do so.  When I got there I was told that there were a bunch of people in front of me (why have an appointment).  I waited for 2 hours for the oil change and I had to go twice to ask about it.  They never came to update me.  The man I was working with did come to inform me that my car had a recall and i did make an appointment to bring it in for that but I will be going to another dealership.  I was patient but do not have any interest in waiting that long for something that takes 30 minutes.  They also needed to be a little more on top of it just to touch base with me because it took so long.  They said it was taking longer because it was hot but I am sure if I went somewhere else it would have taken half that time.  On top of that when I got home I noticed it looked like someone rubbed up against it when trying to get in my car and knicked some paint off (new car).  Will not be recommending or going back.,2.8
67,"March 09, 2012","This review is for both Knapp Chevrolet and Don Hewlett (Georgetown). I will post on Don Hewlett as well. Purchased a 2009 HD2500 Z71 4x4 LTZ approximately 6 weeks ago--End of January 2012--from Don Hewlett. 
On March 8, 2012 was driving down a neighborhood street and crossed a road hump doing approximately 10 mph. A loud pop occurred on drivers front side and truck was lowered down-appeared to be a flat tire. After taking a look found no flat tire, but could not see under truck due to being to low to ground. Called wrecker and towed me to Knapp Chevrolet (Houston), where I was told the following--""It appears that who ever performed the last alignment didn't tighten the nuts on the cam bushings"" ""Will"" then asked where did I put the new tires on--I commented that I had not touched the truck and that those tires were on on the truck when purchased. Well of course the parts were not covered under the 12 month/12,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty. After a few more minutes trying to convince Will i didn't put those tires on the truck-he said I would have to pay for a new alignment--$119.00. I called my salesman at Don Hewlett--Sam Evans and repeated the story. He said he would take care of it the next day that it should be under the bumper to bumper warranty and they would call Knapp. Friday morning i got a call from Will-Knapp of course stating that the torsion bar was damaged and needed replaced--$286.00-kind of saw that coming-never as simple as they say. Informed Sam with Don Hewlett and then received a call back informing me that Don Hewlett won't cover the parts/labor because not even the standard warranty covers the front suspension. After much discussion back and forth about what does ""Certified Chevrolet"" mean they still won't cover the problem. Sam commented that they checked the alignment and took tires off, but didn't check all the nuts and bolts. Sam stated that if the truck was at there location they could cover or at the very least just have me pay for parts alone. Sam commented that he (Don Hewlett) and his service manager can't be certain that Will at Knapp is telling the whole truth about the problem. If I would of broke down by there dealership it would have been taken care of. Had i taken this truck off road or through the mud I might could understand me having to pay, but I had put only highway miles on this truck. The reason ""Will"" with Knapp Chevrolet is getting a bad review is that there is no communication between the dealerships and that Will didn't believe that Don Hewlett had put the tires on the truck. He insinuated that I was not truthful in the tire/alignment issue. 
I see that Service after the sale is non-existent mostly within two months after the sale of truck. Certified - Well, Obviously means ""limited and and what breaks will ""most"" likely not covered under the warranty"".
