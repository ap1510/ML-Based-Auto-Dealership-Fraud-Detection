1,"May 15, 2020","My Murano caught fire with my my wife onboard and burned to the ground. This was eight days ago and the dealer who I have bought two vehicles from keeps saying they can’t help and Nissan America has given me a case number and will not even respond to us. It’s been eight days.
I expect at least some response.",1.0
2,"May 06, 2020","I usually don't leave reviews, but I wish I could give this review more than 5 Stars. Sales Manager, Mr. Calvin Williams most definitely exceeded my expectations! I dreaded going to car dealerships. Prior to Tom Peacock Nissan, I’d visited many car dealerships where I felt uncomfortable and pressured, but my interaction with Mr. Williams was the total opposite (thank GOD)! Moments after meeting him, it felt like I was talking to an old friend. He was very welcoming, knowledgeable, and honest about the line of vehicle I was looking to purchase. Mr. Calvin Williams was very patient with me and my credit situation. He also ensured that I was completely satisfied with my vehicle purchase before signing any paperwork. He was committed to helping me make the right choice for my personal interest and financially. When it was time for me to sign my documents, Mr. Williams sent me to a very nice and easy-going Rep (I can’t remember his name…. sorry guys). Which I felt was very important since this is the final and very important step in purchasing a vehicle.  This guy really knew his stuff and could answer all my questions without hesitation (I really wish I could remember his name). In all, my experience at Tom Peacock was a true blessing. Mr. Williams and the other guy sincerely showed me that I was a valued customer. Look no farther! Tom Peacock is the go-to spot for your next vehicle! ",5.0

Just make sure you understand your deal completely, have it in writing, and if anything doesnt doesn on the contract you sign and the deal you were promised, do not sign it until you have in writing, the specific details hashed out and signed by the manager. After everything, they did make good their deal with us, and things are moving along. ",4.0

7,"March 13, 2020","I was in the market for a ""gently used"" Ford F-250 Super Duty Diesel 4x4 truck - and was searching Car Gurus and other online sales sites. I got the lost leader BS from a few, another even told me I was approved for financing and to come get the truck - which was no longer there when I arrived after filing out the online application. My time is valuable - to me anyway so I took a stab at what looked like way to good to be true. Tom Peacock Nissan had a 2019 F250 FX4 6.6L turbo diesel with only 30K miles on it for under $50K - they actually sold it to me for $43K. I couldn't find any other vehicle within a 100 miles even close to that for a comparable unit so I inquired.

My Sales Rep Jon Wasserman called me and with no pressure simply asked if I was interested in the vehicle he would gladly hold it for me. In the meantime I submitted the application he sent and within about 10 minutes he called to say I was approved and he would be available whenever I was ready via his personal cell phone. I drove down a few hours later , did the test drive and couldn't believe the truck was really the one they agreed to sell. Jon suggested pulling the CarFax and reviewing it together which showed no negative history outside of routine service - and is still under warranty. Mr Wasserman is quite young but beyond his years in professionalism, understanding, and customer service - when you operate like that you really don't have to be closer. I have already told a few of my friends about Jon and Peacock Nissan and would definitely buy another vehicle from them. ",5.0

22,"January 03, 2020","The Good:
The Peacock Nissan dealership is very nice on the inside.  The salesman than we initially worked with, Joel, was fantastic on our first visit.  We had an initial test drive that went swell, and was enough to convince us that a nice Rogue was a good fit for our needs.

The Bad:  
The problems came on our second visit.  We identified a certified preowned vehicle that fit our needs and was advertised at a reasonable price for its condition.  However, this is the time where potential buyers should be the most wary of the dealership.  When we sat down to negotiate with Mehdi aka Mike, we were ready for a lot of the type of car dealer tactics you read about, and they did not let us down - the 'let me check with my manager' spiel, leaving us to wait for long stretches....the ""this is the lowest i can go, or else i'd be fired!"" - only to then lower the price further, and so on.  Pretty much the stuff you'd see in any article about car buying and what to look out for.   The game is the game, so while we were annoyed by all this, it was not surprising.  Mike was pleasant to work with, and clearly had awards to show that he was at least decent at his job.

What WAS surprising however, was the price sheet with not just the so-called 'buy now' price, but: 
-a ""Market adjustment"" (that was explained as 3 different things by 3 different people)
    + additional ~$1800
-a 'certification fee' (which to be fair, we did encounter at another Nissan dealership, but was not explained as ""REQUIRED"" the way it was conveyed to us at Tom Peacock
     + additional ~$1200
-dealer add-on charges (that we were told we did NOT have the option to decline as they were ""already installed"") such as nitrogen tires, door guards, and GPS??
      + additional ~$1000 or so in total

PLUS the tax/title/license, for a grand total of almost an additional $5000 over the advertised price of the vehicle.   (This is the part in any advertisements where the fine print saying 'price does not include any dealer fees' comes in to play and what you should be VERY careful of.   We noticed that some other official Nissan dealerships were not nearly as bad about hidden fees, so maybe start with those first)

After much back and forth with Medhi, we agreed on a price that he even had the audacity to draw a line on paper and have me sign to signify that ""we have an agreement"".

At this point, we begin to fill out the finance paperwork, and are ready to go on to the finance manager and finish the purchase process.

BUT - plot twist!
Israel Aguilar, the pre-owned sales manager, comes in to the office to sit down and tell us that ""they made a mistake"" in the pricing that we had just spent 45 minutes working to get to an agreed-upon point on.  He then proceeds to go into a whole spiel about how he needs us to ""do him a favor"" and go up by $1000 on the price that we just settled on.  He goes on a bunch of platitudes about how it's only going to add a few bucks to my monthly payment, and we won't even notice it and he didn't want to lose his job either, and blah, blah.... it is interesting that he wanted us to believe that the $1000 was going to hurt the dealership more to honor their ""mistake"" than it would hurt an individual family's budget.

By this time, we had been in the office around an hour and a half with these gentlemen wasting our and their time, but as we were not willing to accept their bait and switch, we decided it best to leave before they came up with some new and imaginative way to try to deceive us.

And don't get me wrong - i understand that they're a business and have to make some money, but considering the reputation that car buying and car dealerships in general have for being slimy, bait & switch scam artists, you would think that in this age of SO many options for buying vehicles, a good dealership would try to differentiate themselves with honest, quality service...but here we are.

To add insult to injury, we had no fewer than 4 followup calls in the subsequent days:
-a call the next morning from a lady trying ""to understand what happened"":  she tried to convince me that the 'mistake' they made was them forgetting to mention the certification fee (which was a lie, since it was one of the things we negotiated over initially, so it *definitely* wasn't forgotten)

-calls/texts inquiring about 'what [they] could do to earn our business'  - the easy answer there would have been to either sell us the vehicle at the price we mutually agreed on, or train salespeople not to try to get customers to sign off on a bottom line price if they plan on asking for more later on!

-a call from the very first salesperson (Joel) asking if there were any other Rogues we might be interested in.   This call was part of the reason i had such a favorable opinion of Joel - at no point during the entire time we were in the dealership did either Mike or Isreal offer or suggest any similar cars that were available - instead, they fumbled the sale by trying to get us to go up after having already bait and switched the pricing up to that point.


Needless to say, we purchased the vehicle elsewhere.
The bottom line is, you can *possibly* get a good deal here, just be prepared to deal with a lot of BS and even then, they may try to pull shady tactics right before the finish line.    We anticipate having to replace our other family vehicle later this year, and this place will definitely be at the bottom of the list.

26,"December 11, 2019",Lauren was wonderful to work with.   She has talent that makes her an excellent salesperson.   She listens to your needs and works hard to match the right vehicle to your needs.   I was not sure what I wanted - but I knew I needed to get out from under the vehicle I had.   My finance person was Nicolas (I think that is how you spell his name)  he was very good at what he does as well and he was passionate and was truly concerned that I would be taken care of.    I never thought I would say I look forward to having my truck serviced by the dealer - but the service I received when I purchased the vehicle will bring me back even though I pass at least 1 other Nissan Dealer on my way to Tom Peacock Nissan!!!!!     ,5.0

31,"December 06, 2019","VERY VERY BAD experience 
They advertised a 2019 Altima S for $18300
Went to check and even provided the VIN and the stock number for the precise car advertised, the whole thing was a wired on that day. Started with the salesman bringing the car and asking me to ride with him, took me to a side road where told me to drive it, went back afterwards to the main office where upon entering he asked me for my driver license and when I asked him why he said its for security reasons !!! I reminded him that I DO NOT my credit checked as I was closing on my house the next day and only need the drive out price today, he then said that its the policy to keep then customer ID with the salesman all time !!! He then brought another person (from my ethic background) who again said that they must have my ID again !! I finally gave them my ID hoping that they will give me the price so I can decide if to put a deposit and come complete the paperwork the next day  
The new sales man told me that the price will include tax title and dealer fees added and if there is extra options the price will be added ( which was expected)
I was surprised that he told me that the final price will be above my range and if I want to look for a cheaper car like a Sentra !! because the final price before adding title tax and fees is $31500 as they added a premium package to the Altima S , which was not mentioned in the add
I told them that this was false advertising and requested my ID back and left

32,"December 03, 2019","Found a used truck I liked online, called ahead and said I wanted the truck and asked them to have it ready, told them I had my own financing.. They said to come on in to buy the truck. When I get there they say in order to get the price I wanted online I would have to finance it through them. I walked out, then decided to at least temporarily finance from them. They then said the price was $2500 higher than the online price even though I lead now agreeing to finance from them and they wouldn’t honor the price that 

1-was online and confirmed over the phone previously 

2-online special price that they originally offered me if I financed through them

33,"December 02, 2019","We just purchased a new vehicle. Our salesperson, Orlando Dean was awesome! From start to finish he explained every step of our process.  We absolutely love our new vehicle.

From the beginning we explained that we wanted to keep the step rails from our old vehicle. This was our third Frontier truck and our other dealer, Baytown Nissan removed the step rails from our first vehicle and placed them on our second Frontier free of charge.

Unfortunately, the service department at this location seems to be more concerned with making money than Customer Service. When Orlando asked if they could remove the step rails they quoted me a price of 185.00 for removal from old truck and to install them on the new truck.

I asked to just have them removed and I would install on new truck myself. No, problem except I was quoted a price of 80.00 for removal. I am mechanically inclined and know that it would take a matter of 15 minutes or less to remove the step rails. I declined the  service. I will purchase step rails on my own and install them on my one.

My contract offers free service and two oil changes. I can honestly say that the service department at Tom Peacock will not be servicing my Nissan Frontier. The oil changes are free but sometimes we have to understand it is not always about the money.",3.7
34,"November 29, 2019","I hope this review is not removed because it's negative.!!!
I've leased a Sentra 2 years ago and the service was awesome. As a matter of fact, in the past I left 2 really good reviews in Google, but the last two times we went to get service, it was really disappointing and downright bad service.
Once my lease is over, I'm definitely NOT going back to Nissan. 
Last time I went to get an oil change and a car wash, some stole a bunch of quarters I had in the cup holder. Seriously? A couple of bucks and you are going to stain the reputation? 
I called and spoke with two people.
The first one was in the maintenance department and he was concerned about giving them a good service review. Nothing in the remote form of an apology or even the slightest hint that my complaint would be looked into.
The second was to the sales rep who sold me the lease. He apologized and said the situation would be brought up to management and looked into.
Never heard back from anyone.
And then last week,  we went for the scheduled maintenance service again. 
We called to make an appointment and were told there were no appointments, just walk-ins. When my husband showed up, he was told that on Mondays, an appointment was necessary! So he made an appointment for 3 hours later. Finally, they took the car and he was told one hour. They texted him a couple of times with ""issues""that needed to be taken care of. My husband  is a mechanic by trade, for over 30 years, and knows when and what needs servicing. He went along and approved the services, since it's a lease, and we don't want Nissan to later acuse us of not properly caring for the car.
Finally, 3 hours later, and a $300 bill to pay, he was told what was done to the car, etc.
To make a long story short, he inspected underneath the vehicle and what he paid for as a service that had been provided, had, in fact, NOT been done. Changing the brake fluid.
He brought it to the attention of the people at the service desk and the technician, who stood there, arguing with him about it, stating (and thereby admitting) that it'd take another hour to complete.
Because he needed to pick up our daughter,  he paid the bill and left, but we vow NEVER again to patronize Nissan. 
And last but not least, they were telling us the brake pads were gone and they needed replacing asap, as well as tire rotation, when we just had that done at a different location less than 30 days earlier. 
Customer service, very dissatisfied. ",1.0

BEWARE OF TOM PEACOCK NISSAN!!!!!!!

My daughter and I came to Tom Peacock to purchase a new vehicle. We ended up buying a pre own certified vehicle. 2 Months ago car was giving us transmission problems went back thinking the car was under warranty (7yrs 100,000miles) they told us the car was not a certified vehicle (FRAUD). That’s the only reason we purchased the car after talking to almost everyone there at Nissan dealer I was out of luck. After 3 days of flipping my house over I found the paperwork that showed the car was sold as a pre own certified vehicle.  They never sent the paperwork to Corporate to make the car (certified).  They do this to get out of paying the $2000 certificate with Nissan Corporate. Now 2 months in and still no car get a email or call every week that it has been approved but still no repairs.

40,"November 10, 2019","First, I had to get a hold of the service manager just to schedule an appointment because my call went all over the place 3 times-on hold for over 10 min, then asked for service manager.  Service manager politely scheduled my appt for routine service (oil change and rotate and balance-car inspection etc)...at that time, I told him that since I bought the car, which was this year mid-Feb, it had 16K miles, and is a 2016 Nissan Rogue SL, it was pre-certified, and I also purchased extended warranty, anyway, told him since I purchased the vehicle there has been a popping noise in front end, near tires. He scheduled my appt for Tuesday. When I got there Tuesday, Pablo assisted me, and got the maintenance performed, but said I had to reschedule for the noise (thought I already made this appt? Either way he was nice and informative, and I needed a couple other service, one I approved, and one I denied due to finances. So, Pablo made me an appt for the next day with Jennifer. On Wednesday, I was able to drop my car off and given a loaner (thank you).  All the while, my car now has 26K miles, so I'm assuming for sure something under warranty or I wouldn't even be in a loaner, right? WRONG! Didn't hear a word from Jennifer on Wed at all about my car, so I called over and over, until someone finally answered Thursday and I was told it hadn't been looked at.  At this point, I'm still thinking oh well at least I have a vehicle in the meantime. On Friday, I call and call and call (not sure what the heck is up with the phone system there, I kept getting, ""the person at extension 9999, is unavailable."" Totally annoyed, I finally receive a call around 11am from Jennifer who states I need front struts to the tune of $1400, and it wasn't covered under factory or extended warranty, I was very surprised that ANY car at $26K miles would need a repair that big so I asked her if they could make an exception, she said she would check with her manager.  I waited for over 3 hours until I drove to Nissan because I had to get my child from school and to dance, and again hadn't heard a word from anyone at this point, and I'm thinking well I may as well pick up my car and return the loaner, so I get there around 2 or so and Jennifer tells me the managers have all been in meetings.  I told her that I wasn't, and couldn't afford the repair right now, so I would just return the loaner, and pick mine up to avoid being charged for the loaner.  She told me I would be ok in the car until Saturday and that she got off at 5 and would call before then.  Again, I told her I had to pick up my child at school at 3:30 in The Woodlands and go straight to dance in Conroe from 4:30-5:30, so it would be hard to get back.  She says ok.  So, I leave, and get a call from her at 5:00 and she said that the manager denied helping with the cost and that my car wasn't under warranty???  Also, that I needed to have the car back by 7pm, and that it would be $178 for diagnostics.  I couldn't believe any of what I heard.  As a consumer, I'm appalled for several reasons.  1) I was NEVER, not ONE TIME, told that there was any diagnostic fee, nor was I ever told it was this amount. 2) I had to haul some serious butt to make it from Conroe back to Spring in 5:30 traffic when I was already there once that day (not to mention the gas I had to put back in it, again). 3) 2 different sales people approached me to try and put me in a 2019, when I was just still in shock that a car that was pre-certified was causing me issues after only owning for 8 months (why would I want another Nissan at this rate)? 4) I could NEVER get through to service to speak with the manager prior to getting there....so to top this off, I slide in at 6:30. No service manager there to speak to, my advisor was gone; however, Pablo who helped me on Tuesday was there and I would like to praise him for being such a great person btw!  He listened to me vent and asked me if I was told about the possibility of diagnosis, I told him heck no!!!  At this point he had to listen to a very upset customer, but he did so with so much poise (even though he couldn't help me with the cost).  So, as we turn to the cashier(s) (who were amazing as well), no one has my paperwork and had no idea I was bringing in the loaner.  So, Pablo found it on my advisor, Jennifer's desk.  I pay the $178, very unwillingly because I feel this was a horrible service to be charged when not told by ANYONE prior to having to pay it.  Well guess what after that, no one had my keys.... Pablo had to hunt them down.  They were in a technician's toolbox.  At this point I've been there an hour.  My advisor also told me that the prior two times I've bene there that it wasn't noted on either about my complaint about the noise in the front.  Geez, I guess it's my fault that prior advisors heard me say it but told me an appt had to be made to look at it.  As not only a consumer, but also as a prior service advisor for Classic Acura in Beaumont, Tx, and I also served as a warranty clerk/cashier at Autoplex 2000, I must say that this was the worse service visit ever.  Tuesdays appt with Pablo was excellent and the cashiers were also extremely nice, but this time, it was by far the worse experience I've ever had with any service department in the retail industry. I thought long and hard to contact service manager the next day, but I was so frustrated with not even getting through on the phone lines, I thought why bother. My first stop, trade-in, for an entirely different type of vehicle.  
My ratings below are based on my Service appt with Jennifer only.  I will not even go into detail at the poise and attitude of this person.

44,"October 19, 2019","My experience at Tom Peacock was great. I went in on Thursday night about 2 hours from closing. My salesman Luis Ramos was very helpful. I wanted a Maxima and he explained all the details of the car. He took me to the back of the car lot to look at different  colors and we had to actually look at the cars with the flashlight on his phone. I was very impressed. He helped me as if it was 7 am and not 7 pm. I decided on a car, took a test drive and fell in love. I was greeted by James Milton who explained all the numbers to me. My credit is not so good so I was kind of worried that I wouldn't be able to get the beauty that I wanted. I wasn't able to get that beauty but I was put in a 2019 Altima. I moved on to finance where I met Dr. Wong. Such a remarkable guy. He explained everything to me even if I asked more than once. I told my husband about my experience and he have decided to trade in his truck for  a Nissan. I wish everyone would have great customer service like these 3 guys. I will never forget them",5.0

47,"October 17, 2019","DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME HERE.  THEY ARE RUDE.My sister just left this dealership and I'm just disgusted.  My sister is hispanic and although she speaks English, she has a thick accent.  I guess by just looking at her they thought they could take advantage.  Who knows.  That being said, my sister secured financing with her credit union to finance a vehicle.  Because she's not too internet savvy and didn't want to be taken advantage of, she asked me to help her with her car search.  She wanted a Murano so I did the internet search for her and messaged three dealerships asking for out the door price for specific Muranos.  Peacock, although with the best price online, was the ONLY one that hadn't replied yet.  She took the morning and early afternoon off to look at cars but I couldn't go with her due to lack of childcare.  I told her to go there first since it's the farthest away but best price.  When she got there, a woman named Diana attended to her.  Nice lady, but when she got her to look at the Murano we wanted to see, the window sticker was missing and she said it was $46k.  When she told her the price on the internet is $23k, my sister facetimed me and Diana told ME that with fees it would be $46k.  I guess she thought we are idiots or something.  That bothered me my sister was getting taken advantage of so I made a phone call to the dealership myself.  Asked to speak to sales.  The person that picked up who refused to give her name told me she would not give me an out the door price unless I came in person.  Before I could tell her my sister was already there she said it depended on financing and even after I told her she has 3rd party financing already, she said she would NOT give me an out the door price.  Okay.  Fine.  Asked to speak to a supervisor.  She still didn't give me her name.  Got transferred to Aida, Internet Manager.  Told her the situation, she said Israel the new car manager, would take over.  In the meantime, my sister Maria Cavazos texted me telling me that Israel (the manager) kept pressuring her to apply with Nissan despite her 3rd party financing.  Which is crap.  I told her not to...they don't need to pressure her since she should be considered a cash buyer.  When she requested the OOD price, he refused.  He found out thru a coworker that I had called the dealership and proceeded to tell her he would no longer help her and just left her alone.  Then Diana came back (the original lady) and said she would give her a quote.  Several minutes passed and nothing so she just left.  I was so upset for her.  Here is a CASH buyer and they treat her like crap!!  I called back again to attempt to speak to Aida.  Asked for a OOD price.  Said she wasn't available but this lady that didn't give me her name said she would help me.  Left me on hold for 25 minutes claiming she was aware of the whole situation and would speak to a manager above Israel and then hung up.  Instead of calling back, I decided to write this review in hopes that someone looking for a Nissan does not bother going here.  Their staff is crap. No professionalism.  Over the phone OR in person.  And STILL...just checked my email again...no quote.  So sad.  What angers me the most is...and I forgot to mention before I remembered now, Israel just looked at her after asking for OOD price and said, ""I already sent it to you!  Just do the calculations yourself.""  Forget y'all.  My sister deserves so much more than this.  She's going thru a divorce and didn't need this additional stress.  28 mile drive to be treated like trash.  Thanks Peacock Nissan!",1.0

50,"October 10, 2019","I am in the market for a new, 2019 Rouge or a slightly used one.  I found two vehicles on Tom Peacock's website and sent in a request for more information.  Shortly after this, I received a call from the dealer designated ""appointment setter"".  I asked some very routine questions regarding the two vehicles and a final out the door price.  True to form as with most dealerships, they will give you very little information over the phone and she would not answer these questions.  The ""appointment setters"" only function is to get you into the dealership.  She told me both vehicles I was looking at were in stock.
I had a couple of hours before work, so I decided, against my better judgement, to go to the dealership.  I did want to get pricing and they also advertised an Amazon gift card with any test drive, so I figured..what the heck.  They even sent me an email confirming the gift card and I printed out the paperwork and took it with me to the dealership.
Upon arrival, the ""appointment setter"" put me in contact with a salesperson.  I told him what I was looking for and asked for pricing.  This is when the back and forth into their ""dark room"" started.  The salesman disappeared for a while and eventually came back out and told me the new 2019 was not in stock.  I said I'd be happy to look at the used one.  Back into the ""dark room"" he went.  He re-appeared and told me that this car was also not in stock.  We then started looking for alternatives...back into the ""dark room"" he went.  Re-appeared and told me about a 4 year old model that had just arrived and showed me that one.  I took a test drive and looked over the vehicle carefully....there were too many paint defects and it was too old for my liking.  Back into the ""dark room"" he went and I waited again.  
Then a manager appeared and asked me what I was looking for.  I told him and he stated that they had several new 2019's in stock...hmmm, interesting.  I then asked him for out the door pricing and information on a lease.  Back into the dark room, for quite a long period of time.  I even watched a whole inning of the Astro's game on their TV.  
By now I had to get going and the manager had not appeared, so I left.  About ten minutes after I left, I received a call from the original salesman and he told me he had pricing for me...""just send me your email address and I'll get the information to you.""  So I did.  
Didn't receive anything for the rest of the day.  I sent a text msg the next day telling him I was still waiting for pricing.  He text back saying he tried to email me, but, due to some Nissan privacy, whatever, it wouldn't allow him to email me the information....YEAH, RIGHT.
Several voicemails, emails and text msg's to both the ""appointment setter and the salesman went unanswered for a couple of days.  I finally reached the appointment setter and said I was still waiting for pricing and my gift card for my test drive...she said she would get with a manager and call me the next morning.
True to form, I heard nothing.  I contacted the dealership that afternoon and left a message for the appointment setter to call me back.  Again, no response.  
So, not only are they not following through with providing me pricing, but they also will not give me the gift card for the test drive. 
Stay away...very far away.",1.5

I was in a car accident was rear ended and my car was totaled. Tom Peacock Nissan had a vehicle advertised online for 11,888.00. I went there and took a look at it and test drove it. This was 5 days after the accident. Now mind you I was in extreme pain, taking muscle relaxers and pain meds and still trying to work. They took advantage of me and counted on me to not notice what they had done. I paid $1000.00 down during the signing. And did not realize they had jacked up the financing price to over $13,000.00 then added their fee's and taxes which ended up totaling over $14,000.00. The car should have been financed for $10,888.00 then added the taxes and fee's. I spoke to them today about it and they refuse to do an amended finance and resubmit to the bank. Then on top of that they said for me to leave my car after signing papers so they could certify it. So I left it there and picked it up the next day. There was about 100 miles extra on the mileage from what it was the night before when they said to leave it. So I will be contacting the Federal Trades Commission and the Attorney General and getting a lawyer. They ripped me off of more that $3,000.00.  Please be ware of Tom Peacock Nissan on 45 North. People, make sure you are buying the car at the price you should be buying it for. ",1.0

She got rude and stated, ""Ma'am, I transferred the call and I can't help they didn't answer"". After saying this, she transferred the call and this time a guy answered and asked me to hold on. I held the line for 10 minutes, he never came back to the line. I called back and told the receptionist and she clicked in my face without a word and transferred me back to service. Someone instantly out me on hold. After anther 10 minutes, the phone disconnected. Now my blood is boiling. I called back and ask to speak with a member of management, no one picked up and the phone disconnected again. I called right back because this dealership is the closet to me, plus I wanted someone to explain the service points to me, not to mention that this is the second time this has happened to me with this dealership.

72,"August 06, 2019","Nissan certified obviously means nothing to Tom Peacock Nissan.  My recent purchase of a ""Nissan certified"" used vehicle has come with unresolved issues that the dealership does not stand behind.  After stopping to get my tires aired, I was notified by the store employee that i had two bald tires, one that was almost bald, and one that was ok.  I called James Milton, my salesman, to ask if they changed the tires before selling a used vehicle.  He insisted that they did, which is not possible in my case.  I just hit five thousand miles since driving off the lot, so bald tires is NOT possible if they had been changed.  I went back to the tire shop to confirm the lack of tread on my tires to find out the tires on the vehicle were factory.  Three days later I went to Gunn Nissan to get my oil changed to find out the air filter and engine filter had not been replaced in at least twenty thousand miles.  I told them about my tires needing to be replaced, so they checked the alignment just in case.  Turns out I also need an alignment.  So again, what does Nissan certified mean to Tom Peacock?  Absolutely nothing.",2.0

102,"December 28, 2018","BUYER BEWARE (Please Read):

Because of my experience with Tom Peacock Nissan, it would be very wise for you to take photos of everything you sign (to make certain they give you ALL those papers afterwards, as they did NOT with me)  AND record ALL communications with them (within Texas law)--Otherwise, they might deceive you, as they did me!

The ONLY reason I am writing this is because I do not want to be a coward to what I know and to share it--to try to prevent my experience from happening to other prospective Nissan (or any) vehicle buyers.

I am a 60 year old female, with disabilities.  I did my research of the vehicle and what fees are negotiable, so I could save as much money possible.  On my second visit with them, I spent about 8 hours there, trying to get the best deal.  I constantly told them I absolutely would not pay nonsense fees. 

They had four employees working their game with me--or should I say against me:

1. Chris Gates, General Sales Manager: I found him to be extremely manipulative, sly, condescending, and disrespectful. 

2. Alfred Garcia, Sales Manager: I found him to lie a lot.  However, he was respectful, for the most part.  He usually joined Larkin and me in the negotiating.

* The above two men were the ones who were really in charge of this transaction.

3. Jonathan Larkin, Salesperson: I found this very young man to be a mere subordinate.  When Garcia was not with him, Larkin kept going to Garcia and Gates for answers/advice.  Larkin was kind in the beginning but passive-aggressive at the end.

4. Christopher Gomez, Salesperson: When their tactics didn't work, they brought in this guy, to no avail.  For the most part, he was professional and respectful.

They all did their best at manipulating the numbers in order to confuse me (I have all the paperwork they gave me).  However, I kept my focus and would not budge.  My hard work paid off--At the end, they took all nonsense fees off, and the total price was $28,477 plus tax.

Within a month, I looked at all the paperwork they gave me and realized there was a $349.50 discrepancy, in their favor.

I went to the finance manager, Miguel Campos, and related the discrepancy.  I showed him the paperwork he gave me, which had no mention of $349.50.  He gave me another document, which he said he thought he had given me--AND THERE IT WAS--it showed exactly the $349.50 that I was missing and not shown in the paperwork they gave me the day that I purchased the vehicle.  

The document Campos showed me stated a Dealer Service Fee of $349.50. I told him I never received that document and asked him what a Dealer Service Fee was.  He literally said that the $349.50 Dealer Service Fee was to make up for the incentives that were given to me.  I told him they were supposed to subtract it, not add it.  Mr. Campos told me to come back on Saturday--He would talk to management regarding this.

When I went back, he said that the Dealer Service Fee was a “Dealer Prep Fee.”  I told him that is not what he said the first time and told him that is a nonsense fee, which I adamantly stated I would not pay.

Hence, they would not give me the $349.50 (plus tax).

I went to a friend of mine who works for Ford, and he told me that was a nonsense fee.  I also went to Humble Nissan and they also told me that was a nonsense fee.

Mr. Campos was honest enough to tell me the truth that the $349.50 was really to make up for the incentives/discounts I received.  If he is a genuinely honest person, he will still admit this truth. 

I don't know how involved Miguel Campos was in the manipulation, besides not giving me the document that stated $349.50.  Nevertheless, I found Mr. Campos to be very kind and respectful.  Maybe I shouldn’t have, but I trusted him more than any of the others that I dealt with, at Tom Peacock Nissan.
	
However, I know that Chris Gates was involved in manipulating the numbers--till the very end!

Joe Garcia, General Manager of that store (not Alfred Garcia): I spoke with him regarding their discrepancy and deception, and he was extremely belittling, rude, very unprofessional, and sounded so uneducated. He was mocking and screaming at me, trying to intimidate me.

By the poor and unprofessional way he was talking to me, I gathered Chris Gates (and maybe others) had already talked to him about their $349.50 deception, in lieu of my incentives I received.

One Last Note: Do not take possession of your purchased vehicle when it is dark.  I did so--and later found minor body damage on it.  They did, however, buff out an area of scratches and haphazardly repaired a nick.  One other area was not repaired.  By the way, this was a “brand new” vehicle, with only 4 miles.

I originally wrote a good review about the car buying experience however when I went in for service, it was a complete nightmare. From the very beginning, no customer service at all a bunch or excuses without hearing me out. I had bought a car last week and it already needed a new tire. I told them to look to make sure it was not a defect and they just kept insisting I needed to pay without even letting me speak. I talk to a manager named Mushtag and he became aggressive and yelled at my father and I. Tina tried to make things better but overall she added more fuel to the fire... she brought me into his office to receive an apology and when I went in there he asked ""what do you want from me"" and he did see a reason to apology and then began to insult me! He started to question my age and education and then he stated he went to engineering school and said ""I am more intelligent than you"". Tina and Brandon were in the room and both refused to acknowledge the DISGUSTING way a customer was treated. When I turned to them to say if they heard what was said they acted as if he did not say any of that. I told Mushtag to not question my intelligence or insult me I stated to him I am 20 and already have my Bachelors. At that point the problem went from the car to a personal problem. I was beyond shocked.. did not know it was possible to allow leadership to INSULT customers like that. Even though Chris tried to make it right, and talked to Mushtag and gave excuses for the behavior, it was a forced apology did not mean it whatsoever. I do not recommend this Nissan dealership to anyone because of what happened to me. I like Nissan cars just did not like the disrespect and rude behavior allowed at this one. I will for sure be letting people know what happened to me here at Tom Peacock Nissan and will never spend my money buying a new car again. To wrap it up Mr. Davis in MGMT was the only person I spoke that had sense of what was going on. He was the ONLY one who acknowledged that customers should not be treated that way. As I mentioned, just so shocked and disturbed that this happened and was treated like a piss poor customer.

121,"August 27, 2018","I arrived to the dealership around 7:30 to get in line for an oil change. There was a guy who was placing pink post it notes on windshields and I was number 8. The technician in cubical 8 got me squared away in about 20 minutes. He told me that my car should be ready by 9:47 based on the sign in time. I initially declined the tire rotation due to a previous experience some years back with the workers breaking a lug nut/stud and it having to be ordered to be replaced which meant I would have to come back another time to have it put on. About 3 minutes went by and I went back to Mr. O and told him to go ahead and add it. I sat and waited which seemed like forever. Around 9:49 he came and told me my car was almost ready but that they broke/stripped/did something to (i don't recall exact words used) my lug nut/stud. I told him when I brought it in it was not like that so they needed to fix it. He called parts and then I went to sit back down.  About 15 minutes by and then he come back to tell me it will be a little while longer because they had already pulled my car out front and they would need to take it back to the back and put the part on. 
1. Why would do half complete the work and NOT replace the lug nut/stud prior to taking my car out and place me at risk of my tire possibly coming off. 
About 15 minutes later Mr. O comes back and tells me that I will have to pay the cost to replace it since they didn't do the last tire rotation. I explained to him that was unacceptable and that I wanted to speak to a manager. He never brought the manager out Mr. O just came back and told me that he spoke to the manager and I had to pay it. I told him that I no longer wanted to speak to him anymore and that to have them finish my car and provide me with the cooperate number. Once I was finished we go to the check out register and the tall worker that had on a black work shirt had a smug attitude as though I was getting on her nerves when I asked for a manger and the corporate number. I also asked her for the 21 point inspection sheet and it was not provided initially either. She told me she didn't have it and I could google it. She also told me that the manager was busy and unavailable. She went to Mr. O who never brought the paperwork back to me, I had to go an locate him to get it. After looking and not being able to find it, I finally just called the front of the dealership in which I was informed that they did not have a corporate office and were independently owned, but she placed me on hold to get a manager. During this time the smug attitude cashier had some other man who walked up to me while I was on hold, didn't acknowledge who he was, nor did he had on any name tag of any sort. He said, ""Hi"", and that was it. He stood less than 2 feet away from me with a smirk on his face and looking toward the cashier. Finally I asked him who he was and how could I help him since he didn't say anything when he walked up. He said his name was Jamie and that I was on the phone. Now I was physically holding the phone to my ear but my mouth was NOT moving. Jamie went on to say that had he done the previous work he would have covered it but because he didn't he usually didn't cover it. I explained to him that this had happened with their dealership before which made me very apprehensive about ever returning. I also explained to him that the one time a couple years ago when NTB broke or stripped the nut, they came out and said the same thing BUT they replaced it and didn't charge me for their technicians mistake. The tone in his voice was like a he didn't care BUT i wasn't backing down. After a couple of back and forth he finally just told the cashier to credit it to the shop. As I leaving I look for MR. O because I still hadn't received the inspection report So now almost 3 hour later I finally leave with yet another bad experience with this dealership. 

Upside to the story:

About an hour after I got him Mr. Ron Davis contacted me and identified himself as the new customer service manager. He listened and talked to me as though my small dollar amount spent at his location mattered. I gave him the spill of my experience and he assured me that he would be speaking to those workers involved. The fact that he did a follow up call made me smile as most place don't. It showed that he doesn't consider his customers as just a number actually values good customer service and others experiences. I was very thankful for that. From one manager to another thank you Mr. Davis I truly appreciate your over and beyond service. ",2.0

J.R. is the only reason I returned to the dealership for services. J.R. asked me to give Tom Peacock another chance and if it was not to my satisfaction, I would not have to return. J.R. made my experience a pleasant one every single time.

129,"July 24, 2018","This is a letter I sent to BBB concerning a complaint and issue I have been having with a brand new 2017 Rogue I purchased in October 2017. The car has been the shop 8 times for various issues from a warped grill, exhaust system, idle twist and adjustment, brakes on three separate occasions, seat sensor reset,  rash sensor reset, front end alignment, rotors turned, wheels rotated and this list goes on. I have contacted Nissan Morot credit and their only offer was $1500, or an extended warranty and continued repairs. 



  I reviewed some information pertaining to my 2017 Nissan Rogue. I have another concern that need to be addressed as well. 
  Upon talking to the Salesman with Tom Peacock Nissan I was told the value of my car was decreased at $15,000. The original price was suppose to be 23,000. I questioned this with the finance department. It was stated the increase was due to tax, title and license being added.        Considering the fact I was convinced to put more money down to take the balance down to $19,000 which was the price of the original vehicle I went to purchase in the beginning. This really became a concern when I went to the dealership concerning the vehicle after having multiple mechanical problems and defects with the vehicle. 
  I tried to come to a suitable agreement to try and get into another vehicle. This is when I was told the value of the 2017 Nissan Rogue I purchased “priced” at $29000 is valued at market value of $15000. So within 5 months it loss $15000 value? I decided to do some research and read reviews on not only the same vehicle but the dealership as well. It wasn’t surprising. 
  Customers went to the dealership to purchase an advertised automobile but convinced to purchase a better deal on a new car. Some around the same time after the hurricane. Vehicles were overpriced and others went through the similar situation as I encountered. 
   I ended up paying down more on the car than agreed to close the deal. I was given the runaround so many times. The vehicle I wanted was not good. My second option I picked was sold after sitting there 3 ½ hours. I was then passed to the third salesman. I became aggravated with this ping pong episode and was passed on to a different salesman. I was promised the red 2017 Nissan Rogue SE loaded with sunroof and equipped with various amenities. Another hour passed and the sales manager comes in and says sorry but they made a mistake. The other car is sold. The salesman and the sales manager went back and forth arguing about the car. They walk away to come back and say oh we made a mistake. The red car we have is a SE and it cost more. We had the wrong car. Can you put more money down maybe $3000? I dropped in the seat. Are you serious? After all this time. I was literally in tears. Let us check something else out. Don’t worry Ms. Lewis we have the perfect vehicle for you. It’s not what you wanted actually new and cost less. They come back again. We have the perfect car for you. The deal is approved but can you come back tomorrow the banks are closed. We’re going to help you out and let you take the car and complete the paperwork tomorrow. I said I want to see the car. This is when the current car I have was presented to me. I did not feel good about the car because I had been promised so many things in one night. That should have been the red flags to make me not walk away but run.
  I ended up putting more money down. They knew I was in a bad situation from the beginning. I lost two cars in the flood and the date was about to expire to turn in the rental car the insurance company was paying for. I was in dire need of a car and really at the end of my rope. I was railroaded.
  I returned to the dealership the first time and asked the salesman Jonathan, that originally sold me the car if Nissan had a return vehicle policy? His reply was no once your purchase a car there’s no returning it back. Who does that?” Followed by a chuckle. I walked away. On a different visit I asked to speak with the sales guy and finance department. The salesman was no longer with the dealership and the entire finance department had changed. The finance guy that completed my contract is no longer with Tom Peacock as well. This entire ordeal has been one big nightmare after the next. After several attempts and several calls among messages left to the General Sales Manager Mr. Gates never replied. This automobile has been one heartbreak after another. I do not want this car neither to deal with this dealership any further. After this experience and reading reviews, complaints and treatment received I do not want to conclude business with them nor Nissan. Bad business practices, defective vehicle and deceptive misleading advertisement from the start. I’m an emotional wreck. Not what they claim to be! Ripoffs, constantly changing employees and not professional.

I called ahead of time to see if they had any more of these cars in inventory to look at and seriously consider purchasing with payments in my specified price range. They said they had more than 5 so I made the trip out same day. I walked in and asked for the saleswoman I spoke with on the phone. She was with a customer, no big deal, and I was directed to another saleswoman. She was nice. I told her I wanted to explore cars concerning the special. She started talking about new altimas and deals that would put me really close to the figure I was searching for. In actuality it was a price increase from the special and an added 6.5k aka nowwhere near my desired price. She then leaves and some guy with a tough accent tries to explain the benefits of buying a new car vs the ones I specifically came into look at. Its all hoopla and hogwash. He tried to upsell me. She comes back with keys to test drive a new altima, one that I have no interest in bc I know its already out of my price range. I test drive it to get a feel anyway. We come back and they immediately get the finance operation started to sell me this brand new altima I never said I wanted. They put down a monthly payment more than 150 dollars than I told them I was looking to pay with the preowned option I wanted. I tell them I want to look at a preowned car. They get the finance manager to come back and he has a lower payment. I tell him its not going to work and I dont see how he can get the price down to the range I want bc the car is simply too expensive by default. He asked my accompanying mother if she would be willing to cosign and see if itd make the difference. They come back with a new price now 75 dollars more than the monthly payment I wanted. They try to push the sale and I refuse. He tries again to bring the price down and he does but its still 30 dollars over budget for a car I did not want. I tell them Im going to leave and take my business elsewhere. They ask what they can do to get my business and by that car. I told them I was unhappy nobody would listen to my consumer desires and didnt appreciate them trying to sell me a new car when I wanted to look at preowned from the start. Then they scramble as Im walking out and tell me they have one preowned altima left. This car was a great value and exactly what I was looking for when I came in. I mentally already decided that I wasnt giving them any of my money out of principle. The saleswoman quotes a number that was well in my price range and something I was willing to do. I briefly change my mind back into purchase mode. But this last preowned car was on hold for less than 24 hours by another customer who put a deposit down the day before. They tell me this is not an issue if I am willing to buy that day in the moment. I verbally question their business tactics and tell them I cannot move forward with this car bc it is on hold for somebody else. I shouldnt be able to know this car is even available. I couldnt find it ethical that they are taking holding deposits for customers but still selling the cars anyway. I call them out for this unethical practice and told them I cant do business with them bc they have too many underhanded sales procedures that lead me to believe the place is dishonest. The entire sales operation needs a total revamp and is nothing the dealer should be proud of. As a first time car buyer, I feel preyed on by this dealer from the jump. They didnt listen to me and lied about availability throughout the process. They tried to upsell me for their sake, never considering my needs as a comsumer. Only way I'd take my business is if they demonstrate to me a new respect for consumers and different sales practices that center around listening to consumers and responding appropiately to their needs with honesty. Just a lot of lying and schiestiness to worry about with this dealer ",1.8

When I asked about trading in my vehicle, I was told I was too upside down and that the bank wasn't asking for one. I finally drove off the lot at 8 pm with a new car. Fast forward to 03/19/18, I still hadn't heard from the bank so I called them. They told me they were waiting on documents from the dealership and then everything would be done. And that they only have 5 days to get everything in order and that was day 3.  I called back to Tom Peacock on day 5 and spoke with Mike (Finance Dept) who told me that I needed to come back and re-sign some papers because the interest rate was too high. He had no idea I already knew it was too late and the time frame had expired.  I went back up there on 03/24/18, and was told by Mike that  I needed a trade in and/or let my co-signer be the only name on the contract. But that's not what was told to me in the beginning Mike... He tells me that I should just return the car because it was a bad deal and I should have never been able to drive off the lot. So I left there and immediately got approved for another car at a more professional dealership.  From that point on I called and emailed requesting them to come pick up the car and not even the General Manager (Mr. Garcia) ever responded or called me. Not until 03/30/18 did they come get the car. Let's not forget they promised the co-signer $500 for running the credit and being added to the vehicle. Needless, to say they are now claiming they can't pay it due to the deal being bad. BUT NEVER TOOK RESPONSIBILITY ON THE FACT IT IS THEIR FAULT DUE TO FALSIFYING THE CONTRACT!!!  They had a sale going on Altima's until 03/19 on which they did everything they could to get them off the lot. Before my co-signer left, Mike Zimmerman (Finance Manager) had the audacity to request a re-stocking fee and payment for the mileage on the vehicle. SERIOUSLY?????  HOUSTON PLEASE THINK TWICE BEFORE SHOPPING AT THIS UNPROFESSIONAL, UNTRUSTWORTHY DEALERSHIP. THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER NISSAN DEALERSHIPS THAT CAN GET YOU WANT YOU WANT WITHOUT FALSIFYING CONTRACTS AND PLAYING GAMES. JUST LOOK AT ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS. IT'S REAL!",1.0

They completely ignored my request and washed my vehicle. Surprise I have a huge new scratch in my paint and they absolutely denied that their machine did it. So I get to leave with a huge scratch in my paint and they get to keep my money. Do NOT bring your car here. You will regret it.

I have for many years been a devotee of Nissan Products and have dealt with some marginal dealers.

Needless to say, Bob is the consummate professional who avoids the nonsense indicative of so many auto sales staff in many dealerships.

196,"November 05, 2017","I had a bad experience in this dealership.  I bought a Nissan Versa 2016 with only 13,500 miles two months ago and the car had an issue right out the dealership that I didn't notice right away. Once I brought the car back to the dealer they didn't want to take responsibility but the worse part was the customer service not just from  the employees but the managers as well. When we talked to the manager he brought us the car fax and we notice the car was brought in when it had only 181 miles for the ailment service, we believe the car had issues from the start but we were not notified of this when we bought the car. Now I have to pay 1,500 since the dealer didn't want to take responsibility and buy both of the rear tires so the car can be in good condition. For this reason I do not recommend this dealership.

Ms. Gordon in service stated that if I was requesting a certain service to be done that they would do that and I would not be charged. The tech Feliz quoted me a different price and I asked that they just do install and program ONLY!!!! I was still charged and they still did a diagnostic test which I did not receive nor did they explain if they found anything else wrong. When I spoke with the manager today he was rude and said I agreed for them to do the test and that they would credit my account which all I want is a refund of the $120 that I was charged.. I will not be going back to this dealership for service on my car they do not listen to customer when they ask something not be done. Mr. Munoz in parts was really friendly and helpful and was there when I said what I wanted done to my car. Even on the receipt only says labor charge and does not have how much I was actually charged for install and programming. The cashier was even confused so I feel as if they scammed me and it's not fair especially since I'm a single mother and all I needed was what I asked when I already knew what the problem was.....,2.2

Spoke with Julia Rodriguez over the phone and confirmed I would be using my own finance and the price of the car at 24K. Drove 8 hours and met with salesman Bob Boragine. We were close to settling on 24K when I met with manager Mike Nash who advised me the price would now be 25K because I was using my own finance. I was upset but offered to meet in the middle at 24, 500. Bob then informed me the price was now 26, 100 not 25,000 that they just offered. I left and called back later explaining I was upset and spoke with manager Gus San Andres. I asked if they would work with me because I loved the car. Gus then offered 26,900 explaining there were dealer fees and thats the best he could do. In the meantime they changed the internet price from 23,999 to 27,900. Finally, Gus offered 26,900 and I declined. I go on the internet today and the Audi is now 26,900 online after Gus advised me that was him making good on everything",1.0
211,"December 06, 2016","I am a returning customer at Tom Peacock Nissan. On Friday 11/18/16 I went to get an oil change on my 2013 Nissan Altima. While there I decided to inquire about a 2016 Maxima that I saw on their website. I advised the salesperson that I received a pre-approval in the mail. He left then & returned with the pre-approval notice & said they would work the numbers based on that pre-approval. He then returned with his brother Raul, & said he would be assisting him in this sale. At that time I didn't understand but came to realize he was passing me off to his brother to take over the sale. Before he left I advised him that Mr. Calvin Williams had assisted me for the purchase of my current vehicle. I then spoke with Calvin and Raul and Calvin insisted that I complete the loan application so that he could try another bank. He advised me that he would only be submitting the application to ONE bank. That was a lie. Next Mr. Aaron Rush, the finance manager, asked me into his office, I had been passed off to another person again. He then showed me the breakdown of what the cost of the car would be and what my monthly note would be. The vehicle was priced for more than what it was listed as online so Mr. Aaron adjusted the price to match. I then advised him that I had $250 one to one sales points so he added that to the deal. I then agreed to the terms which were out of my price range but close. I then asked if I could look at the vehicle one more time. Mr. Rush asked if I had test driven it and I told him no, which he was shocked to hear. He then had the vehicle pulled around for me to look at. Upon inspecting the vehicle there were some scratches around the vehicle that had me concerned. I expressed my concern to Mr. Aaron and pointed them out. He stated that they were from when the car arrived & they pulled the plastic off. He told me that it would be taken care of before I left with the vehicle. We then went back inside to finalize the deal and he went to run it by his manager & returned to inform me that I couldn't use the one to one points towards the purchase. Mr. Rush told me that the points could be used towards a purchase in the parts and accessories department. He directed me to finance to sign the contract. That's when Raul returned to tell me that service had locked my keys away & I would not be able to get my things out of my car. I had my purse & house keys in there. So I had to return the next day to get them. I ended up having to stay with someone that night because I didn't have my house keys to get in. I was then informed that the loan would be through NMAC. This made me upset because there was no reason to run my credit 4 times with different banks if we were just going to go through my pre-approval with Nissan anyway! I signed the contract and then met with the final person in delivery. Upon looking at my ""New"" car I noticed the car wash was rushed and there were more scratches than I noticed before, also a missing part on my passenger door handle and a dent in the rear bumper. I was very dissatisfied!!! Mr. Rush said that these would be taken care of & it was not. I then expressed my issue with the delivery personnel & she went to get a manager. Ozzy advised me to return the next day & that it would be taken care of. I returned the next day to get my things out of my trade-in and saw Mr. Rush & told him my issue with my ""New Car"". He then went to see what he could do about it and told me to return on Monday and that he would be there by 7:30 am with a loaner car  ready for me & they would take care of the scratches, the missing piece, the dent and the window tint. I arrived that Monday morning around 7:45 am and there was no one in sales there. My Altima that I traded in was still sitting in the front of the dealership where I left it Saturday morning. I waited approx 20 min before Mr. Rush arrived, and then waited for the loaner. I called the parts department to inquire about using my points Mr. Rush said I could use there & they advised me that I couldn't. At this point I am extremely dissatisfied!! I picked up my car that same day only to find there was still a dent in my bumper ,scratches & had to return yet again for it to be fixed. I made an appt for Friday 12/2. I dropped my car off expecting to pick it up the same day only to find out it wouldn't be ready til Monday. I told Mr. Rush I need to get my things out of my car for work on Monday morning. Before arriving I received a call from Mr. Rush asking me where my badge for work was so that he could get it. I told him I wanted to get my things myself. When I arrived Mr. Rush handed me my work badge after a JUST told him not to go through my personal belongings, that I wanted to get it myself. Furious, I asked him to just return my car. He then goes off to do other things and Mr. Calvin goes to bring my car around & brings someone else's car! He then brings my car & they hadn't done ANYTHING to it.

When I asked the finance guy about the extra charges he said he did not know anything about it and that it was brought to him like that. That's very interesting to me because that's your job to look at numbers all day and I noticed so I know he did. Moving along to delivery which was a joke because they did not show us any of the features of the car. They handed us the keys and said they will contact us when we can get the Rogue painted which was agreed they would fix (plus they added on to the price of the car - $1200). So then after we dropped the car off for 4 days we get it back and they used regular white touch up paint on the Pearl white Rogue. They waited to see if we would see it or say something I guess because I am sure there are check points to pass to deliver it back to a customer. I live across town which is far to be driving back every week because you failed to provide at least good customer service that is expected (not great). Trying to talk to the delivery manager Steve is one of the hardest things to do especially when his vmail is full and he rarely answers the phone.,1.6
220,"July 30, 2015","I sold my vehicle to this dealership but took them more than a month to pay me for it. Poor business in terms of customer relationship. Will never go back to this dealership..me and my family. If you're looking for a decent relationship, i would go to Honda of Spring. Just my 2 cents. ",1.0

223,"January 07, 2015","I bought a Nissan Leaf from this dealer recently.  I chose this dealer because their internet prices were the lowest of any Nissan dealer in Houston.  After I decided to buy the Leaf, I discovered that the dealer charged me two destination charges (mandatory $850 on sticker price, plus an additional $875 on dealer quote).  I asked the finance director why I was paying for two destination charges (which was not disclosed to me during the sale).  He told me this is part of the internet pricing.  The sales director then came to the finance director's office and explained that included in the discount I received was $875 discount for the additional destination charge.

In conclusion, I feel that Tom Peacock Nissan overcharged me on the dealer fees (duplicate destination charge), and justified it by saying I received a discount to offset the duplicate destination charge.  However, I was not told this fact until I discovered the duplicate destination charge, after I had already signed the paperwork to purchase the vehicle.  Be wary of the discount offered on the internet by this dealer.  It might be misleading, if the dealer ends up overcharging for dealer fees.",3.0

Luis Toledo was avid in making sure I had all the other bases covered as well. I never once felt pressured or rushed to make a decision. I highly recommend this dealership!

234,"March 28, 2014","The staff was very friendly and professional. They answered my questions and listened to my concerns. Before I came to Tom Peacock I went to Fred Haas I did not have a pleasant experience there. However when I drove up at Nissan Mr. Short greeted me and asked me how could he be of assistance. I explained that I had a couple of concerns because of my experience down the street he apologized and told me he would do the best he could. He introduced me to Mr. Otavia Ward the floor manager and then Mr. Fidel Garcia These guys did a wonderful job A+. I must say all of the staff carried themselves in a very professional manner and although it was 9 am when I arrived all of the gentlemen who attended the morning meeting said Good Morning. I was impressed from the car maintenance guys to the guy who orders parts polite and accessible.

235,"January 18, 2014","This happened on 1/18/2014.  This was definitely not my first go-round as far as purchasing a vehicle.  I contacted Peacock after viewing their inventory.  I called about a Mercedes 2010 GLK 350 for our daughter.  She specifically told the salesman Walter in the conversation that we were coming from about 60 miles away in bad traffic (about 1 1/2 hrs) and wanted to make sure:
1.  whether the vehicle was there
2.  to confirm purchase price
3.  of any surprises in the purchases price. 

He advised the car was there, he confirmed the purchase price and told me ""no surprises"" as far as additional add-on costs other than tax/license-which we already knew the tax rate.  After driving for approx. 45 minutes, my daughter's phone started blowing up with calls from ""unknown"" numbers.  She finally answered the last one and it was the salesman-Walter.  He told her that ""someone"" had called about the vehicle and he could not hold it for her.  We were literally 15 minutes away at about 6:30pm on Friday.  He wanted to confirm that she was coming.  She told him our ETA and he said okay.  

We got there and he took us to see the vehicle and drive it.  It drove fine, daughter ""liked"" it..didn't love it (it did not have some of the features) but wanted to talk to him.  We get into his office and he shows us his computer screen of the exact thing we saw on ours at home and then gave her a piece of paper that had an ""additional"" 2K (approx) added charge.  I asked what that was and he said it was a ""mandatory reconditioning fee"".  I asked what that was and he said it was to detail and make sure the vehicle met ""their"" standards.  He then started pointing to the website add where it said in ""very small print""------""and fees"".  WOW.  Complete deal breaker. Never dreamed, ""and fees"" could be 2K.   His ""boss"" came in and I told his boss exactly what I thought about this tactic and asked that we give them some time and they both left the office.  We sat there for about...2 minutes and walked out.  

As we were pulling out, his boss came up to my side of the car and told me that the ""best"" he could do was to ""reduce"" the ""mandatory"" recondition fee to $500.  Knowing that the ""discounted"" $1500 would come out somewhere in the financing, I told him no--also told him that he should be ashamed of himself for conducting business this way.  He told me that ""they"" had someone already wanting to purchase the vehicle and there was a ""tow truck"" just waiting to take the vehicle!  I told him to sell it-but not to us.  I really feel that they thought we would just suck it up and pay this ""extra"" stupid fee b/c we had already driven so far.  Also noticed that at approx. 7:30pm there were alot of people just sitting in Peacock's very comfortable sitting area-always knew that if a dealership has plush sitting chairs and if there are alot of customers (about 15 this Friday night) sitting at that time of night means something is wrong and the longer it takes to get financed the worse the deal is)--just my opinion based on years of buying vehicles.  Just Beware of the ""recondition fee""--Theresa Henry

BTW-daughter purchased a 2010 GLK350 (with everything she wanted--i.e. panoramic sunroof etc) from  dealership in San Antonio-Jordan MotorCars, for less then then this vehicle and did the entire deal over text messaging!!!  Went the next night to San Antonio to pick it up..great people over there.  NO SURPRISES :)",1.5
236,"July 22, 2013","This is the worst dealership in my opinion. From Top to Bottom they don't care about your business including the customer relations guy Sam. I had been dealing with a sales agent who was quite nice, test drove a pathfinder while having my nissan serviced there. I saw a commercial same night for an advertized sale price of a pathfinder. I went there first thing in the morning to see if they had it available, They did. I test drove it and sat down ready to buy it. The sales manager Calvin wouldn't honor the sale price from the advertizement and couldn't give me an explanation why they couldn't match the price. 
I called the sales manager Juan Morales, then louise Toledo...Both several times...these gentlemen don't believe in returning the phone calls even I left both of them several messages. They simply don't care. This dealer ship is not run very well. I don't thing the owners know what is going on and how the people they hired effect and reflect upon dealers reputation.
I felt bad for my sales rep Mel. He did a good job but did not get his commission because of the people that are set in charge. No customer service in my opinion. DO NOT buy from this dealer. I ended up going to Fred Haas Nissan and ended up buying the pathfinder for 1700 less then Tom peacock and they gave me a free mini Ipad. 
I even called before buying from Fred Haas and talked to customer relations guy name Sam to no avail. He made it sound like he was the right person to talk to but in the end gave me a story about the commercial was a mistake and that they have a disclaimer in place for such ads. What a joke!!
Low and behold I was watching channel two news at ten last thursday and they run the SAME commercial again!!
Poor Poor management and no regards for customer who was ready to buy and lived only 2 miles from the dealership. Now I will drive extra even for service becasuse I do not like the way they handled and lied from top to bottom.

237,"October 04, 2012","Terrible experience - Walk in to purchase a new Passenger NV and was presented with a bill $1500 over list.  I complained that I can order it online cheaper at list price. He explained it was hard to get this car (all he was doing was ordering it) After getting up to leave the car was discounted about $500.00.  Paid a deposit on my credit card, never got a receipt showing exactly what I ordered.  Said I would receive first thing in the morning - I have called 5 time no one is available or present to talk with me.  Extremely unprofessional - Please if at all possible go somewhere else.",1.3
238,"December 29, 2011","In this day and age it's nice to know that the 'bait and switch' tactic is still being employed in automotive sales.  We were lured into the dealership because of an internet inquiry made through Nissan.com.  They said they had a new 2012 for the same price as a new 2011 and we thought, ""That deal is too good to be true but who lies these days with the internet and the way information spreads? This would be ridiculously stupid as it'll only take a couple people getting this kind of treatment before they become the least reputable dealer out there and get shut down by Nissan!"" 

Well ladies and gentleman, I present the most shady dealership I've dealt with the weeks I've spent researching and shopping for cars.  They lured us in confirming again and again that they were talking about the 2012 for the price and not the 2011 and when we got there, test drove the car, gave them our info for a credit run, they say, ""OH OOPS, We made a clerical mistake.""  First it was the inventory guy and then even the manager on duty joined in.  THE MANAGER.  THE one man who's supposed to be trying to ensure customer satisfaction.  NISSAN - TAKE A NICE HARD LOOK AT THIS DEALERSHIP AND SEE WHO IS DISTRIBUTING YOUR VEHICLES.

We were warned even by other dealerships the deal was too good to be true and we knew it too deep down but we believe in the genuine honesty of men.  BUT apparently our faith was misplaced.  Future buyers beware: this place is genuinely shady and you'll get screwed: one way or another.",1.0
