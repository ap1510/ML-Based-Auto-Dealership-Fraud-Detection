0,"February 19, 2019",I had a great experience buying a 2013 Ram from Barrett in sales and Isaac in finance. I came from Amarillo for a better deal. Truck Town's prices are very competitive and they let me use a loaner vehicle so they could inspect my new truck to make sure it was ready to hit the road. No hassle no hard sell. I tell everyone to go to Truck Town Lamessa. ,5.0
1,"November 29, 2017","Horrible staff, a bunch of little kids in their mid to late 20's acting like teens, even the 30+ acting like teens, everything is a joke to these kids, extremely unprofessional, its payton place. So if thats the environment you want to conduct your next car deal in, then heck its a party over there, but if you actually want to be serious and have knowledgeable and professional sales people and managers, then I would highly recommend a short drive into either Lubbock or Midland I would stay as far away as possible, if buying a vehicle being educated, and having a professional experience is important. And the NO HASSLE NO HAGGLE thats a joke there is now more mark up in their vehicles then there was before, and you can bet your last dollars that your trade in, you will get a minimum of 2 to 3 thousand more for it if you go to a different chevy, gmc, buick, cadi store, the software they use to evaluate your trade is 100% designed to ""steal your trade"" and buy it from you as cheep or cheeper then they can get it at auction for, do not be fooled when they bring you out the booksheets showing you that you are getting a fair deal on your trade or theirs, those sheets are printed out of their software designed as tools for the salesperson to deceive you and get you to agree.... How do I know all of this ..I have  20 years in the car business as a senior manager and thats just what they do,  every single dealership that goes to a 1 pricing model no hassle no haggle they have to make money or the can not pay the bills or employees. Just stop and think about it for a second ""best price on vehicle and best price for trade means no profit for dealer"" you ARE NOT getting best price or anywhere near it!!!!",1.0
2,"April 04, 2016","I can not say anything bad about this dealership.  I called them from Chicago.  Trey Osborne (salesman) sent me a pic of every blemish he could find on the truck.  We settled on a price and they held it for me.  Even though they had me where they wanted me since I had just spent money on a 1 way ticket, rental car, and hotels I did find something I wanted.  There was a vibration in the front and asked for them to check the balance on the front tires.  Their response ""My manager said you safety is important to us and having them checked is no problem"".  ",5.0

8,"April 26, 2014","We purchased our 2014 GMC Acadia from Benny Boyd GM Superstore in Lamesa, Texas . Highly reccommend this dealership if you are 

looking to buy a new or used vehicle. Billy Hogg is a great Salesman that sold my 2 daughters their vehicles about 3 years ago and now he has 

sold us ours. Benny Boyd will give you a good deal and stand by the maintainence agreement, service your vehicle when you set up an 

appointment, and make it an enjoyable experience. Everyone was very nice and pleasant. Thank you Billy and Benny Boyd for the great 

service.",5.0
9,"March 11, 2014","Horrible service. Do not buy from Benny Boyd. My car is still under warranty and they have been unable to fix it after many attempts and many months of going back and forth.  Now they will not take my car back to have it serviced and my calls never get returned.  They have neither fixed or replaced my car.  I was forced into buying the 2 year extended warranty, and now they wont even repair the vehicle.  Took the car to have it repaired many times and each time the car comes back in worse condition.  They do not know what they are doing at all. The Lubbock Manager Walker, avoids you and does nothing to fix the situation.  Horrible dealership, they finally said they would swap cars with us but instead they ran our credit through every possible bank you could think of then told us they would only swap us to a $30,000 car.  So we are still stuck with our broken vehicle and no one has done anything about this.

10,"February 22, 2014","Went to three other dealerships to inquire about purchasing a new 2014 GMC Sierra 2500HD w/8' bed, but none of them had what I was asking about (or tried to sell me something else in their inventory).

When I drove up to Benny Boyd GMC in Lamesa, Texas, they had the ""EXACT TRUCK I HAD BEEN LOOKING FOR"" parked by their front door (A Good-Sign)!

And, being a disabled veteran with walking issues, this was not only a ""Good-Sign"" but that this was the right place!!
And my salesman had just returned from lunch and parked close to the vehicle (another good-luck sign)!!!

I was so happy and totally satisfied with the service that I received when purchasing the 2014 GMC Sierra 2500HD that returned two days later and purchased another GMC product!!!!",5.0
11,"March 29, 2013","I purchased 7 brand new vehicles (Well over 1/4 million dollars within a month) from this dealership and without writing you a book of the events that occured, their customer service from their corporate office, down to the joke of a service department, everyone was completely ignorant and beyond rude.  These people are snakes in the grass and don't care one bit about their customers.  If I spent that much money at their dealership, imagine how they will treat someone who buys only one.  Customer Service & Integrity is NOT in their book of rules!",1.4
12,"September 16, 2012","this is the sequence of events that has led to this catostrophe that has left me without a vehicle and no money to fix it and I am still making payments on it. 

Facts are this-  9 months after purchase in September, I have had two major failures: totaling over $8000 in issues.
it took 2 months and 1 day till the vehicle was running again
 
Transmission failure at 6 weeks and 7000 miles after purchase 
total engine failure at 9 months and 17000 miles after purchase
radiator fan
radiator fan support  

i would not recommend any dealer with www.bennyboyd.com for buying either used or new after this purchase.  
i have stage 2 bone cancer and couldnt afford the extended warranty  words do not make companies, actions do.",1.0
13,"January 19, 2012","We bought a used car from Benny Boyd Lubbock. It was fine on the lot, and then a few days later it started to smoke when we started it. We also noticed it was using antifreeze and engine oil once every few days. We took it back in and asked them to fix it. They said they would send it to Lamesa, TX to have it worked on. They called a few days later saying it was ready to go. We had already talked to the service manager in Lamesa, and he said that they didnt do anything to it. Our salesman called and said it was ready. We told them to get it back and get it fixed now! They took it back, and about a week later they said it was ready again, and that nothing was wrong with it. We went to pick up the car and it was smoking bad non-stop. We told them we were not gonna take the car. We said to get it fixed, and they said they were not going to. We bought a powertrain warranty for 2 years, and 25,000 miles. Randall the manager said they would not honor the warranty unless the motor completly blew up. He also said he wished the engine would blow so it could get fixed. We threatened to get a lawyer and contact the BBB. He said we signed a AS-IS contract and drove it of the lot so we are screwed. I dont appreciate the way Randall spoke to My wife or my father. I would suggest to not buy a used car from Benny Boyd in Lubbock. We are stuck paying 15,000 dollars for a car the uses a gallon of antifreeze, and a quart of oil a week. Thanks Benny Boyd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1.0
14,"April 04, 2009","Alex answered all our questions on the phone to our satisfaction. He returned our calls as he promised in a very short time. He was very kind and courteous to us when we arrived at the dealership amd throughout our stay. He was very knowledgeable about the vehicle we were intrested in. No high pressure sales pitch. We arrived late in the afernoon and someone stayed late to clean and get the car ready for us.
Mark was courteous and kind to us as well when we did the paper work.
Overall it was a very good experience. I would do business with this dealership again. Richard and Janet Wilde

15,"March 09, 2009","We drove on the lot and received attention from the beginning of the transaction to the end. The quality/professionalism was as good/better than any I have experienced to date. Everyone involved was honest, friendly and sought to deliver the best product for the least amount of money possible.
In addition, the vehicle was brought to my home in Midland, late one evening at no charge and with the same professional manner experienced at the dealership. Outstanding.

16,"March 07, 2009","I am just completely frustrated with this dealership. This is a followup to a previous review I did when I bought the vehicle from them...I wont rehash those issues here.....you can read them yourself. Since that last review I have been driven to a whole new level of frustration with this dealer. Two weeks ago they told me they had sent my paperwork to the local MVD. So like an idiot I went to the MVD and waited in line for 1 1/2 hours, when I finally get to the front, they have NOTHING from this dealer!!! Further, my temp tag is out the next day...but the MVD folks tell me they can give me a new temp tag, all I need is my paperwork to show I bought he vehicle. Well guess what??? Benny Boyd hadnt sent that either!!! I got hold of Weatherman on friday and he told me the temp tag was still ok even tho the date on it was out of time but they had sent my title and paperwork to the wrong town!! They would get it back and have it sent to me next day Fed EX on Monday. I then asked him where my paperwork was.....he would have to track that down. I then get an e mail from Jimenez the next monday telling me the paperwork was in the mail to my PO Box. So I give it three days. I figured thats enough time for an OVERNIGHT sent on MONDAY!!! I go back to the MVD on Thursday and wait in line again for an hour (all MVD's are like this I hear...you wait for hours) I get to the front......you guessed it.....nothing from Benny Boyd!!! I am totally pissed now. I go check my mail for paperwork so I can at least get a new temp tag. NOTHING!!! I have a pickup with an expired temp tag and nothing from the dealer that says I bought it! The MVD calls me friday and says the title and check came in so I can get my tags.....so now I go wait another hour to FINALLY get a tag. Friday the paperwork FINALLY came in the mail also. So...on March 6...I FINALLY got everything....Gee...it only took them a month. Lets see.....I spent 3 1/2 hours in the MVD waiting in line....I couldnt drive my pickup for one week because it had an expired temp tag and I had no paperwork to prove I didnt steal it. If they REALLY believed in customer service as they claim they would have DRIVEN that paperwork to my door and handed it to me....after they sent it to the wrong town!! But no...they left a customer hanging...they already had their money out of me. ",2.5
17,"February 12, 2009","Alex was very respectful and precise in his dealing with me, I was very satisfied with all the efoort used to put me into the vehicle of my choice. I highly recommennd him to anyone looking to buy a new or used vehicle from Benny Boyd Auto!.. Thanks.",5.0
18,"February 11, 2009","Alex Jimenez was very helpful.  He answered all my questions about the vehicle's performance.  At the dealership, he showed me all the features of the car.  We even went on a test drive so that he could show me more features and how to work them.  He was very polite and I got in and out in a timely manner.  I would definitely recommend the Benny Boyd dealership and would buy from them again.",5.0

20,"January 02, 2009",The new car did not come with an owner's manual.  It will take about 2 weeks for the dealership to receive and they will forward it to me.  I do think that maybe I could have received a little more for my trade-in.  Alex was a great to work with.  Not pushy at all!,4.6
21,"January 02, 2009",i was very impressed the salesman kept in contact with me and worked a very good deal for me as well as a freind and a few family members. I am very pleased with the vehicle i purchased.  I have recomended this dealership to several people and they have been very pleased as well. ,4.2
22,"December 22, 2008","I have had VERY BAD dealings with car salesmen before, and quite frankly I was expecting this time to be no different. I had heard good things about Benny Boyd before we even started looking for a new vehicle.
I have to say from start to finish I was throughly impressed with my entire SALES experience.
I first made contact with Alex via the internet, and it really saved us a lot of time doing that since we live in Lubbock. He was very helpful, and was willing to do whatever he needed to do to earn our business.
The car that we had intended to buy was no longer available when we got to Lamesa, so to make up for it Alex, and his manager were more than willing to go above and beyond to make sure we were satisfied. They did this by giving us the same price on a comperable vehicle. 
While we had some issues with the finance department, and return phone calls I would return to Benny Boyd again. The internet sales manager Mike McGuire was wonderful. He personally took care of our concerns, and made sure that we were satisfied with the outcome. He went above and beyond to correct the problems we encountered. ",4.8
23,"December 21, 2008","Benny Boyd Dealership had the vehicle we were looking for.  All of the Staff were friendly, pleasant and very easy going.  Brian was a great salesman, we had our new GMC that afternoon with ""no hassles"".  We were not pressured at all, it was a very easy process with our trade in and our new truck.  Thanks to Brian, we have a new truck that we love.",5.0
24,"December 19, 2008","I would like to thank you(Benny Boyd GM Super Store Dealership)and your Team. I first was looking on your web sight and found it to be one of the best that I looked at. It truly showed me quality information on and about your inventory. There were no games to play and was very business like. I found a vehicle I liked and it gave me the information I wanted to know before I called your Agency and ask for new car sales and found Paul Radford who help me throughout the whole process. He did a great job, and I thank him very much. I was treated with respect and there were no games played with me during my purchase experience. Throughout the car purchase experience I worked with different folks and they were great too. I would recommend your Dealership to my friends.

Thanks for your help. ",5.0
25,"December 14, 2008","Called about a truck online and drove 45 min to meet with Brian Bruce.  Was welcomed right away. Truck was right up front and sent to be washed. Was told before I arrived that the truck had hail damage and he wanted me to see it before it was washed and after,then I could make the final decision about buying the truck.  Brian explained everything to me and answered all questions.  He was very patient and understanding.  I was impressed with the service and appreciated not being treated like I didnt know about vehicles. Car dealers and gun shops are usually the same when it comes to females walking in and wanting to do business.  I really enjoyed buying at Benny Boyd with Brian.  I will return for my next truck and have recommended them to several people in Midland.


Thanks again,

28,"December 06, 2008","Paul, Is a very good sales person He let me decide what I want and was not pushy. I have been a GM owner 30 years or more and remain loyal. Paul is very courteous and has the same attitude that I have and that is GM cars and trucks which I have both of sell on there own. If it were not for Paul and the staff at Benny Boyds (and that includes the service dept.)I would shop else where.

34,"November 18, 2008","I had a good experience overall.  I was impressed by the friendliness of the salesman.  I did want a little better price or at least something extra thrown in for buying the truck, but they did not budge on any of it.  I was also disappointed in the spatters of bed liner (or something) on the passenger side of the truck, but David said if I would bring it in they would make it right.  Overall, i would definitely recommend Benny Boyd to my friends.  ",4.6

Alex was able to get me pretty much everything I was wanting at the price I was wanting. He was very helpful and very polite to work with. I have already recommended your dealership to some of my friends and I have told them to ask specifically for Alex Jimenez.
