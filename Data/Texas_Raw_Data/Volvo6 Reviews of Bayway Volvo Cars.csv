I was told - twice- an accessory was standard by a 2 year Volvo salesperson, and then had to pay for it, after buying car because I discovered it wasnt included with it.. Car  delivered with damage on it- not inspected, obviously. Did get them to fix it, after having to  decline a bottle of paint to fix my brand new Volvo paint chips, on my own.  Complete hassle getting any service and after market services done- called 25 times- many with messages- and had to escalate to manager. The only thing they did quickly and aggressively, was to try to sell additional packages to you. Also, you can not buy a car from them without accepting a $290 up charge for putting your serial number on the driver side windshield- this was not in our online quote and did not help on insurance, as they suggest it will. So, detailed configuration and quote ignored.",1.4
1,"February 25, 2019","My sales person was James Jackson whom I refer to as the ""magic man"" because he was able to get me into the vehicle I wanted when other dealerships could not. He worked hard on my behalf and even offered to pick me up from the airport because I was coming in from out of town. Both the online and in person experiences were very positive and I am a happy customer.",5.0

3,"May 24, 2018","I purchased a brand-new 2018 XC90 Momentum T6 AWD from Bayway Volvo. The salesperson was Bruce Hall. Though the purchase price was good, the post-sales customer care was not. Six months into the ownership, my XC90 leaked all of its A/C Freon. The car was mostly stored in garage and not driven a lot (only 250 miles after 6 months). I took the car to another Volvo dealer that is closer to us for service. After a week of tracing and dismantling of most internal parts (dash, seats, trims, carpet, center console, etc.) they found the culprit: It was a leaky HVAC evaporator.

For this issue to happen in a technically brand-new Volvo XC90 is a major disappointment. To see the parts thrown around in the car, oil stains on the Blond leather seats, and scuffs on door scuff plates,  trims, dash, pillars is a heartache. I knew that I would never want to take back this car, even if it was fixed. Once you have taken apart the dash and most everything else inside the car, they can never be put back in the same factory condition. So I contacted Volvo Customer Care and requested a new replacement and/or corporate buyback. I then contacted Bruce asking him if there was anything he could do to help facilitate a buyback or a new replacement. He simply responded that I was doing the right thing by escalating this issue to Volvo Customer Care and shrugged off. I have not heard back from him and that was a month ago.

I would not buy another car from Bayway Volvo or Bruce Hall.",2.8
4,"October 27, 2016","I've owned my brand new, 2017 Volvo XC90 for LESS than 1.5 months and I've brought it in twice! ...and the problem is still there! My muffler has been making loud popping noises and my car has been squeaking while driving. Naturally, you'd think that you could call the dealership and have them help you. NOPE, instead Bayway does NOT stand by their product or warranty, instead, they will come up with convenient excuses like ""we'll notify corporate of your problem and wait to hear on why your car is making these noises"". Service department is just as wretched as well. Leaving a message on your voicemail right before you leave (bc you're avoiding the conversation) is weak customer service. Specifically, the service department could be trained better on repairing Volvo vehicles. One too many times, the service techs would tell me that they simply didn't know how to fix certain defects on my Volvo XC90 because it was ""too new"". Well, if a Volvo dealership tells you they aren't knowledgeable on how to fix their own product then we're in deep trouble, aren't we? 

This is the most disappointing experience we've ever had with a dealership. ",1.0
5,"September 24, 2013","Originally visited Bayway Volvo in August to look at a Volvo S60 T5.  Worked with Greg Rodrigues who helped pick a car and walked me through the process.  Once I got to finance, got cold feet and thought maybe that car wasn't the right fit.  Left the dealership without the purchase and felt I wasted everyone's time, including my own.  Knew I wanted a S60, but 2013 models were getting slim, and the 2014 models were just trickling in.
Talked with Greg over the next couple of weeks before I found a 2013 S60 R Design at another dealership.  Greg agreed to contact that dealership and make arrangements to procure the car.  The car arrived late one evening and Greg patiently waited for me to arrive and stayed after hours walking me through the features of the car.
The next week Greg contacted me to make arrangements for me to get a late arriving spare key and owner's manual.  Am new to this Volvo game, but if my experience with Bayway and Greg Rodrigues is typical of Volvo purchases, won't be my last.
