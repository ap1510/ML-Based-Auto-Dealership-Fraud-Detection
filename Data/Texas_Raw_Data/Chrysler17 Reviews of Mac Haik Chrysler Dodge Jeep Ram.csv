0,"May 26, 2020","On a state wide search for a specific Jeep in a specific color and set up, I found it nearly 300 miles away from me at this Mac Haik in Houston. With this new way to buy online I assumed it would bypass the whole BS of dealing with a salesman and the long waits with that good old back and fourth that one would normally experience at the Steelership. Not at all. Not online at all! Not only do you still have to deal with BS but they claim they are too busy because the dealer is full. So I’m on the phone ready to purchase, what difference does it make if I am in the dealer in person or over the phone? For them you on the phone have no turn and they think you just gonna sit by the phone all day waiting for them. I got rid of the 1st rude and disrespectful salesman and then requested another one. It started well, I explained and he said he would get it done and have the vehicle ready for me to pick it up in a couple of days.  What ? I haven’t seen a single number, and I want to get this done now! So after some back and fourth of him trying to again, set me aside to help someone there, he said he would get the numbers. Surprisingly he called back within 10 minutes but the numbers were off. Almost $3k off. Then going over the numbers he throws in some package with this and that yadda yadda, só I said no thanks. I don’t want that package. He had the audacity to tell me it’s mandatory! Haha make me laugh. Does this salesman live in China? Mandatory? I don’t have to buy anything I don’t want to buy. He said it’s in the fine print. I asked him to direct me to this fine print, no where to be found on their website. In other words, a scam!! They have the price of the vehicle, the rebates and fine print about rebates and stuff.  O thing mentioning anything about a mandatory BS package with a bunch of stuff I don’t want. I asked to speak with a manager, but he wouldn’t transfer me. He said he would ask the manager, I don’t believe for one second he did. He picked up the phone said the manager said no and wished me a nice day and hung up the phone. What a bunch of unprofessional xxxxxx.  Go else where for your Jeep. Not this Chinese communist dealer wit the mandatory packages. ",1.0
1,"May 23, 2020","Melvin Jones was my salesman and he was quick and efficient in his response to my inquiry to my 2018 Dodge Ram.  I went looking for a pickup and he had what I was looking for and he was able to work with me and other customers.  Most salesmen can not handle this, but he did.  Next time I am in the market for a Dodge product I will be sure to contact Melvin for my next purchase and I will refer him to anyone I know that is in the market to purchase a Didge product.",5.0
2,"May 10, 2020","I went to the dealership today moved by the good deal I saw online. However, they wanted me to pay over $ 1,000 on add ons for a preowned vehicle . they will not removed or negotiate the price for those items.  Everybody knows that add ons don't add value to the vehicle. It is a very low/ bad practice, not to display that info and let customer know until the numbers  are run. $ 1,000 for add ons on a preowned vehicle , really. that's xxu my friends, morally low, worst of all it was a basic vehicle with no power wheels or tint or locks. F/ liers.

4,"April 23, 2020","Watch out for the fees!!   I made an online inquiry to confirm availability and set up appointment to come and purchase a jeep.   I asked about rebates and financing then asked what fees other than true TTL would i be surprised with by finance manager.   line went quiet...  then I was told of $2900 cost for wheel locks, nitrogen in tires, security tracker, and tinted windows.... all non negotiable.....   don't be fooled by their misleading online prices!!!",1.0
5,"March 05, 2020","I am a credit union looking to send them a check (once we get white slip) I have called repeatedly and got one call back.  They would check on it and never heard back.

I can not get management or accounting on phone, when I call I get sent to voice mail and never get call again.

6,"February 17, 2020","I visited their dealership today and found my experience utterly disappointing.
I had interacted with your internet team and had got a valid quote for a car and also booked an appointment.
Since this was going to be my wife's car, I brought her and my 2 kids (1 infant) for confirming the deal.
When I reached there, I was asked to work with your salesman Melvin Jones. I was made to wait for a very long time and could view the car only after 90 minutes of coming.

I would have been fine with the delay had you guys been honest about your prices. I was looking for a 2019 Jeep renegade and got a confirmed quote (email) of $14300.  This was the first thing I told Melvin and was very clear about my ask. After 2.5 hours, Melvin started talking to us about the price. To my surprise, the price was now $17,800 because there was a mandatory security package that I had to take. When I told him that this is bait and switch as you are quoting a different value online which does not specify anything about this package he went in and sent an individual who seemed to be a ""manager"" of sorts. He tried to explain me that this was the correct price and that it still beats others. Although, this is not correct (There are other dealers who have it cheaper), this is not the point. You can not show a price, confirm in an email, invite the customer and then add a package and make it mandatory. Also, i was told that the only option i had was to finance my car (as against my choice of buying it outright). Again, this was not referenced anywhere on the website or email confirmation.

This is completely unacceptable and should be taken up by your management. If you guys pride yourself as an honest and fair company, these practices should not be followed.
As i write this letter, I can still see the $14,300 car on your website. You are not only losing 1 customer, but I will ensure that i speak about my experience within our community to educate them about such practices.

7,"February 09, 2020","Visited the dealership on Feb. 8,2020, looked at and test drove a used 2018 Ford Edge (Stock # R1170A) , sat down with my sales person to go over the vehicle cost, my down payment, etc., the sales person took the information to the sales manager and returned with a printed cost sheet, I reviewed it and asked if the vehicle price was negotiable and the answer was no and that was ok due to the price being recently reduced(tires where worn out, damage to the left front bumper), also requested that the $995 gps device be removed and the answer was no, I thanked the sales person for his time and proceeded to leave the dealership and half way across the sales floor i was alerted by someone yelling my last name while conversing with my wife on the way out the door and so I turned around to have a conversation with this person and found him to be very angry, down right ugly towards myself and my wife and son, very unprofessional individual, he was looking for a confrontation with me over a used car sale, why ? that I chose to walk away from due to the sales manager informing the sales person to inform me that the gps device could not and would not be removed, beware public of the tall man with a beard and cowboy boots !!!!! Never again will I set foot in a Mac Haik Dealership, last but not least Christopher was a very professional sales person and I wish him luck with his job and career, and if the general manager or owner wants to speak with me about this matter Christopher has my phone number (he sent me a video of this vehicle before I came in.",1.0
8,"January 08, 2020","I wish I could leave a much better review of this place, they had the car my husband really wanted, so we drove 3 hours to Houston to purchase the car, the salesmen Alex, was great so this review does not reflect him. It is focused more on the inspections of the car, safety and the customer service provided by the management.
We bought our car on 11/26, drove it back home 3 hours, 10 days after buying the car, on my way home from work, it started making a concerning sound. After some searching, I realized the inner part of my front 2 tires were worn down so extremely the wires where sticking out. I took my car straight to a tire shop, as it was very unsafe for me to be driving. In short, new tires, part to fix the alignment properly and alignment cost me $1287.89, just 10days after purchasing.
After several attempts to reach the manager, Cezar Tronio, full voice mail, phone being hung up, messages to other employees saying they will have Cezar call me back, I was finally able to talk with him. He requested I send him receipts and pictures, and he would talk with the GM. I sent them promptly. After another week of not hearing from him, I text and emailed him. After some back and forth he said he could only pay for the 2 bad tires and he could not give me more than $500. This car is an all-wheel drive car, so it has to have all for tires changed, not to mention the tire shop pointed out that the car had 3 different types of tires to begin with. I did agree to them only paying for 2 tires, but I think it is only fair they pay for the alignment and the parts. I do not think it is right that, what I thought was a trusted dealership, would send someone out with unsafe tires. We could have been in a wreck, if one of them had blown. At this point they are only going to pay for the two tires and not the alignment and parts, which tells me they will knowingly sell a car and mask the problem with new tires and not fully fix the issue.
After some time of not hearing back again and it being almost a month my credit card payment was due for 1287.89. I was able to touch base with Cezar to send the $500, but informed him I was still very unsatisfied. I then attempted to reach the GM because this I feel this was very unprofessional and unsafe. After many attempts to reach Will LaGrange the GM, it has now been 1 month since I had to replace the tires and he has not reached out to me in any way.
BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE AND UNSAFE CAR! Could not be more unhappy at this point. 
Obviously if you are going to buy a car from here you need to have a mechanic check it over, because their mechanic can’t even do something as simple as checking tires (which I wish I had been more diligent about taking it elsewhere to be checked) and the manager and general manager is avoidant and does not seem to even care to right the situation after multiple attempts at reaching out to them.

10,"October 05, 2019",I found a jeep my wife wanted in Houston TX. Talk to salesman. got a price. Filled out credit stuff. Got a %%%%%% quote of 3.84%. this is Saturday night. I will FLY to TEXAS on tuesday.  Will let YOU know,3.5
11,"September 18, 2019","This dealership is extremely unethical and unorganized. I was lied to and I got my car back in pieces. The service drive told me a major part was broken when it was fine and the sales department ran my credit over a dozen times without telling me the price of the vehicle and lied to me for three hours and then blamed me. 

I had my car towed to the dealership after it overheated, meaning I could not drive it out of the dealership. I was told upon having a diagnostic performed that the thermostat had blown and that the radiator also had cracked due to the pressure in my engine. I was told service, parts, additional fluid, and an additional routine check would run me $2,000. I dropped the car off and was told there were no loaner vehicles and that I could go to Enterprise, which would've cost me around $450 for two days. I promptly refused and Ubered home. After speaking with a service manager at the dealership I was finally offered a loaner vehicle, so I could get to work. 

Then, after being told that I would know what was wrong with my car that same day, since I dropped the car off before 9am, I called after work and still did not know what was wrong with my car. When they finally told me that it was my thermostat and radiator, I asked them to worked out pricing and tell me what was absolutely necessary, they still came back saying that it would cost me around $1500. 

In the meantime I tried to work with the sales department to look at getting into a new vehicle, since mine is getting older and has higher miles. I was then again lied to by the salesperson, who tried to con me into purchasing a new vehicle that I didn't even want! After asking for the price of a vehicle multiple times, that he was trying to get me into and I didn't even want, but was trying to get an idea of the price range, he sent me home in that vehicle and proceeded to run my credit over a dozen times! He went over my set monthly payment amount by almost $200 and then when he said he could get it down took got $15 taken off. I never wanted the car he put me in, and because he gave me that one, I lost the loaner for my car. 

After the sales manager started to argue with me and not fix anything or admit that his salesman had been manipulative and the pure definition of a used car salesman, I had to have my car towed away from the service drive to finally be rid of the dealership. When I fixed the thermostat myself, I found there was NOTHING wrong with the radiator. This dealership tried to charge me to replace a part that was perfectly fine and for a replacement job that cost me $50 to buy and 10 minutes to install. This dealership is despicable and I have already told as many people as I can I will never EVER have anything to do with them again and I will tell everyone I can they should avoid it like the plague.

12,"April 18, 2019","Worst experience for car service I've ever had.  I brought it in a two year old Ram 1500 Limited with multiple issues and a broken back window.  I pre-approved the window repair without a quote.  They held the car for 2 days only fixed the recall item (hey there is some easy money from the manufacturer) and then called me to pick it up.  When I got there they had a quote for the window but had not fixed it and claimed they couldn't reproduce the other issues even though I could do it on the lot.  Pierce my service contact just apologized but offered to do nothing and blamed his technician who's full name he didn't know because ""Mike is new"".   At this point I'm out of time to get it fixed, have already turned in my rental car (which cost me ~$150) and I'm having to make arrangements to send it to an out of town shop to get it repaired in time.  Absolutely lazy and incompetent staff who don't take accountability.  I'd accuse them of dishonesty but I don't think they care enough or are competent enough to be dishonest.  As a side note, the out of town place that is fixing it is fixing it for less than 50% of the quote I received but that's really just insult to injury since I was willing to pay the inflated price due to my timeline constraints.",1.6
13,"February 12, 2019","I found a truck online and spoke with Internet Sales employee Nick. He assured there were ""no games"" and the listed price of the truck is what it would be offered for when i arrived at the store (no hidden non-qualifying rebates). I informed Nick I had a lengthy drive to the dealership, child care concerns, time off work, and wanted to be sure there were not any surprises which he assured. Upon arrival I was informed by sales employee Irving that Nick would not being helping with the sale. Irving informed the truck I was there to see sold the night before, but of course he wanted to show me other vehicles in the price range. I think it's safe to say the truck listed on the website was never there, but was just a scam to get another customer in the door. Very convenient Nick would not show his face when I arrived in the morning.",1.0
14,"October 22, 2018","1)	Ben Rosenthal, my sales rep, was always helpful and never pushy.  He listened to me politely and really got what I was looking for.  The truck he brought out for me to test drive during my second visit pretty much had me sold @ first sight.
2)	Steven Carrizales, the sales manager on duty who helped us get to a final price, struck me as a straightforward guy from the first.  Negotiations proved to be relatively friendly, and felt fair.
3)	Delivery and support after the sale were immaculate, so any possible buyer’s remorse I might have been feeling just plain dissipated. 
4)	The only real “salesy” moment came when I was in the finance office and the subject of an extended warranty came up.  I was too tired to make a good decision by then, so instead of continuing to push, they agreed to hold the paperwork until the next morning, so I could sleep on it (and I still got to drive off in my fully gassed up, gleaming new truck). 

Every day I drive this new Ram truck (previously I owned a solid, but not exciting Toyota Tundra), I fall in love with it a little more.  It is roomy, the interior and exterior have a very polished look and feel, the safety features are super cool (and already proving helpful), and the quality of the engineering on the 2019 model reinforces in my mind why this truck is winning Detroit motor show and customer loyalty awards.  

500 miles down the road, my initial evaluation is, “So far, so great!”

15,"June 19, 2018","I was a first time buyer planning on purchasing a used, “certified” Jeep. I was planning on trading in my vehicle worth $3000 via Kelley Blue Book. Firstly, they told me that they lost the key to the Jeep, so I was unable to even test drive the vehicle when I needed to. Secondly, when we began discussing finances, they offered me $500 for my vehicle trade in. They said their reasoning was that my vehicle was “unsellable”. After I said that wasn’t true and showed them the Kelley Blue Book price, they quickly came back and offered me $3000. Next, I expected a certified pre-owned vehicle to be in adequate condition, at least. But after taking the Jeep to a third party, non-biased mechanic for a pre-purchase inspection, the mechanic said he wouldn’t even charge me for the inspection because the car was in such bad shape. He said, “If you were my son, I’d tell him not to buy this vehicle, and stay away from this dealership.” Very true! The only warranty on this “certified” vehicle was a short 90 day dealer-issued warranty. No thank you!

They probably thought I was a clueless, young, first time buyer who’d be easily swayed into giving them more profit. I felt taken advantage of, and I will not be visiting any more Mac Haik dealerships.

16,"September 26, 2017","After spending the last two weeks searching for the car I wanted to buy I decided on the Jeep Wrangler Unlimited. I spoke to several different dealers that wouldn't give me a price over the phone and insisted that I come down to play the dog and pony show. 

I ended up finding a low mileage unlimited I called down and I spoke to Obie. Obie actually wheeled and dealed with me over the phone. He ended up getting his manager Cesar, on the phone. Cesar ended up giving me a pretty good deal and I decided to go come down to the dealership and see if we could close the deal.

To be fair, I didn't have the best credit score and they offered me a decent rate in the single digits. I had to go home to get them a paycheck stub and by the time I returned, Cesar informed me that he found a new bank that offered me 2% less on the interest rate.... Who does that? 

I can't say enough about Obie and Cesar's professionalism. They treated me like a person and it was a win win for both the dealer and myself.

I LOVE my Unlimited!!!!!!!!!!
