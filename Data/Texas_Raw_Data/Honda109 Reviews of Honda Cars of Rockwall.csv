1,"June 05, 2019","Car was supposed have me and my sister name on it 
2017 civic
Got behind on note 
Got a call from sales manager telling me to call Honda financial and not to tell them I had car 
But to tell them I'm just a financial help to my sister
 Whole deal was bad
Called Honda financial 
They told me they would have never did a deal like that
And why did they only put my sister loan since I'm the one that had the car and was paying for it

I will never recommend this company to anyone ",1.0
2,"May 10, 2019","Dont use them!  Find another dealership for your car purchase!

We have been in contact with them for a few days about the purchase of a used vehicle that we have been searching for.  For days, we have been in touch by email and phone and everything seemed good to go for us to fly in to test drive and purchase (we were flying in from Colorado).  After speaking with Jim and Matt all week, we booked a $400 flight to Texas late Thursday night after speaking with them one last time.  Friday afternoon, we were told that this vehicle was getting work done at a Jeep dealership.  This information was known to them all along, but they never bothered to tell us.  We are now out the $400 for the flight and now all we can do is our best that nobody else makes the mistake of doing business at this dealership.

Also, all week this vehicle was listed on multiples sites (including their own site) at the same price, but as soon as they knew were were coming in to take a look, the price mysteriously went up $1,000 Friday morning.  

Don't think that this dealership is different than any other used car dealership and do your best to stay away!  whatever we can do to help others not make a bad mistake.",1.0
3,"February 24, 2019",Ben Teaney is a liar!!! Do not trust him!! He tells you want you want to hear to get you in the dealership. Then he goes back on the deal that he says his manager agreeded to. I drive along way and he passes me off to another salesman. I talked to him 3 times that morning to be assured of the deal. Because it wasn't in writing he acts like I'M the one lying!!! Do not go to this dealership!!,1.0

6,"October 17, 2018","They are not genuine in sales and services. The account department does not know what they  are doing. They don't have qualifications. Poor explanation and the assistant accounts manager is very rude. She tell you one thing and later on denies. The services department is not qualified. I took my car for the first service, they messed up with alignment. I had to spend more to fix it somewhere else. Be careful buyers.",1.0

8,"July 20, 2018","I bought a 2010 Ford F-150 supercrew 4x4 back in April. Started off with a horrible car buying experience. Had been discussing things with a salesman over the phone and set up an appointment to come in and look at the vehicle, show my trade in, and go through the process. Salesman was not there when I arrived like promised. Had to start the process over with a whole new salesman. So had to go through all the run around on price again. Was told the truck was 20k at first even though the first salesman had already quoted me a price at 18.5k and I had showed the text so we could start the negotiations at that point. During this time a huge hail storm comes through Rockwall. We leave shortly after not coming to terms on price of the truck. I receive an email a week later about reduced prices on the whole car lot cause of the hail damage to most vehicles, including the truck I was looking at. Then I receive a call from the original salesman that the truck has been reduced and now they could get me down to my monthly payments I wanted to be at. I ask about the hail damage and yes it has some on the hood and roof so the truck had been discounted but also they would be fixing it even after the sale since damage happened before the sale on the lot. Went ahead and let them run the numbers and send my info to the bank for approval. Told them I would not be trading my car in so I would have no negative equity to roll over on the new truck so that way that my payment could be lower. So agreed to a price over the phone and told the truck was ready and that I just needed to come sign the papers and it was good. Also told that once again the hail damage would be fixed. Show up and salesman once again tells me you don’t have to put anything down and all is good. Then I go to finance office to sign paper work and I’m asked how I’d like the pay the $500 I was told I needed to put down. I just told them I didn’t want the truck then if that was the case cause I was told I had a deal in place and was ready to go. So then they worked it back out so I would put nothing down. So signing paperwork with just myself on the loan and once again assured the damage would be fixed and they would give me a call and set up an appt and give loaner car. Receive a call a few days later that now I need myself and wife on the loan so we need to come back and redo paperwork. So we do. Then a couple days later I’m told the paper was messed up and that dates were wrong so they send the salesman to my house to have us sign paperwork. So I set up an appt with the salesman to meet at my house to sign. Which he shows up before me and just has my wife sign my name to paperwork then leaves before I can get there. Then call him and I’m reassured he’d be calling me next week to set up an appt to bring the truck In and get my loaner car so the hail damage can be fixed. No call, no return call from the voicemail I left him. So I go to pick up my plates and talk to another salesman and he says he’s aware and that my name is on the list and they are bringing in 5 cars at a time to fix due to having to give out loaner cars and that they’d be getting in touch with me to have it fixed. Fast forward to today and I call after emails to the dealership with no reply or anything. A salesman calls me back that remembers talking to me and is trying to be some what helpful but is trying to tell me that the hail damage repair guys are not at the dealership anymore and that my time window basically is done and it can’t be fixed now. He did also say he would try to contact general manager to see if they could still take care of it or estimate it and pay for it to be fixed at another shop. Which it what I’d prefer after this treatment I’ve received so far. The salesman that sold me my car and finance guy no longer work there either. So basically I was lost in the cracks or whatever they want to call it and now they don’t want to hold up their end of the deal. I also purchased a warranty with my truck to which now I pray nothing does happen to it cause they will probably try to screw me over there too. I know buying a new vehicle is never easy but I wouldn’t not recommend you ever even step foot on this lot to even talk cars with anyone after my experience. I’ve bought a few cars from Rockwall ford and Rockwall dodge and I’d highly recommend just going there and dealing with a dealership with some integrity and that will live up to their words. ",1.4

10,"April 02, 2018","This review is more for their finance department rather than the sales or service.  I purchased a vehicle in 2015 and traded that for another one in 2017.  They were supposed to send my gap insurance refund back.  I sent them all the documentation that they needed (as they instructed), waiting for months and never got my check.  I had to call them several times, and spoke with one their finance rep named Nancy.  Initially she told everything is in order and I should get my check.  Waited for another 3 weeks and still no check.  Called them back , and Nancy answers the phone again, and this time she tells me she has not clue what's going on and I need to contact their accounting department.  Not to mention she was rude and kept talking over me and discrediting me over the phone.  I spoke with their fiance director John Martinez and explained to him that I just needed my money back, and he told me the same thing that they don't deal with that and I need to call the accounting.  I was like why didn't you say this thing they first time I ever called your department!!  I just thought they were not open about this and the department and its personnel did a poor job at handling the situation.  They are very efficient at getting their money from you but not so good at sending you the refund you need.  I will not purchase any more vehicle from them again.",1.0
11,"April 01, 2018",We had a great experience buying our new 2018 Honda Pilot. Jim Bywater did an excellent job showing us what we asked for. Kevin Bonds in finance also was easy to work with. Overall one of our best car buying experiences. ,5.0

22,"February 24, 2018","Horrible experience, the advertised price is not what you get.  They get you in and then add $600 of dealer add ones.
Then at closing the car was advertised as a Certified PreOwned, they said the price did not include the CPO, it was extra.  Salesman never said it was extra only told us the benefits.
YOU are why car salesmen/ dealerships get such bad reputations.  If you are going to charge more,  advertise it.  Horrible, wrong!",1.0
23,"February 24, 2018","I am extremely disappointed in this dealership!  I have dealt with many people and dealerships in my life and have never seen such rude and inconsiderate people!  I did a pre-purchase on a car on Thursday night. I wanted to take it to our mechanic to get it checked to be sure it was a good safe car since I have 3 children. The mechanic told us about 900 dollars worth of work that needed to be done on the car. We tried to call the pre-owned director Nabeel Alghussain on Friday and left 3 different messages in which the last person assured he would call at 10 today Saturday. He never called so my husband and I both called today several times and no one would put us through to him. In the meantime my husband spoke with someone named Ryan who said he was also a pre-owned director. He stated he could do whatever we needed Nabeel for. He told my husband he could sell it without fixing these issues and that he believed his guys over our independent mechanic anyway. Finally, Nabeel did call me back and stated I would have to wait until he had time to deal with it. The people who were at the dealership were more important. So my husband went us there so we could also be important in their eyes!  He asked for Nabeel when he got there and they sent out the original sales guy who just got us the keys to our trade in and switched cars back!!!!  Then my husband asked to speak to the manager John Fraiser who in my mind should have been involved long before now and he was nice and said that nothing should have been handled the way it was so I am glad that he at least admitted how this should not have happened!  However, beware if you are looking for a pre-owned car they have actually stated they would sell this broken car that needs work done to someone else with no problem!  That’s the kind of service you are getting!  They don’t care at all about the people only the deal!  Very, very, very disappointed!  I would never want anyone to be treated like we were and I would never want to be sold a car that I immediately needed to get fixed!  What a sad place!  I can’t imagine wanting a deal so bad I put people in danger with a car that needs to be fixed!  I would steer clear of this place!!!!",1.4
24,"February 24, 2018","I made my appointment online; however, WillHuerta called me and made sure I did not get lost by giving me directions to the dealership. Will helped me to acquire my new Honda Ridgeline. I enjoyed talking to Will. He was very helpful at all times.

31,"February 04, 2018","I contacted your dealership and ""met"" Tanner over the phone.
I shared my selection and my price point, a few must-have's.  Because of my need for cloth seating, I had to forego the navigation and moonroof; however, my basics were included on my selection.
Within a few minutes we had agreed on a mutually favorable car/price.

I came in to your showroom and met Tanner and Jim; both very helpful, professional, educational and made the experience efficient.
Jim went with me for the test drive and was very knowledgeable about all the features new to me (apple car play/etc tutorials).
The actual buy was two-part process; your team knew I had time constraints and worked to get me in/out and ease.
When I voiced any concern(s), both Jim and Tanner were able to share solutions
Because I was alone when I purchased the Pilot, your Honda dealership ""housed"" my car for 24hrs and upon return, my car was pulled around front for easy accessibility.
I brought a church friend with me to help drive back my car to Dallas.
I told your staff that my church prayer partners had been praying and they/Honda of Rockwall was certainly ""an answer to many prayers""!

I certainly feel it was like meeting friends who were wanting to help me get a car not car salespeople wanting to just make a sale.
Your team made a friend and they sold me a car!
They've assured if any problems or concerns to call or come back and they will make sure I'm happy.

I will be back.  I will tell my friends and family about this outstanding car experience with these two find gentlemen :)",5.0

74,"August 27, 2017",Terry at Honda Cars of Rockwall was one of the best sales associates I have ever met.  He made my purchase of my new Civic SI the easiest and quickest experience I have ever had.  The finance team worked hard to get me a fair APR on financing and even beat my bank by .30 pts. This is the 6th Honda I have purchased and 5 of them were at Rusty Wallis. After this experience I will never go back to them.  Sticking with Honda Cars of Rockwall.  Oh by the way the Service Department guys are fantastic. We have used them for our 2012 Pilot which we will be able to keep around for a long time with their knowledge and skills.,4.8

99,"October 17, 2016","BEWARE!! First, let me explain that we have used Honda Cars of Rockwall dealership's service department numerous times in the past 3 years, spending thousands of dollars on car repairs. So, decided to purchased a used car for our children from them. Before we picked up the car, we paid to have a new set of 4 - 60,000 mile tires installed on it, as clearly printed on our sales invoice. Promptly the car was driven out of state and delivered it to our kids for their use while attending college. We simply trusted that the dealership had given us the tires WE PAID for. Recently, I discovered that the tires they put on the car were the lowest quality 40,000 mile tires available, which have now been discontinued!! Our kids have driven only 20,000 miles criss crossing the country, and the tires are at a 2 and must be replaced before winter snows begin. I understand the warranty for the tire itself is an issue to take up with the manufacturer; HOWEVER, the fact that Honda Cars of Rockwall installed a lower quality tire than what we clearly asked for and paid for, this is my issue with the dealership!

 I spoke with 4 different employees at the dealership, over the course of 10 days,  trying to work out a fair resolution for them BETRAYING our trust and making us feel SCAMED!! They originally offered us $56 as appeasement. After further discussion and the managers getting involved with the case, they simply said the dealership was unwilling to do anything to rectify their deception and violation of our trust, the trust of their client!

So here is the REAL issue for all of you reading this review, you are obviously searching for a dealership that you can trust. A dealership that you believe will actually perform the entire service or sell you the exact product that you pay for. Because I am not a mechanic and can not verify such things for myself, I will no longer trust Honda Cars of Rockwall with any of our future car services or purchases. Additionally,  I freely share this experience with all of my friends, associates, family members and on any internet outlet available. My goal is simply to  warn everyone to BEWARE, and to find a dealership that will be loyal to their customers. ",1.4

104,"August 10, 2015","I bought a 2013 Nissan Sentra from this company a month ago. Car was clean and my wife needed a car that was reliable so I didn't want to get one older than 2 years. The price seemed fail at 12,800. I worked with the salesman negotiating the terms of the sale, they had ""dealership fees"" which was a grand total of $1,600. I figured it was new tires, oil, detail work, gas etc even though I thought it was the ""price of doing business"" for them, I agreed to pay it anyways against my better judgement. After paying for the extended warranty  we went to pick up the car to drive it home and they hadn't even put gas in it?! Frustrated at this point, I decided to chalk it up to a greedy car company (I know I know) and went on with it. My wife drove the car home (about an hour drive) and when she got the car home she complained that it was driving funny I took the car out to test her complaints one evening and found that a headlight was misaligned and the car did shake at ~60MPH and would drift to the right, the transmission seemed to slip gears too (not a mechanic). Alignment and a simple headlight fix right? Nothing to write home about as the company said that the car was inspected and they swore that nothing was wrong with the car. The sales person even said it went through their certification process and found nothing to be wrong. We took the car to the dealership, they said the alignment was fine and that all it needed was new tires, not being a mechanic I believed them as I do understand tires can be out of balance and cause the same symptoms. They also said they checked the transmission and found nothing wrong and we got the car back. The alignment issues appeared to be fixed so we thought that was the last of the problems. The following weekend my wife went to Longview (about a 2 hour drive) to visit a friend and when she got there the car was making a very loud knocking noise. Scared and with our 7 year old I told her to take the car up to the Nissan dealership to have it checked out as I did not want them to be stranded in the middle of nowhere without cell coverage. At the Nissan dealership they said that the transmission was the problem and that they would need to replace it, so they gave my wife a rental for the week until the repairs are completed. I called Honda Cars of Rockwall and spoke to both the Sales Manager and the Service Manager and asked them specifically how they could miss something like the transmission both during the initial inspection through their ""certification"" process and after we brought it in complaining of symptoms of the transmission. The Sales Manager then tells me how he use to work for the Nissan group that we dropped the car off with and begins to talk bad about them. How unprofessional can someone be? You sold the car, you should stand behind what you sell. Maybe I am old school but does ethics mean nothing anymore? A week after we dropped it off at the Nissan dealership we had to drive 4 hours to pick the car up (2 hours one way). On the way home, we noticed a rattling noise when we were near the house. We decided to take the car back to Nissan in Frisco and as I write this it has been there in Frisco for 3 days as they diagnose the problem. I talked to the sales manager Rob or Rod who said he would ""look into it"" and call me back, I am still waiting on that call. This company has proven to me that customer's are not important and have done nothing to try and resolve this issue. In the first month of owning a car from this dealership I have driven rental cars more than the car I haven't even made the first payment. Please do not think this is an isolated event, read the other negative reviews and STAY AWAY",1.0
105,"June 22, 2015","I went to Honda of Rockwall to see about trading my 2014 Honda Pilot as the payment just became more than we could afford.  When I initially emailed, a Sales person (I will call him Matt) emailed me back several times a day, called me several times a day telling me how he cold help me.  He kept telling me he needed to see my Pilot, so I had my Son and wife bring it to him.  He told them directly that he would email me.  From that point forward Matt never ever responded to another email or phone call that I made to him.  He probably found there was nothing he could do, but never even had the courtesy to call or at least email me to tell me he was wrong to lie to me about being able to help and that there was nothing he could do.  He chose to simply ignore me, I wasn't worth his time anymore.  It wasn't until I called my finance manager at Honda and told him about Matt that I finally received an email telling nothing could be done.
Sales people like Matt have should not be in this sales business at all.  He gives cars sales people the reputation they have.

John and Stephen are very honest and friendly salespersons. They gave me an upfront price which was one of the best two offers I got. I trusted them and I felt comfortable to work with them through the car buying process.  

It was difficulty for me to justify my choice of another dealership in stead of Rockwall. But I had to make the choice based on the very little difference in prices ,as I promised to both of the dealerships at the beginning, and the location of the dealerships. 

In addition to its upfront pricing, Rockwall has state of the art facility and first class service. Everyone there are very nice and they make you feel at home. I would recommend this dealership to everyone who asks me, and I will also consider this dealership for my next Honda car buy.",5.0

Because it was older (2007), it didn't come with a warranty.  Unfortunately, less than a week after we bought it, the transmission went caput.  Honda Cars COULD have said ""sorry about your bad luck.""  BUT, not only did they fix it at no cost to us, they gave us a loaner car to drive while we waited!  Now we have exactly the car we want with a completely rebuilt transmission.  Our experience couldn't have been any better.
