0,"December 04, 2019","I had left this review on two other sites. Both times the dealer reached out with  """"I would like the opportunity to address your concern, email me.""  I did! Never heard back from them. I believe those are just standard reply for public consumption. 

I took my car in for final check up before my warranty expired and asked for information on Extended Warranty. I never did get information on that, and when I went home that evening, smoke was coming through the console, and it smelled bad too. My child was in the vehicle with me. Luckily, it was a short drive. I had to return the vehicle and was told it appears when they worked on the car, the gasket seal was placed improperly causing leak. It happens. Still no information on extended Warranty. Few days ago, I called the service department, asking for information on the vehicle and the extended warranty. The lady took my information and said someone will call me back. That never happened. I thought BMW pride itself on excellent customer service and satisfaction. I'd expect poor service from other dealers but not BMW. ",2.0
1,"July 20, 2019",Bought a 2007 H3 online from these guys; they said everything was in working order but they sold me a car with an engine that needed to be re-built. The oil warning light came on after driving for an hour; oil pressure showed bad bearings. They knew this and sold it online quickly removing all info and also making me sign a bunch of legal paperwork. DO NOT TRUST THESE GUYS!!!,1.0

6,"September 26, 2017","Twice in the last 6 months I have had vehicles in for repair after each vehicle develop a coolant leak.  In both case (once in May and again in September) the day after repairs were ""completed"" the car's coolant system catasphorically failed and left a family member stranded!  Not a month later, not a week later, but the very next day!!!  What kind of repair service is this?  Do they not know how to properly repair a coolant system and pressure test it to make sure it won't fail?  I was given excuse after excuse why this was not their fault and it was just the quirky nature of German cars.  What kind of BS is that?  I am furious at the service I have received and their inability to repair this correctly, so my vehicles are safe for my family to drive.  Done with the entire BMW family of cars!  Never again will I buy a BMW.",1.0
7,"September 13, 2017","7 a.m. Appointment to put two new tires on car.  Showed up at 6:50.  First car to arrive.  Service advisor 15 minutes late for work.  Told me I needed an alignment.  Okay.  Heard nothing since.  It is now 10:15, no word no car.  Lots of employees walking around.  Another unhappy customer next to me says it's always like this here.  I see a big framed poster on the wall, signed by all service personnel, pledging high quality of service to customers.  ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!",1.0
8,"July 03, 2017","Don’t waste your time at this dealership. They will not stand behind their product! I bought a 2009 750LI at this dealership and it has turned out to be a total mess. Salesman was Josh R. It’s funny how when they are trying to sell you a car you get responses to emails and texts even on their day off. As soon as they get your money all communication ceases. This is the case here, no response to emails/texts, total silence. I was told and have in email that this car was a previous CPO and was covered under the BMW warranty. I was assured that all the kinks/bugs had been worked out as it was covered by the BMW warranty. I was also told more than once by two different salesmen that the dealership only keeps the cream of the crop and trade in’s that don’t pass inspection are sent to auction and end up on second hand lots.  

I specifically inquired about the valve stem seals as I had read about oil leaks on these cars. I bought the highest warranty (platinum) they offered for almost $5,000. I asked about valve seals to make sure it was covered by the warranty the dealership was selling me. I was assured they were covered and the warranty is good nationwide. 

 During the test drive I found out that the side cameras didn’t work, windshield was cracked, and oil change was due. I had all of these worked into the purchase to have repaired. I did not test the CD player and it still does not work to this day. The dealership refuses to repair it even though it hasn’t worked from day one. (I have plenty of documentation to support this) In hindsight I should have taken the car elsewhere for a pre-purchase inspection and these items would have more than likely been caught. I trusted the dealership and thought I was buying a quality used car.  

Picked up the car on 3/30/17 and the side cameras still did not work texted Josh, Got me in touch with Chip C. in service. Dropped the car off and they had it for two full days. Said they repaired it, picked it up and two days later, same malfunction. Take car back to dealer again and this time it’s three days. I am told they have to order new cameras. I am not sure why it wasn’t fixed right the first time but I was without a car for these five days. 

 On 4/5/17 I am driving home from Katy and I get a malfunction stating that the car is low on oil and to add a quart immediately. I text the salesman and he states that if I bring it by the dealership they will top it off for free. I don’t want free oil I want to know why a car with a fresh oil change is already low on oil. This also happens again on 4/27/17, 5/9/17, 6/9/17 and 6/29/17 at least a quart low each time. I have to stop what I am doing and go buy synthetic oil at $9.99 a bottle.   I take the car in on 5/1/17 and on 5/3/17 they diagnose an oil leak at the turbos, upper oil pan, lower oil pan, and valve guide seals. I am told that they will have to work with the warranty company and it will take two weeks. Still no answer on 6/12/17. I kept contacting Chip weekly and kept hearing “We are still working on it” come to find out the warranty company denied the claim because it is a pre-existing condition. I assume the warranty company knows that the seals didn’t fail in my first month of ownership.

   I took a trip encompassing 2,000 miles the week before and didn’t realize the front tires that were on the car when I bought it were bald and had tread showing. When I took the car in on 6/12/17 Chip said have you seen the front tires on your car? And I said they are the same ones that were on it when your dealership sold it to me. Pictures are below. The main question is why wasn’t this caught upon trade in before being put on the lot?  I then meet with Timothy Nguyen, the service manager, and I am told that the car needs $15,000 worth of work. Long story short I am told that my portion will be over $5,000. Keep in mind I haven’t had this car more than two months. I ask for a detailed estimate and he tells me he won’t have one for a couple of days. I wait two days and when I finally get a response (cut and pasted from email) this is what I get: Total Parts $7,502.87 Total Labor $ 6,265.00 Alignment $219.95 Sublet $1300 Tax $571.82  Two months later and I still haven’t received a detailed estimate of what needs to be done.   I ask why this wasn’t caught when inspected upon trade in and I was told it is a safety check and that is all. Naturally, I was not happy that they sold me a car that needed this much work. Timothy proceeds to tell me that I bought the car as-is and it’s my problem. I told him no, that I bought the extended warranty to cover items like this and specifically inquired about it with my salesman.   I am told over and over that the BMW spec is one quart of oil is to be burned every 750 miles. If this is the case all BMW’s on the road that don’t burn a quart of oil every 750 miles are out of spec. What is being done to bring those vehicles into spec and make them burn oil?   Timothy has the worst customer service skills I have encountered in a long time. He has an inability to return phone calls, answer phone calls, or respond to emails. I am not sure why he is in the position he is in but he is in the wrong field. This brings us to the rest of the crew.   In 50+ emails I have yet to get a response from Brian Smith (General sales manager) and David Richards (Pre-owned manager) they have been on every email and I guess they just sit on the sidelines and watch all of this. I didn’t receive a response from Randy Stine (General Manager) until June 19th. Although he was copied in on all of the emails from the beginning he chose to sit and watch all of the emails fly by and not get involved. In all fairness to Randy he was on vacation for 1.5 weeks out of the two plus months this has been going on. Chip (service advisor) and Josh (salesman) have been completely muted. If I am able to get a response out of Timothy, it is one sentence and at the most two. 

  I did have a meeting on June 22nd with Randy, Timothy, David, Fidel (shop foreman), and myself. I was pretty much told that it was my issue and that if they would have put any money into the car they would have had to price it out of a competitive price range. Pretty much same as before that I would still have to pay out of pocket if I wanted the car repaired.  
 I finally contacted Group1 which owns this dealership and got a hold of Linda. She was genuinely concerned and said for me to send all the emails and she would forward it on to someone there and hope for a resolution. I was contacted by Pat,he actually seemed concerned and listened to what I had to say. This was on Tuesday 6/27/17 and I heard back from him again on Friday 6/30/17. The options are: 
1. I pay $2,000 of the $16,000 to have car repaired.  
2. Sell the car back to them and walk -$2,000 of what I paid. 
3. Do nothing, get a lawyer, and fight them more.",1.0

11,"November 28, 2016","**Horrible Service Department**
**Don't waste time & frustration going here**
I took my 2015 435i Coupe in for tire alignment, squeaky Brakes & blown rear speaker November 11th 2016. At 38K miles with warranty and BMW Ultimate Protection Program up to 100K miles. Service advisor Chip Chappee handled the 7 am service call. When I arrived around 4:30 PM to pick up my car Chip informed me that BMW had issued an email notice to all service departments that merely cleaning rotors would be routine maintenance for 'squeaky Brakes '. Well brakes were still squeaking and speaker still rattling. So I had to take more time off from work to take it back in the next day since the problem was not corrected as promised the first visit. Manager Tim Nguyen had a lead mechanic go on a test run with me. The mechanic agreed speaker was definitely blown and after inspecting brakes that the discs were scarred and front pads were worn low. Went in to pick up my car the next day and STILL had squeaky Brakes and a Rattling speaker! I asked Chip to come ride with me as I was having him listen to my Rattling Speaker. At which time I was condescendingly told 'Maybe I shouldn't have the radio up so loud - It was slightly past HALF way (Harman Kardon Sound System). The Brakes have been cleaned and Pads Replaced, but from my front screen-Instrument Cluster( they reset just the rear pads ,so I am assuming the Front Pads were never done. When I asked - Really you're fine with me leaving with my car like this? Chip shrugged and sorry you are not satisfied!
This is my First BMW and I am currently driving around with Squeaky Brakes and a Speaker that rattles. Not The “Ultimate Driving Machine” BMW claims.
Hopefully there is a BMW Service Dept that takes pride in their work!!!!!!!!! Advantage Clear Lake BMW clearly does not.

He  called me to provide the car diagnostic on time and with a right  budget. His friendly attitude and kindly matters make you feel comfortable.

19,"March 04, 2016","Worst experience on getting a new car! I bought a 328 I BMW 2015 here last November. The seller was amazing and really helpful (Dustin). My car after two weeks of running started to smell weird (actually like cat's pee). I suddenly started to get allergies with no reasons. After a month of owning the car, I went to the car wash, and the personnel from the car wash found mold underneath the carpet on the passenger's side. I thought at the beginning that they might have washed it before sell it to me, and they left the carpet wet. Two weeks later the same smell, and allergies started to come back, but this time it was even worse! There was a lake on the passengers side after two days of continuously rain. Finally I scheduled an appointment at the BMW on Katy freeway. The car was sold to me with a leak on the windshield. They didn't want to fix my car, because they didn't replace the windshield of my car, so the warranty didn't cover that. So I had to take it to league city where I actually bought my car. The car was fixed the first time. They did a horrible job, grease on my carpet, car was dirty and bad quality on the job ( so terrible) . Heather! My advisor handled it really well, and took my car back, and they worked on it again. This time the car had grease on top of the roof, the windshield was super dirty with hand prints, and the car had two scratches on the drivers side. Heather told me that the car was not fixed properly the first time, because they put a mechanic that was getting trained there to fix it. Could you imagined that? These are not a pair of shoes that I took there to get fixed or repaired! Cmon! After this huge issue , I sent Heather an email about the problem , and how bad, and scared I felt to take my car back there, and they haven't answered anything to me about all these issues. This is so sad to see! They sold me a car with an issue, that cost me a lot of my time and effort to be fixed. After the fixed it, they scratched it. A whole
Combo (just full of bad consequences) . This is actually my worst experience on getting a new car. I actually feel scared to have to deal with this dealer again. So many negligent people that worked on my car! So sad!",2.2

21,"January 27, 2016",Just bought my 4th BMW. 2nd from this location. As long as I drive this brand I will continue to buy from Clear Lake BMW. I love my service adviser Jason Creacy. Being that he was a Master Tech before a service adviser allows me to have faith in him. Most Service people feel like salesmen. Which is not a good thing. He is always upfront with me and even when issues arise that are out of the norm he goes above and beyond to rectify the issue. I could sit and talk to him all day even if it drove him nuts. I wouldn't trust anyone else to be honest about what service I needed as well as don't. I wish BMW would train their Employees the way Jason does business. Top notch in my book. Some people can't accept that cars are made by people that are imperfect. Issues will arise and with people like Jason they make things go much smoother. I hope the higher ups notice that his worth is of great importance to the company.,5.0
22,"January 06, 2016",I will never use this dealership again. Make sure when you are discussing problems and resolutions get it in writing. This assures that you and your service rep are on the same page. First issue with my car was that the brand new key the square piece that I paid 190.00 for would not synchronize to the vehicle including alarm also. So come to find out its an antenna. 1800.00. Next the car is being worked on I get a call the key still won't sync so they have to order another part but no guarantee that it will work. An extra 900.00. Pick the car up. The car starts but the key is not synced to the alarm. I talked to chip he goes let me talk to the tech. Chip comes back only to tell me. The alarm is another problem and they can take a look at it. Well that's what I thought this whole ordeal was about getting the key synchronized to the car so that it would start and that I would have keyless entry. NOT!!!! NEVER AGAIN!!! Money taken partial service rendered!!!!!!!!!,1.6

30,"November 27, 2014","We brought in our 2011 BMW X-5 35d 11 days earlier with an error message that the vehicle would no longer start after 200 miles. Chip, the service adviser, as well as Zeke Gates, the service manager, both said they had never seen such an error, exhaust fluid incorrect.  We researched and then emailed the results twice to Chip, who was unable to open the attachment, so we actually drove there and gave them a hard copy. Long story short, 11 days later, and $1305,-- later we still have the identical error, only the car will no longer start in 30 miles. They had suggested we spend another $3200 to replace the NOX sensors, but there was no guarantee that that would fix the problem.

33,"January 08, 2014","I took my BMW Z4 to get it diagnosed because it was not starting. It took them 2 weeks to diagnose my car, they said my wiring harness had been chewed by rodents which cause the starter to fail and that both had to be replaced. I went thru my insurance because I don't have the extended warranty with BMW (totally worth having it) because their prices for service is the down payment of a house basically. I filed the claim thru my insurance and gave Advantage BMW of Clear Lake the GREEN light for them to start working on my car. I could have gone anywhere else that work on BMW's but opted for them because of their credibility, service, and strictness on their service maintenance on BMW vehicles. On the mean time I had a rental that my insurance provided me with for 1 month. After a month my rental car was due and had to be returned. My car was still in BMW's service/repair shop because ""the part had not been shipped from Germany yet"". BMW was kind to give me a Loaner vehicle while my car was still been fixed. 3 weeks later I get a call that my car was ready. I did not mind the wait time, since driving one of their newer models i335 was very nice. The day I went to get my car and return their vehicle I received the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER. 

1st. They had lost ""misplaced"" the check my insurance had send them. (As I was walking out, they found it and called me back in)
2nd. The check amount they had received from my insurance was $1,000.00 Dollars less then the amount charged by the Shop. They broke down the service they had performed to my car which include Wiring Harness Replacement, Starter Replacement, MPI Multi Point Inspection, Alignment and wheel repair. This wheel repair had not been informed to me that it was going to be performed and raised the bill $500.00. My deductible was only $500.00 but with the surprising wheel repair I had to pay $1,000.00. I told them my deductible should have been only $500.00 But they said that was something I had to talk to my insurance about. They took away the vehicle they had loan me because according to them my car was ready, so I either paid the full amount or walked home. I paid the $1,000.00 and my car was given to me.
3rd First thing I noticed when I saw my car, not even a complimentary car wash was given to me, it had a whole bunch of feathers on the soft top and very filthy, it looked like an abandoned vehicle.
4. As I got in my car and I turned it on, my dashboard looked like a Christmas Tree, A whole bunch of lights were on including Service Engine Soon light. I tried washing my windshield and I did not had Washing Fluid on my car, Which According to their MPI Multi Point Inspection It should have been added. I immediately made them aware of this, I told them about this and they said, it had to be reset for the light to go away. When they brought the car back out to me, the Service Engine Soon light was still on, and also a light telling me that one on my tail brake lights was gone. When my vehicle was given to them none of this issues existed. I told them about this again.
They gave me the loaner vehicle back so they can do a full inspection to my Z4 again and get it diagnosed, something they had done already 2 months ago. 
3 days later I fixed the whole deductible issue with my insurance and got my $500.00 back.
BMW said that the reason my Service Engine Soon light was on was because my O2 Sensors were out and my Transmission Gasket was broken and had a transmission oil leak, and they could not tell how much transmission oil was in my transmission because they had no way to measure it. 
By this time my credibility of their worked performed to my car was not in good terms any more. The complimentary oil change that was given to me by their service advisor was no evidence of it, usually in any place were they perform oil changes they stick a sticker to your windshield telling when your next oil change will be. This time I could not see that in my car, the previous oil change sticker was still in my windshield. I asked them about this and they said that the car would tell me when the next oil change would have to be performed which is 15,000 miles or 12 months. I got back in my filthy abandoned looking car (still no complimentary car wash) and turned it on and notice that my car said that my service was due -11,000 miles which meant there was no service performed to it. I went back in there an told them about this issue again..., and said that message is for maintenance to my car and I had not had one done to it. I replied but didn't you guys did an MPI Multi Point Inspection? Didn't you said you did do a Oil Change? They said oh.. they must of forgotten to reset then. As I walked to my car with my BMW ""Service Adviser"" I asked him, how can i know you actually did performed a oil change to my car? He said BECAUSE I TOLD YOU SO, I replied yes, but how can I believe you with all this that you guys are putting me thru? On the mean time a repair tech was resetting my dashboard of service due message in my car to 0 (cero) and at that point I was already upset, frustrated and not kind any more, and i asked are you telling that its your people then back there that they are so incompetent that they keep on forgetting to reset my vehicle info? The service advisor raised his voice at me telling me to take it easy on them and I replied to the advisor with my tone of voice raised, how can I calm down Troy???? When you guys keep on making mistakes, the reason i brought my car to you guys was because of your service and credibility and so far i have received the worst service ever. The advisor then replied DO NOT SCREAM AT ME, I said i'm not screaming at you, I'm raising my voice just like you did. Advisor then said I was nice enough to provide you with a loaner vehicle and you say this is the worst service? I then replied yes worst service ever!!! The tech was done I got back in my dirty filthy abandoned looking car and drove away, and still no washing fluid to clean my windshield. ",1.0

I was met by Mr. Cue Nadarajah, who sat myself and my mother down, provided us with refreshments, made sure we were comfortable and proceeded to provide me with several options.  He listened to my requirements, affordability limitations and put forth the best options available to me. I had not  purchased a new car in almost 10 years, and was very nervous about taking this step.  Mr. Cue, put mind at ease, explaining every step of the process and answering all my questions.  He let me test drive several models until I settled on a 2013 BMW 325i, certfied.  He continued to go back and forth between management the  finance department  and worked out the best deal possible for me. 

I worked at Verizon Wireless for 7 years as a customer service call center director.  One of my technical specializations was providing world class customer service to our customer base.   I consider the service provided to me at this dealership, beyond outstanding!!  Mr Cue and the entire staff was extremely knowledgeable, honest, and went out of there way to make sure I left a satisfied customer.  Mr. Cue even followed up with me over the course of the following week, to ensure that I was comfortable with my car and to addresss any additional questions that I may have had.  I cannot say enough about this amazing experience and I will never buy another car from anyone else again! I also cannot say enough about Mr. Cue.  His warm, approachable and honest manner, in addition to his immense knowledge base about BMWs,  made us feel at home and garnered our trust.  If you are buying a BMW, I would recommend you visit no other BMW dealership in Greater Houston area but Cleark Lake Advantage.  Please ask for Mr Cue, and I guarantee you will leave a very satifisfied customer.",5.0
36,"September 05, 2013","I must say that Dereck took really good care of me and my daughter.  I first talk to Dereck about a 07 BMW 328i that they had on their lot for sale, I informed him that I was approve with my credit union and what my budget was.   Dereck informed that he would check to see in the vehicle was still available and call me back, he called back in about 15min to tell me that the vehicle had sold. I then decided to take my business to another dealer and found the same car that was lower in price then the car that Dereck had on his lot.  I drove from Round Rock Texas (which is 2 1/2 hour drive) to get a 2007 BMW 328i from another dealer.  I received a call from that salesperson from the other dealer that this car was yesterday.  So here we are driving from Round Rock to Houston and both cars sold, not I was out of ideas.  I received an email from Dereck informing that they just received a 07 328i with even lower miles then the original one, he sent me picture and updated information on the process that they were taking the car thought. I was so impressed and grateful to Dereck for not just turning his back on us and hooking me up with my new family member.  ",5.0
37,"August 27, 2013","Aside from a major hiccup that was finally resolved this dealer is great. The price of the vehicle was great and even though the process wasn't as easy as I would have liked it to be, the issue was finally resolved. ",4.3
38,"July 07, 2013","Advantage BMW Clear Lake is consistently the best with customer satisfaction.  My service manager, Jason Creacy, goes above and beyond to make the appointment satisfying - from selecting a date that works for me with a comparable loaner vehicle, to providing the service in a timely manner.  Jason is knowledgeable, as he has worked in the service area prior to becoming an advisor.  I have the utmost appreciation for his role as my advisor and have, and will continue, to recommend this dealership to my friends.  Thank you Jason!",5.0
39,"June 20, 2013","Dereck made the buying process very plesant, straight forward and easy. No high pressure sales or other tactics. Dereck was very accessible and responsive during the process in terms of answering my questions and providing information. I would recommend Dereck and this dealership to a friend or family member and would do business here again in the future. ",5.0
40,"June 15, 2013","First, let me say I live outside of Dallas, however, I purchased here. 

From the initial contact, via email, Dereck was attentive and genuine. After chatting for a couple days, I decided to place my order with Dereck because I trusted him. Six weeks later I picked up my new BMW and everything went as smooth as The beginning. At end of the day, this is about a relationship, not just buying a car. I'm glad I found my new BMW salesman, Dereck. 

Great job to everyone!!!

42,"February 14, 2013","I love my new 750 and wwas very pleased with the entire process of purchasing it from Adavntage BMW with Captain Chris Castillo.  He is very knowledgable about the various products and features, explained everything to  us in a very thorough manner, and most importantly I felt I could trust him with regard to the final deal we negotiated.  Will definately be back to purchase from Chris again.",5.0
43,"February 13, 2013","My husband and I stopped in at Advantage BMW with the intent of ""just looking.""  We had planned to visit the different luxury car dealerships that day to determine what we wanted.  Chris approached us to inquire what we were looking for.  After discussing our wants and needs, we test drove a 740.  Needless to say, that was ""all she wrote.""  Chris was very thorough in explaining the vehicle features and was not at all pushy about a sale.  He made the process very easy.  Needless to say, we drove a vehicle home that night.  We truly love the vehicle and would highly recommend Chris and Advantage BMW Clear Lake.

45,"January 28, 2013","I came in to just take a look for at the cars that were there.  I wasn't planning on buying a car that day, but Chris asked me what I was looking for and pointed me in the direction I wanted.  It fit my budget and I was pleased with the prompt and friendly experience I had.  When I take my car in for service, I drop by to say hello.

46,"January 28, 2013","I do not guage dealers and sales people by the ramp up to buying a car.  If that part of the experience is negative, I leave.  I guage the experience in the follow up.  Advantage, and Chris Castillo in particular, has been excellent in all follow up matters/service issues that have arisen.  THe repair department has been superb in turn around time.  I have no reservations recommending this dealership.",4.6
47,"January 14, 2013","Captain Chris Castillo is the best salesman I have ever worked with. He is knowledgable beyond any BMW representative I have ever talked to and has a great history with selling this remarkable automobile. I first met Chris ten years ago when I bought my yacht from him. I walked in to the Clear Lake showroom last month and wanted to test drive a 7 series. Chris demonstrated the attributes of the BMW and I was suddenly a convert. I had purchased three Mercedes in previous years and quickly learned what I had been missing. 

Captain Chris treats his clients like his best friend and never misleads or overstates facts. So far, I have purchased two BMW's from Chris and my son has also purchased a BMW from Chris on my recommendation. I also tell everyone about my wonderful experiences dealing with Chris and I am already looking forward to my next purchase through Chris. (Grand daughter's car) 

Before retirement, I had operated my own retail business and was never fortunate enough to find an employee or salesman with the wonderful qualities that Chris has. He is without a doubt the premier salesman at Advantage BMW Clear Lake. ",5.0
48,"January 07, 2013","Had a horrible time when we bought our car from the salesman. He didnt go over the car with us, just handed us the keys and walked away. Had to wait 3 hrs to sign documents, just bad bad bad. He was rude and if it wasnt for the fact that we were tired we would have left. ",1.6
49,"August 15, 2012","I stopped at Advantage BMW in the driving rain to look at two Ford 250's.  As I was checking the prices, I was surprised to see Chris come to my assiatance.  As we were returning to his desk, he told me of another truck they had received the previous day.  We promptly returned to the back lot and he showed me the truck I now own.  
captain Chris had the vehicle made ready by the following afternoon, and after an extensive test drive,I knew that I wanted to deal with Advantage. The purchase was as smooth as silk.  I look foward to their service being as helpful as the sale!!  Thank you Captain Chris.",5.0
50,"July 20, 2012",Chris helped my husband so much when we decided this was the car we wanted. He jumped through hoops to get us locked in with the purchase and we truly appreciate all he did. We absolutely love the 2006 z4 we purchased. Thank you!!!!,5.0

52,"June 18, 2012","I am extremely picky when it comes to car purchases and this go round was no different. I walked into the dealership with clear expectations regarding the vehicle I wanted, features, price, and level of professionalism I expected to encounter during the process. Not only was I pleased, but the level of courtesy, straight-forwardness with regard to the details of the transaction, as well as use of my time spent while processing everything went extremely well, in fact it far exceeded my expectations. Chris truly did make this purchase as easy and painless as possible and always had the value of my time and desires with regard to the vehicle and price in mind. He truly did make it a pleasant experience and I sailed through the car buying experience with minimal turbulance. I would definately recommend Chris to anyone looking for a vehicle and look forward to enjoying my new vehicle as it truly is exactly what I wanted when I began searching for a new BMW. Thanks Chris for putting all the pieces together.",5.0
53,"May 22, 2012",Let me start out by saying Chris Castillo was amazing given how hard I am to please. I shopped four stores looking for a knowledgeable advisor and the best deal. This was my first Seven Series and wanted every option. If I spend 102k for a car I want 102k worth of service. Castillo not only gave me first class service but more importantly he shot me straight from the beginning. I love my new BMW and am looking forward to working with Capt Chris in the future on my next car deals. I had a hard deal to do due my trade. Chris not only made it happen but I felt he really had my best interest in mind. I hope the guys in service are as good as he is. ,5.0
54,"May 04, 2012","Chris Castillo is the most friendliest, courteous, and professional salesman I have ever met. Not pushy at all. He was very patient, as it was two months from our very first visit until our actual purchase date. Chris made us feel very comfortable and at ease in purchasing our BMW. We are confident that Chris's offer to assist us with anything (even after the papers were signed) is sincere and honest. We have purchased cars at Advantage BMW Clear Lake in the past, and were familiar with the level of service they provide, yet it was still a very big decision to purchase a new car. Although there were other cars on my ""want list"", I quickly dismissed them after test-driving the BMW, and reflecting on how anxiety-free my wife and I have been when driving BMW's (no worries about servicing them, no concerns with quality, and no reservations about the character of the salespeople that work there). I have so owned many cars in my life, and I feel what BMW offers (quality of vehicle and service) are beyond expectations. At this point in my life, I frankly would not drive anything else, and would not bother even going to any dealer besides Advantage BMW Clear Lake. All of the people there were friendly, but I would particularly recommend Mr. Chris Castillo as a person to see if considering purchasing a vehicle at Advantage BMW Clear Lake.",5.0
55,"April 18, 2012","I have a BMW still under factory warranty.  My blinker stopped working and I brought in for the service.  First they said it's still under warranty and later called be back and said there is some kind of chemical was sprayed on the BLINK module and the factory warranty is voided.  I brought a few spray cleanners from Walmart to clean up the car and this is how the FACTORY WARRANTY is voided?????  Very disappointing!!!

I called USA BMW at  1-800-831-1117  to file a complaint. ",2.2

I waited around for a few more days and naturally, i went to see if i could find the best deal. i searched in two other states, and all over houston, and i have to say, working with Drew was the best BMW experience ive had.

58,"June 26, 2011","I have never been to a dealer that does so much to make sure they have gone out of their way to keep me satisified. These guys actually have fun doing what they do, and treat you like a friend and not just like the flavor of the moment. Cue is an outstanding salesman and Randy is an outstanding manager. There is a reason this is my forth purchase from Advantage Clear lake.",5.0
59,"March 25, 2011","I would not recommend having any work done here. I brought my Z4 in for an oil change and to have the headlights repaired. The problem with the headlights was that they were pointing very low. After the oil change was finished, I was told that they forgot to check the lights but since I had to bring the car back for the replacement of a recalled part and additional maintenance, they would check them at that time. (Not a problem, sometimes things just happen) I brought the car in the second time and after the maintenance and replacement of recall part was done, I was told that the computer was reprogrammed and that would probably fix the problem. Once it turned dark, I realized that the reprogramming did not fix the headlights. The third time the car was brought in; I was told that the lights did not work because they were not on automatic. Put the headlights on automatic and when it got dark, lights were still pointing very low. The fourth time I brought the car in, I was told that a part was broken and needed to be replaced. Cost of repair: over $600.00. Had them do the work and picked up the car. Checked the lights in the dark and the lights are still pointing very low. It appears that they did not even check to see if the headlights were working correctly after each visit. My service rep was nice enough and seemed to want to get everything fixed but having to bring my car in 4 times for the same problem leads me to believe there are some serious issues with the technicians doing the work.

60,"November 22, 2010","Went to buy a preowned car. The manager Tom Matis (or Mitas) was so rude....in between negotiation process, he came upto my face and said ""The price was listed on the website, what were you thinking when you came here?"". I got so pissed that only after numerous apologies by the salesperson that I stayed there.

On top of that, they sold me a vehicle that had the warranty voided and had all aftermarket parts....Tom Mitas would not pick up my call anymore and wont wanna deal with it. They wont service it because the warranty does not apply but they did not tell me that before.

Never ever go to these guys...they try to sell you pieces of junk and are too rude on top of that.",1.6

They do, give me a loaner to run errands, then I get a call on my cell saying it's ready 2 hours later!  I've leased for almost 6 years now and have NEVER received anything less than the best service!  For this, I'll drive BMW's from BMW Advantage Clear Lake always.",5.0
63,"December 18, 2009","This is my second BMW that I have owned and there are several short fallings compared to other vehicles in its class.  The biggest and most import is the road noise.  When I first purchased this car the road noise was minimal, but after 15k miles the road noise became so bad that I could not conduct business calls while driving.  I travel quite a bit and rental mid-class cars road noise was much less than the BMW.  Second, is the options are overpriced.  I spent an additional 12K on options that many other luxury cars have standard.  
	
From a service perspective the free maintenance is not so free.  These cars sit low to the ground and if you knock your alignment out it will cost you 220 each time, and the dealership I used couldn't ever get it right.  I do not think the service department actually performs the service requested.  A lady in front of me had asked them to take the car for a drive to determine a problem she was experiencing at driving speed which the service department stated they did. She wrote down the mileage before she dropped it off and when she picked it up it was the exact same.  Basically they had lied about even taking the car for a test drive.

Additionally, from a technology perspective they are lacking and seem to be a couple years behind.  Overall I would NOT recommend purchasing a BMW and I would recommend checking with the other luxury auto makers first.  I have two years left on my lease and I have purchased another vehicle to use for my daily use and the BMW sits in the garage collecting dust.

68,"June 21, 2004","They don't seem to have their act together, each time I have gone in for service, it doesn't go smooth. On a very negative note, my engine overheated, due to all the coolant leaking out, and they do not want to cover it under the warranty. They really did not care about the circumstances of the incident, just that it is their policy not to cover repair of the engine, if it overheats. In order to maintain the warranty, you would have to immediately shut the engine off, as soon as any hint of engine overheating or check coolant message was displayed. I called after the check coolant warning was displayed, I was told by service to bring it in when I wanted (I made an appointment for the next morning), that afternoon the check coolant warning came on again, and as I exited the freeway, the car died. I was informed the next day, that their was engine damage and it was my fault for driving the car while it was too hot......I am still at a loss for this one, as there was no indication, other than the warning message, which their own service technician was not concerned about.......",2.5
