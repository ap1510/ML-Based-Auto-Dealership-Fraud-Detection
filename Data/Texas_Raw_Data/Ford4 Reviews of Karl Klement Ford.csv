1,"June 13, 2019","DO NOT BUY USED FROM THESE PEOPLE.  They do not check their vehicles out before selling them.  Before I left lot the AC wasn't working.  They fixed after I drove an hour back to get it fixed.  Then the check engine light was coming on when the vehicle set for a period of time.  I called my salesman.  He no longer works there.  Surprise surprise.  Tells me to talk to JOE in used cars.  Joe would takes days to call us back.  When he finally did he said yes, you just purchase bring it in we will take care of you.  We had to got out of town for 3 weeks.  When we got back we brought it in.  I had to take off work because they wouldn't give us a loaner.  We drive an hour there again and was told it was $411.50 to fix.  We told Scott in service Joe was taking care of it.  Two days later I am told no they aren't.  I called and talked to Joe again and he tells me he never said he would pay to fix it.  We were putting words in his mouth.  I have drove and hour each way twice already, taken off work for things that should have been taken care of before I purchased it.  Don't call me a liar, I know what you said and I do not appreciate it.  Your customer service is terrible and you know it.  I will not say anything good about these people.  Joe you  need to get another job that isn't customer service.",1.0
2,"December 07, 2018",All the lug nuts were stripped on my car making changing a flat almost impossible. Karl Klememt Ford was the only place to touch my tires since it was new and I paid extra for the tire warranty. I told them that my lug nuts were stripped and needed to be changed since they messed them up and the service tech said that they changed them. I went to the tire shop today to buy my first set of new tires and had to buy new lug nuts because the Ford dealership had put the stripped out ones back on my car. ,1.0
