9,"August 17, 2019","I needed to switch from driving a large SUV to driving a smaller one.  The Outlander was a perfect choice. I had planned to buy used, but ended up with a brand new choice. I travel to different schools daily.  The Outlander is perfect for that. Nisa was my salesperson and she was awesome in helping me find something within in my budget and the monthly payment I wanted. I highly recommend Don Herring Mistsubishi. ",5.0
10,"August 14, 2019",I want to say that Nisa Hearns went beyond her customer service she made sure to get me intoba new car she wheel and dealed for me. She was not going to let me leave that lot without being a satisfied customer. Additonally the whole staff was exceptional made this sale happen. Came out a happy owner of a new 2019 outlander sportage! If you looking for a new car and a hard working staff look no further! Also Ruben and Ben are Amazing as well!,5.0

17,"August 06, 2018","I went to trade my car in for a new Mitsubishi outlander. The saleslady Samantha J C gave me a good trade in value and I was able to get a new car at a payment I can afford. Awesome sales reps, service and the car has the best A/C for our Texas heat. Thank you all for your help and great service. Carmen L",5.0
18,"February 04, 2014","I recently took my car in to be serviced for the same problem I experience 1 year prior (the check engine light popped on and the car would not turn on, the second time the check engine light came on and the car would turn but not start).  Although my car was still within the mileage range for the warranty, I was told it would not be covered because there was something causing the part to go out.   I was told my car was put on the machine and the code given meant I needed a new computer chip.  I agreed to have this part replaced and Kevin and I agreed on a date for me to pick up my car.  I spoke to Kevin several times over the span of 2 weeks and was told my car was being test driven and everything was good (just waiting for me to pick up).  I picked up my car on a Saturday and everything seemed to be good.  However, within 1 hr of leaving the dealership, the Check Engine light came on.  I immediately contacted Kevin to advise him the light had came on and he instructed me to bring the car back, which I did.  The following Monday I received a call from Kevin advising the Check Engine light was not coming on because of the problem I originally brought my car in for, but a new problem that would not cost an additional $1300 (after I had just paid $1000 (+), less than an hour prior).  Needless to say he could not explain to me why this problem was not detected the first time my car was placed on the computer, the problem was not detected until after my car had been worked on, deemed to be repaired, paid for and driven off the lot. I am a very dissatisfied customer and will be reporting this to the BBB.",2.0

21,"July 30, 2010","I was a customer of Herring Mitsubishi from the day I bought my 2002 Diamante in January of 2003 until this past April (2010) when I bought a Nissan Maxima, and although I already knew how great Herring's service department is, it wasn't fully driven home until I had to start dealing with Nissan's. OMG the contrast is so extreme it's ridiculous. With Nissan (Don Davis), you can't get anyone on the phone to make an appointment (I was on hold for 10 minutes before I realized I was STILL holding and hung up).  When you make an appointment via their website you cannot get a confirmation. What I received instead was an email from some guy stating ""We have received your Internet purchase request for a 2010 Nissan Maxima."" WTH? FORTUNATELY, Herring Mitsubishi services ALL models, so unless I have warranty work which absolutely HAS to be done at a Nissan service department, you better believe I will be taking my Maxima to Kevin Rogers at Herring in Dallas. When I call Kevin directly, if he doesn't immediately answer the phone himself (which is rare for him not to answer), he always returns my calls promptly. I have no problem getting an appointment and then getting right in and right out, and they always wash my car before returning it to me repaired/maintained and clean and always accompanied by a smile. You cannot go wrong with Herring on SALES OR SERVICE. TOP-notch dealership all the way around. And every necessary detail pertaining to service is explained in full in advance. No surprises when you get your invoice. Seven years of excellent service is what I received from Herring Mitsubishi of Dallas. -T. Ross",5.0
