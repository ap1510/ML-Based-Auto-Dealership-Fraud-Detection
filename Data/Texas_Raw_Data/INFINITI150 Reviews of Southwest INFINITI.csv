7,"August 31, 2019","READ THIS BEFORE WALKING IN THERE!
BE CAREFUL WITH THIS PLACE! Everybody is dishonest & total scam!!! Decline all their offers such as service plans, maintenance, kahu and such DO NOT ADD thinking you can cancel later. It will take you couple of months to do so, such a headache! kahu is not MANDATORY, despite they say cannot be removed. DO NOT BELIEVE THESE PEOPLE!!! 
Don’t deal with Nico Noor, he is such a scam as well as finance department guy Felipe Rodregoes will give you crazy interest rate to get you sign in for their extra stuff $$$$. 
Even their general manager didn’t understand and agreed with cheating and scamming to increase the sales. From the salesman to all they way to the top all are SCAMS!!! DO NOT WALK TO THIS DEALERSHIP...",1.8
8,"July 26, 2019","1. Promised remote start to be installed after buying the car, came back at appointment time. Services said Sales did not make an appointment. Waited 1 and half hour, we were told they only received 1 remote key and come back later. 
2. Complaint emailed sent to Chad and James, no response. 
3. No calls, emails, from services or sales 
4. Called to check the parts, we were told the keys are ready.
5. Sent my wife for installation, they said technician did not come, the keys were inside his tool box. 
6. scheduled an appointment again, see how it goes. 
7. Called service director cause it's getting ridicules. Really nice guy and offered to have someone pick up my wife's car and get us a loaner car. 
8. Declined the offer, just want them to stick to appointment this time and provide a reason for ignoring a customer. This is very tiring. They sold you a car and that's it, it's worst than a resale dealership. Infiniti... 
 
Will update google and yelp on progress...  ",2.8

My service light which had not been on during my entire drive there, while I was there or ever before, mysteriously came on as soon as they got in the truck. And I needed $1,600 to rectify. Now I am unable to pass inspection because this light is on. And my registration expires this month. Left several messages for GM but no response. Received one text from Madelynne Kendall.

Being able to text your service rep is a fantastic tool to keep the customer informed of all things going on while the car is being serviced.

34,"January 17, 2019","This is one Fraud dealership. They showed me a different car(Brand new) online in a different city and when the car came it was completely different with a totally different VIN, they playwd it smart very smart. The car online had 17 miles and the car came to me had good number of miles (didnt realize till i got home) that it cannot be called brand new with lots of issues. Upon realizing all the issues when i came home called the salesperson - Eric, no answer, called the executive manager - Fred Gallucci, no response even though I called him a few times and left voicemail in regards to issues i m having. Finally got a call from Chad one of their managers and said he was gonna unwind the deal. As i mentioned they are frauds, he than calls me after a few days saying that my trade in has already been auctioned. of coarse they had to waste time and make an excuse and also he said that i m stuck with this new vehicle. This dealership is very fraud and plays with ur time. makes false promises and than play around you with their lies and ignorance. They played it real smart with me all the fraud they did with me with the paper work and their words. Please don't trust this dealership. I made a mistake going to Southwest Infiniti. 
It is my fault somewhere but the way they make u wait and wait and I just got tired and wanted my car. its one of their tactics to waste your time and finally give you something close to what u wanted but by the time u find the issues and problems they will keep ignoring u and call u so late that by that time u cannot even unwind the deal. 
They are not even scared of doing fraud with people.
Very unprofessional and bad business. Its a regret.",1.0

38,"March 21, 2018","Southwest Infiniti Finance Department operates with a ""slamming"" mentality and will place several unwanted, unsigned third-party options on your finance contract. They will insist that it's part of your sales price and there is nothing you can do about taking the items off. However, keep in mind, these are ""options"" and if it's part of your sales price, you shouldn't see an additional cost on the contract you are signing. If you confront them about their practices, their Director Mark Wedgeworth will respond with hostility.
I reached out to the third party (Data Dots) they fraudulently signed me up for, and a falsified document was on file at their office. I'll advise anyone to shop elsewhere, but if you have no other choice, be smart and review everything!

39,"July 14, 2017","The sales manager told me "" what is with in tolerance, I don't even know what that means "" he is an incompetent kid with an attitude.
I bought my car, great experience. 
Then the nightmare started they got me.

First they scratched my car all over detailing it.
   Buffed it out 3 times, still looks bad. I was told they can't buff it much more the paint is getting thin they don't know what else they can do.... O yeah and if you by a black car you are supposed to expect a bad paint job because it's black....

Second my steering is off, the sales manager told me it is with in tolerance and that's it..

Third my auto off feature where the car saves co2 at a stop does not work 98% of the time. 

I will trade this car in asap and never go back to southwest Infiniti again, I suggest you never go there to start with.",1.8

I have had the car 2 months and have already had to replace a tire and the battery. I have had Lexus's previously and never have I ever had so much trouble with a car right after purchasing it. I will be buying Lexus's again in my future as I am very disappointed in how the Infiniti was sold to me.,2.0
42,"December 19, 2016",Outstanding customer service. I couldn't be happier with the service and my new car. Mark was a great financing manager. Definitely recommend seeing him. Extremely helpful and very nice. Keara was a great help when I was searching for my car. ,5.0
43,"November 21, 2016"," My wife and I needed a full sized SUV for our growing family. After months of searching online, I located a Durango at this dealership that was within my budget. I secured financing through my bank (just in case) and purchased a plane ticket Friday morning. The plan was to fly in that Monday, and if everything checked out, hopefully I'd be driving it back to NOLA that day. Unfortunately things did not go as planned, at first. Upon landing I gave Nick a call at Southwest Infiniti, only to find out the Durango in question was sold hours after he left Saturday evening for the weekend. I was disappointed, and upset naturally thinking that I had spent money for nothing. Nick told me he had some good news however, he received a newer Dodge Durango over the weekend. I decided to check it out just in case. I'm glad I did.  Long story short, Nick worked with me, and got me into a newer Durango with more features than the original Durango I was coming to see for nearly 5k less than their original asking price, and within my budget. The best part is my wife is happy. Thanks again Nick. God Bless. ",5.0
44,"October 21, 2016","Just bought a 2016 Chevy Silverado. I was working with Layth Khalili. He told me the truck was in ""pre-stein"" condition. I flew from WA because I felt I was communicating with an honest and trust worthy sales man. When I arrived, it was pouring rain but Layth validated with assurance that there were no dents. After arriving home, I counted over 150 dents that are common from hail storms. I called Layth feeling he needed to make this right. He had the dignity to tell me he didn't notice one of these dents and felt it wasn't his problem. He got his commission and that's all he cared about. That is pretty unbelievable. I will not be back for future purchases and do not recommend Layth for any purchases. It has been a headache thinking I bought a 2016 with 150 dents.",1.6

I was treated with respect and given a fair offer with appropriate interest rates given my credit score at the time. I've now obtained my fourth vehicle from Southwest Infiniti and they continue to be a great place to purchase/lease a vehicle. I get all my scheduled services here. The waiting area is always clean and they provide an assortment of hot and cold beverages, and sometimes fresh baked cookies. The staff is always friendly, and if ever I had an issue, they were happy to help resolve it. I recommend this place without reservation.",5.0
47,"July 28, 2015",".

Went in to look at a preowned G37 I had my eye on. There was damage to the bumper to which the saleswoman told me that they would replace the bumper for me free of charge. As soon as they got me to sign the paperwork, however, all the lies and sleazy tactics started to come out. I asked her about replacing the bumper and she told me that they would repair and paint over it ""if possible."" I knew this meant that they were just going to do what they could and see if I went for it. First attempt at repair was unsatisfactory to me, so they painted it again and I can live with the way it came out. Beware their paint and body shop. If consists of a guy in an EZ-up out in the back of the lot painting cars outdoors. This is one of the worst things you can do for auto paint but they don't care.
The financing rep I worked with tried the biggest con of all. I bought a service plan for the car and then decided that I would deal with any emergencies out of my pocket so I decided to cancel the plan a few days later. He provided the form and I promptly sent it back to him. I followed up and he said that I would get my money back 4-6 weeks later. 8 weeks go by and I call and I cannot get anyone to pick up the phone, call me back, nothing. I called Infiniti national relations and they say that the form was never submitted. Another blatant lie. I'm working with Infiniti national now to get my money back.
I don't have a bad taste in my mouth about the car, or even the Infiniti brand. However if they will show this kind of behavior and disrespect to me, they WILL do it to you. Beware this dealer. They will promise the world and make you feel like you are in some kind of control and then do a complete 180 on you after they get your money so they will never get another dime from me or anyone I know. Do not learn about this place the hard way like I did.
Also, a lot of the 5-star reviews on this and other sites are just copy-pasted to pump up the reputation of the dealership. They also mention salespeople by name and call them the best salesman ever. Beware self-promotion on review sites.",1.4
48,"May 28, 2015","Go With ""O"" !!!  
""O"" Odell Dovai is simply the BEST guy ever!  He's not just a salesman, but when we bought from
him, we got the feeling, that everyone loves this guy, and honestly, my wife and I do too!
As we were walking around the dealership, everyone, and I mean EVERYONE that worked there, kept saying his catch phrase ""Go With O""  He was greeted with big smiles from other salesmen, his previous clients that were in service, the receptionist ladies, everyone!  This made us feel like we were blessed to get this guy as our salesman, and he lived more than up to that.  O made it so simple to buy our suv.
We came in all prepared to haggle and have to fight for a good deal, and he just killed us.  He was so honest, so straightforward about pricing and the quality of the QX we were buying, that my wife and I still feel like we got the very best deal in town, even if it's only because we bought from ""O!""  
My wife and I very highly recommend Odell Dovai and Southwest Infiniti.

54,"April 23, 2015","I brought my M56 in for routine service and was promptly greeted by a very courteous valet, Johnathan and escorted into the service office to speak with Bobby Messer. He was well informed and helpful in bringing me up to par with my maintenance schedule which makes it easy for me to trust Southwest Infiniti.  I usually visit the Infiniti dealer on the west side of Houston but I feel more comfortable dealing with Bobby Messer.  I am usually apprehensive to bring my vehicle to a dealer for light service due to the typical two hour wait  just to get an oil change, but the guys at Southwest Infiniti had my service completed, including a nice car wash, in about 50 mins.

The car fax listed the car as certified pre-owned but that was taken away one day later. - Never really explained why but said not a big deal because of the late original purchase date of the car. This would mean the extended warranty was not as valuable.  Of course this was another lie.  He lied about the date by more than a year.  Pitiful. Tony, his boss, was no better.  Just telling us what we want to hear. When we finally got to the head guy (over all sales) he was arrogant and defensive of his guys.

Well as rude as he was about the whole thing and making us feel like we were a huge pain in his xxx...our friends decided since they knew the history of the car, and it was a low miles well cared for vehicle...they would go that route. The deal was struck and shortly afterwards they were saying the car had issues and started backing out of the deal... The car was low miles and still had plenty of warranty. In fact when asked if the CPO process would cover brakes, tires, etc....we were assured it would...lies lies lies... The net is that everyone found them so sleazy to deal with that they have walked away from the whole thing. Rude, dishonest, and untrustworthy...what more would you need to know to avoid this place.

There was noticeable body damage to the vehicle that I wanted to purchase however, they were not willing to work with me on the price at all. He was even trying to tell me that I was ""getting a deal"" because I didn't have to pay for the repairs that were made to the vehicle beforehand and in order to get it ready to sell, which is ridiculous. They then said that they could give me $300 off of the total price (which is less than 1% of the vehicle price) wow what a discount. The salesman lied to me and played childish sales antics right in front of my face. He was very condescending and argued with me until I got to the point where I got up and walked out. I went to another dealership right down the road and purchased a vehicle the next day. I got a much better deal in every aspect and had a very enjoyable car buying experience (as it should be).

The moment I walked in, I was treated as if I'd bought a dozen vehicles from them. Bobby Messer is my Service Adviser ... takes a personal interest in every aspect of the transaction, be it an oil change or major repair. The Service Director, Mark Nikolaus, shows a similar concern for customer satisfaction ... and he's accessible! On my first visit (a walk-in), I had a couple of concerns about my new ride ... one of the clips for the cargo net was missing, and I couldn't get the passenger window to operate in the automatic mode. Bobby immediately took the vehicle back to service, where the clip was installed. It turned out that the window motor needed replacement, so he arranged for a loaner. My vehicle was returned to me in pristine condition, washed and vacuumed ... and you've got to see the service area itself (which they encourage). It's as clean and neat as my living room. Even routine service on high-end automobiles generally comes with a price tag to match ... not so at Southwest. The have an ongoing oil and filter change special ... $40 for 100% synthetic oil.

The trade in worth they gave me was average but fair and on the certified used cars they didnt budge very much but when you understand that the guaranty comes from infiniti and that they stay behind their products than you understand why the price is what it is.

83,"March 28, 2014","I've had two encounters with this service center, so I'll write about both. Please excuse my lengthy review.

For my first service appointment, I showed up and my service consultant was absent. Instead, I was greeted by some young professional who didn’t even bother to introduce himself. My 50,000 mile scheduled maintenance took more than 2 hours. I was visibly upset when I left the dealership, but I got discounted a WHOPPING $20. 

The same young professional actually called me while I was returning home and left a voice mail apologizing for the long delay and not installing a license plate bracket on the front bumper.

After listening to the voicemail, I was INFURIRATED what I heard. Had I been there long enough, someone would’ve ruined the aesthetics of my car by installing a license plate bracket that I did NOT even request. 

Someone called to do a phone survey, and I angrily informed her that I would never, ever consider returning to that service center, even though she offered a showroom detail for my trouble.

Unfortunately, I had no choice but to return for my second service appointment (West Houston Infiniti didn’t offer Yokohoma tires). I arrived at 11:00 AM for my appointment and introduced myself to Bobby. I was informed that the appointment would take approximately 1.5 hours. I left the service center at 1:45 PM. 

I had 2 rear tires replaced, an alignment performed, inspection performed, nitrogen pumped into tires, and my car washed. 

I also didn’t receive a receipt for services rendered, so I don’t even know what $684 truly paid for. I was told that I would receive it through the mail. 

Yet again I’ll have to answer the phone survey angrily.

He confirmed that he had the vehicles.  We show up and the sales guy starts trying to sell me a used version of the vehicle we were looking at.  I said we were not interested.  I asked if we could look at and test drive one of the 3 vehicles.  He says, let's just take the green one (we were looking at black or silver) because it is raining and the green one is close.  We get back and again we ask to see 1 of the 3 vehicles we wanted to look at.  Now he can't find the keys.

Ray Wright answered all my questions and sent the informaiton to my credit union as I requested.  When I left Liberty I called mr. Wright and he said not to worry they would wait if I got into traffic but I did get there at 6:30 and a very nice lady in finance handled my paper work in a very short time.  When I was leaving mr. Wright gave me $40.00 for my friend and I to get something to eat.  I will tell everybody at work and at the credit union this is a great place to buy a car.   ,5.0
126,"September 26, 2011",The whole experience was fantastic.  Ray was a true pleasure to work with and was up fron and transparent during the entire process.  I will recommend everyone I know to go see Ray Wright and entertain buying an Infiniti.,5.0
127,"September 23, 2011",On 09/21/11 I traded in my 2006 Infiniti FX35 for a 2008 Infiniti G35 at Southwest Infiniti.  I could not be happier with the service I received from my salesman Ray Wright.  He was very friendly and very helpful during the purchasing process.  I am also very happy with the great deal I was given as well.  Lower payments on a newer car and a much cheaper interest rate!  Who could complain about that????  Overall I am extremely satisfied with how I was treated as a customer...and I will be a repeat customer for sure....and how they were so gracious to help me receive the best deal they could get me.  I am definitely telling friends and family to go by there when they are in the market for a new or used Infiniti.    ,5.0
128,"September 23, 2011",Our experience with the dealership was very positive.  My wife and I were looking for a certified used Infiniti G-35 which we had seen online and since I did not have much experience dealing with car dealerships I was a bit apprehensive about going to one.  I was pleasantly surprised at the friendliness of the staff especially Kim Jessee who was the person we were directly dealing with. He had all the information and background on the car we were looking at and were very comfortable with his responses to our questions on the history of the car.  We test drove the car I had selected and then decided to buy it.  Even while dealing with the not so fun part of buying a car ( price negotiations) Kim made us feel at home and well entertained. An hour later we got felt we had gotten a fair deal on the car and we happily drove away in it.  ,4.8
129,"August 31, 2011",I am always pleased with the service that Hector Diaz and his team provide.  Hector is very attentive to the needs of my G35 and I feel comfortable leaving my car in his hands every time.  I know that when I get it back it's been given the utmost service available.  I would definately recommend Hector Diaz if you are looking for excellent customer/car service.,5.0
130,"June 30, 2011","I purchased my 2007 M35 in 2009.  It never fails, the car salesmen STILL remember my name to this date and go out of their way to speak when I bring my vehicle in for service! 

Hector Diaz professionalism and expertise is TOP NOTCH!  Hector has been my  advisor for the past three years and he treats me as if our interaction is the first time we met.  If you are tired of feeling like you are  'just a number' kick your advisor to the curb and ask for Hector! ",5.0
131,"June 10, 2011","Hector Diaz is very professional and attend to customers' needs with attention.

134,"May 26, 2011","I have been a customer of Southwest Infiniti for the past 3 and a half years. Originally, I had a G35 on a three year lease and then I traded it in for the G25. Love the service department, I have worked with Hector Diaz every 3750 miles and like the fact that he is very personal and respectful in his interactions with the customer. He also goes out of his way to make sure that all of your questions are answered. Vehicle is delivered on time.

136,"May 25, 2011",Hector is extremely friendly and a pleasure to work with.  I come in for a service and they are always quick to have my car serviced so I can get on with my day.  I have been working with Hector For over 2 years and I would recommend him to my friends and family for sure.,5.0
137,"May 24, 2011","I've been getting my car serviced here for many years and have noticed that the quality of work has gotten a bit shabby since I first started there.  There have been a couple of times that I noticed that some of my fluids weren't up to par and this is a service that is included with the oil change.  Being a women, I depend on having the dealership perform a thorough inspection of my vehicle so that my safety is insured.  The customer service is always excellent and Hector has always been friendly and very helpful.  Overall, I would recommend this dealership. ",4.2
138,"May 05, 2011","I had scheduled an appointment with Hector Diaz to get my 75,000 mile workup on my 07' G35 had a great experience with him.  He went above and beyond to take care of the issues that I had.  I would definitely recommend Hector Diaz if you need any work done on your Infiniti at Southwest Infiniti. ",5.0
139,"May 05, 2011",I always comeback to Sourhwest Infiniti for service because the excellent service that Hector Diaz has always given me. He makes an extra effort to explain everything. He is very professional and at the same time he makes you feel very confortable to deal with him. You feel a sense of honesty that you don't find very often in the auto service departments. Spanish is my first language and Hector makes the extra effort to communicate with me in Spanish. He is doing an excellent job. It is a great experience to have my car serviced at Southwest Infiniti and I will be coming back for as long as they have Hector there. ,5.0
140,"April 28, 2011","I recently took my FX35 in for scheduled maintenance.  As usual, Hector Diaz was my service adviser.  Hector got me in and out very quickly, including a loaner car for the day; kept me informed throughout the day as to the status of the maintenance work; and got me checked out as soon as I arrived to pick up my car.  This is typical of my experience with Hector and the dealership.",5.0
141,"April 26, 2011","My service advisor was Hector Diaz.  He was very helpful and patient in answering all of my questions.  I am very picky about my car and I left very pleased with the work.  I recommend Hector Diaz and hope to work with him in the future.

142,"April 20, 2011", Appointment scheduled promptly and at time of my choosing. Loaner vehicle was clean and ready upon my arrival. My vehicle was ready when promised and cleaned. Service on vehicle performed to specification. Hector Diaz was polite and professional. This Dealership provides great customer service.,4.8

Is fantastic he makes every visit simple and fast no waiting around I have owned two QX56 and had a good experience each time i purchased I recommend south west Infiniti .",5.0
144,"April 14, 2011","The service writer, Hector Diaz, was most professional and attentive and accomodating to all the requests I made.  He kept me informed by telephone of the progress of service and worked with me to make being without my G-35 as painless as possible, even offering me a ride home when he discovered that, unbeknownst to me, my driver's license had expired several months earlier and I was not eligible to obtain a loaner car.  I was not happy to find that it would cost over $600 to replace the motor for my windshield wipers, but I assume the costs are in line with other dealers.  Overall, Mr. Diaz was efficient and courteous, and I would have no problem recommending SW Infiniti for dealer-provided service.    ",4.8
145,"April 14, 2011",Hector has handled my needs probable a half dozed times and each time he is very friendly and courteous and gives me any communication about my car and/or the service that is needed. I hope good reviews don't get him promoted where he is no longer available to his customers.,5.0
146,"April 12, 2011","Great service and qualified advisors. Always a pleasant experience and solid workmanship. I bought my FX45 there in 2003, first as a lease and then a purchase. They have taken care of all my needs since then and have never disappointed, whether it be routine maintenance or a warrantied repair situation. In fact, they just replaced the entire dashboard which was cracking, after 8 years and did not charge me a dime for it. I was very impressed that the company can and does stand behind its products so well and for so long. They have definitely bought my loyalty with this gesture and many others over time. I would strongly consider purchasing another Infiniti when the time comes and if I did, I would certainly purchase from this dealership.",4.6
147,"April 06, 2011",Everyone was very friendly.  I was greeted the moment I drove up both to drop off my car and to return the loaner car.  All the work was completed to my satisfaction and in a timely manner.  I was kept informed while being serviced and the service person went through all the work with me thoroughly afterward.,4.6
148,"July 25, 2010","I've recently purchase a 2011 qx56 from Southwest Infiniti. This was my 6th luxury car, the experience was beyond my expectations. The sales person Martin was amazing, from his low key approach to product knowledge on Infiniti and the competition. The business manager wasn't pushy trying to sell me on products. Momentum BMW and Sterling McCall Lexus should take a training course on customer service and knowelegeble personal. And in word about my new car, Amazing! By far the best Suv! What an experience.",5.0
149,"September 02, 2008",my lonner was given to a walk in customer i had an appoinment. this is the second time that happend to me i will never go to southwest infiniti and i will tell all my friends about the service. The reason that i was so upset is because he did not apologize for not having a loaner for me. I think that he sould have call me to let me know that he gave my loaner away. ,2.0
