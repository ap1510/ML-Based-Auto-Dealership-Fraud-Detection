1,"September 22, 2016","I recently bought a new F-150 from Bud Cross Ford. The whole sales process was unlike my previous experiences... in a good way. Its a ""at home"" feeling, friendly people, and there is no pressure,  I also brought it in for my first oil change (which was free) and the service advisor knew me by name. It made me feel special. I definitely recommend this place!",5.0
2,"July 26, 2016",The service department at Bud Cross Ford does nothing for you. I took a recall to them and the Service Department has done nothing in two weeks. ,1.0
