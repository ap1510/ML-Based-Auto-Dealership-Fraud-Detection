17,"June 22, 2019","Red McCombs, the absolute King of tax return financing, get your car they get your return, then a week later they send a wrecker in the middle of the night to repo your car, their lousy xxx excuse, the tax return down payment wasn’t enough bring in another thousand dollars and we’ll give your car back. Biggest hucksters thieves and liars on the planet, next to the US Congress, do NOT buy from ANY Red McCombs dealerships.",1.0

19,"May 26, 2019","Just recently bought a car this week and Jason Moran was so awesome!  I went to several dealerships and came back to Red McCombs honestly because of him.  He was the only salesman I met with that I felt was honest and personable, and that went a long way with me.  He was also the only salesman to tell me about the car I was interested in purchasing (and I think he literally told me everything there was to know).  After purchasing, he even helped me set up everything with all the different apps on my phone.  I am so thankful for Jason and 10/10 would recommend him to anyone looking to purchase a Toyota.  ",5.0
20,"April 17, 2019","Approximately 15 months ago I purchased my son's Toyota Yaris as a certified Pre-Owned vehicle from Alec Hardy at Red McCombs Toyota. I was very impressed and pleased with the entire experience. I have held on to Alec's card this entire time so knew I would consider Red McCombs Toyota again solely because of Alec. While I was merely trying to do my research, I didn't want to burden Alec until my mind was made up. I was perusing the site and clicked the fluorescent green ""Get McCombs Price"" on the vehicles I was considering to see what the bottom line price was. Lo and behold, Alec Hardy responded! He had thanked me for my previous purchase and for coming back and was up front about the costs and offering any additional assistance. A health issue arose for my husband that put my purchasing on hold for a week. In that time Alec followed up with several voicemails and emails. Don't get me wrong, not a single one of them was pushy in anyway. He was merely seeing if there was anything else he could do to assist in my purchasing. It was not intrusive at all. I never answer calls on my phone from numbers I don't know so all of his calls went to voicemail, but were always kind, considerate, and just checking in. After now owning a Toyota Corolla, 2 Highlanders, the aforementioned Yaris, and a Tundra, I was considering trading my Highlander in for the Rav4. At the last moment when I decided I may need a back-up plan of another Highlander, I found the one I wanted and shot a quick online inquiry about the bottom line price with manufacturer's rebates, Toyota customer loyalty, military discounts, etc. etc. As soon as the dealership opened I had a response from Alec. I mention this because Alec would be the reason I would recommend Red McCombs Toyota. I will admit I did not purchase from them because their prices couldn't compete with North Park Toyota, or their stock, but some people simply aren't going to drive clear across town (they are in complete opposite sides of San Antonio) so if you are considering Red McCombs please, please consider Alec Hardy. He works hard and offers top notch service. He's exceptionally customer-oriented. ",4.6
21,"April 09, 2019","Mark Bear was as helpful of a salesman that I have ever experienced.  He knew the products, answered questions, was extremely honest,  and helped me actually pick the right vehicle for my specific needs.  I told him I had limited time to get all paperwork done, and he made it all happen in my schedule.  I would definitely give him the opportunity to sell a vehicle to me again.",5.0
22,"February 04, 2019","Worst customer service ever. It's been over 2 months since we purchased a vehicle there and we have not received our license plates and registration. Receptionist handles all calls related to plates and is clueless as to why they're not in yet. It's not her job to handle this. We couldn't even get another temp plate issued. When I asked why, they couldn't give me an answer. When I called to talk to someone in the licensing office I just got voicemail. And when I requested to talk to the General Sales Manager I just got routed to his assistant who handles his calls and got her voicemail. Who's in charge here and why couldn't I get a satisfactory explanation as to why the plates are taking so long? I could have walked down to the licensing office and got them faster. A customer if first and foremost until they buy the vehicle and then forgotten about and is no longer important. I give this dealership a poor rating for customer service. It's all about the $$ and not about the customer. Thanks, but no thanks. We won't be doing business again. I'm sure they don't give a xxxx, but I'll be sure to spread the word about how we were handled at Red McCombs Toyota.",1.0

27,"March 26, 2018","Great Sales Experience, however their finance representative committed fraud (during the recorded session), fortunately I was able to catch it, and get my paperwork fixed otherwise I would have ended up spending almost $5k more then I agreed to. Finance director did a great job in helping me correct paperwork. Mr. George apologized to me for what happened , it was on tape, but the person who attempted to defraud me, so he could make commission, is still employed in finance with no reprocussions! Watch out!!!!",2.6

I highly recommend getting in contact with him to make your car purchase experience is fun and memorable. ",5.0
34,"April 04, 2017",Jacob Y. is the most amazing sales person I have ever encountered!!!

36,"March 04, 2017","This was one of the best experiences I have had with a car dealership. From the parking lot to the front door, I felt welcomed. The site was clean and the employee-customer relationship I experienced was OUTSTANDING. I would like to say that my sales rep, Sunny, made this experience worth my time. He was non-stop with helping me find the right vehicle, and was extremely patient. I know this post may get lost somewhere down the stream of reviews, but if someone happens to read it, Sunny is someone worth requesting to serve you. Also, if you are able to speak to a finance manager named Isaac Bolch, you are definitely on the right path. He was also non-stop in helping me lower my payments on my Tundra. Over all, I felt like there was a team of people fighting for me. I would love to go back in the future.",5.0
37,"February 25, 2017","San Antonio's biggest Toyota dealership is this city's biggest disappointment. I'm appalled by the magnitude of unprofessional behavior I have been subjected to at Red McComb's during my new car search these past weeks. After leaving an explicit description of exactly the car I was looking for through their online contact portal, I was emailed by Sunny Pakala, a snide smartypants salesman who was offensively aggressive in his sales tactics. Numerous times he made assertions that he later denied, despite email proof of his very words. When confronted with the truth, he ignored it. He also repeatedly pretended he ""didn't understand"" plain language but never even attempted to specify what needed clarification. In the process, he attempted to make you feel dumb for not speaking his suave sales dialect. At any rate, he ultimately made what seemed like a great offer on the car model I was looking for: a new, 2017 Camry LE. This had been discussed ad nauseam, thus there could have been no confusion about NEW car. Yet, upon reaching the dealership to finalize the deal, I encountered the vexing fact that this vehicle he was trying to sell had 3000 miles already. I felt deceived. Yet, Kenny Reyes, sales manager, arrogantly insisted this was a ""new"" car (simply because it hadn't been titled). He repeatedly called the deal on the table ""ridiculous"" and not once apologized for this glaring lie--rather accentuating the lie by pushing this technicality. Despite his haughty, snobby arrogance toward my wife and I, we tolerated his impetuous attitude and tried to continue negotiations on this car and other options. However, he grew increasingly insulting like a schoolyard bully so we had not choice but to leave. Lies, arrogance, insolence, unapologetic chicanery. Avoid at all costs.",1.0

him to any future customers at Red McCombs. He goes above and beyond,

This makes two Tacomas in a row for me from Red. If I buy another one it'll probably come from the same place.

71,"May 10, 2015","Took my wifes 2014 4 Runner here for the 10K Toyota Care service. I selected this dealership for this service after Cavender took almost 3 hrs. to do a tire rotation during the 5K Toyota Care service.  
McCombs knocked out an oil/filter change and tire rotation in 40 mins. 
Decided to check their work when I got home. Been working on cars for about 45 yrs.
Tire pressure was correct when I took it in. After this 10K service the pressure in all 4 tires was grossly uneven.
2 or more lugs on each wheel were loose. Had to torque lugs correctly.
Oil filter housing on this car is made of plastic. It was WAY over torqued. Had to loosen.
Told my wife that I would be doing all maint. on her car in the future as I always have.
McCombs apparently hires the same talent Jiffy Lube does.
And a message to the person who posts replies after many of these negative reviews.

After being sick of looking a high-mileage xxx cars, I started looking at some real dealerships.  Alec Hardy contacted me immediately, and we set up an appointment to meet over the weekend.

I didn't have a whole lot of money, but that didn't stop them from putting me into a beautiful Camry.  I pretty much fell in love with the car when I saw it.  We took it out for a test drive (raining at the time) and it handled great.  

When all was said and done, we got with the finance guy, Valente, and got me on my way.  There was a little snafu with the dates on some of the paperwork a few days later, but when I went to re-sign some stuff, they went ahead and filled my gas tank as an apology.

76,"November 15, 2014","Shane Mitchell was our salesman, Rudy Lizaola and Mirt Ramey were are Finance specialist. They went beyond what most dealerships would do and were able to work with our bank to get exactly what we wanted. A 2013 Highlander with low miles and extra clean for a used SUV.  Several of my co-workers have purchased vehicles from Shane and have had the same overall experience.

We went to several other dealers before Red McCombs and were not able to even get anywhere. One dealer wanted a lot of cash down on a high miles 2010. The other wanted 5K in cash down and then when we came in the next day with 5K they changed the numbers and tried to steer us to a high mileage Mercedes? Terrible experience!!!

I strongly recommend the team I worked with at Red McCombs and anticipate their service department will continue this excellent experience.

I believe a ""Deal""is when all parties walk away happy. We got a ""Deal"" at Red McCombs. ",5.0
77,"October 04, 2014","I have never bought a car for myself as my dad has always done it for me. I have heard about how salesman would do anything to get you to buy a car. and you end up with a huge payment and something you do not like. So I was really hesitant to go car shopping as the car salesmen are know as VULTURES to me.. Rick was oh my gosh so,so nice to me. He carefully listened to me and we talked and texted for 3 weeks before we even got together face to face. And he allowed me to make the choice and then he explained what was a good idea or not. and he was not pushy at all.. I felt so at eased like I was getting a massage...lol.. Then he took me to Frank and explained to me what he was going to do and stayed by me the whole time... for a single woman that really, really made me feel good.",5.0
78,"June 11, 2014","My wife and I decided that we need a mini-van as our family increased with the new editions of a little girl and a little boy in the last two years; in addition to our six year old. In total we are a young family of five. Currently, we share one car.

We decided to give Red McCombs a shot off of I-10. Our Salesperson was Travis, the Sales manager was Shaun, and the Finance rep. was Valente.

Thursday of last week, Travis showed us some vans that we were interested in and we eventually sat down with Shaun to pull some paperwork. My wife and my credit is not the best but we were coming in with a trade in that is paid for or possibly with some money down in addition.

Travis and Shaun told us one thing but the finance guy, Valente, told us something completely different.

I am a Sales manager and work with finance options for my clients. When I put pen to paper, the loan ended up with almost $ 7,000.00 unaccounted for!!! I'm sure these could be hidden fees, charges and commissions - OR - the finance guy (Valente) didn't figure the numbers right.

The thing about it is, we didn't ""beat-up"" anyone on price. We didn't ask for anything crazy. We just asked for a payment less than $ 400. on a used van (2010 Sienna LE with 96,000 + miles on it) where the asking price was 18999.99.

By the time I sat down with Valente, Monday afternoon, he recognized that we wanted to stay under 400.00 dollars a month for a payment but he proceeded to show me a term of 66 months with a payment of almost 500.00 a month!!!! When I put pen to paper and calculated Tax, Title, Interest, Principle, with the term offered, there was almost $ 7,000.00 unaccounted for build-in somewhere, or, the numbers were incorrect altogether.

I took time off from work to try and make a deal with these guys and Red McCombs used car dept off of I-10.. I even had to bring my family into the dealership, which is difficult with two little babies. I waited for over 40 minutes in the lobby before Valente asked for additional documents that he needed copies of (why did I wait over 40 minutes when all Valente needed was some copies, which I had brought in with me?). 

When I explained to Valente that we had time factors because of my work and the kids - he got short and irritated with me!  I then explained that I had been waiting for almost a hour as our appointment was arranged with Travis and Shaun at 10am. He changed his attitude a little but was still very un-empathetic to mine and my family's situation. 

We decided to leave and go to lunch. I had to call my work and explain that the arranged time off to make a deal on a van might not be enough time. We were basically waiting for the departments at this place to communicate and all get on the same page, only to go back after lunch (with all the kids again) and get over charged and almost ripped off on a crazy loan deal... 

At one point, Valente even turned the computer monitor around and showed me figures which showed the price worked in the deal was a thousand dollars more than the MSRP for the used van, a credit amount of over 1200.00 actually showed. 

The interest rate was at 18.99 %. You do the math, 7,000.00 added in somewhere.

I went out to the lobby and told my wife what was happening and she decided that we just needed to leave. So as we were leaving Valente tried to say that ""he didn't know"" we needed to be under 400.00 a month in payment, which is just infuriating. The double talk wasn't eloquent and was a joke. If you are gonna lie and double talk at least sound good when doing it. Reminded me of a con artist or a street panhandler when you catch them in a lie or call their bluff.

Travis didn't say much through all this. I don't think he knew quite what was going on himself. Shaun rushed out to the parking lot to shake my hand only to tell me to consider a co-signer for the loan.. so on some level he was lost as to what was going on.

Shortly after we left, Shaun/Travis called with a van that they would be willing to work payment of 400.00 dollars a month, which is all we wanted to begin with. Its crazy.

We are a young family who feel incredibly cheated, used, disrespected, and almost taken advantage of. I'm completely lost how a group of people can do this in any industry. The ethics and care for the customer became completely devoid.

The time and money and inconvenience placed on my family was astonishing - and still no van.

I will forever tell everyone of my experience and to NEVER work with these people at Red McCombs.",1.8

82,"April 24, 2014","The internet team sales person gave me a good quote for new Toyota Camry. I went there and test drove the car. I wanted a different color and he earlier had told it was fine with him. After running credit application, this guy says the car price is hiked $5.8K because I wanted a different color. If I asked him about the car that he quoted earlier, he said I could take it for the quoted price and he was ready to drive me to the lot to take the car for me. However when I asked the VIN number and miles driven in that car that I wanted to buy and asked if there were any problems in the car to be sold for huge difference in price for  $5.8K, he suddenly says some guy out of town had bought the car online. I am not surprised by this con. I think that's what sales has become nowadays. You lure a customer to dealership, run his credit and then raise the car price and interest rates. I wonder who would do something like this. He also said he is sorry for misleading me as if it really mattered to him. How do these guys sleep in the night?",1.2
83,"March 13, 2014"," The other day I went to purchase a car, not that I need one, but I do travel to Austin everyday. I had a set price for the car that I wanted.  He kept getting the car lower and lower, but not low enough for me.  He kept telling me to sign something saying that I would purchase the car at a different rate than what I was willing to pay.  Then he tells ME that I am playing games.  The price was lowered over 2,000, but not as low as I wanted for an older 2009 camry.  THEN he tells me it will cost another 1,000 do go get a different car from Universal.  The funny thing is Universal Toyota said lets go get the car and They will get me the price I want.  They even said they would go to San Marcos and get me a car.  In other words Isaac is a liar!! and I now refuse to give my money to Red Mccombs after I have had several people buy from them and me since 1998, My money will now be going elsewhere.  They are a bunch of crooks and liars!! BEWARE of them,  ",1.8
84,"December 07, 2013","After doing a lot of research online regarding the new 2014 scion Fr-s, I decided that was the car I definitely wanted. I searched all over the internet until I came across a website that gave an estimate of what the car should be worth and it provided me with a “certificate that locked in my savings”, meaning that the price stated on truecar.com was the price I was going to pay for the white Fr-s they supposedly had in stock. I printed out the “certificate” (which was about 4 pages long) like I was instructed to do but somehow the estimate given was for a 2013 fr-s, and not the 2014 Fr-s. I went back and checked the estimate for the 2014 Fr-s and it was only a $3.00 difference between the two, so I decided to just note down the difference rather than wasting more paper since I had the “certificate” on my phone as well. I went back and double checked Red McCombs’s inventory online to make sure that the specific car I wanted was in stock so I wouldn’t drive all the way over there for nothing and it was indeed there. 
I then visited Red McCombs and I found the car I wanted but with a SOLD sign parked under a tree on a windy evening and with a lot of bird stool on it. I decided it wouldn’t hurt to ask a salesperson if they had any more white automatic fr-s’s, so my family and I headed inside. As we walked in the door, we see many of the representatives standing around talking to each other and since many of them made eye contact with us, we thought we would be asked if we needed assistance. We walked in the showroom for about 5 minutes and no one bothered to approach us. I then went up to the front desk and informed the young lady I was interested in purchasing a car and if I could get someone to assist me, preferably someone who spoke Spanish to make the process easier for my mother who was the one that was going to buy the car. Immediately one of the men that were standing around socializing came up and offered his help. 
I was offered to take the white fr-s which had the SOLD sign on it for a test drive and then decide on what color to get if I didn’t like that particular one. As I walked around it, I noticed a couple of small, barely noticeable scratches (probably from being parked under the tree) but didn’t think anything of it at that moment. I then saw that the car I was test driving was not $26,xxx but $28,xxx because of some additional accessories. Overall, I knew that was the car I wanted but I couldn’t make a choice until after I saw the figures/numbers offered to us since it’s a big decision to make, especially around this time of year with jobs being so slow. I then made the salesperson aware that I had the truecar.com certificate which gave the specific car I wanted (without any accessories) a $26,xxx MSRP value. I also asked him if they had the $1,000.00 off MSRP of any scion promotion as stated on the scion.com website, but he did not know anything about that. By the way he looked at me and responded he made it clear he didn’t know what I was talking about, and I guess he left to show someone the paper. He then returned with the keys to test drive the car without mentioning anything about the truecar.com certificate or the promotion I had mentioned previously.
Upon our return from the test drive and after much walking around, the salesperson returned with the estimated prices and showed them to my family. During the time of the price discussion, I was with my fiancé test driving the car again so he could get a feel of what I was planning to get but by the time I returned I had missed out on the most important information, the price discussion. My family was walking out as I came back from the test drive and said they had been given a higher price compared to what we calculated. My fiancé and I returned inside to speak to the salesmen so he could clarify for us the price he had estimated but we weren’t shown the figures again. Instead, he went inside the main office and came back out explaining there wasn’t much they could do to reduce the price on the car more. I explained that I understood that and I wasn’t arguing that at all, all I wanted to see were the figures!  After he came out, some other guy came out from his office (he didn’t present himself nor did he greet us so I don’t know what his name is) using an angry and loud tone of voice and asked me whether the certificate I printed was for a 2013 or 2014 scion, which I had already explained to the previous salesperson and explained again to this other guy that I simply didn’t want to waste more ink and paper when there was only a $3.00 difference between the two MSRP’s; I could prove it by showing him the e-mail on my phone, but instead he cut me off and said that the MSRP he gave us was the same as truecar.com. I only stared at him with disbelief that he had just spoken to us like that!  He stared at us with a frustrated look as if we were stupid or were asking to have the car for free. All I needed was to see the paperwork but no one was nice enough to sit down and explain to me what is included in their estimate of more than $29,xxx which was the estimate even after they supposedly deducted the $1,000.00. The salesperson knew the car was for me which means I would pay for it, so why didn’t he wait to show me the numbers until I was present? After the rude guy talked to me like that I lost my patience and just walked out with no desire to go back. 
It seems like they were not interested in selling any cars since the salesperson was yawning during the whole time he was speaking to us, and the “manager” or whatever he was spoke so rudely to us before even asking what it was that we needed to be clarified in the first place. These people don’t seem to understand that the food they provide to their families on a daily basis as well as the gifts they will be buying these holidays for themselves and their loved ones come mainly from the consumers who purchase cars from their dealership! Unless we are millionaires and have money to throw out the window carelessly, as consumers and I as a college student especially, will always try to find a good deal since we are dealing with not just hundreds, but thousands of dollars.  So salesmen, don’t get mad when someone asks you if you can do anything to reduce the price of a vehicle because more than likely, the consumer already found out about the many ways they can save money. I personally informed myself well on the many promotions available at Scion at this moment and not a single one of the promotions I was aware of was mentioned to me until I brought it up. Being an owner of a small business, I know that promotions and special sales are the way to get more costumers to buy your products even if it means losing profit for some time because in the long run, you will gain the respect and loyalty of many customers. Other ways to gain and keep a customer are to be well informed about the products you sell, demonstrate interest in your job, provide care and attention to your customers, listen attentively to your costumers, but most importantly communicate in an educated manner! These are the many virtues some salesmen/ managers have yet to work on at Red McCombs Toyota/Scion. My visit to Cavender Toyota was much more pleasant. I was well received and assisted from the very moment I stepped out of my car and they made my first car buying experience one I will never regret. I love my new car!?

86,"September 08, 2013","I just returned from two back to back deployments and needed to find a vehicle.  After settling on the 2014 Scion tC, I came online to USAA for an Auto Loan. After qualifying, I saw that a New Car Buying Service was being offered in partnership with TrueCar.com so I signed up for it. On 26 August, I went to the dealer, Red McCombs, USAA/TrueCar.com has designated for my new purchase. As soon as I arrived on the lot, I was greeted by Cameron Gutierrez. I immediately told him that I was there under the USAA/TrueCar New Car Buying program and was there to see Mike Buffenbarger as his name was listed on my certificate. Cameron made no effort to go get Mike nor really seemed interested in my certificate or the USAA/TrueCar program. Cameron asked what I was looking for. I told Cameron that I wanted to test drive a manual 2014 tC but was likely going to need to order my car. I then asked for Mike again but Cameron told me that he was busy. I went ahead and completed my drive (this was my 5th drive after visiting several other Scion dealers,) As I knew that I wanted it. I told Cameron that I was very specific on my accessories. Cameron then brought me inside to sit so he could see about how fast he could order what I wanted. As we were about to move into the actual buying portion, I again asked for Mike as I wasn’t sure if I needed to speak to him to stay within the intended Car Buying Program. Cameron disappeared again. When he came back, he brought Estevan Garcia with him. Estevan explained that Mike was actually part of the internet team but Cameron was the actual salesman. I explained to Estevan that I was there for the USAA/TrueCar.com Car Buying Program. He just stated, “Yeah, yeah” but also showed no real interest when I tried to show him the certificate. Both Estevan and Cameron sat down with me to ask what I wanted in my vehicle. I was very clear with my accessories that I wanted. They both left to try and find my car. Estevan then returned with Cameron in tow to tell me that they located my car and it could be here in a day. He shows me the price.  I saw the car had more accessories than what I wanted and told him so. Estevan told me, “Well that’s how the car comes.” I stated that I wanted my car with the four accessories and that was all. He then tells me that to get the car I want, I will have to order it so I may be waiting for months since the dealership orders their inventory about 2 months out. I stated that I didn’t mind waiting. They both leave again. Cameron then comes back to me to ask for my name, phone number and email address. I tell him that he should already have my info as USAA sent Red McCombs my info and it was received as I had emails from the dealership that morning. Cameron stated that they didn’t have it and needed it again. He also wanted to clarify that I wanted navigation in my system and stated that he believed it was going to cost more but he would check. Again both Estevan and Cameron returned to tell me that my navigation was going to cost me $1,700 ON TOP of the $1,198 I was already going to pay for the premium stereo. That didn’t seem right to me at all so I asked them to remove that option. They both left again. When both returned, they told me they found the car and it could be there in a day or two. After adding the figures, I saw that it was still about $500 more than what I expected to pay. I asked what it was and Estevan stated that it was the dealer installed accessory package. I stated that I didn’t want it. Estevan told me that that is how the car comes. I told him again that I didn’t want it. Estevan then said he would go and see if he could take it off. As he left, I had felt I reached the limit of my patience. I was especially annoyed that this was not a Hassle Free experience that both USAA and TrueCar had promised. No one at Red McCombs was listening to what I wanted. Later, both men returned with more paperwork, this time showing the dealer package removed and of course, acting like they did me a huge favor. When I compared the prices, I still saw a $50 dollar discrepancy that I was curious about versus the certificate printed from USAA/TrueCar.com (that no one bothered to look at or acknowledge earlier.) When I asked what it was, both men stated that they didn’t know but had to ask. By then I was finished and decided to leave. As I walked into the parking lot, I was chased down by Cameron, Estevan and a man named George, who stated he was a manager. George was trying to get me back in by explaining the $50 difference. I was no longer interested and proceeded to leave the dealership. Later that day, I received a call from Cameron.  In order to get me to return, he offered to subtract the $50 in question and give me my window tint for free. (A $339 value.)  I was so put off from the dealership, I absolutely did not wish to EVER return. They were THAT awful to deal with and I would never send anyone there to buy a car. I instead went to Universal Toyota to conduct my business, so please see my review under that dealership.",1.0

During the paperwork process we were told that the car needed to have some door guards installed however it could not be done on that day because the person who did that was not available (this was on a Friday). We did advise that we were heading back home on Sunday and asked if a dealership close to home could install them for her and we were told that they thought it could possibly be done but would inquire and let us know for sure. Well needless to say we drove about 300 miles home and within 2 days we received a call advising my daughter that she needed to take the car back to San Antonio because it could not be done at a dealership close to home which made us furious in that fact that she needed to drive back adding 600 miles just for some door guards that only took seconds to install.

94,"September 26, 2012","I was looking for a new car and was interested in something with good gas mileage. My wife has arthritis and has difficulty getting out of vehicles if their seat is too low. 
We went to this dealership to see if she could sit in a Prius V to see if it is too low for her. 
We arrived at the dealership and found a Prius V outside. We looked around it for a couple minutes then I went inside to find a salesperson to help us.
When I walked inside I saw a desk with two young ladies seated at it. I walked up to the desk and both ladies had their heads down looking at their cell phones. They were texting or something I guess. I stood there, a couple feet from them at most for at least 40 seconds before one of them decided to look up and even acknowledge that I was there! 
I asked her if she could find me a salesperson and she got up and wandered in and out of offices for about 3 minutes before she came back and sat down. Without saying a word to me. Was someone coming, did she give up? I didn't know because she didn't bother to say and just went back to looking at her phone.
This alone should have been enough to tell me that customer service isn't this dealers strong point but I waited another minute or so before a man that looked in his 60s or so wandered out and asked me if I needed help. 
I explained my wife's issue and asked if he could show us to a Prius V we could sit in. He told me that they didn't have any Prius V's but said ""she could come in and sit in a regular Prius, they're the same thing"". Now, if they're the same thing (which I know the Prius V sits higher off the ground, I checked the specs on the website) why would Toyota make another model?
I told him that they had one outside, could he come out, let us in it and she can sit in it? He just repeated that they were the same, I should bring her inside to sit in the one in the showroom.
I said ok and just left. 
I'm dumbfounded by all this as I expected if I was willing to spend some money on a new car that I could expect the dealership be willing to help me out and sell me one. 
Apparently not this dealership.

101,"June 27, 2012","I was interested in the purchase of a used 2011 Toyota Corolla (stock #34375).  I asked the salesman Isaac Avelar if anything could be done to get a better price than sticker price of $16,495.  He said that he would have to go talk to his Manager.  Upon his return I was told that the price could not be lowered, however a Comprehensive Warranty could be included for this price to sweeten and close the deal with me. The offer was clear to me and there was no misunderstanding.  I was told specifically by Isaac that this was a great offer since the warranty could be valued at upwards of $2,500 and I would be getting that as part of the purchase price.  I agreed to the deal.   

Upon doing the paperwork with the Finance manager, the purchase contract had a separate line item for a comprehensive warranty with a price of $1,800.  I told him that that was not the agreement and that the price of $16,495 already included the warranty. He called Isaac and his Manager to discuss the agreement.  Their collective response was that there had been a misunderstanding but they could go ahead and give me the warranty for $1,000.  I pointed out to them that was not our agreement and that I should not have to even consider a discount on an ""upsell"" item since that was already supposed to be included in the purchase price.  

It was left as a ""misunderstanding"" and I told them that I was not going to do the deal and left the dealership.  

It was clearly a bait and switch tactic that I clearly discerned.  I was happy with the price only after I had been told I would have the warranty included.  

I do not seek any remediation but felt you should know the questionable business practices of your used car sales team.  I will be taking every opportunity to tell this story to every friend and relative to ensure they know how this store deals.

He didn't show me where my car was or anything. It took me a few minutes to find my car because other people's cars were in the way and my car was parked up on a little hill.

It seems that none of the sales staff there wanted to get off their butts and come out in the cold wind and talk to me. They had 2 vehicles I was interested in but I decided that it was time to try another dealership. (This was 2nd time I had stopped to look at a vehicle and couldn't get a salesman.) I tell you this because I was met by a salesman at your dealership moments after I stepped out of my vehicle when I arrived.

However, I really appreciate Doris Calderon for taking care of an error on the temp license plate and temp title.  The paperwork had been processed listing the vehicle as a 2011 instead of a 2012.  I came back to get it straightened out on Saturday 10/8/2011 but it was explained that was just temporary paperwork and the vehicle licensing would take care of it to show it was actually a 2012 when it was titled.  Since I was going out of town the next week I was not comfortable driving a vehicle with incorrect information on the plate and title which could have caused needless time spent by me and law enforcement authorities if it came to their attention for some reason.  I went back to the dealership on Monday 10/10/2011 and spoke to Doris Calderon at the customer service counter who appears very knowledgable about all aspects of the agency.  She explained it was a good thing that I had come in because the paperwork would not have gone through with conflicting information and would have caused further title delays down the road.  Calderon had someone in a back office prepare new temp tag and title with the correct information then had someone from sales replace the plate on my truck.  It may sound like a small thing in the scheme of things in a large dealership like McCombs but is going to mean the difference whether I come back there again or not.  Having people like Calderon in Customer Service to put customers in touch with the peple they need to see, or in this case empowere to quickly take care of problems within her control is key to a well run organization.

I hit something in the road, It ruined a tire. I live in a rural area quite a distance from SA. After going to 5 different tire shops and being told that the tires on the Sienna were pretty much specialized to the Sienna and they were not carried in a small town I called Alec rather upset. If the tire was going to be a problem finding I would have appreciated knowing this before needing one! Alec contacted Leah who contacted me. I would have a wheel and tire waiting for me at the dealership as soon as I could come in. I very much appreciated this and now if I ruin another tire I will have a good tire, not the donut, to make the trip to SA to get another. Since I carry my Grandkids and I also work with SA Great Dane rescue, I have more than just myself to worry about if I happen to mess up a tire and can't find another short of SA.

163,"August 09, 2011","I came in already knowing exactly which car I wanted and an appropriate price range that I would not go over and was able to speak with Shane of Red McCombs, and get an amazing, honest deal within ten minutes. I wasn't looking for an inexpensive deal, I preferred an honest one. I'm from Chicago where dealerships love to mess with you and tack on hidden fees but everyone I countered, from the woman at the front desk to the person that helped me finance, was so genuine and honest.

I am so happy with my experience at Red McCombs and can't wait to continue my relationship with the dealership as time continues!",5.0
164,"August 08, 2011","I have purchased and recommended many vehicles over the years to this dealership primarily in part due to the customer service, professionlism and support I receive. Lane Tokunaga is a top notch General Mangager and Hector Mancillas was great to work with. Red Mc Combs should be proud of his staff.        ",5.0
165,"August 08, 2011","Realistically, the main reason I've now bought SIX vehicles in the last six years from Red McCombs is because of the great sales experience I get from Rick Paskovich.  He is always very prompt with answers to questions, gives the customer a real feeling of working for the customer's best interest, and is a very plesant person to deal with when looking to purchas a vehicle.  I'm very aware there are other dealerships in San Antonio who MAY give us a better price, but the piece of mind Rick provides a customer is worth any additional funds I might have to pay for the same vehicle.  Rick's a great salesman.",4.8
166,"August 02, 2011","It was a pleasure doing business with Dustin and Yolanda. They are friendly,patient and very professional. They were able to answer all the questions I had about the Toyota Highlander,which made it easier for me to decide on purchasing the vehicle.

I consider Dustin and Yolanda to be an asset to your company. I would definitely recommend them to family members and friends that are interested in purchasing a vehicle.

I would also like to add that Dustin is doing a great job training Yolanda.

167,"August 02, 2011",Stephen made the experience as expedient as possible. He was very friendly and helpful. He worked hard to get me the best deal possible and made me feel that I was an important customer. It was important to him that I was happy with the car and the car-buying experience.,5.0
168,"August 01, 2011","We were very happy with our salesman, Stephen, and our overall experience. Stephen took his time with us, even though I was debating what vehicle I wanted to purchase. My wife and I came in to trade in and purchase a Tacoma. After I was trying to make up my mind, Stephen pointed us to the Camry's. We test drove the silver SE and my wife liked it so much, we went to work to purchase this one for her. As we were finalizing paperwork, I made up my mind to purchase a black Camry. They drove so smooth and looked terrific. The managers we encountered were very friendly and genuine. We met Chipp and GM, Lane. Stephen introduced us to almost everyone we encountered. We are repeat customers. We purchased two Camry's 5 years ago. We had the same experience. But Stephen kept taking us to everyone and telling them that we are repeat customers and had purchased two vehicles. He made us feel very special and the employees we encountered welcomed us and Thanked us for being their customers. Glenn and his boss, I can't recall his name, in finance. His boss gave us a terrific price on the extended warranty and oil change services. I don't recall this being offered last time. I take in our vehicles for every service. Frank Driffel and his service repair staff, Thomas, Jennifer, Mark, Winfred, and Melissa are all terrific. I trust each one to give me a fair and straight quote. ",5.0
169,"July 30, 2011","I was referred by a customer of McCombs Toyota. I also have known Ms. Wagner for about 20 years. She was so helpful and put me in touch with Shane Mitchell and we looked at different Tundras. Pricing was a big factor and Shane was able to give me a very good price for the truck I was looking for and also for my 2002 Tundra trade-in.  Once the deal was done I met with &quot;Doc&quot; Holliday to work out the financing and warranty details. He was very informative and helpful to me. He showed me many scenarios with all the options available. Overall I had a very pleasant experience in the purchase of my new Tundra. Everyone was so helpful and no high pressure tactics were used, which I really appreciated. I came back a day later to purchase a couple of accessories from Ernest Torres in the parts department and was treated like I was a lifetime customer. I felt very much at home and comfortable in all my dealings and the whole experience had a positive impact on my 20 year old daughter. She was so very impressed. I will be in the market for a Ford Edge in the near future and McCombs will definitely be a store we will shop. I look forward to visiting the service department for my service needs. Just a side note, I really like my new Crew Max Tundra and Shane did an excellent job, with the help of my daughter, to select tires and wheels to make my Tundra a unique truck on the road. Shane shows such pride in his job making the vehicles exactly what his customers are looking for. All the people I had dealings with in my opinion were very professional and knew their jobs and how to take care of the customer. ",5.0

Mike showed what the payments would be and how much it would be every month I didn't think the price would be so low!! I am very pleased with how friendly everybody was. I loved the atmosphere, and all the men looked fresh and clean. I like my experience and in 20 years come back for the latest Yaris. ",4.4
173,"July 20, 2011","Mike Buffenbarger should be commended for his customer service. From the very first day, he was very patient and kind and allowed me to ask tons of questions. He was very friendly and courteous and was not rushing me at all. Later on that week, I purchased my very first Scion from him, and I'm sure will not be my last!! Mike is the kind of salesman I want working FOR me (the customer) and not just trying to push every car at me just for a quick sale. I enjoyed my shopping/buying experience at Red McCombs Toyota/Scion and have already recommended him to others. Mike was a great guy from the beginning to the end of my sale. I very much appreciated that, and being in customer service myself, can respect someone who delivers it to me!

THANKS MIKE!!!
I frickin love my car!!!

174,"July 19, 2011","Jerry Reynolds, host of the AM 1200 radio show ""The Car Pro Show,"" referred me to Red McCombs Toyota for ""the best car buying experience."" Mario Castillo, Internet Sales Manager, and Lane Tokunaga, General Manager, treated me kindly and ensured my car-buying experience was comfortable and exciting. Glenn Fowler, Business Manager, was polite, but he hastily reviewed the financial paperwork and contracts, leaving me bewildered and uncomfortable. I felt I annoyed him when I asked certain questions and refused the extended warranty offer. This was my first car-buying experience, and I enjoyed it. It was exciting to drive off the lot in a new 2011 Toyota Camry SE!",4.8

There must be a reason why we keep coming back to Red McCombs to purchase our Toyota.  There is another dealership that sales toyotas, but we chose Red McCombs for simple reason that Richard has treated us right every time.  I would and have recommend people to see ya'll at Red McCombs.  Thank you.

Tripp was great as well and took care of items my husband wanted for the truck. Finance person was very professional and friendly as well.  I only stopped at McCombs Toyota by chance I had originally gone to Toyota of Boerne and they didn't seem to take me serious and chose to have a meeting while I waited. That is when I got up and walked out they called me back then asked where I was going to go.  I advised I would stop at the first Toyota dealership I see on the way back to town that happened to be McCombs. Thank you all for making this sale a pleasurable experience.",5.0

184,"June 30, 2011","Buying a car has always been a terrifying experience for me.  The time involved, the choices of models, options and colors and most of all, the haggle of prices are some of the things that I do not like to deal with.  Coming to Red McCombs Toyota has not been too bad as I had expected.  My wife and I met Mr. James English first.  He asked what our interests were, then he showed us various choices of mini van.  He took the time to explain what each model has and their differences were.  Furthermore, he also made his recommendation for the expected parents.  With his information, we were able to make our decisions easier and quicker.  Next, we were introduced to Mr. Dustin Hall for price discussion. At first, the negotiation was a little bit lengthy between both sides.  At the end of first visit, we did not come to an agreement on price and so we left. Because of having a good experience during the time being there with Mr. English and Mr. Hall, we decided to come back the second time for further discussion on price.  We finally came to an agreement and the van was sold to us.  When come time to pick up the van with all options added, Mr. English took the time to show us where the options added and some features of the van.  He even told us to give him a call if we have any question relating to the van.
Overall, because of the great customer experience that I had with Mr. English and Mr. Hall, I decided to make my purchase there.  I congratulate Red McCombs Toyota on having outstanding employees especially Mr. English.  He went above and beyond to help my wife and I to overcome the fear of buying a car.  I will recommend my friends, families and co-workers to buy car at Red McCombs Toyota in the future.",4.3

188,"March 31, 2010","After shopping around w/ my roommate for a Hihglander,we found exactly what she wanted, a ’09 Highlander Limited. She was leaving to go out of town the next day, but knew she wanted it, so they worked out all the financing over the phone, decided the bottom line # and she offered to buy it. Since she wasn’t in town, they offered to hold it if she would sign a letter of intent to buy and fax in her credit card information. He informed her all she needed to do was come in and sign the paperwork Monday. She called Monday to setup a time to come in to sign, only for them to tell her they sold the car. Even after speaking with the Sales Manager, he offered no explanation as to why, and never once apologized. Obviously, she was very confused and angry and had no plans to do business with them going forward.

The Sales Manager called her back yesterday letting her know they had another Highlander come in (same spec as the last one, but a different color), he wanted her to come look at, telling her he wanted to make things right. He told her they would do the same pricing, financing, etc. Reluctantly, she decided to go. 

When we arrived, the Sales Mgr’s supervisor met us outside to show us the car and quoting the price, which was 3K more than what she was told. She explained the only reason she even came back was because they said they were going to make things right and offer her the same pricing. He told her there must have been some miscommunication, because he could only come off the vehicle $500. She had him call the Sales Mgr, who had her come back, and asked if he told her he would sell the Highlander for the same price and the Sales Mgr claimed he didn’t say that. How convenient!

We are both very upset at this time, because she has been lied to several times now and driven all the way back across town for no reason. The Supervisor tells us we should calm down, that obviously we misunderstood, and it would be best if we came inside to talk in his office!!! (He didn’t want the other customers outside hearing our conversation and how upset we were w/ their customer service and experience). 

He never accepted fault in the whole situation, nor apologized until I mentioned I worked for Rackspace and would be sure to let everyone know of our experience. He then started apologizing and praising their efforts and things they do for the community. And how he would like to put gas in my car to make things right. LOL At that point, I let him know, we were not interested in doing business with a company with such poor customer service.

The overall experience was so bad, she decided against buying a Toyota all together.
