0,"July 27, 2015","I am a first time buyer so I was a little unprepared for the car buying experience.  Thank goodness for the honest and patient sales people at Alexander Ford.  They explained everything so thoroughly and really made me feel confident in my purchase.  Also, I will happily be letting Alexander Ford perform the service work on my car as well.  I was taken to the shop and got to meet the service techs and was impressed with their professionalism.",5.0
1,"June 23, 2015","The staff at Alexander Auto Center/Alexander Ford were great! They stayed open a few extra hours for us on a Saturday so we could drive from Angleton (77515) to Kenedy to view a truck. The finance manager was not only straightforward, but also a pleasure to do business with. The drive was well worth it, so much we plan to send everyone we can to purchase a vehicle from Alexander. Thanks again! ",5.0
2,"April 21, 2015","If you're looking for a dealership to buy your new or used Ford you won't find a better team than the one at Alexander Ford in Kenedy, TX.  After my sixth car buying experience Alexander Ford will be the only place I ever purchase again.  They simply beat any other dealership I've ever worked with in the past 15 years in every possible aspect.  The folks at Alexander Ford provide a personal buying experience that cuts through the normal stresses of purchasing a car/truck.  They treat you with care and respect and ensure you walk away completely satisfied with the best deal possible.",5.0
3,"June 18, 2013","I have been shopping around for a good used car and felt like I was being gouged by some of the dealerships located in and around my home.  However, I went to Alexander Ford in Kenedy and was treated so nice and so fair that it made me change my mind how I felt about car dealerships and their salespeople.  They gave me a more than fair price on my trade in and an even better price on the vehicle that I purchased.  I had researched my trade in so I had an idea over what I felt would be fair---they beat my expectation!  I really felt like they went the extra mile to make me happy!  They won me over and to be sure, I am telling all my friends and family to buy their vehicles from them.  ",5.0
