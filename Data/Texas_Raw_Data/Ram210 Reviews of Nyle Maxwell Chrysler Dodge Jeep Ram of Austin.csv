He had Excellent Customer Service skills and was very friendly! I most appreciate his authenticity, ability to listen, and comptence. Our primary concern was finding a vehicle my mother liked at a reasonable price. Jeffery said he would take care of her and he kept his word! I must say the process was smooth and QUICK without any pressure, unlike some other dealerships. My mom found a car she really likes and will enjoy!!
 
I just want to thank Jeffery, shout out to Bob, and Nyle Maxwell for creating a fun and positive car shopping experience!! Thank you for making my mom smile and making her day!! I recommend Nyle Maxwell car dealership! All positive vibes! They have your best interest at heart!! Keep up the Good Work & Be Blessed!!

1,"May 22, 2020","If you buy a car from Nyle Maxwell, make sure you work with Jeffrey Midence. My family and I got the exact vehicle we wanted and no games when it came to pricing. Jeff is a straight shooter and doesn’t drag things out unnecessarily, if he can make the deal he will. ",5.0
2,"May 01, 2020","I purchased a used 2012 Dodge Journey for my wife's business and paid almost 10k for it. I owned the vehicle less than 6 months and then the automatic transmission starting failing to shift. I had it towed at the expense of my insurance company and they took it to a local body shop. The mechanic just informed me that the transmission was shot and there was no servicing done of any kind to this vehicle. Now, I owe 6k on a vehicle that is probably going to cost me 4K in repairs. This was my first purchasing experience with them and will probably be my last. I am extremely dissatisfied with my purchase. As a Dealership, if you sell a vehicle you should ensure you have thoroughly inspected it prior to selling it. Not good business at all. I will make sure all of my military friends stay away from their establishment. ",1.0
3,"February 25, 2020","On February 15 I called Nyle Maxwell Dodge in Austin Texas. I asked to speak to a sales manager skipping the salesman process due to And already approved Chrysler financing previously approved car deal. After several attempts of calling the dealership I finally got a sales manager by the name of Chris Colburn. I gave him all the information regarding the approval, the trades involved, and filled out a credit application. CHRIS is shirred me that he would do everything he could to get the deal doneWith the unit that we wanted. Chris asked me to retrieve the approval code from the previous dealership that had gotten the approval. After I could not get it he then took his time about communicating with me. At this point I saw very little interest in him trying to help us. It took several text messages initiated by me to remind CHRIS of the car 
Deal we were anticipating. Chris had very little interest or at least showed very little interest in helping us. By the end of the fourth day we had also given up hope. I then moved onto a different dealership with the same process. I called Chris to and asked him for the approval code That he once asked me to get from a former dealership and his response was have somebody else do all the work. He then tried to tell me he worked on this deal for two weeks. His integrity went down the drain with a slew of text messages that are ready for me to post and to show Mr. Niall if he ever gives me a call. I have purchased two other vehicles from Nyle Maxwell. needless to say I will never shop there again. I am very disappointed with this individual especially because we have so many friends in common. Mr. Maxwell if you ever get to read this, in my opinion, you have the wrong person helping you and representing you in that dealership! Good luck! ",1.0
4,"October 13, 2019","It all started with the matts....

Bought a 2006 Dodge 1500, great truck good price. Problem was I came from Austin to buy it. When I went to pick it up (after hours) they didn't put any matts in the truck. When I saw the truck in-person, I didn't notice because it had paper matts I presumed over the real matts, or the real matts were being cleaned at the time... 

OK, then I asked them to mail the matts, they refused. 

Then I noticed the interior handles were, broken. Must have missed that during the test drive. They never told me. $200 in parts there...

Then the truck broke down less than a month later. Brick'd on the side of the road. My Mechanic told me the bearings were so worn out - any dealer should have noticed and replaced before selling the truck. In fact, they were so mad, they wanted to call the dealership themselves. Nyle Maxwell again refused to do anything.

The worst part of everything - they sold a headlights, seats and gap-insurance as a package (I'm an idiot, of course it didn't have to be a package) but when I went to use it to fix the hole in my seat, the coverage DIDN""T EVEN APPLY TO MY CAR (had to have leather seats, it has felt). So they just keep giving me the run around when I ask for my money back on a policy that didn't even apply to the car they were selling. 

So at the end of the day, these guys absolutely ruined my buying experience, bunch of liars!",1.6
5,"October 03, 2019","      I will admit that I do not know a lot about cars.  I know enough about general maintenance and upkeep but when it comes to potential major issues I'm not a mechanic or car expert by any means.  And being a woman on top of that and having heard horror stories from friends and families of experiences they have had being taken advantage of purchasing used cars I wanted to go to a reputable dealer.  
       I purchased a used vehicle from Nyle Maxwell, what I thought was a reputable dealership.  I had previously purchased a used vehicle from them years prior and it had been a plesant experience so I returned to buy my next family car. Purchasing a used vehicle I knew that there would maintenance and upkeep required.  
      When I purchased the vehicle from day 1 the low tire light was on and there was an intermittent squeek.  I brought it back right away for the light, took time off work to do so and was told it was fixed.  Sure enough the light went off but came right back on after a day or so.  I didn't have time to take it in a second time in a week so I called my mechanic since the tire pressure was still good and he said with it being an older vehicle it could very likely be the sensor is out so just keep a close watch on the tire pressure.  Fast forward to several months later.  The light is of course still on but that intermittent squeek started to get worse.  Then it turned into a constant squeek.   I took into my mechanic thinking maybe it was the brakes and was told the brakes are good but that the axle was bent and that it looked like some of the parts had been replaced as they were not original. My mechanic also provided a video of both the bent side and the non-bent side to show the difference.  I have not been in any accidents or hit/run over anything since I purchased this vehicle.  I was not informed by Nyle Maxwell of any previous damage or accidents. And this was not the type of bent axle that caused the vehicle to ride rough so I would not have known there was an issue. 
     The squeek was present upon purchase...so wanting to give Nyle Maxwell the benefit of the doubt and again thinking that maybe this was just an honest mistake I tried to contact the used car division.  I waited a couple weeks to give them time but no reply.  Then I contacted anyone with an email address at Nyle Maxwell in the service/used car division (sent emails to 4-5 different people) got 1 reply who asked for more info.  I replied weeks ago and have yet to hear back from him despite trying to follow up with him.  This has been going on for months now.  In the mean time I'm a single parent.  The squeek is getting worse.  I'm told the cost to repair my ""new car"" is going to be $2k!!!  I depend on this car for work, to get the kids to and from school, sports, band events and now I don't know how long I can depend on this vehicle that I just purchased.  
    I saved up and spent a lot of money to buy this car for my family.  So to find out I was sold a vehicle with MAJOR damage and then have this ""reputable"" dealership shrug me off and not take ownership of their mistake is hugely concerning.  
     If they knew about the damage and didn't disclose then that shows they are a dishonest dealership trying to take advantage of people such as myself that would not know better.  If they didn't know of the damage then their research of the cars they sell and used car certification process missed a huge and a potential safety hazard with mine.  ",1.0
6,"September 07, 2019","WORST SERVICE EVER!!!! We called this dealership, explained the situation and were told to take the car first thing in the morning and it could be seen without an appointment. So we took it there first thing in the morning (before they even opened), explained the same thing and were told we would need an appointment. The service rep took notes, got our contact info and said we'd receive a call to schedule an appointment. NO ONE EVER CALLED. We called back SEVERAL TIMES, left a few voice messages and no one answers the phone (other than the receptionist). No one answers the phone or returns calls. We asked to speak to the manager and guess what? He doesn't pick up the phone either. I'll never buy a dodge again if this is the crappy service I have to deal with. WORSE DEALER, DO NOT RECOMMEND.",1.0
7,"September 03, 2019","BY FAR THE WORST EXPERIENCE IVE EVER HAD IN A VEHICLE PURCHASE!!  DO NOT BRING YOUR BUSINESS HERE AND IF YOU DO JUST HOPE AND PRAY THAT IT NEVER NEEDS SERVICE!!  ERIC TIPPETT (SERVICE DIRECTOR) BOLD FACE LIED ABOUT THE DIAGNOSES OF MY TRUCK BECAUSE HIS SERVICE TECH TOOK IT FOR A ROAD TEST WHEN THE ENGINE LIGHT WAS BLINKING, I HAD GIVEN THEM A FULL REPORT OF WHY I BROUGHT IT IN AND IT NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN ROAD TESTED!  IT RESULTED IN CATASTROPHIC ENGINE DAMAGE.  HE SUGGESTED I CONTACT MY INSURANCE COMPANY TO SEE IF THEY WOULD COVER IT UNDER A COMPREHENSIVE CLAIM?!?!?!    THE TRUCK RAN WHEN I HAD IT DROPPED OFF YET HE SAYS IT WAS HYDROLOCKED DUE TO WATER INGESTION.  THE ONLY WATER THE TRUCK HAD SEEN IS RAIN AND WHEN I TOOK IT TO THE CARWASHES!!  HYDROLOCKED ENGINES DO NOT RUN!!  AGAIN, IT RAN WHEN IT WAS DROPPED OFF.  I BOUGHT THE TRUCK ON MARCH 15TH.  I DROPPED IT OFF ON JULY 10TH.  YES, THATS LESS THAN 4 MONTHS FROM THE DAY I BOUGHT IT.  NOW I HAVE A $28,000 TRUCK THAT NEEDS A NEW MOTOR AND THEY REFUSED TO GIVE ME LOANER SO IVE BEEN WITHOUT TRANSPORTATION FOR ALMOST 2 MONTHS.  HAD THE TRUCK TOWED TO SOUTH POINT DODGE WHERE THEY CONFIRMED THE TRUCK WAS NOT HYDROLOCKED DUE TO WATER INGESTION??   I HAD A CONVERSATION WITH MIKE TIPPETT AND THE GM MIKE WILSON TO CONFIRM THAT THEY WOULD NOT DO A THING TO REPAIR THE TRUCK AND THATS EXACTLY WHAT THEY OFFERED.  NOTHING!!!   I HAVE A TWO YEAR OLD SON THAT I CANT TAKE TO DAYCARE, IVE LOST TWO JOBS BECAUSE OF THE WHOLE MESS AND NOW IM FALLING BEHIND ON THE TRUCK PAYMENT.  SUCH A NIGHTMARE AND ONE xxxx OF A LESSON FROM A DEALERSHIP THAT PRIDES THEMSELVES QUITE A BIT HERE IN CENTRAL TEXAS.  DON’T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID!!!  TAKE YOUR BUSINESS TO PEOPLE THAT CARE ABOUT MORE THAN THE MONEY THEY MAKE OFF OF YOU.  TAKE IT TO A DEALERSHIP THAT ACTUALLY STANDS BEHIND THEIR CLAIM OF SERVICE AFTER THE SALE.  MY CREDIT IS TAKING A BEATING AND SEEING THAT I WAS ALREADY REBUILDING MY LIFE AFTER AN UGLY CUSTODY BATTLE IM NO FURTHER AHEAD NOW THAN I WAS THE DAY I BOUGHT THE TRUCK.  IM ACTUALLY IN WORSE SHAPE NOW.   AGAIN, DONT GET TAKEN TO THE CLEANERS LIKE I HAVE BEEN.  THERE ARE PLENTY OF GOOD DEALERSHIPS HERE IN AUSTIN THAT ARE HONEST, HAVE INTEGRITY AND CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS.  THESE GUYS DON’T!!!   NOT EVEN A LITTLE!!   I WISH I KNEW HOW THEY SLEPT AT NIGHT BECAUSE MY CONSCIOUS DOESNT LET ME DO ANYTHING REMOTELY CLOSE TO WHAT THEY HAVE DONE!!   IM DISGUSTED, UPSET, EMBARRASSED AND NOT SURE HOW I AM GOING TO GET OUT OF THIS MESS.   THANKS NYLE!!   I APPRECIATE YALL SO VERY VERY MUCH!!   OH!!  DONT LET ME FORGET TO TELL YOU NOT TO PURCHASE ANY EXTENDED WARRANTIES FROM THEM EITHER.  THE ONE THEY ROLLED INTO THE PRICE OF MY TRUCK AT $2,770 ISNT EFFECTIVE UNTIL THE TRUCK HITS 100K MILES AND THE FINANCE GUY WILL SHRUG HIS SHOULDERS WHEN YOU INQUIRE ABOUT WHAT IT COVERS.  IM TRYING TO GET THAT COST REMOVED FROM MY FINANCED TOTAL NOW.  STEER CLEAR EVERYONE!!!

I have purchased 6 Jeep products in the past from Mac Haik Jeep in Georgetown TX. The final product was the 2014 Jeep Latitude. Within 2400 miles I had encountered problem after problem with the transmission. 13 separate times my wife was stranded on the side of the road. Mac Haik continued to tell me that is was just needing a relay reset. They refused to take any other action. They treated me as if  I was an inconvenience to them. After spending over 200K in 9 years with them; I was done with Jeep! 
  Until I found Nyle Maxwell.  I stopped by to make an appointment for a  oil change.The service manager informed me that they could have the job completed right away. Wow this was not how it was done at the other place. So as they took back my 2012 Jeep Wrangler I strolled the parking lot.I was greeted by a sales person that was not pushy, We struck up a mild conversation about the new 2015 Jeep JK 4 door. He went inside and returned with the keys. and asked if I wanted to take it home for the evening. I did and within 4 hours I had to have it. I called my salesperson and he made it happen without haggling on what I was willing to pay, or what I wanted for my trade.This was the start of my relationship with Nyle Maxwell.
 So for the service department. They have been OUTSTANDING!! 
I also purchased the 2017 Jeep Compass Trailhawk that was consuming too much oil.  The service team did 3 oil consumption tests and had concluded that there was a serious problem with the engine.  Instead of digging through the engine and getting the runaround; my service advisor arranged for a rental car and completely replaced the engine.  I can not say enough about the service team. I recently had an issue with the on/off relay switch. A first the team felt is was just a low battery. But instead of returning the vehicle they LISTENED to my feedback and further researched the underlying concern and kept the auto for a another day and replaced the wiring harness that lead to the problem. 
Not only did that correct the problem, but they serviced my oil at no charge. Once again the service was beyond my expectation. Nyle Maxwell has rebuilt my trust in Jeep,

9,"July 15, 2019","This was nice and when buying a car, however the one thing it was supposed to due was transfer my disable plates over. And since the website didn't allow to the dealer to do that cause the title had changed names before they registered the car. They went ahead and just registered for normal plates. Due to the fact I know they did not call the DMV or they would have known they needed to call the Tax office to correct this and gave me 5 different excuses about why they couldn't do what they were supposed to. This lady in charge of this process acted like I was the most unreasonable person because I  wanted to know why she did not complete a very simple task I now have to wait for the tax office to process paper work which they said to call back in 30 days to correct this. If you are disabled or need special plates my suggestion is to buy a car elsewhere.",1.0
10,"February 27, 2019","Go elsewhere!!  Went to their paint and body shop to get a vehicle repaired. My teenage son backed into a girl at school and broke her grill.  Met the Dad up their, filled out a work order in my name and received a quote. We didn't use insurance because we didn't want our rates to go up and I paid $500 down for the parts. While they were repairing, I get a voice mail that says its going to cost $600 more dollars. Instead of calling back, I show up to look at the damage that needs more parts. She has a surprised look on her face and said I cant look at the car its illegal because I don't own the vehicle. I ask to see the work order that's in my name and she said that's against the law and illegal even know I'm paying for it. I tried calling the Dad and she leaves the room. After I returned home, I got a call and she told me I can look now..  I said its to late, I don't trust you, just give me the total. She gives me the total and I tell her, Ill pay for it because I'm over a barrel, the car is in parts and they need their vehicle back, also I think this is a crooked deal!! She hatefully says, HAVE A NICE DAY, and hangs up on me.
While I was home, I went online and couldn't find anything close to it being illegal, especially when I'm paying for the service. I truly believe they are padding the bill and are very shady.
 This is my teenage sons money they are taking and will be the last dollar they receive from us or anyone I know. I will warn my friends and family to stay clear from this dealer.

The response I received was what I expected, Bla, Bla, rhetoric. There's a pattern in your response. It looks like you just copy and paste your response. I looked at the bad reviews ( I stopped counting after 100)  all you say is about the same thing, sorry, we try to please, call us. None of the complaints are fixed. You take a complaint and work to resolve. There's a reason they are still complaints. They were never fixed.  I'm going to advise all that I can about your practice.",1.0
11,"February 23, 2019","Was interested in a vehicle that just came in on trade. Talked with an online sales consultant named Roel. He informed me it was still available and that they were finishing up the inspection. First thing following morning i informed i was planning on coming on my lunch break to look at it. Was told he has the keys and was waiting for me. As i was on my way, he informed me they let another customer take the car and customer later bought that car. No respect or any ability to be an honest stand up guy. Definitely not purchasing a car here. ",1.4

14,"January 29, 2019","About two months ago we took our 2017 Chrystler Pacifica Limited in because we had SEVERAL issues. Our third row was stuck, the navigation screen would just freeze, our suspension had an issue, and the transmission was having a hard time transitioning from 1st to 2nd gear. It took them a few weeks before we could even get the vehicle in. Once we finally did we were offered a loaner vehicle (which was nice) and when we asked how long it would be there then said maybe a day or two. A week later, after absolutely no updates, we call and find out that parts had to be ordered for the suspension and they were still waiting on them. No one had called us to update or notify us of that. At that point we just told them we really needed our vehicle and we'd come pick it up. They had fixed the third row and navigation screen and TOLD us the transmission issue was fixed. They said they would call us when the suspension parts were in and we could bring the vehicle back then. While driving the van home we learned the transmission HADN'T been fixed. We waited a few weeks and never got any updates on the parts so we called back to find out they had arrived a week or so before. So we scheduled to bring our vehicle back (but the wait was three weeks). 

Fast forward to today. I am still waiting on our van. We dropped it off last week and when we did I had STRESSED that we needed it back yesterday because we leave for a road trip to Utah tomorrow. After (again) calling them for updates, we were informed that the part they needed to fix the transmission was on backorder and they had no idea how soon it would arrive, but they did place a rush order on it. After contacting Jonathan again this morning he had their rental manager call me. I explained that we really needed ANY larger vehicle. We are traveling with two young kids so we needed room for a pack n play, stroller, bedrails, suitcases, etc. The rental manager told me that he couldn't lend us one of their rentals because we would be putting too many miles on it, but he could refer me to Hertz. Hertz could give me a discount of $35/day but only WHILE our vehicle was still being serviced. So say if, the part arrived the day after we left, we'd lose that discount for the remained of the 3 week trip. So I confirmed with him that we would now have to pay for a rental out of pocket because this issue hadn't been correctly fixed the first time and he said yes. after looking up rental costs, that would be approximately $1700 out of pocket for us.

So at this point I'm waiting (again) for someone to contact me. At this point I think I might tell them to put the van back together and we will just roll the dice. 

The communication at the service center is absolutely HORRIBLE. You have to reach out if you need answers. And expect a looooong wait time just to get an appointment and then a long wait time while it's being serviced. Our other car is a Kia and we've never experienced this kind of lack of communication or wait time with that dealership. 

I'm giving one star because Angela was the only person I spoke to who acted sympathetic and was able to get my unanswered calls returned.",1.0
15,"November 02, 2018","On Thursday September the 13th the time of the test drive before the purchase of a new 2019 RAM 1500 there was 2 issues noticed, The rear seat recliner and the rear tire pressure sensor not working, It was addressed to the salesman and the sales manager I was told and I quote ""its nothing it'll be fixed on Monday just bring the truck back and we will take care of everything on Sep 17th"". between the purchase date the 13 and 17 the tire pressure sensor caused a leak in the valve and left me with a flat tire which I had to change with the spare and put air in it and switch back again 4 times! At this point I called the dealership and raised my concern once again they said ""everything will be fixed when you drop it off on the 17th"". I dropped off the truck and they called me a few hours later saying the ""truck is ready for pick up the air leak is fixed and they have to order parts for the rear seat recliner and the rear tire pressure sensor"" (this is 4 days after the sales why did you order the parts right away?) The ETA the gave me was end of September and then no phone calls! On October 1st I called the dealership 4 times to get a hold of someone and finally I was told the parts are on back order it,ll be another 3 weeks again no phone calls from the dealership I called back on Oct 25 This time the dealership agreed to take the needed parts from another truck and put them on my vehicle to get me going they said and I quote"" We have you on schedule for Monday Oct 29th to fix everything we'll give you a call to setup the time"" Again no phone calls, I call the dealership 3 times on the 30th of October to get a hold of someone the respond was ""I don't know let me check"" then they call me back and say Carlos the new car director said were not going to do that the customer has to wait until the parts come in, When I asked for the ETA on the parts they said ""It could be end of November or end of December We're not sure"" And to top it all I never received my customer survey, Is the dealership holding that back or used the wrong email so I don't give you a bad survey? My question is to Mike Wilson the GM and Nyle Maxwell the owner, How can you allow your staff to misinform and lie to customer just to make a sell move on and then ignore the customer? This was such a small issue on a brand new vehicle and ruined the name of the dealership and the brand for me! If this is what you stand for It's a shame.",1.0
16,"August 01, 2018","I bought a used car from them 2 years ago and All I asked for was Bluetooth and a trailer hitch. When I test drove the car it had Bluetooth we even paired my phone to it. once the deal was done and I picked up the car they had pilled the chip out of it and wanted me to pay them an additional 600.00 Since then I have gone in there to look for a car for myself and for my son and each time they pull the bait and switch. i have had to walk out of there over 8 times for this same issue. They will have a price on the internet and after you talk to someone and they get you in there before the deal is done they will change the online price and want you to pay 2000 more. Again this has personally happened to me several times. I have been to other dealer who say they get a lot of business from their angry customers. some of those other deals are Covert, Sames, Benny, and even Nyle Maxwell  in Taylor all have heard of this same issue from this company. They pulled the same thing 3 weeks ago and yesterday. So I bought from another dealer. Don't go there you will not get the deal you thought. ",1.0

Found the Jeep I liked agreed on a price with the sales team.  Found a babysitter and brought my wife back to finalize the deal.  Sales Manager completely changed the AGREED UPON numbers and said nothing they could do.  My salesman Anastasios was GREAT but unfortunately the sales management team messed up multiple times on the numbers.  They agreed to the number then when I got back they said they couldn't do it.  Then came back and said they could.  Then came back 1 last time to say they couldn't.  It was very unprofessional and embarrassing for them.   I was not sold on a specific vehicle and would have been more than fine looking for something closer to my price point.  Instead they lied and wasted my entire day.  And the kicker on my way out they offered me a free tank of gas for my trouble!  No thanks I wasn't here for free gas.

104,"August 28, 2017","Visited Maxwell Super Center on 5 August to see about buying a new car for my wife.   The sales rep - Frank was never fully plugged in.  He seemed distracted during the process.
My wife told Frank the parameters of what she was looking for - new, not used; color; trim level, etc.  Frank looked in the inventory and said he had a close match.  Grand Cherokee Limited in the right color.  It was appointed a little above what my wife was looking for, but very nice.  Wife drove it and liked it.  I did not drive it as it was for her, and being new should not need too much scrutiny.  My bad.  Won't make that mistake again. 
  We negotiated a fair deal.  Not great, but fair.  Got right at trade-in for the Wrangler she was trading.  We progressed to the finance and contract phase.  I must say, the gentleman working the finance and contract office is terrific.   He provided good guidance and complete and transparent information.
This is where my alarms began to tingle.  The ""new"" car already had 500 miles on it.  No one up to this point had disclosed this fact, or what the car had been used for in that 500 miles.  I was instantly concerned and neededto make sure there were no issues with the car that I was not privy to.  I was assured that if we found anything wrong, it would be taken care of.  We moved on through the process and completed the deal.
Once at home and going through the car to learnnit, we discovered a small stone chip in the windshield, and a broken mirror in the passenger visor.  Small items, indeed, but needed correction on what was supposed to be a new car

I began the process of trying to get them fixed.  I called Frank, the sales rep first. It took 2 days to actually get hold of him.  He said he would get with the service dept immediately.   I gave him a day to make coordination then reached back out to him.  It took the better part of 2 more days to find out Frank doesn't work there any more.  So now I began the escalation process to find someone to address the issues.  2 calls to the service department went un answered.  I began moving up the chain to find a manager.  Finally I got hold of Kyle Sessions who said he would take my issue to the GM or New Sales manager for resolution.   Another day.  Teaching back in to the dealership I found Kyle on line, who contacted the manager again.  Subsequently Darren, the new sales director cobtacted me and we began the plan to get these issues taken care of.  Last Saturday, 26 August, the visor was fixed complely.  Jonathan Casper of the service department took excellent care of is.  The windshield ding would need to be coordinated.  I've not gotten any further information on this issue. 
SO - after the sale service has taken a bit of pushing, but is being taken care of.  I am concerned about not having been told the was used for 500 miles before being sold to us, and what thatbusage might have been.  That should have been discussed right up front.  Feels like it was not mentioned so I would not ask for any consideration in the pricing.
I am not ready to say this dealership should be avoided - heck, over the years I have purchased 4 or 5 vehicles here - but I am certainly wary at this point.  Something is amiss. ",4.2

108,"August 22, 2017","1. My 2005 Dodge Ram 2500 diesel truck had a $2788.83 transmission overhaul 06/13/2014 at Nyle Maxwell Chrysler Dodge Jeep of Austin, 13401 Ranch Road 620 North. The warranty was good for two years. The current transmission problem was out of warranty even though it was back in the shop for an identical problem 10/2015 (inside the warranty period). I believe the original transmission rebuild had failed at that time and they tried to band aid the problem choosing to not fix the problem by doing another transmission rebuild/replace at their expense. Note. The transmission now is so much better after the current complete rebuild.  It was not this good after the original 06/2014 rebuild.  I did not know enough to compare the original rebuild 06/2014.
2. Nyle Maxwell Chrysler Dodge Jeep of Austin, 13401 Ranch Road 620 North replaced the transmission again 8/15/2017 for 4611.88. In view of the fact that I had the truck in the shop 10/2015 (inside the warranty period) for a problem identical to the current problem (the truck did not start in low) I feel Dodge should have paid part of the cost of this second rebuild. 
3. They kept the vehicle for three weeks. During this time I had great difficulty making contact to get updates. ""The truck is being worked on"" was used several times.  The truck was usable so I could have kept the truck until they could actually work on it.",2.3

Came by on a Saturday afternoon, walked inside the showroom and literally had to find a salesman to assist me. Not a great start. A Manager grabs a salesman by the name of Israel, who is very nice and proceeds to show me the vehicle and enable a test drive. The rest of the visit goes fine, and I leave my information with Israel letting him know that I was seriously considering the vehicle. I give Israel a call on Monday afternoon once I'm back home (keep in mind I live in Dallas, a 3 hour drive from Austin) to let him know I've decided to pursue the vehicle and begin negotiations on price. I make an offer, and he proceeds to say, ""Sir, I""ll run this by my sales manager and get back with you in a few minutes. We're going to get you a xxxx of a deal."" TWO DAYS go by and I never received a call. I then call and ask to speak with a Manager and Wednesday, but had to leave a voicemail. STILL no call back all week long. Finally, Saturday morning, Israel leaves me a voicemail asking if I'm still interested in the vehicle, acting as if I never called to make an offer on the vehicle. Absolutely rude and ridiculous.

Not only did this dealership lose out of a sale from me, (I purchased the same vehicle from a different dealer that week) but they also lost out on any chance of my business in the future.

Went in today to trade in my 2015 Ford Escape Titanium on a 2015 Dodge Challenger RT they had on the lot that was blue, with a sun roof. They had the car listed at $26K on their website with 19,000 miles. This sounded ""too good to be true"" but I thought I'd check it out. When I got there the sales lady informed me that another salesman was working on a deal with someone else on the car. With that being said we test drove a few Dodge challengers, one a 2011, was in REALLY bad shape, and looked to have been an abused car. It had 38,000 miles or so, and they were still asking $25K. The brakes were shot, and the tires were bald. I quickly passed on that car, and decided to drive a new one. It was window sticker priced at $43,000 but they had it on sale for $38,000 The price was still kinda high but I decided to see what they'd offer me for my car.

Mind you I drove in with a 2015 Ford Escape Titanium, not an S, or SE, but a fully loaded Escape with optional 2.0 liter ecoboost engine, leather seats, sony 10 speaker stereo, leather, memory seats, remote start, etc. I've only put 6,100 miles on the car since May 2015.

They came back with an offer of ONLY$19,000... if that wasn't bad enough, they then proceeded to tell me that they want me to put $6,000 cash down, and my payments would be around $893 a month for 84 months.....You hear right $75,000 for a Dodge Challenger, not even a hellcat, or SRT8.

I requested my keys and I left. I'm so upset that I even went there in the first place. I've heard of getting screwed out of a trade in, but this was RIDICULOUS!

Unless they can find me a blue Challenger R/T with a sunroof, and low miles for around $26K, give me what I want for my trade in, AND a decent payment. I think I'll stick with Ford. I've owned 5 mustangs, and 2 Escapes, all have been Financed through Ford at 0-1.9% with $0 down.

I had called about 3+ weeks ago to find that my truck would not even be looked at until now. Once I had dropped my truck off the curtsy driver had left for the evening which in turn I had an 1 1/2 hour wait for a ride. The following day I had called to check on my vehicle to find out something which a blind man could of about my exhaust leak and it would be 3+ days for this repair. With having a family and needing a vehicle they said I can come get a rental after waiting for 1 1/2 hours the night before and knowing there would be an extended wait for the repair.

Drop off, Tuesday October 27th had to go to the service director to get a loaner because otherwise i would have to pay for a hertz rental.  took forever to get the car, and made me extremely late for work.

Friday the 30th, i get a call that my jeep is ready.  I ask the service guy if its all dried out, and he tells me its all dry and ready to be picked up.  ten minutes later he calls me back to tell me the jeep is still wet and they will need to keep it over the weekend.  They are going to remove the seats & the carpet to ensure it gets completely dried out. I'm slightly irritated, but hey at least he checked right?

Monday afternoon (November 2nd) I get a call - hey your jeep is ready.  Well i cant pick it up till Tuesday morning, so no big deal.  Ill be there in the morning.

Tuesday morning, i go to pickup the jeep.  Its still all wet.  Seriously wet.  I'm told that they dont remove the seats and carpet to dry it, they just shop vac the jeep.  Of course the service guy who was working with me wasn't there.  Later that afternoon, i'm told the jeep is now ready for pickup.  only a few hours, and its all dry when they had to keep it all weekend before?

I get there Wednesday morning to pick it up, and its still wet.  I'm told by the service manager that jeeps cant rust because they are sealed on the inside.  Metal + water exposed to air = rust.  also it smells.  that smell is mold & mildew.  this is what happens when fabric gets wet and isnt dried out & cleaned.  Of course they will shop vac it again if i like.  So i take my jeep and leave.  (they also burned half my gas letting the thing sit running with the heat blasting to dry it)  As soon as i drive off i notice somethings not right.  They ripped the wiring out of my amp when they were ""fixing"" my jeep, and just didnt bother to fix that as well.  When i noticed this i looked closer at the seats, trim , etc.... they didnt install the floor trim correctly.  they left it half installed, with gaps to allow dirt and water into the car.  I took it right back, and had words with the general manager.

Of course they couldnt do anything because the service department was already closed by now.  So Thursday morning I have to drop it off yet again to have what they screwed up fixed.  By now I am beyond pissed off.  I do get a call telling me that the jeep is fixed Thursday afternoon, but because of work i cant pick it up till Friday morning.

Friday morning comes, (today - now November the 6th) im at the dealership to finally get my ""fixed"" Jeep.  I look it over, and this time i make sure to check the wiring on my amp, the subs are going, the trim looks right.  Fine, im over this place, im leaving.  As im driving down the road i notice that my seat belt light is on, and so is the airbag light.  I pull over to a gas station and look under the seat.....when they actually removed the seat this last time, they didn't bother to reconnect the wiring when they reinstalled it.

Finally I tried the gas trucks and decided that is not what I wanted.  I was getting ready to leave, she comes back with an offer that I agree on which is all based on lots of MFR rebates and dealer rebates one being dealer financing.  They sold it to me for more then I wanted to spend, shame on me for not thoroughly reading through everything.  I did the financing through them because of the rebate but turns out they did my loan through one of their other lenders so I lost that, didn't even tell me.  Could have just used my credit union and never messed with them.  They didn't top off the DEF fluid so it was already getting down to the Red, I didn't know what it was until I started looking it up.  Then to add insult to injury, they could have made up the difference in the dealer financing piece by simply offering to activate my GPS and maybe put in a spray on bed liner and I would have been good but the only thing they offered was maybe a 100 dollars off the activation.  I can own up the 1000 dollars I over looked but that other 1000 for the dealer financing they screwed me on should have been compensated for.  I really did start off with a good experience its just sad they did nothing to try and solve the issues the created, instead just showed me numbers that I actually walked away from to begin with.

190,"June 09, 2015","I bought a 2015 Chrysler 200 on Feb 23 2015 it had 7000 miles on it. The car died as I was going into an intersection, it locked up.  The dial shift and the steering would not move. I barley got passed the white lines before it stopped or I would have been in the middle of the intersection on 6/7/2015. As I was trying to get it started I google what was reading in the dash to figure how to get it started again.  Anyway I seen the reviews online and seen that this very same problem had happened to a lot of people all over the US. Such even having problems fixing it, the computer not reading what's wrong, ect. Go to car complaints. Com,( READ)!!!!!!!. I had my car towed to the dealership that very same day. The next day from reading all the reviews I figured just like everybody else that this car is a death trap. I'm scared to drive this car and wouldn't dare put my kids in it. I tried to trade it in, that was a joke. I paid $19,000 for it and they wanted to give me $14,000 for it and I had only had it for 3 mos. Put 3000 miles on it, it was in the same shape as I bought it. This problem was a manufacturer problem. Plus I had paid for the extra warranty witch was $4,000. They offered to give me only $2,000 back on that witch would go to my value car.  All I can say is that I'm getting it fixed right now and it'll probably take 2 weeks until I get it back, if they don't fix it the right way the first time and the 2nd time around I half to bring it in, I will be heard, that whole place will know who I am.  FIX IT!!!!! This makes me so angry that I would never do business with them ever again. Now I'm in the hole of $22,000 with a lemon car that I'm pretty sure that they knew about when they sold it to me. When I told them about what I've read and what happened they acted like they didn't even know. That's a bunch of BS. If I was a manager I would want to know what was going on and where to find the information at about whats wrong with this vehicle.  They didn't even ask for the website because they already know about these issues. Maxwell Dodge , Austin, Texas, off of 620 are dishonest and all they think about is there money. They don't care about how much money they rip you off for or even if your family dies in there cars. They only think about the green. ",1.0

I am very dissatisfied with my experience. I dropped off my jeep at noon and was told it would be ready by five. I called shortly after five and they had no paperwork on my jeep. After 20 minutes they called me back and said that they were very busy and were not able to get to it.
Most likely they lost the paperwork and wouldn't admit to it. I had to rearrange my schedule and had to get a guarantee from Kevin that it would be ready between 9 and 930 in the morning. The jeep was ready at 9:30 with minutes to spare. I already had a ride on the way because I couldn't be late for a meeting with a client, (customers don't like to be kept waiting and I respect that).
 
On top of all of that I was charged for shop supplies which we all know is just way to pad the profit.
I had to ask for a 10% coupon from an offer I found online but it wasn't sent to my email, they reluctantly gave it to me. The discount pretty much just covered the cost of the bogus shop supplies, that was not part of my estimate to begin with.
The only response I got back from  the dealer about this was a weak excuse on how a tech fell two weeks prior and they were shorthanded. 
That has absolutely nothing to do with not having a vehicle ready and the promised time when you already know you're short staffed.
I will never return. Read all the yelp reviews. Especially the ""not recomended"". Those were from people who have only done one review because they signed  up just to explain the horrible experience they had,.",1.4

We were attempting to buy a vehicle long distance after finding the exact one we wanted on AutoTrader.  We called and gave the information to Christopher Taylor for financing and waited and waited and waited-this was on a Saturday. He promised to call back by the end of the day and nothing. Over the next couple of days,  I sent at least 7 emails to different people and never got a response. I work in an area with no cell reception but I told Chris in at least 2 emails that I can respond to emails only. Finally we called today and spoke to Chris and surprise! He sold the truck on the same Saturday we had been discussing it. I guess we didn't merit even a call back. He said he ""thought we couldn't handle the payment"". Which is funny since he never got back to us with a payment or any financing options whatsoever. What a joke!

199,"July 30, 2014","Unfortunately there is not a negative star option.  We have traveled half way across the United States to purchase high dollar trucks before and never have we been subjected to the incompetence,  unprofessionalism, and pure lack of respect that we encountered at this dealership.  After much negotiation via email, they must not believe in using the telephone, we arrived at a deal.  After spending 10+ hours removing hitch! lights! and company logos, We proceeded to drive  1 1/2 hours to take delivery of the truck.  When we arrived we were brought to the vehicle which was exceptionally dirty and had not been detailed as promised.   Prior to our arrival the general manager,  Mike Wilson, had stated he was taking over the deal and would make sure everything was done properly.  Obviously he never looked at the vehicle as the detail work was not done.  We then left the dealership for approximately an hour and a half to go have dinner while they did the detail work.  Once we returned to the dealership we were able to inspect the vehicle and then found scratches on the tire rims (2) and on the front bumper in the paint.  This is a brand new 2014 Dodge 3500 very expensive  truck.  We were then told that the dealership would not repair the Defects in this brand-new vehicle as we were getting too good of a deal.  We then walked back outside to look at the truck again when the new car sales manager, Chris Meadows, came out to greet us.  He is the only individual at the dealership that showed professionalism.  Chris then assured us that he would put in writing that these defects would be repaired.  We proceeded to go back inside to sign the paperwork.   It was at this point that the general manager told us that he would not sell us the vehicle.    I will be going to a reputable dealership tomorrow to purchase a truck.

201,"December 20, 2013","My problems with this dealership started from the day I purchased my 2013 Dodge Challenger. I went in on a Sunday in March 2013 to purchase my car (after dealing with the online sales staff). The sales process was easy and I had no problems. They told me the vehicle I was buying was at a ""overflow lot"" that was closed on Sundays, but they would get the car first thing Monday morning, have it detailed and ready to go by lunch. I went to the dealership around 1p that Monday, to find that my car was on the lot, but had not been touched and was sitting waiting to be detailed. I was told that the car would be ready that afternoon for pick up. I finally get a call around 5:30p so say that the car would not be ready as there was a recall due to a faulty wire that could possibly make the engine catch on fire (why I was not told this when making my purchase is beyond me). I was told they were getting the parts in the next day and mine would be one of the first to get fixed. Over the course of the next 11 days, I was continuously told that my car would be ready the next day. Finally, on the 12th day I was called by the Service Manager and told that Chrysler had let them know that the cars that were brought in from the recall would have to be fixed first since they were already being driven and that he was receiving more parts the next day and my car was on the list to get fixed. Amazingly I was called the next day (day 13) to pick up my car. When I arrived at the dealership to get my car, there were 2 deep scratches on the front on the car about 4"" long each. I asked why this was not taken care of before I was called to get my car and was told that the body shop would have to do the work but there were backed up until the next Wednesday. I could drive my car until then and then bring it back. So I did just this and brought it back on the Wednesday. I was told the car would be ready to pick up on that Friday. I call on Friday to check the status on when I would be able to pick up the car and was told that the paint still needed to dry and the car would not be ready to pick up until the following Monday as there were closed on Saturdays. Finally on the Monday, 3 full weeks since the time I purchased the car and many lies later I was able to pick up my car. 

Fast forward to September 2013 as I bring my vehicle in for service due to a clicking noise coming from the driver side front tire (20"" chrome clad Challenger Wheels) and the check engine light on after just 2K miles. I dropped my car off on a Saturday and was told by my Service Adviser it would not be able to be looked at until the following Monday. I was called on Monday and told that they were able to hear the clicking noise from the tire and one would be ordered to replace it and it would be in on Tuesday. On Tuesday I was called by my Service Adviser and was told that he ordered the wrong size wheel (18"" instead of the 20"" that was on my car) and that he would have to order the right size and would need it for another day. That evening I get a call again to let me know that the 20"" wheel was on back order due to a large number of vehicles having this problem. I asked him if he was just able to switch the wheel out with one of the several other Challengers they had on the lot and he said they could not do that. He told me I could pick the car up on Wednesday and would be called when the part came in. I picked up my car and was told that the check engine light was due to the gas cap and that it had been tightened and the light reset and that the wheel was ordered (which to this day the check engine light comes for about 75 miles after each time I get gas). Over the course of the next 2 months I would call to check the status of my wheel and each time was told they expected the part in that week and would call me. I dropped my car off to have the oil changed and tires rotated at the 2 month mark from when I originally brought the car in and was told again that they expected the part that week. I asked my service guy what the end game would be if the wheel did not come back into stock soon and he just smiled and went on with his day. Over the next month I did not follow up to see if they were going to call me at all to update and of course I received 0 phone calls. Finally, 2 days before the 3 month mark, December 17, 2013 I called my service adviser and left him a message that I had been patient in the process but that time had come to an end and wanted my vehicle fixed and if I did not hear back from him I would pursue other avenues to alleviate the problem. I get a call back about 10 minutes later letting me know that he would pull the ticket and find out the status and call me back that day. Of course, no call back came. I called the next morning, December 18, 2013 and spoke to the Service Director. I told him my situation and he said he would call me back within 30 minutes with an update. Surprisingly, I did get a call back and was told that the part was in and when could I drop the car off? I told him I would drop it off the next morning, December 19, 2013 at 9:30a. He told them that would be fine and to ask for him when I arrived. The next morning, December 19, 2013 I show up at 9:30a to deliver my car and of course when I ask for the Service Director, he is not there but my Service Adviser was and had spoken to him about the situation. I told him that the Service Director had told me the part was in and he responded that he was pretty sure it was a 18"" wheel not the 20"" wheel that was in and he had told the Service Director that. I asked him what the possibility was of just having all 4 wheels replace with something different and was told me since its under warranty they cant switch out all 4 wheels (Huh?!, I find this hard to believe). None the less, I told him I would leave the car with him for the day and pick it up the following day, Friday December 20, 2013. I never received any call on Thursday December 19, 2013 in regards to the status and so far have called on December 20, 2013, 2 times for the Service Director (left a message), 1 time for the Service Manager and 1 time to the service department (whom told me he would find out the status and have a service adviser call me) and have yet to receive any call back. I will continue to try to make contact with the Service Department to try to finally get the problem solved (not holding my breath). 

Buyer Beware when purchasing from this dealership as anytime service is needed, you will be given the old ""cant replicate the problem"", mislead and told many lies as per the Car Salesman way. Hopefully if you've already bought from them you have better luck than me as everyone deserves to have a quality car to drive when spending so much this day in age. ",1.5

I am still being given the run around over a burnt out headlight bulb and hoses for windshield washer fluid like you wouldn't believe. My 90 days has not been up yet, when I called them to tell them I just discovered that my headlamp was not coming on on the front passenger side and the windshield washer fluid was not coming out, I was greeted with' ""bring it in and we will check it out"" it is a 30mins trip and I am down to one vehicle currently and have 2 small kids and a full time job. Anyway, went in on a Saturday and was told that they were too busy to look at the vehicle and to bring it in some other time. I called back and made an appointment to drop it off this past Monday. I didn't receive a call by 3pm so I called in and was told the car hadn't been looked at as yet and would be. I then was picked up via their shuttle at 5pm only to discover that nothing had been done and I had to wait for them to replace the bulb. The hose parts weren't there. I paid for everything to the tune of 216 and change and was told I would get a phone call the next day when the hoses were there and released at 5.23 to rush and pick my kids up from daycare at 6pm when they close. I made it a few minutes late. I waited for the phone call and it never came. I left work and called back at 4.30 and was told parts didn't come and to drop off my vehicle the next day to which I said I would rather get a phone call when the parts were there and then I would take it in. The customer no-service coordinator asked me what my phone number was! How was he going to call me when the parts were delivered? I have now called the Managing Director, Michael Wilson and had to leave a message. I am sooo frustrated and really disappointed.

205,"January 25, 2013","I bought my 08 Liberty from them back in June. The dealership was great and helped me get into a vehicle. The financing department is one of the best. I was thrilled at the amazing warranty ( lifetime powertrain, tires, dent protection, etc.)  I was being told about and how low the payments were even though I only had a $1000 to put down.  I thought wow what amazing work they did because my credit wasn't that great.
So the airbag light came on. I take it to the dealership to have them look at it and change my oil because I'm already there might as well kill two birds with one stone.

The response I received was: It is not covered under your warranty. It was going to cost me right under $110 to have them LOOK at the light and if it needed fixing they would deduct that from the repair bill.
I was so taken aback. The truck was 6 months old and they were going to charge me for looking at a light? 
I was disappointed they turned out to be like that. My airbag light goes off and dings every time I hit a bump. I am so afraid that the airbag is going to come out on me while I am driving and make me wreck this truck, but they didn't seem to care that they sold me a vehicle that was now a safety issue. I guess when something bad happens they wont have any problems coming after me for the money I owe for the truck even if the truck they sold me caused the problem. 
To sum it up I walked out of the dealership and called my husband and told him the situation. We had been saving the money to put a down payment on a car for him at that dealership since they had worked so well with us before. Needless to say I didn't get my oil changed and I sure will NOT buy another vehicle from this place.",2.2

207,"July 14, 2012","I had always been told and from experience in the past had known that dealers were ridiculously priced for parts. My past experience confirmed this and the customer experiences were often unpleasant. They were unpleasant because the parts employees were often gruff and unknowledgeable. My most recent experience was a 180. My vehicle was stuck on a rack and I could not locate a part from a salvage yard and I dreaded going to the dealer. To my surprise, the part was much more than it would have been at the junkyard, Kent was incredibly professional/friendly/knowledgeable, and he made sure I got my part the very next day on order. The dealer has gone above and beyond to ensure a great customer service with reasonably priced parts and great customer service. In my book, that deserves recognition.

We had issues with our Turbo for four mounts causing us to not be able to drive over 25-30 MPH on the highway and basically live in rental cars. Our previous dealership, South Pount Dodge, was not only unaccomodatiing, they didnt value our business nor could they remember our names after we had been customes of theirs for four years!

The lady answered and told me they had just gotten to my car and would know within the hour. So I waited that hour, and nothing. I waited another hour and finally decided to call them again. No one answered! Finally 5:30 rolls around and they return my phone call telling me they found what was wrong. A coolant housing leak to which I was going to need replaced. It was gonna be $600. She told me she understood if I needed to think about it because it was a large sum of cash and said I could leave my car there over night(how sweet right?) But it was probably because it was now 20 minutes until closing time. I told them I'd pick it up first thing in the morning and I did just that. Once she was showing me paper work to check out she told me they didn't even change my oil, which is the main reason I went in there. Paid $99 to get them to diagnose my car and went else where. That $600 job they were gonna charge me for I got done for $300 right down the road. ",1.8
