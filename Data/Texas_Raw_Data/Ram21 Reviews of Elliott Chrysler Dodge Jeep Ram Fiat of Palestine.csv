2,"June 05, 2020","Elliott's of Palestine is by far the best vehicle dealership I have ever done business with. All of the staff is pleasant and respectful. Juan Servin was the sales rep I had the pleasure of working with. He found the exact vehicle I wanted. He understood my time was precious and didn't even try to waste it. There was no pressure, no hard sales, no haggling. Just straight up, get the job done service. I appreciate all the members of the Elliott team I dealt with and can't thank each and every one of them enough. But definitely ask for Juan when you go in. He's awesome. ",5.0

15,"September 10, 2019","We shopped at 50 different car dealers online for a 2018 Toyota Highlander.  All of them were playing games on my trade in and price of the car.  And Palestine Elliot Group gave the best trade in up front.  No negotiation was required.  Over all, I financed $4500 less with Elliott with my finance amd purchasing of this vehicle.  The customer service is great and well worth your time.
