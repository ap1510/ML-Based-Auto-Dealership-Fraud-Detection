5,"October 25, 2019","I need a Ram 3500 Heavy Duty and I was able to locate it in El Paso. At first I was a little hesitant to drive out there to buy, but I was taken care right from the start and it made me feel comfortable. Both Edgar and Samuel were awesome, nice guys and very knowledgeable. They knew I was coming from another State and made sure all my questions were asked and that everything would be ready for me and my arrival to sign and drive away! It was a very welcoming place and I would go back to buy again. Thank you guys at Dick Poe Dodge!",5.0
6,"October 22, 2019","It was a great buying experience. Adrian the salesman was able to answer all my questions, never felt lost or overwhelmed. He took care of me from the beginning, showing me the vehicles, arranging the test drive, successfully going through the financial portion with me and then present my new car to me. 
The staff was also really helpful. 
I can definitely recommend Dick Poe Dodge Ram!! ",4.8

9,"July 26, 2019",I was very pleased with the customer service and friendliness all of staff at Dick Poe Dodge. My dealer Mr Edgar Porras was by far the best dealer I‚Äôve ever encountered when purchasing a new vehicle. His willingness to work with me so I could get the vehicle that I always wanted with affordable monthly payments was outstanding. I would definitely recommend him to anyone who‚Äôs looking to buy a vehicle.,5.0
10,"July 11, 2019","I would highly recommend not just this dealership but specifically Mrs. Tanya Sanchez!  We just purchased our second vehicle from her in 3 years and the experience is always personal and professional.  She truly cares about her customers and will go to extended lengths to make sure the customer gets exactly what they are looking for.  If you are in the market for a new vehicle, go and ask for Tanya.  I have been replacing our cars with new ones for the past 14 years where ever the Army moves us and she is by far the best and most compassionate sales person I have encountered.  She was even able to convince me to change from my F-150 (that I loved) to a new Ram, only because she asked my wife and I all the right questions and got to know our personal family needs and made a recommendation, not on cost or sales, but on what was best for our family.  She is amazing and the team at Dick Poe Dodge will keep our business.",5.0
11,"June 24, 2019","Edward Favela and John Atel worked with me every step of the way, which is not easy.  I go into places like this trying to test the people I am working with, not many things are more irritating than a salesman who gets commission just because he met you at the door that particular day.  Edward took it well and before long he was dropping the same kind of comments i was, which is refreshing.  Don't let political correctness rule your lives.  

O ordered a new Ram 3500, they followed it through the process, kept me updated, and the vehicle arrived on schedule as expected.  ",5.0

19,"April 24, 2019",WENT IN FOR AN ISSUE WITH THE AC TURNING OFF. THEY DIAGNOSED PROBLEM AND GOT IT FIXED IN LESS THAN THE TIME I WAS QUOTED. THEY HAD PARTS IN STOCK SO THAT WAS A PLUS TO GET MY CAR FIXED. ,5.0
20,"April 21, 2019","I was placed in a shuttle within a few minutes as opposed to close to an hour that has been the norm in the past. The service rep could still communicate better with the customer.  I understand that they have to talk to many customers in a day but basic information would be good. Estimate of work, even if it is no charge due to warranty or recall work. Estimated time of completion. etc. Dealerships are never good places to work in but the employees should not be disgruntled while dealing with customers. When they are, it tells me that there is a deep company dissatisfaction, which further tells me that the work might not be up to standards. The service tech was not disgruntled but did not communicate very much when I turned in my truck.  The lady that assigns the shuttle was not in a very good mood.  The driver of the shuttle was excellent.  He made the drive very interesting, he had many good life views and seemed the better ambassador for the company. The cashier lady was very neutral and didn't seem to be focused on her job.  It took her a few seconds to locate my key fob after handing me my paperwork.  The reduction in paperwork is a pleasant change. Perhaps you can go to emailing paperwork instead of printing the documents.  I usually scan and electronically store my documents, then I recycle the paperwork. You can have the customer sign on a signature pad to validate the work done and have that electronically placed on the paperwork so that when you email the document to the customer, it has a signature on it.",4.0

30,"January 05, 2019","For the past year and a half I have been working with Edward Favela on buying a new Ram 1500.  When I started the process, I did not know what I did not know.  Edward took his time to teach me about the characteristics and options available in each of the trim packages.  Through the process, I believe Edward fully understood what I wanted and did not try to sell me something I did not.  A successful transaction is when both parties walk away feeling like they got a good deal, and that is how I felt.  

Thank you to Edward Favela for your knowledge, patients and honesty.",5.0

33,"December 26, 2018","Jonathan was a great salesman.  He knew the product bumper to bumper and helped me find what I wanted and gave me a great price.  Generally, I hate buying cars from dealers because I hate the process of bartering that has become the norm in vehicle sales.  It wasn't like that at all with Jonathan.  I knew what the vehicle was worth going in and the first offer was more than fair.  It was a pleasant experience all around.",5.0
34,"December 23, 2018","Rick Lozano made the purchase of my new ""Ram 1500 Limited,""  the ""Greatest Purchase Experience"" ever! Ram Trucks speak for themselves, however, professional sales personnel like Rick created an environment for a one of a kind purchase experience. I never felt pressured at anytime and the entire process was extremely fast! Zandy Martinez was the icing on the cake (Very personal and courteous, but professional)!",5.0
35,"December 23, 2018","Mike Parra made this the best and fastest vehicle purchase I've ever had in my life. He showed me a few Ram trucks in the trim that I was looking for. I saw two trucks that I liked the best. I was able to come back later in the same day with my wife to do a side-by-side comparison of the trucks to decide which one I wanted. Once the decision was made, the offer was given to me. I phoned a friend that's in this business and was told that I was given a great offer. The deal was done. No BS! No Pressure! Just the Best Deal Ever! And even after the deal was done, Mike came back and put a few cherries on top as well. Thanks Mike!!",5.0

The process was very easy and so convenient, the vehicle I chose was in perfect condition and exactly what I was looking for.

46,"October 07, 2018","They sold me a void extended warranty. I bought a car from them June 2017 and 4 months later the engine went out with no prior warning. All of a sudden their customer service declined. They wouldn't return my calls and I would frequently watch Roger play on his phone and diddle around as I was waiting upwards of an hour just to get an update that there was no update. After over a month of paying for rental cars out of pocket they gave me a bogus diagnosis because they don't know much about boxer engines and they handed me a parts invoice for everything under the hood. Turns out when I took my car across the street to Subaru El Paso, the extended warranty adjustor came by and said that they would not cover the repair due to the aftermarket intake, which was on the car at the time of purchase. Why would they sell me a warranty that was automatically no good? I wouldn't have bought this car if they wouldn't have sold me the bad warranty and it would have saved me $10,000 for a complete engine rebuild and various repair costs. ",1.0

68,"April 26, 2017","Purchase a used truck.  After 4 hours to process sale I recommended to pick up the vehicle the next day.  Instead, the sales man urged me to take the vehicle home...and come back for my vehicle latter.  In the rush, and in doing so, I later (in the week) noticed no floor mats, no extra key, no jack /jack tools and the spare tire was flat.  When I attempted at first to obtain these basic items, I was initially told that I would have to pay half for the extra key...and provide a referral (someone interested in a car) in order to get the extra key.  After arguing the issue, I finally got a spare key and floor mats. I ordered the jack tools from Ebay still missing jack.  I was then able to remove the flat tire...took it for repair but was advised that the tire was not repairable (holes on the side of tire).  I had the tire removed and disposed of and asked Dick Poe if they would replace the tire.  Their answer was no...they wanted to see the tire.  When I asked for complaint department...they explained their was none.   Very disappointed and hope to speak with Richard Poe II.",1.5

She demonstrated true customer service and when I'm in the market for service or a new or used vehicle Dick Poe Dodge will be where I will buy from. Great job, thank you. ",5.0

88,"November 08, 2014","I have to say today Dick Poe Dodge proved to be the reputable dealership that they have been for the past 80 plus years. I have had a stumble in the past with service there and it really tore into me and I tore into the dealer on the reviews. I received a phone call today from Mr. Mailander and he maintained such a professional attitude and positive mind that I had to come back into the reviews and revoke what I have said. I apologize for the world to see to Dick Poe for tings said on the reviews, I was quite angry. Thank you to Mr. Boles, Mr. Recklebus, and Mr. Mailander you all truly are there to help. Thank you for paying for the damage that was accidentally caused on my vehicle and thank you for making things right thus far. I am an owner of a 2012 Ram 2500 Laramie Longhorn Mega Cab $67,000.00 and a 2013 Dodge Durango R/T AWD $53,000.00 (both bought new from Dick Poe Dodge)so I am a real customer with real concerns, real issues can happen to anyone and customer service goes a long way. Please Dick Poe Dodge and affiliates accept my apology. ",3.8
89,"January 26, 2014",I am normally not thr type of guy to take time to go out of my way to write a review but I was so impressed with the service team at Dick Poe Dodge I felt like they deserved it.   I have bought a couple of cars here but never really used the service much until now.  I always assumed I would have to pay a lot because it is a dealersip.  I was very pleasantly surprised at how informed and helpful the staff was and how affordable my brake job was.  They have earned another loyal customer.,5.0

To make a long story short, Fernie a service advisor was told what my van was being brought in for and he took it upon hhimself to approve a little over $400 in service.  He then lied to the service manager Rusell who had the audacity of rolling his eyes while we had our little pow wow at their service station.  I ended up paying half the cost but will NEVER take my vehicle back to them nor will I purchase Any other car from them.  They treat people with disrespect.

91,"May 06, 2013","I purchased two new vehicles here, one six months ago, a dodge ram, paid cash for the whole thing, then last week we traded in our reliable but hi mileage charger for an rt Durango. Drive through the car wash and it starts raining inside the car! Not even 1000 nmiles yet, so we turn it in for service, then they didn't call us even after the salesman said he would have them call us. So we figure we will drive over and see what's wrong, well now my ram with less than 13000 miles won't start, click, click, click. Third time this has happened. So I finally get it started and on the way to the dealer the ad won't switch to the front vents, WTF! I can't believe this crap, I am a loyal dodge fan never owned anything else in the last 20 years I think the new mantra for Hemi should be Hemi! Works half the time I am pissed!",1.4
92,"February 12, 2013","This company and their associates will put you through the wringer, and not be completely honest about anything, to include the jacking up of the fees that they charge (which are not necessary fees, but they charge them anyway), and they will not do anything with any expedience unless it is to get themselves out of a bind. 

This is a company filled with associates that cannot be trusted, and their business practices are severely lacking. Customers are not treated with dignity and respect if there is an issue, when reporting issues the customer is dismissed and treated with very poor mannerisms unbecoming of any business. 

I will never again conduct business with Dick Poe Dodge or any Dick Poe dealership in the area. My business referrals will be going to other dealerships who treat their customers with courtesy, respect and will not try to rip them off for their hard earned paychecks. ",1.5
93,"November 06, 2012","Purchased a new vehicle in July of 2012, after three months we still do not have the tag or documentation needed for our bank (they are the lein holder), our insurance company and the tag office at our home of record. We have contacted the dealer constantly to get them to fix the problem, and they have not done so. They claim to have been given wrong information, but yet they have copies of driver's licenses and the like proving the information provided to be valid and true. They have also been exceedingly rude when they've been contacted regarding this issue. Rather than fixing the issue, they are only defensive of the one employee, Mary, who deals with the tag/title documenation, claiming she's done this ""for over 20 years"". Obviously not if the documentation was sent to the wrong place, even with recorded information, and live information saying to send documentation to ""county of residence"". 

The documention (all originals from what we have been told) were not sent to the tag office as they should have been, and they were in fact informed of such when dialing the number to the state department of revenue (this is a recording that states all vehicle tag/title documentation is to go to the county of residence, not the Department of Revenue). 

I am set to go into a combat zone soon, and they are still sitting on their thumbs claiming no wrong doing... and they have the full payment for the vehicle already... that has been verified through our bank, and we owe Dick Poe nothing... we now owe only our bank. 

If you want a good first new vehicle buyer experience and for things to be done appropriately... stay away from Dick Poe Dodge or any of the Dick Poe dealerships in the El Paso area... This dealer has made a first time new car buying experience a living nightmare to say the least. And as of this morning, there has still been no remedy, and time is running short before I am in a combat zone. 

Save yourself time, worry and hassle... go to any other dealership in the area if you want your sales contract honored, and if you value professionalism in those you do business with. We will never shop at this dealership again, and would no longer recommend them to anyone. ",2.8

March 5 2012 I purchased a used 2007 Hyundai Santa Fe from Dick Poe Dodge.  The same day I signed the loan documents, they kept the vechicle to detail it (clean inside and out plus the air bag light was on).  They kept the car longer than I was told, the gave me a loaner, a van.  Finally after many many calls, I was told the car was ready at 7 pm which they close at 8 pm.  I went to pick it up, as soon as we go in the car I noticed the air bag light was on still.  And the cleaning job was horrible.  Not even that once home inside our garage, I noticed there was a dent in the back and one in the front.  Plus it smelled of gasoline.  When I called the salesman, Mr Martinez, I was told to drop it off again, and he would have it looked at.  Upon arriving we went to the service dept where we were meet by ""Pauly"" where he reassured me things would be fixed along with the salesman.  I later on called the General Manager and explained to him what was going on.  I told him about the dents and the mirror on the driver side.  I was told by Mr Martinez that they would replace the fender and mirror.  I went 28 March 2012 to pick up my car after many, many calls to Mr Martinez.  Only to find out that the mirror is on order, they didnt replace the fender, like he thought, they were still scratches.  I was told many times Mr Martinez that I purchased a USED auto not a new one.  I also called Mr Milander, and explained about the auto again.  I was also told by him that it is a used auto I should expect it not to be perfect.  I am retired military.  There main business is military retired and active duty.  I regret purcahsing from dodge.  I have boughten several used autos in my lifetime on my own, never have I had any difficulities.  

At this point I have no intentions of purchasing any vechicles from them.

99,"February 03, 2009","Where do I start. My vehicle ( 2008 Dodge Charger ) has spent 41 days total in the shop for warranty repairs that turned into service and body shop damage. The paint was falling off the doors. I took my car in to have the paint repaired. It has been back in the shop 3 separate times just to have the swirl marks taken out of the paint. Each time a "" secret product "" has been applied over the swirl marks to make it appears as though the repair has been made good. When the vehicle is washed the swirl marks come back into plain view. The body shop damaged 2 door panels and reinstalled the damaged door panels. The body shop wet sanded the door jam area on the passenger side. Left a lump of body glaze un-sanded. They painted over the flaw. No clear coat was applied. They then painted clear over flaw after another visit. When I dropped the vehicle off for the paint repair the first time I waited 4 hours on a work day for a rental vehicle. They ended up giving me a loaner dodge magnum ( do not buy this car with the basic engine you will get killed on the highway ). Needless to say the paint repair is still not finished.
