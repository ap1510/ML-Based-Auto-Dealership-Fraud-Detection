Thank you for the great service. The sales rep that helped me was Alan Thomas, who did an excellent job! He went out of his way to help me find the truck (2020 Silverado Z71) I wanted. In the end, my decision was not to buy a truck at the moment. He gave me a great deal, but thought it was not wise to buy a vehicle during the tough times (coronavirus) we are going through. He was very classy and respectful about my decision. In the future when ready to buy , I’ll definitely come back....thanks Alan!

1,"March 17, 2020","If I could give a 0 I would without a doubt. After speaking with a salesman multiple times about a corvette they have on the lot, looking at all of the pictures they had taken of the car and reviewing a video the salesman sent me of the car in question, I decided to jump in the car for a 2 hr. ride and go pick up the car. I finally made it to the dealership and that is where things went downhill SUPER quick.  When I got there, they said they were having an issue with getting it started because the battery was dead.  I said, no problem as they were going to install a brand new battery for me.  Finally they brought the car around ... the first thing I noticed is that they didn't even bother to wash the car even though they knew I was coming to pick it up.  But that was the least of my worries.  I go to the driver door to open it up and there is a chunk about the size of a penny broken out of the fiberglass on the door covered up by paint right by the handle.  My buddy who was with me told me to come around to the other side .... wow ... a super deep key mark from the back fender all the way to the front quarter.  I then noticed that neither the drivers window or the passenger window went full up after closing the door.  The tint on the windows was bubbled, cracked and just falling off.  Both of the visors were busted and the mirror fell in my lap when I went to open it up.  The telescopic wheel would not go in or out.  To top it off, I then got out of the car and did another walk around.  The front bumper was a completely different shade of yellow.  To say I was pissed and disappointed was an understatement ... especially after the salesman stated numerous times that the car was in excellent condition.

At the end of the day, this right here is why you need to inspect everything yourself before purchasing.  

Did I mention they actually RAISED the price another $1000 on the car after I looked at it and did ZERO repairs to it.",1.0
2,"November 12, 2019",Ruben was simply amaiNg! He worked very hard with my husband and I to find the perfect Tahoe for our family! Thank you so much! We had a lot of obstacles and he stuck by our side the entire way! We have been looking since July of 2019 and finally found one November 2019! He never pressured us at any time but always sent us updates of Tahoe’s he had found for us!! ,5.0

4,"December 22, 2018","We went in to Cavender Chevrolet today to look into upgrading to a Silverado Z71 for my husband. Not only was Brady amazingly helpful and informative, he was an all around nice guy! A huge shout out to Cavender for understanding that your team members will make or break you and for having Brady, Corey, John, and Charles on board to help make this an amazing early Christmas experience for us...my husband could not be any happier! Thank you all!",5.0
5,"September 25, 2018","Damage (1 inch in diameter, chip/ crack, previously filled with resin) on windshield was covered with a big price tag at all time.  The price tag was removed only after the finance transition was completed.  Cavender Chevrolet Preowned  Manager deceitfully withheld information affecting the desirability of value of a vehicle to obtain a financial advantage.  ",1.0

7,"February 21, 2018","Have been to this dealer several times for service and every time something goes wrong Here are a few examples: - went in for window tint quote and was sent away due to how busy they were and was told I would receive a call. Never received a call. - went in for inspection and then to tax office, after long wait at tax office was told that the inspection was not complete and asked to drive back to the dealer to correct. Vin keyed in incorrectly. - recently back for rattle in dash and told that the leveling kit installed on truck at time of purchase had been over leveled and need to be adjusted to avoid further damage to tires etc. This blew my mind when they tried to charge me for alignment after correction was made WOW! Now that adjustments have been made truck sits at stock height putting me out $500 for leveling kit I had them install at time of purchase. I have emailed Cavender with my concerns and to no surprise they have not responded!",1.0
8,"August 26, 2017","After leaving dealership's service department, reported engine light still on for transmission. Advised to continue on that it was repaired and probably just forgot to reset the code.   Transmission blew up then, with investigation discovering that Cavender had replaced the transmission filter and no transmission oil was getting through....causing the transmission to overheat and burn up ... altogether with towing etc costs approx $4000.00.  Made numerous attempts to discuss with Cavender but they would not discuss so had a Transmission specialist in San Antonio take care of replacing.  Could not just leave truck sitting there any longer for Cavender to answer our calls.  The Transmission expert even called Cavender Service Manager to try and discuss their error and show them the damage before he began replacement but they would not even talk to him.   I believe they thought it would just go away if they ignored me long enough.  I tried to be nice, respectful, interested in their own prognosis but No Response.  They had ample opportunity and I even kept low key...bringing a complaint only to BBB where they tried to deny fault saying the technician is no longer with them ... so we could not question his procedures and Cavender suggested they would pay $1500.00 to fix their error if  I wouldn't tell anyone about it basically.  I wanted full re-imbursement.    I could not find a place on their website where consumers could write honest reviews....therefore am now in search of all such places in order to inform the public about their service department.  We'd used Cavender for years as well as all our family and have always been able to get down to the problems at hand with any vehicle.  We heard that employees had apparently been leaving the service dept left and right and a great deal of dissatisfaction-costly errors made because the policies changed to PUSH THE VEHICLES OUT, not fix them....and their attitude has been ""mums the word"" to the consumer.  I would like to see the old guard ""honesty"" and ""customer service"" back in place....and truly a SERVICE department.  We are Chevrolet to the bone and it is disparaging to be ""HANDLED"" in this fashion....  I'd say go on up the road to have your vehicles serviced by experienced technicians that listen when there is an issue..not just try to up sale you on some pckge service item.",1.4
9,"March 12, 2013","My wife and I left the house one morning to go vehicle shopping thinking we were probably going to end up in at least a ten year old vehicle with high mileage. We stopped into Cavender just to look around and see what they had, but in the back of our minds we were thinking we'd never get into anything they had to offer due to limited credit. The entire staff proved us wrong that day. We left that day in a 2012 Chevy Traverse with very low mileage, and it was all thanks to the staff fighting to get us financed for the vehicle we wanted. We can't thank them enough, and we'll be buying all of our vehicles there from now on.

10,"February 08, 2013",The Service Department at Cavender is absolutely FIRST RATE... I have several Chevrolet Products including twol late model Corvettes and have been extremely pleased with the Service Dept.  The Sales Dept is another story though. I have tried to buy cars here and was totally turned off.  I won't use them to buy a car ever!  Snobby and arrogant....,5.0
11,"January 12, 2012",I'm a true believer in excellent customer service-I am in the sales industry myself-and so I know how competitive it is out their. We made this dealer our 1st choice to visit and the drive took longer than the visit itself-from the moment we got off our car to meet with a salesman-we had no salesman in mind-we were assisted with a person whom we didnt have a name of-never shook our hand and when we asked what type of vehicle we were looking for he simply pointed to the direction of the vehicles-after looking a little we asked to see 2 vehicles so then he went to get the keys-still not knowing his name or him knowing ours-the 1st vehicle we looked at wouldnt start-so he called a mechanic to jump start it-we proceeded to see the 2nd vehicle took a test drive by then we got a handshake and introduced ourselves and thats because my husband initiated the handshake-after test driving the vehicle we went into his office to negotiate-we negotiated 2 times and got turned down and left with no vehicle-very disappointed with this treatment-we were pre-approved by our bank and even had a buyers check in hand-sad to see that this dealer made no deal-I hope this review will be a lesson to be learned from not just the dealer but for the consumer as well.,1.0
