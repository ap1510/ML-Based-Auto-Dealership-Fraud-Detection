0,"May 18, 2020",I was very dis-appointed to wait for 30 minutes for a scheduled service appointment. I made an appointment online and was sent two or three reminders about my appointment. I arrived about five minutes early. My vehicle was finally taken 30 minutes later. While I waited I read the fine print about the appointment and found out that the appointment is only for speaking to the service person. I do not think this is any way to operate a business.,3.8

I usually go to one of the drive thru places, but after sitting in line for 45 minutes at my usual place and seeing only one car serviced during that time I went looking for another place.  I drove by the local Ford place and figured what the xxxx, I stop in and make an appointment for next week.   To my surprise even though the service bays were full, the service manager told me he could have it done 45 minutes tops.  I said fine, fully expecting to wait in the lounge for an hour or more.  He was back in about 30 minutes and said my truck was ready.. they had checked the tires, battery, brakes and other stuff and said everything was ok.

62,"May 02, 2019","I’ve been taking my family’s vehicles in to Tipton Ford for routine service for the past 9 years, and have bought one car from then during that time.  Thankfully I’ve had good luck with all of our cars and have never needed anything other than minor maintenance and repairs, but they’ve always done quality work in a timely manner on all of our cars and trucks.  There have been a few times when one of our vehicles has been in for routine maintenance and their service technician has found additional maintenance issues that need addressing. In these instances they have always called to inform me of their findings, recommendations, and expected repair costs before going any further.  I’ve always appreciated this as it gives me a chance to make a decision on what I want done to our vehicles, instead of just showing up to pick up our cars from the shop and getting billed for a bunch of additional services that I didn’t know about or ask for.  One of Tipton’s service representatives, Robert C., knows me by name and has been a great help every time I’ve come in.

My wife picked the car up after she got off work and I stopped by to sign papers after I got off.  They even found a better interest rate than my credit union gave me.

I'd definitely recommend Tipton to others looking for a new car. ",4.8

109,"August 20, 2018","My 2014 Ford Explorer SUV recently had a problem with the Air Conditioning Unit.  Robert Collier, Service Advisor for Tipton Ford, sat in the car with me to experience what I had explained to him, and immediately felt that there was a leak in the Air Conditioner.  Warm air was coming out instead of cool. We also heard an unusual noise when the air conditioner was on.  Mr. Collier asked if I could leave the SUV with him for further inspection.
The next day Mr. Collier called to let me know what the problem was and the estimate to repair it. My husband and I have purchased all our vehicles from Tipton Ford, and have appreciated their service and quality of work.  Since I am now a widow, I continue to use Tipton Ford as I know they will continue to take good care of my car and me.  Mr. Collier was kind and caring and I trust Tipton Ford to always do their best for me.  Great Customer Service and Quality Outstanding Work.

110,"August 14, 2018","It is my biggest pet peave to shop for a car and the salespersons have to Google the info while standing in front of the customer to figure out the answers that I ask. This was not the case with Tipton Ford and Joe Dickerson. He knew his specs without having to Google it. If he didnt know the answer he knew exactly who to go to, to get it answered for me right then and there. I have always had a great experience with purchasing vehicles from Tipton Ford.",4.8

120,"March 22, 2012","Purchased a 2011 Mustang and brought it in for service after 10 months of driving because of engin noise. Service manager told it need a new engin because it had spun a rod bearing. Had a very difficult time getting this approved under a warranted repair. Ford did finally agree to replace the engin under the warranty. Now dealership is unable to locate a suitable replacement engin and/or parts, dealership is pointing the finger at Ford saying its their fault they have not been able to get the parts they need to fix my car. Called Ford customer care and they are pointing the finger at another division of Ford for the issue. Not getting any help from anyone, would not recommend a Ford or this dealership to anyone. Vehicle has been at dealership since 01/09/2012.",1.7
121,"June 20, 2008","When there with a what I thought wase a transmission problem, it turned out not to be a problem at all. It must have been a fuel filter problem, but Excel Lub had had changed it the day before my appointment. Which took 3 days to get. The Tipton Ford is over a hours drive and they said to being it in eary, so my wife and I drove to Nacogdoches the evening before and stayed at a local hotel. We took the truck in at 7:15 AM and someone signed me in and told them to check the transmission, adjust the shifting linkage, and make a new key and call me when they checked the transmission  and let me know something. First off let me say they (Dan) never called me. At 10:15 AM I called him and he said the transmission guy was looking at it and he would call and let me know something, 11:15 AM I called back and he was gone to lunch, 1:15 I called and the guy was not thourgh checking it out. 1:50 PM which was check out time at the hotel I called for a ride back to the service center. When I got back Dan, said we could not find a problem with the transmission, (Great), and we are still trying to make a key, Third try, and the linkage needs a $169.00 part that they can get by tomorrow, but it would be the next week before they could get me back in to put the part on. At about 4:00 PM I had my truck back after paying $149.00 bill. That was for checking out the transmission and one key. The next day the (check engine soon) light came on and I checked it out myself and found a hose cut on the ERG system. I hope and pray it was not done on purpose and it just split on its on. I am writting this in case it happens to other folks that trust this guys. In the passed I have had good service from these folks. But, they failed me this time.
