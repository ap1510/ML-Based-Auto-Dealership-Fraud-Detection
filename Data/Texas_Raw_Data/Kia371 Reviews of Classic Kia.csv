6,"December 11, 2018","I went by with just the idea of test driving the Sorento to see if I liked it. Jerrah Pree came over and we talked. I told her I wanted to test drive one but wasn't buying today. (Famous last words) I had researched on the internet the vehicle and I was interested also in the Pathfinder and Pilot. I was impressed with the vehicle and Jerrah. She was friendly, firm but not pushy. After going over the vehicle and test drive, I asked her for some numbers. As I said, I had researched this vehicle so I had some idea of what I could get it for. Still not planning on buying that day. They came back meeting what I had said in my mind I could do. They did not mention it, but I know prices would go up after the first of the year so they made a sell by being what I feel is honest with me. Thanks Larry
P.S. I had also contacted Tyler by internet a few weeks earlier to see if the vehicle was still there. He replied quickly and sent pictures. Though the window sticker download still won't work on my Android phone nor tablet.",4.7

But as I was driving home I noticed that at faster speeds my car had a very bad vibration. They had not put my tired back on correctly and it was out of balance. I called them and they told me to bring it back in. Which means I would have to take off work again. Which if they would had fixed it correctly the first time there would not been any problems.

119,"August 23, 2018","I carried my 2012 Kia to have a recall motor installed, mind you I had drove this car on a trailer to have a local mechanic replace the engine. I looked around to see price range on a replacement motor so I didn't get burned, around 2000$ for a long block. So the car makes it there and they tell me it's going to be december before they can get a a motor. I had borrowed a friend's vehicle for the time being. After a week went by I made reservations for a rental car. That same day a guy from corporate called and said they would have one sooner. The day I pick up the rental car they told me they had the motor in and just needed a battery. Driving 3 hours one way to pick up the rental car I was in no position to get a battery to them so I had to buy there's for 200 dollars. Two days go by they call me and tell me my M.A.P. sensor(80$) is out, my altanator (100$), and my high pressure fuel pump (500$) and said that it would be around 2200$ (the same price as the block) I went to pick the car up in anger bc the car ran fine before. They send someone after the car and he returns and tells me the car is not in running condition. So I pay a 350$ tow back to my house and replace the parts for 850$ and 30 min of my time

My salesperson was Tyler Jester and he was by far the best salesperson ever.
Tyler was professional, knowledgeable, polite and his concern was making sure I got exactly what I wanted. He was a pleasure to deal with.
This was all done by email and every time I had a question he responded with an answer in just a few minutes, and I asked a lot of questions.
This back and forth went on for days before we closed the deal. My experience with Tyler was just amazing! This dealership is lucky to have such a professional young man working for them. My car was delivered to me (I live in Louisiana) and staying true to his professionalism Tyler called me that evening to make sure I received the car and to make sure everything was okay.  Can’t say enough good things about my experience and with Tyler.

I didn't know how much more I could take. I knew it would be at least 1500$ if not more. But I had no where else to go. I had to trust them. I had an extended warranty but I thought it would not cover the AC. When I arrived they were very kind. They thought they had fixed it by adding freon. It didn't work and they offered me a loaner car at no charge to me. On my way home I received a phone call from Waylon telling me it was the worst and would be 2000$ and something. I thought oh well time to pull out a credit card and go in debt. I thought they would try to sell me a new car. About 25 minutes later he called to tell me he checked to see if by chance I had gotten an extended warranty which I did. He said the AC wouldn't cost me a penny. How can I describe the relief I felt? It was a blessing. Thank you so much for not cheating me or pressuring me or just doing a regular job which would have been enough. No he went above and beyond by finding a way to help me. He has called to see if it is running well and it is. Thank you
