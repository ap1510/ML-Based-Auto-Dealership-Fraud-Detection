Rude, went from ""no cost, free"" to ""full cost, $250.""  Battery warranties are pro-rated and based on how long since Toyota installed them.  Bought 2 vehicles here, no more.",1.0

Scammers. Thieves. Liars. Don't EVER GO HERE FOR YOUR CAR MAINTENANCE! I ALMOST GOT SCREWED OVER BY FELIPE!

What kind of ethics do they not have?
Felipe Bibian, the service advisor tried to scam me out and lie to me that my tire alignment was off showing some technology that showed my car had some. Didn't even bother being nice or getting to know me, went straight for the sale and pushed into getting a throttle body intake service for my 2017 corolla. Showed me the pricing estimate and they were RIDICULOUSLY OVERPRICED!I've got sales experience and I knew right away something was fishy and fake.
Luckily I called my original place I take my car in for maintenance in baytown Toyota and the service advisor told me he used to work there and that this location would shove sales and unnecessary expenses down customers pockets and wallets for them to shell out. 

Food for thought: do your homework on how much maintenance should cost for your vehicle. Shop around and find someone that isn't lying to your face and be friend the dealership and stay loyal to them.",1.0

We went last year to Autonation Toyota in Pasadena to get a Nissan Pathfinder. We were happy with it until we started having the ""check engine"" light on. We had the vehicle for only a few days... We took it back to them and they told us that the vehicle needed a part and the part had to be order. It was ""free"" of charge since we had just purchase the vehicle. The vehicle was at the dealership for over 3 days. Keep in mind we had traded our car that was appraised for about 8k. So they let us use one of the vehicles they had available, while ours was getting fixed. Once we had our vehicle back the check engine light turned on again. Took it back to Auto Nation and they told me that they ""just forgot to reset"" the vehicle.... I was in and out within 15min. Well.... I went home, put a white towel underneath the vehicle and in the morning oil was everywhere! I took it back to the shop, told them I did NOT want the vehicle because it was having a lot of mechanical issues... This time they said they forgot to ""tighten the oil filter"". I said NO, I want my car back.... They said they had sold our vehicle but that they will try to get us another Pathfinder and in the meantime they would let us drive another vehicle while they find us another one. Took them about another week or 2 to be able to get us another one. Well after we finally got to see the new Pathfinder they noticed that the back door wouldn't lock and it would automatically open. They said it was ""just and electronic issue"". At that point it's been over a month and a half and we need a reliable vehicle and we didn't want to keep doing business with them. So the manager at the time Rick (which he is no longer working for them) was going to refund us our money. He did tell us it would take 4 to 6 weeks for them to get the title back and that they would payoff the loan and refund us for our vehicle trade in plus all the packages (which was about 6k in just add ons) we got at origination of the loan. Its about to be over 8 months and they are ignoring our calls and no one is taking ownership of the situation. We didn't get any money back from our trade in or the packages, and we also didn't get our car back. I will NEVER do any business with them. I wonder how they take accountability for this kind of transaction. How do they report this when it comes to the IRS? At this point my spouse and I have decided to proceed with legal action.",1.0
5,"July 15, 2018","Went there to return my leased 2015 Camry, and pick up a new one. I had a good sales man that spent good time explaining the features and we test drove the car. 

Keep in mind my 2015 camry was leased from this dearlership; when it was time to get the lease payment and price I asked the the salesman to check what would be the montly payment, he ask me to fill out a credit app, I told him that I will once I know what would be the price of the car and the payment amount. I am still shopping for a car and I can't fill out a credit app. at every dealerships, since it lower my credit score by getting hit with a hard inquiry on your credit report. I understand the payment depend on the score worthiness and I told him that my credit score is over 800 and if its not I understand if the payment amount changes.

The funny part start here.
His Genuis finance manager came back with these numbers
$445 monthly payment with $5000

$338 monthly payment with $7000
I got confused if i was leasing a Camery or Mercedes 
I thanked the sales person and I went to Mr.. Genuis and I asked him what the xxxx he was thinking? and if he really want to sell. 
He told me (It is the law that you have to fill out a credit app) not sure who told him about this law) I am sure not in Texas, second I am a repeated customer and they have all my info.
I left the dearlership and I went to Joe Meyers Toyota and I got a sweet deal. Never ever coming back to this dealership.

6,"October 31, 2017",We went to take a look at a 2015 Scion tC 9.0 Series which was the only car I was interested in..we talk about the deal and everything seems to go great. We sign papers and go on our way with the new car home. We go back the next day to pick up our spare key and they tell us to go into the finance office only to tell us that we cant keep the car and to return it. I understand banks kick back a deal but they let you take the car home and tell you everything is set and you're good to go. The reason my deal was kicked back was because $30.000 was too much for me to finance. 3 days later I bought a Charger RT at Gulfgate with 0 down and financed $38.000. I dont mind deals being kicked back but the fact that they let you take the car home and tell you to bring back the car is just sad. ,2.0

At 10:35 was told it's still driven test! Did not get the vehicle back unil 10:55. Oh, they left plastic cover and paper mat for me to clean up.

11,"August 03, 2014","The ONLY reason they got one star is because of Eric Clark. So thank him!! This was my first time buying a car in 2014 and they have scarred me for LIFE! This experience was horrible, sickening and everything else but good. After 2 months of driving my 2009 Malibu ltz the thermostat broke ..the horrible warranty they sold me (even when I asked for everything to be covered) didn't cover that.. I took it back to auto nation Toyota and they said since it was a Chevy they couldn't fix it and that I needed to take it to auto nation Chevy. The third month I need a new transmission. They sold me a faulty car and they KNOW it!!! Auto nation Chevy is just as bad! They have had my car for a week now and haven't called me to tell me anything! So I started calling auto nation Toyota because if I bought it from there they should've been able to help me . DONNA was Nasty and rude. She told me I needed to talk to Lee Cook. I asked her where was he and she replies well I can't see him from where I'm sitting. Lee never answered the phone and never returned my calls. Then they let me talk to a sorry manager. His response was if it's not covered then I can't help you...they don't want to help..  This place needs to be shutdown and DONNA needs to be the first to go and the ""manager"" following. I am gonna make sure; anybody so crosses my path will never buy from auto nation Toyota or auto nation Chevy. I am not DONE! ",1.4

13,"June 02, 2014","I am extremely pleased with the Service provided by Donna Terblanche in my search for a 2014 Toyota Sienna Limited.  AutoNation Toyota Gulf freeway actually returned my phone calls and was the first dealership to respond to questions. Throughout the process they were promptly engaged and committed to finding our family the car we wanted. 

Donna walked me through the sales process over the phone, she provided me the specifications of the vehicle I was interest in, and she provided me the lowest price offer.  Because of her I was able to save time and money.  I will definitely consider buying from this dealership for my future vehicle needs.

14,"January 28, 2014","I recently brought my car in for it's second Toyota Care service service period which consisted of an oil and filter change and a multi-point inspection of the car and engine. The oil and filter change were performed correctly but the multi-point inspection lacked attention to detail in checking the tire pressure including the spare tire. During the cold weather temperature condition Houston has experienced, caused the tire pressure light on the on the instrument panel to come on and remain on. I checked the tire pressure on each of the wheels and it was 29 psi. The spare tire was low in pressure and after repressurizing all five tires including the spare to the recommended pressure, the low tire pressure indicator on the instrumentent panel went off. While this service oversite was not serious and did not cause a problem for my car, it's an indicator of a lack of attention to detail. I recommend that during the winter cold months in Houston, all car tires including the spare tire be checked for proper inflation pressure.",4.2

17,"August 22, 2013","Fraud and dishonest Dealership --
Sold me three extended warranty program at the time of purchase. The verbal information provided by the Finance officer was incorrect and fell into the trap and spent close to $4500. 
Maintenance agreement - covers mechanical failures
Service Agreement - covers scheduled services
Appearance protection plan - covers exterior paint and interior 

Cancelled Maintenance plan within 30 days - Thought mechanical breakdowns are less likely on new cards and decided to cancel it. Promised full refund. Received $50 less because of some administrative fees not even mentioned during cancellation

Service agreement - Decided to use it. Dealership informed that the maintenance plan cancelled 30 days after purchase was meant to be covering services. The service agreement covers mechanical breakdowns. So this service agreement is of no use to me. As i cancelled wrong agreement in the first place due to wrong information provided by staff. 

I called dealership to cancel service agreement. Dealership rep informed about full refund and requested clean title received from lien holder. Emailed scanned copy of the clean title with clear mention of 1005 refund as discussed over the phone. Dealership staff replied okay and promised to process cancellation. 

I received refund check $709.10 less than expected 100% refund. I called dealership to inquire about the discrepancy. Dealership informed that all refunds are prorated. Spent few days over the phone with no use. I lost my $709.10 due to wrong information conveyed to me and my careless cancellation without documentary proofs.

Caution - please read your contracts carefully. Do not trust what dealership staff is telling about the warranties, vehicle. Please read all information personally, if you end of buying a car from this dealership. Spend some to read through contracts. 

I would recommend going to other dealerships around and have peace of mind on getting a honest deal. Honesty is very important when it comes to dealerships. A car buyer put trust into transaction and expects honesty in return. This dealership need to understand this. For a car buyer, this is very important transaction involving lot of money, time, and passion. Don't fall into sweet talks. Be diligent. Good Luck and take care.",1.0

20,"July 30, 2013"," I bought a 2012 Honda in March of '13. Now the car I bought only had 6,000 miles on it and we all know the reliability of Honda's so the car here is not my concern. What is of concern is my treatment after my purchase. I paid a ""fair"" price for my car. No one got a deal not me or them. I paid exactly what the car was worth, even though they acted like I got some amazing deal. They wouldn't even fill up the gas tank for me.  The dealer tags placed on my vehicle expired on 5/15/13. I never got my new plates in the mail. I waited, and waited and waited. I even began to search for them. I began to place the blame on the USPS with all the budget cut backs and such I became convinced that they had lost them. After three months someone suggested I contact the dealership to which I said ""what? No way would they have them it's been three months and they never called or emailed or tried to contact me in anyway. They're a dealership if they had them they would have gotten a hold of me or just mailed them to me."" But at a lose I emailed them. WTF!! they had been sitting at the receptionist for over three months. OVER THREE MONTHS!!!!! Without calling me or emailing me or even saying to themselves ""Maybe this guy needs his plate lets drop 'em in the mail for him."" I am flabbergasted  at the level of maturity from these people. The sales man blames the receptionist the receptionist blames the sales man no one would come out and take responsibility and even apologize. Sure everyone had a big smile on their faces when I bought the car but when I needed someone to stand up and say ""hey, I messed up. How can I make it right?"" Everyone was sitting on their hands. A smile only goes so far. I will never, ever recommend this dealership to anyone not even an enemy. They are the worst. ",2.4
21,"June 19, 2013","Well I recently took my 2008 Toyota Camry to get it serviced first for a broken brake light and then because my a/c started blowing hot air. In regards to my visit for the brake light I had made an appointment the day before my visit, came in the next day and still had to wait two hours! How long does it take to change out a light bulb? I hear a joke coming on lol. Later on I started having problems with the a/c, took it in immediately and was told that it would be almost two hundred dollars to get it checked! I felt this was priced way too high, but I was desperate considering it was a hundred degrees outside and I have two little girls who would be miserable riding around. They couldn't find the problem even though I again waited for two long hours. My service advisor told me that I would have to ride around for a day or two because the mechanics put blue dye in the car so that they would see exactly where the leak was coming from and that she would credit me back the price for the test when I got it repaired. So I was sent home with a tiny bit of freon that ran out immediatly and unfortunately happened over the weekend so I had to wait til Monday. I take it back in after looking for the same service advisor myself since hardly anyone comes out to greet you and ask if you need help. So she told me to wait and I did. After some time she came to me with the work order and showed me the price and what was going on. She told me there was a leak in the evaporator and I saw that it would cost me over fourteen-hundred dollars for parts and labor. I asked her how this could happen and she says that when the car starts aging things like this happen. The car is only four and half years old! So I guess it's true that once a warranty expires the car becomes a piece of junk. Well done Toyota! I told her I could'nt get it fixed at the moment for the obvious reason of a ridiculous price and was sent home with no extra freon and out two hundred bucks since I opted out of the repair. A couple days later I did some research on the cost of the actual part and it comes to no more than one-hundred and thirty dollars! Seems like they are making more money than should be allowed! I also saw another mechanic for his opinion and he saw no traces of the blue dye that the mechanics supposedly put in. He also was surprised that there was absolutely no air pressure when he checked my a/c. He told me this is highly unusual and that there should at least be a small amount of pressure  even if I have a leak somewhere. Well it's sad to say that I was not totally surprised when he told me this. Toyota will not be getting my business anymore!",2.4

During the purchasing and negotiating process I didn't feel the ""pushing"" to do things you don't want to which you feel at other dealerships or from other salespersons; Mike was very professional and we were able to reach an agreement in just a few minutes while talking about the different options I wanted to have in my vehicle.

34,"October 29, 2012","I have written a couple of reviews on Toyota dealerships in the Houston area. I do not know where these people writing these reviews are taking their vehicles, but it definitely is not Champion Toyota. 

My wife's vehicle was purchased there roughly a year ago (2008 Toyota Highlander) and with the purchase came a warranty that covers almost everything. What this review is about is their service, it is absolutely terrible. Sometimes when I call to make an appointment I will get either a happy greeting, or a ""yeah"" in a tone that I can only assume is someone having a really bad day. It's really up to a flip of a coin.

Service wise, they are very friendly people in person. That's where they are smart, they don't want to lose your business and lose out on some of your hard earned money. Dropping the vehicle off, I needed an oil change, tire rotation, and a couple of other things that I won't go in to detail about but they had the vehicle for about 8 hours.

Now me being the OCD type person to make sure I get what I pay for, I always put marks on my oil filter, drain plugs, and cabin filters just to make sure they aren't trying to get away from doing their job. 

I get a call later in the day that the vehicle is ready to be picked up. I head out, get dropped off and pick up the car and take it home to do my inspections. Now I pop open the hood and looked at the filter, of course the marks line up perfectly, the filter was never even touched. I don't even think they opened the hood at all, there is heavy dust build up where you grab the latch and the only hand prints there were mine. I scope out the bottom of the car, the drain plug is still in the same spot as well, and tires were not rotated (I make marks on the inside of them with a paint marker, FR, FL, RR, RL). Now given all that I was still not that upset until I started driving back to the dealer to complain, they used 1/2 tank of gas and drove only 12 miles which tells me they were sitting in the vehicle on a very hot Houston afternoon with the A/C cranked all the way up.

This wasn't my first visit there but since I paid for a warranty package which covers maintenance items I am going to make sure they do their jobs. I have since the last visit been there 2 more times, both times I call I get the same ""Yeah"" when someone picks up their phone. I am giving their friendliness and price both ""OK"" on this review, I got the warranty for a steal (for obvious reasons I suppose) and in person they are the nicest people you can talk to (also for obvious reasons). 

I will not and have never recommended this dealer for service.",2.0

47,"August 24, 2011","I went in to see if I could trade my vehicle in on a new 4runner, and they were super friendly and more than willing to work a deal with me.  I really am happy I choose this dealer out of all the dealers who contacted me.  Even after I took the 4runner home I still have friendly check up calls for my sales person David ""Texas Ranger"" Morrow.  He was very thorough and I drove home happy without any questions or concerns.",5.0
48,"August 23, 2011","This dealership was recommended to me, so I decided I would start here when I began my car search. I had a 12-year old car to trade in, which was only in fair condition, but I knew my price point and was looking for a certified pre-owned vehicle. I met with Donna, who was hilarious and really kind, and she made the entire sale process fun and less stressful. I went in on a Saturday, no car, no title, and clearly wasn't expecting to buy, but Donna showed me a car that I felt I couldn't pass up so I drove out of there in my new (to me) Toyota Corolla. That says a lot I think! 

I'm giving this dealership a top rating because they worked with me and my time constraints, were upfront about price points, and gave me a fair value for my trade in. The certified pre-owned cars also come with great warranties and I even received a year of free roadside assistance. Donna was also an excellent salesperson and gave me good advice. She talked about the numbers honestly and answered all of my questions, and her sense of humor helped! I will certainly recommend her to friends and family. 

While I can't speak about the new car buying experience, if you're looking for a certified pre-owned, this dealership has pretty good inventory and Donna is an excellent salesperson. You will feel like you're buying a new car and the dealership will clean everything up for you, too. Excellent service all around. ",5.0
49,"July 20, 2011",I came into Champion Toyota for an oil change. I was greeted by Jesse. He was pleasant and warm . Told him I needed an oil change. He listened and took care of me. I did not have to wait for a long time. A very pleasant experience .. Thanks Jesse.,4.6
50,"July 20, 2011","Cant say enough good things, it was a great deal and a great experience from start to finish.  We came to you on a glowing recommendation and they were right.  They listened to our needs found what we were looking for and moved fast to get us what we wanted.  In the end we got exactly what we were looking for at a great deal.  

Personal note, we went back in forth on the extended bumper to bumper warranty which I typically stay away from, in the end at the last second literally we put it back in the deal.  I have to say even though we have not had any problems with our car since we purchased it, I cant tell you how happy I am that we have it now, just knowing its there has given my great piece of mind, more than I thought, although they cost a bit, it was worth every penny based on how I feel now.  I expect if I ever have to use it I will personally come over and thank you again.  Strange that after an overall great experience, having this added to the deal at the last second turned out to one of the best parts.  One less burden on my mind in these tight times.

Again thanks for a great overall experience.

51,"April 29, 2011","Donna is the Internet Director at Champion Toyota. She responded to my internet request with the typical auto reply, but was one of the few to actually follow up soon after. When I arrived to look at the Highlander, she had it pulled from inventory, and had the keys on her person. It wasn't the typical car dealership where the salespeople have no authority, and the customer suffers and waits. The drive, etc, was pretty typical, but Donna was well prepared, knew details on the car that showed she had reviewed the Carfax, and service history of the Highlander.

When we decided this was a nice car that we would consider, we entered the dreaded ""negotiation zone"". Donna was very nice, and took all the pressure off. Her sales manager valued my trade very quickly, and came back first shot with a very fair offer. This is unheard of. Most used car managers try to steal the car from you,and put up a nasty fight before offering fair money. I considered the deal, and needed a little more money to be satisfied. her sales manager accepted, and that was that. Nice, courteous, fair, nothing like my previous car buying experiences.

By this time, it was about 9 pm. The Finance Manager greeted us shortly afterwards, and ran us through the typical process. I will say that Champion (autonation) has a very advanced way of offering warranties and other things. They have a computer that displays all your options, and is much more customer friendly than the typical experience. Its not a quick talking guy trying to sneak numbers past you. You see everything he is doing, and what costs what. Very cool.

I cannot recommend Donna enough. Wonderful person.",5.0

56,"January 21, 2011","CHAMPION TOYOTA CERTIFIED LIARS!
I purchased what I was led to believe by Champion Toyota's web page, and salesman John Nguyen what was a ""Certified Toyota Tacoma"".  What I actually received for the additional cost of a Certified vehicle was an ""AS-IS"" used truck.  
  After taking the vehicle to work the night after I bought it, my co-workers popped the hood and laughed when a latex mechanic's glove was tied around the oil filler tube instead of an oil cap.  After comparing the included Certified Toyota Inspection report with my vehicle, it became clear that this vehicle had not been ""Certified at all.  The vehicle failed to meet Toyota Certified Standards in numerous areas; seats stained, cigarette burn on door panel, valet key instead of required master key, large rock chip on windshield, alignment off, transmission shifting erratically, and suspension too soft.  To make matters worse, the finance department was just as bad.  I was offered a interior protection package at a reduced cost and was still not interested until the finance representative told my and I that the warranty covered rips, tears, cigarette burns, and stains, and that the interior would be replaced if it was ever damaged.  After agreeing to purchase the additional $400.00 dollar plan, I contacted the warranty company the following week to get clarification on the coverage.  They laughed at me when I told them what Champion Toyota told me was covered.  The plan actually covered nothing more than stain removal.

I contacted Mr. Nguyen and let him know my concerns.  Champion Toyota initially took interest in my problems, and the finance manager agreed to remove the interior warranty from my purchase price.  I was then contacted by the service manager, who said he would address all of the issues with my vehicle, and personally oversee another Certification Inspection.  I dropped the truck off and left it for three full days.  (I was never offered a rental vehicle).  When I picked up the truck three days later, the vehicle seemed to be in the condition it should have been sold to me in the first place.  However, after inspecting the vehicle further, it was apparent that the front bumper support was missing six fasteners and was held on only by the plastic bumper cover.  The alignment was also never addressed as the vehicle still pulled and the steering wheel was off still off center.  

Although I attempted to resolve this case of Deceptive Trade with the dealer, and Toyota Customer Service, the Sales Manager was unwilling to refund me any of the additional cost for the Certification that was never done.

I gave this dealership numerous chances to give me what I actually paid for, however they refused to compensate me for their obvious deception, and incompetence.
   I would not recommend this dealer to anyone that wants to ensure they are treated fairly, and honestly.  This dealer has sunk to a new low in a car buying experience.

57,"March 04, 2010","My wife & I purchased a 2011 Sienna from Champion Toyota on February 27th, 2010. Ryan Albritton (their Internet sales manager)worked with us for 2 months as the 2011 Sienna was starting to arrive at dealerships towards the end of February. I received quotes from another dealer through the Sams auto buying program. Ryan beat the best deal by over $500. He was very professional and all prices and promises made by him were honored exactly as negotiated. He obtained the exact model with the equipment we wanted and even made a repair to our 2005 Sienna at no cost to us and when we went to pick up the 2005 he had even detailed the entire car! If you are looking for a Toyota and want to be dealt with honestly and professionally I highly recommend contacting Ryal Albritton at Champion Toyota at their gulf freeway location in Houston.",5.0
58,"November 05, 2009","Pros: Well, buying the car was pretty smooth.  Good price.Cons: They wouldn't tell me my interest rate until after I spent hours there and was already signing all the paperwork.  They gave me an estimate on how much the interest rate would be and when I was signing the paper work I found out it was almost triple what they originally quoted me.  I decided to buy the car anyway cause I figured I can just get an independent loan later and pay it off.  Then, they gave me a ""We OWE"" sheet that said they would fix my mirrors.  I went to get it fixed, they said they need the paper.  I asked for a copy.  They told me they will call me one the parts come in.  I called them a bunch of times and went there a couple of times and they said they are still waiting on the parts.  A month later, I call them and talk to the parts department and some guy told me by mistake that they never ordered my parts.  They were not planning to fix it at all, they were just hoping I would forget.",2.8
59,"August 07, 2009","These people do not know what they are doing. Customer service is piss poor. Getting someone on the phone is impossible. Having them return a phone call is like pulling teeth. I will never deal with this dealership again. I hope you never have to either.

I wanted to pay for my car in full. I made a down payment and was told I would be able to pay off the balance through a transfer of funds from my account a couple of days later. The finance person was clueless about how I could set it up with my bank. He just hands me a piece a paper with an account # that he wrote down. Not very official documentation if I'd say so. 

While at my bank, my representative tells me they need more information. I contact the account manager of Champion's Toyota and she seems to not want to deal with me or the bank. The process took nearly 2 hours to settle. I thought that was going to be the end of it.

A couple of days later, the sales rep calls me wondering if I paid. He leaves me 2 messages. I call him and inform him of the transfer. He said he would check on it and call me back. No follow up. I called and left several messages. I called the finance rep. No follow up. I spoke to another finance rep. He said he would check on it and call me back. No follow up. These people suck.",1.0
60,"June 02, 2007","I went in to test drive a Corolla and wanted to know the ball park price. I was first asked to sign an ""entering into negotiations"" agreement. I did. But the numbers were not pleasant, this made me get up from the table. That act changed the attitude of the sales guy, he got serious and waved the agreement, telling me that I was bond to buy the car. 
I started laughing and walked away.

I knew not sign any papers, but justed wanted to see how pushy the dealership was. They are dishonest and try to sneak in the credit application without clearly stating the purpose.

So, go in test drive, but dont sign a damn thing. And remember you can always walk out and go some where else.",2.3
61,"April 02, 2007","If i could give a 0 score i would on overall experience.

When i arrived, no one came out to see what i was interested in.  I walked around for a little while, but then went inside to find someone that could answer my questions.

Samuel Guerrero was my ""sales consultant.""  We talked and looked at different Tacomas for a while and test drove a nice 4x4 model with the TRD edition.  The only complaint i have with Samuel is that when i asked to see a breakdown of what options it had, he changed the subject.

I didn't want to buy a car that day and was upfront with Samuel about that.  He asked me what price it would take to get the car out the door with me in it that day, i named a price and he said ""ok.""  But since i didn't want to buy a car and had told him, i still was uncomfortable with the deal.  I made that clear, but he still proceeded with the transaction.

Then, when i was on the phone with my car insurance company, i backed out of the deal and went home because i wanted to think about it.

(once again, when i showed up i said i didn't want to buy a vehicle that day)

Two days later, i went back after stopping by a nearby dealer.  The nearby dealer said he could beat the price on a 2007 instead of a 2006 which made me a little annoyed that they had said it was ""such a great deal.""  I assume the extra costs were associated with the ""options"" that Samuel had avoided telling me about.

So, when i showed up 2 days later... Samuel was with a customer and either didn't recognize me or gave me the cold shoulder at first.  Then i made eye contact with him and initiated the ""hello.""

He said he ""would be right with me.""  After a few minutes, i confronted him again and asked if i could just have a printout of the price we had agreed on the night before so i could think about it and also see if i could get a better price.  He said he'd work on it.  A few more minutes passed and i went outside with my (2) friends who had accompanied me this day.  We looked at the trucks a little bit and then a large African American male, who i was informed was the ""sales manager"" came out to talk to us.  The last time i was there he had talked to some other people and was very abrasive, pushy, and unprofessional.  When he came outside, he immediately started talking AT us.  I tried to respond a few times and he would have no part of that.

He said that we were very rude and my action was immoral asking for a written quote so i could ""go get it beaten by twelve dollars.""  I started to tell him that unless it was a sizeable difference, i'd stick with Samuel who had kept me there (some-what against my will) until 11:15 the night before.  But i couldn't get my sentence out before he cut me off.

He said that he heard i had stayed there until 11:15 acting like i was going to buy the truck and then just left.  I managed to tell him i was upfront about not having a desire to buy a truck that day, and he dismissed that comment and went back to insulting my integrity.

So, i left with my friends (who had walked away well before i, in disgust)

The time i was there before, he (rude sales manager) had sat down with a fairly timid and extremely polite family and proceeded to tell them that he couldn't get the color (i believe it was a camery) and that it was either take it or leave the deal that he was giving them that night.  He gave them ""12"" minutes to decide.  (maybe it was 10 minutes?)  And the guy just asked for a written quote so he could think about it.  HE LEFT ALSO (without buying a car)

The girl who was originally helping him told him that she was being pushy because less than 2% of people come back.  NO WONDER!  With horrible service like that and pushy sales people backed up by a rude and bully of a sales manager.",1.2
