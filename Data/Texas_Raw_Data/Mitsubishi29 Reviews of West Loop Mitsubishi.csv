He’s lazy , rude, and didn’t wanna give me a chance because my credit score isn’t exactly the best. This kid was only 25 yrs old maximum , I’m old enough to be his mother. I’ve never felt so offended EVER . He simply is not there to help. He didn’t even care to hear abt my trade in",1.0

5,"December 27, 2017","I am updating my original negative review. I will say that I had a negative experience when I first went in to buy my vehicle but this was quickly corrected by the sales manager, Rollin Collins. Mr. Collins called me the next day and wanted to see what he could do for me to make up for the original experience. I agreed to go in and see what could be done. He was friendly and professional and we worked out a deal I felt rectified the situation. Thank you Mr. Collins for reaching out and personally helping me purchase my new car. ",4.0
6,"July 28, 2017","I financed a Lancer in 2015 with this company and just recently i tried to finance a new vehicle. I went into the dealership and told them my price range and let them run my credit and so forth that night they said it was a done deal for me to take my car and come back the next day to sign the paper work because the finance director wasnt there. i was reluctant to take the car because it wasnt officially mine yet but they insisted i take it and leave my Lancer behind. So flash forward THREE weeks later almost a month and i STILL dont have the car financed even after i called and called and asked to speak with people i even went down there several times and they gave me a new temporary plate to keep driving the car which was a white Outlander sport that when i left the car lot had 7 miles and when i returned the car it had nearly 800 miles. By the third time i went back to sign my paper work they finally admitted it had taken so long because they had fired their one and only Finance director and they basically wanted to start my deal all over and they hadnt even started the deal in the first place. It was poor quality bussiness they didnt know how to handle the situation and they repeatedly lied to me the customer on several occasions. Who ever goes and finances the white outlander sport with 757 miles it is not brand new i drove it for almost a month, had my pets in the car, smoked e cigs in the car, had my friends after going to a concert in the car. Im sure they will clean it and make it seem brand new but again i drove it for almost a month. The car sales man name was Gabe And the Finance guy was Matt. Stay away from this dealership.",1.0
7,"June 27, 2017","Purchased a 2017 Outlander Sport. Msrp $19,500. Ticket price I was told was $25,895.00. Then when I signed was $33,000!!! Then was supposed to add satellite radio and tint. Was told can do it later that week. Then when that day came around, couldn't do it to following Thursday when I had to leave town that late afternoon. The service manager told me it would be done in the morning as far as the satellite radio and the tint would be early afternoon. Then the tint moved to three to 3:30 PM. I picked up my wife from work and went over there to wait. Then 4 o'clock rolls around and the manager tells me the tint guy still is not available yet he's running late. I told him I cannot wait and that I just needed to take my car so they gave me the keys left a whole bunch of garbage in my car didn't even wash it and didn't even show me how to use the satellite radio. The satellite radio wasn't even part of the regular radio it was an add-on that they stuck on my dashboard down low on an angle down so you can't even see it. then they told me there would be nothing added to the outside of my car but now there's a little box that stuck to the back of my car on the roof. They never show me how to operate it I still don't know how to operate it I'm still waiting for my tint.  I still don't have copies of the 15 different papers they had me sign. They wouldn't give me the owners manual until I get my license plates. And then a week after I got the car they told me oh the bank decided they didn't want to finance you and we had to go through another company and now your payments are going to be more. These people are the most corrupt non customer service  friendly people. I only went there because my friend is the salesman there but even at that I still got screwed. Go to another dealer do not waste your time going to West Loop Mitsubishi.",1.2
8,"May 01, 2017",The worst most unprofessional car lot I have ever been to.. we went in to either trade our car or just get a new one and keep the old as well. So the first day we were told that in order to get the car we were looking at we would have to keep the trade cause of the negative equity. Also we would have to cosine for the car with a $2250 down payment so we agreed and they assured us we had a deal so we gave them the payment. After that they advised us to take the car and come back another day so we didn't have to sit for hours waiting on all the paperwork so we agreed and set the appointment for the next week to finalize everything they told us it would only take one hour ... we come back a week later and no one had done anything so they picked up where we left off and 4 hours later they tell us we were approved but the bank wanted to trade but we couldn't get a deal with trade in.. kinda crazy to me but needless to say we weren't approved and got a refund (That I still haven't received) but can take a day or 2 to get back to my account..also we were stranded and had to get a uber home. So frustrating.. ,1.0
9,"March 17, 2017","3/13am saw car for 1st time.
3/13pm came back paid cash for car. 6 visits later still trying to get plates for car and was just told THE CAR WAS SOLD TO ME WITHOUT INSPECTION!!!  The Customer service is utterly atrocious.  I have patience of a saint and these incompetent people are on my LAST NERVE.  DON'T BUY FROM WEST LOOP MITSUBISHI ",1.4
10,"January 26, 2017","I had went to the dealership to see how they would treat me since I heard mixed reviews.  The experience was great.  Sales staff was nice and patient. Time there spent was a little longer than expected, but was well worth it. Give these guys and place a try. Ask for Miguel, he is a great salesperson!",4.8
11,"November 29, 2016","Horrible dealership! DO NOT buy from West Loop Mitsubishi!!! They are liars & rip you off in the finance department! Finance Mgr, Rollins Collins, the salesman, Darryl Coleman, and Sales Director Calvin Walker are all in it. They commit income fraud to get you approved, pull a ""yo-yo"" financing scam, switch & bait, misled on advertisement for 2016 Mitsubishi Outlanders. They don't honor hail damage discount, nor free car wash & oil change in addendum. They pull ""car straw"" purchases and ""cash back"" schemes on advertised rebate cars. I filed a complaint with the BBB and am filing a complaint with the OCCC and OAG. They should lose their dealers license for these ILLEGAL Business Practices!!! ",1.0
12,"August 21, 2016","Saw a TV commercial so went in to buy an inexpensive vehicle.  When I got there no one had any idea about their 65% off 2015 mirage advertisement.  I was prepared to pay cash  but it appears to be a bait and switch advertisement.  Left.  A few days later West Loop advertised a 2015 Mirage for $5295 on TV.  I went to the dealership again.  Once the manager saw it was me, He stated that the one vehicle was being held because a woman put $3,500 deposit to purchase the car.  But of course he could show me something that cost more.  I know BS when I hear it.  If I wanted a vehicle held, you put down 10%, $600, not $3,500 or you just buy it out right at a $5295 price.  If you go to West Loop Mitsubishi on some great advertisement,  expect ignorance or that vehicle to be gone.  These are the Bait and Switch experts.",1.6
13,"November 07, 2015","With this dealership being our last, being turned down everywhere else, after losing hope, Jose(our salesman) worked as hard as he could and a few hours later we walked out with 2!!! Brand new 2015 cars! A lancer and an outlander sport!! Exactly what we wanted . Everyone worked hard to seal the deal and guarantee our happiness! We're very excited about our new cars and even more excited that Jose was able to everything he could for us!! Thank you again Jose & west loop Mitsubishi ",5.0
14,"May 25, 2015","This place should be shut down.  They prey on low income earners.  They sent a flyer giving up to $6000.00 of a Lancer or Outlander plus sent an email stating to print and bring in to get an additional $1500.00 off.  So a $19,105.00 would have put us in the $12,000.00 range.  15-18% interest would have put us in the $430.00 payment range.  They didnt even try to work with us given the position we were in.  They immediatly looked at us as suckers.  Demetrius took the flyers and told us it was trash. Then he proceeded to BS us with hidden fees that jacked the payment up to $675.00.  He also tried to sell us on the notion that getting into a payment like that would be a good thing because paying off the trade in would be a good mark on our credit and sometimes we make sacrifices to get ahead in life.  These guys are crooks and should be thrown in jail.  Demetrius and the ""Sales manager"" are the typical shady class acts.  They had no problem with us walking away because they know some poor sucker will come in and fall for their crap.",1.0

17,"February 28, 2013","I had a great expierence going to this dealership, the dealer was very friendly and did everything to make it a good expierence.  This was my first new car to own, i love it. I got a Mitsubishi Lancer.  I love the gas mileage it gives me, I am getting a lil over 39 mpg compared to my last car which only got an average 22.  It is a very smooth ride and I am very pleased with what I got.  I would suggest the deaership to friends and family or anyone who is looking for a good deal and nice car.",5.0
18,"November 01, 2012",I was doing my car shopping when i meet a sales consultant at West Loop by the name of Steven Hudson....Very Very professional.  I have bought many cars in my lifetime and i have never felt so comfortable while purchasing a vehicle before.  I never once felt pressured to buy anything and honestly had a great time just talking with him!  IF YOU ARE LOOKING TO PURCHASE A CAR I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND CALLING MR. HUDSON @ 210-509-3777.,5.0
19,"October 14, 2012","We were looking to replace a five year old car that we had purchased new when we decided on a mitsubishi. Mr. Apaez was friendly, informative and willing to work with our budget. Unfortunately we had an accident in our new Lancer but due to the safety features and to the fact that we came through almost completely unscathed we knew we had to purchase another mitsubishi. My husband and I again sought out Mr. Apaez because we were so happy with the service we received previously. I must say, we feel Mr. English in finance did try to get us to jump through too many hoops and waste an inordinate amount of time. However, in the long run we are very happy with our Outlander and are recomending the mitsubishi brand to everyone we know.",4.8
20,"October 11, 2012","I originally came in to have my 2007 Mitsubishi Galant checked out by service. The Check Engine soon light had come on and I wanted to make sure there was no real trouble under the hood.  It had come across my mind as newer versions of the Galant were coming out over the years that I would want to trade it in soon as I get bored with the same model after a few years. Turns out this was a great day to trade in.

As my Galant was in service I ran across Mr. Efren V. Apaez in the lot and found a true professional. We test drove two new 2012 Galant’s with variable styles and options. During the entire process in dealing with Mr. Apaez I never felt pressured to buy a certain model or upgrade to feed the bottom line. It was a refreshing change from many car salesmen that I had come across that try and add on things and beef up the monthly cost just to move cars. 

As we proceeded through the finer points of the deal I saw that Mr. Apaez was truly genuine in his approach and honestly answered all my questions as we proceeded. I figured there was a catch, but as the deal went through I saw that there were no tricks as civility and truthfulness remained a constant. Even checking in on me as I transferred my things from one car to another and conversing with me way after the deal was in writing. In my opinion I believe that Mr. Efren V. Apaez is an excellent salesman who did his job with integrity and professionalism in a way that will now make him my first choice of salesmen when trading in this vehicle in a few years.

21,"July 19, 2012","I took my Endeavor in to have a paint job  (luggage rack paint peeling off after car wash) while still under warranty. When dropping it off, I mentioned that the mileage upon completion of a prior job noted on my last work order was not correct. I also mentioned that I had concerns about the luggage rack that was being painted possibly not matching the other after the job was completed, and stated that wouldnt be good.  As I walked away towards the customer waiting lounge, I heard a distinct whistle come from Mr. Eric Macias, the Service Adviser that I had been talking to and given my keys to.  It was definately not a complimentary whistle, but more the type that indicated he thought I was asking for the moon and maybe demanding too much?!

I work with the public myself, and there is no way that either me or my colleagues would ever dream of showing our opinion of a customer that we might think of as demanding or direct in their expectations. Mr Macias did so today with his ridiculous whistle, and and later with his disrespect towards me when I arrived to pick up my vehicle. I asked for an invoice or some sort of paperwork for todays visit (he just handed my key to me and never offered an invoice).  He told me that he didnt have that ready and I could come back for that on another day.  I then explained that I would not be returning to this dealership (Westloop) and the he was the reason. I began to try and explain the reasons for my decision and he just walked off. I will call and speak to his supervisor to request a copy of the invoice and will not return to this dealership, even though it is very close to my home.
Incidentally, I have owned two Mitsubishi's over the last 10 yrs or so. Both times I approached Westloop to buy a car and both times, I ended up going all the way across town to Gillman Mitsubishi to buy my cars. Just sayin........",1.5
22,"December 13, 2011","Lied about the cost of the vehicle. When Scott told me the price was going to be discounted 3,000 dollars I was happy. But when the final paperwork was done I found out that the price was still the same. Also, when 1 of the workers took my car He broke the turn signal, and when I asked about it, he said he never used the blinker. Scott basically said we were liars and became very rude and said go somewhere else.We did not purchase.",1.0
23,"October 15, 2011","Liars and ripoff artist. Will quote you a price and write it up for thousands more and extend the term on your contract to make you think the numbers are correct. Will play a shuffle game with the papers. Do not provide copies of all of the paperwork They are scum steer clear!!!!! A guy on the radio Jerry Reynolds the ""Car Pro"" does not recommend them because of thier deceptive business practices and bad service. Try Gillman Mitsubishi.",1.0
24,"June 19, 2011","Worst experience ever! My son went to get a car and his old car (in my name) was to be traded in. The new car purchase was contigient on our trade and I made that very clear to the Sales Manager. The had ""all kinds of options"" on financing. They failed to tell me, that if I didn't finance the car in my name that they couldn't take the trade.  They got my son's friend in there to sign the paperwork, purposely keeping me out of the ""loop"" and I lost the opportunity to make my trade.  THey did this on purpose and are liars. I confronted them on the phone and in person, only to get rude responses and don't give a damn attitute...cause the deal was done, screw me!  Plus 2 months later, the STILL have not sent the contract to signer.  I don't know what they charges for the car or what else they added to the contract. I am going to Mitsu HQ to complain, as per a previous reviewer suggested.",1.4
25,"July 16, 2010","Never, never deal with West Loop.  They will lie to you with the numbers, they will no provide a copy of your documents, they will add a protection plus (almost 1,000) to the price of the  vehicle, dont buy that.  That is why we have Car Insurance. They will tell you that comes with the car. From the finance people to their GM they are no professionals at all. Another thing, dont buy the Gap insurance with them go with the bank you will save money. A good advice call the Mitsubishi HQ costumer service line an complaint, complaint and complaint.  They will take your complaints very serius and you will have an answer in 24 hours.  I own 7 Mitsubishi's, for me is the best car on the market. But dealing with West Loop was very unplesant. ",1.0
26,"November 16, 2009","1) The salesman gave me a offer and changed it to a higher price when we sat down. His explaination for changing price was that he gave a wrong offer, a slip of the tongue.

2) Hidden warranty not wanted. Cost a lot but worth nothing.

3) Long waiting time for Service. It may take an hour to change oil.",2.0
27,"May 05, 2008","Had seen a car in Sundays add for $8.995 and was looking to trade in my truck for a gas saver.

Visted the show room and spoke to chad,  he then told me the car i was looking at was $15,000, we then went inside to do paper work and then he informed me my truck was only worth $6.100 ( I had checked the Kelly blue book value that morning and had seen the truck was worth $10.500)

When I complained about there trade in value the manager came into the office and was very rude, very unprofessional.............

I would nor recommend friends or family buy from these people, unless you want to get ripped off.",1.0
28,"May 17, 2006","I stopped by the dealership one evening to trade in my vehicle, spoke with a salesman, gave im all my info, vin# for trade, he showed us a few vehicles, advised him we could come in the next day after work at 7:30pm, he introduces me to his manager he tell me his name I tell him mine and introduce him to my wife, salesman tells him we will be back tomorrow, its about closing so say our goodbyes. The next morning around 10am I give our salesman a call, asked if he has run my info that i signed off on. He advised he had not but all would be taken care of by the time we get their. I asked if we were still gonna be their at 7:30, I advised we would, his manger calls later that afternoon, advises the salesman told him we would be their at 7:30pm and he can't wait to see us, the salesman also calls us about the same thing so we are pretty happy. We get their, @ 7:30 on the dot with all are important papers, check stub, proof of residency, etc,..the manager comes up to me who I shook his hand the night before, who had called me twice before ask me, when I walk up to him if I know him have we met before and do I need help.....I advised him we shook hands last night. He asked if I was looking for my salesman who was expecting me at 7:30om, well he informs me he is at the mall filling his glasses prescription,......then they try to stick me with another salesman who knows nothing about anything about the work my so called salesman was working on!!?? Turns out the salesman never even ran my info even after i signed off on it. The guy shows up 40 minutes later,...the young salesman who was trying to cope with a pissed off customer who was getting ready to walk is helping me out,...who I have warmed up to already was taken aside by my original salesman who looked agitated that I was working with this new left me outside for another 25 minutes,....by this time I am furious, they finally run my info want me to put down an ungodly amount down I advised since the beginning that I could only give them $500 down and could make a higher payment of $450-$500, They were giving me 12k on my trade in but I would still owe $4k, the manager who had called me earlier is now telling me hold on to my vehicle we can't do anything and cya later!!!!!???? I am so pissed by this time. I go the next day to Metro Mitsubishi now called LoneStar Mitsubishi and they take my trade in, take off $4k from the vehicle to offset the trade in, I gave them $500, had me and my wife on the car loan in 3 days. I will never refer anyone to that dealership. Never do business at Westloop Mitsubishi!",1.4
