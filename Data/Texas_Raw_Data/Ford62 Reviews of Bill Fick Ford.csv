1,"December 10, 2018","I have a 2018 f250 diesel and had run into an elk. Keep in mind I did not buy the vehicle from Bill Fick so I was worried about how I would be treated But, I dealt with Randall Miller in Service and Danette in the collision center and they were both the kindest most helpful individuals you could ask for. everything was done very professionally the body shop emailed me constantly keeping me updated on the work being done and service was second to none. Needless to say I asked the Collision Center to remove my dealer sticker on the tailgate and replace it with their own. Almost forgot to mention the total repair took only 7 days!!!",5.0
2,"October 01, 2018","Bought my F250 brand new in 2015 from Bill Fick. I’ve had it in Fick’s body shop and service department multiple times. I have NEVER been impressed with either. There is no attention to detail. My radiatior still leaks as it did before I had my whole front end fixed as part of an insurance job. They’ve painted my door handle and rear corner of my bed. One has dirt/dust particles under paint while the other is streaky. The most infuriating part is I take my truck to them for an aliagnment to get rid of my death wobble. Without my truck for the day and a charge to my charge I get my truck back with no change in the wobble. Had my brakes changed at a small shop later on and they pointed out the issue for free and offered up advice. Something Bill Ficks dealership has never done for me. It’s always “ ok, ready to pay? Take your truck and leave.” Do yourself a favor and deal with someone who cares about you and your vehicle. ",1.0
3,"July 17, 2018","I brought a 2001 Ford Ranger in for repairs that had lost power and wouldn't run.  It has 175,000 miles, bought it used, and had never been tuned up.  They replaced sparkplugs, wires and coil, and got it back running. The mechanic assured me that was all it needed.  ($1100).. During the process they disconnected a vent hose from the AC to inside the cabin.  When I got the truck, the AC was blowing but not into the cab.  I brought it back and was told there was a plugged line that had to be replaced.  I told them it worked when I brought it in and they rechecked it and connected it correctly.

Then a few days later the engine started running rough and barely made it to the shop.  I was told it was a ""sending unit"" costing $500 and $400 in labor to replace.  I took the truck back and did some research.  The sending unit ($500) is attached to the fuel pump.  A new fuel pump with sending unit can be found for $170.  Lifetime warrenty too.  Asking a few professional mechanics I found out that a ""sending unit"" only monitors the fuel gauge.  Basically telling how much gas is in the tank..  It has nothing to do with the performance of the engine.  Had I let them replace the unit (over $900) the engine would still have not run properly.

 I will never let them work on my vehicles again.  I just cant afford random parts replacements.

4,"August 09, 2017","Their body shop is second to none! Great repair work, and the office employees treat you like family. No matter how busy, they always make time to address all your concerns, whether by phone, or in person. They work with the insurance companies, and rental agencies. Thank You!!!!!!! I would, and have, recommend them to friends and coworkers. ",5.0
5,"June 08, 2016","SO HAPPY with our experience and personnel at Bill Fick Ford's Service Dept.  We took our Mustang to Gullo in Conroe.  They got rid of the clicking sound the A/C was making but didn't fix the cause of why the A/C wasn't cooling as it should.  Plus, when we asked about the rattle in the back, they said, ""Oh, we forgot to look at that"".  $100 pd to them for basically nothing.  Because the car was still under warranty we then went to Bill Fick.  They FIXED the A/C, replacing the evaporator coil, replaced the rear sway bar links and bushings and of course fixed the airbag recall issue.  THESE WERE MAJOR ITEMS GULLO FORD OVERLOOKED.  I will gladly recommend Bill Fick Ford.",5.0
6,"February 23, 2016",Body shop has had my wife's car for over a month. Have had excuses after excuses as to when the car will be ready. Extremely disappointed with service. ,1.0
7,"February 26, 2015",Everyone at this dealership is wonderful! Have bought 2 new vehicles from them. Would not hesitate to send any friends & family there. I know for certain they'd take good care of them & treat them fairly. Highly recommend this dealership! ,5.0
8,"August 19, 2014","I believe I worked with bobby. I had my heart set on 2 trucks at the dealership. I tried and loved both trucks. I admit I was trading in an older truck but in perfect working condition, leather seats, gooseneck, etc. I had been to several other dealerships that all offered me 5500-6000 for my vehicle. When I came to bill fick, they insulted me with a 3000 offer!!!! They wouldn't comprise, they wouldn't work with me, nothing. I was prepared to put a large cash down payment and purchase a 40,000 truck. They let me walk out the door over 1500 dollars. This is the worst experience and I would never recommend this place to anyone. Whoever runs this place needs a reality check. ",1.0
9,"September 01, 2013",EVERYTHING WAS SO GOOD TILL WE S AW THE DAMAGE DONE ON THE PASSENGER SIDE OF THE CAR WAY BACK BEHIND REAR DOOR.  EXTENDING OVER TO BUMPER.  THEY TRIED TO COVER IT UP WITH PAINT BUT THERE IS SMALL CHIPS OF PAINT MISSING AND SEVERAL BAD SCRATCHES. WE WILL BE RETURNING IT FOR REPAIR.  KELVIN IS A GREAT GUY AND SO IS EVERYONE ELSE.  ANOTHER THING WHILE I WAS TRYING TO GET A IDEA WHAT THE PAYMENTS WOULD BE I NOTICE IT DID NOT A DD UP.  WELL ANOTHER MAN DID WHT EORK AND ADDED THE WARRANTY IN WITIH IT.  NICE TRY BUT I CAN SEE THE FIGURES WERE WAY TO HIGH. THEY NOT EVEN ASK US YET IF WE WANTED THE W ARRANTY HE JUST ASSUMED WE DID. WELL HE ASSUMED WRONG AND THAT IS A SNEAKY WAY OF TRYING TO GET IT ADDED IN.  NOT KELVINS FAULT AND THE THE FINANCE MANAGER SOMEONE ELSE. ,4.0
10,"August 28, 2013","Terrible service and false representation of the warranty. Vehicle was supposed to be a certified pre-owned, but has had SEVERAL problems, mostly with the electrical system, since the purchase. Then, several times, they tried to charge us for the service when it was their fault. We have gotten the run around from them several times and they are very rude every time we deal with them. Sales will not work with you on pricing and tried to rip me off several times. Did I say the service is inept and rude? It also seems that the managers do not care and get irritated when you bring a problem to them, instead of righting a wrong. ",1.0
11,"August 24, 2013","Contacted brisn about a new expedition, after working through the wants and needs we selected a vehicle and agreed upon a price through e-mail

12,"August 18, 2013","Kelvin was a great and knowledgeable person about the cars and trucks at the dealership. He went above and beyond the call of duty to help me out and get my a truck that I always wanted, he is an awesome individual and I recommend him anyone looking for a new car!! Excellent experience!!",5.0
13,"August 11, 2013","Kelvin Riddler was extremely helpful, polite, and answered every question I had.  I am not familiar with how to operate gadgets like navigation systems, sun roofs, etc., but Kelvin was very knowledgeable not only concerning every gadget in the cars, but also the more necessary functions of the cars themselves.  I cannot say enough about Kelvin.  I took a while to make up my mind - several hours in fact, and two test drives of each of the two vehicles I was considering, but Kelvin was happy to take me on all the test drives I wanted and gave me really helpful, impartial information about each of the two vehicles.  He didn't hurry me at all, unlike some other dealerships I have visited over the years.  I recently had an unpleasant experience at another dealership, and I was very happy that my experience at Hillcrest Ford was so much better.  Kelvin's customer service approach was really refreshing in the car dealership business.  What impressed me the most was that Kelvin concentrated on me, was not distracted by other things going on in the dealership (yet another bad experience I've had elsewhere) and having given me all the facts on the cars, gave me time to decide and ask any final questions.  It was quite late when I left the dealership, but I am so very happy with my final selection.  Thank you Kelvin.",5.0
14,"August 05, 2013","BEST CAR BUYING EXPERIANCE EVER!! I was in and out quickly. I do not have the best credit and did not qualify for a new car but they worked really hard and found me a barely used one that I absolutely love! They gave my top value for my trade in, and reworked the finance numbers until I was comfortable with them.  So not what I expected from a car dealership, (& I have had a couple bad experiences at the other large dealership in town.)  I felt like I was the one in charge and was not being pushed around by the dealer. The paperwork process was completely paperless on a desk with a built in touchscreen PC and took all of 10 minutes! Thank you Jeremy, Chase, their managers and the ENTIRE Hillcrest team!.....
.........Including the Quick Lane Service and the Body Shop! I went to Hillcrest because their service, parts and body shop departments had always treated me right the last couple of years. They helped me fix what the local lube chain messed up and gave me a fair deal on brakes, tires, and body work on my old Toyota minivan. I am completely happy with ALL their departments and know where to go if I need ANYTHING related to my car and future vehicles! ",5.0
15,"July 29, 2013","Purchase of the truck went great, went in for warranty work and was told they couldn't duplicate the door handle problem , and had ordered the tail lights which were full of water, they had it for a week and couldn't get them? I repair cars and could have them the next day. So I replaced the lenses.
 I developed a heart condition and was laid up for a few months, I called to schedule the door handle and was told I would have to leave it again, for how long?
What ever you do don't give them a negative on there report card, the courtesy will be gone. Typical dealer traits. I will never buy a new $60k truck again. Even though I need one.",2.4
16,"July 21, 2013","These guys were absolutely awesome! I really am grateful to Ron and, his manager and, anyone else who was involved for staying so late waiting on us to make our way all the way from Tulsa to help me get into the exact car I wanted. They were very polite and, a pleasure to work with!  Thank you all so much! God bless! I would definately recommend them to my friends.",5.0
17,"July 17, 2013","I came.  I test-drove.  I purchased.  This was by far the best car buying experience I have had.  Adam Chernosky was very professional, helpful and cordial.  I never felt pressured to purchase anything other than the vehicle I drove to Huntsville to acquire.  I appreciate how the internet has changed how we shop for vehicles.  Daniel Strickland was also very helpful when it came time to finalize the financing.  Thank you again, and I am very happy with my purchase.  Great salesmen, great selection of vehicles.  It was worth the drive.",5.0

19,"July 13, 2013","This is the third truck I have bought from Hillcrest Ford.  My memory of the first two, (a few years ago), are all good.  This time though, was even better.  I was really not looking forward to buying another vehicle.  I stared out looking online at different dealerships inventory, to get a feel for what was available, and the price range.  I had been doing this for about 3 or 4 months.  Then one day I was looking over the Hillcrest inventory online and saw a truck that fit what I was looking for.  Submitted a information request online, and within probably about 30 mins David Larkins from Hillcrest called me.  We set up a meeting time.  He had the truck already brought up to the front ready for me to take it on a test drive.  My wife and I drove it around for about an hour.  Got a good feel for it.  Liked it.  Went back to Hillcrest.  David was waiting to see how it went.  We talked about the pros and cons of this various model.  He was very informative on this model.  I wanted to add a stepside bar and trailer hitch without upgrading to a higher convenience package.  He said they could make that happen.  So, we then discussed price.  I liked their offer, we filled the credit app. and then made the purchase.  David and everyone at Hillcrest made the whole process very easy.  I would recommend then to anyone looking for a vehicle.",5.0
20,"June 11, 2013","My first experience buying a new car was excellent!  Adam was outstanding and helped me to understand what vehicle was best for me while keeping my price range in mind.  His knowledge, honesty, and friendliness made sure my first buying experience was perfect.  I would highly recommend working with Adam and the staff at Hillcrest to buy a new car.   - Craig",5.0

David and the other personnel were very patient and helpful as I looked at several options.  Adam, in the Service Department, was also helpful in enabling me manage the costs on my old vehicle as I evaluated whether to repair it or seek a new vehicle.  David demonstrated several vehicles, provided very helpful explanations and other information, and made the sales process go very smoothly.",5.0

30,"March 23, 2013","Daniel Strickland deserves an award for the incredible job he did getting us our new Form Mustang.  I purchased this vehicle for my son and at the last minute I found out that I told Daniel the wrong color!  When I told him he didn't get the least bit upset but rather said we should get the car we wanted He handled everything and my son drove home today in a Black Mustang, Not a Metallic Gray!   Thank you Daniel and we will see you next year when my daughter turns 16.

No one had ever informed me of this before.  He saved me more more and it is very much apprerciated.  I purchase vehicles every 3 years and I will definitely come back to Hillcrest Ford for my next car.  Thank you David and thankyou Hillcrest Ford.

Thank you all!!!!",4.5
33,"March 07, 2013","This is my second buying experience at Hillcrest Ford and both times I was treated in a courteous, friendly, respectful manner.  All procedures, forms and pricing were explained fully.  Any delay, and there were few, was explained.  In short these folks do a great job and should make Ford very proud.  These folks are the ""marines"" of car sales and care.  ",4.8
34,"February 16, 2013","Ron is a top notch sales guy. He will do whatever it takes to get you financed. Man is good at his job! We've been to other dealers in the past that express the same confidence, but fail to deliver. Not him. He talks the talk, but he walks the walk also. That is what makes a good salesman. The rest of the staff was as equally pleasant, & we really liked the finance guy as well. Just really good people skills here! Highly recommend this place. Oh and they are quick!

36,"February 03, 2013","About Kelvin Riddler: He was attentive, informative, answered my questions satisfactory and explained the process of purchasing a vehicle thoroughly; walking me through it step by step. I didn't feel pressured in making any decisions. Kelvin helped me find the car that fit my needs and budget. He was pleasant, patient, and made the process of purchasing from the Ford dealership a delightful experience. I love my new car and found a dealership I will purchase from again and recommend to my friends. I wish him and the dealership all the best.

About John Addison: He was my finance manager who made the experience better than I ever experienced with other dealerships. He had patience, and spent time with me to find a plan to fit my budget. He worked with Kelvin and knew my profile so he was very informed to my needs and finances before I met him. He was attentive, knowledgeable and pleasant. I know I will return to the Ford dealership again and in showing my new car to my friends will refer him to them. I am comfortable with my financing and will enjoy years of worry free driving.",5.0
37,"February 01, 2013","After going to the Houston Auto Show we were set on a new Explorer for 2013. We contacted Hillcrest looking for a long time friend who was in sales there only to find that he was no longer there. 
Ron Gunnels took the time to talk with me and while we were on the phone found several vehicles that he could have delivered to Hillcrest as his Explorer Inventory was low due to demand. 
Ron found the exact color, options and deal for us. He found ALL the available rebates and the deal was taken care of immediately. We were paid a fair price for our trade and were happy. 
Ron had some dealer installed Ford Accessories installed for us and we picked up the vehicle a day later. The vehicle was ready ON TIME as promised!
We use Hillcrest due to a long term friendship with my salesman as I said earlier but have fallen in love with their FAST LANE Service Department on our prior Ford Vehicles.
I heartily recommend RON GUNNELS and HILLCREST FORD to anyone needing a new or used vehicle. It is worth the short drive to Huntsville. ",5.0
38,"February 01, 2013",What a great bunch of young professionals.  I particularly appreciated the no pressure approach that Daniel took.

47,"September 11, 2012","Over the years I've been to many Auto dealerships across this country. Ford, Chrysler, Dodge, Pontiac and some that isn't made anymore. This dealership, Hillcrest ford in Huntsville Texas, is the most professional, knowledegable and helpful team I've ever met.I beleave everyone in the building introduced themselvs and shook hand with me.  I explained to my salesman, Daniel Strickland, what I was looking for and the price range I felt most comfortable with. He ""SHOWED"" me his inventory of the ford I wanted and I made my desission within an hour after arriving at Hillcrest Ford. Daniel had an answer for every question I ask and in language I could understand. In other words, without a bunch of automotive terminology I would not have been able to grasp. I'm very happy with the Ford my wife and I decided on, which without Daniel Stricklands help it would have been much more difficult. The finance Dept was most efficient and expeditious.I recommend Hillcrest Ford to anyone looking to buy a new or used car. Thank you Hillcrest Ford.",5.0
48,"August 29, 2012","David Schneider worked hard for this sale. He stayed late to answer my questions which we appreciated. He tries very hard to do what he says he is going to do-something that is foreign to many salesmen these days. 

Unfortunately, the truck we purchased had a snafu with the a/c and it took a week to get the part and have it installed. That is where my Hillcrest Ford service department experience was soured a bit. After dropping the cashier's check off on Monday, we were finally told by David on Thursday that the electrician was out on vacation. If I had been told this on that Monday, my expecatations wouldn't have been so high. 

I would definitely recommend David Schneider to my friends and family. He is a hard worker and loves what he does. Thanks, David!

49,"August 04, 2012","By far the worst experience we have ever had... 
We drove 110 miles to look at a truck on their lot. Made sure they knew that we already had our financing lined up and ready to go. 
They told us that by law, we had to fill out a credit report document. But since we already had our own financing setup that a Credit Check WOULD NOT be run...all this before we could even talk about the price of the truck...
*******they ran the credit check anyway, for their own information, before we knew it their finance man was sitting in front of us begging to let him get us financing. We ended up leaving, we were not happy about being LIED to. Why not tell people, yep we are going to check your credit wether you like it or not.  Jason Ebert is the person that ran the credit check WITHOUT authorization. And KELVIN RIDDLER is the salesman that looked right at us and swore, they were NOT running a credit check. We have A+ credit and feel like that's none of their business. 
******we will never go back there again, sorriest people we have ever tried to do business with*****",1.6

As a 23 year Air Force veteran, I appreciate their military-friendly attitude and hard work to find me the beat deal! I drove 60 miles to visit this dealership (passing 6 closer Ford dealerships) based on a recommendation - so glad I did! Use Hillcrest Ford - you won't be disappointed!",5.0
53,"May 29, 2012","We just stopped by just to ""look"". As we were pulling in David was already coming out the door. We honestly though we could outrun him until we discovered he had a golf cart. He was friendly and accommodating from the start. This man is a born salesman. You almost just want to buy something just yo shut him up. He was friendly, fast, knowledgeable and could even make I laugh. Dealership worked in our favor and bent over backwards to make our experience a GREAT ONE. Would ABSOLUTELY be a repeated customer but only if Schneider is there to run me down in the parking lot. David you and your gang are the best. Thanks again.

55,"April 18, 2012","My new car purchase experience was, by far, the most ""hassle-free"" I have ever had the pleasure of being a part of. Starting with my internet inquiry all the way through handling my trade-in and closing the sale, Brian Creighton was attentive and helpful.  As a person who has been buying and selling vehicles for over three decades, I truly appreciate a sales associate who listens to what I want, then gets it done.  No pushing, no ""why don't we look at this"" - just delivering what I asked for in a friendly and timely manner.
Add to that the personal attention given me by Nathan Lender, in finance (who still remembered the last time I was in the dealership), and I simply couldn't ask for more!

This is the second vehicle I have purchased through Hillcrest Ford, and I will undoubtedly be back when it comes time to buy my next vehicle.  Beyond any doubt, I give Hillcrest Ford my highest praise and recommendation.  They are awesome.",5.0

The only problem was a mix up on the financing rate.  I blame the Ford Motor Company web page for this.  It was unclear and misleading on the Ford page.  We got it straight with the dealer and are very happy with the new truck.  It has exceeded expectation.",4.3

58,"April 01, 2012","I had a 2007 Explorer Eddie Bauer that was unfortunately in a wreck. I found a 2010 Explorer just like what I had- but better- at Hillcrest. Daniel Strickland answered every question I had thoroughly through e-mail and was very pleasant to work with. Chase Ford helped us with the paperwork once I got to the dealership as Daniel was with another buyer. I appreciated the timeliness of everything; I didn't have to wait for anything. Everyone I encountered had a smile on their face. When purchasing the Explorer, the young man (I regret not remembering his name), was extremely easy to understand, friendly, and he went over everything. I was able to add extra servicing options and enjoyed the process of signing the paperwork. The dealership washed the Explorer and topped off the gas tank, Daniel installed the temporary tags, and I was ready to go! I appreciated the sincere friendliness and low-pressure experience at Hillcrest and would reccomend them to anyone looking to buy a vehicle.",5.0
59,"March 02, 2012",They said they had this truck at this price and they actually had it. Not other dealers who bait you and then switch. Great guys/great service. This is my second new car from Hillcrest,5.0
