0,"June 05, 2019","I have mistakenly purchased a vehicle from this place in February. I had to call for 2 weeks to get my first tag renewal and I have now been told that they are not extending the tags anymore. I will be driving illegally on June 8th and the only thing they told me was to go to the tax office. Their advice is for me to waste a day at the tax office, where they may or may not renew my tags, and then I get to pay for tags that the dealership should be handling. I still have no resolution and no one answers at the corporate number. Do not buy from this place. Terrible Customer Service!!",1.6
1,"April 06, 2019","I bought a used truck from here(I now regret)12/28/18. The radio in the truck wasn’t working. I was told at least 4 times that they would fix or replace it. After I took delivery of the truck, I asked about it on more than one occasion. At first it was, we can’t get it in at the dealership due to the holidays. Next was our service department will be calling you to take care of it. I asked when, and Tucker said by the end of next week. I waited patiently... and nothing. It took them over 3 months to pay off my trade in! During which time I was making 2 car payments. Now here I am, April 6, 2019 and I still don’t have license plates. Over 4 months! If you’re interested in getting the run around and enjoy hassle, then definitely buy from here. Robert Casarez was ok to deal with (although he was party to the radio thing). Tucker Saye, on the other hand, will lie to you when the truth would sound better. He’s very crafty at saying ALOT, but does nothing. If his lips are moving he’s lying. ",1.6
2,"October 16, 2018","this dealership met all my expectations. They got me into the car I hoped for with a payment less then I expected. 
No pressure no hassle. The salesman went over most all information I needed to feel comfortable operating my new vehicle. They have been great when I needed a question answered on something after the point of sale. I recommend them all the time to people who are admiring my awesome Stelio. Will I buy from them again? Absolutely!!!!",5.0
