0,"September 29, 2019","Purchased 2018 Murano Platinum. Drove home and the next day just riding down the highway the muffler burns through the bumper. Took vehicle back and the service department kept it for a week and decided I was at fault. After refusing to pay out of pocket dealership decided to repair. Repair was a blotched job and now it is back with the dealership and going to the body shop this time, or so we were told. I was presented with a option to upgrade to make this right plus increase my payment. What a joke.  I purchased a vehicle 3wks ago and have driven it twice. This has been the worst experience but it has been a lesson learned. Not a single referral will be made but this experience will be shared.",1.0
1,"June 20, 2019","First let me start off by stating that I have been a customer of a dealership in Arlington, TX since 2009 and didn't think I would ever make a switch. But after feeling defeated with another local dealer here in Tyler I called Patterson Nissan and explained what I wanted. The manager Dillon Clark took my phone call, I told him what was going on and informed him text was easier. He went out of his way and had my deal done in less than an hour via phone. I informed him that I could not come to the dealership so he had my new Armada Platinum Reserve delivered at my house, my husband and I signed the paperwork and they picked up my trade and it was done. I never had to leave my house, there was no hours or days of back and forth and absolutely no games were played. After the sale Dillon set me up with a salesman by the name of Nelson to answer any questions I had. Nelson was/is extremely pleasant and always answers my text when I have a random question.

But the customer service doesn't stop there. In the service department I have had the pleasure of being paired with service advisor Chantelle Isaac and when I say she is the easiest person to deal with. She truly listens and never seems annoyed with any question I throw at her. She is truly worth the hour drive to have my car serviced just by her customer service.

I could not imagine my husband or I going to another dealership, I have bought over 40 cars in 14 years and this experience was by far the best I have ever had. I am a true customer for life.",5.0
2,"January 09, 2018",Horrible!!! They sold me a wrecked car that was still under warranty...i took it back to repair it and they would never fix it but wanted me to pay over 500 for it.. I'm talking day after I bought this car... they will rip you off esp if you are a lady.  Also will not return calls regarding money they owe me....they also sold another person I know a wrecked car and they had to have it towed home right after buying it and would not take the car back nor refund them their money nor replace car they traded in.. this ended up having to get legal help. ,1.0
3,"November 16, 2017","BUYER BEWARE. We were very happy with the vehicle we chose but after learning we were nailed with a $4000. warranty that we didn't ask for, then told it couldn't be removed, then it could, and later learning that the way this loan is set up although we are paid up several months payments ahead we're still being penalized with interest every day so by the time our next monthly payment comes due in March, we'll owe over $800 in INTEREST alone. We were told they set up the loan that was best for us, yet we found out later that we had other options with other finance companies, including the one our car is financed through. The finance manager, this guys name is Kyle, and surprisingly I was forewarned about him by Larry who was the salesman that rode with me when I tested the vehicle. He said watch out for him because he'll do exactly opposite of what you tell him you want. He was right. Kyle's quite the smooth talker, typical pushy salesman. He was writing numbers down on a piece of blank paper and trying to get me to sign the paper without explaining anything, just sign a paper with a few numbers written on it and it's a done deal. No way that's going to happen. Once papers were signed and vehicle was in our possession, he went from being super friendly, pushy to being completely opposite. He was rude, short, cut my wife off on the phone several times dismissing her questions and concerns. We are going to file a complaint with the Texas Attorney General's office, the BBB and have already spoken to our attorney regarding the Deceptive Practice Trade Act. They don't want to buy the vehicle back, and after this awful experience we don't want to keep it. Kyle really ""fixed us up"" good on this mess. It's going to ruin my credit if I decide to say the heck with it and just walk from it. It's been a bad experience all the way around and it would be wrong of me not to forewarn others to be very leery of this dealership. We talked with Steve, the GM of Patterson and he acted like he really couldn't care one way or the other. They got their sale, they severely misled a customer, put us in what I'm going to label a PREDATORY loan because of the way it's set up, and we're left with this mess. Bacon Chevrolet in Palestine puts this dealership to shame. They went over and above for us in an earlier vehicle purchase, we should have gone back to them instead of taking a chance and buying from Patterson. Won't ever happen again! So let me say again, BUYER BEWARE of this Patterson dealership, BEWARE of Kyle the finance manager, and anyone else who tries to push you into signing anything on the spot. These people have no conscience whatsoever how they do business. ",1.0
