0,"November 02, 2019","Stopped by yesterday to look at a few Corvettes (Never looked at one before).  Dealt with Nathan (Good kid-not the problem here).  Asked if they honored Costco or USAA and the answer was ""yes"".  I showed both my cards and Nathan went to the back to get me a quote.  Came back with a quote that was approx 3500 less than MSRP and suggested I wait a week to check and see if there are any Manufacturers rebates which usually come at the beginning of every month. (I thought that was reasonable).  I thank Nathan, go home and check Bayways website and find the EXACT CAR (double checked VIN #)  for $5500 less than they quoted me not an hour before.  I plan on calling Costco and USAA so they know who what's going on over there.  Again, I don't think this had anything to do with Nathan but whoever calls the shots in the back.  STAY AWAY from this place!",1.0
1,"October 30, 2018",Beware of this unscrupulous dealership. They pulled a bait and switch on young college students. Financed a car for someone who was unemployed with a finance company known for not verifying application information. Never do business with this place unless you want to be taken on the deal. Worst car buying experience ever. One star is too much for this dealership. They take advantage of inexperienced college students. Does it get any lower? GM says they signed the papers. How many of us do without knowing the fine print especially when mislead by verbal sales pitch. If you can‚Äôt trust a business with your young college kid than shouldn‚Äôt be trusted to do business with anyone. The vehicle was way over priced and the finance rate ridiculous. They played some young kids. Buyer beware. Shame on Bayway Chevrolet. ,1.0

11,"April 02, 2017","I had an amazing experience at this dealership with Terry Scott, Johnny Martinez, and Tiana Covington. They were all very helpful and nice. Terry Scott was really nice and worked hard to get me approved to get my new car. I liked that when we got to the dealership and was about to go look at the cars that I was interested in. Terry Scott came up to us and greeted us and asked us what car we were looking at we told him and came back with the keys to the car. Once he told us that we were getting the car he kept us up to date on the whole process. Johnny Martinez he was really nice and quick with all the paper work. They both were very patient with my 2 year old son that was running all over the place while we were there. Tiana Covington she was really nice and went over everything about my car and how to work some stuff with this car like onstar and how to set up things for my auto start. They were all really nice and was a great experience I have ever had at a dealership. I would recommend going to Strickland Chevrolet if you are looking for a new/used car. ",5.0

There wasnt no let's go in and talk a about it. The dealership also didn't have any included packages. The price was the price, simple. And the details of the truck were broken down to the T.",5.0

19,"March 31, 2017",I went to Strickland Chevrolet and I just have to give this staff a shout out. I was instantly greeted and welcomed and not harassed. I spoke with the salesperson named Kyle and what a pleasure! I loved that he was very to the point and was able to answer my questions. I will highly consider this location for my vehicle purchase based on these first impressions alone. I already have an appointment to test drive some vehicles and I can't wait! I loved how Kyle knew all the current incentives and promotions and I think hes going to get me a great deal. All of the staff seemed so friendly. Refreshing experience from a car dealership. Great deals. Great staff. Great job. ,5.0

24,"March 30, 2017","If was soooo refreshing to find a dealer who actually had the vehicles onsite that they had advertised online.  My salesman, Garner Anderson, actually met me in the parking lot before they opened for business.  Any questions that I had which he may have been uncertain about were researched and Garner got back to me with answers.
Tiana drew the short straw to train me in my vehicle.  She was a pleasure to train with.  I loved her sense of humor and her patience was very appreciated!!",5.0

27,"March 30, 2017","I stopped into Strickland Chevrolet a week ago looking for a new vehicle. I told my salesperson that Chevrolet was not my first choice and I was really just looking around, but I walked off the lot with a different car because of Kyle. I've been working in sales for over 10 years and have to say that product knowledge and having a passion for what you are selling is some of the most important features in an employee and Kyle really went above and beyond. He was extremely patient with me and we went through a ton of vehicles. When I specified what I wanted, he listened and narrowed down the options. He wasn't just trying to sell me any vehicle he could. He was genuinely concerned about my wants and needs. He even let me test drive my vehicle multiple times just to make sure I was sure. I commend him for his knowledge in not only new vehicles, but also used (which is what I ended up purchasing) and he made sure I was happy with my selection. The vehicle needed some body work and he got me into a rental until my vehicle was ready and kept communication about my vehicle open and comforting. 
Buying a vehicle is stressful and it's a big decision, but Strickland has an extremely valuable asset with Kyle. I'm very appreciative for his time and patience and I can't wait to refer him to friends and family in the future. Great job! ",5.0

I was grateful that Isaac wasn't a pushy salesman he helped us and he worked with us. He worked to get as good of a deal is he could for us. I would recommend him to my family and friends!,5.0
31,"March 29, 2017","I have been shopping for 6 months for my son Zachary's first car. Every place I went we either didn't care for the sales person, the way the dealership handled things, or no one would deal on the car. When I saw this car advertised online, it was more than I was looking to spend, but I decided to look at it any because of the features. We got along with Neil right from the start. We drove the car, went inside and discussed the sale, but then we had to leave because my son had to go to work. Neil stayed in contact with me but wasn't pushy (I am still answering 4 calls a day telling sales people I have already bought a car). Eventually we came to an agreement with the car, and Neil couldn't have made it easier. Understand that, all of my family and friends take my advice on buying a car....you'll be see many more customers that were referred by me in the future. Again thank you for making this so easy.....my son loves the car.

33,"March 29, 2017","My wife and I have been Strickland Chevrolet customers for the past 15 years. We have purchased all of our new cars (5) through Strickland because of the service levels in all aspects of their business. Our salesman Dy Chhoevn and Garner Anderson were great. They took the time to show my wife and I a variety of options to select the best vehicle for us. Tiana Covington did a fantastic job in getting us familiarized with the Silverado features that we ended up purchasing. Scott Fullerton helped us with the accessories for our vehicle and provided us options to consider that made the best sense for our needs and the overall appearance of our new vehicle. The Strickland team has always been courteous, informative and simply treats their customers as part of the Strickland family. We will continue to be customers because of the customer first attitude that this team models. Blessings, Ed and Patty",4.8
34,"March 29, 2017","We were very satisfied with the customer service provided. I pruchased my truck here a year ago, then brought my mother and father inlaws here to purchase theirs. Now recently I brought my brother inlaw to get his. Outstanding customers service, they will do just about everything to meet your needs. Chuck asked if wanted any water to drink and my wife jokingly replied with ""pepperoni pizza would be nice"" because we all hadn't had lunch yet. 10-15 minutes pass by, and we see chuck walking in with two pizzas! We couldn't believe he actually went and got some! All my family comes here for all their vehicle needs. Will definitely do business here again ",5.0

39,"March 28, 2017","Had a great time dealing with Neil! He was very understanding and honestly made me feel like he was there to help, not just sell me a car. He found a car that was well within my price range and never tried pushing a higher priced car on me. Neil was very straight forward and honest no run around or pricing games like I've had at other dealers.

42,"March 28, 2017","Alex was very pleasant to deal with, and I believe he was trying hard to create a deal that I would be pleased with.  Downside was ages-old ploy of not allowing salesman to have latitude in dealing: he had to keep running back and forth to his manager.  It's time to put that one to bed and let your salesmen do their job!  Almost walked away when I got the other time-worn line: ""No, we can't do that--we'll just take it to the auction.""  In the end, I put out my offer and they accepted it.  We are pleased with our new (although used) 2014 Captiva.   Chris Lindelof",4.0

45,"March 28, 2017","I spent a few months researching before actively shopping, so I knew what I wanted, and was ready to pull the trigger when I climbed in the right car. That said, I do not like to haggle, and I do not need to feel like I ""took"" a dealer. I want a fair deal, good treatment, and excellent follow-up. I want a dealership to tell me what they'll do for me, and do it well, and quickly.

Alex Jaquez with Strickland Chevrolet did all those things!

I found the vehicle on Carguru.com, and with my research I knew the price listed was a good price, but as a Certified Pre-Own with a 12,000 mile limited bumper to bumper (as well as the factory warranty, which is excellent), it was a very good price. They was no haggling, they honored the price, with a minimum of dealer fees attached. I took care of my own financing, as I prefer to do, but I am sure that department would have taken excellent care of me as well. Alex was very patient with me while some minor details were fixed - things agreed upon quickly before the sale - and all promises were honored without dragging feet or complaint. It was an absolute pleasure, compared to some other dealerships I've dealt with in the recent past. I strongly recommend based on my experience!

49,"March 28, 2017","I can not express enough how grateful my husband and myself are to of had such an amazing salesman by our side through the purchase of our new vehicle. The thought of purchasing something big is an overwhelming experience in itself but having Garner Anderson there made the whole thing extremely easy. I was very confused and stressed out by the time we had arrived at the Chevrolet dealership that I almost called it a day but then I saw Mr.Anderson and his appearance was so friendly and welcoming it changed my mood and gave me hopes in finding my vehicle again. Right away Mr. Anderson showed that he wasn't just trying to sell us a vehicle, he was gonna make sure we got my dream truck.... the color is perfect, the price is perfect, the customer service was outstanding,  the truck is perfect!!!!

He then put me in a LS demo for the same money.  I am perfectly happy with it.  The finance guys did a great job and weren't pushy at all.

66,"March 22, 2017","After just returning from an assignment the Middle East we were in the market to buy 1 car  and a truck.  

I sent a inquiry after hours via the internet and I received a call from Garner first thing the next day.  We discussed what inventory what was available and pricing for both new and used inventory.  A 5 minute phone call resulted in me learning what inventory Strickland had.  Most other dealers I contacted couldn't provide this information without me visiting there showroom.  The call was information sharing without in high pressure sale tactics.  It also saved me a lot of time.

Strickland had both new and used inventory I was interested in but my price point led me to a used truck with low miles.  I decide to go and take a look at the vehicle.  

The buying experience was very straight forward and professional.  We worked through both the negotiation and the financing quickly and effectively.  I had been to another dealership the day before and that experience was horrible.  The salesman didn't know his inventory and both him and the general manager played games with the negotiation and vehicle pricing.  Strickland's sales process was excellent and I would commend both Garner and the General Manager (Bobby) for how they interact with their customers.

I would also like to mention Trevor in the Finance Department he is a wealth of knowledge and processed the loan very fast.  We had a lot of questions and he took the time to thoroughly answer all of our questions.

They also recommended options for purchase of the car we needed.  They had the color and features we wanted but we decided to purchase from another dealer based on overall vehicle ratings  of the vehicles we were considering.

Strickland looked at all angles to try and sell us the car (SUV) and it again was done with professionalism and no pressure.

Based on the overall pleasurable experience they made a customer for life for me and my wife.  We would highly recommend considering Strickland for your vehicle purchase.",5.0

Mario also noticed the dull headlights on my car when I dropped my husband off and gave me a quick home remedy to brighten them up. It worked wonders and when I came back with my husband to pick up his car, he followed up with me on the headlight and even cleaned them up more before we left.

On the way home I thought there was a transmission problem and dreaded having to back and hassle over an ""as is"" contract.  I called the salesman (Terry Dean Scott)) and far from arguing, he set up an appointment with John Paterson, his service guru.  upon arrival, I told John that I thought it was a transmission problem.  After driving for a few miles, John diagnosed the problem as a bad caliper on a rear tire.  He had me on the road with two new calipers in a jiff.

We went in looking for a used car (1-3 years old), and Sef found us a demo car for a great price - even made it possible for us to bring home on Christmas Eve!  This was the second dealership we went to, and being new to Texas, it was great to see such a professional team take care of us. Sef had followed up and seems to genuinely care for his customers.
I went back a few days after the purchase and had the technology expert show me all the features and sync my phone to the car (we didn't want to do that on Christmas Eve!) I am sorry I forgot his name but he was great too!! 
Thanks Sef and team for a great experience - we hope to be back for a truck someday and will refer others to you and your dealership;)",5.0

191,"February 09, 2017","My first experience with Strickland Chevrolet was in 1984 when our family of eleven exchanged our 10-yr old Suburban for a new dark blue model. Their expert paint dept. did a great job of enhancing its  appearance by adding some decorative burgundy, horizontal stripes as we requested. It was fun to constantly receive compliments from strangers.  

In the summer of 2000, after all 6 of our daughters had been married between May 1999- May 2000, I rewarded myself by getting a slightly used Impala from Strickland. That car served me well - Especially during the evacuation of my husband and me during Hurricane Ike in 2008. I was able to stock the car with plenty of essentials for our trek to the Woodlands when I needed to do all the driving since hubby Larry had been in the hospital and required time to recover. 

We returned to the dealership and purchased my husband Larry's truck in 2001 which helped with a multitude of projects by us and others who borrowed it. 
Years passed during which we bought other brands of transportation beforeI found myself searching cars again. Looking through a current Consumer's Guide car issue, 
I saw the high rating for Chevrolet Impala and it reminded me of those positive experiences at Strickland. So, we headed back to Strickland and found the perfect choice, a 2017 Impala, with expert assistance from our sales consultant, Dy (Dee) Chhoeun.

295,"January 07, 2017","To Whom It May Concern,

Greetings,

Let‚Äôs see, I almost don‚Äôt know where to begin this unsatisfactory review, but here we go.  I was involved in an accident in the early part of August with another vehicle in my 2014 Chevy High Country.  The vehicle sustained front end and body damage along the passenger side.  I took my truck for repairs to Strickland Chevrolet in Pearland, Texas where the truck was bought.  

The truck remained at the dealership for about 1 month until repairs were completed.  I was amazed at the length of time to repair the vehicle.  I was even informed by one of the service technicians that the vehicle sat in the service department for 4-5 days without being touched.  Upon arrival to receive my repaired vehicle, I noticed there was white paint and scratches along the passenger rear quarter panel.  I as the body shop technician to explain why the body damage was not also repaired.  The technician informed me that they did not conduct a damage assessment on the vehicle and only repaired the mechanical damage and body damage at the front end of the vehicle because that is what I reported to my insurance company.  He told me they though that was preexisting damage.  I said, ‚ÄúAre you kidding me, because the paint on the rear quarter was white and it was very obvious I hit a white car.

I called the body shop manager our, he was defensive from the start.  I immediately realized I was getting no where with him and ask for the dealership GM.  The GM immediately wanted to pass the handling of the situation back to the body shop manager.  The dealership GM was completely useless and offered nothing but excuses of why he was not qualified to help me.  One thing I learned as a 29 year Army officer is that the officer in charge or GM in this situation is ultimately responsible for everything that happens at the dealership.  When I received the customer satisfaction survey from Chevrolet, of course the dealership was given a negative review with comments of what had transpired.  

I took the truck anyway as it is my work truck and I needed it back immediately.  Upon leaving the dealership I drove to a local Sonic for a burger, upon backing at the Sonic, I realized my brakes were failing.  I immediately returned to Strickland Chevrolet and expressed my displeasure with the repairs and safety concerns to the dealership.  The brake fault told me that the vehicle was not tested before it was returned to me.  

The vehicle was placed back into service immediately.  After several weeks, the vehicle was returned to me as being fully repaired.  I drove the vehicle for about a week and the brake problem returned in addition to a noise developing under the truck near the transmission.  I returned to truck to be serviced once again.  When I received the customer satisfaction survey from Chevrolet, of course the dealership was given a negative review with comments of what had transpired.  


After several more weeks, I was informed that the brakes were finally repaired and that that the dealership could not isolate the noise under the truck, but they thought it was the $400.00 custom after market muffler I had installed on the truck.  The service representative informed me they were going to replace the muffler with an OEM stock muffler.  I informed them I did not think the issue was the muffler, but to proceed as needed to resolve the issue.  After several more weeks, I contacted them and they informed me the issue was not the muffler, but recommended that I keep the OEM stock muffler anyway.  I was informed that the insurance company would be charged for the muffler anyway and that I should just keep it.  I told them I wanted the custom muffler placed back on the truck as it was found.  I contacted my insurance company and informed them no to pay the dealership for any repairs associated with the vehicle‚Äôs muffler.  Finally after some time, the noise was isolated and repairs were performed.   When I received the customer satisfaction survey from Chevrolet, of course the dealership was once again given a negative review with comments of what had transpired.  
 

I received my truck back from the dealership once again.  After a couple weeks of driving the vehicle I noticed a popping noise at the front end of the vehicle when the steering wheel was turned or if the truck was driven over a bump.  I also noticed a loud metal on metal rattle in the cab under the dash board near the steering column.  Shortly thereafter, the AC stopped cooling as well.  I cannot verify if the AC problem is associated with the initial accident or some unrelated condition.  I immediately contacted the service department once again to arrange the return of the vehicle for additional servicing.  The service representative told me to bring the truck in as soon as possible for service.  As stated above, this is my work vehicle as well and needed to wait a week or so to return the vehicle for servicing once again.

When I was ready to return the truck for servicing, I called the service representative to schedule the repairs.  I got his voicemail several times, each time leaving him a message.  After several days with no reply, I called the service manager, again getting his voicemail.  I left several voicemails for the service manager with no reply.  After a day I called and left a message for the dealership GM.

After no reply from the GM I placed a formal complaint with GM Customer Service.  The customer service representative contacted the dealership for explanation as to why I had not received a reply from any level of leadership at the dealership.  I was then informed that the dealership is denying providing me with any further service or warranty work on my Chevy truck.  I ask what this decision was based on and the GM customer service representative informed me that the dealership informed then that it was a decision made by the GM district manager.  

My complaint was then escalated to a GM senior account manager.  I explained the situation and my concerns in detail to the senior GM representative.  I expressed my concern that some if not all of the unresolved issues were covered and paid for under my auto insurance policy.  I explained my situation that the dealership is not denying me any future service under my auto policy of which they have already been paid.  I was told by the senior account manager that the complaint was forwarded to the dealership and that the dealership had 48-72 hours to reply.  The senior GM advisor informed me that once a reply was obtained from the dealership, a plan of how my vehicle repairs could be performed and what actions would be taken to resolve the issue, but regardless of the dealership reply, my concerns and needed vehicle repairs would be resolved to my satisfaction.

That was at least two weeks ago and after several calls to the GM customer service department; I have yet to hear back from the senior GM advisor as to the dealership‚Äôs reply and what actions GM would take to resolve my concerns and to get my vehicle properly repaired.  I was informed during my last call to the GM customer service department was that they were still waiting for a reply from the dealership before action could be taken.  I was informed that the senior GM representative would be contacting me the next day with the next course of action.  The day passed with no call back from the senior GM representative.

I am still concerned about the safe driving of this vehicle, how my vehicle repair issues will be resolved and the explanation of what the dealership used as a bases to deny me future vehicle service and that I was no longer welcome at their dealership.  My frustration has now spread from no only Strickland Chevrolet, but now with GM and Chevrolet themselves.  I would expect that a corporation the size and status of GM would provide their loyal customers with a more rapid response to explain the situation and to quickly resolve the issue when customer safety and satisfaction is at stake.

The only issue I know the dealership could have with me that I know of is the 3-4 negative reviews I gave on the GM customer service surveys.  I never imagined that the dealership would take retribution against a customer if they completed a negative review against the dealership‚Äôs professionalism and services provided.  I feel the dealership was given more than ample opportunities to correctly repair my vehicle properly.

I have always been a fan and loyal customer of Chevrolet regardless of local dealership issues.  As a matter of fact, I just purchased a new 2017 Chevy High Country from AutoNation Chevrolet, Gulf Freeway in Houston, Texas as a statement of my loyalty to Chevy and the products they offer.  I like the Chevy High Country so much that I now own two, the 2014 and now a new 2017 one.  The 2014 High Country is still in need of repairs and will be scheduled shortly with the new dealership of which I am very pleased in ever possible aspect possible.

360,"December 29, 2016"," Had investigated new trucks online for several weeks  and realized that a face-to-face comparison was the only way to really decide. Stopped by Strickland's while traveling just to.take a look. I had numerous questions.  The knowledge and expertise of our salesman, David Zach, coupled with an extensive inventory of trucks allowed the opportunity to place several models side by side and to compare the strengths of each.  David was extremely knowledge,courteous, friendly --and never pushy or rushed.  My lifelong buying habit is to buy a new vehicle and keep it for a very long time (10 years plus) so the decision to buy is not made lightly.  Here, in one visit, I found the truck that was going to suit my needs for years to come at a price that I knew to be extremely competitive  (and significantly lower) than any internet 'deals' I had investigated.     After purchase,we sat and had an enjoyable visit with Johnny Martinez who  completed the financing with speed and ease .  And before leaving the lot, Blake Mosley lead us through an extensive and most informative tutorial on the vast amount of electronic and technical wizardry built into this vehicle..

386,"December 23, 2016","I had an awesome experience buying a car with Strickland Chevrolet, the staff and sales personnel was very accommodating and professional, even the young kid (Nile Irsan) that was training with my sales rep. Dy Chhoeun he had the goods of being a great asset and ambassador for the Strickland Chevrolet company brand. I've been to other dealerships and have been treated with disrespect by either being ignored or stereotype to be a ""bull-crap buyer (waste of time). Twice before I went to a Ford and Jeep dealership and was treated like crap (once in Fairborn, Ohio and once in Alvin, Texas) 

This particular day that I stepped onsite at the Strickland Chevrolet dealership was not one of my most personally presentable days (I had been working on cars all day and the clothes that I was wearing was torn and tattered with bleach stains everywhere. I also did not groom my facial hair and was looking like wolf man Jack). I was dressed like a grease-ball bum.  But much to the credit of the Strickland Chevrolet personnel they saw me as a valued customer they treated me with dignity and respect as if I had walked in there in a tailored Tom Ford suit. Strickland Chevrolet has gained a customer for life. I give the whole operation 5-Stars form management, to the atmosphere, to the sales rep (Dy Chhoeun), and even the technology consultant rep (Tiana Covington - she was awesome as well and funny).

I fully recommend that if you are one who is in the market for a new or used automobile then why would you go anywhere else but Strickland Chevrolet in Pearland, TX.   They will take excellent care of you by giving you over the top service. Dy Chhoeun will take great great care of you and treat you with the best professional decorum you will have ever witnessed. He will own his own dealership one day, he has the goods to be phenomenal in this industry. He is Magnificent!     ",5.0

437,"December 07, 2016","I wanted to purchase a new (to us) vehicle for my husband. I found the vehicle I wanted to test drive, called the dealership and asked if it was still available. I spoke with Sam, who said the vehicle was still there, and he'd be happy to show it to me. I drove to Strickland, and the vehicle was backed in ready to go. I was greeted with friendly smiles from everyone, and I was quickly introduced to Sam. He took the time to show me all the features of the vehicle in question, then allowed me to take it for a test drive. He answered any and all questions I had, and I enjoyed getting to know him on the drive. After the drive I decided it was the vehicle I wanted, but I still needed my husband to test drive it. Sam said that was not a problem at all and he told me when he would be available. My husband was able to come earlier than anticipated, but it was no problem. Again, we were greeted with smiles and professionalism. He took the time to show my husband everything, and let us test drive the vehicle again. When we got back, we were able to quickly work out details, and we purchased the vehicle. The whole process was incredibly easy, and professional. I did not feel pressured to make a decision, but I also felt like Sam valued my opinion and decisions (instead of making me feel like my husband was the only one who mattered.) Thank you, thank you!

 Last Friday,  I called Strickland Chevrolet looking for a new truck for my husband and me.  I was greeted on the phone by Dy Chhoeun, who made us feel comfortable in our quest.    He worked diligently to get us a deal even though we had less than stellar credit.  He was honest about our options and was encouraging.  At the showroom he showed us around and guided us through the available cars there.  I must say this was my best car shopping experience ever.   Dy Chhoeun was very informative and answered every question of ours patiently. The financing office with Johnny Martinez was also a smooth process with no surprises.  Again, their integrity shined through.  A salesman like Dy delivers an incredible service and gives a very pleasant experience.  We will be coming to Strickland Chevrolet in Pearland for years ahead.

444,"December 05, 2016","BEWARE!! 1 star is way more then they deserve, but zero stars are not an option on here. I recently purchased a used F150 from Strickland. After my short test drive (that I was allowed to make) I noticed a hesitation or a slip while accelerating. I mentioned it to the salesman Sam and his Sales Manager David. I ask them to have the service center check it out hoping it was something as simple as a tune-up. The Sales Manager returned and said it wasn't the tranny and just needed a tune-up ( which they charged me for. $600!!). I was told there was no warranty on the vehicle because of the mileage, which I wasn't that concerned about because I was buying from a supposable reputable dealer (not a note lot).  A day later after the so called tune-up was done; I picked up the vehicle to drive home. 5 miles from the dealership and after the transmission heated up I noticed terrible grinding noises every time I accelerated. I called the dealership and the salesman and was told there was nothing they could do. The salesman Sam did tell me if it was up to him he'd give me my money back, but it was out of his hands. After taking it to a mechanic shop, it was determined it was the transmission ($3500). Also noted the frame on the vehicle was severely bent. I also wondered why 3 of the tires had the white walls showing and one didn't. After inspecting that tire I noticed a 6"" gash in the side wall. Guess they flipped it around so no one would see.   I wouldn't suggest anyone do any business with these thieves!!  The Lawsuit is coming...",1.4

When we finally talked to the sales associate, we told him we were just looking around and wanted to test drive a Cruze, we didn't think we'd buy today. We went out and test drove one while the associate was determining how much my wife's car was worth as a trade in. He told us $1500 because there were ""multiple"" things wrong with it (KBB value is $4500 trade-in). Lie #1. We were kinda shocked at the lowball offer and told him we didn't think it was worth so little. He laughed at us and told us he couldn't offer more. Lie #2. Now we also work for a company that provided discounts through a code. We didn't have the code with us, but mentioned it to the sales associate and he said he could look it up on his computer. He ""looked it up"" and said yes, we'd get the discount. 10 minutes further into the sales pitch, however, he said we'd have to look it up through our company because he couldn't be sure we had the discount. Lie #3. I asked him about recalls on the Cruze (because my wife has a Cobalt and has had no less than 4 recalls in the past 3 years), and he told me there were ""none that he knew of, it's a pretty reliable car."" Lie #4. I searched Google for ""recalls Cruze"" and found no less than 3 covering multiple different years. One of the things we wanted to learn about was how we could get a 0% interest rate. The associate brought his manager over during this part and he told us we'd have to have a 850 credit score. Now we knew we didn't have that high a score, but he convinced us to have them run a soft credit score just to check (we specifically asked if it was a soft check and not a hard check because we were in the process of buying a house and didn't want it to mess anything up because mortgage companies check that). They freaking ran a hard credit check without our permission. Lie #5. During the sales negotiation, in which the sales associate tried to get us to sign a sketchy piece of paper with some handwritten numbers on it to ""continue the process,"" we continually repeated to him that we weren't comfortable purchasing that day. We wanted to leave, but he still had our keys from checking the trade-in value. We asked no less than 4 times for our keys so we could leave. It was like being kept hostage.
Overall, one of the worst experiences of our lives, a waste of like 4 hours, and I would recommend anyone car shopping at Strickland Chevrolet to double check anything they tell you.",1.8

594,"October 29, 2016","Purchased a 2017 C7 Corvette Grand Sport, one of the first handful in the country. Got it under sticker and beat the pricing of any other dealership in Houston. They also treated me as family, not as some young punk (Being a very young individual it is very easy to be looked over especially when buying an car that cost more than a house). I also made a good friend and fellow car enthusiasts who also owned a Corvette himself. Having just sold a 700+HP Cadillac I had yet to even look or sit in a C7 let alone look at anything other than numbers. So him being able to explain the several packages, aero features, entertainment features, and the little tid bits here and there that would have taken weeks of ownership to notice or even comprehend was a god send. What I want to add is the service department as well. I am a very picky individual when it comes to my vehicles, I work long hours in a dirty environment, when I get home to my toys I like them to be spotless inside and out. When I asked them to keep the windows rolled up and only allow the office employee to drive it, there was no problems! Most dealerships will laugh at you and not care one bit. I had a little hiccup with the car that needed to be corrected, NOT Strickland's fault at all! They took care of it and through in my first Mobile 1 Oil change in for free! That even being WAY before the first recommended oil change being needed. I just wanted to do the first 500 miles so I could see it and make sure there were no shavings in the used oil before I went ahead and did my performance modifications. They facilitated my needs AND, got me in and out ahead of the line that was waiting as they knew I would be staying with the car. After buying an extremely expensive car they treated me correctly and didn't just chock me up as another sell and shoe me out the door. I recommend anybody trying to buy a specialty car come to Strickland! ",4.2

Everyone at Strickland was very supportive of this and continued to answer any questions I had. A few days later I was ready and very excited to make the purchase!

They were gracious enough to let me take the car to the wedding and come back on Monday to finish the paperwork.  Monday came and I was told everything is good to go just come in and sign. I get there and had to wait again over an hour to talk to the finance people. We went through the paperwork where I found out I could not get an extended warranty like I asked and then we were told oh by the way need proof residence before moving forward. I asked why was I not told this before coming and I got an answer of I am sure why you were not told. After scrambling and the use of modern technology, I got what they needed and was given a piece of paper that is conditional  contract for the care depending on financing. As we (me, my wife and the salesperson) were going back over to the used car section of the dealership, I started the car and it died. I told my salesperson that this needed to be looked at because it does it all the time. I felt that my comment was kind of put on the back burner and I was just expected to deal with since the car was used.  As I was driving home for the day the car died again while trying to start it and then halfway home the anti-lock brake warning light turns on. the brake act kind of funny the rest of the way home. The next day same issue with the car starting and I am off to work on the way home the anti-lock brake issue happens again and I call to let them know. I was told to bring it in so they can look at it. This is the part where they are trying. They replace everything with the front brakes and I was told they put a new fuel pump in the to see about fixing the problem with starting up. Meanwhile I get other email stating they need more paperwork for the lender out my car that was totaled. I asked why they need the information and I thought that was a done deal since I signed a contact and was told we mail you the paperwork. I got a general answer about why they need it and was referred to a financial person. I called the financial person to see if what I had would work and I have yet to hear back from the financial person. Here is where my frustration comes in.  I bought my last car from this dealer and my family has bought 3 or cars from them as well. we are repeat customers and it the hoops I am having to jump through are crazy. While I am working on buying another car from them I have my second car in the shop to get AC work done. They were pretty good about getting it done , but I got the car back and my back windshield wiper and my traction control buttons do not work on the dash. I now have to take that car back so they can fix it.

Now form my point of view, between the down payment on the used car and the AC work done. I have spent over $7,000.00 and I have two cars that still have issues. The Traverse that the windshield wiper does not work and the Buick that still dies when you turn the car over. It seems the fuel pump did not fix the issue. At this point I am looking to get my $5,000.00 down payment back so I do not have to deal with them.

  Couldn't be happier with the attitudes, friendliness, and overall treatment that we received at Strickland Chevrolet yesterday.  It was just like being with old friends.   My wife and I just decided to stop by Strickland to see what they might  have sitting on the lot.  Both of us have been burning up the computers and just trying to find that one special deal that we were looking for.  Well, after meeting and explaining exactly what we were looking for to Mr. Terry Scott, our Sales Representative,, we took  a walk around and there it was ...... that just right truck that we were hoping to find but didn't really expect to.  Like  I told Terry,  ""Sometimes it seems like some things are just meant to happen.  That truck is exactly what I wanted and now if we can strike a deal, I'll  be signing some papers just as quick as I can write.""  

  Terry took us over to see Mr. Trever Schumann, the  Finance Manager, who was, despite a serious allergy problem, was just as nice and cordial as Terry had been,  To make a long story short, something that my wife says I'm not very good at, with only a slight bit of bargaining back and forth, trade was closed and deed was given and we were all set up to go home in a new truck that we really had no intention of buying yesterday.  After all, we were still looking, not buying. All I can say is the treatment that we received, the truck and the deal were everything we'd hoped for and we, especially me, just couldn't say ""No""   I've always believed that when something's right ...... it's just right so go for it!

  Before closing, I have to extend a special thanks to Tiana Covington, Certified Technology Expert for showing us all of the gadgets, bells, whistles and that we'll do our best to learn.

  Thanks to everybody at Strickland Chevrolet  in Pearland for making this a truly enjoyable experience.  Sorry if I got too wordy, like my wife says, but I'm truly happy about the deal, the truck,  and the new friends that we made.  Our very best to you. 

Thanks so much!

Talk about dealing with a GREAT Salesman well we sure lucked out when we got Alex Jaquez for our salesman. It was maybe just the luck of the draw that we got Alex but he made buying a truck from Texas a breeze for us. We live in Florida and my husband just happened to call inquiring about this truck. Not really intending to buy a truck in Texas living in Florida especially sight unseen. So I thought maybe I could pull it off and surprise him so thank god for the persistence of his salesman Alex calling him, I got his phone number and called him myself trying to see if it was possible to ship the truck here to Florida. Alex was very professional and made it happen all along keeping it a surprise till the end. I was very worried about buying this truck without actually looking at it first. So Alex sent me pictures from every angle and personally went over the truck mentioning any imperfections. I dealt with Trevor in financing who was Super also. So when the time was right I told my husband that I bought him the truck from Texas and they would be shipping down here. Alex kept in touch with me every step of the way even sending me a picture of our truck leaving on the flatbed. Now that's what you call a Incredible  salesman. In all the years we have been buying cars & trucks I can say this is one AWESOME Salesman! They delivered the truck as promised in the exact condition that Alex described even filled with fuel!

969,"July 19, 2016","Strickland Chevrolet really added a blessing to what had been a down and hard week/end. My car (previous) was having major issues and I had just put a small chuck of money into getting new brakes, booster and other accompanying repairs. Then, after picking up my car from the repair shop (not Strickland, but another shop), I was told I'd need even more repairs. Although I believe there were factual repairs needed, I also felt I was getting taken advantage of, and the cost estimates made me really begin to think getting a new car would be better overall. After researching certain dealerships in my area, I came across Strickland and the various reviews associated. I prayed (smile), and drove to their front door. At this point, I was not 100% that I would get a new car. I planned to just look and evaluate decisions after that (get a new car or put a bit more into old car a little longer). 

To make a long story shortened: this was one of the best decisions made. Upon my arrival, I was immediately met by Alex Jaquez. I can only imagine the way I felt inside was shown all over my face. But Alex was so professional, courteous & knowledgeable...just all around a pleasure to work with. I gave him my previous car ""sob story"" coupled with the fact that I am very recently divorced (ugh!) and needed to feel as though I wasn't being taken advantage of business-wise. Alex asked me questions pertinent to what I was looking for, what was within my budget, etc. etc. My point in this is that he didn't try to take me immediately on the lot and force vehicles on me that weren't tailored to my wants and needs. I can tell he is, again, knowledgeable because (based on what I shared in the office), he was able to take me to 4 cars that truly were within all parameters for my personal and financial life. Although I know he is a sales consultant and in the business of making a sale, I truly did not feel like ""just a number"" or means for him to make a quota. He was patient and attentive in the fact that his eyes didn't glaze over with my 50 million questions and scenarios (smile). During the visit, I also met Chris Ausmus (very pleasant demeanor) and Johnny Martinez. Mr. Martinez patiently walked me through all financial matters, and believe me: I asked several questions, possibly even repeating some of those asked of Alex (lol). Lastly, I ended the day with Blake Mosley who took me through all of the features of my NEW (used) CAR! I tell you: cars have come a long way. I could not (and still can't) believe how many functions are available.

So, if you cannot tell after reading my mini novel above, I am very appreciative to the Strickland team for not only introducing me to my new Chevy Malibu, but for also making a apprehensive, fairly ""broke"" female (after just paying for repairs on my old car) a happy customer! I write such a thorough review because I'm a firm believe that people take plenty of time to complain about things, but won't invest similar time to give compliments when due. I pray my business relationship with them continues to be positive!

970,"July 19, 2016",I have been a ford man most my life. These guys brought me back to being a Chevrolet guy again. Christopher Ausmus and his sales team are there to help anyway they can. Honestly I am very difficult to deal with and they made my past three experiences perfect. Honestly a great price. Great knowledge and service. Anyone that takes the time to read this review I want to say. You can find a low price anywhere but what about after you sign and drive off? Most forget who you are or don't have time for your questions after the sale. Everyone at Strickland has been awesome. For me that means more than just getting the lowest price. I buy a new truck at least every two years and I will be coming back here when I do. My daughters first car will come from here. They really take the stress out of the whole buying and service side too. Thank you Christopher and your staff ,5.0
971,"July 18, 2016","Thank you Terry Scott for working with us late afternoon to find the perfect car for me.    You pulled out several cars for me to drive and didn't mind a bit.   The transaction went well and you went back and forth until we reached an agreement on price.   Appreciate your patience with us and listening to Husbands stories. 

We enjoyed the process and it was painless and quickly completed. 

Thanks again,

972,"July 18, 2016",overall I had a good experience.  Terry and the staff were very friendly and I got a good price on the truck.

I felt like I had raked over the coals on my trade.,4.2

Strickland‚Äôs Service Department is the only place I take my car for maintenance and my service writer Eric Sullivan has always treated me with care and respect.  Having recently been in a major car accident, I was concerned that my car would never be the same.  Julian and Mario went above and beyond to ensure that I was completely satisfied with my vehicle repairs, even taking the time to explain how those repairs were made.  I highly recommend this Dealership!   ",5.0

977,"July 16, 2016","I had the honor of buying a new used vehicle from Strickland Chevrolet today. It was an excellent experience from the moment I first walked into the door until I left the dealership. I had the honor of being served by Alex Jaquez and he was outstanding!!! I love how he instantly met me upon arrival with great customer service. As a professional, I value first impressions and Alex gave me a wonderful first impression of Strickland Chevrolet. There are many highlights of this wonderful experience and it would be impossible for me to express all of them. I loved the high knowledge that Alex had of the area as we took the test drive. He knew exactly the best route to take for the test drive. I also loved how Alex listened to me as I explained to him what I am was looking for in my next vehicle. Prior to this experience, I had car salesmen try to sell me a car that I had no interest in. Alex really listened to me and he was very knowledgeable of the vehicle that I was looking at. I really appreciated how Alex devoted time to ensure that I understood the processes. I also enjoyed how Alex ensured that I got connected with the appropriate personnel at the right time. To say the least, Alex really took care of me during this car buying experience. I have visited many neighboring car dealership in pursuit of the right car and I have to say that Strickland Chevrolet and Alex was by far the best experience for me. As a result, I decided to make my purchasing decision at Strickland Chevrolet. I also appreciated how Alex ensured that the vehicle got cleaned up, fully inspected, and fueled before it left the dealership. All of this really impressed me however what I really loved was how Alex took time out of his day to assist me by ensuring that I got my current vehicle and the new vehicle home. This is the first time that I experienced a salesman care enough to drive my vehicle for me so I got both vehicles home safely. It always feels nice to be treated like a customer instead of the bridge to the next pay check. Alex truly treated like with exceptional customer service skills. I would like to say thank you to Strickland Chevrolet and thank you to Alex for being an outstanding salesman. ",5.0

I SMILED AND SAID YES SIR YOU SURE CAN. HE TOLD ME THAT HIS NAME WAS MICHAEL HUNDLEY AND  HE HAD A GENTLEMAN WITH HIM  THAT WAS BEING TRAINED. WE SAT DOWN AND I TOLD HIM WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. HE SHOWED ME A COUPLE OF CARS AND WE WENT FOR A TEST DRIVE. UNFORTUNATELY AT THAT TIME. THE CAR THAT I WAS LOOKING FOR WAS NOT ON THE LOT. I WANTED A CERTAIN COLOR.

My sales person, Brenda Sullivan, has sold me many vehicles over the years for both personal and work related purchases. She'll find what you are looking for, even if she has to go to another dealer (which she has done for me) to get it so you don't have to drive all over to find that car or truck want.  James Powers, in finance, was prompt to get me in and out so my wife and I could get on the road in our GMC Denali Acadia.

1279,"April 30, 2016","We had been searching high and low for a truck that fit our family's needs. We stopped in at Strickland's, not once, but two or three times during our search for the right truck. We had the same salesperson each time, ""Chris"" (Christopher Ausmus). He was understanding, flexible and mostly accommodating. I find this to be a rare trait in many sales personnel, so we found him to be refreshing. When it came down to assisting with the cost, again he advocated for our requests. We now own a shiny, new, 2015 Chevy Z71 that will keep us comfortable as our family grows. We couldn't be more thrilled with our sassy Metallic Ocean Blue, 4 wheel drive truck and want to thank Chris for all his perseverance to help us make our dream a reality with our recent purchase. Thank you Chris for all of your patience while we went through this process. 

I also need to comment on the service/accessory department, where we were dealing with upgrades and and general cosmetic concerns. It was this department that caused us concern and disappointed due to the lack of ethical and personal workmanship of one individual. We were sold the Aries step rails, but instead a different brand was installed. There was some minor paint issues that needed to be tended to, unfortunately a black colored repair was adhered and not the original blue paint it required. This was extremely stressful and frustrating. Again, Chris came to our rescue and accompanied us to the manager of the service/accessory department to make sure all was set straight. I understand there are time constraints and much to do in any service center, but this should never get in the way of customer satisfaction for repeat business. Despite these minor delays while we waited for our service repairs, we were provided a top quality courtesy vehicle, similar to our recent purchase. This accommodation was much appreciated during our extended wait.

I still recommend Strickland for the many positive attributes during our business endeavors and I believe they have addressed the service issue to provide the best experience for all who walk through their door.

After doing our research online, selecting the truck we wanted, and getting pre-approved for financing (trying to save some of the struggles of car buying), we went to see David Zack, who was recommended through friends. He is an amazing sales person! We will tell everyone we know to go visit him! Not only did he get us in the right truck for us, he did it with a smile, and was willing to answer all 3000 of my questions (and I probably DID really ask this many)! What an unbelievable experience! Thank you for all of your help!!

1386,"March 31, 2016","I had gone to multiple dealerships, looking for a car for my son, before arriving at Stricklands. In fact, I was at a nearby dealership looking at a car. I had talked to Kyle on the phone while visiting other dealerships. He stated that he would be able to provide the right deal and the right car, when I had completed reviewing all other offers. I really needed to do my due diligence. I realized soon, that the other dealerships were not as accommodating, nor did they have the car I wanted. At that very moment, I left the last dealership and headed directly to Stricklands Chevrolet. The atmosphere was totally different. It was welcoming and I felt no pressure. There was no subterfuge. In other words, no switch and bait. They had exactly what they said, and they did exactly as they stated. There was no wait and I'll be back, after I see if I can bait you into another deal, etc. Prior to them, I had waited for over 4 hours at one dealership on Katy Frwy, when the salesman knew he couldn't give me what I wanted and the majority of the time he left me waiting in his office while he went back and forth with his manager, who occasionally came to try to get me to take something other than what I wanted. At Stricklands, the salesman and the manager were for real. I got exactly what I wanted for my son. It was perfect. After my experience with them, I thought that for my next vehicle, I will consider them even for that, even though the model I want, they don't sell. With the service they provide and the salemanship they offer, I'm inclined to consider them anyways. ",5.0

Terry knew this, and had my first car choice waiting for us when we arrived.  We got to immediately test drive two different cars, and moved on to the paperwork.  Shellie Cole was remarkably tolerant during financing negotiations, and very kind to my 5-year-old (who took about a thousand pictures of Shellie during our meeting).

1452,"March 19, 2016","Strickland Chevrolet is an amazing dealership to buy a car from. I worked with salesman Josh N. who made the process easy and smooth. I knew the car I wanted and Josh explained all the features and explained how they worked and what they could do. Josh also went above and beyond what I expected, in the quality of service, to receive. Basically, my old 2003 Malibu, which my dad bought me 12 years ago, broke down on 610 S during rush hour and rodeo traffic. I had it towed to a car repair place in Pearland to have diagnostic. It was going to cost more than the car was worth to fix but of course they try to convince me to fix. I wanted to trade in the car. Josh went with me to the car repair place to make sure I wouldn't get taken advantage of and they would have if he hadn't been there. I do not know much about cars, only basic car maintenance that I need (oil changes, etc). I will never go to that place again. I appreciate Josh looking out for me and being honest, caring, and making the process of buying my first car such a wonderful experience. I don't usually write many reviews, but if you are in the market for a new or used car and want a place where they go way above expectations in terms of service Strickland is the place to go. From the time they greet you to the time you drive away in your new car, you will be treat like you are part of the Strickland family. I place a lot of value on service as I have worked in the retail industry for over 10 years from management to assistant buyer and this was the best I have come across in a long time. Ask for Josh!!!

1462,"March 17, 2016","I searched the internet in the morning and found the car I wanted on the lot at Strickland Chevrolet.  I contacted the dealership and spoke with Sales Manager David Rawls and ended up working with Steven Garcia.  I explained to David that I was pre-approved and that I would definitely be buying the car that evening with a trade-in.  I gave him the information on my trade and requested that he send the car i was buying to make-ready.

When I arrived that evening, my car was sitting in front of the dealership ready to go.  David never asked that I put a deposit on the vehicle which other searlerships have done in the past.

Steven had spent a portion of his day researching my car in detail so that he was prepared to answer any questions I might have upon my arrival or during a test drive.  All of my questions were answered in detail.

The hospitality was top-shelf and the transaction was seamless.  I thought I was familiar with all of the current rebates available on the car I was buying.  David actually found an additional $2000.00 in rebates that I was not aware of.

The following morning, when I contacted my insuracne company to have the trade-in removed and the new car added to my policy, I was advised that Steven had already conrtacted them and given them all of the information with which to draft my new insuracne cards.  My agent remarked that ""Strickland is one of very few dealerships that provide that service to their customers.""

Over the years I have purchased three trucks and two cars from Strickland.  I will continue to do business with them and to recommend them to others as long as they continue to provide the exceptional customer service I have come to expect and appreciate from this dealership.",5.0

1515,"March 07, 2016","The buying experience in itself went fine. The customer service after the sale not so much. I came out to go to work a week after buying a 2013 Nissan Frontier and found a flat tire. I called roadside assistance and was told they could come out and change the tire for me. To my surprise I looked and found there was no spare, even though there was clearly a place where one had been previously. I had to have the truck towed and pay for a repair. Jonathan Martinez had, by this time, called several times to ask me to write a review on my buying experience. When he next called I asked him why there wasn't a spare provided with the truck and why I hadn't been told there wasn't a spare. He replied that they make the inspection on used vehicles under the hood and didn't think to look to see if there was a spare. He promised to look for a tire for me and even to bring it to me once found which helped. I have not heard back from Jonathan nor has he answered my phone calls. I am very disappointed in the follow up service or rather lack of follow up service I have received from this dealership and from Jonathan Martinez in particular. I expect to receive a spare as I was promised and will accept no less. Update: I was contacted by management as soon as my review was received. They asked to meet with me to assess what was needed and once that was done a new factory tire and wheel was ordered for my Nissan Frontier. It has since been installed on my truck and I am happier with my purchase. Thanks Todd Harvey for your help. It is very much appreciated.

1595,"February 22, 2016","Brought in my 2006 GMC Sierra with a leaking top at the front windshield....the folks in the bodyshop checked it out and explained this may or may not be really bad....also told me they probably couldn't warranty it....they were reluctant to do the work until they had a good look at what was going on under the top....once they removed some of the molding around the windshield...they sent pictures to me on my phone to show how bad it was.. and suggested that a new top was the only was to do it right....and the cost would go up.... ""I love my truck""...so I told them to go ahead and do the job....said it would take about seven days.... Bottom line.... they got it back to me in 4 days...saved me 100.00 on a rent car...
and it just happen to rain the next day after I got it back.... and it didn't leak... the old 2006 GMC really looked good after my experience at Strickland... they cleaned it up pretty good, inside and out...best its looked in a long time...plan to keep it that way....

Being a first time buyer is a fearful experience. I had gone to Knapp and Davis Chevrolet and everyone tried to talk me into buying a new car.

I would highly suggest seeking Andre for his expertise in the sales process. ,5.0

1733,"January 26, 2016","When I decided that it was time to purchase a new truck, I researched to find exactly what I wanted and the price that I should expect to pay. I was pre-approved through my credit union who recommended that I deal with Andre Ward. Of course, not having bought a new vehicle in ten years, I initially suspected that having a sales rep recommended to me was going make things more difficult and that I would not be able to ""barter"".  So I emailed Mr. Ward ahead of time with what vehicle I was looking for and the price I wanted to pay.

When I arrived at Strickland Chevrolet in Pearland hours later, Mr. Ward immediately found me and showed me the vehicles on lot with my exact requests. I had even absent mindedly left out a request, but he had no problem adding it to the list and showing me the options. 

Within an hour I had two trucks that I was deciding between. Andre did not push me to decide which vehicle to choose and gave me all of the time and space I needed unbothered. I was offered a great trade in price for my 10 year old truck and Andre worked up two quotes for me to help me choose; with out me even having to request. BOTH QUOTES WERE $2,000+ LOWER THAN THE PRICE I WANTED TO PAY! SCORE!

Now I just had to choose. I was able to test drive both trucks and park them side-by side in the enclosed bay for further comparison. Mr. Ward came out to the bay to both support and joke with me about my indecisiveness. I loved it. About 45min later (yes, I took that long) I had decided on the demo truck.

The paper work was quick and easy, no awkwardness or unreasonable requests, and I had what I wanted cheaper that I had expected. Andre even helped me clean out my old truck before I had to hand it over. 

Andre is GREAT and I would like to recommended him to everyone interested in purchasing a new vehicle. Literally no-haggle and he understood the value of trying to save me as much money as possible and did not pressure extras that I was not interested in. He was able to do what I wanted, while still leading me in the direction he needed with all the patience in the world. Very understanding and down to earth businessman. 

Unfortunately, I plan to drive this truck for another 10 years. But hopefully, when I, or others in my family or friends circle are ready to purchase a new vehicle, Andre Ward will still be there to actually make car buying fun. Like purchasing a vehicle from a friend. 

Thank you Andre and Strickland Chevrolet for making my indecisiveness acceptable and fun!

Our family (more than one family) moved to Pearland just over two years ago and at that time I was in need of service on my 2009 Suburban.  Prior to moving to Pearland I was taking my Chevrolet to the local Ford dealership due to bad customer service in that town,  So to say my expectations were low of how this service would be at Strickland,  To my surprise, I was floored at the high level of wonderful customer service I received from Paul in the service department. I of course shared this with family and friends (of whom have bought vehicles there).  I continued over the past two years to take my vehicle to Paul and he always came through with superior customer service.  TODAY for some reason I did not work with Paul, even though I had an appointment with him.  A gentlemen greeted me at my car and I advised I had an appointment, he seemed baffled, and said ""you do?"" I explained that I was advised to be there at 7am for my oil change and state inspection and when they are done the technician will be in at 8am to look at my additional issues (that I have been in for in the past). So I did exactly that.  We walked inside to the computers and this gentlemen announces that I had an appointment as if in question. Someone else stated she is in under Eric, whom I never spoke to. The gentlemen continued putting my information in and asked if I was waiting. I said yes. He proceeded to inform me, ""you know you will be here all day?"" I said no I had not been advised of that. Due to the fact I could not be there all day or without my vehicle all day, I said I would have to reschedule the additional issues another day.  This gentlemen was not the friendliest of customer service personnel. I proceeded to the waiting room.  After reflecting back on this gentlemen's reaction to my additional issues he left the impression that these issues were of concern even though I had explained to him that I had it in previously and was reassured that it was nothing,  I returned to the gentlemen's desk and asked if they had a rental car that I could use I could keep my appointment and get this checked out.  He asked me if I had purchased my car there. I had not. He told me in a matter of factly way that since I didn't buy the car there I could not get a rental car. This was a surprise to me since I had several rental cars from there in the past, and I explained that to him.  Once again, matter of factly, he told me that since I did not buy my car there I could not receive a rental car.  He said the owner had changed that policy.  So I explained that was one of the main reasons I had been so pleased with Strickland and came there for service,  He did not seem to care,  I told him I understand he did not set the policies, but that was very disappointing to hear. First, I just moved to Pearland two years ago and I bought my car in Maryland 2010. I thought Strickland Chevrolet was MY NEIGHBORHOOD DEALERSHIP.  That I would receive the same customer service as any other Chevrolet vehicle owner, guess not!!!  I did not know in 2010 when I bought my car that I would live in Pearland many years later.  I returned to the waiting room, made a phone call with another competitor to see my vehicle and they advised up front that they would need my vehicle for the majority of the day, but not worry they could place me in a loaner car for the day so I could be on my way! I didn't even have to ask.  Appointment with competitor was booked while I sat there in Strickland's waiting room!!! Unfortunately, I won't be going back to Strickland not because I was told no, but due to the NEW POLICY that since I did not purchase my Chevrolet there I will be receiving the same benefits as other customers.  And YES, I called my family and friends to let them know that the customer service this morning was not good! They referred me to the competitor! To the owner.....bad policy!!!! ",1.8

A brand new car motor should not jerk !!! Finally, the check engine light came on - i called to get an appointment to drop it off and John Patterson answered ( i have had unpleasant encounters with him in the past so im not too fond of him). 
I did get some attitude because -his excuse for them not finding the problem is because the check engine light wasnt on. Well one would think that you would want to avoid that problem and fix the situation before it gets worse. Dropped it off and of course they fixed it thanks to the computer being able to tell them the problem. I do not trust your service department - i go back because i have no choice that were my warranty is. 

The other reason so you know why i distrust your serivce department is because i took the same car in for A/C problems back in november - same thing they could not find a problem - 3 days later A/C completely out. My husband looked at the car and he found the problem - took it back to your dealership to fix since it was due to an accident. So my husband had to do the work of your people that you pay  in order for your people to fix it. 

NOW the only good thing about your service department is RENTAL - THEY ARE AWESOME - ANDREA is on her job - she is wonderful she does not give you the run around and she takes control of the situation - SHE IS THE BOMB

When I went to trade my 2006 C6 which has competed and won at many events such as AutoRama for a new 2016 Stingray, other dealers simply had no interest and quoted a low ball trade. Strickland immediately noted the special care and quality of the car and went  above all others offering a fair price, noting the car's exceptional condition. The dealers prior support of a local Corvette club, willingness to deal fairly on the trade and the price on the new C7 along with ""non mega dealer"" atmosphere of the dealership make Strickland worth the trip to Pearland. If you are looking to trade or buy a Corvette, come here, seriously. Chuck Prosch will take proper care of you.",5.0

2534,"August 06, 2015","I recently had a new windshield installed in my 2006 Silverado Crew Cab.  Three days later I noticed that the installer who was not affiliated with Strickland Chevrolet had left a huge blob of black adhesive tar-like material on the passenger-side door of my truck which is also black.  Due to the fact that several days had passed in the July heat, the adhesive was baked on to the door.  I tried in vain for quite some time to remove it with a product recommended by a local auto parts store.  Unable to remove the material with the product recommended I chose to go to Strickland to speak with someone in the body shop to see what they might recommend.  There I met Body shop Manager Mario Martinez.  Rather than recommend a product Mr. Martinez got into my truck and asked that I drive him to one of the collision center bays.  There he proceeded to quickly and effectively remove the adhesive from my door and requested that one of his technicians buff out the location where the adhesive had been.  There was no evidence whatsoever that there had ever been a problem.  To top that, he refused payment and stated that he was just glad he was able to help.  This same truck was re-ended shortly after I bought it and the collision did an excellent job on the repairs.

2574,"July 30, 2015","I had searched the internet for a used, older model, four wheel drive Jeep we could use off-road to ride the pastures and check on cattle.  I was surprised to find what I was looking for at a large dealership like Strickland. They has a really clean 2005 model that was in excellent condition and, according to the salesman, had been completely serviced by their service center; fluids changed, engine, transmission, AC, brakes checked; detailed inside and out, good tires. The salesman, Chris, as well as the rest of the staff was professional and friendly throughout my purchase.  We negotiated the price with his management and I feel I got a very fair price for the vehicle. Well, I  revised my review of this dealership and salesman because of the following problems. I had asked the salesman for a copy of the service report since their service center checked the Jeep.  He said they did not have one.  On the way home from picking up the Jeep I noticed a yellow caution light on the dash.  I called the salesman about the problem and he said with was just a low tire light, check the air in the tires.  I also asked him about a second key for the vehicle because I realized they only gave me one.  He said they only had one key and I could get one made at any Jeep dealership. This was Wednesday.  On Friday I stopped at a Jeep dealership.  They scheduled an appointment to have a key programmed the following  Monday.  On Monday, the Jeep dealership said the tires were not low; the Tire Pressure sensor was bad and they also said the key could not be programmed because the Master Key Sentry was also bad.  Total repair costs, plus the new key, cost me $967.43 out of pocket.   I spoke to the salesman and alerted him to the problems and costs, asked him to speak to his management and see if they would reimburse any of the costs.  I never heard back from the salesman.  But, a few days later I did hear from the department manager.  Strickland negotiated what I feel was a reasonable compensation with me for the problems.  I knew I had purchased the vehicle ""as-is"" but, they realized the problems existed with the vehicle at the time of purchase,   It's great to see a car dealership have the integrity to do what's right!  So, now I have changed my review and ratings to reflect the great customer service I received..  Yes, I would buy from this dealership again!  And, I am enjoying the Jeep.",4.6

2645,"July 17, 2015","Went to Strickland to get what I thought would be an easy/routine oil change... the techs in the back had three unsuccessful attempts in getting the 427 on all three lift styles in Strickland's service area.  All lifts (even the brand new one for C7s) were simply too tall for the low profile of my C6.  That's when I requested Joey's intervention and had it not been for him, I really don't know what I would have done.  (probably would have left terribly mad).  This young man is intelligent.  He found the necessary 'accessories' (correctly sized boards) to elevate the lift-ramps so my 427's front carbon fiber ground effects wouldn't get damaged in the process of getting him on the drive-on lift.  Thank you Joey!  You are invaluable!  Just remember to stash those boards away in a corner with ""427"" written on them for next time. 
Many thanks also to Dreyton (sp?) who not only performed the oil change but also assisted in getting the 427 on and off the ramp.  Very polite young man, very meticulous, very careful to not get oil anywhere it wasn't supposed to be.  Every Corvette needs both Joey and Dreyton!  Thank you guys!",5.0

Our salesman was so nice and no pressure which made it so easy to enjoy looking at the trucks and trying to figure out which one better fit our needs and budget.

No lies and no surprises except for a lower payment than expected.  We had a great experience from the time we got out of our car to the time we left with our new truck.  Our whole experience took only two and a half hours.  Strickland Chevrolet now has our loyalty and our recommendation from our Salesman to Used Car Sales Manager to the Fiance Department we appreciated their professionalism.

After posting this review I was contacted by a rep and a line of actual conversation was opened. An amendment to the deal was made and I am appreciative of the efforts made.

Thank you.
_______________________________
First, this rating does NOT reflect that of the Salesman or Finance Manager I closed the deal with, even though, in his own way, the salesman was a contributor This rating is in regards to the dealership, its manner in dealing with an important matter, and blatant lack of care, concern or interest.

Second, if completing this survey results in having my credit run AGAIN... than I forfeit all aforementioned statements. 

If that statement makes no sense the read the rest of my story.

 It began with spotting a 2013 GMC 2500 Denali while in the area then stopping to see it and get some details. I was in a rush but asked KC about the price. I let him know that was more than I was willing to pay but should he be able to get it within the stated parameters I'd deal.

I watched the truck online and the day it came down to the price I liked on 1/12/2015 I called the dealership. Having not heard from KC and not being able to find his card I simply asked for an available salesman. Ryan picked up the phone.

I inquired about the 2013 Denali, asked if he still had it and if it was available to which he replies yes. After asking about current interest rates I gave him my information with permission to run my credit. He called back in the five minutes as promised to tell me I was all good to go BUT.... the 2013 GMC had a deposit on it and they had to hold it until that Saturday, if that party did not opt to buy it, it was mine. I mentioned the fact that he should have told me that BEFORE he ran my credit but to keep me posted.

That Friday, 1/16/2015, Ryan called to tell me the truck had in fact sold then tried to interest me in something similar with 40k more miles. I explained to him the problem... I now have a hard inquiry into my credit and no truck to show for it. I'm not going to jog around town having my credit run over and over so you sir need to find me a truck. I'm locked in to your dealership now and you should have told me about the deposit on the other pick-up before running my info. Now that you have, you need to go find me a truck. 

That was the last time I heard from Ryan.....

I found KC's card 1/18/2015, called him, filled him in and asked him to find me a truck. On the 19th I decided to drive BACK down to Pearland to meet again, face to face, and develop a game plan and explain my frustration. It just so happened that KC had located a 2014 2500HD that was very comparable with lower miles and I closed the deal that day.

The next day I returned to take delivery on the vehicle and drive it home. When I got home I got the notice that there had been a second hard inquiry into my credit. I immediately contacted KC and asked for him to get me an explanation. He informed me later that Ryan had originally run my information in the New Car Department (even though I at no point inquired about a new car) so when I purchased the truck The Used Car Department needed to obtain the information.

By now I am STEAMING!

I explained that these were internal problems, this is a screw up on the part of the dealership and Mr. Ryan. I was very clear during the paperwork process that my credit had already been run and asked several times if they would be doing it again. Each time I was told NO. I received a later update that no one was willing to do anything to rectify the situation because it involved two different  departments and one had no bearing on the other. 

Not one to give up I tried a different approach. on 1/27 I called Strickland and began an inquiry as though I were a new customer. Having been told that there were two Ryan's and neither one wanted to claim responsibility I asked for them both on separate occasion. First Ryan Crowder, then Ryan Rivera. Crowder handed me to Rivera and Rivera back to Crowder. Now this ""Ryan"" and I only ever did speak via phone on 2 occasions but if I were a betting man the money is on Rivera. Anyway, I digress.... The story I presented was that which I've presented here, they had my information, someone was supposed to find me a pick-up, and no one has called in a considerable while. I received a call back where I told Crowder to proceed with the shopping and once he found something, he already had my credit info so I wasn't offering it up again. This changed his tone. The next few phone calls consisted of me breaking down this problem for Mr. Crowder and offering him a free steak if he could help me sort this out. (I know Rivera handed me off, I know Crowder was being honest. What salesman hands off a 50k slam dunk sale at the mention of a my name? A guilty one!) The result; NOTHING! Each department says to call the other and they even went so far as to try to blame it on a salesman that separated from the company the week before. Touching on that note, as a business owner myself - know who pays the price when one of MY employees screws up? I DO! telling whomever is disgruntled that that individual no longer is here does NOT clear me! They are still MY customer and I have to do what I must. Strickland Chevrolet has done nothing, offered nothing, extended no olive branch, suggested no recourse or even went so far as to offer me a free steak to shut me up. 

Of course, why would they even need to try, they had made their sale and the damage was done

Had I known my credit would have been run yet again I would have sought out another dealership closer to home and denied these xxxxxxx the money!

The BBB, State Attorney General's complaint office and ever willing ready and able website will get this letter as a review.

If I am going to have my good name marked up then so shall the ones responsible!

The second time I scheduled an appointment early on a Friday morning.  By 4:30pm that day I had not received an update on my truck so I gave them a call.  I was told that it had not even been looked at yet and 'maybe' they would get to it on Monday.  I had informed the service advisor that morning that I would need the courtesy shuttle to pick me up when my car was ready.  At my phone call that afternoon he indicated that it was too late for the shuttle and I would just have to wait until Monday to get my truck if I couldn't find anyone to bring me to the dealership.

3260,"December 29, 2014","Every thing was roses until we backed out of sale of a standard LE1 camero. We made a honest mistake, wife hated the standard camero and so did I. (We made a uninformed decision, no test drive was given or offered) We asked if it was too late to back out, they told us no and not to worry about it. IF THEY HAD ASKED US TO KEEP IT WE WOULD HAVE!  

So we bought a auto camero 2ss demo with 6700 miles. Car was scrached and very dirty. Paint swirls are highly visible. They told us to bring it back for a detail. On the way home we noticed a head light was out. I guess no inspection was done on the car before delivery. Certainly no detail. 

Oh on that detail, words cant describe how awful of a job they did. Old dirt and spider webs literaly still on car. Water spots and all the scratches still visible. Paint feels like sandpaper - no wax applied here. So disappointed, wife spent more than 1hr waiting while im almost certain they did nothing to the car. At best scratched it more with a wet dirty rag.

Called the manager to express my disappointment and he made it worst by saying. ""Bring it back on a sunny day, let us redeem our selfs. We will give it a full detail instead of just a wash"" Confirmation that nothing was done, why waste our time we were told the car would be buffed, waxed and detailed?

Will take car to Ron Carter for out of pocket detail buff and wax. Also Ron Carter fixed my headlight and changed the oil. Yes Strickland did not even change the oil before delivery! (6700Miles)

My main complain is there attitude towards us changed, we became a burden instead of customers. (I guess i should have bought a corvette to be treated right). 

Trust me when i say worst car buying experiance ever. When a sales person has the gut to get in a yelling match with you the customer. And you the customer has to back down and lower your voice to not look like a ridiculous circus show. Nice way to end your day by the way, exiting a car dealer and having every one staring at you and your family. (Arguing about the ethics of the sales person)

There should never be a question about a professional entities ethics. The car waxing/buffing was but a minor item compared to the other 2 items I will not discuss on here.

3267,"December 23, 2014","I had visited a few dealerships since we wanted to get a Camaro now for my wife and a Corvette for myself in a year or two. And I had even visited this dealership a couple of times earlier this year, but I was disatisfied with the sales people that were trying to help me. One was rude and short, maybe because I was on my bike with my full gear, I don't know, but I walked away disapointed. The next time I visited, I felt as if the guy wasn't listening and just wanted to sell me a car at all cost. This time I met Diana who found a great deal for me in a vehicle that will fit my wife's needs and tastes. She took time to listen to what I wanted and showed me a car that had a great price and the posibility to be upgraded to my wife's desires. As I said, we did have to alter the vehicle with some upgrades, but once these are completed, it will be the car my wife has been dreaming about. And best of all Diana helped me find a vehicle that was well within my budgeted price.
Her supervisor was also helpful in explaining how the upgrade process will go and we were pleased with the timeline.

Eddie Wright was in the parking lot and approached me as I got out of my vehicle.  I was a little apprehensive as I wasn't sure how he would be at first.  Within 10 seconds, I felt very comfortable.  Eddie asked if I had come to see anyone specifically.  I joking responded by saying, ""Yes, the white vette.""  He walked over with me and immediately offered to get the keys and back the car up so we could get a better look (it had rained and there was some standing water around the car).  He asked me if I wanted to drive it and I said yes - of course.  On the drive, I told Eddie a little bit about what I had been searching for in a Vette.  He never tried to ""hard sell"" me.  When we got back, we talked a little about the numbers, but I wasn't ready to make a decision.  Eddie respected that decision and did not push me.  In fact, because he was so nice and genuine, it actually made me want to work with him more.  I ended up coming back and buying the Vette from Eddie the next morning.

3344,"November 11, 2014","We had been shopping mid-sized SUV's for at least 6 months trying to find the right fit for our family and we had driven everything from Mercedes, Lexus, Dodge, Mazda, GMC and Chevrolet (we never buy ford...ever).  We started comparing the prices of mid-sized to a full size (like Suburban / Tahoe / Yukon).  We called in and were directed to Jonathan Martinez. Within 10 minutes, we were headed to look and test drive something he had on the lot in our desired price range.  We recieved EXCELLENT customer service (as we always do at Strickland) and left there within an hour owning a new 2015 Chevy Tahoe.  The service department is HANDS DOWN the best in the area and we have utilized their services several times in the past for other vehicles/recalls/service etc.  

Strickland Chevrolet's Service Department and John Paterson are the reason we looked to Strickland for our new vehicle.....Johnathan Martinez is the reason we are driving a new Tahoe.

Relationships matter, and at Strickland Chevrolet, they make it a priority to build relationships, not just push a product.

3361,"November 03, 2014","Went in to trade for a family car, since we had just found out we are expecting.  We went close to closing time to just look so we woudn't be approached by salesman. However we met Carl. He was very friendly, and did help us. We set up an appoinment with him the following saturday to meet. I had went to a few dealerships before our appoinment to see my options.  We had already been preapproved thru our bank so we didn't have to wait all day in financing.  The next saturday we met with Carl, and he was nice, however he seemed to be over booking himself. We had plans that night, and what was supposed to be an easy fast deal lasted several hours. We were left sitting at his desk for over an hour while he helped another customer that showed up after us.  No one spoke to us during that hour. Until my husband approached the manager and was told Carl was helping another customer.  It would have been different if we were waiting on financing. We were already approved prior to coming to the dealership!!  5 hours later we left with a car. However was told to come back monday so they could finish the paperwork since the bank was then closed!!  On monday he called and said they had gotten us approved for a lower interest rate.  Which I now know is why we were waiting for hours. I then asked if  I could chose a different  car since it was a lower interest rate, and had found a nicer car. Not one paper had been signed at this point. We were told by Carl that no, we couldn't.  The car i have is a nice car, but if I had known what I know now, I would have chosed differently.  Carl was very nice, but I did not appreciate being left for an hour sitting at his desk with no explanation and no one approach us. He did apologize, and offer another detail of my car, but I missed the important plans I had scheduled so at that point it didn't matter. At that point I wasn't even able to get my car washed or detailed because the service people had left for the day!! If we had not made an early appt with him I could have understood, but we had pupopsely made an appt, and got preapproved for a reason!!! It is a great dealership, but I was not impressed with that aspect, and the fact that they gave me 2K less for my Jeep than other dealerships offered. If my husband had not been dead set on staying local, I would have went elsewhere.",3.4

I had my day planned out...I would visit and compare all three in same class 1 ton dually's (Ford, Chevrolet, and Dodge Ram) and most importantly compare how the Dealer organization would treat its customers with Price and Service.  By the end of the day...The Chevrolet Functions and Features for its new 2015 Silverado 3500HD LTZ won me over, and the Strickland Salesperson, Management, and Finance made the whole experience feel like a page out of Mayberry USA (Friendly Folks).

3426,"October 14, 2014","I had literally driven to just about every single Chevy dealership I could find looking for a brand new 2013/2014 Black Chevy Tahoe LT/LTZ. I even got desperate enough to check out Carmax but was highly disappointed when finding out that majority of their Tahoe's had over 20,000 miles and priced between 47k-56k. I had driven by the Strickland Chevy dealership twice. My first time dropping in I was greeted by Erika. She was extremely nice, and did not push or pressure me to buy or get anything else that  I was not there for. She LISTENED, she RESEARCHED, she kept me in the loop with what I wanted in their inventory. Unfortunately, the two Tahoe's they had at that moment on the lot wasn't what I was looking for. They were LS and not LT or LTZ. About 2 weeks went by and my goal was to find a Black Tahoe LT/LTZ by or before my birthday, I DID NOT AND DO NOT like the new 2015 Tahoe body style and had almost given up hope. I decided to drive by one more time and waaalaahh! There he was. Sitting in the lot waiting for me. A 2013 Black Chevy Tahoe LTZ with only 4300 miles as it was use as the floor model. Erika sat me down, we crunched numbers, I negotiated with both her and the manager, and came back the next day to pick up my Black 2013 Chevy Tahoe LTZ. The people here are super helpful, and I strongly suggest and recommend you ask for Erika. If you want someone who will LISTEN, pay close attention to DETAIL,  and WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU, and FOLLOWS UP go to Strickland Chevy and ask for Erika Vasquez! She'll save you money!

3434,"October 09, 2014","I took my 2013 Camaro SS in for an oil change. When my vehicle was finished there was oil on the plastic side panel, the floor mat, and the steering wheel. I reported this issue to service employee Eric Sullivan and he said he would take a look. While telling me what was clearly oil (I worked around oil for six years) was not oil he bumped my door causing my door to ding the trust next to me taking paint off of the truck and scuffing my door. When I pointed this out to Eric he denied doing it and said it was the wind (which wasn't blowing at the time) when I clearly saw his hip hit the door. While accidents do occur his bad attitude, denial, and making up excuses is unacceptable. He then rubbed the paint from the truck off my door and made no effort to apologize or rectify the situation. At this point I was fairly mad and felt it best if I just left so I said forget it and went to pay my bill. After paying my bill and getting in my car to leave I noticed that there was also oil on my shifter staining the threading. I went back in to talk to the cashier and informed her that I would like the oil cleaned and that I was disatisfied. She was understanding and said she would get me taken care of. Eric came in with paperwork from another employee and she began to tell him of my issue, she did not know he was the one I had spoken to as I could not remember his name at the time. He blew it off as she told him telling her that he had already spoken to me and that they were giving out free hugs if needed (he didn't see me when he came in the room) he was saying ""whatever I'll talk to him again"" as I walked to the cashier window to stand behind him and the cashier pointed me out, he turned and without even looking at me said ""let's go"". He then found an employee (Carlos) and instructed him to talk to me. I showed Carlos the door and the oil spots and he left to clean it. While I was waiting I overheard the technician who changed my oil telling another employee that I had complained about oil stains, motioned toward me, said ""he's sitting over there, yeah keep playing on your phone b*tch."" as I was texting at the time. The technician walked out to get another vehicle and I asked him if he worked on my Camaro, he said ""yeah"", and asked him if what he had just said was referring to me which he responded to with ""or what?!"" seemingly trying to antagonize me to an altercation. He then stated that no he was talking to some coworker, despite him talking about me, looking at me, motioning toward me, and describing what I was doing. I said ""fine, ok, thanks for changing my oil"" and shook his hand. I sat back down and a few minutes later overheard him again telling his coworker about my asking him if he had changed my oil and was talking about me. At this point I decided that I'd like to speak to the service manager Charles Kozel and informed the cashier so that he could be found. My car was then returned to me and Carlos did a great job; he buffed out the scuffing, cleaned the plastic, steering wheel, shifter, and shampooed the floor mat. There was still staining in the threading of the shifter but I figured that impossible to clear and was otherwise satisfied. As Carlos was leaving I saw Charles and asked to speak to him. I told him of the entire series of events and he apologized for the bad experience and stated that he would have meetings with his employees, though I somewhat suspect I was just being placated, but I could be wrong. Charles then came to my car with me to inspect the stitching on the shifter and said the only way would be to replace it and offered to replace it but I declined. I did not tell him why but it is because I don't want Strickland anywhere near my car again. At no point was there any attempt to lessen my $80 oil change bill or provide any kind of reparation other than apologies. I will never return to Strickland Chevrolet for any reason.",1.8

Well, the old trusted HHR completed it's ""long road"" of service and needed to be replaced this week so we returned to Strickland for a new replacement. Chuck Prosch was the person who sold this HHR (and many other vehicles) to us, so he was the one we wanted to see for the next one.   As many know Chevrolet decided to stop production of the HHR so a bigger decision needed to be made as to what next to buy. As always Chuck was a big help in showing what our options were and what the best price point for our specific needs would be.  

So a new Equinox LT was chosen next to continue the journey down ""the Long Road"" ...

After my wife and I  arrived to look at the car, the car was ready and waiting for us to take it for a test drive.  The car meet all of our expectations and was very nice and clean.  The price of the car was competitive with other cars that we were looking at, and our bank concured with the price. We traded in our 2011 BMW 535i and was offered the blue book value for our car. We traded in a very clean car and when asked why we were only offered blue book value, we were told that your dealership could buy a car just like mine at aution for that blue book price, well as a customer I can not buy that car at a dealer aution so you already have us at a disadvantage. You are using a sale technique that as a buyer we do not have. My wife and I understand that car company's need to make a profit but the consumer needs to feel that they are geeting a fare beal on their trade in. 
Over all we were pleased with our vist and the building was clean and the sale teem was professional. 
After we left with the car, we could not get the map lights to turn off so we headed back to the your dealership to have them looked at, David Zach had us drive right over to the service department and had the problem looked at. The problem was resolved and we were back on our way home. ",4.8
3580,"June 30, 2014","For some time I have wanted to get another Corvette, but felt at the present time they were just out of reach for me financially. Even the used vette's are an investment. So I lowered my standards to used corvette's. I found, or thought with the pricing I was seeing, my rang to select from would be in a year range of 1998 to 2002. I had noticed as I drove by Strickland's a blue corvette, but didn't know the year. Several nights later after work I stopped out of curiosity. That is when I met Howard Mena. As I was looking at the Vette I found it was a 2007 (much newer than I felt I could afford), Mr Mena asked if he could help me. I told him my desire and my situation. Knowing that would settle his need to help me. I also, told him I had sent in a inquiry over the inter net 4 or 5 days ealier, and had heard nothing back, so I just figured they didn't have anything they could fit into my situation. He said don't worry, if I liked that vette he would get me into it. How many times over the years have I heard that before.  Although he seemed very sincere, and knew what he was talking about, I finally agreed to give him a chance. The next morning at 11:30 am he called to get some information on my trade in, and asked several questions about my work, and income. Again I still had no hope of purchasing the vette.  THEN at 2:05 pm I got a message from him to come get my car. I thought it was a joke, because with the terms I told him at the present time I was in, I felt no one could get me a vehicle within the terms I laid out. So I called him.....In Fact (to my supprise he was dead serious). So today I am the proud owner of a 5 year newer Vette than I thought I could afford, and it has very very few miles on it (which also determines the value of that type car).  I feel my dreams came true due to..... The knowledge, and Experience he has a salesman, along with  his desire to get me what I wanted. I am sure it was due to his efforts, and not giving up, that produced the results that came about. Over the years I have met alot of car salesmen (I am 72).....yes they were friendly, but in a fake way. Not once did I ever feel Mr Mena, was fake. He projected a feeling not that he wanted to make a sale....BUT....he wanted me to have what I wanted. With all the obstacles I gave him to work with, any other saleman would not have waisted his time, but through his knowledge, hard work, and honesty.....he got me exactly what I wanted.
THEREFORE........
I have to rank Mr. Howard Mena......as the BEST automotive salesperson, I have ever met.  With his friendliness, knowledge, honesty, and never give up attitude.....""He is one of the best assets, a dealership can offer their customer's"".....my hat goes off to  MR MENA, and Strickland Chevrolet (for hiring this man to represent them). I will recommend that man to ANYONE.

I had been searching the internet for a GMC Denali XL for about 6 months. I saw Strickland Chevrolet had a clean, low mileage, GMC certified Denali priced within my budget. The only downfall was it was almost 1300 miles away. So aside from the photos posted on the internet by Strickland Chevrolet I had to rely on the honest opinion and description by my sales person, David. This was my first experience in purchasing a vehicle I was unable to visually and physically inspect and test drive. David provided excellent customer service. He took the time and answered all of my questions and took additional photos of the interior and exterior of the vehicle to ensure me the vehicle was in great shape. I took a step out on faith and purchased the vehicle. When the vehicle arrived to my house, it was exactly as David described and the photos depicted. My wife had no clue I had purchased the vehicle so when the vehicle arrived she was shocked and excited. (Can't keep her out of it). The vehicle looks and drives great and an excellent first time purchasing a vehicle over the internet experience.
I would recommend David Zach and Strickland Chevrolet to anyone who is in the market for a New or Pre-owned vehicle.",5.0

I was very interested in seeing what the new Corvettes looked like and felt like to sit in.  I spoke to a salesman by the name of Brett Curlee and he told me many things about the new Corvette.  And I found out that he also owned a 73 Corvette.  And his knowledge about the Corvette seemed extensive.  He told me about how efficiently air flows around the newer car to help keep it firmly planted on the road at higher speeds.  And how it can cool the engine bay and the brakes.  There were many other things that he told me about these cars.  Brett told me about the horsepower of the engine and how it manages that power through electronics, and even using a dual exhaust system to improve performance.  Over 400 horsepower in that car, I cannot imagine.  

Later while I was there Brett let me sit in one, that was awesome.  The new Corvette is light years improved over the older models.  I would have loved to drive one but did not want to chance taking it out and wrecking it.  Thanks Brett for telling me all the facts about the new Corvette.

3796,"March 19, 2014","A few months ago, reached out to my Credit Union and was approved for a car loan.  I was interested in purchasing a new 2014 Stingray Corvette.  The 'unnamed ' dealer I talked to initially informed me there was an allocated slot for a Z51 Stingray and my order would be placed in Monday of the next week.  I had not heard anything from the dealer for weeks, only to receive a call from the salesman explaining the slot was in fact not available and insisted I waited for one to become available.  Needless to say, I was not happy and told the salesman I would research for one somewhere else.  He explained to me, I would not find a 2014 sitting on anyones car lot waiting to be purchased due to high demand and I insisted otherwise.  After one minor google search, I found Strickland Chevrolet and called to hear ""we have a lot full of 2014 Corvette Stingrays"".  I decided to drive 1 hour from work to check out the inventory and was so amazed.  Not only did Strickland have the Corvette I wanted with the trim I wanted but the salesmen and saleswomen were awesome!  I was greeted by all who were available, offered refreshments, allowed to test drive as many of the Corvettes as I was interested in testing and last but not least my salesman Jason Green displayed his Corvette knowledge by answering as many questions as I could think of with ease.  Jason sealed the deal before I was sure which Corvette I wanted to take home.  I felt really comfortable with his mannerism, professionalism, knowledge and experience with Corvettes that I knew I was definitely buying form Strickland Chevrolet before signing a single document.  I was so excited to see the inventory listing that Jason provided me with all the available Corvettes, I felt overwhelmed!  That was just an awesome feeling.   Overall, Strickland Chevrolet is a very clean atmosphere, with an awesomely friendly staff, very accommodating and most importantly to some, fast!  I'd like to add, the Finance Manager who finalized my documents on the purchase was a very kind and positive spirited man! Made finalizing such a big purchase feel good! :)  

If you're looking for a good car, fair pricing, friendly staff, accommodating atmosphere... ""go to Strickland Chevrolet... and if the car you want is a Corvette, ask for Jason Green 'The Corvette Expert'!!!!""  

Thank you Strickland Chevy!!! 

I loved my experience as much as I love my car!!!

He was very straight up about getting me finance and knowledgeable of the information I needed to bring to the dealership. I had an answer by the next day that I was approved.

I had dealt with the other delership for about 2 weeks and here I only dealt with Mr. Ward for about 2 days max. When I got to the dealership, the car was ready. It was cleaned up and ready to go.

I had already new what I wanted which made it easier but I do have to say Cowboy Dave's attitude and personality was Great! He was straight up honest and took care of business. Can't say the discount on the Camaro was what I wanted but that was not Dave's fault. We were in and out of financing in about 30 minutes. Overall is was probably the best experience I have had buying one of the 7 new vehicles we have purchased. Thanks again Cowboy Dave and Strickland Chevrolet. We would most definately refer this dealership.

Unfortunately they did not have the vehicle I wanted in stock, however Mr. Prosch was able to locate the vehicle in the color and with everything I wanted on it in a surrounding state.  Mr. Prosch contacted the other dealer and made arrangement for a ""Dealer Trade"" and had the vehicle delivered the following day. The professional and friendly staff will keep me returning to this dealership for future purchases. I have recommended this dealership to several co-workers who have also purchased from them. ",5.0

3896,"December 01, 2013","Purchasing a new vehicle has always been one of the most dreadful experiences I've had. We were pre-approved and actually planned on going to at least 3 dealerships to compare pricing and rebates/discounts. Strickland Chevrolet was the second dealership we visited and we were pleasantly surprised when we met Andre. He was, from the start, professional and very customer oriented. Andre had all the answers we needed and worked with us to find the perfect vehicle for my husband. Andre went above and beyond what we expected. He made us feel like he actually worked for us versus the dealership, which really put us at ease. We intended on buying a 2014 Chevy Silverado LTZ and walked out with the 2014 Silverado High Country, which was made affordable after all the rebates and discounts Andre worked hard to get for us. Strickland Chevrolet beat our pre-approved rate and what we would have paid for a Silverado LTZ is basically what we paid for a Silverado High Country---which is a step up and oh so much more luxurious! We enjoyed this experience and were extremely satisfied with Andre, Scott (the accessories guy) and the whole dealership. Andre and Scott both also added a couple of extras for us that included tinted windows and a spray in bed liner at no additional cost. This is the absolute best experience we have ever had buying a new vehicle. No more worries...no more anxiety...no more being pressured into something we don't want---Strickland Chevrolet is the dealership we will go to from here on out. It will be my turn to get into a new vehicle soon and there will be no more going to 3 or more dealerships---it will be Strickland Chevrolet for me!! ",4.8

3898,"November 22, 2013","We chose Strickland Chevrolet because it's close to our home, and we believe in supporting local businesses.  We had previously used Strickland for service and had satisfactory experience.  When we arrived there was a porter near the front door who held the door for us and greeted us warmly.  Right inside we met our salesman, Mr. David Herzik, who was most courteous and attentive throughout the entire process.  He brought around cars that met our requirements so we did not have to walk more than we found comfortable.  He was also very forthcoming in pointing out the amenities of each style car and helping us with the comparisons.  Instead of merely looking at cars, we spent the entire day but in the end chose and bought a car that met essentially all of our needs.  We rate both the dealership and Mr. Herzik very highly. ",5.0

Also, John Parkey was a wonderful salesman to work with. He went above and beyond to make buying our new Chevy Traverse the best experience possible. He found one with all the options we wanted, and was very friendly and patient with our kids. He was very helpful, and showed us how to work all the different features of the vehicle. One thing I especially appreciated was the fact that he helped expedite the process so we wouldn't be sitting at the dealership for hours on end doing paperwork. I would highly recommend him to anyone looking to buy a new Chevy!",5.0

3902,"November 16, 2013","Experience is great as always.  David Herzik greeted us quickly on the lot and was very courteous.  David was very helpful,  he allowed my wife and I to have time to make a great decision on the vehicle we wanted with no pressure.  I already knew which vehicle that I was looking at, David pulled it off of the ramp, and let us take off on a test drive.  Strickland made the buying process real easy.  I say that because my Wife does not like the negotiations part of car buying.  But I had a number in mind and I feel that we got a great deal on a 2013 Suburban.  This is the 6th truck that I have bought from Strickland.  I have Twin Sons that will be driving soon and will need to buy 2 more trucks for them.  Strickland is definitely our family dealership and will be our first choice every time.  We will recommend Strickland to friends and family for their next vehicle.  Lastly David had made this experience the best one yet.  He was polite, respectful and will be the salesman that I look for the next time.

We talked to the Salesman Brian over 3 times in one day discussing finance and telling him that we are going to come in after work to sign the paperwork and pick up the truck, but then on the way over the salesman calls us back and tells us the quote they gave us was for another vehicle, even though all day long we had discussed the price for the original vehicle we wanted. During this conversation the salseman allegedly had a ""dropped call"", but then wouldn't answer the phone anymore when we called him back.

3931,"April 02, 2013","David Zach was initially very friendly when we were interested in purchasing a new vehicle. We made it clear to him how much we has to put down in adition to trading in our current vehicle. When we went in to sign the paperwork, he was not there and Brenda Sullivan took over. While waiting for her to arrive, we were apporached by another employee who immediately harrassed my husband that the sale should have been his becuase he was the first person to contact him via phone when he showed interest. The man left and we went outside, he came outside and continued to harrass us in front of our two year old! As soon as Brenda arrived, she immediately said we needed more of a down payment so we told her we were no longer interested. As we were getting up she informed us that the down payment would count as our first month payment, we went ahead and signed the paperwork only to be hit with an additional payment that same month. While waiting for the paperwork to print (which had to be manually fed into the machine and printed multiple times due to jams, etc.), my toddler was getting impatient and the employee stated ""when we are doing business like this, it is better to take the kids outside"" I was appaled! It was obvious that he did not want my child in there. Ally (finance company) informed us that we would have to take it up with the dealership. My husband contacted David Zach who informed him that in the paperwork we signed, it stated that we would have to still make a payment. The total price of the vehicle also totaled out to more than what David Zach had initially told my husband. I regret doing business with this company but we are now stuck with them.

3938,"April 27, 2007","This is long but an important lesson can be learned from this.  Hubby & I bought a new vehicle from Strickland a few weeks ago.  Salesman was very nice/helpful which is why I rated them highest in Friendliness.  However the Finance Dept is something else.  Hubby was quoted a price/payments & we took vehicle home while paperwork was drawn up (it was a weekend).  When he went in to sign papers the Finance guy told him an additional down payment was needed & payments would be almost $100 more than was discussed.  He also told hubby that GAP insurance would have to be added as it would appeal to finance company.  Hubby really wanted the vehicle so he signed papers (I was not there when the deal went down or it'd been a completely different scenario).  A few days later the signed copies come in the mail & I questioned hubby on some of the amounts (hubby was due a ""supplier discount"" because of his job).  Hubby called Strickland several times, left message to Finance guy but no one returned the call.  Hubby called GM 800 # & the rep also noticed the figures on the contract seemed odd (supplier discount could not be located on contract).  Pretty soon district managers were notified & THEN the calls started coming.  When hubby went it to speak to the Manager of Finance we were surprised to learn that the contract figures were changed:  our GAP insurance was removed & APR percentage was lowered.  Manager of Finance told hubby that the finance guy who did the paperwork was apparently trying to get incentives & flat-out told hubby that when they sell GAP insurance they get trips to Las Vegas.  They also get incentives for pushing the extended warranties.  As a ""sorry"" the Manager removed the GAP & lowered our APR but left the extended warranty alone, which was all in our favor.  Overall, I wish I'd been there to go over the figures w/a fine-toothed comb & question EVERYTHING.  We went there on a recommendation from a friend but it was not worth it!  Only the salesman was good about keeping in contact w/us even when things started to get ""hairy"" & told us to go back for a complete vehicle detail & full tank of gas.
