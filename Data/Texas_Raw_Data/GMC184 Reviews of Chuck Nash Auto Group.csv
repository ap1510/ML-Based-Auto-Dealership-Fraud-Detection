0,"June 11, 2020","I live in Iowa and saw a truck on Chuck Nash's San Marcos website that caught my eye. They had several pictures on their website but no closeups (other than the interior). I talked to the salesperson and told them that I would be flying down to pick it up and driving 20+ hours home and asked if there were any mechanical issues or dents/dings that I should know about and they assured me it was in great shape other than a little repair on a seat. So I flew down to pick it up. They did have someone pick me up at the airport, which was nice. When I got to the dealership they showed me the truck and it appeared to be in good shape except for a black wet and sticky spot (the truck was black too) about 1/4 inch by 3 inches on the side of the back quarter panel. When I pointed it out to the salesperson they said they had a big storm blow through and it was just tree sap. I thought about having them wash it again but I wanted to get on the road and knew I would be washing it after I got home as it would be dirty from the drive -- BIG MISTAKE taking him at his word. it was very busy and their finance guy was backed up so I gave them a $45,000+ check and signed some papers and hit the road and they said they would mail me my paperwork. I got home the next day and washed the truck and the glob washed off to expose a big scratch in the back quarter panel that was into the gel coat. They had put touch-up paint on it before I got there and it hadn't dried yet. I sent a picture to my salesman (who told me it was tree sap the day before) and he said that he would talk to the used car sales manager. He then called me back and said that they discounted the price to account for that. I asked him why they tried to cover it up instead of pointing it out and explaining it to me. He said they subcontract their prep work and they must have done it (but it was still wet paint when i picked it up????). So I spent $45,000+ on a vehicle and another $945 to have the scratch repaired and quarter panel repainted. And they said there is nothing they would do to offset the cost. I AM NOT A SATISFIED CUSTOMER! I would caution anybody who is buying a vehicle from Chuck Nash Auto Group if you are from out of state. Have them send you closeup pictures of the exterior of the vehicle before you make plans to travel down and buy one from them. I learned a $945 lesson.",1.0

2,"October 25, 2018","Just got back from another bad experience at Chuck Nash. Been trying to get my car fixed since April and every time it's a different person every time, but they same run-around.  Except last time I dealt with the xxx. customer service manager.  When my check engine light came on(again) I sent him an e-mail and heard nothing back.  I bring my car in 3 weeks later and he had no idea who I was or what was going on.  They just want my warranty to expire on the part so they don't have to replace it for free.  If you have anything wrong with your car DO NOT GO HERE!!",1.0
3,"October 25, 2018","I am very disappointed by the poor customer service received from Chuck Nash service department yesterday. The service rep was very unpleasant to work with, I know they are overwhelmed and overworked but I am your customer and I can choose to go any where else to get my car fixed but I choose Chuck Nash (for the last time). I was told I would be able to get a loaner since the repairs would take 3-4 days. When I arrived, I was informed there were no loaners available of course I was upset, the service rep told me he was going to double check and make sure there were none available. When he returned he told me “we have a loaner that we were holding for a customer that has been waiting for a week, but I guess we will give it to you”.  Really “you guess you will give it to me” I am going to pay Chuck Nash $2,500 to get my vehicle fixed and you “guess” I can use the loaner. The only reason I left my car there was because they had already started working on it. I have bought a couple of vehicles from them and Patrick from the sales team went above and beyond to get what we wanted. I have been pre-approved for my third vehicle but after yesterday I will not be purchasing from them again. The only reason I bought from them the last two times is because I have a family member that works for them. If they can treat me that way I can only imagine how others are being treated. ",1.0
4,"September 22, 2018",We paid $311 for them to charge ac. The receipt shows they tested it for leaks but next day no ac. When we called no one had a solution other than to pay more money to have it changed again! Looking for an honest mechanic currently. ,1.0

7,"November 21, 2017","My 2009 Cadillac DTS broke down by chuck nash I had my car towed to chuck Nash for service they informed me they could not look at it that day but would look at it tomorrow. 95.00 fee for opening the hood. I had to get a rental car and that was another disaster since I live 6 hours away and had to get back home for a real estate closing the next morning. When I got the quote the next day for the repair I was told 780,00 for the transmission hose and fitting. Since I had recently just had the same repair to another Cadillac I own and paid 166 for it I decided to have the car towed back home and have it fixed locally. I paid the 95 fee and had the car towed back and fixed with my local mechanic for 140 since the only thing wrong was a. Clip had come off and just needed to be replaced along with the transmission fluid. Seems to me that chuck Nash was ripping me off and I just wanted other people to know before they get sucked into this. They took advantage of my situation since I was broke down and far from home thought I would just pay their ridiculous fee to repair my car",1.0

10,"May 12, 2017",Took car in for airbag light.  They decided on their own to check everything else on car.  Claimed it had a leaking master cylinder into booster pump.  Wanted $800 plus to fix it.  I opted to have a second opinion done with another mechanic.  No leak or problem found. Chuck Nash fabricated a problem to rip me off. ,1.8
11,"March 06, 2017","The tailgate on the truck I agreed to purchase had been stolen but they conveniently forgot tell me before I got there. They swapped the tailgate for one that was from a totally different truck. It also had a scratch on the paint and on the oval ...AND one logo was totally missing, and the camera wasn't working!!! After I questioned them, they still didn't tell me...offered $150 credit for paint! HUH?!!!",1.0
12,"February 20, 2017","I had a recall for the front passenger airbag on my truck. I stopped in on Tuesday morning, set up an appointment for it to be replaced Friday afternoon.

I arrived a few minutes early and went to the lobby to wait the 4 hours I was quoted for replacement when I set the appointment. an hour later the rep, Ms K Reyes came to get me because they were ""done"" with it.

I was excited it was so fast and made I commented this to Ms Karina R. she then tells me they would call me once the airbag came in so I could set up another appointment. I had to take a day off work for this, I don't get paid if I'm not at work. I now had to take a 2nd day off, also without pay. I told Karina Reyes that I was not happy. when I asked why the didn't have an airbag for me knowing that's what needed replaced, she had no answer. I asked to speak to her manager, who was on lunch break

I went home, called the dealership, asked to speak to service manager. he was ""unavailable"".  I left a voicemail asking him to contact me so we could discuss this.  it has now been 2 weeks and no one has called me back

I went to another dealership in the area. I explained what happened. they set up an appointment and when I made the appointment, they swapped the deadly airbag

I would never recommend Chuck Nash Chevy in San Marcos, tx for anything, sales nor repair ",1.3
13,"January 30, 2017","Made an appointment last week to get my transmission checked with customer care. Came in Thursday and got my silverado back today. Frank the service manager was able to get everything covered with warranty, and I got a free car wash. Highly recommend, very friendly and efficient. ",5.0
14,"August 30, 2016","I had a warranty issue with a 2016 GMC 3500HD Denali. They diagnosed, and of course didn't have the part required. Scheduled service for today 8/30/16. I arrived and confirmed they had the part, which of course they ""did"". After 2 hours and 15 minutes of waiting, I was just informed that they DID NOT have the part. Of course they've already dismantled my truck, and now I have to wait for them to put it back together. Is the service manager completely incompetent? Why would you tear apart a vehicle without first verifying the part was available. DONT GO TO CHUCK NASH FOR ANYTHING. ",1.8
15,"March 21, 2015","I recently bought a used truck from Chuck Nash in San Marcos on March 6th.  I drove from North Round Rock, and  I spent $30000 and about 8 hours on getting this Dodge 2500.  It is an absolutely beautiful truck.  So what's the problem?  It has a leak on the back windshield.  With all the rain we have had lately my back seat, and the storage well underneath fills up with water.  

I was informed by the salesman who sold me the truck, that I would need to bring it in, and they would give me a loaner.  So now I need to spend my time, and gas money to take care of an issue that should never been there in the 1st place when they sold me said $30000 truck.  I informed the salesman by text that they should send a driver with a loaner out to my place here in North Round Rock, swap trucks, fix my truck, and then return it to me when it's fixed.  

Folks please don't get me wrong I love my new truck, but put yourself in my shoes and I'm sure anyone who has bought a $30000 would be pretty livid.  As I type this, I'm taking my truck to the nearest Dodge dealership where I will most likely be vehicle-less for the day, and most likely have to rent a car for work on Monday, as I was informed by dodge service that even though it was under warranty, they probably wont get to it today because they usually only have the oil change folks in on Saturday.  This has not been the experience that I would expect from a major dealership selling me a $30000 truck.",1.8
16,"April 27, 2013","I traded my BMW Z3 in on a VW Jetta Sportwagen TDI on April 6, 2013. David Johnson was a pleasure to do business with.  Although they did not give me what KBB and NADA said  the BMW was worth on a trade in, I think the final deal was fair. The owner's manual was missing from the VW. David said he would contact the previous owner and/or get me one from VW. So far,  this has not happened and he has not returned my calls. Once you're out the door, I guess you may be S.O.L.; I'll update this if they actually deliver as promised.",4.3
17,"March 09, 2013","Aaron was awesome! We went in to buy a Cruze, turns out we couldnt get the one we wanted but Aaron found us one that we could afford. His style was really laid back and never put any pressure on us. This made it really easy for us to make decisions and we felt comfortable the whole time. ",4.8
18,"December 18, 2012","Rick was awesome and easy to talk too. He was not pushy and I will buy a vehicle from someone faster if they are not pushy and let me take my time in making a decsion on a big investment. He was very helpful with any questions that I had and he kept the lines of communication open. He called to update me on the status as the transition was occuring. He also seems to make himself readily available after the purchase which I feel is highly important. Most sales reps that I have dealt with, don't seem to care after they have made the sale. Rick seems to be different as he always returns my calls whenever I make an attempt to contact him. He has done an excellent job in taking care of my new car needs and would I highly recommend him to anyone!
Thanks Rick!",4.8
19,"November 05, 2012",Dallas Bedell was very friendly and informative when we asked questions about the GMC Terrian and Acadia we were looking at purchasing. It was a tough choice to make but once we saw the GMC Terrain Denali it was hands down from there. We fell in love with it and purchased it. End of story.,4.8
20,"October 30, 2012","I purchased a used car from this dealership.  It was advertised as being in great shape, and the price was just about exactly what Kelly Blue Book said was a correct retail price for that car, that age, that mileage.  It was only a year old, and the price reflected ""excellent"" condition - i.e. no body damage, complete service records, etc.  When we got to the dealership (a fairly long drive) it turned out that the car had some dents and badly scratched paint on one side, that had been the subject of a poor repair job.  Not knowing better (not being a car guy), I assumed it would be a couple of hundred to fix, and got that as a discount.  Turns out it is $1,300.00.  I'm pretty sure that they, _being a car dealer_ would have known something like this.  So, I think I got hosed on the price.  

But wait, there's more!  Looking in the spare wheel well on the car, after getting it home of course, I find bits of broken safety glass.  That leads to an inspection of the windows and it turns out that the rear window is a different brand of glass than the rest of them (which were factory).  So now, I know that something happened to this car which involved breaking the rear window out.  My view is that if I found broken glass and then figured out about the window, then the dealer would have found broken glass and figured out about the window.  It was not disclosed.   

After two emails complaining, I got a call back.  The second one threatened to go to the Better Business Bureau, so it seems they only respond to threats.  Of course, when I was exchanging emails about buying the car in the first place, I would get responses immediately.  No surprise, really, but still disappointing.

In any case, I was given the ""we sold it 'as is'"" line.  Of course, that's true, but they probably sell every used car ""as is"".    

So, bottom line is that I believe they are happy to take advantage of their customers, sell their used cars for too much and laugh all the way to the bank about it.  Then, when the customer is mad about it, they'll only get back to you if you threaten to take more serious action about it.  

I would not shop there again, and I would tell anyone else considering shopping there to avoid this dealership.",2.3
21,"October 16, 2012",Mark was pleasant and handled sale great.  I wasn't looking ot buy at that time but he sold me anyway.  It was a pleasure dealing with him.,4.8
22,"September 19, 2012","It was a ""no pressure"" experience.  I told Rick what I was looking for and he showed me all of my options. He was friendly, made sure we understood what our options were and made sure we got the correct vehicle at the right price.  It is the best experience that I have ever had at a dealership. 

Johnnie was very pleasant and explained in detail what we were signing and the costs of purchasing the vehicle. He made the experience very pleasant.",5.0
23,"September 01, 2012","I have been a customer of Chuck Nash since 2002. Have had much service work done there with not one compliant. The service people, in particular Jimmy Castillo, are friendly and helpful. My salesman for the new car I recently purchased was Rick Satterfield. Rick demonstrated all the functions of the new car and could not have been more attentive to my specific needs. He also knows his product! I will return to Chuck Nash for any future automotive purchases.",5.0

John Wells did a fantastic job of helping me to achieve this goal as well and I am truly grateful for the wonderful service and great care that both employees took in helping me make a decision and finding what was best for not only me but my budget and needs at the time. They are fantastic and I am ever so grateful and have told anyone who would listen about the great care I recieved at Chuck Nash.,5.0
27,"August 07, 2012",Chuck Nash Auto Group was a pleasure to work with.  Melissa did an excellent job with selling me my new vechichle and answering all the questions I had.  Johnnie Phillips was great with the financing.  these two combined for an overall great car buying experience! ,4.6
28,"July 31, 2012","Buying a new vehicle is a really exciting experience.  Buying a vehicle from Chuck Nash and Mark Crayton has made the experience even more enjoyable.  Marks' personality, knowledge of the sales process and his knowledge of the vehicles being discussed make him excellent person from whom to buy your next car. I am proud to say that Mark is a longtime friend of my family, and receives high marks from all of us.
 Thanks also to Regis Musabika, Finance Director and Elva Zdeb, Customer Relations for their help in the sales process.  ",5.0
29,"July 13, 2012","Melissa introduced herself and immediately started showing us what we wanted to see.  She was very outgoing, putting us at ease.  I think what stuck out was that we were looking at cars and despite the fact that it was close to closing time, she did not rush us.  She would tell us about each vehicle we looked at and then she would compare it to another model.  She definitely knows her vehicles!  
We also worked with Regis (Finance man).  Even though we didn't spend much time with him, he was very informative on the financing.  He was very courteous and patient.
I can truly say that our vehicle purchase was a breeze  and I would recommend people to go to Chuch Nash and see Melissa.  ",5.0

31,"June 30, 2012",I've visited most of Austin's dealerships wether it be in person or online and Chuck Nash has the most friendly professional employees by far. I wanted to get the best deal and save the most money so of course I shopped around. I always bring my vehicles to Chuck Nash for servicing so I was hoping that I could find the best deal there too. When my wife and I came in for a test drive we met Rick Satterfiled and he told us everything there was to know about the Chevrolet Equinox. My wife and I decided that we wanted the Equinox some time ago because it's the best SUV for the price. Rick explained that he would mach or beat any offer that we got from any other dealership and he did. To make things more complicated we had been involved in an accident with our current car just a week before and were waiting on the insurance adjusters to approve payment. They took that into consideration and gave us the best offer for our trade in as it was wrecked. I really don't think there's anything they won't do to make sure you get the vehicle you want for the best price. They didn't have the exact vehicle we wanted in our first choice of color and there was one available at another dealership. We went to that dealership to try and get it ourself and found out exactly how bad some other dealerships are. We were back at Chuck Nash the next day and they found the vehicle in our second choice of colors and had it on their lot that evening. Rick kept in constant contact with us and made himself available when he was at work and while he was not. From the start Rick made sure we got the best treatment and in the end he got us the best deal. Chuck Nash is now and will be our preferred dealership. If your worried about pushy sales people you won't find that here. The atmosphere is very laid back and everyone seems to be happy to work there. All departments are housed in one central location so you are able to talk to the sales and service department together within feet of each other. I highly recommend Chuck Nash and Rick Satterfield for your next automobile purchase. If they don't have it on the lot they'll get it for you quick and and the very best price.,5.0
32,"June 23, 2012","My wife and I were very comfortable working with Mark Crayton. It was a great experience and now we are at two Cruze family. Thanks for all your support and help, Mark. Keep up the great work. We hope to convince others to come and see you. By the way, Barbara wanted to know if you got her that golf cart yet.

Thanks..

33,"May 31, 2012","I recently purchased a 2012 Terrain from Chuck Nash from Michael Averitt. I had a wonderful experience and am thoroughly satisfied and love my new car. The first experience I had purchasing a vehicle 6 years ago was at a different dealership and it was not a very good experience and I felt taken advantage of. So when it came time to  purchase a new vehicle I had a lot of reservations about having the same bad experience. I was pleasantly surprised though. From the very beginning Michael and Cameron were very honest and genuine and they soon put my nerves at ease. I really felt like they had my best interests at heart and were not just trying to make the best most expensive sell. I also feel like they gave me a very fair price on the purchase cost of the new car as well as my trade in. Michael was also very attentive at showing me all the details and inner workings of my car, and even made follow up phone calls to see how my new car was and if I had any questions. I would highly recommend Chuck Nash and Michael Averitt to any of my friends and family, and will continue to be a customer.",5.0

We got a really good price for our trade-in and they worked with us on negotiating the final price and agreed to re-tint the windows to our liking.

39,"May 08, 2012","We had spoken to Elva a month ago about the GMC Terrian.  Elva explained all the features at that time and we were very impressed with the vehicle.  When we finally sold our RV and no longer needed our Chevy pick-up to pull it with, we called Elva for an appointment.  We test drove several terrains and picked one out to buy.  We had only so much money to spend so our budget would not fit into the Terrain.  Rick got involved and suggested the Chevy Equinox.  Since it was the same basic car on the same frame we test drove it and fell in love.  We have had it only one week and have filled up with gas twice averaging 35 to 40 dollars instead of 80 to 90 dollars with our diesel.  We are averaging 36 MPG highway and combined city/highway of 26 MPG instead of 16/17 MPG average with our diesel truck.

41,"April 30, 2012","The service was great and Aaron did a good job of working with me. I came in looking at used 2006 Mini Cooper S and was trading in a 2004 Mini Cooper. After test driving the 2006 Mini I noticed the Chevy Cruze next to it and looked at a few of them and the price was just $100 more for the 2012 than it was for the 2006 Mini, so I changed gears on him and we test drove the Cruze and I liked it and was impressed that it would actually get more MPG than the Mini, so we did the deal.  My only issue would be that I think my Mini was worth a little more than what they gave me for it as trade in on the Cruze. I had put about $2500 worth of repairs into the car in the last 12 months I owned it and it had low mileage for a 2004 model at roughly 58K but overall I am very happy with my purchase. ",5.0

44,"April 26, 2012","We received a letter from Chuck Nash inviting us to come into the dealership to see what we could in regards to selling our 2009 GMC Acadia back to the dealership for a new car. We are repeat customers having purchased our Acadia there. 

Both my wife and I were skeptical as to leaving there with a new vehicle and I thought this was going to be a waste of an afternoon and evening!
 
We were immediately, and graciously, met by Dallas Bedell, a total professional, who answered and anticipated all of our questions and concerns (of which we had very few). My wife and I have purchased many car in our 16 years together and we came away not feeling that we were taken advantage of and actually loved the total sales experience for the first time ever mostly due to the care that Dallas exhibited throughout our time there. 

I'd direct anyone interested in one of your products to Dallas for the same good care and experience. He is a people person! We left there in a couple hours with our brand new 2012 Silverado truck and plan to enjoy it in the years to come.

Would we recommend Chuck Nash to our close circle of friends and family in the area? Totally, without reservation!
Will we be back again to buy another vehicle for daughter when she turns 16? Without a doubt!

You have earned our business for as long as we remain in Central Texas!",4.8
45,"April 25, 2012",Alex Webster was selling his personal car through Auto Trader but writting the deal through Chuck Nash to save money.I talked with him 3 times on the way to the dealership which was 125 miles away only to have him Sell the car out from under me 30 minutes before I got there. Very unprofesional and no ethics. Did not offer any apologies nor did he try to even sell me a car from their lot. I was out a half of a days work and $85.00 in fuel for nothing.,1.8

47,"April 23, 2012","This is my 2nd purchase at Chuck Nash auto group. The entire staff was very courtious anf friendly. The only dissapointing thing about the whole deal was that Chevy did not have any incentives on the vehicle that I purchased. Which is no reflection on the dealership. I appreciated the no pressure environment during my visit. I encourage the dealership to keep Rick and Johnnie in their employment in that as a costomer I feel they are a valuable asset to The Chuck Nash Team

48,"April 17, 2012","Our experience buying a Equinox was exceptional.  Dallas was extremely helpful and stayed after closing time along with Johnny Phillips to help us drive away that evening in a new Equinox.  The next day I had to return to make sure the vehicle was inspected and Dallas came in on his day off the see that all was done correctly and go over the ins and outs of the new car.

After a couple of stops to some other dealers with not so pleasant sales reps, we contacted Chuck Nash and found exactly what we were looking, and for a great price.  The finance department took extra care in getting us the best interest rate and deal for our money... the interest rate was half of what the other dealers were quoting us!  Dallas was easy and fun to work with and knew exactly what I was looking for.  I would absolutely recommend the Chuck Nash team to all my friends and family.

It was my sister and I (female) and 2 children shopping. Every dealer we talked to either didn't take us seriously or wasted our time or ignored us completely. Dallas was immedialtly responsive, helpful with us and the kids, answered all our questions, and found us the perfect vehicle within 5 minutes of our arrival. He was honest and he stayed over an hour after closing time to meet our needs. He went over and above all of our standards and I was happy to buy a car from him.

65,"January 18, 2012","This car purchase went the way it is supposed to go, stress free. There was zero pressure to buy the car at any time and Elva was very knowledgeable about not only the car she was offering but she also knew a lot of information about the other vehicles we were considering. 
I did a little research, made Elva an offer and it was a done deal. She even put a huge red bow on the car when we came to pick it up which made my wife very happy. Elva spent a lot of time going over the features of the car instead of looking for the next customer. Elva was the only salesperson that we spoke to out of four dealerships that was determined to find the mocha colored Equinox that we wanted and it even came with accessories that we thought were out of our price range. Everyone at Nash offered to answer questions for us, we even got a tour of the service department. If you dread the normal experience of buying a new vehicle give Nash Chevrolet in San Marcos a shot and look for Elva.

This is the way buying a car should be!
First of all, I shopped online for 3 weeks and Chuck Nash had the lowest miles used vehicles for the best price, hands down.
Other Dealers in San Antonio were asking the same price for vehicles that were 1 year older, with 21,000 additional miles on them.
My salesman, Lee Hicks was so easy to work with.  It was well worth the drive up from San Antonio to purchase this vehicle.
Lee had the car sitting there ready to go the minute I arrived, and he let me fool with the stereo system ( most important aspect of the car for me ) for over 15 mins before we even took a test drive ( It was a Low Miles Buick, so you know it is reliable, the only real thing to check out is the radio system and cool inside features ).   We literally spent over 30 mins just checking out the inside features of this Buick Lucerne.   I felt like a kid in toy land.  

Not one time did I have to deal with or even speak to a sales manager.   There are no sales games or gimmicks going on at this place.   Ken worked with me to get the payment exactly where I needed it to be and no more.   The finance manager took elaborate time to explain to me all the warrantee plans in great detail.   I never felt rushed.   

I would recommend this dealership to anyone!  Easiest car buying experience ever! ",5.0

Tom Bauer the sales representative didn’t disclose of any of these problems and I bought this car.
  
 When car was delivered to me I found a lot of rusty spots. I made pictures of these spots and sent them via email to sales manager Mike Beshom. After having no response to my email for about two weeks I call to Mike Beshom and he promised to talk to the owner of this dealership and call me beck. In about a week I have called Mike again and he asked me to take car to body shop for estimate for fixing these damages.. Next day took car to reputable body shop.

 Estimate of $3,710.33 I sent to Mike Beshom. Having no respond to my email for another few weeks I call Mike again and he said that they could pay me mach less then this estimate. I asked him to send me a written offer to solve this dispute but he refused to do this.

This problem is remain unsolved.

3] I have called about the rear view camera feature not active but have yet to get an answer.
4] The only reason I bought this car at this dealership was because it had the features I was looking for and the pricing was less then other dealers I had worked with to date but certainly the price was much higher then the Chuck Nash Web site pricing.
5] Financing offered very few options or competitive rates.  I was easily able to find a rate on my own for 1% less then the Chuck Nash offer.
6] After being at the dealership for quite sometime, I was never offered anything to dring or even told where to find something to drink.
7] Computers went down and was unable to finish the transaction in person.

Good Part:
1] Car was delivered to my home so it saved me a return trip.",3.0

Therefore my yellow Camaro with hockey stick stripes is awesome.  Tim and a woman in the service department (Deloris maybe?) were both excellent and very helpful.

The only area I was a little concerned with is that it took longer than I thought it should have to run the paperwork to purchase the car.  The business representative very good, but the purchasing process could be streamlined a little.

I've purchased a truck and a Camaro at Chuck Nash and will buy again if needed.

It was a pleasure meeting you the other day. As I mentioned, I purchased 2 vehicles last week, and 1 in January, for a total of 3 for the year from your dealership. I have also recently purchased a 2010 Jeep Wrangler and a 2010 Ford King Ranch, for a total of 5 new vehicles this year to date. As a Business Owner, I appreciate positive feedback. I know you do as well. I must say that your salesperson, Mark Kuebel, is one of the best I have ever dealt with. He is articulate, direct, knowledgeable, mature, and a very pleasant individual to deal with. He listened to what my needs were, and offered informed responses. The most frustrating thing to deal with is a salesperson who does not listen. Mark not only listens, but he is also calculating an answer as you are asking the question. Sharp guy ! Purchasing vehicles typically can be an exhausting, time consuming process, but with Mark Kuebel it was quick and to the point. He knew I was looking for a fair deal without any of the games played by many dealerships. Mark Kuebel is the reason I keep coming back to Chuck Nash Autos, and I look forward to doing business with your dealership in the future.

I have been a customer of this dealership since 1977 and have purchased 15 vehicles, mostly through Ben Gonzales.  My overall impression of the dealership is outstanding.  I know that I will be treated fairly when I purchase a vehicle and that when I need service, I can always rely on honest, helpful treatment.  Chuck Nash, Jimmy and Ben are the reasons I continue to purchase vehicles from Chuck Nash Auto Group.",5.0
175,"August 17, 2010","Great service! This was our second new car purchased and we are very pleased with the service provided by both Lee Hicks and Johnnie Phillips. We would not hesitate to recommend this dealership to others for sales and service.

176,"August 14, 2010","We traded our vehicle in for a used SUV and had a great experience at Chuck Nash.  Lee Hicks was very friendly and patient with us as we explored different vehicles and financing options.  There was never any pressure to rush into a decision, and Lee even provided us with loaner car while our newly purchased car was prepared for us to take home.  We absolutely love our SUV and are so glad we chose Chuck Nash.  Lee Hicks was authentic and friendly.  If you are in the market for a new or used vehicle, go to Chuck Nash and ask for Lee.  You will be glad you did.",5.0
177,"August 14, 2010","I was in the market for a new vehicle and drove as far as San Antonio to look for a Chevrolet Malibu. I live in Austin so I went to a couple Chevy dealers out here, went to San Antonio, but that dealership only had new Malibu's, no used ones. On the way back from San Antonio that evening I passed Chuck Nash's dealership. Since it was already closed for the day I went back the following day (Friday, 13 August 2010) to look around. Alex helped me right away and I told him that I had a trade-in and that I would pay the rest in cash that day if they gave me the vehicle I wanted at the price that I wanted to pay. I gave them an offer for my vehicle. I wanted 7500 but they gave me 6800 but that was a good value considering my vehicle was only worth $4000. I test drove the 2008 Malibu and I fell in love with it. I told Alex about the other experiences I've had with the other dealerships and how I obviously had no luck. He said to me, ""well, if I can get you that car with a 7500 trade-in and 10,000 including tax, title, etc., would you buy it today?"" I said yes, because that's exactly what I wanted to pay. Well, long story short, his manager took a look at my car, drove it around and gave my a trade-in value of 6800 (its a little more than that but i dont know the exact number). The manager, Alex and I played the price-negotiatiating game a couple times and I got what I wanted. I was so happy. The only thing I wish they could have done was fill the tank up to the same amount of gas my trade-in had, which was 1/4 short of a full tank. They gave me five gallons, but I would have been more happy with more. Anyway, Alex and I took a picture next to my new ride and after he helped me transfer my belongings from my previous car to my new car, I hit the road. It still doesnt feel real, then again, I had the car for less than 24 hours. I screamed on while i was driving because I was so happy. I appreciated how they competeted with the other dealers because they beat them and won my business. ",5.0
178,"August 13, 2010",Since the early 1980s I've bought all my cars from the Chuck Nash dealership in San Marcos. I has always been a pleasure to go in for service and be warmly greeted by Service Manager Jimmy Castillo. Even though I've recently moved to New Braunfels I preferred to drive back to San Marcos this week so that I could see Jimmy again. He is a real asset to the dealership.,5.0
179,"August 12, 2010","I have only left my car with the service writer - Jimmy, for the past 30 years. Where he goes, I go for service. He is great in communicating with me about the needed service and will let me know about progress. He makes sure I get good service. Jimmy is a great interface with the public for Chick Nash. With Jimmy as the service writer, I feel confident that I'll get great and fair service.",5.0
180,"August 11, 2010","Mr. Costillo, as service advisor, has taken care of four vehicles over 13 years- always with integrity, very good advice on what to do (and not do).  Mr. Costillo is the reason why we purchased 2 vehicles from Chuck Nash Auto and wny we keep coming back.",5.0
181,"August 09, 2010","Chuck Nash Chevrolet out of San Marcos has been great to our family!  I have purchased my last three vehicles from Lee Hicks, sales associate there at Chuck Nash.  Not only does Mr. Hicks have a positive attitude so do all the rest of the employees we worked with during our sales.  They will always try and work with your financial needs to make the sales deal work for you.  I would highly recommend Chuck Nash Chevrolet dealership and ask for Lee Hicks if he's available.",5.0
182,"July 31, 2010","Year 2010. I went in for an oil change and was charged $10 more then the special that was advertised on the sign at the entrance regardless of me pointing it out. The service advisor insisted that it was wrong.... after the work was done. I had an AC belt replaced and my Tahoe came back running badly. It was running great when I brought it in and I was told not to worry about it by the service advisor. He told me that it was running bad because it was just washed. I demanded it be fixed right and found that a vaccuume hose was disconnected. The advisor treated me like I was an idiot.I told him that it was unprofessional to treat customers like that and he continued to do it rather than apologise. I originally signed up for the rewards program only to receive constant emails showing that I earned no points. When I told them to take me off of the program because the emails were overwhelming and always wrong, they told me that i had enough points for a free oil change, but they were only good for a week. I received those points because I had just gotten an oil change. Why would I come back in a week for another one. How aggravating to be sold on perks only to find out that they were no good. I emailed two managers trying to address these issues and no one responded. They get a 2 for friendliness instead of a 1 because at least they smiled while they were sticking it to me. This dealer has lost my business for good despite how close they are to my home. The real shame for them is that I will be in the market for a new pick up as well as a new Tahoe with in the next two years. I'm going back to Capitol Chevy in Austin. They rock.",1.8
183,"July 27, 2010","Rather than try to sell me something I didn't want, Bob Wilson worked to locate the precise car I wanted and set me up in a loaner until my car could get to the dealership. He was courteous and professional the whole time with none of the slickness of other dealer's sales staff. The offer for my trade was fairly negotiated to my satisfaction and everybody left happy.
