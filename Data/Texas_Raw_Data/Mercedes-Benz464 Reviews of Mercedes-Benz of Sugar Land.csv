We originally looked into shopping at Clear Lake and after a poor experience, we decided to go out to MB of Sugarland. We walked in with no appointment and ended up purchasing a GLC that day. Kenneth was so helpful and patient during the entire process. He’s so friendly and was excited about the process and was never once pushy. I was nervous for my first buying experience but thanks to Kenneth, it was such a breeze. Highly recommend!",5.0

2,"January 26, 2020","All of  the employees were considerate and offered help at every turn. Pete Sanchez was the salesperson we dealt with. He keeps his word. If he promises you something, he delivers. He knows the mercedes line like the back of his hand and listens to what the customer has to say -- pretty rare at a car dealership. Overall, a very enjoyable experience and we wound up purchasing a certified pre-owned vehicle on the first visit.",5.0

4,"July 18, 2019","Approximately four months ago I took my 2013 S550 4Matic (60K miles) into this dealership for a hard jerking during acceleration which caused it to go into ""limp"" mode. Once there the service advisor Cedric Milton proceeded to sell me on other service products other than being concern about the main malfunctioning issue. 

Proving my observation and seemingly rolling the dice for diagnostics Mr. Milton call me to pick up my automobile. When I arrive I paid $2k for regular service maintenance and my warranty company paid for the alleged repair in the amount of $4874.00. Not to my surprise, I had to return to the dealership three days later for the same jerking issue. My vehicle was kept again for over a week while they continued to roll the dice on diagnostics. This time they charged my warranty company $7814.78 I picked my automobile and was only able to drive it for only two months before it started doing the same jerking and stalling. So, after they allowed my warranty to expire without fixing my problem and to prevent them from having to warranty their previous repairs, Mr. Milton now informs me that my original jerking  issue was not what they repaired, but a separate issue which now cost over $9300.00 
 
 It's amazing how they expect me to pay for their incompetence. This is the worst dealership I've ever visited. A clear case of extortion! I'm actually embarrassed to own a mercedes-Benz ",1.2

6,"April 01, 2019","One of the BEST car buying experiences ever. I went in on a Monday at 1:40 pm and was done signing my deal by 3:02 pm!  The sales team consisting of VP Sales Sean S., Sales Assoc. Pete S. Delivery Specialist Sara A. , and Finance Mgr. Anil S.  were the most professional TEAM assembled. After being told by Sandy at MB-Greenway, I was disliked by PJ their Sales Manager, this sales experience was refreshing. They were HONEST, FAIR, PATIENT, and ATTENTIVE of my needs. The Team, answered all questions, explained the process, and kept the buying experience professional. I love my new 2019 vehicle and I would highly recommend MB Sugarland! I was treated with respect and dignity just as the “guys” purchasing their vehicles were treated. As a female, your car buying experience shouldn’t be intimidating or overwhelming; this is the store where all Females are afforded the same car buying experience as Males. Clients won’t endure high-pressure sales tactics, falsehoods about pricing, and condescending dialogue; what you will receive is the type of car shopping experience you deserve. I highly recommend the MB Sugarland Store for all your vehicle purchase needs. For “inner loopers” like me the drive to Sugarland MAY seem like a world away but I can assure you it’s worth the drive. The Store has more of a FAMILY feel to it as opposed to a major corporate car dealership only interested in moving units. Save yourself the hassle and stress of “wondering if you’ll receive a fair deal” at other dealerships and make the drive to Sugarland, it’s worth it. You will be greeted with a smile and you’ll drive away in your new vehicle with an even bigger smile! ",5.0
7,"March 27, 2019","I had a awesome experience here at Mercedes Sugar land. 

Terra Kurtz (Superb Sales Agent)- Very kind patient and understanding. I felt really relax through out the process and making a deal with her.  She's a very professional sales agent!  Thanks again Terra!  

David Lefkowitz (Sales Supervisor)
-Really awesome! I should say very straight forward and willing to understand clients! 

Dawn Villareal  (Finance Dept) 
-She has a positive vibe when you talk to her. She'll explain things very thoroughly  and she wont force you on things that the client doesn't like.
-She's really nice! 

Chris Mazloomi (Delivery Specialist)
-Very detailed when explaining gadgets and  how to use items inside the car.

Before I had a bad experience with car dealerships  but when I met this team in Mercedes-Benz of Sugarland it was a fast relaxing process. 

Again thank you  for the experience!

Hope you look for these guys!",5.0

11,"December 14, 2018","Been shopping for this car for a while. Saw it on line on their site. Mercedes benz of sugar land Texas. Called and spoke to a Luis. We talked about the car, told me it was a ten, just came in off lease, was purchased from their dealership and serviced, asked for a carfax to which he sent me one, was very nice all along. I asked him multiple times if there is any issues cosmetic or otherwise, he assured over and over that the car was a ten with 12328 miles. No issues whatsoever. I trusted luis(big mistake), he gave me that salesman speach that he had been there for 20 years, he sends cars all over the country and especially to Florida which is the final destination of the car. I should have known better, I wired the funds, he sent the paperwork and still very nice to deal with. I received the car filthy on an open transporter, keep in mind it’s a 77k car. Covered with dust and cars transported above it. The driver dropped it, handed me a paper to acknowledge receipt of the car, I could see scuffs on two wheels which I noted on the sheet and one key when I was promised two.
I had a Detailer ready to wash and detail the new car. After cleaning, discovered 4 spots on the hood, the size of a dime each where apparently some liquid leaked from the cars above and ate the paint on my beautiful new Mercedes. Exactly an hour later, I took pictures of the damage and sent it to Louis. To make a long story short, Louis turned into a different person after he got his commission and would not follow up nor was interested in taking care of my problem. With daily follow up calls, He kept telling me that his manager is handling it and that the owner of the transport company was going to call and set up an appointment to inspect and take care of the damage and not to worry since they have been using this company for the past 15 years. I never heard from any manager nor transport people. A week has gone by, I called today and was brushed off with a total different story, now I have to call the transport company and deal with the situation. During the conversation, he pretended not to hear me and hung up, never called me back. STAY THE xxxx AWAY FROM THESE CROOKS AND ESPECIALLY LUIS SALAZAR. I am going to call Mercedes bens of North America, better business bureau and the state attorneys office and file a complaint about these people. STAY AWAY FROM THAT PLACE.",1.0
12,"October 04, 2018","I dread car shopping; but, Kenneth Hughes at MB Sugarland made my buying process stress free and easy.  After months of shopping, I knew what make and model car I wanted and could have purchased at other dealerships in the area; but, decided on MB Sugarland due to Kenneth’s professionalism and knowledge.  He guided me through every step, was responsive to every question, and got me the car I love within my budget.  Thank you for an enjoyable process.",4.8
13,"September 25, 2018","They could not fix a minor issue on my G63 after keeping it for 3 weeks.  After 3 weeks, manager Steve Stojack lied to me about it being fixed.  I went to pick it up only to be told by the shop foreman that it was not fixed.  In short, completely useless, worthless bunch of liars.  Do not take any car there, especially not a higher end MB.  Also, all of these 5-star reviews that appear professionally written are fake.  Do not believe them.",1.0
14,"August 14, 2018","  I am completely appalled at the lack of customer service and unethical behavior of this dealership.  Let me list just a few things that have happened during my 15 months of buying and owning my GLC43.

It all started with us signing a contract on a blue GLC43 that was in New Jersey.  Two days later we were informed that they could not get that car.  Interesting since we already signed a contract and why did it take two days to say they could not get the car when they assured us the night we signed the contract they could.  They then told us they would give us a great deal on the GLC43 that they had there.  We agreed on a price and bought it.  About 5 weeks later I had an issue with the windshield wiper, and brought it in and had it fixed.  The next day my ESP light came on and the car kept slowing down.  When I brought it in they again could not duplicate the problem but after contacting Mercedes they replaced a part on the transmission.  It was in the shop from May 3-12, 2017.  On December 7 I bought the car in for a problem with tires skipping when turning in a tight radius.  Again they had my car 6 days and then I was informed that this happens with the summer tires in cold weather--interesting it took 6 days to get that answer.  Then again a few days later my infotainment screen would not light.  I had to take it back for them to change the screen out.  I then brought it in Mar 20 for my one year maintenance and a problem with the brakes jerking.  Again they had the car for 4 days.  Interesting thing is they changed my oil and used 8 quarts of oil but owners manual says my car only needs 6.9 quarts with the oil filter,  another little discrepancy.  I received no mention of my tires getting worn and might need to replace them soon.  I took my car in on June 28 for a recall to another dealership-West Houston Mercedes.  They informed my that my tires needed to be replaced after only 10,000 miles(interesting that in 2000 miles my tires went from fine to totally worn out).  Then July 7th I had the problem with the ESP light occur again only this time it was worse.  The front brakes totally locked up while we tried to get the car 2 blocks back home.  By the time we got back home the whole front end was smoking.  The dealership came and picked it up on a flatbed.  Of course they test drove it and they could not duplicate the problem.  After 3 weeks in the shop, Mercedes USA says the car is performing as it should.  I find this totally ridiculous since the brakes were locked up for 2 blocks.  I understand the car should slow down if it feels that the car is sliding for some reason, but that does not explain why the brakes were locked up.  Even though the dealership could not duplicate the problem, the tech said the brakes were discolored so he knows that really happened.

My next problem is the dealership had asked if they could put on diagnostic equipment and test drive my car.  I agreed since I do not know how else you would diagnose the problem.  My real problem is, after I got the car back, I found out that my car had been on the toll roads while it was supposed to be at the shop.  When I asked the dealership about this, I was told the service manager took my car home a couple of nights.  They never asked about this and I would have never agreed to this.  I find this totally disrespectful to take a customers car to a private residence and use the tollroad for your personal use.  

Even though Mercedes USA claimed the car was performing as it should, they decided to give me a good will gesture of new tires.    I did agree to get new tires because I had decided by then just to trade the car in because I feel it is unsafe and I will not put my life at risk for Mercedes.  I had asked if I was going to get run flat tires, since this is what I was told was on the car when we purchased it.  I was told that the car doesn't have run flat tires.  When we purchased the car I had asked about the spare tire.  I was informed it didn't have one, but the car had run flat tires.  Now after a year I find out it didn't have run flat tires so I am glad I never got a flat since I would have kept driving on it.  Another unethical business practice--lying to your customers.  The service manager then told me I should have a tire kit in the trunk.  I looked for one and informed him that I did not have that either.  Then he looked it up and told me that it was an option for the tire kit.  Seriously, Mercedes sells a $68,000 car with no spare tire, no run flat tires and no tire kit either?  That makes me feel that Mercedes could care less about its customers and just is concerned about their bottom line.  Obviously Mercedes USA does not stand behind their cars.

I had the tires replaced on August 2.  I did not even get the car home--less than 5 miles--and the tire pressure light came on.  Are you kidding me?  I had to drive back to the dealership AGAIN.  After they looked at it, they decided the tire pressure system needed to be calibrated.  Seriously, why wasn't this done when they changed the tires.

I could go on about how Mercedes Benz Sugar Lands customer service at the service center is terrible, but I think I have said enough. I have bought a competitors car(that has a spare tire), unfortunately some other unlucky person will end up buying this GLC43 and I am sure will have similar problems.

15,"June 15, 2018","We were looking to buy our first Mercedes. We were searching for a GLS450. We had been to a couple of dealerships in the Houston area and were disappointed in the lack of interest and willingness of the salespeople there. So, we called the Sugarland location. We talked over the phone and Kenneth Hughes found just what we wanted!!! Wow! It was in Georgia but that was ok. We drove over an hour to the dealer to discuss the price and was impressed and pleased so we moved forward had put money down and signed all the papers. The SUV should arrive within 5-7 days, again that we ok. The next day we got a call from the salesman that the vehicle wasn’t available asters all!!!!!???? It was a demo. We had also been talking to a salesman in Fort Worth who saw this vehicle listed but it said, “do not call” so he figured it wasn’t available to tell us about it. Wow!!!!!!! This was a foolish mistake!!!! They should have called the dealer who had the SUV in Georgia to confirm it was there and available!!!! We will NEVER go back! We also had to finally call the finance dept to ask about getting our check back because Kenneth didn’t reply to my husbands email. ",1.0

17,"March 07, 2018",Went here to buy a new Mercedes. I wanted a new GLS 450 was willing to order a new one in order to get exactly what I wanted .  They told me it would take 6 months and a $2000 deposit as well as I would have to finance the car there. The sales person took my name and went to the sales managers office and he came back and said he couldn't sell me a new GLS 450. I couldn't believe a car dealership didn't want to sell me a car!! I left the dealership totally devastated and not understanding why Mercedes-Benz would not sell me a GLS 450. I called my salesperson who would not answer my calls he finally sent me a text stating he could sell me any vehicle but not a GLS 450. After many unanswered calls back to the dealership my salesperson finally took my call I asked him for the name and number of person at Mercedes-Benz that said I couldn't order a new GLS he said I would have to talk to their attorney and I said no problem please give a name and number and was told he couldn't do that so than I asked him to have the GM call me.

20,"January 18, 2018",This was the worst experience of my life.  My first as well as the last Mercedes-Benz I'll ever purchase.  Took my car to this dealership for servicing.  I had just purchased my vehicle 3 months prior to servicing.  My car was returned to me with ten year old worn out tires and rims.  Front leather seats were replaced with worn out leatherette (fake leather) seats.  I was charged close to 800 for labor costs on an hour and a half work.  These people have absolutely no integrity.  Will smile and steal at the same time.  The sad thing about it is because Theft by Deception is so hard to prove....it will most likely continue to be a regular practice at this particular facility.

23,"September 13, 2017","Stunned...the only words I have after wasting a month dealing with Mercedes-Benz of Sugarland. That being said I now completely understand the class action lawsuit against them for discrimination and bias. 

I had spent nearly a month with my fiancée shopping for the right vehicle for our blended family and landed on what seemed to be the best fit for our (at times) family of six. The vehicle we were replacing was her Infiniti QX 56 coming off lease at the end of November so we had some time. We had shopped at Sugarland as well as one other Mercedes dealership to do our due diligence (I work in Venture Capital). I had developed what I thought was a good relationship and strong rapport with both my salesperson David and the sales manager Sean so we decided unreservedly we would give our business to Sugarland, they had earned our trust in what we hoped would be a long-term relationship and lifetime customer equity as I at that point was also interested in acquiring a sedan to replace my Land Rover. Being between model years of the 2017 on the 2018 we found it difficult to find a vehicle that was within our budget and had the features we wanted and didn't have things we didn't need (like the parallel parking package that cost $3000 which seemed to be on most of the vehicles we were shown) so we felt it best to work with our sales person and build our own vehicle, which we did. After several visits we sat for an hour with our salesman building a vehicle the way we wanted it and were asked for a deposit that we gladly paid. My fiancée was ecstatic as this was a dream vehicle for her (she is German) as well as it was my gift to her. Two days later we were called and told they would not sell us a vehicle, no explanation, just that they would sell us a vehicle. I was stunned, I had never heard anything like this in my life nor have I ever been handled like this or dealt with so unprofessionally by a business. Mercedes-Benz really needs to think about how their dealerships and they deal their customers and potential customers -- this was simply rude and arrogant as apparently I wasn't the ‘right customer’ to own this vehicle. 

This is been one of the greatest time wasting experiences I can recall and it was handled incredibly poorly, I have lost a month and I am now back to square one and I'm now faced with a much more onerous time constraint. I do want to congratulate Sugarland for selling another Infinity extremely effectively…kudos guys! Oh and where do I sign up for that class action suit.",1.0

I have no hesitation in recommending Lars & his colleagues.

26,"July 06, 2017","I recently purchased a new SUV from Mercedes-Benz of Sugarland.  I was there on the last day of June and the selection on site was slim, however the salesman showed me what they had and none of them were what I was really looking for.  He quickly got us on the computer and found exactly what I wanted.  We negotiated a fair price and we completed the transaction in 30 minutes.  The next morning the car was brought to my home.  It exceeded my expectations with more bells and whistles than I had bargained for.  I couldn't be happier with the sale or the service.  Great Job!!!",5.0
27,"May 04, 2017","The worst car buying experience I have ever had!!! I was threatened, harassed, bullied and frankly treated like a criminal. After ordering a car and waiting over a month for it to come in, Joe, my salesman who wasn’t in a hurry to do anything except collect my money, called me and informed me my SUV would be in, in a week, but I had to come in and pay for it in advance and if I didn’t come in the next 72 hours, it would be sold to someone else, again, I had ordered it and put a deposit down on it and I did mention it WASN’T even in yet!! Oh, just wait it gets worse, I get there having had secured financing from my credit union at a great rate, only to be told I couldn’t finance through my credit union, I could ONLY finance through Mercedes Benz at a considerably higher interest rate. I am quite sure this is not only unethical, but illegal and is considered “steering”. Yes, I watched the movie and my attorney might have mentioned it. I was very saddened by my experience at this dealership, being a woman I felt pushed in a direction I wasn’t comfortable going in, I was told on two different occasions if I didn’t do what they wanted I would lose my car, it wasn’t what I expected from Mercedes at all and I would NEVER recommend this dealership to anyone. I would NOT want anyone to ever feel the way I did! 
",1.0
28,"May 02, 2017","Is Mercedez Benz PREJUDICE? I was approved for an SUV through my bank. However; the sales agent informed me that it is a requirement to finance through them. In regards to the ""steering law"" attempting to force a buyer to finance through the dealership is ILLEGAL. I work too hard to be judged on my ethnicity and comprehension. I never thought I would face this type of discrimination in 2017 but then again this type of steering lead to the housing bubble in the early 2000's. 

I seriously considering filing a police report to have on file documenting my incident I have experienced because I am sure I am not the only person receiving this unbelievable discrimination. I am sure any civil rights law firm would be very opinionated on how I was treated.  

Do not give this dealership your business!  I guarantee you they won't even care that I post this review nor do I believe they will take the time to contact me and make this right. I plan to call the better business bureau.

In the beginning of May, I ended up ordering a GLS 450 from the manufacture in Alabama, the reason for ordering the SUV, the GLS 450 they have at the dealership was not in my budget or it was over loaded with options that brought the price up, however, my sales guy called me and they had a GLS 450 at the dealership to the exact specification to my order with the same cost. My response was... yes I want the vehicle, and everything was great until I received the second phone call from my sales guy. He told me that there is a name exactly like mine on the Mercedes Export list from Bloomfield New Jersey, in this case this person has nothing to do with me. I am a Petroleum Engineer with 26 year in the business and I do not have a clue what exporting a vehicle entails.

I took the car there and told them my struts needed to be replaced, an alignment needed to be done, that my wheel was smoking, and some lights were coming on. I was told I needed to replace two back struts, get an alignment, to replace bellows, and that my wheel was NOT smoking. I agreed to the $4,348.16 repair. I picked the car up on February 23 and literally 3 miles down the road the same light (the light is a symbol of a car with an arrow pointing up) came on... I later took the car back and was told the reason the light came on is because my compressor went out. Both Brian and Steve Stojack told me after I had the service done, that there is a possibility that other parts can go out when you get this type of job done.

Why wasn't I told this prior to me making a decision on whether it was worth getting my car repaired or to just go ahead and sell it? At one point Brian Don even told me ""We're not your financial advisors"".

HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. LITERALLY WORST SERVICE AND CUSTOMER SERVICE I HAVE EVER RECIEVED FROM A COMPANY. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE MOSTLY HAS TO DO WITH HIGHER UP MANAGEMENT SUCH AS BRIAN DON AND STEVE STOJACK",1.0
41,"March 21, 2016","I was recently looking to purchase a vehicle for my daughter and had a strict budget.  Naturally would've thought that a Mercedes dealership would be too much for us.  But I was surprised to find an pre-owned SUV that fit my budget.  I contacted to store and was help by Luis and we set a time to come in and look it over.  Long story short, we ended up purchasing the vehicle and away we went.  Shortly afterwards the radio started having issues and I contacted the store.  Mr. David Bohn the Used Car Manager was prompt and listened to my issues.  He set up a time for me to bring the unit in and of course when we arrived the radio was working fine.  He assured me that if for any reason it acted up to please let him know.  I was scared at first and brought it up to him that what do I do if it breaks a month from now.  He assured me he knew of the issue and just to let him know.  Well sure enough a month later it quit.  I called him expecting him to brush me off and hear that I had bought a used car...Not only did he tell me to bring it in immediately, but they ordered a new radio and fixed it without hesitation.. He has also called to check up on my daughter a few times since.  I truly appreciate him not only taking care of the issues, but remembering us and not treating us like a number.  We now feel like family there and will be telling everyone we know that YES you can afford to buy a car from Mercedes-Benz of Sugar Land... ",5.0
42,"March 10, 2016","I cannot say enough good things about this dealership and in particular Frank Kelske.

I have now purchased 2 x cars from him and this dealership and they have been looking after me for the last 3 years. Frank's professional and personalized service made both of my purchase experiences very comfortable and enjoyable - you know you are working with someone you can trust and who really understands what you are looking for. He is also great at making sure your ongoing experience with the dealership is first class and everything you ever need is taken care of (every single time!).

I should also add the service department is very well run and the Asst. Manager Michelle Ward is fantastic - she is very knowledgeable and extremely helpful. Her advice and help makes ownership decisions very easy and add to the ownership experience of the car/s. She has always looked after my wife and I - this is truly appreciated.

This was my second service visit with Don. My first visit was for a windshield replacement and Don had the windshield ordered and installed in less than 3 business days (It would have been even less time but it was during the Labor Day holiday weekend).

47,"January 24, 2016","Having bought a MB Sugar Land CPO C-250 for my daughter, which was very much a gratifying experience, I knew that I wanted to return to MB Sugar Land for my next purchase. I wandered into the showroom looking for some assistance.  Dave's warm and welcoming invitation was an important detail that this dealership stands for, no matter what the opportunity. Then Dave took it to the next level.  He was spot on with locating and bringing the MB Sugar Land CPO 2015 C-400 I was interested in. I had spent months on my own studying and learning the details in and out on this versatile and well-appointed vehicle with many options to choose.  The 2015 C-400 is not an easy to find gem and especially with the high-value appointments and options that I was looking to purchase. I was really impressed with Dave's command of the key factors that make this such a highly rated vehicle that has received many positive and glowing critics' reviews. He focused on providing clarity around the details that helped me originally focus in on this opportunity and was even kind enough not to rush me through the evaluation.  He even let me tune up the Burmester sound system with its drilled speaker grills throughout the vehicle and we enjoyed the ""S"" Class Level experience. He worked closely with me on my final negotiation and even made that a great experience.  Hats off to the MB Sugar Land family, and Dave especially, who actually know the real meaning of a valued customer relationship.  It was such a pleasure to go in and talk to a laser-focused Executive Sales Representative who had knowledge, customer performance focus, and common sense.  A rare commodity these days, especially in the automotive experience.",5.0

70,"October 06, 2015","In August 2015, I ordered/built a 2016 Mercedes CLS400, with the help of Frank Kelske with Executive Sales at Mercedes-Benz of Sugar Land, TX, 281.207.1585. I came to MB of Sugar Land and Frank through carprousa.com, after a less than stellar sales experience at another Houston area Mercedes dealership , a dealership, with whom I had been a good customer for many years.  

From the minute I made contact with MB of Sugar Land through the carprousa.com portal, it was one pleasant surprise after the other.  First surprise.  I had no sooner hit the send key to an email, agreeing to be contacted by MB Sugar Land, when an email hit my inbox from Frank!  Immediate response?  Who does that nowadays?  And thus began, the “love affair” with Frank Kelske and Mercedes Benz of Sugar Land.  Honest, fair, professional, friendly, responsive, lacking the stressful sales tactics of other dealerships and fun, that’s right, I said fun, describes my customer journey with Frank and the team at MB of Sugar Land. 

The entire car buying process was painless, fun and exciting.  Frank kept me updated throughout the 2 month build.  Again, who does that?  “They’re starting to build your car today.”  “Your car is built!”  “Your car is on its way to the Port”  “It’s at the Port in Germany waiting to be assigned to a ship”.  “Your car is on its way to the East Coast!” “Your car is waiting to be assigned to a truck to take it to Sugar Land.  It should be here in 2 days!”   “Your “baby” is here!”  

And then there were the inevitable “negotiations”, for which there was really no need, as the trade-in price offered and the final cost of the car were fair right out of the gate!  Another most welcomed surprise.  And, it gets even better. I had my 2006 CLS 500 appraised for one amount during the first visit, at which time, Frank informed me when I return to pick up my new car, because I didn’t leave it with them at that time because I needed to drive something, the actual trade in amount could be different, pending mileage and condition at the time of the trade-in.  Sure enough, when I returned to pick up my new car,  the trade-in amount was indeed less BUT, because I came to Frank through carprousa.com, and the car was in the same condition as the original appraisal, except for some minor additional mileage, MB Sugar Land honored the higher appraised value!

So what was it like to buy a car through carprousa.com and Frank Kelske with Executive Sales at Mercedes-Benz of Sugar Land?  The best ever!  Would I recommend starting with carprousa.com and having the pleasure of doing business with Frank and Mercedes-Benz of Sugar Land? An unequivocal ABSOLUTELY!  I look forward to a long relationship with Mercedes Benz of Sugar Land.

We instantly became a fan of the brand and the environment. He built trust and accepted our request of what we were looking for. I have been shopping for a car and have noticed many dealers are always trying to rush us into buying a vehicle without giving us the in's and out of what they have it offer. When I buy any vehicle, for any family member, its usually a family decision. I can say, Cesar definitely was able to accommodate our family decisions during the buying process. We are very excited to have this new vehicle to join our family. We are already looking into another Benz to add to our growing collection! WE definitely recommend Cesar Moreira for any car buying experience!!!",5.0

We come back for:
1. Up to date relevant inventory,
2. Quality/Clean show-room, 
3. Helpful and (not pushy) sales folks,
4. Efficient processing whether in sales or service or parts, you don't have to sit in a cattle call to conduct your business.

Also worth mentioning, and most important..... no funny car sales games... no gimmicks, tricks, dissappearing ink.  I trust my MB of SL reps.

We dealt with Frank Kelske the first time and was so please with his help and knowledge, so I went back to him. There was never any pressure just honest help with my decision making. I explained what I was looking for and he was able to help me find my dream car.  He answered all questions and was a pleasure to deal and talk to. He was always patient and helped me to relax and enjoy the experience. I decided on a CTS 550 and I love my car.

106,"March 20, 2015","This is my 4th Mercedes but the first at MB of Sugar Land. I was referred to Frank Kelske by name and he was up to the billing. I was told that he was a straight shooter and would give me a good deal and overall performance. I dare say that he went above that. I traded in my old GL-550 for a new one and worked had to get a good value for it. When what I wanted was in stock, he got me into a loaner car right away and worked real hard to me exactly what I needed without breaking my back. All through this we were having conversations either in person or over the phone as if we'd been friends forever. I'll definitely steer friends his way because I found that the first friend who gave me his name was right on the money about the man's integrity and friendliness. I will pass this on. Good job, Frank. It was a real pleasure working with you.

And how about Nick Bartimmo in Finance? He turned the table on my when I breezed in thinking that I had the best deal in town and he blew me away. I ended sign up for more services than I had originally planned because he gave me good deals on the various options and thoroughly and patiently explained to me under what circumstances they would come in handy. I mechanically added some of them in last vehicle but this was the first time I fully understood the usefulness.

It looks like MB of Sugar Land is full of stars whose reputations precede them. When I mentioned to another friend that I was going to MB of Sugar Land to shop for a replacement GL he told me to ask for Paul Tamas by name to my service manager. He told me that he trusts Paul implicitly and so when I picked up my vehicle I asked for him and was taken to his office. He sounded like a very friendly chap who knew what he was talking about and I hope to have years of good association with him.

Overall I can say that this association between me and MB of Sugar Land is off with a bang. Although I occasionally used them in the past for service I didn't feel any loyalty since I didn't buy my vehicles from them and it was just a matter of convenience. Now that I picked up a new vehicle from them and with people who were referred to me by name having lived up to their reputation, I'm going all in and will spread the word wherever and whenever I can.",5.0

My car was at the dealership for 8 days, there was no communications at all until I called and emailed my service advisor regarding the status of my car. When I got the car back, I was told by the cashier and advisor that 13 miles were put on to my car, which is what is shown on the service invoice I received. 13 miles is a bit much but I understand that sometimes they need to do some road tests and make sure the problem is truly gone, so I said okay and signed the paper. I was shocked when I got into the car, I found out close to 200 miles were put onto the car. No clear explanations from anyone why the invoice says 13 miles were put onto my car when in reality they put 200 miles on it. I have spoken to the service director and he basically laughed at me and said why would anyone drive my cheap C300 when they have $200k+ cars here to drive. It doesn't matter how much my car is worth compare to the other vehicles at the dealership, I bought it with my money and I want it to be taken care of.

I was never pushed or pressured in buying a car which puts you into ease since I wanted thorough answers with my type A personality. My Mercedes buying experience was by far the best since I have owned BMWs and Lexus. I am a forever Mercedes buying because the detail and effort Mercedes-Sugar Land puts behind their employees.

I was very disappointed when the vehicle developed a mechanical problem a few weeks later and required several days in the Mercedes shop for service.  The service department did a fine job in correcting the problem, but my level of confidence in the vehicle was much diminished.  While I realized intellectually that there would likely be no repetition of this issue, the long-term reliability of the vehicle became a concern.  Ultimately, I just didn't really real like I still had a ""new car"".

After I explained my concern to Frank, he offered me the option of selecting a replacement vehicle.  He was able to locate a second new vehicle that is identically equipped to the first.

223,"January 29, 2014","It’s simple – when you walk in the first thing you notice is ‘Class’. Employees dress well, employees behave well and yes, they sell well. You enter this beautiful building and you get greeted right away. Something the other dealership lacked. 

To start, I visited this dealership for the first time on a Monday holiday. The door was opened, I saw someone and I let myself in. Even though he said ‘sorry we are closed’ he added ‘but, is there something you’d like to know?’ and he went on to dedicate one hour of his free time to help me answer questions. From that point on forward it was a smooth ride. 

Half way thru the deal, my sales rep had to leave town for training and passed it on to another sales rep; she was just as nice and helpful; so much so that I ended up buying the car after all. 

They were not so lenient when it comes to dealing, but their service, promises well kept, and just the overall experience was worth the extra mile (And dollar).

Before giving my issue one last try to be resolved, I had taken my car to have the front end fixed five times.  I went to the Greenway dealership four times and the North Freeway once.  Each time, my car came home unfixed.  
 
From the moment I met with Randy Els, who had Dario test drive my car with me in it so he could hear the noise for himself, I was very impressed by the warm and professional atmosphere of this dealership.  Everybody treated me so kindly (something I didn't always encounter at Greenway).  And instead of giving me a stripped down loaner car, the car I was given to drive had a sunroof and satellite radio.  It made the mere 24 hours I had to drive it a pleasure. 
 
Not only did I get my car back a day later (instead of days later), Dario was able to fix the problem.  For the first time in years, I am able to drive a car that feels and sounds like a luxury car.  As I checked out at the cashier's desk, I admitted that I had been so disillusioned with my experience until now, that I wasn't considering another Mercedes for my next car.  However, because of the extremely positive experience I had with your service department, I will definitely be making a visit to the dealership when the time comes to buy another car.

We live in Bellaire, so we went to visit the Greenway Mercedes dealership, and were very interested in the Mercedes GL 450.  After evaluating the Lexus, Cadillac and all other luxury SUVs, we decided to buy a GL450.  We visited the Star Motor Cars dealership as well, and returned to the Greenway dealership.  We talked with 3 different sales associates at these two dealerships, and never had a returned call from any of them.  It was strange – we’ve never had an experience where we were more ignored than when we talked to these two dealers.  We were told in the dealership that GL450s were hard to find, but that both dealerships had several available.  However, neither dealership ever even followed up to let us know about the cars that they had in stock.  It was very surprising and disappointing to us, and our time was running short.
So, we started calling other Houston and Texas area dealerships to try to find a vehicle.  Other dealerships were slightly more responsive, but then we talked to Maria Haller.  My husband and I have bought a number of cars in the past, and Maria is by far the most professional and responsive sales professional we have met.  She listened to what we needed, was tireless in her dedication to finding us exactly the car we wanted, and sent us option upon option for a vehicle.  She didn’t ever suggest that it was too hard, or get frustrated with us for changing the options many times, or suggest that since these vehicles are in high demand, that she wouldn’t help us.  We were so relieved to know that good sales associates DO exist.  We purchased our car from her, and absolutely love it.   We intend to point all of our friends and relatives to her as well, and can’t recommend her highly enough.

227,"January 09, 2014","This place is SUPER NICE and the employees are AWESOME. They found my dream car and I still cannot believe they found it. It took Mr Stan Smith 1 day to make this happen for me. I purchased a 2012 CLS 55 AMG black on black. They got me financed in 1 hour, a 95K car in 1 hour!!! I tell all my friends that this place does magic. This sounds weird but I work from home and I leave me house once or twice a week and my wife was always complaining that I never leave the house. I now leave the house 5-6 times a week so I can just drive my car around and I actually go to the dealership and drink coffee 2-3 times a month. The employees are SOO nice and the coffee is great hahaha. I will buy my next car from them, it is just such an amazing experience. The finance dept was also nice, I told Mr Harry what I want and what I don't want and they didn't put any pressure on me and they respected my options. A++++

228,"January 09, 2014","My husband and I went in on Saturday morning simply to have our new plates installed.  All we can say is ""WOW""!   Each and every time we have visited Mercedes Benz of Sugarland we are treated so extremely well.  Although we visited the service department, Maria Haller took care of everything for us, so unfortunately, we don't recall any service employee names, but they too are all outstanding!

When we left the dealership that day all we could do was smile.   My husband and I have already discussed that we never want to deal with any other dealership - EVER!

WE LOVE MARIA HALLER AND WE LOVE MERCEDES BENZ OF SUGARLAND!

Happy New Year!

235,"January 06, 2014","When my Mercedes showed that it had experienced a brake system failure, my regular service company recommended Mercedes Benz Sugarland for the warranty service. The service was scheduled for December 24, I expected that it would take several days due to the holidays. When I arrived Randy Els listened to my description of the problem and read the print out from my service tech. He correctly told me that he thought it was a software problem that could be easily fixed in a few hours. I was given a loaner and before noon Randy called to tell me that was car was ready and it had only been a software problem.  When I picked up my car it had been washed and a nail was found in the right rear tire that they pulled and plugged. From start to finish everyone that I encountered was professional, knowledgeable and friendly. When my 10 year old Mercedes needs to be replaced, Mercedes Benz Sugarland will be the first place I check.

Frank Kelske returned our call immediately and it didn't take long to realize that we had reached a top notch sales person.  We drove to Sugar Land and it took less time than we expected.  We couldn't be more pleased with the service we received from Frank.

Michelle went the extra mile to have me speak with a mechanic so that I could better understand the fault which was two faulty accumulators that had lost pressure.  As my car has low mileage and is garaged most of the time, I had to wonder if there was something I was doing or not doing that brought on this fault.  The Active Body Control system is a complex system that will go out over time, in my case eight years.  I could not comment on the price as I did not get multiple quotes.

Without a doubt the service I have received from Mercedes-Benz Sugarland, and specifically Paul Tamas and Tony Acciarri, has been far above that received from other dealerships, and truly exceptional.  Paul has been my service writer since 2007.  Paul always makes time for me and works with my schedule, always keeps notes about why my car is coming in for service, always ensures I have a loaner car when necessary, follows up promptly with diagnoses, repair options, and pricing, follows and relays my often 'special' instructions, and let's me know as soon as my car is ready and available for pick up.  Paul is always friendly and willing to help.  Tony Acciarri is the technician / mechanic who has worked on my car since 2007.  Tony takes the time to personally call me or email me with news and recommendations about my car.  Tony gives me servicing options that makes sense for my car, the performance I expect, and how I drive.  My car is always serviced or repaired correctly the first time, and when my car is returned it is clean, the settings are correct, and there are no negative signs of maintenance that sometimes occur elsewhere (fluids spilled, engine bay out of sorts, greasy fingerprints, repair materials left under hood or in the interior, codes not erased, scratches and dents, etc.).  I have a very high level of confidence and trust in both Paul and Tony and have recommended and will continue to recommend them to family and friends.

253,"November 14, 2013","Phil Nguyen did an outstanding job on all fronts in my adenture in buying a luxury SUV.   This being my first purchase in the luxury vehicle market, I had many questions - both when I was there for the test drive and also via e-mail.   Often times with my e-mail questions, Phil responded within minutes or shoirtly thereafter.  During test drives, he listened very paitiently and then followed up promptly via e-mail or phone call or text.  

My last vehicle purchase was in 1996 for a Ford Explorer SUV.  The biggest upgrade for me then was to go from crank windows to power windows.  With the Luxury SUV I was looking at; it was as if I was on the bridge of the starship Enterprise.  Light years ahead of what I was use too.  Phil let me test drive it as many times as I needed to try several of the variables for the vehicle.  If he did not know how a particular gadget worked, he readily sat with me to figure it out.   He also checked with the manufacturer for other questions I had.   And finally, they worked with me to stay in my budget and settle on an equitable price. 

At no time was there any pressure to buy or to hurry thorugh my review process.   He gave the feeling that he would be willing to spend as long as I needed to feel comfortable with my purchase.  Where time is the highest premium commodity, I am very appreciative of Phil's time.  I will highly recommend the dealership to my friends and when my wife replaces her car, we will look at the Mecerdes Benz dealership first!

256,"October 29, 2013","My husband and I needed to purchase a vehicle to replace our families Suburban, which was given to our 16 year old to drive.  We visited many dealerships in the Houston area and thought that we had our minds made up to purchase an Audi A7 from Momentum, until we came into Mercedes-Benz of Sugar Land.  We saw several cars on the showroom floor and met Joseph Kelske.  Joseph took us on a test drive, only after showing us all of the features on the car so that I was familiar with it during our test drive.  I want to point out that no other dealer did that during our search.  Joseph was very knowledgable and patient with us during our purchase experience. If he didn't know the answer to one of our questions, he got one quickly. I knew I wanted the E350 Cabriolet after driving  it, but the next obstacle was finding a car with the options and color that we wanted.  Over the course of the next week, we had spoken on the phone and exchanged emails multiple times. We came back in with our kids and he brought several cars around just to show us what a simple piece of trim would look like with a specific interior color.  He was very interested in our kids and was able to easily incorporate them into the car buying experience.  In the end, we bought the car from the showroom floor.  It was the closest to what we wanted, without having to wait for the exact car to be built and shipped.  I LOVE my new car by the way.  Joseph got us in to see Chelsea Gotcher.  We already had financing in place from our local bank, but Chelsea was able to beat that deal and lowered our APR by financing through the dealership.  Again, she was very knowledgeable.  We went over all of the options and packages available and she was able to answer all of our questions.  Hands down, it was the easiest and most pleasant financing experience that we've had.  After purchasing the car, Brent Menning was contacted me to schedule the Lo-Jack install and the Appearance package.  I found Brent to be very helpful as well.  My car was cleaned and I was able to use a Loaner car while it was being serviced.  

Overall, I have now purchased 8 vehicles in my lifetime.  We typically have purchased Chevrolet vehicles from my uncle at a local dealership.  This experience has been the best hands down.  My husband and I felt very welcome, but never pressured.  I look forward to purchasing many more Mercedes Benz vehicles from Joseph Kelske in the future.",5.0

All of these ""bells and whistles"" might have been intimidating to learn, if not for my Salesman, Frank.  Talk about ""going the extra mile!""  I think Frank spent over an hour with me, just orienting me to the car, showing me exactly how everything works and giving me ""hands-on"" training so that I could do it all myself.  I know everything is listed in the owner's manual, but it is MUCH less intimidating to have someone walk you through it all.  TALK about customer service!

He looked at my previous vehicle, appraised it, spoke with his manager and promised to make sure i drive out with a new/better vehicle/deal.

260,"October 22, 2013","When I finally decided to shed my ""Mommy vehicle"" several years ago for something more fun, on impulse we stopped at Mercedes-Benz of Sugar Land. We were fortunate enough to connect with Bojan Secerkadic as our salesman. I had no idea what kind of car I wanted, but knew the range of price that I wanted to stay within. Bojan was an excellent listener, filtering through all the items on my wish list to decipher what car would best meet my needs and still be within our budget. The car he recommended was the first car that I test drove on my ""find a great new car"" odyssey, and I knew the minute I drove it that this was the car for me!  He absolutely nailed it!!!  We were trading in my Mommy-Van, and throughout the entire process Bojan was knowledgeable and on top of every aspect of the transactions.  He was very clear in his explanations, making sure we understood every part of the process, and we felt like we were really educated and not just informed throughout the purchase and trade transactions. It was an absolute pleasure from start to finish.  Bojan was a consummate professional in every way.  He patiently went over all the bells and whistles my fun new car had, and made sure I was comfortable with it before I drove off the lot.  He invited me to return any time if I felt that I needed more tutorials on how to work any part of my wonderful new car. 

So  when we decided to buy my husband a fun new car last week, we of course returned to Bojan and Mercedes-Benz of Sugar Land!  My husband has been spoiled by driving his fully loaded Porsche Cayenne S, but he wanted a more tame daily driver to commute in.  I called Bojan ahead of our visit and he pre-selected three great cars based on my husband's wish list for us to see, and all three cars were great!  Having Bojan do the leg work for us, since we're always pressed for time was such a great option for us!  He has a thorough knowledge of his stock, and he refined our search based on what we wanted and was able to eliminate the necessity of us having to wander all through the lot in search of the right car.  It saved time and kept our energy levels and excitement high since we weren't wasting time on cars we didn't want.

My husband, our son and I all drove each car that Bojan had selected for us to test drive, and we all unanimously selected the M-B GLK.  It was the perfect fit for my husband's wants and needs.  The price was within the range we were prepared to pay, and as before, every aspect of the purchase went smoothly and pleasantly.  Cesar Moreira also stepped in to assist us during our purchase experience and he was another great employee to work with!  He was very courteous and helpful every step of the way.

We were unable to pick up the car for two days after we selected it, and while it was on the lot it sustained some minor damage which we didn't notice until after we got home.  We were very concerned, but Bojan and Cesar were gracious, understanding and proactive, and they were able to get the damage repaired quickly and the finished repairs more than exceeded our expectations.  

Chelsea Gotcher in Finance was delightful!  She has a warm and inviting personality that made us feel truly welcomed and special.  To have an employee in finance that makes customers wish the paying process would take a little longer so they can continue chatting with Chelsea is rare indeed!  

As great as Cesar and Chelsea are - we would never have interacted with them, nor purchased any cars from Mercedes-Benz of Sugar Land at all had it not been for the competence, courtesy, capabilities and breadth of knowledge of Bojan Secerkadic.  Twice now he has made purchasing a car feel like a stress-free experience where we were listened to, valued and respected, treated with the utmost courtesy and patience, and we drove off feeling like we had experienced something rare and wonderful - a salesman who truly knows how to sell. 

We cannot recommend him highly enough.

261,"October 18, 2013","My whole exprerience with MB Sugarland was fantastic from the first time I called initially and Bojan answered the phone I explained what I was looking for and what my expectations were and he told me to come in the next day and he would work hard to help me. I want to point out that I am aware that the day I got the car it was Bojan's day off and he told me I could talk to a colleague named Cesar but called me in the morning and told me he would go to work so I can achieve my goal of getting my new Mercedes. This is UNHEARD OFF in today's business world and my highest gratitude and commendation to Bojan for his excellent attention and gratitude for coming in. I would also like to commend David Cole since he worked really hard to make this deal done working as a team with Bojan and Harry St. Clair. I am aware of the difficulty of my situation and they did it. Regarding Harry's attention I was extremely pleased on his attitude, excellent communication, SUPER hard work he did with the banks to get me a lower rate and the maximum term possible so my payments would be within my budget. I personnally saw how Harry went out of his way calling banks and he GOT THE JOB DONE!!!

I drove 50 miles from my house in the Woodlands and will definetely do it again when I trade in my car in a few years or my wife's car

My highest praise to Mercedes Benz of Sugarland for the team worked demonstrated and outstanding client focused approach.

He found the vehicle I wanted and worked very hard to get all the ground work done before I drove to Sugar Land to make the purchase.  He had everything ready when we arrived and then we changed our mind and wanted a different vehicle.  Although, he had everything ready with the first car, he immediately went to work on getting us the different one we requested.  He continued to work very hard to make sure that we were pleased with our purchase.  He got the new car from a different lot and since it was brand new, it had to be made ready.  He got the service department on it right away so we could return home that night with our new car.  After we finished the paperwork, he took great care in showing us all the features on the car and explaining all the details.  He never rushed us and always had time to answer any questions we had.  He has even called us a couple of times to make sure everything was working properly and that we were satisfied.  
When we were directed to the finance department, a young woman named Chelsea Gotcher helped us and could not have been nicer.  She got us a better interest rate than I thought possible.
I guess in all the years we have been purchasing vehicles, this was probably the best buying experience that we have ever had.  I have never been treated any nicer any where.  I would highly recommend this dealership to anyone.  Be sure to ask for Frank and Chelsea....you will not be disappointed!!!!!",5.0
273,"September 24, 2013","This dealer, its service work is good. 

I had a horrable experience last week on a regular maintenance service. I requested for a regular maintenance and fix on a break wear warning. Service person only quote an expensive yearly maintenance($1200), it's not cover break wear, the whole conversation last for less than one minute. I was misleading to believe at this expenses it cover both. Don't know if the lady forget or intended. I was surprised to receive the 2nd estimate to fix break wear (another  $1300), so I ask to terminate further service.

From the review, this dealer rated high. So I respond their servey to customer manager. I am still waiting for response so far after 4 days.

Very professional and quick changing tire.  Drove down to dealership, but by this time, it had closed-gate up.  Started to drive around block and noticed a gate was open on the side, as I wanted to drop bad tire off. I commute downtown and was not looking forward to driving on a donut -all highway.  A person was just leaving the dealership ( Joseph Kelske ) , and asked if I needed help.  He had come back to work by chance, as had left something important he needed and was just driving out as I drove in.  What luck!  He offered to put the bad tire in his trunk and turn it in to service the next am.  He handed me his business card with his name on it. He waited until I was safely out of the lot  and assured me he would speak to Robert the next morning.  A friend picked me up early the next day to drive me to work, and then drove me back to Sugarland to get a new tire put on the car.  What more can you ask - 24 hours after the flat, my car was fixed.  Thank you Joseph Kelske for your help.  Things happen for a reason, glad you were there when I drove up!

He was friendly, open, and very customer service oriented. Other dealerships have a lot to learn from Mercedes-Benz of Sugarland in general, and in particular from Phillip Nguyen!

The only point of improvement I noticed at the dealership (which is of course not related to Phillip Nguyen in any way), is the attitude of the finance department. It would be great if they could be less pushy when offering additional coverage packages. A more fact oriented approach with less use of cunning sales tricks would be appreciated (but this may also be related to cultural differences, since I am a European that have previously mainly been dealing with the very objective and fact oriented German Mercedes-Benz dealerships).

I searched salesperson reviews and was impressed with the reviews that Frank had received, so I gave him a call expressing interest in the car. I told him the price the Greenway location had offered me for an outright purchase and also a lease, and when Frank offered me a great deal (which beat the Greenway price), I agreed to purchase the car. I wasn't able to pick the car up until late the next day, so Frank offered to stay past normal hours in order to help me get the car in a timely fashion. He spent 30-45 minutes walking my wife and I through all the car's features and answering our questions despite it being past the dealership's closing time. 

Paula in Finance was also very helpful and friendly. I had set up a bank loan in advance of my arrival, and Paula was ready with all of the necessary paperwork. Signing all of the paperwork was quick and easy thanks to Paula's preparation.

I'd estimated it would cost 2K for everything that needed to be done, and it was $18xx.xx.  I was close!  

One side note:  The car was detailed (and it looked beautiful!)  The only issue was that I could not lift the rear seat in order to maximize cargo space.  The gray, molded cover (behind the driver's side) shifted & covered the release latch.  I fussed with it, my dad fussed with it, and finally my husband was able to adjust it so that the seat bottom would lift / seat back would fold down.  

Perhaps in the future someone could test that to make sure the rear seats are functional (in both upright & folded positions) before the vehicle leaves the detail shop.

Thanks for all the professionalism & quality service!

335,"April 19, 2013","I HATE buying new cars, the experience is usually long and drawn out. The salesman goes to his manager and comes down on the price 5-8 times before we usually reach an agreement. David went to his sales manager once and came back with an offer that we thought was fair. Also, the sales manager never came over to haggle with us, it was just David, I like that. The salesman should have more power to do their job.  I honestly hate most car salesman as well, I can tell within 3 minutes of talking to them if I would even consider buying a car from them. David Di was really great to work with, I liked him as soon as we started talking. He is very friendly and has a great sense of humor. He also seems to really care about his customers, doesn't give the usual stupid sales pitch that I loath. I hope to only drive Mercedes from here on out and I hope that David Di will be my salesman. Please keep him on your staff, he is awesome. I will recommend him to all of my friends looking to buy a new car. Thanks Sugarland Mercedes for the great experience! 

The only negative thing I have to say is that I felt a bit uncomfortable when I walked in because so many people were standing around and watched every move I made when I walked in the door. The receptionist is fine, but 3 or 4 salesman standing there too was a bit weird. It's a little uncomfortable to have so many people watching you as you walk thru the doors and up to the front desk.

I've been to some dealerships around town where they don't give the customers such options and just go with the charges.

Although I had only planned on looking at the GLK I was so impressed with the service at the dealership and how professional our sales person Max Milikov was, I ended up purchasing two Mercedes that day. I purchased the Mercedes GLK for me and the Mercedes C300 for my teenage daughter. I also got the highest value on my trade-in and an extra discount on both Mercedes. When I went to pick up the second Mercedes the next day, Max surprise us by taking us to the Mercedes Benz store, where he   allowed us to choose two gifts (We chose two gorgeous mugs) and he bought them for us, truly impeccable service. I will always be a repeat customer.  I highly recommend this dealership. We love both vehicles and we could not be happier.

He is perfectly suited to heading up the Smart branch, not only for his excellent grasp of the different Smart buyer profiles (half of the market share is for Mercedes or big SUV owners who want a second 'practical' car, and the other half is  passionate about Smart's quirkiness and originality, we're in it for the lifestyle statement), but for his visible appreciation for the car and everything it stands for.  My experience was an exceptional one, because I was somewhat forced to buy a new Smart prematurely when my 2009 Brabus died due to a fluke engine problem.  Chris helped turn a traumatic stroke of bad fortune into the most pleasurable auto purchase I've ever made.

I inquired about his SLK inventory and he eagerly informed he had several in stock.  I came by and generally liked the SLK as a car, but didn't really see one that interested me.  After determining what I was looking for, he called all over the state (and maybe into neighboring states) to see if he could find 'my' car.  He did indeed locate a beautiful SLK 350 in Austin so my wife and I went up there to see it - it was indeed a very nice SLK 350 and my wife and I both loved it, but by that time my mind was set on getting the SLK 55 AMG.  Dave then checked around for one of those, but there were really none to be had, so on 13 April 2012, Dave and Howard 'spec'd' out my AMG!  They both double-checked to make sure it was 'just what I wanted'.  Dave informed that AMG had their own production schedules and that I'd have to be patient - in fact, my order form stated that I should expect to take delivery betweent July - late August.  During all this time, Dave kept me well informed of all developments as he received information.  I even made a couple of minor changes to my order and he made sure they were implemented.  He even took the time to 'scan' the NetStar docs and e-mail them to me so that my info was just as current as his.  He never once complained about my checking back with him - which were pretty frequent.  In fact, I think he was just as excited as I was about the car.  He never gave 'false hope' of when the car might arrive and so I was never disappointed about when it might be ready.  Considering that I'd always bought a car right off the lot, I'd say all in all, Dave and Howard made my custom order a reasonably pleasant experience - I really don't think much could be done to shorten the wait because I ordered it the first week that the 2013's were available for order.  I'll have no trouble recommending MB Sugarland as a dealership where someone should expect fair, prompt and professional service at all levels when looking for a new car.",4.8

Prior to coming to Mercedes Benz of Sugarland and working with Frank, I was dissattisfied with the service I received from another dealer located in Houston. It was originally my intentions to leave the Mercedes family and go to another luxury line; however because Frank handled me like a person and not a sale, I was more convinced than ever that Mercedes is where I need to stay; specifically Mercedes of Sugarland with Mr. Kelske. Due to his caring, understanding and committment to excellence, Frank has ensured that he will have a lifelong customer.

While I was waiting for him to finish with the paper work he offered me a cup of coffee which I enjoyed. Then after he was done, he walked me to the Loaner car department. They already had my loaner car set up with my name on it which really saved some valuable time that I didn’t have. It sounds like I took a long time over there, but I was out of there in less than half an hour. I had been to other Mercedes Benz dealerships with appointments and had to wait for over half an hour before even talking to my assigned Service Advisor.

Even though they still had a good 5mm (approx 1/4')of pad remaining (which at the time I was not told).  Hence I agreed to have them replaced. Upon inspection of the old pads the brake wear sensor was about 1-2mm away from being contacted and with 5mm of pad remaining, it did not appear critical that the brake pads be replaced.  Further after MB service repaired the fuel smell issue, they returned the car with a very strong smell of gas inside the cabin that was reported at the time of pickup but ignored by the service adviser.  Stating that it will go away in a few days ... which it did not!   The car had to be returned a second time to have the interior thoroughly cleaned.  

I received an email exchange with MB Sugar Land VP Service who never appologies for returning the car with the gas smell and further fails to recognize that while technically correct in his call to replace the brake pads, there was still a great deal of pad remaining!

Poor customer service at MB Sugar Land!  With a VP Service like Daryl Eckert that would rather brow beat the customer then recognize the issue and never apologizes for returning the car with an interior that had a strong smell of gas.

I received a call that the back windshield had &amp;quot;blown out&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;how did I want to handle the $2,600 replacement&amp;quot;.  IMAGINE my surprise.  (I found out subsequent that, though rare, windows can crack from heat but it is due to faulty glass being installed initially.)  I gave up fighting and paid the bill.  When I picked up the car there was glass still all over the floorboards, a large grease stain on the leather, one of the seat belts was cut and a quarter size chunk of paint had been gouged from the driver's side door.  Begrudgingly they repaired the damage that THEY had done, but would only touch up the door and refused to properly repaint it.  In total they had my car one day short of a month.  The car is an SL500 and when the temperatures finally got cool enough I lowered the top.  Much to much surprise a four foot section of the rear deck trim came off and thudded in the trunk.

Which is bull crap because all they did was clean the sunroof, etc. and charge us over $700 in labor!  And even after the fact when we picked up our car the service light came back on stating that there was too much oil in the car.  To think you was being charged $700 for labor they would have checked the oil level!  We should bill them for our time coming back to the dealership for them to fix the problem!!

457,"September 25, 2009","I have been to this dealership many times and the Service Advisor that I deal with every time is Robert Fruge. This guy is like the trustworthy saint of all dealerships. Not kidding. I refuse to take my car anywhere else only because this guy is so direct about the services, costs and possibilities when there is a problem. The most notable few instances: 

Car tire tread was diminishing and it was time to get new tires (so I thought) and since they were running a special on tires for my make & model I asked for them.  Robert inspected all the tires and said that there was no reason to spend right now if I didn't want to on two of the tires because there was still quite a bit of tread life left? HUH?? A service guy who will save me money?! You've got to be kidding! So I only needed two tires and saved a bundle.

I tore up part of the front bumper on a parking stump. He asked me several questions about how long I was keeping the car, cost of a temporary fix vs a permanant replacement, pros & cons, etc. It was unbelievable all the options I had and how thorough my explanations were. Now he doesn't always lay everything out on the table..you ask questions..and for every question you ask he has a wealth of information. He is also a super, super nice guy. 

I had a huge car problem on a warranty covered MB and  the problem occurred close to that other dealership (MB) on the 59, so I took it there.  What a nightmare. They misdiagnosed the problem, Wanted a small fortune for it & had no loaner cars, sent me out the door without a loaner and so I called Robert at the Sugarland dealership and he got me an appt the next morning, into a loaner car and come to find out, that the problem was completely different than the other dealerships diagnosis and it was also all covered under warranty. Robert explained to me in full detail what happened to the car.

Have any of you tried to compare the service A & B costs between the Mercedes Benz of Sugarland dealership & the MB of Houston Greenway? Well I have! And this is why I originally decided to drive from Uptown/Galleria all the way to Sugarland to service my MB. It is because MB Sugarland has a minimal fee and will charge for any additional parts that need replacement. The other dealership charges you for everything to be replaced whether it needs to be or not.  

I commend this place!  I recommend that if there are any women out there who has trust issues with dealerships ..go talk to Robert Fruge and you will be happy you did. 

Sincerely,

458,"May 20, 2009","I Have purchased several cars from MB Sugar Land, and had the SERVICE ""A"" performed on it, and it was like having heart surgery done by a 7 year old, it was all down hill from there...As soon as i get the car back ""AFTER PAYING A RIDICULES AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR IT"" the check tire pressure light went on, so i took it back and waited on a work day 1:30 Hrs so they can plug the tires, so then the nexxt day the light cam back on UH HUH you know where I'm going, DIRECTLY TO THE DEALER FROM THE GROCERY STORE, so they kept me there for 45 mins till they tell me i need to replace the tire and it would cost $500+labor and balancing, so i told him to bring my car back up and i would consider it, so 25 mins later my car never showed, and the guy who brings the cars up to service seen me waiting for such a long time said to me ""Lets go see what's up with your car"" so we went in the service shop and there were 3 guys working to get my car back down from the rack, and they actually told me to take my car to Discount Tire Co. BC they can repair the tire better then them LOL, i was laughing and said are you serious? and he showed me how they repair the tires and i was so disappointed and disturbed in how un-safe there tire repair is, he drilled a hugh hole in my tire :NEVER REMOVED IT FROM THE CAR and shoved a gum like substance in the tire and told me to go on my way. So when i got to discount tire they told me that MB Sugar Land screwed the tire up more then what it was so i can buy new tires from MB Sugar Land, so when i called to explain this to them, there was this one person who failed to listen to me, but insulted my intelligence, called me a lier and further more tried to make it look like he was rectifying the situation by offering me his tire at cost ""PLEASE!""
so long story short i ended up buying a new tire from discount with a warranty for a tire that MB sugar land ""sabotaged"" in order to make more money...

just for the record, my car was purchased this year, is an 09 brand new with 7500 miles that i have driven, and since i purchased this car there has been several problems with it from the get go. my car was sold to me for $105,000.00.

This dealer will not be around for long, there rip offs. ",1.0
459,"October 04, 2008","I would like to warn other readers wanting to purchase an automobile from Mercedes Benz of Sugarland to reconsider. I would reccommend any other dealership in Houston but this one. For the last 32 years, my family and I have only owned Mercedes. My husband and I decided to purchase a car from MB of Sugarland bc it was a smaller dealership and we were hoping to develop a long term relationship. However, my experience with them has probably been one of the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EXPERIENCES I've ever had. They are only looking for quick sales bc once you have purchased your new vehicle, forget about customer service. In the world of Mercedes Benz of Sugarland, the customer is never right, the dealership is. The experience was so bad that after all these years of being a benz owner, I decided to sell my car and buy a Range Rover.",1.0
460,"May 09, 2008","I was lied to, yelled at, threatened, and humiliated. To top it all off, my visit to Mercedes-Benz of Sugarland ended with a visit from the police for being on their property...AFTER I LEFT! I'm supposed to explain the rating I gave, and zero is not an option, so let me go down the list of one's. For Customer Service I was told they would be open until 7:00. At 6:55, when I got there, I was completely ignored until 7:05(when their computers shut down and I cannot pick-up a pre-paid part). I was told to make the 30 mile trip again the next morning. That is very poor Customer Service. For the Quality of Work, they tried to push me out the door so they could go home. The parts and service manager even told me he didn't have a key to the parts dept. Does that even make sense? Shouldn't the manager of the department have a key? For Friendliness, I had the ""Customer Care Manager"" two inches from my face yelling at me when I made a comment of poor customer service. I thought he was going to hit me. Is that friendly? The Overall Experience left me across the street, off of their property waiting for the key they promised they would bring to me. Instead of bringing me the key across the street (off of their property) they brought me the police. I would call that a very bad Overall Experience. Even though I left when told to, and was off the property they filed a criminal arrest warrant. I'm a criminal? I thought I was an Eagle Scout. Besides, since when is a customer a criminal after he paid? By the way, they tricked me by telling me to wait. I thought I was getting a key, little did I know I was waiting on the police. They hired a courier to bring me the key the next day. As far as the price, it was more expensive then the price I was quoted by another Mercedes dealership. I should have driven the extra 15 miles. EVERYBODY LISTEN! STAY AWAY FROM MERCEDES-BENZ OF SUGARLAND! THEY ARE THE CRIMINALS.  ",1.0
461,"August 28, 2007",Worst service i have ever seen...i bought a brand new ML and 240...Spend more time for service than drive the vehicle. Customer service F-.  They wrencked my suv and to top it off my fog light i bring in for service was never fix. After i confronted the manager he gave me a detail service for free...but the detail was half ass done to (rug was never shampoo). Now my 240 is showing problem (head light out) call them for service thought it's going to be a quick fix..but the female in service dept. was a bitch from hell..not sure if she was having PMS or what..I WILL NEVER BUY A MERCEDES AGAIN...,1.0
462,"April 17, 2007","Totally unprofessional staff, very rude. If they see you driving an expensive model, expect to be stuck with them for at least 2-3 weeks.

Everytime you would be driving out from the dealership you would have to come back very soon, as something else in your car would fail. The only explanation you get from their technical advisors would be something like ""I'm not sure"" or ""We thought the problem was this, but it turnes out to be that"", etc., nothing specific.

The worst thing is (apart from ripping you off) that you loose a lot of your time and never feel confident about their work.",1.0
463,"August 03, 2006",I purchased a vehicle from them on 7/28 and today 8/3 the car is having mechanical problems.  I called and they are doing nothing to help me to fix the problem.  I do realize that the vehicle was a used vehicle but I did purchase the car only 6 days ago.  And for them to do nothing to help me is very unprofessional.  I do not reccommend anyone go to this dealership for a new or used vehicle.,1.0
