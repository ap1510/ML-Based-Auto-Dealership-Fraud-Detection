1,"October 19, 2019","Last night after work, my wife's car literally shout down while she was pulling into the driveway.  Tim Langston was very helpful and reassuring and assisted us in getting her vehicle transported to the dealership for warranty work (the transmission valve body was at fault).  Tim contacted us this morning before the time he had promised with a status update and recommendations to consider for better performance of her vehicle.  Then Larry, the service manager, got on the telephone to assure both my wife and me that they would deliver her car to her after completion of the work.  Her car was towed over 50 miles to the dealership, I am returning from out of town, and he personally delivered my wife's car to our residence to ensure that she has her car for her employment.  Definitely recommend this service team for any repairs!!  Great job and customer service from both Tim and LArry!!",5.0

Once my appointment was set, I was taken care of by Vanessa Weathers who was very professional in every way while making me feel at home at the same time.

19,"May 20, 2019","Our salesman was very kind and helped us with whatever we needed. He had very good costumer service. They really wanted to sell the car to us and did whatever (to a certain point of course) they needed to give us a good deal. Now while everyone else was good to us the finance guy, Tommy, had HORRIBLE customer service. We talked down the price as much as we could to him. From the very start he was irritated and had an attitude the whole time all because we knew what they were doing. We know about selling cars so no one could over charge for the cars worth. He made us feel dumb and when we went in a 2nd time he told us he didnt have time for us to be ""wasting his time"" like last time. Which we didnt we just tried to talk down the price. His attitude was horrendous and he looked irritated that he was there doing his job. He made sure we knew he didnt like our business and we almost walked out indefinitely bc of him. Tommy the finance guy made the experience so bad since we spent most of our time with him talking about numbers.",3.8

23,"April 23, 2019","Don Herring Mitsubishi is full of great people, great service, great cars and outstanding experiences. From the time you walk in, you know you are in a low pressure environment with people who want to help accomplish the same goal- getting you into the right car for your family. 

Last year, we purchased a used Mini- Cooper with Don Herring Mitsubishi in Irving through Gary. The experience was fantastic. We purchased an extended warranty on the car and 2 months after, the water pump went out. Because of the build of the MIni Cooper, the part is not covered by the warranty. Larry, the service manager, took care of the repair- estimated at nearly $800 at our local mechanic shop, for free. There was zero charge. What a great team! Mr. Herring approved the repair at Larry's request and they took care of us, just because they have high standards and impeccable character. 

This year, it was time to get a new family vehicle and we chose Don Herring Mitsubishi Irving again. Gary once again offered his phenomenal service and we purchased a beautiful 2019 Mitsubishi Outlander. 

During our experience, Tiffany at the service counter took time and great care to help keep our three young children occupied by offering word finds and things to color. She allowed them to earn treats by turning in completed work. What a gift and blessing!

Tommy Hunter in the Finance department took great care going through everything and even went back through our deal to make sure we had necessary GAP insurance and kept the same payment. He was able to lower our interest rate and offered more on my trade in to cover the added insurance. Great guy!

I can say we will refer anyone we know to Don Herring Mitsubishi! 

Thank you to everyone at Don Herring! ",5.0

63,"June 12, 2018","This was my first experience with Don Herring Mitsubishi Irving. I learned of them through searching the net for a particular vehicle I was looking for, and they happened to have a potential ""Keeper"" for me. I was very apprehensive at first, not knowing anyone at the dealer, or the area. I live about 45 minutes away. I phoned the dealership to confirm that the vehicle I was interested in was still there, and I spoke with Steven Curry, who i didn't believe was his real name. I said I'd like to come on in and check it out, and he said, ""Great. It'll be up front and ready for you when you get here."" I can't say enough about Steven as my sales contact. He was outstanding. No slick sales gimmicks, no pressure, no attempts at manipulative ploys. Just great, accommodating service. It sounds like a cliche, but we hit it off like this guys been my buddy for years. And trust me, I'm a skeptical type of personality. I ended up purchasing the vehicle I was interested in, for a price that I was comfortable with. No hassles. Just civil, relaxed negotiations. Steven went above and beyond when I had questions about anything he was ready with a response or solution. Unbelievable! Gave me complete peace of mind, which we all know, is close to priceless.",5.0

67,"May 19, 2018","I did a trade in for a truck they had on the lot. There was some issues with it and they went out of the way to get it fixed before i ourchased it. I soon had a couple hickups with the truck for some time after and i out about $600 into fixing it and contacted the dealership to see if we could work something out for help with the other stuff needing fixed. As of right now they have the vehicle still getting the issues fixed. They didnt have to do this they could have easily said sorry and sent me on my away. For that alone and everything they have done without needing to i will recomend this dealership and vouch first hand they will take care of you regardless!!

****update**** they have the truck and have replaced the issues that were needing fixed. Ill stand by them whenever they say they will do whatever they can to make you happy. Best car dealership ive been to!!

74,"March 24, 2018","I bought my very first brand new car, and it's the last thing I expected to be able to do.

Going into a financing situation with challenged credit can be a nightmare, but my situation left me in a position in which I had to try anyway. I walked in, fully expecting to be humiliated and turned away. It was NOTHING like that.

From the warm, sincere greeting on our entry, the genuine interest by our sales hero, Steve Curry, the jovial and encouraging finance manager, Tommy Hunter, who worked INCREDIBLY hard to help me, and even an interaction with Don Herring himself, I felt like a valued, respected, and appreciated FRIEND, not a customer. I have never in my life thought I would use the words ""sincere"" or ""integrity"" in reference to a car dealership experience, but this team is amazing. 

Make no mistake about it: NO other dealership could have gotten me into a car, much less a BRAND NEW 2018 vehicle with less than 50 miles on the odometer. I didn't have to beg, plead, or even really negotiate for a reasonable monthly payment. These folks all GENUINELY care about helping out the people who offer them the chance to do so. Professional, courteous, witty, warm, and generous, working with Steve, Tommy, and their team is an experience I will happily do again in the future and recommend to ALL my family and friends.

83,"December 22, 2017","Let me start by saying I'm 50 years old and I hate buying a car through a dealership and generally avoid them at all cost.  My daughter found a used Outlander Sport online, in the particular color she wanted and asked us to go with her to look at it.  We did our research online as to price and options and called to check availability before making the drive. We were met by Steven and Tommy upon arrival who immediately made us feel at home and at ease. The car was ready and waiting for her to test drive. There was no pressure or back and forth to the mgr. dealer games.  After a brief negotiation on the price and a little paperwork, she was driving it home. Steven took the time to help my her hook up the blue tooth and show her all the gadgets and how they worked. This was by far the easiest and most stress free car buying experience I have ever had.  Don Herring Jr even stopped by and thanked us for our business.  If your looking for a stress free, quick and easy car buying experience give these guys a try.  We're glad we did!",5.0

With a new baby only way, they took the time to go over several options and several size cars. From a outlander sport, to an Escape,then a CRV and last was the full size Outlander. They allowed me to get mybcar seat out and try it in each vehicle. Thia is what lead me to purchasing the new Outlander and not the smaller sport. From pwr sale to post sale Walter was very professional and spent over an hour with me both times. He showed me all the features of the vehicle to ensure I had knowlegde of where they were located in thw vehicle and how each one worked.

139,"April 11, 2016","I upgraded my outlander with a newer release outlander last Nov 2014. JR was the one who convinced me to get it. He was great, he showed me how the newer outlander worked and we even did a road test before bringing the car to home just to show me how an ACC worked. I only had one issue during that time. I have just purchased a roof rack kit for my previous outlander, so i told JR that i need to take it back and put it on the new outlander. However, there was no key that was provided to me when i purchased that roof rack, so there is no way they can do it at that time. He then promised me that they will try to contact other dealer/office that they might be able to get a key. To cut the chase, JR transferred to another dealership. So i have been talking to Jason Bell (JRs manager or senior?) since then. For more than a year (it's already April 2016), this issue has not been resolved. They promised me they would get back but which never happened. I am only able to speak with them about it if i go to the office. He made me speak with the service manager, Mike Wright. Still nothing happened, i always  got the same promise. Until today, Jason confirmed that he couldn't do something about it.

142,"April 08, 2016","This dealership has an expert management staff and excellent customer service to rectify any and all issues. It's probably why they've gained such a great reputation, which is well deserved. That being said I cannot in good conscience give their service center a positive review.  I brought my car in for a routine transmission flush and to run a diagnostic because the check engine light had gone on. The problem was an O2 sensor, a fairly small repair. They had to order the part, and told me to come back the following Monday for the repair. But they charged me for the diagnostic which is not a common occurrence when you're getting repairs done in the same shop. In my experience I've never actually been charged for this. Two days later before I had gone back for my O2 sensor installation, my car wouldn't start. No issues with my car, the alternator, the starter, and the battery was new. Couldn't figure out what was wrong so I called AAA. AAA arrived and fixed the issue within 30 seconds. It seems that the Mitsubishi dealership service center had taken the battery apart and failed to tighten it back on. Literally just an issue of an untightened screw that caused me a morning of headache, not being able to get my car to start. This is a careless mistake, but one loose screw can cause greater problems than just a car not starting. It can be an issue of life or death if a few screws are loose in your car.

Initially I had felt that both myself as a customer and my car, had been dealt with rather carelessly and recklessly. Until management stepped in to fix the problems. I applaud them for this but still wish the issues could have been avoided from the start. I don't think I should have been charged for the diagnostic, which in the end would have been burning $120 for no reason, IF they had not done the repair for me at no cost. I also can't find any justification for not tightening the screw on my battery. Causing me a full morning of headache with AAA. I certainly won't be back to this service center, but I hope that management will be able to take a very good look at the goings-on here and make sure that the mechanics are doing their due diligence and that the service attendants are charging fairly. I do have full faith that Don Herring being of the highest caliber in dealerships, will fix these issues promptly.",3.0

I was selling my paid-off 2008 Galant Ralliart that I still LOVE to a family member who needed a car fast, it stays in the family and I still get to see it.  ;-)   I was therefore sans vehicle.  I usually do all my homework on a vehicle BEFORE walking in to a dealer, but this time I was not able to as it was Christmas Eve (busy).    Carlos was very nice, and worked to find the car that I wanted with all the options I needed.  

When it came to playing the payment game, I am not a fan, I worked with Tim and he got me the payment I could afford.   In the past I get financing first, and go to a dealer as a cash buyer and know the price of the vehicle I am getting, and negotiate the price of the vehicle vs. payment, so this was like flying blind for me.  

Jason Bell came by and shook my hand and congratulated me on my purchase.  

Overall a great experience as later I found an ad for the exact vehicle I purchased, and for a while thought I had not received all the discounts it noted, but once I calmed down and crunched the numbers, it was exactly what they said, just noted differently on the contract.

182,"April 21, 2015","We browsed the internet to determine our price range and parameters of options that we wanted for our next vehicle. Our previous vehicle was a 2005 Mitsubishi Outlander, and loved it so much that we did more research on the size, options, and price of the 2014 or 2015 Outlander. 

Then we looked at the dealership's web pages, and Don Herring Mitsubishi was the only one that had a large selection of vehicles and options for the model that we wanted. The other dealerships in the area couldn't even scratch the surface with in-stock vehicles when we were window shopping. Again, donherring.com won, therefore we made plans to visit the Irving location.

When it was time to test drive and get a feel for the new model Outlander, the process went smooth. The salesman made it easy to covey our wants, and then to compare it to what was available on the lot. Our heels were dug in on a price that we were NOT willing to go over. They LISTENED! Our only aftermarket add-on was a trailer hitch; it was available for install in less than a week, and that,too, was a smooth exchange.

So, to summarize; we are very happy customers with our second purchase at Don Herring Mitsubishi, and proud owners of ANOTHER Outlander.

-a vehicle brand you like,
-a dealership that possesses quality vehicles,
-a great sales and office staff

194,"October 26, 2014","Dealer reviews always seem to be over the top - either good or bad.  I'm going to try to go into WHY I had such a great experience at Don Herring Mitsubishi in Irving.

I started by emailing them expressing interest in a few Lancer Evolutions they had, and stated I preferred to be contacted via email.  And they actually listed.  I had great communication from Jessica their Internet sales director.  We decided that I would come in on a weekday during my lunch break to look over and drive the car, but would not have much time.  She promised me the car would be ready when I got to the dealership.

And the car was ready.  I was in and out in 30 minutes.  Amazing, so many dealerships play games to keep you there.  None of that at Don Herring.  Jose took me for the test drive, and mentioned when we were done that he knew I had to leave soon.  I asked him to have someone look over my trade in, and asked about a different Evo that was at Don Herring Plano.

Jose had my car looked over just a few minutes later, and promised to get me the car from Plano to look at later that night or the weekend.  Again, this is ALL done in 30 minutes including a long test drive.

True to his word, Jose had the car from Plano a few hours later.  I went back that night, drove the second Evo, and decided to start the negotiation process.  Their first offer to me...was more than fair.  Both the price on the car, and the value for my trade.  I was a little taken aback - dealerships aren't supposed to work like this right?  I asked for a few extras to be thrown in and a slight adjustment on the price, and we struck a deal.

I came in the dealership with my own financing at 1.9%.  They said they could match it, but were happy to let me use my own financing as well.  Jonathan even stated they had worked with my credit union in the past, and they were a great organization.  Very low pressure.  I let them have my financing since they had done such an outstanding job.

Jason Bell was filling in for the finance manager since this was late at night, and he did a great job on that part.  Jason is a true Evo enthusiast, but also very knowledgeable and reasonable about performance cars in general.  It felt like I was chatting with a fellow car guy the entire time.  

Really great group of people here at Don Herring, they acted like real people, no fake veneer put on to sell cars.  And because of that, they got my business that day.  I was in no rush to buy, this was a purchase for pleasure for me.  I would go back to Don Herring anytime - this is how all dealerships should be!

202,"July 14, 2014","I spent the day bouncing from dealer to dealer, jostling the salesmen with my fickle urgency to leave, seeing who would bring the right stuff to my attention. As it happens, I was testing out a used Toyota here, that I thought I liked, but I had to ask what Mitsubishi had similarly while I was in the lot. Great Scott! This model felt me! I couldn't seem too desperate, so I kindly refrained from filling out their survey of hopes and dreams to pursue the same venture elsewhere. Later that day, I went to the Don Herring in Plano. I wanted a test drive. I was designated shotgun... Okay I guess, but the point was to feel if I was good in it, not if the guy in the tie knew how to drive and talk at the same time. Looking at reviews, I knew noise and poor acceleration were the downsides of this vehicle. When this guy asserted his encompassing view, He pointed to lack of cupholders. When I low-balled my budget so as to actually stay within budget, he gave me figures at a negotiation 1k above sticker plus add-ons I told him I don't want. I called the guys in Irving, which basically saved me 3k on my metal squeeze. In fact, after the purchase I had every employee's attention, as if I was a god before them. A round of handshakes on me, and everyone, whether feigning or sincere, congratulated me on the dip in my savings.

Since the dealer of lowest quote from Truecar  quote is in Houston area, I called Mitsubishi dealerships in Dallas area to find out whether anyone would be able to match the price. Among 7 dealers that I contacted by phone, only Donherring Irving was the most transparent and straightforward in telling that, they will match the price. Next day, when I visited their show room, I received friendly and honest service from Mr. Drew Kennedy and Mr. Mike Rice. In my past experience, working with Finance managers in car dealership is not at all pleasant, Mr. Tim Carpenter is an exception to this norm; he told me right away that he would not be able to match the rates that I have. Moreover, no gimmicks to up sell things that I am not interested in such as Zurich shield, anti theft device etc. etc...

All of these guys were honest, up front, professional and the nicest people to work with. This was the easiest, fastest and most enjoyable car buying experience I have had. I will recommend to my family and friends Don Herring Mitsubishi Irving for any future car purchase.

After our third visit to the dealership we finally decided on color, transmission, and the ES model with no add-ons. Once again they hunted the car down and had it on the lot the next day. I was very pleased with my experience at this dealership. ",5.0

230,"December 02, 2013","We were shopping for a Lancer Evolution in many MANY dealerships throughout the metroplex; Weatherford to Arlington to Plano and anywhere in between, and finally settled on Don Herring Mitsubishi in Irving.  The weather that weekend had been bitterly cold, windy and occasionally rainy, but Issac was the only salesman at any of the dealerships who braved the elements to greet us while we roamed the lot.  After getting to know us a bit better over some hot chocolate, he pulled around a white GSR model; exactly what I had been looking for.  After a test drive, I was hooked, but the price was a little more than I was hoping to pay.  I indicated that I had found a similar model for less at another dealership and Jason helped explain some of the gimmicks used by less reputable internet ads to lure customers through the door... but still negotiated a lower price and fantastic interest rate that was fair for both of us. He also was very knowledgeable on all things Evo-related and informed us about local track days that the dealership helps sponsor.  This is definitely the place to go if you're looking to buy an Evo.  There are enthusiasts working here, not just salesman.  I took delivery on the car later that week (by my own choice), and Tim had us in and out of his office in about 20 minutes after explaining all the financial paperwork we were signing and giving us our warranty information.  Finally, after gassing up the car, Issac helped walk us through all the regular usage buttons (steering wheel controls, etc) and some uncommon locations for things we might have otherwise overlooked (battery and washer fluid in the trunk, etc) as well as sync up my smartphone to the car's Bluetooth.  Gave us a handshake and we were on our way. :)  All in all a low pressure and friendly experience.",5.0
231,"December 02, 2013","Before I entered the dealership, I felt welcomed.  Greg Eaglin opened the door for me and I was impressed.  I was quickly directed to Johnathan who directed me to Greg.   I was even more impressed with Greg as he patiently and enthusiastically waited through the period of processing the deal.  Then, I went to Tim for the final part of the process.  He was great, too.  In conclusion, it was indeed a great experience and would not hesitate to recommend Don Herring dealership to my friends and associates.  Thanks for a great experience and deal.

I explained to him I had been looking around and honestly had received a couple of better deals.
He asked for the amount and to give him a few hours.
I received a call back within the hour, he told me they would beat the deal and if I wanted the car, it would be ready in an hour.

235,"November 19, 2013","I have purchased 2 cars from this location.  They have done all my service, until now.
On Oct 14, took my Mitsubishi in for an oil change.  After an hour and 45 min, the service manager( this is a new person) came in and said my car needed a new air filter and cabin filter.  I told him I normally do the air filter myself.  He said the cabin filter had to be changed by a Licensed Mechanic?
When my car was returned, it had not been vacuumed and was streaked and still dirty.  Apparently, the battery had been disconnected and all my radio stations deleted.  Dont know why.  Also, someone had rummaged through the console and glove box.
When I went to purchase an air filter and cabin filter, I was told my car does not have a cabin filter.
Approx 2 weeks later, I noticed both low beam headlights were out.
I took the car back to the service dept. I did not have an appt.  They were very busy and I was told to leave my car and they MIGHT be able to get it checked out by the end of the day. This was a Fri.  I did not have a ride and told them I would bring it back.  The man, who did not introduce himself came out as I was driving off and said wait and he would have someone look at it right fast.  He took my car into the garage. About 15 min later, he returned with my car.  He said the light switch was bad, they could not get power to it.  I told him I would call next week and make an appt to bring my car back.
On my way home, I stopped at Hurst Autoplex, Mitsubishi.  The service manager greeted me and I told him my problem. He immediately took my car into the service area.  He came back in less than 5 min saying BOTH headlight bulbs were burned out and brought them in to show me. He said it was odd that both bulbs were blown at the same time.  There must have been some sort of electrical issue.  They did check and did not find anything.  
Less than an hour later, the bulbs were replaced and I was on my way.
Looking back, I have to wonder why it took so long to change the oil and why my battery had been un-connected at Don Herring. Did the mechanic do something?
Something has changed at Don Herring, all new faces.  I miss Ebby, the service manager.  He was an asset to your company, always very polite and helpful.  ",1.5

Although I spent about 6 hours at the dealership test-driving cars and waiting for the finance paperwork, Greg remained focused and attentive.

The credit/finance office guys are awesome, too! Have you ever before heard of a car dealership actually finding a way to lower the agreed-upon monthly payment by $25 a month? These gentleman did just that. Tim called me back two or three days after I made the purchase with this good news.

I have an awesome warranty package as well as roadside assistance included in my monthly payment. The Mitsubishi Outlander Sport that I purchased is amazing ... I keep discovering new, cool features every day. This vehicle gets excellent safety, mileage and style reviews from the major auto consumer report sites. All of my friends love the looks of my OS ... a friend's pre-teen son even said ""Wow! That's the car I want when I'm old enough to drive!"" If a vehicle's appearance passes a 10-year-old boy's ""test"", it must be a winner.

I ALMOST did not buy a car from them as one of the Managers offer me 1000 for my trade.

The sales rep, Ken Jenkins and his mgr Brett Cantrell made me feel like we were on the same team, as if we were working towards the same goal.  It was so much better than what unfortunately happens at other dealerships.

My wife & I are expecting our first child in a few months so we were looking for a crossover SUV type and found a great new car with the Mitsubishi Outlander Sport. If you're looking for a great value, I highly recommend you talk to Ken at Don Herring.  He can answer practically any question you have on any of their vehicles.

256,"May 03, 2011","My wife and I bought an Outlander in 2010 and a Lancer in 2011 from Don Herring Mitsubishi in Irving, TX. On both occasions the sales experience was pleasant.  The sales reps were never pushy; they went out of their way to find me a vehicle that would meet our needs.  They were eager for my business but attentive to what we wanted and didn't want in a car. The pricing was very competitive both times; the price on my new Lancer ES was below that which other Mitsubishi dealers advertised on the internet and was also less than similar automobile makes being sold in the area. The staff were very friendly and gave my kids balloons to help entertain them while my wife and I were considering our new purchase. The staff follows up post-sale to make sure you are happy with your purchase.  I also recommend that you get your vehicle serviced here, as the oil changes are very reasonable and the service team washes your vehicle meticulously with every visit so that your car is returned spotless. They usually vacuum the car too, which with my kids' trail of snack crumbs is much appreciated. There are also a lot of money-saving oil change coupons they send you via email, not to mention the buy-four-get-one-free oil change punch card.  Mr. Ebby Pourkaed, the service manager, showed that Mitsubishi proudly stands by their warranty; I had no problems with my Outlander except for a frayed seat cover and a stubborn dome light, but both were repaired at no cost to me.  I had inadvertently missed my 12K service on my Outlander but Mr. Pourkaed gave me a free tire rotation at my 15K service (the tire rotation is normally part of the 12K but not the 15K).  The exemplary sales and service experience at Don Herring over the past year with our Outlander brought us back last week to buy a second car from Don Herring, our new Lancer.

258,"July 24, 2010","I bought a 2009 Lancer at the end of 2008 and got treated really well, I made at least two requests for special discounts on top of an already good price and they considered them and actually did it.  But the reason I am leaving feedback is service after sales. I deployed to Iraq for all of 2009 and my wife drove the new car visiting relatives over several states, I put 3,000 on it myself when I was home on mid-tour leave.  Now at 63,000 miles, the air conditioner stopped working so I took it back to Don Herring for service.  Noting the high miles had pushed me past warranty and that I had not purchased an extended warranty, the service department began their assessment of the problem.  It was nearly a total AC failure and the price to fix it was determined to be $2600.00.  Of course I was not happy with this but needed the AC fixed and even with the high price I wanted the Mitsubishi backing on the work so I told them to proceed.  I got a phone call the next evening explaining to me that they had a management meeting concerning my issue and they were not happy that my AC had failed and that I was being hit with a high maintenance bill on a Mitsubishi car that was less than 2 years old.  They decided to offer me an alternative. If I would purchase the normal 60,000 mile comprehensive maintenance package (even though I was past 60,000) for the price after tax of $675.00, they would take care of the AC free of charge.  I wasn't sure of what I was hearing on the phone so I repeated it back to him, ""I pay $675. instead of $2600.00 and I get all that extra maintenance and Don Herring is going to pay for all the parts and labor to totally repair my AC.""  Ebby said that's right all you have to do is tell me to start.  No brainer - I told him to start. They wound up replacing 98% of the entire AC system and the final tab that they picked up was not $2600.00, but $3,500.00 after the dust settled.  In addition to the new AC system, the car is now running noticeably better.  If you have had AC repairs done before, beyond a re-charge, you know it is always several hundred dollars; but to get the entire system changed out with new parts, installed by dealer master mechanics and a comprehensive maintenance package for $675.00; without a warranty pushing them to do it is UNHEARD of.  This is the second Mitsubishi Lancer I have owned and I have to tell you they will run to the end of the earth and back for you several times - and if you buy it from Don Herring in Irving TX you won't get dropped after the sale if something really uncharacteristic for Mitsubishi performance happens to you.  Don Herring, along with his maintenance and sales staff had a special meeting just to discuss my case and decided eating $3500.00 was the right thing to do.  If Don Herring in Irving seems too far for you to drive, I would recommend you do it anyway - buy your car from these guys!!!",5.0

Now please understand we live about 2 hours away so we are trying to accomplish this over the phone which is difficult as it is. So I decide to call about the used Outlander in Irving and spoke with a man named Corey who stated that our credit was never run on Saturday(we gave all our information to the Plano office on Saturday).I provided all this and advised that we didn't want to drive there without knowing what the numbers would be and if we could get a rough estimate. Now knowing car dealerships unless your in front of them your not there but for us its a drive and I am just asking for numbers to be run. He comes back asks what our pay off is and all the general questions and I am still asking what numbers they are running to the bank-I still am getting not one number but the price of the car as its listed. Now that cannot be the number provided to the bank. He tells me its his boss that sent it and he doesn't know. So this time his boss Brett answers he puts me on hold then Corey calls on my other line and asks of they have me on hold on the other line and to just hang up with them and tells me the bank said no. I ask him why. He advises me he doesn't know his boss Brett knows, I ask him what numbers did they run, he doesn't know his boss knows but they ran the price of the car. Now I spoke to him I advised him I had a trade and that it had to be run as a trade and not as a 3rd car loan because it wouldn't work. And I knew that ahead of time. I kept getting I don't know and my boss answers. When a customer is asking these questions knowing they have not been turned down and ""the boss"" puts you on hold so the associate can explain or better say not explain anything on the way it was submitted to the bank sure does not make you feel good about doing business with that particular location.",2.3
