0,"May 15, 2020","I went into the dealership to get an oil change and they had it done in no time.  After they told me that it was ready to go, I paid them and thanked them for being so quick.  They did a very good job and everyone I spoke to was very polite.  ",5.0

2,"April 07, 2020","We selected a new vehicle from their website.  After multiple calls and emails back and forth discussing the vehicle, pricing options etc. we went to the dealership with aspirations of buying the vehicle.  But when we got there, the vehicle (reported as new) had several thousand miles on that they had not previously disclosed to us in any conversations.  It had BROKEN mechanical parts, dings, scratches etc. and was filthy.  When I commented on it, the Sales rep told me the Manager's wife had been driving it.  That is NOT a new car, I said.  The manager said that by Texas law it has never been titled, so it is indeed a new car.  WHAT?!?  Worse, he wasn't willing to offer any of the discounts that he promised in email.  The price actually increased after we got there by a couple thousand dollars.  He stated that the discount was only good through the end of March, but the workup form he sent me with the discount included was dated March 31st.  Yet, after showing him that, he still refused to honor it or to work with us and said he couldn't afford take anything less.  Really, just 5 days later??? He should have been offering us even more considering the shape of the car!  He was unprofessional and rude.  I feel like he was trying to scam us and I would never consider buying anything from them.  I am glad I didn't fall for it...  I found basically the same car, with only 40 miles, pristine condition and with more option packages for very little additional cost at another dealer.  ",1.0

12,"February 27, 2019","When you move from out of state, dealers often put you at the bottom of the pile when servicing a vehicle not purchased from them. Not here! These folks always treated us well, did the work correctly, and treated us like family. When time came to replace our F150, we got the same attention and, never felt rushed, pressured, or cheated. The salesperson took time to find the right F250 for our needs, and the finance staff was very complete and thorough. The only car buying experience where I felt great afterwards!",5.0

I will be a loyal customer at Gabriel/Jordan Ford for life. Mrs Hali Crow is very professional and a genuine, caring person. If you're looking...do yourself a favor and give them the opportunity to earn your business.",5.0

18,"December 14, 2012","Poor business practice with sales tax and completing a sale vs. rataining who would have been a loyal customer. Agreed on an out-the-door price and received notification 2 wks later more money was owed due to ""error on sales tax"" for my particular state. Oh well. Take this for what it's worth.",2.3
19,"December 17, 2011","I took my Mothers 2001 Mercury grand marquis into sevice. Needed ball joints and alighnment.
The service writer wrote down exactly what I told him. We wanted ball joints that were the greasable type. Also as for alighnment the car was pulling to the right.

When the car was ready Danny called me. He informed me the transmision fliud was very dark and the rear axle cover was leaking. I expected some upsale. It happens. Before my father passed away he had the trans serviced. Next service on the transmission wouldnt be until another 15K miles.
I asked danny how much to seal the rear cover. He said $168 parts and labor. So we passed on that. I can do that myself. Which I did for $25 parts and 30 minutes labor.

I asked Danny when we picked the car up. How do they warranty the alighnment. His answer was. You might leave here and hit a pot hole. Very tacky IMO. I expected him to say If your not satisfied in the next day or so, bring it back. 

On the way home the car was still pulling to the right. So I looked under it And found that they did not use the greaseable type ball joints. Even though it was on the work order.

As far as the pulling to the right I rotated the tires and it stoped pulling. The tech did not finnish the job. I have had alighnments before. When the car is still pulling. They researched it in more depth. The tech would tell me they rotated the tires to make it stop. If this was the problem. So this tells me all they did was park it not test drive it.

I called Danny about the non greaseable ball joints. He said, there are plugs in there. you will have to install the grease zerts. I informed him, there are no plugs for zerts. The he apologized and offered a free oil change. I had just changed the oil. So I asked him, how about sealing the axle cover. He said if we furnish the parts. They would furnish the labor. As I said above. $25 parts and my 30 minute labor. Was not worth driving back 25miles to the dealer. If you are trying to make up to a customer you dont ask them to buy $25 in parts for 30 minutes of simple labor.

During this conversation. He insisted again, the trans oil was very dark and needed changing. I didnt tell tell him, this was a lie. I had already drawn a sample with my sihphon from the pan. The oil was very normal red when I squeezed my sample onto a white paper towel.

Im a 61yr old gear head. Worked on and been building cars since 16. You cant lie to me. They did not do the work as written on the work order. Nor follow up if the car was still pulling to the right after alighnment. Lied to about the tranmission fluid. Made a dumb offer to seal the rear axle cover.

I will have to find an independent for the heavy work I dont do any longer. 
the only other Ford dealer close to my Mother is in Cleavland, Tx. My Father found out the new 2001 car he bought wasnt new. He was the second owner. It had 168 miles on it and wasnt a demo. Dealership told him the millage was on there 'cause it was driven from another dealership. He found this out years later from Fords own service records. Then he looked at the window sticker, he saved. It was delivered to the clevland dealership. LIEs on top of LIEs. At both local dealerships, to my mother.
It is a shame that you cant trust. ",2.6
