They are terrible people.  They reached out to me.  After I said I wasn’t looking unless they had  a good deal they came up with one and we called and emailed me all day.  We agreed on a price, and they agreed on a price for my trade, and then they charged $500 to hold my vehicle.  The next morning I got up and drove two hours to their dealership only to find out that they let my truck get sold out from under me.   They could not find another but we’re going to make it right.   They found me one, but I was going to need to come up with $1-2000 on the final price.      I asked to speak to the owner and he was too busy to speak with me.  Bait and switch shop and do not care.  They knew they screwed up and had no intentions to make up for it.  You are just someone who walked in.  I was 100% honest with them and kept my word 100%. They lied and did not honor their quotes.    Sorry sorry people.  Blake and Brenda were supposed to be the best people and willing to make a deal but they will get you in the door and not have your vehicle.

They then called me and said it was my fault for being so picky and having such high demands.  Great people for telling the customer they are wrong ",1.0
1,"December 12, 2019","Worst dealership in state of Texas. 45 days after purchase, I am making my second payment on my truck I traded in, about $1,000 total I should not of had to pay.  They tell me that I will get it all back from the  company I financed my trade in through.  Not the point, they are supposed to pay off your trade, have it in writing. Lie to me about it as well.  Still not paid off.  Promised floor mats in writing, still no floor mats.  They tell me they have been ""back ordered"".  30 days after purchase the check engine light comes on, another $1,000 plus in repairs. Sales Manager is a joke. I would not buy a Hot Wheel from them, even if they offered two for a dollar. Do not go to this dealership. ",1.2

3,"October 03, 2019","I never visit a dealership without first negotiating the final price and confirming. I gave Bossier CDJ a chance to bid on the vehichle, and without even giving a price, they used foul language and yelled that I would even attempt to ""steal"" from them.

Obviously this dealership is struggling financially, and they only survive by preying on those that do not know better.

There are many options in nearby cities, and there is no reason to waste time at this dealership.",1.0
4,"May 29, 2019","My wife wanted a particular make and model that this dealer didn't have on the lot. Shannon was our sales lady warm and friendly personality almost like we've known her for years.  She was persistent  and attentive to what my wife wanted all the way til we found it.  I highly recommend this dealer they treated us very well in all aspects they will have my future business.

5,"November 15, 2018","Worst dealership ever. Purchased ram 2500 9.10.18....as of 11.15.18 still dont have my new plates. Temp plates expired. Very shady sales manager. They use a lot of shady sales tactics which i called them out on and my salesperson agreed with me but said it is policy....my ram was supposedly certified. It had broken seat belts, no coolant in engine, not detailed, smelled terrible, missing parts to jack set, no service records provided, tires inflated to twice the max rating, no cabin air filter, squeaking brakes, rattling ac fan.....when i called about the issues i was told by the sales manager, ""i guess we are even"" then he told me i mislead them on a service light on my trade in even though i provided paperwork from 3rd party ASE mechanic regarding error code and replacement estimate.....the sales manager told me the cost would be 4 times the quote......they also told me they completed recall repairs on my new truck but at my first oil change at a different dealership it hadnt been done....they took 2 months to pay off my trade in resulting in me getting charged late fees and toll charges for a vehicle i no longer own......now when i call bossier no one will let me talk to the general manager....no one will call me back.",1.4

7,"November 02, 2018","From the time I walked through the door in May 2017 to this very day 11/02/18 I have been lied to and ripped off.  They told me I was purchasing a Mopar Max Care Warranty to later find out that I had been sold an Allstate worthless warranty.  My rear ac went out at 2500 miles Chrysler refused to fix due to it being outside elements that caused the breakage.  So I had to pay to repair a manufactures warranty item.  Then it went out again in 2500 miles.  I was promised a referral fee for bringing a new customer, how stupid was I, and still nothing.  They will not return phone calls. Once that sale is made you are nothing, not even a number.  Then they mess up your credit by profiling you with someone else instead of your spouse.  Nothing but crooks and lies.",1.0
8,"October 30, 2018","The sales rep, Ben Mosqueda, took his time and allowed me to look at several vehicles.

15,"July 19, 2018","February 7, 2018 put a $500 deposit on 2005 Audi A4, to hold car until income tax refund was obtained. We explained we were not sure when our refund would show up and we were told they would hold the car with no problem. Right from the beginning we were told the car would be delivered to our home with no trouble, as we live 4 hours from the dealership. March 7th we are asked for a second deposit to hold car, which we did. During our wait on tax refund, we told Matt to sell the car a total of four times, as he was pressuring us to come up with more and more money. Each time he would refuse and say he wanted us to have the car. March 29th we obtained a cashiers check in the total amount owed on the car and delivery was scheduled to be delivered March 31st. At 9:56 a.m. March 31st we received a call from Matt stating they would not deliver the car and we would need to go pick it up. Again we told them to sell the car and we would not be coming to get the car. As we were told it would be delivered to our home from the beginning. They ended up delivering the car April 5th with one blown tire and four others that were in such bad shape no reputable place would have passed it for inspection. The crack on the side of the tires is so deep you can put a coin in it and wires are visible. However the car was inspected and passed for registration by Bossier Dodge. The temporary deaer tag expired April 20th. When you buy a car from a dealer the tags should last way longer than 15 days. At time of delivery we called Matt and was told we would get one new tire to replace the one that had blown out. As of this date July 19, 2018 we still have not received a tire. We have bought four other new tires. The car had a few minor issues, such as radiator fluid leaking and an oil leak from the oil filter. But we have fixed those issues. The car has not been driven since we received it. We will not drive it without a spare. It is still sitting in the garage collecting dust. 

Long story short, do not believe anything these people tell you. Especially Matt. This is by far the worst car buying experience we have ever had. ",1.6

17,"June 08, 2018","Been buying vehicles from this dealership for years starting in 1996.  Charlie West, West Side, Outletmall Autoplex, Hillsboro Autoplex, now Bossier.  It's had a few owners over the years to say the least.  I don't recommend anyone do business here due to the current group running the show.  They care less about the person, whether they work there or just come in off the street, and more about how much they can squeeze you for, in both regards.  Back in the day, there was one dealer here in Hillsboro owned by a good man, JJ Dobbs.  Honest as the day is long.  Are there any car dealerships left with that same platform??? Doesn't seem like it.  Do what you want, but I won't be going back to Bossier.  I do however wis them luck, they're going to need it.",1.0
18,"May 05, 2018","My credit score WAS 700 + they ran my credit 33 times dropped my scoreover 100 points then told me I would have to put a bunch of money down!!  After hiring an attorney to dispute the 33 inquiries I was informed by several of the banks that I was approved SEVERAL TIMES WITH zero to 4.75  interest  but I guess they cant get a bunch of money down doing business with people that have good credit.  buy a new truck every 3 years, I’ve NEVER had an issue at the ford house in West, Tex.  These folks are crooked crooked crooked STAY AWAY FROM BOSSIER, they will screw you to the moon and back. ruin your credit and lie lie lie lie lie. I’m getting documentation together to turn over to the board.

23,"March 05, 2018",Very unprofessional service and very unorganized. The sales and finance department are all over the place. The day we did the signing of paperwork there had been a verbal agreement of down payment. In the next week or 2 the sales rep called saying they needed additional money towards down payment that it had not been paid in full. Come to find out the paperwork did not reflect what was previously agreed upon. Another issue was that in the weeks following the purchase of the vehicle they started requesting documents that was already supplied to them during signing of paperwork. They informed us that if they didn't have these they couldn't get funded for the vehicle which was a total contradiction of what sales rep had previously told us in a different conversation when he informed us that they had been funded already. Then as the weeks continued they informed us that they had to have us redo paperwork cause they sent it to wrong bank and haven't been funded for vehicle. They don't seem to know what they are doing. We have had vehicle for over a month and still don't have a payment agreement set up and have been trying to give the vehicle back due to all the confusion they have caused. All they have been doing is prolonging the situation and not communicating with us. We are lucky if they even return a phone call.  Bottom line we want our money back and to take our business elsewhere.,2.0

31,"December 20, 2017","Bossier Chrysler Jeep Dodge RAM Is VERY GREEDY, to start I have purchased a new truck, my father has purchesded 3 new trucks and my two brother in laws both purchased a truck all in the last two years. BUT      On 10/20/17 I ordered a truck at the dealership, I own a 2017 Dodge Ram and was trading it for 2018 Dodge Ram, I purchased my 2017 Dodge Ram from Bossier Chrysler Jeep Dodge RAM in 2016 and told them I would return a year later and trade for a 2018 model, so on 10/20/17 I proceeded to order a new truck but they wanted me to put down a $1,000 deposit, and I foolishly went along with it, so 8 weeks later the truck I ordered came in but in the process of negotiating a price I ran into some unexpected expenses. I contacted the dealership on 12/20/17 to tell them I would not be able to move forward with trading trucks as I could not afford the trade difference at this time and I could not take on any new debt. I reminded my sales person that they had $1,000 of my money and I asked if they would apply that to a new set of tires at there store for my 2017 truck, I suppose I could ask for a full refund, But they plain and simply told me no if I didn’t take the truck I wasn’t going to get my $1,000 back.

I made an appointment and I will have it done so I will still have a warranty, However I will be finding another dealership for any further business. Guess I should have picked up on the poor customer service when i was left waiting to pick up the vehicle after signing the papers for over (4) four hours was told for my patience they would fill the diesel and got 1/4 of the way home and realized the tank was on 1/4 full.

97,"May 16, 2017",In November of 2016 I bought a Dodge Dart from Bossier and I was very pleased with the experience. In the first quarter of 2017 after some personal issues with the dealership I swore to never do business with them again. In March of 2017 I was contacted by salesman Tanner Crawford and one week later by salesmen Mario Meza. Both men told me that they wanted to get me out of my Dart and into something newer. Since I have never had any issues with the sales department I decided to give them a try. I went to the dealership and told them what I could afford in the sense of a monthly payment. They worked extremely hard and the sales department as a whole made me feel like family. Tanner knew that I would not spend much more money and we test drove 5 vehicles. The original vehicle I wanted did not work out but in the end I drove off the lot in a brand new Jeep Cherokee that I am very happy with. The whole experience was quick and streamlined and did not take long considering my specific requests. All and all I would recommend the Bossier sales department and I would by another vehicle from Tanner in the future. ,5.0

The add in the paper was clear on a particular vehicle for a particular price with specific discounts and rebates.  When I called the dealership from over 100 miles away, I asked if this specific vehicle was still in stock.  Juan went to great lengths to convince me that that vehicle was still ""in stock"".  I drove over 2 hours and was met at the door by Juan.  Juan immediately told me that the vehicle featured in the ad was no longer available.  He wanted to show me a comparable vehicle that was actually listed at a lower MSRP.  Against my better judgement I allowed him to do that.  The vehicle seemed alright, so I told him we would see what he could do.  That's when the real tricks started.  After several minutes of bull____, I got up to leave.  The sales manager then came out and, after several minutes agreed to honor the advertised price.  I'm not a fool, and realize that they got what they wanted, they sold a car.  But what they don't understand is that I will probably buy another 5 to 6 vehicles in my lifetime, however none of them will be from a Bossier dealership.  I will also take every opportunity to share by experience with everyone I know.  I got the vehicle, but it took way too much wrangling.
