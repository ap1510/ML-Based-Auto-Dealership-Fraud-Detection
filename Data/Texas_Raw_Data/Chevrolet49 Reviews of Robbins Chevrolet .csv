3,"June 07, 2019", I recently purchased a new 2019 Camaro and was unsure if I should since I have been driving have only owned Chevy Trucks. Only bought from Robbins Chevrolet. Marcus worked with me in my decision never putting any pressure on me and making sure that I was doing and getting what I wanted not just something that was on that lot. He showed great patience with me. As the whole purchase process took me about 2 months because I could not make up my mind . But once I decided to go for it and purchase the Camaro we sat down had a conversation about what I was looking for and wanted. Marcus went right to work to find what I wanted and 3 days later I was driving home in a Brand New Camaro(2019). Could not be any happier with the service I received. Thanks to Marcus and the whole Robbins family for making me feel like I was part of the family.,5.0

5,"April 02, 2019","First time purchasing/financing a vehicle. It was really easy, I thought it would take me all day. Salesman (Marcus Prado) was very helpful, worked the deal over the phone and just came to sign. Finance (Joe Gomero) explain every detail on the deal. Everything was clear. Ana was very helpful too, help me understand the different SUVs. End up purchasing a TRAVERSE, which I love!! I'll recommend Robbins to family and friends. Great service and awesome people! 

Thank you Robbins!!! ",5.0
6,"April 01, 2019","I first bought my 2017 Chevy Silverado 1500 from John & Tyler Boda. The next year I received a private offer from GM for my truck. I went to the dealership to take a look at the 2500 Duramax Sport Edition and fell in love. I had my heart set on that trim level- but when working the #'s, Matrix mentioned I could get the TOP OF THE LINE- High Country for not too much of a difference. I wasn't too interested, but once I saw the interior and value I had to have it. Thanks Matrix for your expertise and suggestion! I will continue to buy all our vehicles from here Robbins Chevrolet",5.0
7,"March 30, 2019","Mr. Jimenez went above and beyond to make sure I purchased the car I was most comfortable with. He gave me suggestions and his advice. So far one of my most amazing salesman and would love to do business with him in the future! Very friendly dealership, would definitely recommend it. ",5.0
8,"March 29, 2019",I had been looking for a sports car for some time because of my young age no one at any other dealership would attend me right or give me attention but Mr. Parker Lange from the moment I got there gave me his full attention and full interest he was very knowledgeable and answered all the questions I had we found the car that was right from me. Any help i need with my car I ask him and he responds in minutes never have met a salesman as great as he is. ,5.0

He made sure I knew every important detail about the vehicle and made sure I was informed. I will be coming back to buy the car for sure.

12,"January 11, 2019","Will never purchase here again.  The sales experience was ok this time, but service was horrible.  I was treated so badly when came in to check a problem with my brand new 2018 vehicle.  I had to go to two other automotive establishments who told me the same thing - and upon bring to robbins I had to leave my vehicle for them to check.  That was fine.  They said it would be back that afternoon.  Well the afternoon came and no call.  The next day came and no call.  I look up my tracker and find out that my brand new 5000 miles truck has been driven around to Walmart, restaurants and someones house.  It had been driven over 30 miles.  I called and said I wanted my vehicle back now.  They said they had not looked at it.  This has now been two days.  Finally upon demand the afternoon of the 2nd day I said I was picking it up and it better be there.  They said nothing was wrong with it and they wont warranty any part of it anyway because we put a lift on the truck so the entire warranty was void.  Horrible dealer - never deal with again.  They said even if I paid they will not service the vehicle - THis is a brand new 4x4 supercab truck.  Horrible dealer.  If I could give a 0 I would.  ",1.0
13,"January 04, 2019"," Sales people were courteous and engaging and patient while my wife and I worked out what we wanted out of the vehicle. pricing was not favorable.  The finance person found a bank at a good rate. I was offered roughly 60% of the value of my trade-in which I had gotten two independent appraisals on and they grudgingly conceded a $5000 increase in the trade. the Pricing was informal and confusing, having me initial documents and not getting copies.  when I attempted to understand the difference between the sticker price and the price I paid. later on, I got the runaround by the business manager. I felt like I was played. Note to self - keep a worksheet and copies of anything signed during the negotiation, use a buying service and be prepared to walk",2.6
14,"November 26, 2018","First they “lost the inspection paper” or more like forgot to do it. Received a phone call about two weeks from when the buyers tag paper plates expired that they were going to mail our plates to us. Our buyer tag paper plates are now expired. Plates are no where to be found and it seems as if we’re getting the run around. Josh (used cars manager) is also extremely rude and does not have customer service. When I told him the situation he responded, “let’s just blame it on the post office”. Biggest joke of my life. Worst car buying experience ever. ",1.0
15,"July 18, 2018","I purchased a vehicle from Robbins Chevrolet in October 2017.   My salesman was Muin Ahmed.  He did a great job and sold me the vehicle I requested.   On July 13, 2018, I contacted Mr. Ahmed advising him I was interested in trading in my vehicle for another vehicle.  He responded that day by emailing, ""Happy and honored to hear from you, will get on it right away and let you know""  Did receive an email requesting mileage on my vehicle.  Since that day never heard another word from him and my emails ignored.

FYI... I highlighted 1 star because that is required to continue.  Finally, I will not comment on any other associate or service at Robbins, only Mr. Ahmed's failure to communicate.",1.0
16,"June 02, 2018","They offered me half of what my car blue booked for. Had to walk out before they took me serious. Was there until midnight arguing over the truck before we came to an agreement. Then I schedule warranty/recall work and they didn’t even have the parts to do the repair and I live an hour and a half away. They closed early on me so I lost all my travel time as well as now I’ll have to take off work to drop off their rental to get mine back, and still have to come back to get the work done. ",1.4
17,"May 02, 2018",A/C went out again first time was in 2016 was the compressor. Was not charged a dollar it was under warranty. 2 days ago a/c went out again. Was told it had a leak in the a/c condenser coil was told it would cost $1300  xxx I think I got robbed. Will never go back for repairs again big mistake on my part. Don't ever take your car there if it's out of warranty.,3.2

20,"October 12, 2017","We want to thank Muin Ahmed & Robbins  Chevrolet for the great customer service that they provided. This is the 3rd Chevrolet we've bought at Robbins Chevrolet with Muin Ahmed. Muin was so nice to give us leather seats for the price without leather seats & free pin striping on the car. Robbins  also matched our Credit Union finance rate so we didn't have to refinance. We wouldn't go anywhere else. When it's time to buy next vehicle, we will go back to Muin Ahmed at Robbins Chevrolet. Bill & Gail",5.0
21,"October 10, 2017",I was extremely please with the attentive and professional service provided by my salesman Marcus Lofton. Mr. Lofton is very knowledgeable of his job and made me feel very comfortable. I have limited finances and credit and he made magic happen for me. I will refer people to Mr. Lofton anytime and i will most definitely be a return customer. He also was a tremendous help to me when I needed to get my first all change. He was able to assist me in getting my car services very quickly. I was in and out before I went to work. Mr. Lofton has my stamp of approval for professionalism and knowledge of cars. He goes above and beyond his call of duty.,5.0
22,"February 23, 2017","Worst sales experience ever. I had a pre-approved Capital One offer, they ran my credit over 12 times and even running it as my maiden name with punctuation and my full middle name, when I never even gave them my maiden name! Never once coming and saying I had a great deal already from Cap One but actually saying it wasn't real with a sheet they printed that I later found out from Cap One that they entered in random info to get to print out! You can believe that I was educated as to the numbers I wanted but never expected to be handled as we were or was I prepared for the plays they were throwing at us but it took us walking away and going to another dealership to truly see the fraud and scam they were playing. When I look back who could prepare themselves for this? Don't buy into the ""manager"" calling to check on you either; it's a ploy to get the final sales pitch in with promises. Don't buy into all their shiny deals and free stuff they push when they see you ask too many questions on the hard numbers. Demand black and white and when they won't show it, leave. When I asked I was made to feel stupid and told they just didn't have they spaces on the paper to show our GM Family discount or rebates. Sad to have been a GM family customer on top of it all and be treated as such. I have only begun my voice on this because now after working so hard to keep my credit clean they have bombarded it. Save your money and your respect and go outside our city limits to people who don’t have to tell you they are honest, “straight shooters” as we heard. We went to Conroe, Buckalew Chevrolet, and drove out with a brand new 2017 Tahoe with only 2 miles on it, in less than 3 hours ...nothing like the 216 mile one they were pushing on us that they drove around town, but hey they ""promised"" us free leather, not, even then it wasn't free. Be smart and if you are feeling disrespected trust your gut, walk away, and really evaluate the situation. They may do this to everyone and maybe not but being that so many walk through their door; it's nothing to lose a few if they can't make a large profit. Horrible way to handle anybody and ruined my new car buying experience but it made me appreciate the buy from Buckalew even more so I guess I can thank them for that. I will never ever buy from or use Robbins to service my new Chevrolet vehicle and will be sure I tell everyone who asks my opinion.",1.0
23,"December 03, 2016","Had my vehicle repaired and done quickly! Why? Because they just want to make a buck and don't perform quality tests that find the cause of the problem.  ""We replaced your sensor and the service light went off.""  What caused the sensor to fail? They replied with ""likely"" and ""generally"".  What testing did y'all perform? Can I see what was done so this isn't a reoccurring problem? ""Uh we don't keep track of that and cannot provide any paperwork on it."" 2 DTCs turned into 5.  What does P0121 refer to? Is that the Throttle Position Sensor? ""No.""....Called another dealership and it IS in fact due to the TPS, which they did not test because they want a quick buck! Well my ""bad"" sensor is on it's way to have microscopic diagnostics performed from a 3rd party. Better cross your fingers Robbins!

24,"November 08, 2016","Experience with service here is terrible!!! Every time i have taken my vehicle there for service they give it back in worse condition than when i dropped it off. Recently I had it at the body shop and when i got it back there was wet sand residue all over my interior and it is still there, my fuel door wasnt flush with the body, a trim panel was hanging off, my door wasnt aligned correctly and the rubber cover for the door witing to the body was broken. They fixed the majority without issue but i should not have got it back in that condition. They didnt want to replace the plastic piece to hold the wire cover to the body until i asked to speak to the general manager and they just took it off of a totaled car and put it on mine. With this and previous service that was about the same, i would never recommend anyone go to this dealer for service. Car buying experience was top notch.",1.0

26,"July 17, 2016","I was hoping to purchase a 2017 Chevy High Desert (upon their arrival) from Robbins Chevrolet. Due to the service I received on my 2013 Avalanche Black Diamond which I purchased from Robbins Chevrolet I will purchase the High Desert from another dealer. Robbins service department is less than forthright. With BBB rating of F, I should have been leery. But I chose Robbins because they were very near my home and thought servicing my vehicle would be convenient. I was wrong. The service department rep misled me into thinking their repairs didn't cause the other problems with my vehicle. First the driver side inside door closing handle molded into the door panel broke. The service department repaired it by replacing the entire door panel at no cost to me (repair was under warranty). The new panel was not properly installed and caused damage to the rubber strip below the door. Robbins would not fix it without cost because the strip was not in the scope of work to repair the broken panel handle. Second the driver side exterior plastic door handle opening mechanism stopped working. I informed the service rep that it was working properly before they changed the door panel. Again I was told the panel replacement had nothing to do with the door opening mechanism. So I paid to have the mechanism repaired. The next day I brought the Avalanche back because the driver side door was not opening and closing properly. I was told it was the door hinge and it would cost $200 + parts. The manager refused to believe it was connected to the door panel. Frustrated I left the service department and on a whim stopped at a local mechanic shop. Within literally one minute the mechanic said the panel was not installed properly as evident with the damaged rubber strip. Within the next five minutes he adjusted the panel clips. Afterwards the door was opening and closing properly. Cost for repair $5.00. The local mechanic said if the door panel is not properly installed it would cause problems with the door moving parts (door opening mechanism). I concluded either the service reps are not qualified to assess required repairs, or the mechanics at Robbins are not qualified mechanics, or the service reps deliberately misled to milk more money from customers.

30,"January 12, 2016","STAY AWAY !!!! LIARS..VERY UNETHICAL ""
This was one of the worst experiences of my life. I took my vehicle in for a simply oil change, 30 minutes later I was advised that I needed a new motor(Ive NEVER had ANY issues with this vehicle 2012  Camero. I had to plead with the director for a rental he was very rude and but finally realized that providing a rental was the right thing to do. When I picked up my vehicle (post) new engine I had to bring it immediately back to have the air extracted out of the steering , 1 week later I had to bring it back once again for a loose hose that service forgot to hook back up, 7 days later the car started dying on dangerous roadways along with many other problems. I brought it back and explained that I should not be experiencing all of these issues (after all a new engine was just put in 4 weeks ago). The  advisor stated that the vehicle could not be looked at for at least 10 days (????)  REALLY??? I was almost killed on 249 when the engine THAT YOU ""JUST"" PUT IN DIED while I was on the road way!!!!! And you want me to wait 10 days????? that’s when I requested to talk to the (supervisor) he advised me that it was not their fault of the engine  and it would only be worked on if I payed for service and transportation CERTAINLY would not be provided while the vehicle was being serviced (all of these issues within a month of a new $6,800 engine) (UN ACCEPTABLE!!) THEN after all of this the crew commented that I should not be upset because I didn’t have to pay for it. (Warranty) REALLY DID THEY JUST SAY THAT????? I called Ricky Bishop (the General Manger )to let him know about the issues and about accountability -he was very obnoxious and a liar, he said that his service dept. told him the there were other issues and actually hug up in my face and told me he is refusing to see the car at his dealership PERIOD! I then called Mr. Robbins , one of the owners , he would not even talk to me- he had Ricky Bishop call me back, all of a sudden Bishop offered to see the vehicle (if I pay) again he informed me that the dealership would not provide transportation(previous conversation)  I told him that I had missed work he said that’s not his problem….After this experience I was curious about what others had to say about their experiences. And WOW several had some of the same issues!!!!!. They are horrible, unethical liars, BE AWARE AND PLEASE , PLEASE  STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

31,"December 16, 2015","I recently inquired about a 2016 Camaro Robbins Chevrolet had received. I called to make sure they had it in stock and was directed to speak to Marcus. He told me they are asking above sticker price by 2k ( I saw it listed 8k OVER sticker from them on another site) and I said I would not pay over sticker. Marcus understood and we hung up only to have Angel Call back in minutes.We NEGOTIATED but stopped over the phone down to $400 over sticker Angel suggested I come  in tonight to make sure it is the ""one"". It was until they gave me a ridiculous low ball offer on my 2013 Camaro that was  obviously to make up the difference in the price. We all know dealers prices can be low but not 8k low AND on the buyers order the new car price was well over what we had had stopped negotiating at.They said the low price was because ""on that Camaro they did not know I was going to have a trade in"" They did not allow a counter offer nor were they willing to reduce any of their numbers. Angel, that recommended me to come out NEVER came to greet me. Marcus even mentioned "" I stayed here 3 extra hours waiting on you and we had cash offers on this car"" I told Marcus ""tell Angel thanks for wasting my time"" as I hurried home and drove an hour myself just to see this car and to be treated this way. This Dealership is the exact reason you should shop around. If more people shop around they will avoid Robbins Chevrolet for lack of customer service and poor sales knowledge.. A Chevrolet is a Chevrolet but customer service is what sells the cars. They failed horribly, Skip Robbins Chevrolet on your list and go ANYWHERE ELSE. WHAT A JOKE THIS PLACE IS ",1.6
32,"September 17, 2015","Poor customer service, poor communication, poor call back.  Manager never returned call.  .Don't waste your time. There was no cohesion among Salesmen staff.  They would spit all over the ground, infront of us. No professionalism, no class,  poor business ethics. Completed an application and was never shown credit report.

33,"July 10, 2015","We had a really bad experience with the sservice and service manager.  They replaced a transmission a month ago under warranty, but not the flywheel and clutch plate. 10 days ago, the car stopped shifting altogether and began smoking.  This turned out to be because the flywheel came apart.   That part was covered too, but they said that we needed a starter and had to have it immediately, because the one in there was ""weak""and it would ruin the new flywheel.   A price was given and we agreed, asking them to save the part.  When we went to pick it up, the amount was $100 over the phone estimate, with no explanation.  It was taken off when my husband challenged it.  I think this was a ""girl tax"" where they saw a female name (my niece) on the invoice and figured they could get away with it.  I'll bet they do it a lot.  Then, there turned out to be nothing wrong with the starter! The invoice said that the gear was worn on the starter. It was not. We had it tested--the amps were fine, not ""weak.""  Then they said that there was a service bulletin and that was why.  There is no bulletin--and if there was, it should have been covered by an extension of the warranty, like they did for water pumps.  We called GM and they transferred back to them.  They agreed to a refund if my husband came in with the receipt.  The service manager treated my husband like he was some kind of thief, saying ""are you calling me a liar"" and telling him never to come back.  He did not need him to come in--he just wanted  a confrontation.  If Robbins had a real reason for the replacement, a professional service manager should have been able to calmly explain it.  He tried to start crap to cover up their fraud as far as I'm concerned.  WOMEN BEWARE--I think that the female name is what made them think that they could get away with this.",1.2
34,"July 06, 2015","  Last week my 2012 Sonic had a problem with the flywheel and it burned up my clutch. I towed it over 50 miles to Robbins Chevrolet because they are the closest dealer to my home. That problem was handled at no cost to me under GMs 100,000 mile powertrain warranty. So anyway, I get a call from my service advisor to inform me that my starter was ""weak"" and it needed to be replaced. I told him thank you and that I would fix that problem myself. I was told if I didn't replace the starter then that i would not be able to drive it, so I gave the approval to do the repair for $510.48 and for them to give me the faulty starter. When my car was ready to pick up the invoice was over $100 more than what I approved. I complained and it was immediately fixed. The invoice said that ""the starter drive gear was worn"" I looked at the gear and didn't see any wear. I asked the service director to show me the wear and he brought in the techician and i was told that the starter did not have enough Torque to turn the motor. If you are keeping count, that is 3 different stories. So today i called the dealership   and the Service Director said he would refund my money on the repair since I was not happy. When I showed up to get my refund He told me he would give my money back and in return I am not to return to his shop again. So I won't.

Finally when I was told to bring it in for the repair, the only thing that seemed important to the people working in  the service area was the money they got.  They ""lost"" my car for a day and a half, never told me it was found, fixed my car a day later than promised and treated me like I had a terrible disease when I came in for my car.  They merely pointed to the cashier when I entered.  I do believe an apology should have been given for a phone message telling me they couldn't find my car and for not locking it over night.

There is nothing efficient about their buying process. Salesman should have put me in the car I was going to test drive while they were appraising my trade in but he didn't. We didn't even get to talk price of the new car because I was so frustrated with them I had to leave.  I wouldn't buy a car from this dealership if they were the only one that had the perfect car.

41,"August 22, 2013","I have a 2011 Suburban with 33k miles. A while back (around 10k miles), my passenger side mirror started going from the settings I had it set to, to the full out position intermittently when using the remote to unlock the doors. I took it to the dealership (Robbins Chevrolet in Houston, TX), and the service manager (Tony) saw it do it himself. They told me to switch remotes (I was using the #2 remote instead of #1, but both of the memories were set to the exact position) and they thought they solved it. It continued to be an issue sparingly, but not all the time. Now, at 33k miles, its doing back to doing it a lot. I took it back to the dealership today and they have refused to fix the problem because I have a aftermarket Alpine radio installed. When this issue was first brought up, everything was completely factory. Factory radio as well. So, this was an issue before and after a aftermarket radio has been installed. Not only has the service manager (Tony) has seen this issue himself, the service advisor (Alex) saw the mirror go to the full out position as well today when I brought it in. Chevrolet is refusing to fix this issue because there is the aftermarket radio installed, even though this issue was occurring before anything extra was put in there. Instead of fixing the problem, they're coming up with excuses and reasons as to why they won't fix it. That is the most frustrating part, I have had this issue before anything was in there, and they refuse to fix it. I have taken it up the ladder to GM's tier 2 for customer satisfaction and they continue to refuse to fix the problem. I will begin to fill out a BBB complaint on GM and Robbins Chevrolet. I write this to caution any prospective buyers out there that Chevrolet will do anything it can to get away from honoring their warranty. I am in the market for a new truck, but this has steered me far away from buying another GM product.",1.5
42,"February 08, 2013","BEWARE. Do not purchase a car here at the used Cheverloet dealership. We were told that the lender was requesting that the price be raised on the vehicle due to our credit. In all reality it was in fact the finance manager that up'd the price. This was verified by contacting the lender and them telling us that they wouldn't ever request that the price be raised. We were in a situation and felt we had no other way out but to sign the contract for the car that we purchased. Not to mention that we were promised parts for the car and still haven't received those parts and it has been over 3 months since we purchased the vehicle. 

They are nice, they put on smiles, but its because they are taking complete advantage of you. Especially when you are someone that honestly needs the help. Their personal bank roll is a little more important. Once the deal is done they won't contact you about their ""we owe"" situations. You have to follow up again, and again, and again. ",1.5

44,"May 28, 2012","April 27, 2012, I bought a brand new 2012 chevy traverse from Robbins Chevrolet. The salesman and the sales manager, I guess he was, were terrible. After they took my truck that I was trading in to be appraised, I had to ask them 5-6 times for my key back. I kept getting the &quot;I left it on my desk&quot; excuse, and his desk was maybe 10 feet away. I hate games and this was 1 big game to them. And even though this was the vehicle I wanted, the salesman did not offer to show me the car, any of the options on the car or my color choices. And when we finally sort of settled on the vehicle price, they only had 1 on the lot for that price. Basically, this is it, take it or leave it. Plates came in about a week later, no phone call, nothing. Until I called them 3 weeks later and the lady who answered said they had been there,they couldn't get a hold of me, messages had been left at the number they had. Except, they had the wrong number, were calling and leaving messages on someone else's phone. apparently, no one bothered to pull paperwork or look in the computer to verify my number or look for my husband's number. And the stupid part is, they had my number wrong because of 1 number.   And now, just under a month later, my new car is going into the shop because of some banging noise under the hood on the driver's side. They have no idea what it is. It has been making this noise from the beginning, my fault for not bringing it in sooner but I should not have to put my new car in the shop after only a month. And no one seems to really care to much. ",1.2
45,"January 04, 2012","I have bought 5 vehicles from Robbins,since 1981. I bought a 2009 truck back in  July.I had a flat tire at the bank in New Caney about 3-4 weeks ago. I could not find the jackhandle or the lug wrench. I called Robbins, and talked to Todd Robinson. He told me it should be with the jack.  When I could not locate it he offered to come and help me.Then I had a problem trying to lower the spare. Now I'm feeling like a dummy.  Todd, and another man from Robbins,came by on their way to lunch.  They found the problem; why the spare wouldn't lower and fixed it. We changed the tire. I told Todd how much I appreicated them coming to help me,when I asked how much I owed them for coming.  He said, come see us next time you need another vehicle. I told him I would, and I will.

46,"December 20, 2011","I have purchased 4 vehicles from Robbins Chevrolet in Humble and each time I have come back and worked with Matrix Watkins. When I went shopping for a new car for my wife, I was recommended by a neighbor to pay Matrix a visit (they too had bought 2 cars from him with high marks). After that first experience, I was sold. Matrix made the car-buying experience what it should be and nothing like what you expect it to be. He was straight-forward and honest and worked to get us the best deal he could. When it came time to sign the paperwork he was with us until the end where the finance department picked up and carried us across the finish line. I have done this 4 times so far and when I need to trade up for a new car again, Matrix at Robbin's will be where I go. Anybody else is 2nd best, period!",5.0
47,"October 08, 2010","My salesman Ryan was great, and I was in and out in less than 2 hours. Way to go Robbins.I will tell everyone I know to shop at Robbins. This was my 2nd car to buy from Ryan, and the Robbins store, and both times I was treated great, and was able to get what I wanted-needed with no hastle at all.",5.0
48,"May 07, 2010","I purchased a 2010 Camaro and was mislead by the salesman, Ken, concerning an option for the vehicle. The dealership agreed to install the option at no charge to me, which I appreciated, at least at first. The salesman had me come into the service department, as I took a day off from work for this, only to find that the part was never ordered. After showing my disgust in the situation, I worked with another manager who ordered the part. So I go in to the dealership today to have the part installed, and they don't have the parts they needed, again. So at this point I have wasted two days, and will have another 10 - 14 day wait before expending even more time.

The first salesman offered to provide me and my wife a dinner if we completed the satisfaction survey indicating he did a great job. He never showed me anything about the car and really did nothing to deserve a good rating. The manager that took over after the salesman today kept relating that he was providing the part for free....of course that wasn't the case or they never would have offered to install it. There is an obvious lack of communication between the service department and the sales personnel. The service department personnel have been as helpful as can be expected, but they have been ""thrown under the bus"". The manager today blamed the service department on ordering the wrong part but I was there when he handed the clerk the paper with part number on it to order.

I asked the manager, Ron, several times to give me a means to contact Mr. Robbins himself, but he refuses to do so. I doubt that Mr. Robbins wants his dealership and his name associated with such poor customer satisfaction. I am continuing to try to find a number of email though.

Just wanted to share my experience with Robbins Chevrolet in Humble and hope no one else has to experience the same poor service.",1.8
