1,"May 13, 2020","Bear in mind that this is during the Covid19 fiasco when you read this.
I took my truck yet to have an issue with the infotainment system diagnosed.
The issue had been persisting for quite some time and I read about it on some forums. Based on those forums oh, I didn't take it into the dealership to have the issue looked at because I didn't feel like anybody can fix it, again based on the forums and those users experiences with their service centers in their area. But the service center here found a hardware issue, and fixed the infotainment system that I thought was not able to be fixed. I am beyond happy with this service center and both their diagnostic and repair capability, and their  outstanding communication during these trying times. They made my whole day once my truck was fixed. Tyler was in constant communication with me and they got the job done way quicker than I thought they would. 
It literally could not have asked for more and they have earned my business in the future.",5.0
2,"March 18, 2020","The intent in writing this review is to save any one considering business transactions with Autonation Dodge in Katy Texas from possible involvement with a similar situation.  This is a 100% true story!

My 84 year old mother brought her 2019 Jeep Cherokee with 2300 miles into this dealership for warranty repair work.  Shortly after dropping the vehicle off, she was contacted by the Service Department and informed that the vehicle had minor scratches and body damage on the passenger side.  No visual inspection was conducted at the time that the vehicle was dropped off.  AutoNation Katy Service representatives are 100% confident that their video surveillance system is state of the art and were able to trace the car throughout the property, they could not show any proof that the damage was on the vehicle upon its arrival.  We are 100% confident that this damage was done at this dealership.  

After a week, my mother was contacted by service and told that the original service issues that she had reported was in fact the result of a collision and that the repairs would cost in excess of $3000.00. While she was confident that she had not run into anything, there pressed the issue and she was left no choice but to file an insurance claim.  After two more weeks, we called to check on the status and were informed that the vehicle was not there and had never been there.  

We contacted the insurance agency to ask for their advice and they suggested taking it to the Service King across the street.  When the vehicle arrived as Service King, they contacted us and stated that the issues that were reported to be the result of a collision were in fact a faulty wheel bearing and that they did not feel comfortable proceeding with an insurance claim as the dealer should have repaired under warranty.   

FCA customer service was contacted and instructed us to take the vehicle to another dealership.  We choose Mac Haik Houston as it was nearby.  Mac Haik received the vehicle, immediately confirmed that it was a faulty wheel bearing and the vehicle has been repaired but will be returned with the Body Damage that AutoNation created. 

We went to great lengths to resolve this in a fair and ethical manner.  Unfortunately the FCA Customer Service Representative assigned to our account was less than helpful, condescending, and simply rude.  The mechanical and electrical issues have been addressed under warranty, however, the body damage remains and FCA Customer Service is not willing to pursue this any further.

The issue remains un-resolved and we will now be pursuing the fraudulent insurance claims with our insurance carrier as they have paid out 30 days of rental coverage, 2 tow truck expenses, and have processed a claim based on the false information provided by Autonation Katy.

This is clearly a case of a service provider taking advantage of the elderly and a clear case of questionable ethics.  

This is portion of the final email that was sent to FCA Customer Service after their representative informed me that the case was closed and then hung up on me.  BEWARE!!!!!!!  THERE ARE OTEHR OPTIONS.
______________________________
SENT TO FCA REPRESENTATIVE –
 
I do not appreciate your hanging up on me just now.  The pattern of your not having the ability to get facts straight continues to amaze me.  Your condescending and over arrogant attitude is shocking to me as your role in this matter is that of Customer Service. 

The fact that you have “Informed” me that you will be closing this case and have no continued interest in dealing with the body damage that occurred to this vehicle after it was dropped off with Autonation further amazes me.  This dealership has committed a fraudulent act and have obviously taken advantage of a Senior Citizen in order to receive financial gain.  The principle of this is utterly shocking.  Your inability to see through this is atrocious!",1.0
3,"March 14, 2020",Worst Dealer Experience! Recently Bought A Car 60k! And literally test drove the car maybe 2 miles. After purchasing it 5 min out the dealer one of my Radiators bust Towed it to the dealer I had to pay out of my pocket for no repairs because I declined and they did not even take it apart! I fix the car on my own just to it run rough. Now the car needs a engine and they dont want to perform the work because it's the oem coverage but oem will not take the car simply because has been modified! This is how I purchased the car from Autonation! I making one final move before I file a lawsuit for selling me a dam lemon of a car! Service department has been pushing around back and forth and won't honor there Platinum coverage. Seriously Garbage service,1.0
4,"February 03, 2020","We bought our car in 2016. The sales folks pretty much found us what we wanted. Then we had our first service issue where the transmission began making odd noises. We brought in our car and the transmission was fixed with no extra problems.Later, the transmission began actin odd again. This time the transmission had to be completely rebuilt.  Again, we got our car back again with no issued.

Some months passed by and we began to have trouble where the vehicle would randomly and intermittently cut off with out any warning from the vehicle that there were any issues with it. 

After several attempts to have the car fixed or the car never registered any type of diag code. Eventually we got a lead engineer from Dodge/Fiat. He said all he could do is offer a new us a new vehicle at 15% off MSRP. We chose to coninue to try to diagnose the real issue. After two bouts with their diagnosis tool we were never able to get the ECU to spit out a code of any type. We contacted the NHTSA and more but no one could do anything to advocate for us on our behalf. This was all after we still had both our manufacturer's warranty and an extended warranty for this vehicle.",1.4
5,"December 12, 2019","Chase and his entire service squad should be fired and find new jobs.  This location used to provide great service. Now, I wouldn't recommend them to my worst enemy. 

I brought my Jeep there a year ago to get a routine oil change. After picking up the vehicle, the computer started acting up and shut down the entire NAV and Uconnect system. They charged me an additional $169 just to run a diagnostic and reset the computer(which research online shows this can be down by simply unhooking the battery).

Fast forward 6 months, I take my Jeep in to get a smog test. A week afterwards, the nav and uconnect go out again. In all the years I've own my Jeep, the only times this has happened is immediately following their work. They tell me to bring it back in as a follow consultation so I wouldn't be charged again. I arrive, and someone else tells me they're too busy to see my vehicle and to make an appointment. I make an appointment and talk to a new guy named Jordan, who tells me I have to pay for ANOTHER diagnostic test of $169. I rightfully refuse, then he tells me I didn't have to pay the last time, and Jeep covered that. I call later and find out that he lied and I did pay, and STILL wanted to charge me a 2nd time.  Meanwhile THEY HAVNT LOOKED at my vehicle yet. It's  3pm, and they had me bring it in at 10am for my ""appointment"".  

Total scam of a location, run by incompetent people just trying to take your money. 

Never go here. You'll regret it.

***UPDATE***

After reading online I could fix my issue by simply unhooking and reconnecting the car battery, the issue is fixed.  NO THANKS to the service department at this Jeep dealership who tried to work me for $350 to do the same thing. The got away with the first $169, but not the 2nd. Beware of this shady service department. Read the other similar reviews. They're scary.",1.0
6,"August 15, 2019","We took our Jeep here for an AC issue, it was quoted over $2,000 to fix. We let them know we would need a second quote and we took the car back. They called the next day and offered a 10% discount if we brought it back, we said no we needed a second quote. They called the next day and asked if we would sell them the car, we said no thanks. Took it to another shop who did the work for $800. We still had to pay the $169 diagnostic fee which is very high. We won’t bring our Jeep here again. Do not go to this dealer for anything.",1.0
7,"April 27, 2019","Scammers. Called 5 dealerships in the Houston area to flash radio (430N) to recognize rearview camera.  Quoted $99 and he sounded like he knew what I was talking about. The best price for a five minute process. Three weeks later when I was able to get an appointment they quoted $170 and the service rep was confused on what was required (offered to show him the instructions on line on the proper VIN code to select/update -  Sales code ‘XAC’) Spoke to the service manager and while he ultimately provided a discount ($130), the bait and switch speaks to the integrity of the operation and an example of why dealer service centers have such a bad reputation.",1.0
8,"April 17, 2019","UPDATE: After receiving the notification below from the owner, I called the GM the next day. Obviously there is a disconnect between the owner and the GM or the owner is truly only worried about making a profit anyway he can. 
I call the GM and told him I was going to file a claim with insurance (even though I bought a damaged truck from AutoNation and they should have been responsible for the repairs) and said I would like to just get my truck back since they have had it as of March 5th. Therefore, I proposed that they pay the deductible which is much less of a financially burden to them than covering the whole cost.  He said, ""No."" I then had to twist his arms to get him to cover half of the deductible.
To company of that size a few thousand dollars is a drop in the bucket if it means repeat business and referrals. Now Autonation is making a profit off of me twice: 1) The sale of the damaged truck 2) The insurance claim to get the truck repaired to working order.
The GM had the audacity to call me today ask for me to remove my review since they are taking care of the problem. Seriously? 
At this point it is no longer about the money it's the principle of the matter. 



Had I read the reviews on google first prior to the purchase of the used F250, I would not have bought the truck from AutoNation. It appears to be a reoccurring problem where people buy used vehicles from there and inherent problems, then are told they have the 90 day warranty that is completely useless. BUYERS BEWARE - DO NOT BUY USED FROM HERE. They will not help you, Service Manager GM, etc. are more worried about hitting their bonuses than having returning customers. 

I bought a used F250 from them on Saturday, on Tuesday a service light came on. I didn't even have the truck a full 3 days.  AutoNation Dodge sent the truck to AutoNation Ford to figure out the problem. Turns out either the previous owner or whoever AutoNation bought the truck from put ""something"" in the def tank. They have had my truck since April 5th and have been fighting on who was going to pay the $~4,000 to correct it, or place the blame on me. Knowing that I did nothing to contaminate the DEF system and understanding the way the system works I have presented my case to several of their management up to the GM. Today he told me that the repairs would not be covered by Autonation. I was told that in order to get the truck put back together it would be $680... just to leave. This is totally unacceptable. You buy a car from a reputable company and then get screwed because they didn't do their due diligence with their ""Certified"" vehicle.",1.0
9,"April 17, 2019","One of the worst experiences I had dealing with this place. I walked in knowing exactly what I want after doing my research online. I was told incorrect information, the numbers kept changing at least 5 or 6 different times, and the sales manager outright lied on several points. After spending 4 hours there I left without buying the car I wanted. I returned home to find 4 different credit checks ran on my credit report, while I was assured that only one hard inquiry was done on my report. Autonation should not have such wrong financial policies, and Carlos Parades the sales manager should not be in such a position. This dealership is a bad representative of Chrysler.
I later got an email from the GM, Cecilio Flores, asking about my bad experience. I responded with the details and he never even bothered to respond. More time lost with this dealership.",1.0
10,"March 06, 2019","I have a brand new car - I also have a service and tire warranty program where oil changes and tire service is covered. I took it in for a routine oil change and tire rotation. I made the appt. online with a rep. via chat. I get there at 7:20AM - appt is 7:30 . They tell me I'm there to get an alignment, service mechanical issues,  tires, fluid flush, brake check, etc. I said, ""No.. I am here for an oil change and rotation. I drive a brand new car, I do not need any of that stuff""... He says ok takes me inside, shows me a piece of paper of the 'recommended' services. I said, ""Again, I drive a BRAND NEW CAR I do not need an alignment, fluid flush, none of that. It is brand new. Just an oil change."" He proceeds to tell me I need new tires and they probably wont rotate them because of it. ITS A BRAND NEW CAR! I tell him ""that is insane... I literally bought this car with 15 miles on it."" I ask for a shuttle to take me home... at 7:30AM.  8:40AM Still no shuttle. I walk back over to ask what the deal is, he says ""Oh, it comes at 9:00AM"" I got there before 7:30! No one told me I would be sitting there till 9! I would have called an Uber the second I checked in with them. THEN I go to pickup my car after work, they write up a service plan. They say I need a new battery.. IN A BRAND NEW CAR... for.. drumroll... $551! On a Dodge Durango! I was speechless. LOL $551 for a battery... on a brand new car... This was the most ridiculous experience I've had. these guys are thirsty for work. Ill go to a different location from now on.",1.4

Andrew -the employee who took the call- told her that there was no need for an appointment but that I was going to take an hour. No problem, I took my wife's Cherokee there. I waited 5 minutes outside for somebody to come and get my car, no luck. Then, I went inside and there were at least 10 employees talking to each other, some of them doing nothing and NOBODY asked me what I needed. I stood there for another 5 minutes. Finally Bukeka Carter was the only one who asked me if I needed any help. Although she hadn't had lunch yet she took care of me with a smile in her face. The rest of the employees continued to chat.

14,"August 07, 2018","Tried to buy a car with pre-arranged price and financing.  Salesperson after 2 and a half hours was so concerned with new folks coming in, he failed to even start the paperwork with me.  I sat in a cramped office for 2+ hours and did not even start the paperwork, even though vehicle, price and financing had already been determined.  Got up to go the bathroom and came back and office was now occupied by another salesperson and customer.  Was told to find another office.  The short time my sales person was in the office, was interrupted by guys sheetrock repair of walls, F&I person, etc.  I left with no resolution and no help from management.  Terrible, terrible, terrible.  I have examples of unbelievable terrible service as well where we dropped a vehicle off for factory recall and they stated it would be ready that evening as they had the parts in stock.  4 days later we were able to pick up the vehicle.

16,"May 16, 2018","I called and inquired of a Dodge Challenger I was interested in purchasing. My wife and I came in and test drove the vehicle. After this was when things went south. I showed the listing I found on CarGurus advertising the price of $28,294. I did some math and gave an offer I felt was extremely fair (~100 dollars off the drive out price). 

The manager (Todd) comes in to discuss the deal. The offer he laid out listed the price at $30,544 (before TTL). I told him this was not the price I saw on CarGurus. He retorts that he does not advertise on Cargurus and car gurus lists cars from their inventory just to bloat their inventory advertised. Okay. I was in front of him and pulled up the AutoNation Dodge website and see the exact car listed at $28,294. His response? ""Oh that's the purchase price, not the lease price. If you did your homework you would obviously know."" Okay, if that's the case, why not say that from the beginning? That the price of $28,294 was for financing and not leasing. His lack of manners, condescending attitude stemmed from how little he knew and how much he underestimated me. It would've saved 10 minutes of conversation had he explained that in the beginning. Instead, he goes on to brag about how he as a sales manager moves 500 cars a month 

Long story short, they lost a deal. Misleading on the price of the vehicle, getting aggressive and argumentative when that was unnecessary, and last, because the sales managers arrogance and snarky behavior as disgusting as it was, could not overshadow how sleazy he was and how sleazy he runs this dealership. What a joke.

Update: Upon further investigation; AutoNation Dodge Jeep Ram Katy owns and responds to reviews on their CarGurus profile; meaning they advertise on CarGurus. Another lie. Good to know.",1.0

18,"April 28, 2018","Took my new truck to have my oil changed.  When I got home I noticed that the rear wheel had the center cap missing.  Went to the dealership the next day and told them that evidently they forgot to replace the cap.  They had someone go to check and he came back with a cap, but it wasn’t it.  To make the story short they said they would order one and would call me when it got in, which they never did.  I went back to the dealership and once again I was told that they had called and they returned it because I never picked it up.  They promise to order it again and call when it came in.  I called the technician and got his voice mail and left a message inquiring about the status of the wheel cap.  Never had the call returned, it’s being about a month and I’m sure they’ll never call me.  I will never go back to this dealership and will be contacting Dodge with my concerns.  If you have any problems with service you should contact Dodge with your complaints.  ",1.8
19,"March 09, 2018","I’m sorry to say that I bought my vehicle at this dealership.

I scheduled my most recent appointment with service on Saturday. It takes about 30 minutes to get to the dealership. Normal service time for my issue would be 1-4 hours total worst-case, so  I intended to wait for my vehicle. When I arrived the service man told me that it would be until at least Tuesday before he could get to my vehicle. When I inquired as to why he didn’t call me in advance to notify me so that I wouldn’t waste my time traveling to the dealership he blew me off and seem totally unconcerned.  He backpedaled and said he could try to “work me in” but no promises.  I reminded him that I thought the intent of the appointment was to avoid the very thing that was happening.

This is not the first incident I have had with this dealership.  I will totally avoid this dealership in the future.

26,"August 15, 2017","I took my 2012 T&C in to find out why the brakes were pulsing.  They replaced the rotors in august 2016 after 106,000 miles (never turned with 2 brake pad replacements) and the brake pads 2 months ago. 
I also wanted them to re-mount the rear drivers side blind spot sensor that had dropped off.  It's taped on the inside of the lower rear quarter panel.
They told me my almost new rotors in the front were warped and needed to be turned.  
So they wanted to replace the front rotors at 124,000 miles and replace the Master Cylinder and Power Booster for $706.00.  They also told me that it would cost $500.00 to re-mount the sensor because they had to remove the entire rear bumper assembly to get access to where the sensor had to be re-mounted.
I refused and took the van to another shop.  They told me all 4 rotors were warped so I had them turn them for $300.00 including an oil change and car wash.  They didn't see any problems with the Power Booster or the Master Cylinder.  I found a Youtube video on how to remove 3 screws and pull the lower part of the bumper out to expose the location of the sensor.  So, $6.00 worth of double sided water proof tape and 20 minutes I got the sensor re-mounted.

28,"April 12, 2017","I dropped off my truck there with an airbag light last week, April 6, 2017, that would stay on. I just had my Dodge Ram Serviced two months prior here at AutoNation Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram Katy with a recall on the airbag system which they did fix free of charge due to the recall. I dealt with a Jesus who was really rude and acted like he could care less about my truck and situation, very poor customer service here. After they inspected my truck and after i paid $104 for them to do the diagnostics, they told me that the air bag light was on due to a bad connection somewhere in the Truck. Bottom line, they would not cover the charge to fix the light, even after they had just serviced the air bag issue 2 months prior, seems like it was all related in my opinion, nevertheless they wanted to charge me an additional $300 to fix the issue. Ram Care also flat out refused to fix the simple issue, that is another poor review coming up on their end. Dodge should cover all air bag issues by the 100 mile warranty but they don't. So i declined for them to fix it and took my truck to my local mechanic and all he had to do was reset the air bag light at not cost, the dealership want to charge me $400 just to reset the light which only took my mechanic 2 minutes to do, wow what a rip off AutoNation Ram Katy is. All they had to do was reset the light, which to me wasn't done when the serviced it 2 months ago because the light came on right after that service. Heck i even sent an email to the general manager Roy Roach and never got a reply. Never again will i take my truck there or refer anyone there, they will rip you off.

30,"February 02, 2017","Unfortunately, there is no way to give ""negative"" stars. If possible, I would.

First, I found a price for a vehicle on the website that I really wanted. Called and talked with Eric, and told him I would come out in the evening to look at it. The vehicle was listed as ""brand new"". Once I arrived and met with Eric, he said that the vehicle was not here, that a manager had taken it home for the day. Even though it was not here (per Eric at that time), since I knew that was the one I wanted, I told him no need to take a test drive, just show me another vehicle on the lot that has the same features to look into. At that point, I wanted him to start running the numbers to get financing in process, as I didn't want to be there all night.
Miraculously, the vehicle was found, but the pricing was given and it was higher than the advertised price on the internet. Why post a sale price and not honor it? Well, it is because it has been ""sold"" to the service department to be used there, and then ""sold"" back to sales to sell me. The rebates that would come with a new model do not apply, since it is NOT technically a new vehicle.

After going back and forth, a deal was made and I drove out of the dealership with my dream vehicle. For (2) weeks exactly, I drove around and showed all of my friends and family about all of the cool features that this truck has.

Then, (14) days after making the purchase and signing the contract, I was called and asked to come into the dealership to discuss some paperwork. It was then told to me that after all, the bank that I signed the contract with decided that they are not going to honor it. I had to either give it back and drive home in my previous vehicle that I traded in, or sign a NEW contract with a massive increase on interest rate. YOU ARE READING THIS RIGHT. THE CONTRACT I SIGNED WAS NOT BEING HONORED BY THE FINANCE COMPANY AND DEALERSHIP AFTER (14) DAYS. Nothing changed in my credit, and nothing was shown to be inaccurate in my application. I have NEVER had a legal document that I signed given back to me and told that the SELLER is not going to honor it. If I just showed up after 2 weeks and said I do not like the terms and want to change it, they would laugh me out the door. I had to either surrender the vehicle IMMEDIATELY or pay MORE money.

I never thought signing a legally binding contract can just be denied, after 2 weeks, with no lies or wrong information listed.

The only recourse will be to let as many people as I can all over the world know that in Texas, a vehicle contract with AutoNation means NOTHING. There are NO words to describe the feeling that a contract means nothing. There is NO language in the contract stating that it is waiting for approval, but this dealership makes deals, signs contracts between customers and finance companies, without getting approvals. I thought problems like this might come from a used car dealership that could be shady, but not the dealer on a NEW vehicle. I have been lied to at every point of the process of buying a NEW vehicle. Wrong price listed, NOT new as stated, contract cancelled after (2) weeks, and either sign a NEW contract with higher terms, or take back your previously paid off trade in and act like the last (2) weeks never happened.

UPDATE: After contacting the general manager of the facility, they changed my contract again back to the original contract. I do not know how this happened in the first place, but the general manager, Nick, was beyond helpful and fixed the issue. I am confident that the financing individuals did what they did to me without his knowledge.

At the end of the day, my issued were resolved. Unfortunately, this should have never happened the way it did. Hopefully, they have taken the steps necessary to make sure moving forward this does not happen again to anyone else.",2.0
31,"January 05, 2017","But just wait until your Dodge breaks down. It will. Trust me. I've posted on other social media sites so I'll keep this brief. I have a manufacturer's warranty AND an extended warranty on my 2012 Dodge Durango. It keeps stalling but it won't show a diag code. Since there's no code Dodge corporate and AutoNation either flat our refuse to fix my car or give me the run around. Luckily, my wife fought hard enough with corporate to convince AutoNation to bring my car back in AND give us a rental. However, now we have no idea what service will be performed on our car, who will look at it (hopefully not the knuckleheads who've already looked at it once), and when we will get it back. I refuse to accept it back without verification of someone higher up the food chain looking at it and serial #'s for new Mopar parts that have been used in repairing the vehicle. Do NOT buy a Dodge. It WILL catch up with you.",1.2

33,"November 17, 2016","Went to Katy dodge looking for either a challenger or a charger sat down after making my mind up on the srt8 challenger I wanted to add rims and tires we agree on the price then when I get to the business office to sign the paperwork the $55,237.54 agreed price all changed to $74,690.00 if I didn't look at the paperwork I would have been screwed.  The sales manager came out to my car after I walked out and said the salesman was suppose to tell me they made a mistake and gave me the price for an r/t not the srt8 hellcat.  So I go back inside to see what deal can be made $74,000 is the best they can do.  So I leave same day I bought a 2016 srt8 challenger from a competitor for $52,000 cash price with added 22 inch staggered rims and tires and also subwoofers and amps all for $52k but Katy dodge was almost $20k more really and the 2017 are almost here.  Will never in life go here again not even they are the very last new car dealership on earth I will just never buy a new car again.  STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOT THEY ARE LIARS AND CHEATING SCAM ARTIST.

35,"August 16, 2016","If I could give them 0 stars, I would. Went in for a TIPM issue $1300 repair on my Chrysler that is recalled on other vehicles. It took over 10 days of my vehicle sitting there, with lies stacked upon lies from the manager Jackie, to hear back that nothing would be covered. It wasn't the fact that they didn't cover it, we knew they may not, it was the lying to my face by Jackie about contacting the district manager. What an awful experience. And if it really does take 10 days to get in contact with the district manager, then something has got to change. No sense of urgency around here. And for the update of now that we sent our TIPM to be inspected and fixed by an electrical engineer, it is the exact recalled issue that this dealership refused not to cover. Chrysler recalls asked them to approve it, but they refused.",1.0
36,"August 01, 2016","We actually went to this dealership twice. The first time, they were looking for the car we came to see, but could not find it. After 20 minutes of sitting and waiting, they told us they were still looking. Thirty minutes later, there was no follow up. We left, decided to look at the Autonation Ford down the street (an even more horrible experience they will take away dealer incentives if you have a high value trade) and then came back 2 hours later. 

When we returned we actually got a salesperson, who also couldnt find the car we wanted so we test drove a higher end model of the Grand Cherokee we wanted. Our salesperson then became ill and had to leave, and we were shuttled to someone else. We expressed interest in either of the GC's we came to see an wanted a follow up with a menu of options for finance the next day. We received no contact.

I then called the salesperson Delores, who was on her day off, and she called someone and had a finance menu sent to us. Dodge valued my trade more fairly than Ford, but wouldnt negotiate further on price even if I was also willing to put 20% down. 

At that point, there was no more follow up. No more efforts to sell me a car other than the auto emails I receive. 

I now am the proud owner of a 2015 Edge I bought at Randall Reed's Planet Texas. When you negotiate the sale, you usually will wind up with a buyer. 

Too bad Autonation doesnt negotiate.

37,"July 26, 2016","Initially they are very friendly. I told them that the lights in my car sometimes turn off, and then back on which it is very dangerous at night or early morning. Since my car was going to be checked, I also mentioned that the passenger's window was not closing properly, and that the heater was not working right either. They took a day to have my car checked, and got a call from the assistant manager who took my information the next day. He said that they had not found anything wrong with the lights but that they did check the other issues, using a not nice tone of voice, wen I said that my main issue was not being solved. He insisted they did not find anything wrong and that it would not have been fair to me for them to lie and say that there was indeed a problem! So he said that I would have to pay around 2,200 dollars to fix the other issues. I told him that my main concern was the issue with the lights, and I even asked if they had driven the car, he said no, but he was sort of argumentative,  and I had to  make him aware about it. He insisted that they did not find anything, so they could do nothing because it was like looking for a needle in a haystack. I had then the option to either pay them 90.00 for just checking my car, and leave that site with no solutions at all, but with 90.00 less in my pocket!  Pay them 2,200 to partially fix the issues, or pay any of the two, and still leaving that place with no solution to my main issue. So, what kind of place is this one where they give such a bad treatment to a customer, and where in the end what matters is what they can get out of your pockets, argue with you making you feel like you are crazy expecting them to figure out what is going on with your car, you don't know what you are talking about, etc. So, just go there and pay them something for an easy issue,  get an attitude from the assistant service manager, and leave with your problems half way solved. It all seems that that is all they care about. Very disappointing. ",1.0
38,"July 22, 2016","I have tried to use this dealership for service several times since I live very close, however I always get burned. I have a commercial Ram cargo van I use for business, when I was on my last visit, they kept my van for a week and a half and did not replace the headlight, fog lamp, brake light fluid indicator,front sway bar,rear squeaky leaf spring bushing. None of the requested items were fixed, I just got an oil change. I was so busy I picked up keys drove home and noticed nothing was done! When I called back they apologized, and said I should schedule another week for them to do all the work needed. This place has a very bad culture, a , what's in it for me attitude, I don't like working here so I'm going to rip off as many people as I can, attitude , a nobody cares , everybody is shady attitude that seems to infect most of the group.

40,"June 05, 2016","Today June 4th, I went to test drive a Dodge Durango, liked the car. The negotiations required the standard walk out which they allowed me to do for the second time test driving the vehicle. At this point, I just planned to purchase a different vehicle. The snake of a Sales Manager, Nickalus Coray called me to say the purchase price was now agreeable. I actually kept the voicemail, I called him back said I would be on my way. When I got there the car had been magically sold due to a ""miscommunication"". Nickalus, wasn't anywhere to be found and they claimed if I just wrote them the check they would find me one that was the same. I looked at these ""same cars"" and saw differences. At this point, I got up told the sales guy sorry his sales manager screwed him out of a sale. Bottom line, there are probably some good people that work there but overall bad business practices. Not honest, and didn't follow through with there promises. I will always tell everyone to avoid that place like the plague!",1.0
41,"May 18, 2016","Went into dealership late on a Saturday evening to look at used car. Liked the car but couldn't agree on a price. After going back and forth with the ""manager"" in the secret room for an hour and a half the manager, Marco, offered me his final deal. We were still $1,000 apart (I had a trade).  I told him that i would like to think about it and i would be back Monday morning. Monday morning i go back to the dealership and tell them i will take the offer. ""What offer?""  They backed out on the offer they had made. I was livid. I went to Texas Direct who gave me more than the extra thousand for my car and purchased the vehicle from the dealer. Believe me if it had not been a haerd to find car i would have run from this deal. 

Fast forward two weeks and the service engine light comes on indicating the need for an oil change.  Get the oil changed ($100) and then happen to think what did I pay dealer prep for. I go to Autonation Dodge and talk to Marco and ask if the dealer prep includes oil change. Answer ""yes"". So i ask why i just had to get mine changed after 100 miles. ""They probably just forgot to reset it"". What difference does that make to me. How am i supposed to know that?  So i ask for $100. ""Let me check with my dorector....  No we cant do that"". That's okay, can you just give me $100 credit in your service department for my next oil change?  Director again, we just changed ownership and we cant do that.  It is clearly this sort of inconsiderate money grubbing that i will not do business at this dealership again. Why is $100 so important to them and irrelevant to me. ",1.4
42,"April 21, 2015","I took my vehicle in because there was a recall on the alternator and because check engine light was on. When I picked up my vehicle the windows were completely fogged up from the inside. I realized later that this was because the entire floor boards of vehicle were wet, soak and wet. There were also 40 miles unaccounted for. I believe someone at the dealership drove my vehicle without permission and drove through some water. No one is taking the blame. They said they ran all kinds of tests and found no leaks. If they did what I believe they did, they wouldn't have found any leaks. I'm afraid I'll have a problem trading my car in when that time comes. I will never take my car back to this dealership or purchase from them again. ",1.0
43,"February 26, 2015","It took two days to get an appointment to have my vehicle serviced, This is not the first time,
I have two vehicles I take to this dealership, and It takes anywhere from 2-5 days to get your car back.  I called on Monday to get an appointment on Wednesday 2/25, They needed my vehicle by 8;00 am, I had to get a ride to drop the vehicle off during rush hour.  Steve Gregor took my car in at 8;00 am and said he would call as soon as my car was finished up.  I needed;  OIL CHANGE/WINDSCHIELD WIPERS/FREON IN MY AC/MY HEADLAMP CHECKED.  I did not hear back from Steve all day, at 5;30 pm I called to see if my vehicle was ready, he came back with, The mechanics were not finished up yet, but should be soon, and he would call me as soon as its ready. At 6:30 (Service closes at 7:00) I had to call back because I knew they were closing soon.  Mike answered my call, and said Steve was gone for the day, and Jackie the service manager was gone for the day, and he did not know when my truck would be done!!?? it would not be until tomorrow!..I said..HOW WOULD I GET TO WORK? IT WAS NOW TOO LATE TO CALL FOR A RENTAL CAR!.. I had to ask him to find out if my truck could be picked up tonight...he came back to me at 6:45 and said if I could make it by 7:00 he would be there I could pick it up.  SO IN 10 1/2 HOURS IN THE SHOP THE ONLY THING THAT WAS DONE WAS AN OIL CHANGE AND WINDSCHIELD WIPERS REPLACED.  THEY COULD NOT REPLACE THE FREON IN THE AC/OR LOOK AT MY HEADLAMP.  BTW This is the second time I have taken the time to bring the truck to them for the freon replacement, and the mechanics just never got to it!

44,"June 06, 2012","Beware!!! Very unorganized operation when dealing with Customer Service/Sales/Finance. I do not recommend this dealership because of there ""integrity issues"" within ""Allen-Samuels-Dodge-Chry-Jeep-Katy"" staff/employees, who mislead/falsehood of an Active Duty Military customer. Of my personal opinion, the trust of this dealership is in question? In which, it may indicate ""a lack of integrity"" to all it's customers!!! This was my first-time experience to which I will like to share...

Remarks: During my ""Purchase Agreement"" of Jeep Commander 2008: I had experience an ""Breach of Contract"" from (""Allen-Samuel-Dodge-Katy"", 21777 Katy Freeway Katy, TX) 

The contract agreement was of: ""We Owe back"" to customer for the buyers contract...neverthless, the dealership was paid in full amount of the total ""Bill of Sale"", as promised by customer and by a ""cleared bank check"" for the purchase of the vehicle. 

However, I was promised by ""Allen-Samuels-Dodge-Chry-Jeep-Katy""  that an ""OVERNIGHT check of $1322.00"" for the jeep accessories to which was incorporated within the ""Bill of Sale""/apart of my military loan, would be refunded back to me, since the dealership was not able to provide that service.

Although, I called several times and sent electronic emails and yet...after 30-days of purchase, I was verbally promised again from the ""Dealership Accounting, Finance, Sales offices"" that an ""OVERNIGHT check"" had/would been mailed to me. I was not provided any mailing tracking number?  

As of today, I still have not received any ""WE Owe back"" to customer of the OVERNIGHT check for $1322.00, as promised???  

In conclusion, of my personal opinion, the trust of this dealership is in question? In which, it may indicate ""a lack of integrity"" to all it's customers!!! The reflections of my first-time experience may happen to you and so, if you have a choice, choose another option.
