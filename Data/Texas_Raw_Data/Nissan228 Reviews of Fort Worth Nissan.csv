6,"November 12, 2019","This past weekend we were on the hunt for a new or even used van. After visiting several different dealerships throughout the day, this was our last stop. From the moment we arrived we were greeted with friendly and sympathetic smiles and warm personalities. Our salesman Chris Guillory was wonderfully pleasant to work with as well as very informative on the NV 3500 passenger van. As with any process questions and concerns would come up in our conversation and he as well as the dealership manager Al was there to answer them immediately. Then in addition their wonderful service, we were expecting a lengthy time to sign paperwork and once again we were surprised on how fast and easy the entire process was as a whole. We headed back to our hotel feeling wonderful about the entire process and knew we made the right decision on our purchase. If you are looking for wonderful and friendly service, Nissan of Fort Worth is an exceptional choice. ",5.0
7,"October 21, 2019","I'm so pleased with my new vehicle purchase. I had a wild hair to trade in my vehicle and upgrade to something larger. Chris made my experience positive, easy, and not stressful. His communication was fantastic and he understood my budget and needs. If one idea didn't work out, he had a new idea ready, Absolutely great experience. Pete Ballard was also fantastic to get me into my new vehicle. Kudos to these gentleman for dealing with me and my five year old daughter! =)",5.0

10,"May 14, 2019","Great dealership buy a car from. Atmosphere was non-threatening no pressure everything was smooth.
Chris was our salesman, he was a 10 very knowable and  Friendly. Ask for him! 

The new ""start my purchase"" online is awesome. You can do everything from getting the price of the car getting your trade in value and financing before you even go into the dealership.

There are no games on the trade-in allowance with the black books that is what they gave me. I would recommend this place to anyone that wants to buy a Nissan.",5.0
11,"April 17, 2019","On the 3rd of April, I attempted to purchase a Nissan Altima 2019, we spoke with George the Fleet Manager and Micheala the financial Adviser. We went through the whole process of negotiating and came to an agreement. We put a trade in Jeep of a value of $9,000 something along with $2,000 down. We sat down with the financial adviser, which is the normal step when everything is said and done. We signed all the contract and agreements. We were told they would contact us the next day to give us our copies of the contract. We never heard back from the Fort Worth Nissan off of 3451 W Loop 820 S Forth Worth, TX 76116. There were a few issues with the car I purchased, such as the sun roof was not working right, the right side wheel frames were bent in, and the back speakers were crackling. I contracted George the Fleet manager about these issues and he told me to take it to service and ask for Ryan, which he would help me and get me straight. Not once did George mention there was an issue with our contract. So naturally I didn’t worry. A week after having the car on 10 April 2019, I took the car to get service while my brother went to the financial adviser to get copies of our contract. The manager of the dealership sat us down and told us that the contract was not accepted anymore and in order to keep the car, we would need to put down another $5,400 dollars. This was unacceptable, we had already come to an agreement and we already had a bank that approved our loan. The manager didn’t know what to say other than, the financial adviser was not the final step. When we spoke with the Financial Adviser, she even thought we were done and didn’t understand what the manager was talking about. The manager in our opinion dropped the ball somewhere. We were never notified of any issues or that the bank came back and denied us. The manager claimed that George the Fleet manager should of told us, which he did not. They have also lost our paper work as well as the power of attorney we gave them for the trade in. So if we would have never gone in for service, we would never had been told there was an issue with the contract. Then what? If I would never gone in, would they have contracted us? This is unacceptable. I have been to many dealership where the financial adviser was the last step in the process of buying a car. The Nissan in Fort Worth really needs to learn how the system works. They took time away from us and plain out drop the ball. I don’t know what they were doing but they messed up somewhere and we paid for it. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I have purchased a lot of cars in my day and every time we go to the financial adviser, which has ALWAYS been the last step. That is where we all came to agreement and we sign on the dotted lines. I have contacted the Better Business Bureau as well as put my reviews for the Nissan in Fort Worth. They took my time and my money and I came out empty handed. This is not how you run business and I feel you need to retrain that manager and team on how the process works, because apparently they don’t know how it works or the steps they need to take to finish a contract. I love Nissan, but this was the worst sale I have ever been in and it makes me doubt Nissan. I have owned a Nissan before and I was trying to own another one, but with this kind of personnel, I don’t know if I want to do business with Nissan if they don’t know how to work the process. I am not happy with how things turned out! Very disappointed!!",1.8

15,"March 31, 2019","I went in as a first time buyer at 23 years old. As soon as I walked in i was welcomed and greeted with energy and respect. I went in worked with Chris Guillory and WOW is an understatement! He was so professional, ongoing and was extremely patient! Did not ay any point try to force a car on me, he was open to all my options and never made a face or stuck with one car. He showed me all the possibilities and we went from there! He worked with me as best as possible and didn’t treat me like a “young buyer” I went to a different dealership (not Nissan) and they didn’t expect for me to leave with anything! Chris and most of the staff were super welcoming! Would definitely buy from him and Nissan Fort Worth again. ",5.0

17,"March 28, 2019",I was in the market for a car for over a year.  My dealer Devan was very informative and pleasant and a pleasure to work with.

24,"February 18, 2019","I had already decided I wanted a 2019 Nissan Pathfinder Platinum but was having trouble finding the color combination I wanted.  Talked to Travis by phone and 10 minutes later he called me back and told me he had located the car I wanted.  Chris picked it up that evening from a Dallas dealership and had it for me the next morning  Chris did an outstanding job of showing us all of the vehicle features and answered all of our questions.  As an added surprise, they delivered the car with a full tank of gas.",4.8

26,"February 07, 2019","This is our third vehicle with this dealership.  We bought a used 2010 Nissan Rogues six years ago, leased a 2016 Nissan Rogue three years ago and now just recently leased a 2019 Nissan Pathfinder.  Each visit we were treated with much respect and no pressure.  This last purchase we worked with Mr. Chris Guillory.  Chris reached out to us due to our previous lease getting ready to come due.  I advised Chris of what I was thinking about doing and what I wanted to do and he was very helpful.  This conversation took place through text messaging.  Chris responded to all questions quickly and was able to accommodate the time we could come speak with him due to my work hours (which was close to his closing time).  When we got to the dealership, Chris essentially had a plan in place to speed up the process.  He already had the Pathfinder picked out for us to drive and was very patient with us (especially since we had our 6 year old son).  Not once did I feel pressured to make a decision or hurried.  He had us taken care of in record time which we really appreciated.  Chris really listened to what I was wanting to do and he did his absolute best to put us in the right situation, and for that I am grateful.   The last lease purchase in 2016 were very much easy and enjoyable experiences as well and I definitely give Mr. Ron Parish the same kudos back then.    ",4.8
27,"February 04, 2019",Chris was awesome going the extra mile to get us into an Armada after leasing our Rogue.  He has gone above and beyond to make it happen and has been quick to respond on any questions or concerns we’ve had!  He was a pleasure to work with and look forward to working with him again in the future!,4.2
28,"January 23, 2019","This is my second Nissan from this dealership.  Whether on the sales floor, talking to receptionists, calling for service info, or receiving maintenance, everyone has been congenial, quick to respond, and always made me feel welcome and at home.  My 2016 Nissan Altima was totaled by a deer in October of 2018.  I had met Chris Guillory a few months earlier.  When I called, he got right on searching for just the right car.  The day I actually went to look at models, he was right there through the whole process.  Even though other Nissan dealers were authorized by my credit union, I chose to stick with MY dealership.  Chris has taken the initiative to see that MY dealership is approved with my credit union, so the next car I purchase through him will be hassle-free.  I'm a Nissan owner and Fort Worth Nissan customer for life!",5.0

I bought a 2015 Qx60 on the beginning of December, 2018 first week i called them up an explained to them that their was a leak in my car, the person who i was in contact was David the sales rep. and stated that i will have to take my car back to get it checked out. I take it back to them they kept it for a few days then couple days later they stated their was nothing wrong with my car. I took it to my own mechanic and his own son whose 20 yr old stated that the problem was the transfer case is leaking and the motor mounds are bad please see attached pictures. I called the dealer and he stated that the will call infiti because this damages were still under warranty. I contacted the manager and he stated that their was nothing he could do for me, me as a customer if i just bought a car i do not have to be going through this because as i know it should've been inspected in the first place i will not have to be going out of my way to get all of this done by infiniti warranty instead of it being all done by the actual dealer ship i bought it from. Also i had to change the breaks on my own which is money out of my pocket now my question how in the xxxx did my car pass the inspection with bad breaks?. Please do not buy a car from they are not trust worthy even though the owner himself who is Chris Anderson claims he is in his homepage under integrity (see attached picture). Save your time and money and go somewhere else.  In the end im going to be making payments for a car i keep taking to get fixed. save your money and go somewhere e

56,"October 07, 2018","From the first phone call I placed to Fort Worth Nissan, and until I drove out of the parking lot, Chris Guillory exhibited the behaviors and attitudes, which I describe in my soon to be released book as “World Class Customer Service” He is Professional, Courteous, Attentive and Genuinely Interested in making sure that my wife and I had the best sales experience possible. Instead of dumping “features and benefits” on us, he acted as a trusted advisor, which is truly a representation  of the aforementioned assets, which he possesses as a Human Being. Not once did we feel pressured to make a decision. Instead, he was present as a guide. If Chris Guillory is indicative of your sales force as a whole, you should consider yourself Blessed. If not, I suggest that you clone him! I also want to give a personal thank you to Thad, the sales manager, who was equally impressive!  The differences between Your Team and an unmentioned pair, from the previous weekend, at “another” dealership, is Night and Day. I walked out of their dealership; I drove out of yours!

77,"August 25, 2018","If there was a place to give 0 or negative stars to them I would do that.

Don't go to this dealership if you have any self respect. Their idea is to fool customers and mint money from them. They agreed on a price and features on a particular car(promised me that all features we discuss are installed ion that car and shared the VIN number with me), they said the car was not in their lot and they will get it from other lots if I put a deposit. I put the deposit and they called me next day to say car is available and I should come to pick up. When I reached teh dealership and they showed me the car I realized it was missing some key features/accessories that we talked and they specifically assured me for.

The Manager came as said those features are in a different car which will cost $550 more, when I said that this was not the agreement he started shouting""DO YOU WANT TO BUY THE CAR, SHUT UP AND LISTEN WHAT I AM SAYING"", I told him that he needs to treat his customers with respect and this is not the way to talk. then he got up and threw the paper towards me and shouted""OK LETS NOT DO THIS DEAL"" and walked away.

I explained I had no funds and didn’t want to waist his time (about a million times). He met my not so positive attitude with a smile and assured me he wanted to hear me out. After running my credit, surely I thought, okay he’s going to walk away from this situation.

We went to Fort Worth Nissan looking for a new vehicle. We looked at 3 vehicles and test drove 2. The Frontier we test drove didn’t have the right “trim” package so we went inside to discuss the one we would like. We went outside to look around while the salesperson went to “bring” it around. He calls us in and says I want you to talk to the finance person. We both said we don’t want to talk to the finance person, we haven’t even test driven the truck. He said you did - it has the same engine. Anyway we sat down and she pulls out a paper with the “price” of the truck which includes a $2500 “dealer package” that they put on all their vehicles that can’t be taken off. We told her “he may as well not go get that vehicle because we are not paying X amount of dollars. She asked what it would take to get us out the door with that vehicle. We said you can start by taking X amount of dollars off. She wrote down the amount and we said “well that will at least get us to test drive it.” Off she goes and at the same time the salesperson pulls around with the vehicle. It was a good looking Frontier!! All excited we walked out and he gets out and says “oh you can’t test drive it. It doesn’t have any gas and the dealership has run out.”  What!?!?!?!? (We all know he could get some gas somewhere, we could see a gas station on the corner) So, we tell him we are going to go to lunch and discuss it. He states “oh let me go tell the finance person.” As we were walking out he runs up and states “you can’t get that car for X dollars” We said “What do you mean? That is what she wrote down.” He said you can’t have it for that. So we asked “then what was the whole thing with the paper?” He states “WE WERE TESTING YOUR COMMITMENT” What??? Well, we ended up buying a fully loaded Nissan Murano at a different dealership! Yes, we spent more than we had wanted to but it’s funny what a test drive will do for someone. We fell in love with it and had to have it. There is our commitment Fort Worth Nissan and the fact we are committed to never walking into your dealership ever!!

We say okay can y’all go get it while we get the paperwork going?

After 5 hours (literally I left at 11:00pm) I signed a contract paid the down payment and drove off. They refused to give me a copy of my contract. (This should have been a red light for me) The next while at work I get a phone call from finance manager telling me I was approved but it needed to be in a lesser cost vehicle. To go online and find something and when I get off we can finalize the deal. About 2 hours later I get a call from the original salesman advising this was not the case and that I needed to bring the car back asap. I arrived and was told they would TRY their best to get me approval and in the meantime i could 'borrow' a car from them and they would let me know asap once i received approval. TWO weeks later I get a call advising that after numerous hits on my credit, they were unable to obtain approval for me. The icing on the cake was that I was pulled over in the 'borrowed' car and was advised the car i was driving was a '2013 Nissan Altima' the plates they put on the car were not only expired but for a 2016 Nissan Rouge. Thankfully the police officer believed me that I was in a borrowed car from the dealership and didnt arrest me for fraudulent plates. I called the dealership where i was reassured that it was a simple mistake and they would email a new set of plates. The next day the finance manager called and demanded the car back and gave me a refund for my $800 down payment. The service there was ridiculous and I have never been treated so horribly in my life. I nearly had a mild heart attack at the thought of going to jail for fraud because of this dealership. ",1.0
141,"November 24, 2017","I had a good deal approved on a 2017 Nissan Rogue Sport for $17,300.00 + TTL.  The vehicle was to be titled in Alaska so there would be no local TT&L.  Kelley gave me the deal on-line.  She offered $100.00 less than I offered her.  Robert was assigned the deal and we agreed on the price, car, and logistics of my friend in Alaska getting his finance through the local Credit Union. I went into the dealership (drove from Arlington) to make sure we had a deal.  The shook and agreed.   When they contacted my Friend (on the phone)  they went up by $599.00.  When he asked, they said it was because he was not using Nissan Finance.  Nissan Finance was not part of the deal.  When confronted with text messages and e-mails they asked me to come back in visit with the sales manager.  I believe his name was Mark. (not sure because he did not offer it and when I asked I can not remember what he said) He led me to a back room alone.  When I protested he slammed his pen down on the desk and said ""Don't yell at me"" ""This deal is over"" and got up.  I did not yell I raised my voice intensity a little because I was shocked at the treatment I was getting.  I already have two 2015 Maurano's leased from this dealership yet he was manipulating the situation to blame his lack of integrity and desire to renege on the deal on his customer.  I will never walk back in that dealership and will never recommend any Nissan to anyone I know ever again. Not only did they lie, but they embarrassed me in front of my friend who's daughter is working on a mission in Houston for Samaritans purse and was so excited to get her first new car!

What they told me could not be done and took five minutes to redo. I'm so pissed that I take my contact and never once was I told take you or goodbye. Now after I'm home a be calmer I'm looking over the contract and these sorry xxxxx jacked my original price of Gap from $400 to $895.

Always ask for a cash receipt before handing anything cash over to finance managers. I thought I purchased a 2016 Nissan Rouge on October 1, 2016 and it turns out the finance manager pocketed my $3000 cash down payment and never turned in my application for credit. I pretty much drove a car off the lot for 2 months. No one made me aware of the situation till the middle of December when my first supposed car payment was approaching 12/30. Its not ok that I had to call the General Manager Mark Mefford to ask for clarification. He was completely insensitive and said ""it happens"". In a nutshell they didn't want to give me my money back unless I had a cash receipt. Yes, things were eventually resolved only because I had to contact the OCCC and opened up a case with Nissan Consumer Affairs.

In addition to charging me 1427 dollars more than what we made a deal on, turns out the car has no state inspection as well. I did not know car dealers could sell you car without state inspection. I went in there today asked one of the service employee who himself admitted it is very very rare and was surprised that they sold a new car without state inspection. And this salesperson ""Jesus"" keeps telling us that we had the best deal with cunning smirk. And Nissan says, there is nothing we can do since the paper has already been signed. And on top of it, they have not even send us review as of yet. ",1.0
146,"December 30, 2016","I recently bought 'Nissan Rogue 2016 SV' 2 weeks ago. Since it was year end sales, the price was 19948. We tried to talked them down but they wouldn't. The salesperson named "" Jesus rio "" kept telling us that it would be final price including sales tax and title fee. But somehow after very long bargaining, we managed to talked them down to 19700. Thinking its a right price , both party where 'Okay' and was win-win situation, we went to paperwork. We signed everything without any delay. Unfortunately, we didn't look into numbers. Few days back, while I was going back to those papers just to make my financial plans, I happened to notice that they have added sales tax and title fee on to the amount we made deal on. So I called Jesus, the salesperson, told him about the blunders. He asked me to come over so that they can address the issue. So, we went today. We thought it wouldn't be much of problem because everyone on that day knew about the deal. But turns out, the issue can be only addressed by the manager named "" Michael Vu "" . Since he wasn't there, we waited for him. We were waiting and then Michael Vu storms in with some papers and rudely says "" This is the deal we made, you have already signed the papers, Do what you can. Take legal action if you have to ! I don't care!"" and leaves! I was in a moment of shock for few seconds. He didn't even bother to discuss about the situation. We trusted Nissan with papers and that was our blunder. Thought we were in better deal and both side were on win win situation. At least I thought so. They charged us US dollars 1427 extra. Horrible! Horrible!! experience!!",1.0

They still made me pay for the compressor even though it was sold without a thorough inspection and obviously had problems at the ten day point.

162,"April 06, 2015","1. I had an appointment with Jesse (sales manager) to purchase the vehicle.
    I had negotiated the deal via internet contact and made appointment for 
    5:15pm on 4/3.  He not only was not available for the appointnment but 
    never came out to introduce himself, apologize, etc. 

2. I was told they had the vehicle I wanted. Upon arrival I was told they dont
    have the vehicle and they tried to upgrade to a completely different model
    vehicle priced much higher

3. They told me they could not honor the price I had negotated with the
    interenet sales rep and were unwilling to honor the price until I made
    phone calls to the internet sales rep department

4. I was given a trainee and the sale took 4 hours when I was promised
    everything would be ready when I arrived.  

5. Upon closing the financing, they put a different figure for my trade in
    than what we agreed hoping I would not catch it in the paperwork thus
    giving me less for my trade in than what I had agreed on

6. No one went over the vehicle or its operations with me and by the time
    they finally got the sale completed, it was after 9pm and they just wanted
    to get out of there.

7. I was never thanked for my business

8. The dealership tried to finance me at 5.9  percent even though I qualified for zero percent 
    financing.  When I told them I was leaving, all of a sudden I got the zero percent financing. 

The sales trainee was trying her hardest but was hampered by the sales manager and finance person and their bait and switch games.  This was a very unpleasant experience and the dealership employees will outright lie to get you in the door.  A big fail in ethical business practices.

166,"October 14, 2014","I had emailed the dealership yesterday and was contacted by Jamie and her about the car a 2011 Nissan Altima that they had online for $11,495 Jamie promptly emailed me back and told me that I could come in Tuesday October 14 at 4PM and look at the car and take it for a test drive and set up a deal! She stated that when I arrived there for myself to go to the front desk and ask for her manager Ron Stine and tell him that I was a VIP customer and to give him my name and phone number that way I would not have to go through the whole run around of having to explain what I was looking for again and also about the car that I had inquired about. Her manager Ron emailed me later on that evening and informed me that the car was still available. When I got to the dealership and ask for Ron at the front desk I am told that he is not available so another dealer, Jesus, decides that he is going to take care of the sale. First off it wasn't who I was wanting to talk to and second off he didn't know any of my information so I had to go through the whole spill again. When I went to his desk I had told him that I was looking at the 2011 Nissan Altima that was $11K and that I had a trade in with the Mustang and that was going to be my down payment on the car. So after looking through his computer he was asking me if it was the black or the white one and I told him that it was the black one that was $11k and he said okay let me go grab the keys that way you can take it for a test drive. Got the keys to the Mustang that way they could appraise it while I was test driving the other car. While I was sitting at the desk waiting for him to come back with the keys his personal phone rang. When he got back to the desk before I ever even got to go test drive it he pretty much is ignoring me and decides that he is going to take his personal phone call. After he finally finished with that I walked outside with him and started to look at the car.......and I told him that this wasn't the car that I was talking about because this one had leather seats inside where the other one didn't! He told me well this one and the white one were the only two that I have on the lot! So I proceeded to ask him well how much is this one because the one that I was looking at was 11K and he tells me that he didn't know much this one is but this one and the white one are the only two that I have on the lot! Also this one had 10k more miles on it than the one that I had inquired about! Since I was already there I took it for a test drive and see how it is, still not knowing the price of it mind you not! Take it for a little test drive and go back inside and go back to his desk.......he walks away yet again.....probably the fifth or sixth time at this point and I haven't been there thirty minutes yet!! Comes back to his desk and already has numbers printed of how much it's going to cost me per month and for what time from. Still haven't found out how much this car is and still haven't found out how much my trade in is going to be! So he goes over the paperwork and says that well since you're not doing a down payment your price per month is going to be $325........told him and that's with the trade in? He say's well all we are going to give you for the trade in is $1500 which just floored me! Just by glancing at the paper I also saw that the price of the car that I had test drove was almost $2k more than the price than the one that I was looking at to begin with was never actually told the price of the car! I told him nope that's not going to work I want more for the Mustang and he went on some spill about this or that and I told him that I want my keys so that I can go home.....he said well what will make you happy! I told him that I want at least $7k for the car an of course he says something like well if I can get them to go up to $3500 on the car will that make you happy! Told him yeah sure we will see but I still want more! So he comes back and tells me that he got them to go up to $3500 for the trade in and my car payment would be $291.......I told him you know what that's just not going to work for me I just want my keys and want to go home! He goes on this spill basically about how I am getting top dollar at the dealership and that if I take it home than I am lucky if I get $500-$1k for it! While he's going on his little spill I am looking directly at the paper with the trade in value and it only says $2500 when he directly just told me that I got you $3500 for the car and also I was looking at where they put in the mileage on the paper and it said that it had 115k miles on the car when the car actually only has exactly 84K!! So he goes and talks to his sales manager once again and suddenly they were going to give me $5k for the car and so I sit there and let them bs some more and see what the payments would be and he said well it's going to still be $251 a month for 60 months with a 12% interest rate! I got up and told him that I just want my keys and am ready to take my car and go home! His sales manager comes over and decides to talk to me and goes on the whole what are you looking for what can get you into this car and I ended up telling him nothing and that I just wanted my keys three times!! I felt totally uncomfortable and like something that I didn't want was being pushed on me and I felt that I was being undercut and lied to pretty much the whole time from the not knowing the price, to telling me about the trade in, to lying about the miles on the trade in, to lying about what they were actually going to give me for the trade in, to the dealer constantly getting up and walking away and not saying where he was going, to the lying about having the car but then bringing out something totally different, to the taking a personal phone call right in front of a customer! I felt pushed around and like they were trying to take advantage of me and was in a very uncomfortable situation and there were way too many red flags!! Also the whole time that he was going on about my payments he kept telling me that this would be your price without a down payment and that I could just take the Mustang home instead of even putting it down on the car!

Bought my first brand new Nissan Sentra from them. I am not sure if they are happy with my purchase but I am! (so far). 

The boss is quick in dealing with. He in-fact is the one that made me aware of their offer on the new Nissans. This shouldn't be a surprise, because i am not prepared to buy a Nissan and was eyeing on the other two Japanese brands (pre-owned ones yes). Price wise, they are flexible (I hope now you understand my first statement of the review!). 

The finance guy is also good (I know he may be upset but he doesn't show that to me). So i would appreciate the professionalism. 

Don't want to miss mentioning about my sales person. He helped me go for the right trim. Coz I didn't know the base model sentra didn't come with cruise control, but he made that point to me. A cool young fellow. 

Though dealerships like this work hard to help customers (at the same time think about running their business), some work in terms of preparedness is also required from buyers, to have a good buying experience.

I hope they get more customers to share good buying experiences in the years to come. My journey didn't end here, coz I just bought the car, and hope things go smooth in the future too.

Price - As I said above, because of the way the pricing process works at this dealership, I will always wonder if I could have gotten a lower price.

185,"June 08, 2013","We bought a brand new Nissan in September of 2012 at Nissan of Fort Worth. Most everything was fine until I got home (480 miles round trip) and noticed the inspection sticker had been put on in April.  A new vehicle in Texas is supposed to come with a two year inspection sticker. I contacted them right away and they said instead of putting the sticker on when the vehicle is sold, they put them on when they get the vehicle in. So they cheated me out of my two year inspection sticker. I contacted the TX Department of Public Safety by mail and they told me after a couple of phone calls that they were ""Sorry but there was nothing they could do."" So if the TX DPS can't make the car dealers do right, who can? I think the New Car Automobile Association may have the TX DPS in their pocket. The Chevy dealer in my town puts the stickers on when the vehicle is sold. Both ways can't be right. Here is the regulation:

   2 Yr Stickers
There is a two-year initial inspection period for passenger cars or light trucks meeting the following criteria:
-sold in this state;
-has not been previously registered in this or another state;  and
-on the date of sale is of the current or preceding model year.
Reference Transportation Code §548.102.

I don't know why a car dealer that pretty much did everything right would take this route and ruin what could have been a clean, honest deal. And I know there are a lot of Christians in this state. There must be Christians working at the dealership and at the TX DPS. Why do they screw people? It reflects badly on Christianity. They offered me a small rebate but all I want is my two year sticker that I paid for. And there's no provision in the regulation for not doing it right and then offering a small rebate. That's all off the wall.

Oh, one more thing. At closing with the finance guy I told him to be sure to send the title to the credit union. He nodded knowingly and assured me that they ""do this all the time,"" not to worry. Two weeks later the title arrived at my mailbox. It didn't go to the credit union, their name wasn't on the title as it should have been, nor was my wife's name on it as it should have been.

186,"May 02, 2013",I hate buying a car because of the games and pressure.  But Nissan of Fort Worth has changed my mind.  No one strong-armed me or bullied me.  It was easy and they worked with me.  It was a pleasant experience.  They did what they said they would do and took the stress out of it.  This is the way I always thought I should be able to buy a car. What a breath of fresh air!,5.0

188,"April 22, 2013","I went in there to look at a Nissan Juke and was considering trading in my Nissan Rogue.  Nissan sent me a letter stating they'd give me $19000 for my trade in.  Of course there was lots of fine print to qualify that.  We had 3 people dealing with us and two of the three had to keep going somewhere to check the price.  First they came back with a trade-in value of $11000 and told me that the average mileage driven each year is $10000 miles so they deduct anything over that.  Not sure where you can live and drive an average of 10000 miles per year but it surely isn't DFW.  When they saw that wasn't working, they went away and came back with a better trade-in but I still wasn't going for it.  Went away again and came back with a great trade-in value.  However, that's when i noticed they decreased the incentive we'd been working with.  They think they're slick and the customer won't notice because they're dealling with the trade-in value.  I noticed and that's when I was done with them.  I don't deal with slicksters and that's what they are in there.They gang up on you.  The actual sales person - Ali - was very nice.  Unfortunately, Ali had to work with the slicksters.  The took my keys when we first got there and although I asked many times for them, they wouldn't return them.  I finally demanded them and when I got loud enough for other customers to hear, they finally returned my keys.  I wouldn't buy a car from these people if they were giving them away.",2.4

190,"February 26, 2013","Made 3 separate trips to come look at a car. First was during their tent sale, which was understandably busy, so we decided to come back later. Made an appointment with Candice to come look at a car, showed up and were told she was gone for the day and the car we were wanting to look at could not be found. The salesman was too pushy and didn't want to work out a decent deal with us. Just looked at my trade in and said they couldn't give the price which I wanted for it; mind you this was a 3 year old car in perfect condition and always serviced at the dealership. Just wanted to trade it in for a better gas mileage vehicle. The several other dealerships we've been to gave us close to the price we wanted which was slightly more than KBB. These people didn't even try to give me a number with which they were willing to deal, just flat out said no we can't give you that price. We left and Candice called and apologized and asked if we would come back and specifically asked for her next time and verified that the car was still there. Came back and drove around the tiny lot to look for a parking spot and to see if the car was indeed there, if it was we didn't see it in parking lot. Walked into the dealership and was asked if we had an appointment so we said. ""Yes, with  Candice."" The guy walked around looking for her and then tried to call her but I didn't see him speak to anyone while on the phone. He returned and told us she was unavailable, but would be more than happy to show us what we were looking for, but by that time we have had it with this unorganized and pushy dealership so we walked out. Overall, with the 3 separate trips up there, the dealership is tiny, unorganized, and had horrible customer service. The used car sales side looked a mess. The sitting and waiting area looks and feels like you're in line at the DMV waiting to speak to somebody. I don't even know why corporate Nissan lets them stay in business. Oh, and the car that we wanted remained on their website for several weeks afterwards before it was finally taken off. ",1.0

We found a 2012 Rogue SL on their web site. John Vee was the salesman assigned us. We agreed to the sale price. Emailed a scanned copy of hte tradein value sheet offered us by the local Nissan dealer. We agreed on the tradein (contingent upon our honesty I am sure) We offered a downpayment via electronic check or credit card.
he agreed to run our credit card and remove the car from the website. The next day it was still on he web. We called and asked for a sales manager, got Travis Cardoza, asked why it had not been removed and Why we had NOT recieved a sales contract.
( he Emailed a for internal use only form showing a higher base price but a higher rebate offer and the SAME agreed to price) NOT a sales contract. A week goes by with not a word. Our card was NEVER charged the down payment Nor did we ever get a sales contract. I called at after 5 pm, got a Business Development manager ( Ashley) She was to find out what had happen, the original salesman DID call us at 741 pm and offer his cell ( we were gone), stated he left several messages and was waiting to hear from me.

197,"September 27, 2012","Misleading advertising by salesperson (Ashley) and no customer service.  Had checkbook in hand to buy a used car and was never shown a car.
I purchased a Nissan Altima for my niece to use at college.  She hit a light pole turning the corner and bent the frame.  I am in the market for another car for her, using the insurance money plus some.  I contacted Nissan of Fort Worth (Texas) regarding an internet advertisement for a used car they had for sale.  I called and spoke with Ashley Morrison.  Ashley confirmed the car was still available; this was 6:55pm.  I made an appointment for 7:30pm.  She said that she would get it cleaned up for me and ready for 7:30pm.  I arrived at 7:20pm.  I was told Ashley would be right with me.  I waited 10 minutes and no one showed.  I asked again and was told Ashley was in the other new car sales building.  I walked over there and asked for her, and waiting 20 minutes.  No Ashley.  I asked again if she was there.  They said to go back to used car building and she would be right over.  I walked back to used car building, waited 5 minutes, no Ashley.  Finally a salesman asked if he could help me.  I explained what was going on.  He made a call and said Ashley is in the new car building, and he walked with me back to new car building.  He went to get her.  He came back and apologized, said she did not have time to see me.  He said that the car was loaded on the auction truck today about 5pm and is no longer here.  I was not happy, having called ahead to confirm it was available, confirmed appointment, had my checkbook ready, and then given the runaround for 35 minutes, and finally told it was not available and the person I had an appointment with refused to see me.  Ashley never came out to talk to me.  The salesman got a manager, Nick Carbaciu.  He was polite and went to talk to Ashley.  He came back and said she had left.  He asked the salesman to locate another used car similar and make me a good deal at cost, that he would authorize it.  He was supposed to call Lee to authorize it for the salesman.  I walked back to used car building with salesman.  We waited 10 minutes; Lee was nowhere to be found.  Another “manager” was called over.  The salesman explained to this manager my situation and this guy was of no help.  He explained that “just happens sometimes, not their fault”.  I explained that Ashley mislead me about the vehicle being available and then refused to see me when I arrived for our appointment.  The “manager” explained that he found customers lied to them more than his employees lie to customers.  I found that offensive, given the circumstances, as I was not lying, just telling him what happened to me.  I finally got tired of waiting.  After 55 minutes, and no used car to show me, I left.  They have my number, but doubt they will call me.  There is a pervasive customer service problem at this location or within the organization, and this type of teaser advertising to get customers to come to your lot should be illegal or at least prohibited within a reputable company (which I though Nissan was, but not sure anymore).

198,"September 24, 2012","Wasted our time. Advertised cars that are not even on the dealer's lot anymore and when you call to ask them they will tell you they still have it just so you will make an appointment to come in and test drive it. Once you get there, a salesman will ask you if you have an appointment with someone in particular and will ""try to look for that person,"" he will come back and say that person is ""busy"" or ""unavailable."" This happened to us on 2 separate occasions. The salesman walked around ""trying to look for that particular person"" when they have a PA system, or picked up a phone to ""dial a number"" but never talked to anyone. They will then ask if they can have your info even before showing you the car you were coming to look at. After they get your info, they will show you a different car because the car you saw online had just recently sold. It is ridiculous how unorganized they are. How hard is it to be available for an appointment that you've made with a customer. The dealership lot is tiny, there are hardly any parking spots available to park. The Subaru dealership next door gets pissed if you park in their lot. Would never do business with them again.",2.4

200,"September 05, 2012","We called Nissan of Ft. Worth to set up a test drive on a Grey 2009 Nissan Rogue. We set up the test drive with Heather, who stated that she was the Head of Internet Sales. We drove 2 hours to test drive the vehicle and were directed to Cade Payne, who initially seemed very friendly, helpful, and ready to make a deal. Once we arrived Cade attempted to track down the vehicle which we later found out had been sold the previous day. Cade wanted to then show us a Black 2010 that he believed he could get into our previously stated price range. We weren't looking for a black vehicle and were pretty irritated about being misled so we left our information with Cade and he stated that he would let us know as soon as any Rogues in our price range came back onto the lot. This was Saturday and the dealership was closed on Sunday. Monday morning we were ready to look at cars again being that it was Labor Day and a good day to buy. Monday a man named Jesse contacted us and wanted to set up a test drive from a selection of several Rogues that had come in over the weekend. We then contacted Heather again to confirm which vehicles were physically on the lot and ready to sell. Heather informed us that she had 2 vehicles that would be perfect for us. 1- a Blue 2009 Rogue that fit into our price range and 2. a 2009 Grey Rogue but she recommended that we try for the 2010 that was on the lot because she believed it would still fit into our price range. We immediately loaded up into the car and travelled the 2 hours again to Nissan of Fort Worth. We kept in contact with Heather the whole drive periodically confirming that the vehicles were on site. I attempted multiple times to speak with Cade, as I had believed him to be helpful and friendly. Cade never called back or answered any texts that were sent to him, even though he had told me before that phone calls and texts to him were the best way to get ahold of him. Once we arrived on the lot we immediately asked for Cade and were referred to a nice young man that drove us around on a golf cart looking for Cade. Once Cade was located, he could be seen sitting at the side of the dealership with another salesperson smoking. As soon as we neared the door he headed toward the back of the dealership and we never saw him again. The nice young man then attempted to help us the best he could. He did tell us that BOTH vehicles that we had driven to look at had been sold before 9 am that morning. We had been talking with Heather since 10 am and she continually assured us the vehicles were on site. Their excuse for this was that the website was run by a third party company that cannot keep up with the influx of sales of such a high volume dealership. I called BS and accepted the fact that they again were just trying to get us into the door to make a deal. They still had a 2008 and a 2009 they let us drive and wanted us to try to buy. We really liked the 2009 and were ready to make the deal, but when we sat down with the salesperson his manager came out and told us that what we were willing to offer was far too low. I explained to the manager that we had told everyone we had spoken to what our top dollar price was and we were assured that Nissan of Fort Worth had a Rogue that we could get into. He again stated that they could not come off of the price and I thanked him for his time and walked out. Very irritated due to the fact that I was upfront with what I was willing to do as far as purchase price and the dealership was not willing to do the same even though I drove 2 hours twice to try and get into a vehicle. Since then I have had 2 different dealerships with similar cars work out possible deals with me on 2009 Rogues of the same mileage and basic package set up. Very misleading and dishonest sales practices. I would not recommend this dealership to anyone.",1.8

We have been assured and assured that the company is great and we will have no problems, so I am reserving my opinion of this dealer until I see how the first few months of payments with this finance company go.  If it turns out that this finance company really is ok, then I will have no bad review for Nissan of Fort Worth.  If, however, it turns out what everyone says about this company is true, then I will have a bad review for Nissan of Fort Worth because they sell you into this finance company knowing how they are.  I will update in a few months after we see how it really goes.  

As far as the sales staff, our salesman was a very smooth talker, not sure at this point if that was genuine or just trying to make the sale for this bad finance company.  So again, that will have to be reserved until we see how it goes for a few months.

One big complaint that may or may not have to do with the finance company is the price of the car.  The sticker said $16,000 with all the options listed that were on the car.  Then, when financing was done, the price suddenly jumped to $19,900 because ""the sticker was wrong and didn't really include the options on the car"".  Come to find out, this finance company who they put us through charges a 2000-4000 fee to finance people, so that's why they jacked up the price of the car.  Not happy about that or about them lying to us.  Now we already owe almost double on a brand new car than it's worth (as far as the principal balance, no interest included).",2.2

Through all of this the dealership doesn't seem to care.  I even filed a complaint with the Attorney Generals Office and that doesn't even bother the Dealership.  When I get my Refund I will not step foot onto that dealership again and thanks to them I won't own another Nissan EVER, and they make a few vehicles that I like a lot but they have ruined the Nissan name for me and I tell everyone I can not to go there, and not buy a Nissan because Nissan USA customer service is also no help what so ever.",1.6
222,"September 02, 2009","Finally, an Internet sales team that knows what the word Internet means. I can't express enough the loathing I felt towards car dealers before going to Nissan of Fort Worth. Being a no nonsense type of person, nearly a month later I'm still in awe at how quick and painless my car buying experience was.

I'd done my research and was prepared for battle. There was no need for battle, I was treated with respect and at no time during the process did I feel my intelligence was being insulted.

Communication of all forms was done in a timely manner. When they said they'd call or email, they did.

Highly recommend the Internet department at Nissan of Fort Worth.",5.0
223,"December 09, 2008"," I bought several cars from this dealership and loved every purchase, but if you should need a repair done GOODLUCK! This dealership sucks at repairs, you have to return your car at least 2 or 3 times to get the problems resolved. Oh, don't even bother talking to the manager cuz he could care less. I know this sounds crazy, but only buy cars from them and leave repairs up to another dealership.",1.8

226,"August 07, 2006","Turned in my vehicle before the lease was up and paid the lease off-however, they misplaced my vehicle on the lot, locked the paperwork inside. NMAC continued to contact me for the vehicle and to pay off the remainder of the loan.  Thornhill denied having the vehicle until I demanded that they physically walk in the lot -they found it. Took forever for them to fax the odometer reading in. NMAC is still trying to close down the account-but have a collection agency calling me daily to get the remaining 11,000 dollars owed since ""we didn't return the vehicle"" I am outraged. At the time that we turned in our vehicle, we decided to put out a new lease on a new vehicle at nissan.  We put down $424 deposit. The dealership had to get the vehicle from another dealership. THe next day we decided on a Toyota and cancelled and,even thought i felt bad, we backed out on the Nissan.  Now the dealership won't give our money back because they had to pay to get the vehicle we initially wanted.  I feel that since they are the cause of our problems regarding the first vehicle, that should erase the $424 off my credit card to make up for the collection agency harassing me for the mistake they made!!",1.4
227,"May 17, 2005","I took my Altima in because it was overheating.  They told me that I needed a new radiator, for $600.  After they installed the new radiator, they did a pressure test and found that the water pump was leaking.  $200 to fix that.  Then they discovered that the fan motor needed to be replaced, and so did some hoses.  By the time I was done, it cost $1100.  On the way home, the car overheated and the oil light came on!  I went straight back, and then they found that there was no oil in the engine!  They said that whoever changed the oil last had not replaced the seal in the oil cap.  Well, guess who changed the oil last?  They did!  I firmly believe that most of those repairs were not required.  But that is not the end.  While they were putting oil into the car, the service advisor told me that there was oil leaking into the distributor, and it was all gunked up with oil and needed to be replaced.  I said ""Show me"".  We walked back to the car, and she asked the mechanic to show us the oil in the distributor.  The mechanic had no idea what she was talking about.  There was nothing wrong with the distributor.Their salesmen are real sharks, too.  They approach me when I am dropping my car off for service and try to talk me into trading my car for a new one.  And they don't take no for an answer.  Even after I told one of them that I wasn't interested, he kept asking me ""If I could get you a new Altima for $300/month, would you buy it?""No way!  I would never buy from that dealer again.",1.3
