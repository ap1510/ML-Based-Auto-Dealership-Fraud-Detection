16,"January 11, 2020","Worthless service. I took my 2019 F150 to service several times for different issues (excessive oil consumption) they said it was normal. At 8000 miles the check engine light turn on “cam shaft position xxxxxxxx” they just delete the code and said it was normal again , they said everything was working fine. The truck vibrated when idle and made knocking sounds. The check engine light appeared again, I had no choice but to trade in my F150 for a Toyota Tundra. Thanks to lack of support from the service department.  I will never have any business with viva ford anymore.",1.0

I was glad the issue was promptly resolved and I received my car back after a much needed car wash as well.

45,"January 14, 2019","Every time I set foot into the collision center at Viva Ford I leave more upset than when I came in. Not only will this be the THIRD time they repainted my vehicle due to paint not matching, every time they give it back it seems to have an added problem (clunking sounds, dead battery, etc.) and the estimator I have been working with (Daniel Cruz) just seems to continue to tell me things with a smile as if bad service is a wonderful thing, and I am ignorant to the state of my vehicle (I.e. “this is a hard color to match” and “it looks different in different lights so maybe you can’t see it”. They have these signs up and then reassure you that your paint will match, and they will detail and vacuum your vehicle, neither of these things were done, and the first time I came to pick up my vehicle I asked if I could schedule for it to go directly over to service for a routine oil change and tire rotation, I was told that it could be taken care of for me and I couldn’t need to handle it. It was not taken care of, and I picked up my vehicle still in need of service. I am almost positive the only thing they managed to find correctly on my vehicle was the radio dial, and that my now dead battery has something to do with that. I will never recommend this collision center and will definitely never come back, given this is the last opportunity they have to correct their mistakes. ",1.4
46,"January 01, 2019","Had the worst experience here...to them you’re just a number. Sales people promise so much but underdelivered in every aspect. Had to get an alignment done on front tires, have the oil reset and get an odd noise checked out on a new (used) vehicle we bought there. These people decided to keep the vehicle TWO WHOLE days and did nothing to it and still had the nerve to turn in the vehicle with no keys....!!! Luckily we brought spares. To top this off, they drove the vehicle around after filling up the tank and left their Burger King bags in the vehicle WITH FOOD!!!! Our vehicle reeked of fast food and we didn’t even get the “complementary” wash they promised. Overall VERY very disappointed with the service there. Never have I been treated so poorly and met people working in sales to be this irresponsible and have such a lack of appreciation and respect for customers. They promise so much before a deal but once you sign, those promises hold no value and you become just another person to them. Should’ve known from the start with all the runaround...won’t be going back and definitely won’t ever recommend their dealership!! Save yourself time and hassle and buy elsewhere it’s not worth it!!",1.0

50,"March 28, 2018","I purchased a new Ford Fusion from Viva Ford back in December 2017.  Its a great car but I was very unpleased with the customer service I received.  It was a new car and they did a horrible job cleaning it when I picked it up.  There was tape and tape residue in the back window, and I had to keep going back to the dealership to resign paperwork that they lost or to get things that should have been given to me when I pick up the car.  It took them over a month to get me the second key and the users manual.  Its now the end of March and they have still not been able to get me my tags.  They can't tell me when they sent the paperwork for my tags or when they will come in.  The only thing that they can tell me is they are coming.  I would not only not recommend Viva Ford if you are buying a car, new or used, I would not recommend Viva Ford for anything.",2.0
51,"February 09, 2018","Very deceptive business practices at Viva Ford.  Not dealerships in alameda are as grimy and sketchy as VIVA Ford. I WAS ACTUALLY SOLD AN EXTENDED WARRANTY THAT WAS EXPIRED 3 YEARS AGO, AND I BOUGHT THE CAR ONLY SIX MONTHS AGO!!

87,"May 22, 2017","This dealership tried to put a spot delivery scam on me, what is called a yoyo finance, they took my vehicle after 50 days as i found out my paperwork was never finalized by them. The dealership called me for money as a down payment. I payed insurance right away $260 for those two months which the finance dept told me they would not give me refund for any expenses I've made toward the car. I also bought new Air filter, fixed oil drain plug and change oil change costing me $109 dollars. I also tinted windows price i payed was $100. As i found out they haven't return my down payment and my auto expenses. To be this kind of dealership, I assumed they were pretty legitimate. The finance department (Armando), made excuse after excuse. The bank which i was told finance my deal, called me saying my deal was never finalized, so i could'nt make my first payment. I loved that vehicle. Also I gave my previous car to my parents as a gift, when i bought mine at this dealership, now a parent of three I have no car, which is making this a very difficult problem. I will file complaints on  Attorney General Office, Better Business Bureau. Shame on you VIVA FORD, EL PASO TX.",1.0

113,"July 08, 2016","This review is not to bash Viva Ford, but to warn other car buyers out there. So we got to this dealership to browse the used car selection and I am quickly approached by a seller. The seller introduces himself and after viewing an test driving a couple of cars, I fall in love with a 2014 Ford Fusion. 

I fully understand that Used Cas are sold ""As Is"". So I do a thorough inspection, I check for the spare tire, check under the hood, check the tires, etc etc.Once inside before starting the paperwork I ask the seller clearly. ""The car has the extra/spare key correct?"" He responds, ""yes it does"". We do not haggle to lower cost of the car since everything was good and price was decent. Please keep this in mind as it is the issue I have with this dealership.

After a couple of hours pass with the seller preparing paperwork and running credit checks, we finally head to the financial office were a woman meets us to sign the final contract (and offer us an additional used car warranty). Before we walk into the office , we asked the seller if he could hand us the spare key , and he tells us , ""uhhh, sorry but that car does not have a spare key."" At that point I'm a bit upset because that was one of my main concerns. We go into the lady's office and I explain the situation and her response was, ""we'll our used cars are sold as is"". I respond,, ""well I understand that, but when I sat down to negotiate with the seller I asked him that and he confirmed that the spare key was available. Had I known that, I may have worked out a deal to get the price reduce by to the cost of the spare key or have they order one as part of the deal"".  Her response well there's nothing we can do. At this point (4hrs at the dealership), I say whatever let's get on with it. As the financial lady goes over the loan and the contract she tries to sell us the extended warranty. She goes over the different warranties and what they cover and as she sees we don't want the additional coverage she has the audacity to say well if you buy the extra coverage, about $2,000 extra we can throw in the spare key. At this point I feel like they're slapping me in the face. I refuse the additional coverage and we buy the car without the spare key. I could have walked away, but I had already invested(more like wasted) so much of my 4th of July day there. 

So just beware guys they are fast to approach you, but slow to process paperwork.

And also make sure that they hand you or show you what your looking for up front. You want to waste your time like I did and later find out they lied.

Seems like I'm making a big deal for a spare key. I've read that these spare keys Ford switch blade style key fob run at about $400 for with dealership programming fees. And with ford you need 2 keys in order to program a third one yourself. Since we only have 1 set it will be a bit more costly.

If it had been an honest mistake by the seller, I think we should have been able to work something out as it is key for proper customer service. The seller was to preoccupied to get a sale that he didn't do his due diligence to answer the questions we had.

I purchased a car in Phoenix were they flew me out there, were prompt, and quick at processing paperwork. Way better customer service. This made me realize that I should go write them a positive review as this experience made me realize the difference in customer service.

Called again early afternoon - voice mail.  Received a call back that my car was ready for pickup.  

So I went.  Waited five minutes to be acknowledged.  The service guy called me on my cell while I was standing there in front of him to be waited on.

Bruce the salesman was awesome but because of Paco in finance I would never recommend anyone to this dealership. I have signed a cancelation for the warranty but he wasnt going to process ituntil next Friday so this headache isisn't over and I pray they fix the problem. Beware of Paco he seems nice but he is deceptive. UPDATE : The dealership has fixed my loan they have fixed my warranty. I appreciate their efforts to fix what I was unhappy with. It was stressful the last few days but they fixed the problem and Im thrilled its fixed and over!",3.0
171,"January 25, 2014","Awful awful experience.. went to order a 2014 Ford Raptor SE.. And trade in a 2013 Ford Raptor. We had an appointment and arrived early. .. When we got there the sales guy barely even acknowledged us... We were shuffled between 3 different people all of whom said 2 words to us.... They insulted us with a very very low trade in value almost $10k under what another dealership offered us.  Joe, the sales manager as well as our sales person were very rude.  And when I tried to ask for my keys back I was told ""Oh someone will get them for you eventually"" even with a nasty look by Joe. I have never been more insulted by a dealership in my life. Not to mention issues I've had with their service department as well. It doesn't deserve the one star I gave it. ",1.0
172,"January 04, 2014",They sold me a car that looks good on the outside but has been wrecked. The car fax  they gave me does not show it has been in a wreck. But the back bumper has been replaced and all if the bolts around the trunk and the hood are striped which is another sign of car being taken   apart                    and  put back together. There are other indications the car has      been in a collision.,1.0
173,"September 06, 2013","Went to viva ford to look trucks, after I decided what I wanted promises were made. If I would finance thru ford credit @8.9 % they would give me a better discount, with a GUARANTEE of refinance at 3% or lower of buy truck back, and a refund of the interest occurred while refinance went thru. Well they never came thru with the 3% much less the refund. I was already approved with a credit union at 2.10% so it worked out for me. Mr. Avalos cant be trusted. I have videos to prove my case of their promises. Even with this its been a month and no refund. ",1.8

175,"March 23, 2012","So I buy a brand new 2012 Ford Fusion SE from Viva Ford (5550 N. Desert Blvd). They offered to have my windows tinted as part of the purchase. I buy the car and take the car home. I brought it back a few days later so they can have the car windows tinted. They outsource the work to a local business. When I go back to pick up the car I find that the window tints have a lot of deficiencies. I asked the dealership to have them redone. A few days later I turned over the vehicle to have the tints redone. When I go back to pick up the vehicle for a second time, I notice deep, disgusting, long scratches on my back window! and the tints were still not done right! They refused to replace the window. Not only that, but they want ME to go to the local window tint business to get them redone. 

They are total scammers. A brand new car looks like trash because of them. They refuse to take responsibility like a bunch of crooked salespeople. Stay away from Viva Auto Group. They will never be honest with you. Their goal is to get you and and spit you out as quickly as possible.   ",1.0
176,"February 04, 2012","When the process first started the experience was great and so were the employees. However, that went downhill when it took over a week to get the contracts for our vehicle! We were told that our deal was processed and that all we needed was to come in and get our paperwork.(Paco) This is when we were told that the deal was not closed and that loan was not approved yet. An est 3 days later the papers were finally signed and we were asked to bring our vehicle back in for an inspection and cleaning. The dealership had our vehicle for the entire day. 3 weeks had gone by and we called to check on our tags only to find out that no one had any clue as to what we were talking about. After 8 phone calls and speaking with 10 people we were told that they were going to look into it and call us back within 1-2 days ( This was with Manny the sales MGR). We never recieved a phone call back, we had left messages for the salesman(Robert)and he also never returned our calls. We finally had to call them about the problem yet again. We were told to bring the vehicle to the dealership to straighten everything out and that we would be taken care of before leaving. This would be fine but we found out that the vehicle was never sent for an inpection, that they had the truck that entire day just washing it, that the title/tags/registration had never been filed for, and that there was no staff available to do an inspection. Which means another 50 miles put on this vechile again to just have nothing done yet again! But this is all acceptable to them because they are going to make it all up with a free carwash and 5 gallons of gas! wooohoo! Way to go team! Overall this experience has been very exhausting, unsatisfactory to say the least, and very unprofessional on thier part! Unfortunatly, this nightmare is still not over considering after a little over month this vehicle still is not in our names, inspections, and etc is still not done. Crazy seeing that they have already cashed our down payment check and we are expected to pay a payment shortly for a vehicle that is still known to be owned by VIVA Ford! At this point I have contacted the GM and awaiting a return call...     ",1.7
177,"December 01, 2011","Do NOT trust their service department they don't care if they diagnose your vehicle wrong, they are only out to make money.  They tried for 2 seconds to find out what was wrong and told us we had a seized engine.  It's not rocket science that if you can turn the crank shaft your motor DID NOT seize. They refused to refund their ""hour of service"" that I doubt they spent on my car.  They were just looking to sell us another vehicle and didn't even try to find the problem.  We found the problem ourselves once we got our car home and now it is running again.  I wish we'd never set foot there- we told them our problem with them and they shrug their shoulders like they don't even care.  The General Manager's response to our issue?  Sorry I sell cars I don't fix them.  Good job VIVA Ford you just lost a customer- We went across the street to Rudolph Chevrolet and were treated with respect and given a great deal.",1.4
178,"October 05, 2011","On 10-4-2011 at 1pm, I went to the service department and spoke to Gilbert Carbajal at Viva  Ford (5550 N. Desert Blvd) El Paso, Texas . I wanted and oil change and inspection on my F150. He said it would be ready about 2:30. At 3pm, I returned to pick up the truck. IT WAS NOT READY! I waited until almost 5pm to pick up the truck.  What's even worse is that I had a $76.08 credit with Viva. I took my truck in a couple of months ago to have the oxygen sensor replaced. They charged me and later found out that it was covered under warranty.  They sent me a letter with the $76.08 credit. When I tried to use it, Gilbert 
Carbajal said he would need management approval. He returned and said that they would not give me the credit and would not return the letter. I think that it is a sad day when a company like Viva will sell their INTEGRITY as a company for $76.08. I have bought 3 vehicles from Viva in the past 4 years. This doesn't sound like a very good way to maintain a customer relation. ",1.6
179,"January 10, 2011","I walked into dealership knowing exactly what I wanted. I was greeted and welcomed not like just another customer. They give each customer the special attention they need. My Viva Ford experience was absolutely wonderful. The price they gave me for a 2010 For Raptor was incredible and it beat all other dealers in El Paso, Texas. The entire staff trested me with respect and everthing was done in a professional manner. If you need a new Ford, I personally recommend Viva Ford

P.S. I LOVE MY NEW TRUCK",5.0

As a Sales person myself I love to see people do their job with passion and professionalism - in this case, I believe it showed. Her follow-up call was friendly and useful, and made my overall experience with this particular dealer all the better. Thank you Carla for putting that extra care that shows and endears your customers to you. ",5.0
