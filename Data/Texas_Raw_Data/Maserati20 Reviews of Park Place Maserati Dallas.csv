1,"January 02, 2020","Excellent service and customer service. They know how to treat a demanding clientele. I’ve been happy with their service on my Maserati for 3 years, even though I drive over 100 miles to Park Place Maserati service. ",5.0
2,"September 07, 2019",Took my Maserati Levante for annual maintenance and service manager Sharon Stanley was very welcoming and got my vehicle in and out fairly quickly with a super nice wash looking brand new.  She provided excellent customer service and I never felt like I was in a snooty environment even though there were exotic vehicles galore on display.  The mechanic was super friendly too. Would definitely go back. Not overpriced like the other dealerships.,5.0

4,"April 02, 2019","My husband had been talking to Maserati dealer ship for over 4 months planning, looking, and telling them everything I wanted so he could surprise me for my birthday. The Maserati dealership went above and BEYOND what was expected. Not only did they keep in contact with my husband but they search for months and months trying to find the EXACT Maserati Levante I had dreamed of! After they finally found the EXACT Maserati levante sparkling white paint, blacked out tires, and GORGEOUS red leather interior with black stitching they immediately called my husband. When it came down to us getting ready to go pick up my BRAND new luxury SUV everything was taken care of, and we lived 5 1/2 hours away! ALL the paper work was handled all we have to do is sign a few papers, pay the deposit, and get the keys! They even were generous and kind enough to give us money off of the sticker price!  NO long dreadful hours of waiting to go through TONS and TONS of paper work! All the people at the Maserati dealership are so inviting and welcoming as soon as you step foot into there door way, no matter your apperiance or what you drive up in. HANDS DOWN the best more amazing experience I have ever had with a car dealership! Theaserati dealership even took the time to go find the behest red bow to put on top of the levante for my arrival. Thank you so much Maserati for making my experience so memorable! ",5.0
5,"February 12, 2019","Life teaches you many lessons over time.  Some of them we learn quick and well.  Some take a great deal of time and/or pain.  I'm sharing this so you might avoid learning first-hand a lesson on luxury/exotic cars I have learned.

Park Place and I'm sure dealers like them offer an inviting and pleasant buying experience.  If you are looking for your dream Maserati or Bentley etc., they will seemingly do anything to please you... and help you sign on the dotted.  BUT what they will not do is tell you the financial hit you will likely take in a handful of years on your ""investment"".   In my experience with Maserati... you'll lose 75% of the car value in under 5 years.  NO KIDDING.  Oh, even if you think you can trade into another vehicle at Park Place down the road, they will gladly give you 25% less than market value on your trade-in to do business with them again!

Let me add that their 'preferred' non-manufacturer financing partners like Woodside Credit are great up front too... they will gladly write you a finance deal despite knowing you'll be massively underwater in a short time... and never mention that up front of course.

My advice to you.  Get your dream car used, perhaps 4 or more years old where it has been well cared for.  And NOT from Park Place.  You can still get low miles but you can use normal financing where the lender will make sure risks are rational or they won't underwrite.",2.6
6,"August 17, 2018",I worked long distance with Adriana during my car buying experience. She were very helpful and professional durning the entire process. I would definitely buy another car from Adriana and Park Place of Dallas.,5.0
7,"March 24, 2018","Adriana was wonderful.  At many places, the moment you write the check, they forget who you are.  At Park Place Bentley, that's just the beginning of a great experience.   ",4.8
8,"March 16, 2018",Park Place took great care of me on my 10 year old Maserati Granturismo! My car was towed in on a Sat night at 11:00 pm and I was called first thing Mon morning that it was there! Great relief just right there! Service was done which was a major job and I had my car back in 5 days!,4.6
9,"February 07, 2018","I have purchased 3 vehicles from Park Place and each time the experience has been excellent. Everyone from sales to support are very attentive and accomodating and strive to make the experience a good one.  
I would recommend Park Place anytime.",5.0
10,"November 11, 2017","We had a great experience from start to finish, including Adrianna and Tim! We recommend Park Place Maserati Dallas and Adrianna and Tim as well!",5.0
11,"October 31, 2017","After dreaming of purchasing a Lotus for many years, I finally decided to pull the trigger and after calling Park Place Premiere Collection regarding a vehicle in inventory that I was interested in, was connected with Adriana. She was an absolute pleasure to work with from start to finish! 

Not only was she incredibly courteous and professional, but she was very knowledgeable about the vehicle I was interested in purchasing as well as model year differences between the latest model and the vehicle I was considering. From the test drive on Saturday to driving off the lot on Tuesday, Adriana handled the entire transaction with the professionalism and customer care that was of the highest caliber - even suggesting that I contemplate utilizing their in-house Financing team when my personal bank came back with a rate slightly hirer than I expected (Park Place Finance Team was able to beat it!). 

I'd absolutely recommend Adriana for your next high-end luxury car purchase as she was committed to earning your business as a satisfied and happy long-term customer over making an individual sale. She didn't want me to buy a vehicle, she wanted me to be happy with the vehicle I bought. Won't be the last one I buy from her for sure!

Finally, I'll note that while I dealt almost entirely with Adriana throughout the entire experience (and this was actually VERY much appreciated versus the typical ""dealership shuffle""), the entire Park Place Premiere Collection team was always courteous, welcoming, kind, and professional at every interaction. They say you get what you pay for, but Adriana and the team at Park Place earned every bit of my business!",5.0
12,"October 17, 2017","Adriana was AMAZING!
Not only does Park Place have a great reputation and is a great company, this particular employee met and exceeded our expectations when purchasing our beautiful Maserati. She made the entire experience simple and pain free. 
She can definitely sell and can make a sale too! Considering we were coming in to just test drive the car, we left signing all documents.  SHE MADE IT HAPPEN! She was not ready to allow us to leave without the Maserati. A very valuable asset to Park Place
She was not only professional but very personable, polite and friendly, and displayed a lot of knowledge in the car mechanism and details of operating the vehicle.
I have been telling all my friends that if only all other customer service industries had more Adriana's, customers would leave very pleased like how we did.
Overall a WOW experience because of her!

13,"October 15, 2017","My family met with Adriana Boas and she could not have been more pleasant, inviting or hospitable.  It was the best car shopping experience ever!!  She was allowed us to explore at our own pace.  She was a wealth of knowledge and eagerly answered all of our questions.  We entered the dealership with no intention of purchasing or leasing a Maserati, but left with it on our list of options!  She was just wonderful!",5.0
14,"August 15, 2017","Diego Martinez was excellent in getting my car in and out in record time, an nice loaner 2017 Mase and my car was fixed and cleaned to the max.",5.0
15,"March 28, 2017",Car in three times now within two months for same problem.  Car starts first thing then will not restart after stopping.  In service for two weeks now with no answers.  Still waiting for the loaner car the dealership promises for service.  Unhelpful staff.  Do not by a car from Park Place. ,1.0
16,"May 12, 2015",Patrick Harris  - Best Car Dealer I have ever dealt with! Hands Down the best! Only wants what is best for the customer.  Will use again.,5.0
17,"April 14, 2015","From start to finish, working with Patrick at Maserati Dallas was excellent.  Started as just window shopping a new Ghibli, to discussing lease options, even comparing to other dealer options.  Patrick went above and beyond to locating the perfect Ghibli setup to my specifications and delivery was a happy surprise as it was ready to go before expected and in gorgeous detail shape.
Would certainly recommend him (and already have) to friends/family and even clients at my private aviation firm.  Look forward to working together again on the next one!",5.0
18,"April 01, 2015","On March 3rd 2015 I bought a Maserati from Park Place Dealership in Dallas and have had horrible service. I bought the car on Tuesday, I wrote a check and due to bad weather it was delayed. I was threatened to have the car repossessed on that Friday.  Then while driving down the freeway (I-35) I hit a pothole and the strut is cracked and the rim is bent. I understand that happens with low profile tires and I am ok with it, but not the strut.  I have had the car 6 days and the paint is pealing off the rims on the tire. No scratches or damage on that tire that the paint is peeling off of. I understand hitting the pothole is partly my fault but to have the strut is break and it didn’t even blow the tire. The dealership is telling me that it is not covered under warranty and I am going to have to pay for all the repairs. These people have been rude and will not take care of the $100,000 junk car that they have sold me.  I do not recommend ever buying from Park Place Dealership because they are unprofessional and do not stand behind their word. ",1.0
19,"January 26, 2014","Although I didn't buy a car from Brian Simmons on 1/20/14, he was terrific!
I went there because I was only interested in an S-550 Blue used Mercedes that was on the lot. After a test drive, I realized it was not the car for me. Brian, without being arrogant or pushy, took the time to tell me about Jaguar, as he knew it fell into my price range. I had absolutely no interest in the car, but by the time he was done he actually got me to go sit in one. If it wasn't for the fact that the car was way too small for me I actually might have bought it. My experiace with Brian was great and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend him to anyone interested in the Luxury Brands he sells.
