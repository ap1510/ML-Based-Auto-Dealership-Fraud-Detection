0,"September 07, 2019","On August 15, 2019, Autonation Mitsubishi at 7200 Gulf Freeway replaced the oil in my 2004 Mitsubishi Endeavor and ordered parts to repair a plugged AC evaporator that was spraying water on the passenger floor board.  When the evaporator parts arrived, my car was there for 1  1/2 days, i.e., 8/21 & 8/22/19. A small oil leak was noticed after getting my car back. Brought my car to Autonation Mitsubishi again on 9/4/19.  Replacing the oil drain plug with a larger plug was discussed because the existing drain plug was stripped, but, instead, the threads on the current plug were tapped and rethreaded. My car was returned to me after only a few minutes runtime.  It's leaking more oil now than before!!  Since Autonation Mitsubishi will shutdown this month, I'm concerned that they will not properly repair my car!!  They don't deserve the 5 stars that I gave them several years ago when they actually cared about fixing my car!!",1.8
1,"July 19, 2019","Do NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THESE PEOPLE.. THEY ARE LIARS, CHEATS AND RIP OFF CON ARTISTS.. I had the misfortune of my vehicle going to these frauds and con artists after hurricane Harvey flooded my vehicle..  they had my vehicle for several weeks, and kept messing up calling then tellng me there was another fault and to come back.. this occurred several times.. I was lied to several times, given so many different excuses, and made to be an idiot when they were made idiots of when trying to treat me like a child - I am 63 years old.  The motor is not right, very heavy on gas and has a miss  the transmission has left me stranded more than a few times amongst other things,  a narrow band on the hood has the clear coat paint peeling off and the gas tank does not fill up..  
Recently  after a bad review, the GM, Mr Love contacted me and asked me to bring my vehicle in so that they could repair and see to the issues above.  HOWEVER, the Services Manager, Robert Jenkins acted and behaved as if he was the GM, and failed to accept or follow anything the GM Mr. Love had told me.Once AGAIN I was lied to by Jenkins, who claimed there was nothing wrong with the motor, even though you could see, hear and feel the motor had a miss, they could not get the transmission to keep kicking back gears while driving, or get the emergency mode to activate, that kicks the transmission to 2nd gear and holds it there till the onboard computer is reset  this AT 65 AND 70 mph OR accelerating to get onto a freeway..  also an oil leak on the transmission was supposedly fixed..  IT HAS NOT  THE OIL LEAK IS STILL PRESENT QND 2 DIFFERENT AUTO SHOPS HAVE SAID THE SEAL IS OLD AND DOES NOT LOOK LIKE IT HAS BEEN RRPLACED..  The gas tank light comes on when it is near empty but will only take 16 gallons with coaxing, NOT 18 PLUS GALLONS AS IT SHOULD. The vehicle now only gets at most 200 miles to a tank of gas..  it is a Mitsubishi Raider, 2 wheel drive V6 3.7 ltr. Tell me that is acceptable..  
The motor is really heavy on gas, and is a supposedly rebuilt motor  NOT WHAT I WAS TOLD INITIALLY.. THE TRANSMISSION DID NOT HAVE ANY ISSUES BEFORE THIS LOT GOT HOLD OF IT, AND NEITHER WERE THERE ISSUES WITH THE GAS TANK AS THERE ARE NOW.. THE claim that the peeling clear coat just on a narrow band is from a poor previous paint job has been disputed by several reputable body shops looking at it. Their view is that a spray mist came into contact with the hood amd is why it is just in a small narrow band and not the whole hood. 
So I still have major issues with my vehicle caused by these people and who have lied, made false claims and failed to do what was required and ripped me off $7800. DO NOT BELIEVE THESE PEOPLE OR DO BUSINESS WITH THEM, YOU WILL REGRET IT. .THEY ARE LIARS AND CONS. I have photo proof of the above, INCLUDING where THEY RESET THE ODOMETER WITH A FULL GAS TANK AND THE MILEAGE WHEN IT IS WAS AT 3/4 AND 1/4.  BARELY 12 miles per gallon highway driving at 65 -70 mph.

3,"March 06, 2017","The worst car purchasing experience ever. The salesmen were rude even laughed on the phone when I asked to speak to GM directly. You'll never get the right person on the phone. My mother was in and out the hospital last month due to ovarian cancer. They were not considerate, honest, and professional. They refuse to allow my attorney to review the contract before we sign. They don't honor the pricing they give outside and it changed on the paper. All I've driven is Mitsubishi for 14 yrs but after this experience, never again. From the rude call from Franklin after 8:30pm made about his review to Lonzo who laughed on the phone when I asked for corporate's number. He said is private. To the GM who is never available. To Earl who makes promises he can't keep. Don't go here.  ",1.0
4,"December 13, 2016","Last month, I went with a friend to help him find a vehicle. We had a great sales person, Guadalupe and the first day was a pleasant experience, they took his down payment after showing him and agreeing on a vehicle
 and told him to come back in the morning because it was late to complete all the paper work
 Next day, my friend went and was told that the vehicle that was approved the night before was no longer approved and he had to find another vehicle. He waited for hours to let him know his approval limit so he could purchase the vehicle, which was understandable since he didnt have any credit. He returned home with no vehicle and the salesman told him that he would pick him up the next day because my friend had no transportation to go the following day to continue with process. The next day, he waited from morning to almost 5pm to be picked up but he was called and informed that they were still working with financing. The following day, we returned to dealership and were informed that my friend could be approved for a super expensive truck, and overpriced. He had to pay over 700/mo for a 2011 truck. It seemed that they didnt want to loose the sale and was willing to give him any vehicle as long as was expensive and with high monthly payments. My friend was not convinced of vehicle and refused to continue with sale, & requested his down payment back. At this point, they told him that they couldn't give him his money back because it went over to corporate and due to holidays it would take several days to be processed and refunded. They were so fast to take his money but so hard to refund the money back
 Up to this day, they still have not pay him back his full amount that he paid as a down payment and they keep on giving him the round around. My friend lost almost a week of work trying to purchase a vehicle for his transportation. Gosh! Worst experience ever!!!",1.0
5,"November 29, 2016","
I have been  at home recovering from surgery so I have had time to do my research.  I knew what I wanted,  fair market prices etc.  We found the car online we liked and took it for a test drive.  I told the salesman it was priced above the upper end of fair market (it was priced $9700 and I knew   Fair Market retail was between $8000-$9400) and I said if they would get it down to the lower end of Fair Market ($8000), and I could get checked by an independent mechanic I would buy it on the spot.  

Typical form, salesman had to get the manager who came and told me I was unreasonable for asking for 20% off of the price.  Went further to ""explain"" to me if it were a $100K car I would be asking him to take $20K off.  I'm an accountant so I could do the math, but to be fair he had no way of knowing that.  Manager told me they could sell the car for $9350.  I asked them to email me the official offer and I said I would think about it and get back to the salesman in 48 hours.

Looking over the official bid I notices the price listed under sales tax didn't calculate to 6.25%.  I asked about it and was told that was VIT.  It wasn't much money, so I didn't worry about it.

48 Hours later my phone rings and it's the salesman asking if I've thought about their offer.  I told him I had been thinking and I'd probably be willing to take it for my original offer (thinking I would mention the VIT issue in the closing process).  Within a few minutes my wife got a call (on my phone) from the sales manager saying something like they were willing to come down to our original price so what was the problem.  This struck me as odd so I looked the vehicle up online and it was listed online BELOW what I said my price was ($7500).  So it seems that I was getting called because my price was now $500 below what they had it listed (i.e. if they could get me to buy it without looking online I would pay $500 over the online listing price).  This is kinda cheeky, but can't completely blame them for that.  

I said I'd pay the asking price online, and then started working on details of getting the car to me.  Since I can't drive (i.e. recovering from surgery) the salesman said he'd be willing to drive it to me.  I asked if they could drive it to me and I get it checked by a mechanic.  Understandably they said they wouldn't be willing to do that if I hadn't bought the car. I knew they had a 3 days, no questions asked return policy, and I asked if my situation would fall under that.  I was told yes...so that was good.  This was all on Saturday and I couldn't get the money wired to them, but said I would do so on Monday.  

After getting all of this sorted out, the salesman called me back with another bit of information  (in my view typical ploy).  I w  for me, but he wanted to make sure I couldn't get them a Cashier's check today (I had already gone to great pains to explain I couldn't).    I explained the I would get the money together and let them know on Monday.  

Then I remembered how the tax seemed to be off because of the ""VIT"".  I had never heard of VIT, and though I'm an accountant with a bit of background in sales tax, I do live overseas and not up on the tax law.  I decide to research.  I discovered that VIT is Vehicle Inventory Tax which is supposed to be paid BY THE DEALER NOT THE CUSTOMER.  It's only .2%, but still I emailed the salesman to explain my concern was not the $16 but the fact this would be included in a calculation of a standard form used by the dealer.  I attached to my email the reference from the Department of Motor Vehicles website as well as the Dealers manual which I found online backing up what I was saying.  I said I was ready to close the deal, but I wanted an answer to this question.Oddly enough I never heard back from them. 

I don't like negotiation games, but understand it's part of the process.  Asking me pay $500 above what a car is listed online is a step beyond that, but maybe could be justified.  The last straw for me was hiding VIT in the sales tax.  I'd say be careful",1.4
6,"September 03, 2016",I recently went into this dealership to look at a used vehicle. The salesman Lupe Garcia was fantastic. The general manager however was not so great. He was very unprofessional. Very bad business ethics. I have a lot more choice words about this general manager but I'll keep those to myself. After coming to an agreement on price and getting a buyers order done I decided to buy the car I went to look at due to Lupe being so great. I left the dealership and went to my bank to get the vehicle financed. I finished all of the paperwork and had the bank fax over the draft form to show the vehicle had been financed. I contacted Lupe to let him know the form was faxed and low and behold the general manager was trying to sell the vehicle I just financed. The draft form was literally sitting on his desk. So technically that vehicle was sold. The general manager sold that car to whoever was sitting there even after I had already financed it. The general manager refused to speak with me over the phone and will not call me back. I will never refer anyone to this dealership after this experience. I've never seen a general manager with such horrible business ethics. ,1.0
7,"November 27, 2015","We financed a 2008 Mercedes Benz S550 from Autonation Mitshubishi on 9/24/15. I signed all the appropriate documentation to have the vehicle titled and registered here in Texas. The temporary tag for the vehicle was about to expire, so we decided to contact the TX DMV to check on the status of the registration. When I spoke with TX DMV on 11/10/15 they stated that they have NOT received any paperwork from the dealer to register the vehicle since its purchase date on 9/24/15. They recommended to file a dealer complaint because I should have received my plate and registration a long time ago. The registration and plates can be received by the owner within one day so why have we not received anything in over 2 months?!?

Frustrated, my husband and I contacted the office numerous times and spoke to the Sales Manager Steve, Erica who manages registration of the vehicles that are purchased there and even the General Manager Tracy who all stated they would make sure we received our registration and plates for the vehicle immediately and apologized for the delay. ALL OF THEM LIED TO US! As of 11/27/15 we have yet to receive the registration and plates for the vehicle or any correspondence from them about the continued delay.

This company is absolutely atrocious and they are a bunch of thieves!!!! How dare you sale a vehicle to a customer, receive payment for the purchase and then do not submit any information for the owner to drive the vehicle legally? This business should be closed for false advertisement. I am making payments on a vehicle that I cannot legally drive because of these incompetent, nonchalant managers who don't care about the customer only about receiving money for the sale. 

I will never purchase a vehicle or refer any one to these thieves and promise to post a review on every website I can to help other unsuspecting customers from purchasing a vehicle from them!!!",1.3

9,"November 30, 2014",I was referred by my friend to Autonation Mitsubishi because he had a very good experience shopping for his vehicle. He said to ask for Cesar Zapata.I decided to call to the dealer before going up there  because I was looking for a specific vehicle and I wanted to see if they would have it after speaking with Cesar he assured me that they had I was looking for.I made a appointment to visit the dealer that same day when I showed up Cesar had the vehicle ready for me to test drive. after driving it I knew that I wanted it .Cesar made my buying expiriance a great one I had bought cars before at other dealers and it always took all day not at Autonation Mitsubishi I was out of there in 3 Hours . They have a very large selection of vehicles as well I was very impressed with all the cars they has in their lot they have different makes and models .Thanks Cesar I will send you some friends and family that are looking for a vehicle. ,5.0
10,"May 30, 2014","I worked with Sam R. (unsure of his full last name), at this delaership and I must say that he was an impeccable salesman. I never once felt at if he was trying to get over on me or force me into the purchase. In the end, I left with a 07 Benz, in my name, with a mere $1000 down payment! Im a 20 y.o college student so this was truly amazing! I will and have already reccomended Sam to so many family and friends. He will get he job done!",5.0

12,"June 15, 2013","Searched on internet and dealership responded very quickly.  The internet salesman followed thru quickly with my request and provided me with all options as asked thru e-mails. Made an appointment and visited the dealership. Everyone was real friendly.  The experience was very pleasant and with ""no pressure"" answered my questions and made my car buying experience very enjoyable. He provided information on ea model I had taken interest in and he really left it up to me to make my own decision without the pressure on any choice I was interested in. I  had a Mitsusbishi that I was replacing with a ""new"" one and my extreme happiness with this make, was a no question of the make of car that I would purchase. The only negative issue I have - the car was not ready for pick-up the day I was told.  I had leather interior and tinted windows applied to the car.  I had signed the papers on Thurs., 6/13 and as of this date, 6/18, I'm still waiting.  The salesman had said it would be ready on the 17th - (No) then I was told it would be ready on the 18th - (No).  Now I am told the 19th.  I was only called the 1 time to say that it was going to be delayed until the 17th.  I did call to check on the progess. When I went to pick up my car on the 18th, no one seemed to know anything about my car.  They mentioned that the salesman was out.  Hopefully the car will be ready for pickup on the 19th.",5.0
13,"May 31, 2013","I recently got into a wreck so I was in need of a car. This is my first car from a dealership and I have to say I am in love with it. They have great friendly, fast service. They take the time to listen and find just the right car for you. I am a full time student with a part time job, they worked with me on just the right payments and what was just right for my budget. They offered snacks and coffee, we were in and out in no time. I overall had a great experience there !!!!! I have an 07 Toyota Camry and my salesman was Keith Marcion, he was wonderful.

15,"May 09, 2013","When I went to test drive Mitsubishi Lancer car for my son, I was greeted by Lupe Garcia who was very courteous , professional & such a gentleman. I asked him to come with me in the test drive since i'm not familiar with the area, which he did. During the test drive, he did not try to be pushy with the sale., which is something I appreciated. He was just showing me where to go and that was it. Then, after the Test Drive, I showed my interest in purchasing the car and and explained to him my budget and how much I can pay in cash, he then let me talk to his supervisor Earl Al Phonse who was another real gentleman, who was very courteous and decent and he did approve to the amount my budget can allow with a happy heart. Tell me where else you can find such a service and such understanding.

What killed me most, is when I have taken the car to my mechanic to check it out before I make the final decision to purchase it, it took me over 4 hours to do that. What killed me with kindness, is that I didn't get a rush phone call from Lupe Garcia. I thought he wouldn't be happy that I have taken it for over 4 hours. But he wasn't. He even told me that if for some reason I couldn't have it checked out on the same day, he would be happy to let the car with me for next day to check it out by my Mechanic...unbelievable excellent service!!! Lupe said that he will have the car a detail wash and filling it out gas ready for me to pick it up. Thank you so much Lupe and Earl for being such a courteous and professional gentlemen. You made my son and I really very happy!!

I had no hope left. Fernando call me several times telling me they work with second chance finance. He was very cordial on the phone, and after several attempts, I decided to give him a chance.

19,"March 10, 2013","Last summer I went to AutoNation Mitsubishi to buy a used BMW 335i. It was a beautiful car, in excellent condition and the buying process was as smooth and quick as possible. I was out of there with my car in just over an hour.

21,"February 26, 2013","What a wonderful place from which to purchase a car!   From the beginning to the end of my purchase experience, the sales staff at Champion Mitsubishi Gulf Freeway was very professional, conscientious of my needs & budget, courteous of my time, and treated me with respect.  My salesman, Lupe Garcia, worked very hard to find the right vehicle for my family and we did just that!  He also ensured my vehicle was in perfect condition when I took delivery.  The finance manager, Gill Greer, explained all my options and I felt I had all the information I needed to make the right decisions without any pressure.

22,"July 19, 2012","I requested an INTERNET quote on an Outlander Sport. I wanted a specific package and color. Mr. Van Damm, the INTERNET Manager, responded promptly and gave me a quote, no hassles. I eventually made an appointment. He was there waiting for me and my companion. He showed me the cars in stock and made a few helpful recomendations. He was a nice guy, easy-going and laid back. Price negotiation took a little while but was for the most part stress free. It was a pleasant experience dealing with Mr. Van Damm. He got me a fair deal for the car I wanted and also my old trade in car. We did have to wait for the car to be cleaned, this is one thing they probably can improve. The finance lady Teresa was also easy to work with. I really can recommend these guys to anyone looking to buy or finance or lease a new car. Make sure to talk to Mr. Van Damm the INTERNET Manger.",5.0
23,"May 02, 2012","I bought my new 2012 Mitsubishi Outlander two weeks ago from Lee Van Damm, the Internet Sales Manager at Champion Mitsubishi. BTW their current address is 7200 Gulf Fwy, not 13800 which is the Champion Chevy dealership.  I did my research on Edmunds.com and requested quotes from Champion, so Lee responded. We spoke on the phone and then I visited him a Friday morning. He was friendly in a sincere way, not in a fake or phony way. I test-drove an Outlander off the lot and Lee gave me some useful pointers. When I decided to buy, he gave me a price better than the Edmunds price and he also gave me the financial incentives then available. He was just easy to deal with, and my worries of falling into traps soon vanished. There was a lot of waiting (2 hours) while docs were being prepared; I wish the wait had been shorter. But Lee made my experience shopping for my new car a positive one - and he made it better by giving me a fair trade-in price for my old vehicle.

If you live in Houston and want to buy a Mitsubishi or a used car, give Lee a try. Yes, I'm a real customer, and I'm not affiliated with Mitsubishi, Champion/Auto Nation, or any of their employees or contractors in any way.",5.0
24,"March 01, 2012","I do not recommend you visit this dealership, as you cannot trust them on a used car.  My purchase was negotiated over the internet. I can say that my dealings with the internet sales manager were fine.  During the test drive I was reminded that all vehicles sold on the lot had undergone a 50-point inspection.  After test driving the vehicle, I noticed some yellow sealant around the frame of the driver's door. I asked about this, and the salesman said that it had been used to fix a leak. To no one's fault but mine, I trusted the salesman. 

My car was purchased as-is, with a three-day return policy. On the third day I was about 250 miles away when my ""check gas cap"" dash light came on. I checked the cap, which seemed fine, and then looked in the owner's manual. It said that this was likely caused by a faulty cap and that replacing the cap should fix the problem. And, the ""check engine"" light should come on after a few driving cycles. Well, it did come on and I took the vehicle into my mechanic as I wasn't back in town until the fifth day after I bought the car. The mechanic replaced the cap and the light went off, and all seemed fine. On the sixth day, Houston received up to six inches of rain. That sealant I was told that had fixed the leak? It didn't. So when I walked out to my car, the interior driver's seat and floorboard were soaked, as rainwater had been dripping through the ""fixed"" door frame damage. It took it to a body shop and was quoted anywhere from $345 to replace the seal and remove the unsightly old sealant, to $1100 to fully fix all issues related to the leak. About five days after the gas cap light had gone off, the light came on again, subsequently followed by the ""check engine"" light. I took the car back to my mechanic who discovered that some sort of gas vapor recovery valve had broken off and was causing the ""check gas cap"" light to come one once the sensor finally activated. The worst part was that my mechanic was apologizing for not seeing this earlier. He had placed the new gas cap on and since it caused the gauge light to go off, he didn't not investigate further. However, he said that had he got on his hands and knees and looked under the car he would have saw the broken sensor dangling by a wire. The mechanic stated that the previous driver had hit something in the road that flew up and caused the sensor to get snapped off, as there was a dent under the wheel well. And two days later, my battery was dead. And no, I didn't leave lights on or anything like that. And when a group of us went out to eat, I found out that one of the doors in the back cannot be opened from the inside as the handle linkage is broken. This had all occurred within one month of purchasing the vehicle, so who knows what problems I have yet to find or experience. So back to the dealership. Remember, they had put this car through a ""50 point inspection"". Yet somehow no one ever looked under the car. Or checked the battery. Or tried to see if their repair of the leak actually kept the water out. I had conversed with the online salesman after I found the water leak, and his response was they the dealership would only charge $40/hr to fix it, where most shops would charge over $100. Sounded like a good deal, but then I realized they would just take longer to do it in order to make more money. No offer of ""oh wow, we missed that, bring it in and we'll make it right"" was offered. So, despite the good deal I received, I spent just under another $1000 in required repairs. Unfortunately for the dealership they didn't look through the owners manual to see the small note that the previous owner had forgot to remove, complete with the owner's name and telephone number. So, I was able to get the whole background on this car, including information the dealer did not disclose. I will at least have some legal recourse now. Again, I recommend you do not trust this dealership, at least--from my experience--for used cars. If you found a good deal at their location, read this review, and then had a change of heart, please let them know why you won't be purchasing their vehicle. I don't want anyone else having to go through what I went through.",3.0

29,"November 29, 2011","CJ (Chris) Duncan did an outstanding job locating the right vehicle for me!  The right truck at the right price.  I had been to other dealerships looking for my next purchase, and needed a truck ASAP (I had finally driven my old ride to its death).  CJ was very professional, understood what my bottom line was, and then located the perfect vehicle that was within my budget.  He showed me several vehicles, each time narrowing down what I wanted, rather than trying to sell me something that was on the lot.  And he did all this while I was at work! CJ understood the value of my time. I recommend him to everyone I meet now, when I get a compliment and inquiry about my new truck.  Thanks, CJ.",5.0
30,"November 28, 2011","I would like to start by saying, not only would I recommend someone to Champion, I have and I just bought my car from them about a month ago. My salesman (Christopher Duncan) must have shown me ten different vehicles before my wife and I finally made a choice. There wasn't any pressure to buy or trying to force me into something I didn't like... just patience, understanding, and professionalism. I must say, at first I was just window shopping, but ultimately Christopher said he could put me in a vehicle that day, and he delivered. I was in and out of financing in about 15 minutes, and plan on buying my next vehicle there as well. Thanks again Chris, love the Jeep!",5.0
31,"November 28, 2011","Came into Champion Mitsubishi after doing some research on the internet.  CJ Duncan was professional, and didn't try to pressure me into a sale.  He took the time to find out what I wanted in a car.  Even though I didn't buy on my first visit, when I come back, I only want to deal with him.  ",5.0

33,"September 22, 2011","Right from the start I already knew we were going to be in great hands as soon as C.J. Duncan greeted us at the door and initiated a conversation.  Rather than the usual ""What brings you in today"" routine C.J. politely made compliments of my skill to interpret in ASL (American Sign Language) to my partner.  Then after holding a conversation of interest for about 10 minutes then our salesman started talking business.  I can not be more precise when saying this ""NOW THAT IS HOW U EARN A CUSTOMER"" A solid ice breaker and then follow with business talk!  If anyone wants to learn how to become a better salesman, take some pointers from C.J. Duncan.  

We both (my partner) and I didn't feel like a walking dollar sign as soon as he greeted us but rather like close friends, and after a while I myself no longer saw him as a salesman but more so a friend who was helping us.  Over all the experience was exquisite!  From start to finish it was a smooth process and within a matter of 24 hrs, we got the vehicle we had our eyes set on.  Now usually I don't really do ratings and or surveys, but when you get customer service that by far surpasses your expectations you just have to give credit where it is due.  

We most definitely will be recommending all of our friends and family to C.J. at the Champion Mitsubishi dealership, and I for one will be coming back VERY soon to purchase a car for myself!",5.0
