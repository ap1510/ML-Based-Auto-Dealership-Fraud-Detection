0,"May 20, 2019","Making large purchases is scary to me! It was time for our family to purchase another vehicle and we had a certain price range which meant we were getting a pre-owned car. I spent days on car buying apps finding ‚Äúgreat deals‚Äù. But when it checked into the seller information I was less than assured that I would be dealing with someone trustworthy. I decided to go to Gilman Nissan because of a friend‚Äôs recommendation. I felt that purchasing a used car at a new car dealership was a wiser decision for us. As I walked into the door I was greeted by sales person Suman Kumar. Within a few minutes, after evaluating what I was looking for, he showed me the car I ended up purchasing that day. For the record, on the car buying app it was listed as a ‚Äúgood deal‚Äù. Buying a used car is risky business but it is all our family can afford. We found a car we love and spending time with Kumar and Roger Jimenez, the Finance Manager, gave me peace of mind that we have a good car with very little risk! Thank you Kumar and Roger!",5.0
1,"May 03, 2019","I bought a used car from this dealer in January 2019, I paid for the car and told them to clean the car and I will come tomorrow to pick it up, I went there the next day the car was not clean I brought the car home and found a birthday card and a tax return with all the information of the previous owner and the drivers manual of Ford Explorer while my car was Toyota, that shows how responsible they are.  After a thousand mile of driving the oil change light came up, while it supposed to go for 5000 miles. 
I purchased gap insurance with this car the next day when I celled my insurance company to add the car, my insurance company sold me the gap insurance at a much lower price, I called the dealer to cancel the gap insurance in January, it is May and it is still not done, I went to the dealership twice, called tens of times, left messages, I always get the reply that they are doing it and will be done today. I am very frustated, ",2.2

6,"January 19, 2018","I live out of town. It‚Äôs a 3 hour drive. I found a certified preowned (CPO) Nissan online and arranged a trip to drive, and hopefully buy the vehicle. We had already discussed the drive out price. I made the trip, then the price suddenly changed, and I had to haggle for 45 minutes just to get the originally agreed upon price again. !BAD BUSINESS! Strike one. Then there was a broken sunglass holder in the truck that was strategically placed so customers wouldn‚Äôt notice. I found it on the test drive and was told they‚Äôd have the service department repair it. Then later was told they wouldn‚Äôt because I wouldn‚Äôt pay one of the bogus fees they tried to tack on to our originally agreed upon price. It‚Äôs a $260+ part I‚Äôd have to fix. !BAD BUSINESS! Strike two. Now we‚Äôre over 3 hours in, they bring me the keys and there is no keyless entry fob. ‚ÄúOh no sir, this truck doesn‚Äôt have that feature.‚Äù I pull up the ad on their own webpage, it‚Äôs actually a ‚Äúhighlighted feature!‚Äù It‚Äôs also a lie. !BAD BUSINESS! Strike three. I end up getting my down-payment back and walking on the deal. They tried to sell me another CPO truck, but the tires were almost bald and it wouldn‚Äôt start, dead battery. So much for that 167 point CPO inspection! Do not trust these scammers. Their word is no good. This business tarnishes the Nissan brand.",1.8

-If I could mark a ZERO for this place I would... Just like the employees that work there!
All zero's!!!!!!!
Gillman Nissan is probally the Greediest dealership I have been to in my life. 
Bought a car 1 mth ago. I paid half down in cash and just paid the first car payment for the balance. Tire light keeps coming on went to discount and the thread is a 4/32 
I UNDERSTAND its recommendation is to change out . But my question is how is a car that's only 4 months old when I bought it a 2016 with only 5,000 miles need new tires already. Less than 1 month owned. 
We had a bad first impression of this place and was there for literally 8 hours negotiations the price on a certified car... 
When I go back to question what was the thread at inspection time - NO ONE has record of it. Then 30 min later come to find a record of it! It was just found!!!!!Then The GM Mark comes out and basically says Nissan will not replace the tire. I wasent asking for all 4 tires but the one that was a 3 1/2 to a 4 be replaced . Seriously, it's NOT about the $ it's the principal 
How do you sell a car with the tire thread at a supposedly 5/32
Not to mention the sales manager and I went out to measure the thread and both agreed on the tire thread measurements. ONLY one was a 7/32
Then the Service manager boss comes out and measures quickly and comes up with totally different measurements. So his service manager can not measure correctly / is he not capable - he's the manager? 
Lmao!! Come on who you fooling Nissan üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
Nothing but LiARS 
Point is from the start we were told this car was not in a wreck and came to find out it was. Then the GM said it was bought at auction.. Ugh hello the sales guy said some lady traded it in? 
Point is ALL LIES!!!! And they got caught in all of them
To fight over a $80.00 tire they rather xxxx a customer off. Instead of replacing it! Then when I mention to the GM I will write a review - he says he feels threatened. Really.. Because A customer advises you of what is about to go on social media and that he can be aware of others knowing of their wrongdoings. That's NOT A THREAT xxxxxxx 
It's called communication re: your establishment to others who work hard for their money. And don't want anyone else to get jacked 
Well, I have a big mouth and everyone will know not to go there! They will eventually close those doors.. From sales to service to management A ZERO is what the get!!!
Karma is a xxxxx!!!!

13,"June 28, 2015","The service department is just terrible. On July 16th, 2014, I reported a damaged part on one door. Steven Mathews told me that warranty would cover it but the part had to be ordered because it wasn't in stock. He also told me the would call me when the part arrives. Almost a year later I am still waiting for that call. I have been at the dealer several times during this period to ask about the part and have always received the same answer: ""it hasn't arrived yet"". I received a notification by mail that the part was ordered, so I cannot believe it takes a year for this part to be built or shipped. 

In other occasion I had an appointment for the regular maintenance service. When I arrived system was down, waited an hour and reschedule for the next day. The next day when I arrived system was still down. I reschedule to the next day and Mr. Mathews Told me he would call me if problem persisted. I did't received the call, so I went to the dealer. System was still down.

If you want headaches, please do you car services at Gillman Nissan at Rosenberg.",1.8
14,"June 12, 2015","Although initially pleasant to deal with, the salesman misinformed me on the purchase of my 2015 Nissan Rogue.  I was told that the car had a feature I wanted but when the car arrived, it did not.  I did not notice it immediately but I did within 24 hours of having the car.  Although willing to accept responsibility, the dealership was completely unwilling to do anything to make the situation right for me.  I am beyond disappointed and would not recommend doing business with them.  ",2.0

18,"March 03, 2014","After working with various internet sales managers, we selected Gillman Nissan of Rosenberg, TX to make our purchase of a 2014 Rouge about two weeks ago. Their price was good, and their intent saleswoman was responsive.

Upon arriving at the dealership, a salesman was assigned to lead us through our purchase. As a first step, the salesman insisted that we do a test drive in the actual car that we were going to drive home. Having completed a test drive already, I was reluctant, but my wife insisted that we complete another drive. The salesman and I entered the car, and he proceeded to explain various features on the vehicle. After driving for a few minutes, we returned and I asked the salesman to clean the car while we completed the paperwork.

After completing the financing paperwork, we met our salesman again, who assured us that he had cleaned the car and parked it outside with a full tank of gas. He explained that he had checked everything on the car and that we were good to go. The dealership supposedly did not owe us any additional add-ons or accessories. We signed the final checkout form and went outside to what we thought was the same vehicle I drove earlier.

As my wife sat in the driver's seat and the salesman explained more details about the car to her, I went to take my son to the car in which we had arrived. It was then that I noticed the same car that I drove earlier. My suspicions were raised immediately, and I couldn't believe that the saleman would have so blatantly lied to us. I was confused as to why he would be trying to give us a different vehicle than the one I drove earlier. Moreover, I really doubted myself because I didn't remember any specific detail about the car I drove other than how badly I parked it. I began to walk back and forth between the two cars to compare them, and while the trim was the same, I eventually noticed that several of the dealer add-ons that we had paid for were not on the car that my wife was sitting in. I couldn't believe that we were about to be victims of a bait and switch. I was in utter disbelief. I asked to see the salesman's manager immediately.

As it turns out, of the $721 worth of add-ons that we had paid for, only the $47 wheel locks were on the car that we were about to drive home. The GM fumbled through various excuses before eventually accusing the salesman of wrongdoing. Had I not seen the salesman go into the GM's office for every single decision that had to be made, I might have believed him.

Even though the dealership did provide the add-ons after I complained, I would highly encourage anyone to avoid buying a vehicle at Gillman Nissan of Rosenberg. Our purchase there was a terrible experience, and I would not trust anything that they tell you.",2.0
19,"December 06, 2013","I started my car search using TrueCar and other internet options. I had a member of the Gillam team contact me thru TrueCar.  I replied by E-mail thanking them for the response, but explained I was looking for a very specific vehicle, and it was not in their inventory listed online. The individual replied asking what vehicle I was looking for and I replied the Blue 2014 Nissan Xterra Pro-4X. Below is the text of the conversation back and forth from that point:

Gillam: I talked to my manager and we have that Xterra available.

Me:I don't mean to seem untrusting, but I had another dealership tell me they had it on the lot yesterday.  I drove there last night to find out they didn't have any 2014 Pro-4X's on the lot, nor did they have any there when I was told it was available.  So now I am a little skeptical.  Can you verify that the vehicle is definitely there and if I come tonight I will be able to look at it, with the understanding that it could always be sold between now and then. 

Gillam: The xterra is available , When can you come in the dealership?

When I arrived that night, after leaving work early from Webster Texas and picking up my wife, I was greeted at the door by two members of the sales team.  I asked for the individual I had exchanged E-mails with.  Upon their return, they told me she had explained what I was looking for and they did not have that vehicle on the lot. To say I was less than pleased would be an understatement. After expressing my displeasure, the salesmen went to get the sales manager. While the manager seemed like a nice enough person, he seemed to want to make excuses rather than just admit what happened.  He assured me there was no attempt to deceive me. I will let the readers of this determine if hey feel that is true.  The text above is a cut and paste from my E-mail. He then went on to try and educate me on what the term available means. Since I didn't have my phone with me, I wasn't able to get the E-mail and review it at the time. But, when I put his definition together with the E-mail, it makes me believe more and more that, not only was I intentionally deceived, but that the employees are taught to do it this way. I agreed to look at the car they had, but stated I was not saying I would still do business with them. The salesman who should me the car, Hassan, was a polite gentlemen and at no time seemed to be anything but professional. If not for him, the rating would probably be a 1. I did agree to call the next day and let them know what I decided on whether I would do business with them. My intent was to wait until late afternoon to see if I got an E-mail from the individual who mislead me. Instead, Hasan follwed up with me at 12:24 via a phone call.  I explained to him I had decided against doing business with them. I hated to do it to what seemed like a nice person, but cannot be part of the problem by rewarding the delearship for misleading me. If they can't even be honest on what vehicle is there when I reach out to me, what else would they deceive me on?",2.3
20,"October 10, 2013","Nice dealership. Good inventory. Drove 5 hours to pick up a truck purchased over the phone on the contingency that all imperfections were verbalized or photographed and sent via email. When we arrived, we found the side view mirror damaged and needing to be replaced and it was definitely a smoker's vehicle with burnt holes and discoloring above the driver's window as well as the signature smell of a smoker's vehicle. Normally, these problems would be acceptable and even expected for an older vehicle but it's bothersome nonetheless that they weren't addressed before driving the distance. The price was desirable so we went ahead with the purchase. It was a great chance for someone to break the stereotypical ""used car salesman"" mold but it just wasn't in the cards. I wish the best of luck in their future car sales and hope that this post doesn't hinder sales but I just want to be honest with anyone else looking for a used car. Good luck!",3.0
21,"May 31, 2013","In, March/April 2006, I bought my first Nissan Titian Crew cab pickup truck.  I bought it new from Gillman Nissan Ft. Bend, in Rosenberg TX.  Since then I have been extremely happy with it ride, it durability and reliability. Over the past seven years I have racked up 149K (+/-). I was so impressed with the Titian; I was planning to go back Gillman Nissan to buy a 2013 crossover. At least, until Monday May 06, 2013 when I took the Titian to the Gillman Nissan Ft. Bend‚Äôs Service Center for what I thought could have been a major problem(s).

The symptoms were, (1) the oil pressure gage was pegged out on High. (2) It was hard to start. And (3) there was a fairly large amount of white smoke coming from the exhaust for about 3 or 4 minutes after starting. It wasn‚Äôt running rough, missing out, no hesitation, and no overheating, no nothing, just these three symptoms. However, since it has 149K, I thought it could be a major problem(s).  However, I wasn‚Äôt expecting the diagnosis to come back that the engine is blown and needs to be replacing. The estimate for a used engine would be $4,500 and $11K for a new replacement engine.

 They said diagnosis test indicated bad compression, slug all throughout the engine, bad injectors etc.  When I questioned the diagnosis, the Service Adviser told me that the Titian 5.6 engine was bad about going out around 148 -150k. I was expecting bad news, but this bad.  I walked out of the service center with a written estimate, and $105 non-refundable diagnosis charge. Got in my poor old broken down truck and drove 35 miles home and parked in the driveway.

When I got to work the next morning (via my motorcycle) I was told by a co-worker whos husband, is a technician for another dealership in the area. He had told her that over the last few days his dealership service dept. was experiencing, an unusually large number of vehicles coming into their shop with diesel mixed in with the vehicles‚Äô gasoline.  Turns out, they all bought bad gasoline from a service station in my home town, the same gas station I bought 18 gallons of gas from just 4 days earlier. That was the same day I started having starting problems.  The next morning I added 16 gal of clean gas to my Titians‚Äô fuel tank. Immediately the starting problem improved and the smoking issue was reduced significantly.  I then made 170 miles trip on, according to the Gillman Service Dept., a blown engine without any problems. 

Along the way I found a Jiffy Lube. I had the oil level checked and then change. According to the lead mechanic changing the oil the dip stick indicated that the crank case was over filled with about 1 to 1 ¬Ω quarts of oil. Thus the pressure gage is reading correctly, showing high pressure.  Problem # 1 solved. I have now corrected all three issues with my Titian with a $40 oil change and $70 worth of gas, for a grand total of $110. This is after two days and 210 miles of highway driving on an engine that Gillman Nissan Diagnosis test revealed as blown an engine.

You would think I am a happy camper now. Well I am not.  I came within a Nat‚Äôs eye lash from spending a lot of money unnecessarily with Gillman Nissan because of their Diagnosis test analyses. 

I went back to the Gillman Service Department and confronted the Service manager and the Service Advisor about their Diagnosis test. The Service Manager (SM) and the Advisor reviewed the diagnosis test results with me again. The SM stated they had done a computer check and found some indications of the loose of compression in the cylinders.  I asked if they had pulled the dip stick to check the condition and level of the oil. They said that they did and found nothing unusual. I asked if the crankcase had an excess amount of oil would it increase the oil pressure. They said yes.

I asked if they had check for any contaminates fuel tank.  They said they did and didn‚Äôt notice anything unusual.  I asked the Gillman Service Manger if the symptoms of being hard to start and smoking badly could indicate the possibility of a bad gasoline in the fuel system.  He said yes.

I told them about my conversation I had with the manager of the driven gas satiation, who freely admitted that diesel had indeed been pumped into the station underground gasoline tanks accidently. I also related my conversation with the Jiffy Lube lead mechanic. The SM had a concerned look on his face and started making excuses or defending the testing they did.

I then told the SM and SA that I paid for $105 for a non-refundable diagnosis test, so they could tell me what was wrong with my truck. I told them that they‚Äôre diagnosis test has failed to help me and Gillman,  If my doctor used their diagnosis test on me, the doctor would want to do a heart transplant, when all I really needed was to take a baby aspirin once a day. These symptoms could have been repaired real simply. I would have been glade to pay for the work. Not only was the test faulty, but they lied about what they did. They tried real hard to convince/ deceive me. If it hadn‚Äôt been for some good friends and a couple of honest business people they would have been successful. Good business people don‚Äôt have to lie and cheat to make a living. Only the looser have to defraud their customers. The Gillman Nissan Service center committed Attempted Theft by Deception. I can guarantee Gillman Nissan Ft. Bend this; I will never buy nothing from them again and they can be dam sure I won‚Äôt bring anything to them fix.  At least I got my $105 non-refundable diagnosis Fee back. That‚Äôs the only thing they did right!!!!!

22,"March 17, 2013","I was in the market for a 2013 Nissan Maxima 3.5 S model, but soon found myself steering towards the 2012 Nissan Maxima 3.5 SV model.  I found that it had more of the options I wanted to have in my next car.  I found several dealerships who carried this model, but only a few that carried it in the color I wanted, Gillman Nissan of Rosenberg, TX was one of them.  After I confirmed that the car that I was interested was in stock/still available, I made an appointment.  After the test drive, answering all my questions, the dealership and I were able to settle on a price that was a fantastic deal!  Based on my credit score/history, the dealership was able to beat my pre-approved bank loan APR so I decided to finance through them.   The paperwork process was a breeze as the finance director spelled out all the details clearly.   The entire car buying process was a very positive experience and this dealership exceeded my expectations.  Despite being 30 miles from my office and about 40 miles from my home, I plan on bringing my car back for any maintenance, scheduled services or other repairs needed to my car.   I would recommend this dealership to anyone looking to find a great deal on a Nissan.",5.0
23,"March 17, 2013","I had an amazing experience with Gillman Nissian. I am from Louisiana and drove 4 hours to get my car. I had been searching for an Altima for a few weeks. None of the dealerships in LA had the storm blue with tan interior nor did they make any effort to look for it at other dealerships. When I called Gillman after seeing a storm blue car online they informed me that it had black interior, it wasn't exactly what I wanted but for the price I knew it was worth the trip to Rosenberg. A few minutes after out initial conversation, Mr. Pete called me back to inform me that he had found the exact car I had wanted. I knew then I was going to purchase my car from Gillman. They took the extra step to make sure I was getting exactly what I wanted when no other dealership I had spoken to had. I'm definitely going to recommend Gillman Nissan to everyone her in LA.  ",5.0

25,"May 27, 2012","I live across town and I was not even looking to get a car in Rosenburg, but I hit the wrong button and my search request was sent to Mr Ross. He called me immediately, within minutes and with his customer service and humorous nature over the phone I decided I was willing to drive almost forty miles to his dealership. It was worth the distance. 

Although it took a long time for the financing to go through, mostly because of cell phone issues, Mr Ross never made us feel pressured.  Mr Ross was so nice. My pregnant wife and I drank over a eight bottles of water waiting for the finance department.

 Every question I asked he answered with a common sense answer that made me feel better about my car buying experience. He was even good enough to tell us what we would be better getting upgrades done after we purchased the vehicle(at best-buy) versus having them include it or have to go up model types(saving us money in the long haul). I am very impressed. I am going to refer ALL my  friends and family to him. 

I want Mr Ross to succeed because he really made us so happy about the decision we were making. There are Two important decisions in everyone's lives  your house and your car and this was a no brainier, thanks to Mr.Ross.

36,"April 02, 2012","I found a Murano that I like on Gillman Nissan on website.  According to the website they have this vehicle in stock but when I came to visit the dealer, believe it or not, they don't have it! One of the sale man took me around and showed me other Murano that has the same internal color that I like and showed me another one that has the external that I want and wanted me to give him an offer to close the deal! He was not happy much because I told him that I would not do that since I did not even see the one that I like.  He then told me that the vehicle that I like was not on the floor, it was in the warehouse and he will be able to get it in if he has some kind of commitment from me! Once again, I told the man that I would not do that, If he wants to earn my business, he needs to have the vehicle in, give his customer a chance to take a look without asking his customer put down some money just to have a chance to take a look at the vehicle that his customer want to see?  I told him that all he had to do is telling me that if he has the vehicle to show me or not, if not I'd leave and look for somebody else who has it.  He got frustrated and ask me to follow him in to his office, I followed him to his office and asked myself what kind of game he wants to play next.  He left and came back with one of his Sale Manager, His name was Hilton Tran, this man really knew how to treat his customer.  Mr. Tran took time explained us everything and told us that he would bring the vehicle in for us to take a look tomorrow without asking me to put down any money. 

Well, the next day I came, the vehicle I like was there, colors and options matched my likings.  Mr. Tran and I made the deal painlessly, I bought my Murano LE loaded with all options with Mr. Tran pleasure and happiness. Everything when good from A to Y, but when the sale man tried to put the temporary license plate on the back of my vehicle, he ""stripped"" one of the screw holes and had the screw stuck in there!!!! I was internally mad as hell, I just paid for one of the most expensive vehicles in his lot and when it came to the last step, he ""F'ed"" it up like that? He used the other one, screwed it in to hold the plate and punched a hole thru the temporary license plate hang it of the screw and told us if we want, My wife and I can take the vehicle drive home like that!!! We just could not believe that was how the man approached and solved the issue like that to his brand new customer.  I asked to talk to his manager, I told the manager that I'd leave my ""just bought"" vehicle behind for them to fix it and would come back to pick up the next day.  

Next day came, I called one of the sale managers in the dealer and was advised that it was fixed and inspected.  We once again had to drive all the way from Galveston, TX to Rosenberg, Texas.  It took us 1.5 hr to get to the dealer, again, Mr. Tran, Hilton greeted us with warm welcome, he showed me my vehicle, but when I saw curious to see how good it was the fixed it, I was very disappointed, the screw hole was not fixed, what they did to it was they inserted a threaded plastic cartridge in the hole, fasten the crew in and hoped it would hold the license plate in place! The dang plastic seated floppily in the hole and with my two fingers I could easily I pulled it out of the hole and showed it to Mr. Tran.  Mr. Tran called in the Service Manager and the Service Manager told us that the right part was not available un till Sat, that was why he had to fix it temporary just because he was out of part! ??? Now, I don't even understand why would the other Manager told me that my vehicle was fixed and inspected when it was not?  I asked Mr. Tran why and was told that He was not aware of the situation.  I'm wondering :""Why didn't they communicate to each other""?  Is this how they treat their customer after the sale?  Well, finally my Murano was fixed on the following Sat.  Mr. Tran offered me a some gas for my trip driving home.

Well, it was a mix feeling of experiencing with Gillman Nissan.  Bad/Good?  I can't tell now, I met good/bad people and had good/bad service in there also.  One thing I know for sure, I will not return to Gillman Nissan for my next vehicle anymore, and I will not recommend it to any of my friend either.  One simple fact is I just don't want any of my friend to go thru all the pain, driving back and forth and very poor service of the dealership that I just went thru. ",2.6

He was the only one that returned with a phone call and off the top of his head made me a deal that was attractive. All the way through the sales process John was considerate, forthcoming, and gave me a strong sense of fairness. He closed the deal with Mr Pham waiting to close the contract. He gave me a loaner vehicle of the same class I bought so they could prep my purchase to be ready when I got off work on Monday.

After the initial visit didn't go so well, my daughter decided to get a quote thru Gillman's Internet Sales and Mr. Ross at that point became our contact person. After several good conversations with him I decided to set up a meeting in person and ended up buying the vehicle at that time, which was last night.

Also, I have already received a ""thank you"" call first thing this morning from him along with offering his help at any time.  Normally in my past experience, once the papers are signed you never hear from the sales person so I really appreciated him taking that extra few minutes out of his time to make the call and would definately recommend customers to Mr. Ross.

We thought he had the car in stock, he said someone had sold it but he would be willing to make us the best deal.  I'd forgotten his name by the time we arrived at the dealership.(48.6 miles)  I asked for the internet contact at the dealership when we arrived.

We'd already had our prices and offers from two other dealerships, trade price from Carmax, and financing options from our bank.

The dealers at these other places did not have any in stock and couldn't forsee when they would be getting any in. They continued to push larger model cars and their used cars. When David Ross answered an quote via e-mail and a follow up telephone call he was straight forward. We told him what we were looking for. To our amazement he came up with the car that we bought at a price that we could live with. It didn't have the frills that most cars come with, which was absolutely perfect for us. It was the car we had been looking for. When we arrived at Gillman Nissan the sales people were friendly and helpful. David was knowledgable and reassured us that although the car wasn't there they had secured it for us. Unfortunately the car didn't arrive for three more days after our purchase. The team at Gillman Nissan called each day with an update on the car, because we were a little disappointed for the late arrival, they tinted the windows at no charge. My daughter was thrilled. The extent of David's customer service really shined through when he came in on his day off to make sure that the car had arrived and the windows were tinted as promised. The whole team at Gillman Nissan made sure that when my husband came to pick up the car that day that he was given the royal treatment. ",5.0

68,"September 10, 2011","Even though I am happy with my purchase I'm not sure I would recommend this dealership to others.  The vehicle we purchased was used, but to our complete disbelief it was never properly inspected!!!  After purchasing the vehicle and driving it for a week it began to overheat and when we checked under the hood a little more found an almost empty radiator, what appeared to be oil in the air filter (it was dripping) and the oil when checked was dirty.  Once I notified Matt of this, and he assured me there was an oil change and initial inspection done on the vehicle, Matt agreed to have the records of said service for me when I brought my car back in for detailing and application of additional services I had purchased.  Two days later Matt called me to ask if I could bring the car in early because when he looked for the service record he could not find it on file, and when he questioned the service manager Matt was told that the vehicle had slipped through the cracks when the dealership split the pre-owned vehicles.  I find it very hard to believe that a vehicle sitting in your inventory for 49 days did not show up on any report or that NO ONE noticed that either you were missing a vehicle on one lot OR that you had not even done an initial inspection to see if you were going to keep the vehicle on the lot.  That being said, Matt put me in a loaner and my car was checked over as it should have been done in the first place.  There were SEVERAL major issues that were repaired that should not have happened on a vehicle sold from a dealership.  I appreciate that given that the work was done over the Labor Day holiday I had my vehicle back in 4 days time, however this was an inconvenience.  Especially because the loaner vehicle had to be returned to have the tail light and rear blinker bulb changed because it was given to me with out them working properly.  I also appreciate the fact that Matt received numerous calls from both my husband and myself regarding the issues we encountered and he was always polite, friendly and helpful.  

Another matter is one of safety regarding your dealership during extremely windy days.  When I brought the loaner car back to have the bulbs replaced I went to leave the dealership through the front doors and was flung across the parking lot when the wind caught the door.  I was not seriously injured but the event was witnessed by at least 3 employees, my husband and another customer.  I was asked by Lori and Matt if I was ok, and was offered to go have myself checked out by medical staff, but I refused as I didn't feel serious damage was done.  However, we were told that several employees had had issues with doors that opened that particular direction and that signs had been put up on other doors stating ""please use other door.""  Why this was not done to the main entrance doors I'm not sure but if I had been a child or elderly individual I would've flown into the car parked less than 3' from where I landed, and would have been more seriously injured.  

I guess in conclusion I would hope that my experience could be used as a learning experience for some of your staff members.  Perhaps a weekly report of what vehicles have been (or have not been) serviced/bought/etc could be done instead of a monthly report so that someone has an idea when a vehicle has sat on a lot for almost two months without being checked over by a certified technician or to have safety measures in place to prevent customers from being injured.

I couldn't how fast the process went....in fact, I had only dropped by after work to get a price/quote on a pick-up truck and ended up purchasing (and coming home with) the truck without my husband's help!  That's how at ease Mr. Peter made me feel as he made sure I understood the sales details and that I felt comfortable with my truck purchase and the various features of the truck.

If all goes well (and I'm sure it will) I'll be a returning customer.

Thanks,

THE best, by far, shopping and buying experience we have ever had.  John Decman was great.  He is not your run-of-the-mill car salesman.  He is intelligent, pleasant and very knowledgeable about Nissan.  Nothing is worse than a pushy car salesman...John is not that.  When I need another vehicle I will definitely check with John Decman at Gillman Nissan.  If he's not there, I will ""hunt him down."" ",5.0

101,"March 25, 2011","I have been going through some really rought times and needed someone to look at me as a individual trying to make a start and not someone in a bind...David Ross from the very beginning was very insistant that he could help if I would just come in. After really bad circumstances with other dealerships I was hesitant and trusted absolutely nobody, David called again, and I finally gave in (as I called it) and came in - what an amazing difference - Yes he wanted to sell a car (he's a salesman) but he listened to why I didnt trust anyone and genuinely cared, I was immediately introduced to several people and treated as if I had alot of money and was important!  By the time this ordeal was over I had a great deal, a great car, an unbeleivable boost in self-confidence and worth... David Ross made me cry - but in a good way, I feel like I mattered, he actually was more concerned with making sure I got the right deal and was happy and confident in what I was doing, more than (like the other guys) just trying to sell a car. I would most definitely recommend this dealership and especially David to anyone, I've never been treated with more compassionately and respected as a person than I was this day - When I left, he gave me hug told me congratulations and said he was glad to finally see me smile - that's when I cried. :) I turned and told him ""Thankyou for helping me take the first step in my new life"" You guys are the best everyone there was extremely nice and trulely care about their customers - Your not Just Salesmen - Your True Men!
Thanks again for everything - Very satisfied and Completely Happy Customer!!!!!!!!

No ""gotcha"" games were involved at any part of the car buying process.  

The finance department even called me the day after we left the dealership to explain they obtained even better financing terms for us, and in a short period of time, the cost of the loan and our monthly payments dropped!  Even though we had already signed contract and financing paperwork the previous day, they told us there was even a better rate!  No other dealership has done this for us before!

I have also had a friendly relationship with Bill Asare and had determined over a year ago that if and when we bought a new Nissan, we would buy it from Gillman Nissan in Rosenberg and would secure Bill's help and expertise in choosing the right automobile for my wife.  He provided just the right balance of information on both the Altima and the Maxima for us to make a decision and a deal.  Pete Harvy was also very proactive in providing a smooth transition from our 2003 Altima and a new Maxima.  (What a car!)  Pete went beyond just the sale by retrieving my CD's from the 2003 when the player malfunctioned.  All in all it was and is a good experirnce and we would do it again.

But, it would have been nice if the salesperson offered more information. After I test drove the car, I decided to buy. While waiting to complete the paperwork, it seemed like the salesperson ""lost"" the keys but after a while found the keys in his pocket. He seemed new, but very nice. He made sure the car was delivered in good condition.

I couldn't pick up my license plates when they arrived so I asked them to mail it, which I appreciated them doing since I lived relatively far away.

I think I got a pretty good deal on the price, although I think I should have gotten more for my trade in. They honored one of those ""no hassle"" deals from my bank.
