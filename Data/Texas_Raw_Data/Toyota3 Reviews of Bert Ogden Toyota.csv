0,"June 22, 2020","I will never come back here!  They convinced me to buy a car that I did not want, I went on December 2019 to buy a CHR and they told me that they could not sell it because supposedly they had a recall, they lied to me and abused of  my good intention, they told me; if you buy this Corolla from us and you keep it for 5 months, you return  and we will trade it in for the CHR you want.  I just went after 5 months and they don't want to keep their word, now I'm stuck with this car.  I bought two cars at this agency but never again!",1.0
1,"September 14, 2018","Traded in my leased vehicle July 21st, didn't get a check for the pay off SENT OUT til 8/30!!!! (The car i no longer drive STILL isn't paid off and its now 9/10).How was I notified??? By my previous financial bank, threatening to report me to the credit bureau. When I followed up on the pay off, I was told it was taken care of. Following week I'm called again for a payment, was then told Toyota had just called for a pay off the day I called to follow up on it! Went in in person, was promised to get some sort of paper work showing proof my old vehicle was paid off and didn't receive anything until the end of the week once I spoke to the general sales manager. What I don't understand is, if my payment was 30 days late, why didn't they over night the check they issued AUGUST 30TH?? Now I pray it DOESN'T affect my credit score cause I'm now 2 payments late. Thanks Bert Ogden Toyota. ",3.0
