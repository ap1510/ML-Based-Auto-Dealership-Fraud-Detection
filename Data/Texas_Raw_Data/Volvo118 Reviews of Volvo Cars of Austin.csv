5,"May 18, 2020","For the last several years, I have bought only Volvo Certified Pre-owned vehicles.  Finding them can sometimes be a challenge...I live in NW Louisiana and I've bought cars from Volvo dealers in Dallas, Houston and now Austin. The negative thing about buying cars is always the games dealerships play - I hate that. I'm happy to say that Volvo Cars of Austin played no games. Dylan Radzavich was a pleasure to deal with. I recommend him whole-heartedly.",5.0
6,"May 14, 2020",This is genuinely the very BEST car dealership in Austin and Dylan Radzavich is a big part of that! I had to replace my car because unfortunately it was totaled from a car accident. I had contacted a few dealerships in the area and scheduled showings to view them but I also had questions about the difference in features as some were 2014 and some were 2016 models right from the get go Dylan was genuinely warm and friendly and answered all my questions with enthusiasm and genuine concern about my wants and needs. I never once felt pressured or pushed; rather Dylan and his manager Brian just wanted to make sure that I felt confident in purchasing this vehicle from them and that this would be a safe and reliable car. Also worth noting was how CLEAN the dealership was which is especially important admist what's going on in the world right now! I don't want to get too much in to speaking ill of other dealerships but this one truly gleams above the rest in everyway! Dylan and his manager Brian and Lee (I believe that was is name) in the finance department are all truly wonderful and kind people and they stand behind the vehicles they sell. It is particularly endearing about a dealership that runs on ethics and golden rule in general and this place absolutely does!!! They deserve so many more stars then just 5 I'd give em a million if I could...,5.0

8,"April 10, 2020","My son found the vehicle he was looking for (pre-owned VW Golf-R) at this dealership. He was able to engage Mr. Frohlich online and got the details he needed, negotiate an acceptable price for the vehicle, the valuation of the trade, and the rate we were willing to accept on the car loan. Then we went to test drive it and make sure we were happy. Total time at the dealership was about 90 minutes.",5.0

10,"February 27, 2020","My experience buying at Volvo of Austin with Emmett was one of the best car buying experiences I've had. We came in with limited knowledge about Volvo but were quickly impressed with the facilities, our sales rep,Volvo's approach to building safe cars and adoption of PHEV technology (a requirement for our buy). Emmett worked with our schedule and our needs and ultimately went went to bat for us to complete the deal. Also, having been to a number of dealerships over the last few months, I was impressed how well he knew their product as compared to other reps at competing brands. We worked off and on throughout the week in a flexible manner ( while not onsite ) to finalize numbers and then came in to finalize it. It was an incredibly smooth experience overall. The car has been impressive since then and we are so far extremely happy with the purchase. I will be recommending Volvo Cars of Austin and Emmett in particular.",5.0

We had worked with Emmett to get my wife's XC60 about a year ago, and while I was in the market for my new car they helped me find exactly what I was looking for.

14,"February 07, 2020","My husband and I came in just to test drive the XC40... Had other cars in mind at the time.
But, with the knowledge and information that Dennis had on this great car we actually ended up not even thinking about the other cars, and drove off the lot in an amazing and FUN to drive Volvo. What really sold us was the safety features and the drivability of the XC40. Dennis new so much about the car it was nice to finally go some place where they did not have to ""look up"" your questions to find the answers, He really did his homework!!  All in all, the experience at Volvo Cars of Austin was amazing, no stress or pressure and Ilia Pauloo was great with all the finance and paperwork.

21,"January 11, 2020","Jacob Selbe and Joe Salazar went out of their way to help us celebrate our 31st wedding anniversary, everything was first class.  We had to celebrate our Anniversary separate by long distance; Earline was completely surprised and excited about the XC90 and has been bragging on Facebook ever since. 
 
This is our fourth Volvo and the third Volvo we have bought sight unseen and that is because we know Volvo is the best car company out there, we can trust Volvo’s quality of engineering, work, and customer service and we also know Volvo stands behind it’s vehicles and provides excellent customer service.

22,"January 08, 2020","After spending more than a year looking for a vehicle to replace our beloved Honda minivan, my sister encouraged us to check out Volvo (she had just purchased an XC40). The vertical touchscreen and head-up display with the speed limit sign is definitely a game changer, and my husband was especially thrilled with all the technology and safety features packed into the XC60. Emmett Vick’s expertise and patience was very much appreciated. In addition, a few weeks after we purchased the SUV, I went by for a quick follow-up meeting to get my license plates. Emmett was kind enough to go over some of the vehicle’s features again - I vaguely remembered what some of the features did when we first looked at the vehicle and was thankful for the refresher. It was a great car-buying experience. We LOVE our new Volvo!

25,"January 03, 2020","Joe Salazar at Volvo Cars of Austin delivered a terrific car buying experience for me! I haven't bought a new car in 10 years and this is my first Volvo and wow, Joe was awesome! He was thorough, explained my options, confirmed my bike rack would work on the car which was a priority and the negotiations were painless as what I normally remember them to be. I am super pleased with Joe's honesty, integrity and empathy for buyers. I will definitely send friends his way! THANK YOU, JOE! I'm so happy with my XC60 Inscription!",5.0
26,"January 02, 2020","My husband and I had a very good experience working with Joe Salazar at Volvo of Austin recently.  He was such a refreshing change of pace from the usual car salesman and I really appreciated his calm, knowledgeable approach to showing us the car that we were interested in.  Joe explained a lot to us about the different models, features, and was very patient with us as we made up our minds on such a big purchase.  I was happy to be a customer of his and am thankful to know him so that we can return for future purchases.  My only criticism isn't of Joe but more just of car buying in general and the ""sales games"" that seem to take place.  It is almost impossible to know if a good deal has been negotiated or if we could have gotten a better price but in the end I got a shiny new car that I really do love and at a price I was willing to pay.  I will also say that once we were past the negotiating phase they really did not try to continue pushing more costs or slip in any fees like other dealerships.  Overall I give the experience 5 stars and especially Joe, I highly recommend him, he will really take care of you throughout the process!  ",5.0

31,"November 20, 2019","Chris White is a car salesman who is an educator not a typical car salesman. My wife and I have owned 9 Volvos over the years and at most dealerships buying is a push and shove process. Sales , managers , finance guys. I spent $50,000 because this guy was honest , well informed and got the job done AND I felt in control of the entire buying process. He answered every question and never tried to upsell the product . If you want a Volvo and a straight forward deal on your terms ask for Chris White . Llia Pauloo had me in and out of the finance end in 10 minutes. When does that ever happen ?",5.0

36,"October 25, 2019","I recently purchased a used automobile from Volvo of Austin for my wife. I worked specifically with Joe Salazar, a brand specialist who was absolutely fantastic to work with. He was honest, genuine, professional and refreshingly transparent. I will go out of my way to work with him on my next vehicle purchase. 
 I initially saw the car via the internet and was quickly connected to a Volvo rep (Joe) via the messaging system online. Being from out of town, I had quite a few questions and requests which were all answered with care and detail. Within hours I had a video of a walk around that he did on both the exterior and interior of the vehicle. He answered all my questions timely and never pushed me on a decision. After evaluating the car, I let him know the price I could afford and he helped me get to a number I could afford. . No hassling and very fair!  I agreed on a purchase before seeing the car in person and it turned out to be exactly as described which I believe is a true testament to the credibility of both Joe and Volvo Cars of Austin. 
The dealership is new, clean and everyone I interfaced with was customer focused. Thank you for a great customer experience from start to finish!",5.0

Living more than 200 miles away (Dallas, TX), you could imagine how many questions and requests that I had for my salesman. Dennis (MVP) was the most patient person I have dealt with in a while and being from the service industry I was very appreciative of the time he spent with getting all questions, concerns, and details sorted out.

He offered to come pick me up since I wasn't too far away! What a great guy. I finalized the purchase and I was off on my way.

65,"July 04, 2019","Excellent experience at Volvo Austin.  Michael Frohlich was my salesperson, and he was super knowledgeable and helpful during the process.  He's a really kind guy and didn't push or pressure me at all.  It took me 4 months to choose a car (I know!), and he met with me again and again and was very patient.  Plus if you're lucky, he'll show you a picture of his adorable dog.  Note: after I purchased my car, Michael checked in with me regularly to see how things were going, and to answer any questions I might have.

As for the dealership, they made purchasing my car easy peasy.  Straight shooters, and pretty quick for a car deal.  Also, the dealership is nice and new and has a lovely snack/ coffee bar if you need a good espresso.  

Most importantly, I LOVE my car.  It is peppy, safe, intuitively techy, quiet, comfy and fun to drive.  For real.  Happiest I've been with a car purchase since my Supra in high school!

Starting from my initial contact with Volvo of Austin on January 1 (when other dealerships were closed), he has proven very knowledgeable and patient - and very responsive!! There was nothing I asked him for which he didn’t have an answer - or couldn’t get me one! I even had other folks on some Volvo group pages to which I belong jealous of my sales guy based on the updates I’d post about while waiting for my car to come in. I would highly recommend him and Volvo of Austin for anyone looking for a new vehicle.",5.0

79,"February 09, 2019",Emmett is amazing- he was so incredibly helpful and patient and not too pushy. He listened well to what I wanted and found Volvos that met my needs. I didn’t even think I was going to purchase a Volvo (am a loyal BWM driver) but loved the car and the service! It also took longer than expected to execute the paperwork and I had an interview so they set me up in an office to take the interview. SO incredibly helpful!!! ,4.8

81,"January 18, 2019","We had a great experience buying a car at the Volvo dealership of Austin. We were looking to buy a used Honda Odyssey and we were really lucky to work with Stan Yordy, who has been selling cars for decades. His extensive knowledge and experience with used cars was invaluable.Thanks to Stan, the whole process went very smooth and we ended up with exactly what we wanted without the hassle we expected.

Stan was very professional and attentive to our needs from beginning to end; he provided all the necessary information about the vehicle, clearly outlined dealership's plans for it and helped us negotiate the right price. His approach is very relaxed, so we did not feel pressured into buying at any time. The final price was exactly as negotiated and there were no surprises about the car's technical condition after the purchase. We are very satisfied with the deal we got.

We also greatly appreciated that Stan went above and beyond what was required. Even though the car was being sold as is, he got it cleaned up at the dealership. He followed up after the deal was closed and went out of his way to get the dealership's technical report on the vehicle we bought. 

Thank you, Stan, for the exceptional experience! ",5.0

86,"November 12, 2018","I have to say smoothest car buying experience I have ever encountered. I am have been looking at what my next vehicle should be and pretty much wanted it all on a limited budget. I had been to a couple of car lots and regretted my approach of being open to sales opinions on what car would work best for my needs. Then I found Barry Shelnutt at Volvo Austin. We talked about my needs and what I wanted and he took me to the perfect match. We looked at a couple of different versions and weighed long term pros and cons. Once we got the price, there was no back and forth, knowing high end of KBB trade in value, I told him what I would accept on my Camry and whilst he inspected that vehicle I pulled up the value on my future Certified XCV60. The internet pricing marked wasn't far off the value and Autotrader had only one lower in NY! They gave me the trade in offer as well as worked with my counter offer on the Volvo that was it. No back and forth, no haggling. In fact, the purchase and finance processes were so streamlined that Barry and I had a chance to visit and really get to know one another while the cleaned my new car up.

Emmett is confident in his product and therefore is not pushy or brash, he has endless enthusiasm and is very forthcoming in sharing his knowledge of even the smallest details of the Volvo cars.

Emmett Vick kept me apprised of where my car was in the delivery process, and when it finally arrived, took such good care of me.  He explained the purchase process (which went seamlessly), and more importantly, sat with me in the car and explained everything in a clear and patient manner.  He even endured my sense of humor!  Emmett made sure I was comfortable with all the features of the vehicle.  And most of all, he said if I thought of anything after I left, not to hesitate to call him.  I cannot give Emmett a high enough endorsement, and also the dealership.  ",5.0

Emmitt was the BEST salesman I have ever had at a dealership - and my husband and I have owned 10 cars in 20 years.  My last car was a basic minivan; no bells or whistles so obviously this car was  a HUGE change.  Emmitt knew everything about this car and it's complicated technology.  He was so helpful and always responded to texts and calls immediately.  Thanks to his knowledge of the car, and his ability to explain it's details to me,  I was compelled to  select the Volvo over the Range Rover and Jaguar SUV.  Overall very pleased with the entire process.  ",4.6
92,"September 03, 2018","I've never had an easier time getting a new car, much less, probably the nicest car I've ever had.
I stopped in one day to just look at the S90.  I heard it was a wonderful car and I wanted to see it for myself.  I was also considering a BMW, but once I saw the S90, I knew that was the one I wanted.
I informed my salesman, Emmett Vick that I was just looking and I couldn't move on a car until I turned in my lease that was due in a month.  He showed me everything the car could do.  His knowledge of the car was impeccable and he didn't pressure me at all.  
A week later, I found out I could turn in my car early, so late at night, I happened to text Emmett figuring he would call me in the morning.  We carried on a conversation right then and he called me the next morning.  
Emmett and the sales manager, Shannon Stoppenhagen worked with me on my budget and met my price request.  
I came in the dealership at 2pm and I was out of the sales office, all papers signed, by 3:30!!
I can't thank the people enough at Volvo Cars of Austin for making this experience easy and FAST!!
Now my wife wants a Volvo as soon as we turn in her Honda next year!

As a married mom shopping for and purchasing the car alone, male salesmen at other places condescended and asked when I'd be bringing my husband in and BS like that.  No such treatment here -- Michael and all other staff with whom I interacted were professional, courteous and friendly.  The dealership is comfortable and attractive.

Emmett seeks to match a car precisely to a client’s needs, with an educated and personal approach second to none.

Cannot recommend highly enough. We arrived 90minutes before closing and he stayed with us til well after closing time to ensure we had the chance to drive everything that interested us. I learned more about general advances in technology in one visit with Emmett than all the other car dealer visits combined. He is the best!",4.8

He set us up with John Lank who was also such a nice guy and a pleasure to work with.

The amount of time Vanessa took with me and her enthusiasm for and love of Volvo cars was GREAT! They stayed late (since I had driven in from Houston) and were heads above the local dealers in accommodating my needs. Which was as simple as a fitted dog cover for the back seat.

112,"February 14, 2012","I bought a used vehicle from Georgetown Volvo on IH35 in Georgetown Texas. The vehicle had an obvious 1 inch crack in the windshield and I told them it would probably require windshield replacement to fix. (You think they would know that.) Before signing the contracts, they provided a form saying they would fix the “star” in the windshield within 30 days. My mistake for signing before the repair. 

They sent a mobile repair guy to look at the windshield. He said a repair had already been attempted, finding the drill hole but seeing that the cracks were still not filled in. He said he could not do work over the first repair attempt. 

The salesman and manager responded by saying the windshield was “fixed” and that they would not replace the windshield but would try to get me a “wholesale” cost if I wanted to pay for it myself (!). I took the vehicle to a reputable nation wide glass repair shop, who said the attempted repair provided very marginal improvement if any. They also said they could not work over the botched repair without destroying the windshield. They said the only option was windshield replacement. So basically I had a signed document from Georgetown Volvo saying they would fix the windshield, but now they refused to honor it. 

I had a follow on discussion with the sales manager, who still denied that a replacement was necessary. I sent him the quote from the other glass place. After 2 more days of no response, I drove the vehicle back to the dealership and dared them to tell me that the windshield crack was ""fixed."" They finally relented and paid to have a local glass shop replace the windshield.
