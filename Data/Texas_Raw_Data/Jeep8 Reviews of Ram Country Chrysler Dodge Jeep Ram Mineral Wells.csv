1,"July 15, 2018", The people at this dealership are a bunch of liars. They ran our credit through four different people after we told him we did not want it to be ran.  They assured us it wouldnâ€™t be done because the people that had the dealership before they have it now did the same thing to us. We will never do Business with this company ever again and will tell everyone how crappy they are. ,1.0
2,"February 18, 2018","I bought my 2011 Ford F150 from Ram Country. I drove 90 miles to go out there for this truck because it met almost all of my criteria.  Morgan was a great sales person and even though there were a couple of hiccups about a check engine light, she did everything she could do and we found a resolution that satisfied all parties.  I'm grateful for her effort and care that made my truck buying experience a little less stressful. ",4.6
3,"September 05, 2017",I was able to get my vehicle scheduled easily and when I brought my vehicle in for my appointment I was greeted kindly and was in and out within an hour. I would highly recommend this service department. Oil change and Rotate was done for less than $30 as well!!,5.0
4,"January 24, 2017","This was the most awful car buying experience i have ever had! I was made promise after promise that was never met. I was told the first trip i made, i was guarenteed a car that night, a charger at that. Then when i got there i was told it would be 0 down, 500 a month. Great deal right?? Well after sitting for 3 hours. They decide i cant get the charger and say i can get approved for a dart, with the same price off 0 down and 500 a month for a ""starter car"" now, not happy about it, but i decided maybe they were right and i just needed to do that to and then get my charger in a year. So i agree to what he says. Then they suddenly tell me, oh we cant do anything tonight you will have to come back monday. 
   Monday: i show up to dealership, promised 0 down and 500 a month on the dart. And now the GM is involved. He comes over sits down, and tells us, ""well, we need 1000 down"" im shocked. And say well i was already promised 0 down. He said, ""well reguardless, its martin luther king day, im not calling the banks"" so what am i doing driving an hour here for nothing to be done!?!?!! We finally convince him to call the banks. In the end after another 3 hrs and they are closed, we leave again with no car. They tell us to come back the next day (tuesday) and we will leave with the car.

Tuesday: we show up and the gm and financial lady are gone. At this point were under the assumption of 500-1000 down for the dart. And i finally cave and just give up. And tell them im done.
I get a call telling me they have it all figured out. To give them another chance. So i decide to let them redeem themselves. 

One week later (tuesday): i show up at 2. Already told them what time i would be there. GM said, do 500 down and i guarentee everything is done! Excited i say ok! And i head that way. I get there. First its 500 down and were waiting for the approval, 3 hrs later, i finally try to figure out whats going on. They cant get me approved!!! WHY ARE YOU GIVING ME NUMBERS YOU HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT?!?! So she comes back and says, look a 1000 down and were golden. We pondered for a few minutes and and decided we would do it. So she goes back in..... Comes back still not approved. Nobody is telling us anything. So i walk back in her office where shes running our credit for a FORD FOCUS?!?!?! Where did this come from??? She said, ""well its your only option"" what happened to the dart??? Nobody could give me a straight answer. This ford is 2 years older, 50000 miles, and no bells and whistles and she says.... ""We may need 1500 down now"" im just floored at this point. 4 trips (1.5 hours there 1.5 hours back) and 16 HOURS actually at the dealership and not one of them cared. I  beside myself on this. I will NEVER do buisness or reccomend to anyone. I worked with claudia and she was the only one who actually took into considered what i needed and what i was saying.",1.0
5,"August 15, 2016","My Durango was purchased April 5, 2016 and 4 1/2 months later, I still have no license plates. The TX DMV complaint department was contacted and my car was shown to have been purchased on June 3. Something fishy is happening at this dealership. I have been lied to by nearly everyone that I have talked to since 5 weeks after I purchased the vehicle. Not a satisfied customer!",1.0
6,"August 13, 2015","We have tried a few different car dealers in town they had nothing we could live with. Christopher Lee at RAM COUNTRY worked diligently for us to get the best deal possible. We are really excited about our new purchase, this is just what we were looking for and at a price we could live with. They treated us like VIPS.  WE HIGHLY RECOMMEND RAM COUNTRY FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR A VEHICLE.",5.0
7,"July 22, 2014","I would not recommend this service center to anyone. Absolutely horrible experience. Great management team but thats where it stops. Employees in the back do not do the proper inspections and hot rod vehicles on test drive after ""repairs"". They do not check even the most simple things such as an air filter. The service manager is a great guy and cannot be all places at once and babysit employees. I was not happy at all. I'll tru anything twice and will return with very high supervision from myself to ensure everything is done properly. ",1.8
