5,"March 03, 2020","Sterling Acura of Austin is still selling the 2020 RDX with a known brake issue.  After buying the SUV I noticed that brakes are squeaking when you first start driving.  On a brand new 2020 vehicle that shouldn't be the case, but I know things can happen.  I contacted the service department and was informed by the service manager that this is a known issue and that there isn't a fix for it yet. Now doing some internet research this issue started with the 2019 model and still no fix for this problem.  Just surprising that a $40k vehicle would have an issue like this and not have a fix after a year. So if you don't want to drive around in a vehicle with a known issue like this don't buy an RDX.  Especially from Sterling since they know this is an issue and don't inform you.  This squeaking did not occur during the test drive.  The buying process and service was excellent, but shouldn't sell cars with known issues like this.",1.0

Of course, we have been leasing vehicles from Sterling for the past 8 years.Our first internet shopping experience with GSM, now President, Adrian Davis, we kept coming back and it easy to see that Adrian has carried forward the customer first, trusted and delighting service culture at Sterling. Ray Dominguez has developed and outstanding sales team that support each other to provide great service and value. Lester Brown and Ben Guttierrez combine to provide a hassle free fair price offer based on our financial requirement. Ben actually delivered the vehicle to our home and demonstrated great value and passage tutoring my wife and I on the capabilities of the Tech Package. Jay Buck, Finance Manager, prepared the agreement and financials, explained everything and had all the paperwork in order for us to sign upon delivery, Event though we were in process with the deal Marial King and Anita followed up on my web inquiries to make sure we were engaged.

There’s no way to see mileage or if the vehicle needs to alert the driver of an issue. This is a major part of the vehicle that I cannot do without. Had this been present there’s is no way I’d buy this vehicle. Along with blank screen it’s making a terrible high pitch noise while that screen is not lit. the only issue that was told to me was the sunroof not working which I was told while they were already running my credit. The salesman said he was not aware. Ok that’s fine. Luckily they gave me a small discount. I can deal with the sunroof because I agreed to that but I can’t drive it like this. I called the dealer and was pretty much told I was on my own. The salesman said he’d call to try to find out what could be wrong and call me back but had yet to do so. I’ve called three times with no return call. This issue was not even 30 minutes from taking it off the lot. One of the salesman mentioned this was a family owned business and that they pride thierselves in customer service which it seems like that’s only in reference to before you actually pay.

Almost $600 for rear differential and brake fluid replacement, cooling system service, oil change with filter plus tire rotation and balance? Also, why I always have to mention that I have the Maintenance Advantage Plan? If I do not bring it up I am sure I’ll get charged full price.

Also, I asked to check tire inflation and each tire had +2.5 psi average when I got into my car with cold tires. Courtesy wash was also bad. The car was covered with water spots.

I know I'm just one person and my review won't change how this dealership does business but as a single female, I certainly feel taken advantage of by Sterling Acura. Even with a loaner, it's simply not worth it to have repairs done there any more. I'd have been better off renting a car on my own and having the repairs done elsewhere.

I don't think they were quite ready for us when we arrived - like I expected paperwork to be somewhat  ready since we had already agreed upon a price and we had put a deposit down and we had completed credit app, but I guess they have to try to sell you all the extras and so they won't do it ahead of time.

When I went back to my car after the work was complete I noticed oily finger prints and what appeared to be scratch marks on the aluminum trim on the driver's side center console.  I went back into the dealership and the service person and I looked at the issue.  I told him the trim wasn't like that when I brought in the car.  I take very good care of the car and have a lint free cloth in the car that I wipe any fingerprints and clean any dust with.  After looking at the trim, he said he would need to get the Service Director to look at the issue.  I asked if he could have someone take some cleaner and a rag to the trim piece, but he said the Service Director would have to look at the scratches.  When he came back with the Service Director (Tim Caldwell) they went into the car and were speaking loudly.  I could hear the Service Director saying the damage couldn't have been caused by the oil change service.  He then came around to the passenger side where I was standing and said in a loud and accusatory tone ""Are you saying the scratches on the passenger side aluminum trim are also caused by us?""  I looked at the passenger side trim and said ""There are no scratches on the passenger side."".  He started to argue and I said ""Look, just do whatever you feel is right.""  He then said ""We will replace the trim but it didn't happen here!""  I asked him if he was accusing me of lying.  He said ""I'm saying the damage wasn't caused by us.""

I went home and using a lint free cloth and some soap I cleaned and polished the trim piece as well as the trim around the door handle and steering wheel.  That removed the oil and scratch marks.

I got to test drive a TLX AND take it home overnight with the only sales pitch being if you don't want to purchase just return it and the keys with no committment - and they meant it!!

200,"October 05, 2016","I recently purchased my first Acura (ILX) from Sterling Acura via TrueCar and the experience was nothing short of professional and enjoyable. It started with Ashley Sanchez who reached out to me regarding my interest in buying a certified pre-owned Acura ILX. After expressing my willingness to travel outside of Austin to acquire vehicle within my price range, Ashley made an offer which convinced me to make a visit for a test drive. After visiting Sterling Acura, I was greeted by Reuben Villarreal, Sales Consultant, who gave me one of the best purchasing experiences I ever had.

Neil Palmquist was easygoing, yet very professional, knowledgable, and thorough in his explanations and demonstration of everything the MDX had to offer. 
He demonstrated all the new safety features, including lane keeping and adaptive cruise control in several different traffic conditions (always easy to find traffic in Austin) so that I was confident when I test drove it myself I wouldn't be fumbling trying to figure out the controls (simple, really)! 
I also really appreciated his taking a rough-road route to demonstrate the good handling and different choices for power and suspension...there were really discernible differences! So many dealerships have a short little proscribed route they want you to take...and that doesn't demonstrate anything well at all. 
Neil's enthusiasm for the vehicle and for sharing his knowledge was evident. Very nice guy.

225,"July 23, 2016","We went into Sterling Acura to drive a certified pre-owned Acura TLX they had listed on their website.  This is the first Acura i have ever driven.  My current Honda Accord had 195,000 on it and decided it was time to go car shopping.  We were introduced to Neil and he proceeded to introduce us to their service dept and lounge area while the car was being prepped for our test drive.  Loved the car but told him this was the first place we stopped and were going to test drive different makes and models.  He wasn't pushy and understood.  As we left, he said we were welcome to take the TLX home for the weekend since we live over an hour away.  Needless to say after test driving another car at another dealership we called him and said we'd take him up on it.  This was 10 minutes before they were closing.  Since Neil was helping another couple, he introduced us to Wess, another sales associate, who helped us switch our stuff from car to car as well as synched my iphone with the audio system.  When we returned the car, we had all intentions of purchasing the TLX if we could settle on a fair purchase price and trade in for the Accord.  DONE!  Neil and Wess made our buying experience easy squeezey.  I refer to it as TWITA! (that's what i'm talking about)  i don't normally give reviews.

231,"July 07, 2016","BEWARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My car drove 2,198 miles without an engine air filter. Car broke down while on vacation to the coast.  Tim Caldwell of Sterling Acura asked what I wanted him to do.  AutoNation Acura who cleaned clogged MAF and put missing air filter in. Sterling did nothing to vehicle but run a compression test and per my request did a borescope with color pics. Tim Caldwell said that the reading for all 4 cylinders tested at 275 p.s.i.and that the pics showed no signs of sand or sand residue. I sent pics for a second opinion(ASE certified Technician) and he stated:: A normal cylinder wall will have a cross-hatch pattern on it from when cylinders are board and honed. These are the angled  lines that cross each other sideways that you see. All of the vertical strait lines on cylinder walls were caused by the sand getting into cylinders and getting caught between the compression rings on pistons and cylinder walls, causing damage to both rings and the walls. Also the Black and Shiny build-up on top of the pistons is sand. the top of the pistons should not have any solid particle build-up at all at just over 20k miles. They are still saying there is nothing wrong with my vehicle when a second opinion said otherwise.They have not provided me with documentation for other opinions.Tim also stated: He knows (owner Mr.Davis) we have done our best to do what is right and now you are seeking counsel. At this point Mr. Davis wants us to get our loaner back and get your car back to you. Accept my car back when the problem has not been addressed.

235,"May 05, 2016","My email to the dealership if you care to read it - 

I am not sure what the reason was for the way this has transpired.  I can only assume that in a situation like mine you do not make a lot on commission due to the lease and negative equity, possibly.   I do not know, but the experience and style that was used in handling me as a customer was indicative of just that .  I have waited for you to email me back “in the afternoon”, only to get something after the dealership closed.  The time between replies has been frustrating.  I may not be the most profitable sale or customer at this time, but that will change in the very near future and it is these experiences that will guide me to or away from businesses, even whole brands of products.  
I love cars, and tend to want to change cars often, which is not easy with leasing and negative equity and just my salary to work with.  My grandmother passed away and it has been a few years of a messy estate battle because there was a lot of money.  That turns people into sharks, so the whole family has been tearing at each other to get this money that was left to me, and only me.  When the whole thing is done I will be able to indulge in my favorite things, and cars are about the top thing on my list.  The NSX is what I had planned on buying first.
I will not however be coming anywhere near Sterling Acura…  I will go to David McDavid for my needs currently, and or a whole other brand of cars.  I will never forget how rude you were having been gone on lunch when I calle and then when I showed up well over an hour later I found you still at lunch.  I waited at least 15 minutes after the receptionist called to let you know I was there.  I had almost two hours earlier left you a voicemail telling you  I would be coming in.  I finally asked the receptionist what time you would be back, and should I go run errands if it would be a while.  She looked at her computer and said “I think I see her” and went to go “grab her”. Several minutes at least went by before the receptionist tells me “she is going to have Ben help you”.   After another two minutes Ben was still nowhere to be found so I left.  I did however get a follow up email a few HOURS later with “Im so sorry I missed you”.  IT was the same day , so I should feel VIP status I suppose.

I have communicated with Courtney this whole time, and the fact she was there but could not even walk out to greet me before passing me off to some random person was very rude.  Then not having come herself, to have said random person not even come introduce himself is just laughable really.   The worst customer service in a sales environment I have seen in a long time.  I do not know how many cars you people actually sell, but I imagine it is much lower than it would be if you had even the slightest interest in making the customer experience something more than what one would expect at the Department of Public Safety Licensing Office – or a busy  hospital ER even.  

I know this was a waste of time writing this, almost as much a waste of time as it was to go in to the dealership with the cash I wanted to put down to take care of negative equity and keep payments lower.  Good luck Acura and I mean in when I say that being a customer was an experience.  Have not got a survey harassment call or email yet but I am keeping my eyes open and phone nearby in case they do request one.

236,"March 18, 2016","I did not have a great experience leasing a ""new"" demo Acura MDX with 3,400 miles on it for $850 off from them in December 2015. It was still dirty with scratches in the trunk after 3 details. The GM said he was the only one who drove it, but his wife's cell phone was programmed in the car and I discovered a dirty makeup brush in the car after I took it home. 

Ryan, their finance director, was particularly hard to deal with.  They promised me a free oil change for leasing the demo, but then up sold me on a maintenance package after I told him as well as the 2 sales guys I was working with at least 10 times  that I had no time to drive down south and was planning to have service done at a Honda dealer close to my house.  Plus, he threatened to turn me into a collections agency if I disputed the down payment while I was waiting to get answers, refund on maintenance package, and paid for add-ons to the car.

I finally had some time as a busy, professional, single mom to write up my whole experience and send it to Acura Corporate. The additional unprofessional treatment I experienced is too long to write about here. I hope they learn to empathize more with their clients and communicate better over email and text for busy professionals.",1.6
237,"September 24, 2015","I purchased a brand new tsx 09 from this dealership. I paid sticker price and have had nothing but problems with this car and dealer from the very beginning. The car had a bad VTC actuator that they would not fix for the first 50k miles of the vehicle. Said They couldnt reproduce my complaint.  Finally after scratching and rattling increased over time they replaced it around 50k. Then the car begins to burn oil excessively. They make me track and log my oil consumption for over 30k miles to tell me in the end that there wasn't anything they could do and continued to try and  upsale me.  The loud rattling and oil burning was normal.  They were rude and demeaning on several occasions and have proved to be incredibly stressful to deal with. They blamed the oil consumption on my lack of maintnence. I have excellent records so that did not make any sense. Now there is a warranty extension on the parts that have probably been causing me problems this whole time..time to monitor again, To see if I qualify after all I've been through. This procedure is frustrating but necessary. I'm not sure if they will ever make my car right.  Bottom line is that they need substantial help with customer relations.  For them, it's normal for my Acura to be burning oil like crazy at 65k and for a rattling sound to come from engine. Beware consumer- you could go in there and purchase a brand new vehicle and keep perfect maintnence records to have it consuming oil at high rates as early as 60k, along with other engine issued and they will tell you it's normal and will do nothing about it. The service department needs some real tuning.

The used car/leasing agent showed me around to Guage my interests.  We called about my loan at bank and then I was handed over to an accountant in sales manager.  This self promoted hot shot had my veh 'once over'd' by the resale minions and when he sat down with me confronted me with a report about my veh and the issues that they would need to do to bring it 'up to Par' to resale.  He then told me that 'WE HAVE GOT A BIG PROBLEM HERE'  with your veh and that there was more loan than value remaining on my veh.  Although I would have been easily encouraged to add money to make the veh. Easy to trade in, I was so humiliated by the apparent Acura practice of 'beating down my value' and... my negotiating position' in order for Acura to boost theirs, I walked out of the building never to buy an Acura or deal with Acura dealerships again.  This was the sole result of the self proclaimed 'gate-keeper' that was the sales manager at Sterling.  I believed the rest of the dealership was ok but due to that individual's aggressive 'positioning' I will never buy Acura again.

240,"June 30, 2014","So our brand new 2014 MDX developed a loud buzzing noise at around 1,700rpm.  I’ve researched the issue and turns out there’s a service bulletin to correct this related to the VCM turning on/off so I called Sterling for an appointment.  That’s where things went south from there:

1.)	Loaner Car Issues - Initial phone call on Friday to setup appointment, I was told that I can’t get a loaner car because the service takes “only” 1.5hrs.  I was told it needs to take longer than 2hrs to get a loaner.  Fine, took a book with me and was ready to wait in the waiting area.  When I get there I’m told I can get a rental only because they don’t have the parts to fix the car and it will be ready the next day.
2.)	Timely Service Issues – Called them Saturday, car not ready.  Called them Monday, car still not ready.  Called them Tuesday, car not ready.  Called them Wednesday, car is ready.  OK, great, would have been nice if they called me instead of me having to call them.  No one ever called to let us know that vehicle was ready for pickup.
3.)	Service Issues – not sure what they did to our MDX if anything over the 5 days they had it but it still buzzes like it used to.  Would have been nice if they test drove it before telling us that it’s ready.
4.)	Sales dept.  number one priority is to make money off you otherwise they are not interested in your business.  So our new MDX was hit on the side by another driver and we’re working with their insurance company to settle a diminished value claim.  The insurance company told us to take it to an Acura dealership and get a trade in appraisal to settle the claim so we did.  After getting the run around between different sales associates for several days we finally were routed to Jon Boren, the sales manager.  Right off the bat Jon made us feel uncomfortable with questions such as “are you going to trade in your vehicle, well…I can’t help you then” and “did you buy your vehicle from us, hmmmm…no, well, did you cross shop us when you purchased it.”  This went on for a while and finally Jon agreed to write “something up” for us that we need to present to the insurance company.  To make a long story short this went on for over a week, all along we were strung along that they already appraised the car and “just need to type it up”.  After a week of waiting with unreturned phone calls from Jon and constantly being told by the receptionist that he’s “busy” or “not on property” we received a call from Jon that he will not give us an appraisal in writing.  “If you were to be trading in the vehicle then it would be different but we can’t just give you an appraisal.  There are companies out there that you can pay that will do that for you.  Maybe the dealership where you bought it from can give you one.”

Thanks Sterling Acura for holding our vehicle for 5 days, giving us stress all week, making empty promises, and accomplishing absolutely nothing!",1.0
241,"June 07, 2013","I used to sell cars and I promised to not be that customer that test drove everything.  Alas, I ended up being that person.  I knew I wanted another Acura but wasn't sure how far to downsize from my MDX.  Luckily, the customer service rep was very patient and not pushy.  Veronica at the front desk is an absolute charm to talk to.  John supported his staff to make the experience very pleasant and low hassle.  I ended up getting a Pre Owned Certified TL.  I couldn't be any happier with my experience!  Thanks Ben, Veronica, and John.  ",5.0
242,"April 14, 2011",The show room was well lit and there where many new cars on display in very nice colors. The sale people where very nice and not pushy. They brought my new car to me nice and clean with gas in it. My friends and family are looking forward to doing bussiness with Sterling in the very near future. ,5.0
243,"April 12, 2011","The Team at Sterling Acura is top notch, from attention to every detail on your vehicle, to making sure you're in and out in a timely manner. I've purchased three Acuras from Sterling Acura and cant say enough about how smooth, professional, and precise the entire process is. 

When purchasing an Acura from this dealer you get a lot more than a pat on the back and a due date for your first service. Every interaction I've had with this dealer has been a positive one. I've owned BMW's and have sat in dealerships, while service advisers plan an ""attack"" on your wallet by overselling you for services and parts. Contrary to other dealers you're not forced or pressured to make spare of the moment purchases. 

Inside Sterling Acura's waiting room you'll enjoy a warm, comfortable environment. 
Services continue to be a breeze, with precise scheduling and ETAs, I couldn't be happier this Acura is my dealer.

Don't just take my word for it, walk in and experience for yourself, you'll be driving an Acura sooner than you think.",5.0
244,"May 11, 2009","Took my Acura RL in to replace a broken power window motor last month. I had called them previously and clearly described the problem and they said they could fix it in one short visit. Made appointment and took in for repair. They proceeded to literally tear off the protective plastic sheeting I had installed to cover the open window, told me they would need to order the part and ""I should come back in a few days"" (!??).

I asked them to replace / repair plastic sheeting covering window opening and they gave me a load of horses**t. After speaking to Service Manager - they pulled out my (now-torn) sheeting and taped it up in a truly amaeuter fashion.

Unfortunately, this has been very typical of my past expereinces with Sterling Acura - very limited customer service and no respect for customer's time or property. This dealer is so different than other Acura dealer (Acura Car Land in Atlanta) I have used it is not even funny. 

Their pricing is absurd - something like $110/hour for auto tech labor rates and parts prices way over the top. I just priced out additional service work (timing belt / water pump/ spark plugs)and Sterling gave me a price of $1,990 plus tax and disposal fees. This is almost double the price of two reputable independent service facilities in Austin. 

Do yourself a favor and do not give these buffoons your service business. Instead frequent local independent shops for your sevice needs, and you will be both happier and have hundreds of dollars left to spend on more important things.",1.6
