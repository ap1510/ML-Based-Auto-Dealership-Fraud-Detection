0,"May 15, 2020","We went to Hiley Hyundai to look at new vehicles right at the COVID outbreak was becoming more well-known. But there we no official orders to stay home at the time and the dealership was accommodating test drives and such.

That day I chose a 2020 Hyundai Santa Fe but the color and model I wanted was not available aside from the one we'd driven. We pointed out that there were dings in the paint and bubbles in the chrome grill. The dealership admitted these flaws, that this NEW car was imperfect before handing off. 

They offered to either a) order another car and we could wait or b) that since the issues were cosmetic, we could come back once the virus had calmed down and they would fix the dinged paint from transport and replace the chrome that had bubbled up places and areas that were obvious manufacturing problems, NOT wear and tear.

Since we the issues were cosmetic and I'd dealt with Hiley regarding service on the Santa Fe I currently owned (at the time) and had enjoyed stellar service, I had no reason to believe they would do anything but hold to their word and make the banged up 2020 Santa Fe as good as new as they had promised.

Roughly six weeks later, we brought in the car once it was safe to do so with a pandemic in play. They provided a rental and kept my car for some time. I had no reason, given the length of time they kept the car, to imagine they'd done such slap-shod work. When I finally went to pick up the car, it was as if they'd done nothing. 

Not only did they charge me to for touch-up paint which I confusingly and grudgingly agreed to (thinking they'd done actual body paint work, not bought a touch up pen), but they touched up the chrome only on one side and with paint.

They did NOTHING to repair the grill of the car with where the chrome was bubbled and delaminating...which is a manufacturing issue not a wear and tear problem. This issue occurs when the composite is hit with an electric charge. This then is when the chrome adheres to the material. If there are any imperfections, you will get bubbles or areas where the chrome doesn't adhere properly.

They also listed on the invoice they had washed and vacuumed the car, but the car was filthy and there was still grass all over the floorboards from when I'd been transporting plants before dropping off the car.

This only fuels my suspicion they did as little as possible, if anything to the vehicle.

I was extremely angry. I told him the car hadn't even been washed, and he assured me it was pollen. The manager of the dealership came out, allowed me to take the rental car home and asked me to give him an opportunity to make it right.

Apparently, his idea of making things ""right"" was to have his salesperson, Mr. Fansler, insinuate that he'd made no such agreements with my husband and that we must have been mistaken, that he'd only agreed to touch up the nicked chrome (even though we have the fact the car was damaged in transport in writing).

Not only did the dealership essentially insinuate that no such agreement was made and that we were responsible for the damage and must, I suppose, have made up the problems, they refused to fix any of the damage they'd promised to make right if I purchased the car that day.

They've done nothing but play dumb that we never pointed out the other problems and that this must all be figments of our imagination. I am beyond vexed that there is nothing I can do. Against my better judgement, I bought a banged up new car from Hiley. 

They KNOWINGLY sold that car with a promise to fix the cosmetic damage and now have reneged on their word. Not only that, but the touch ups they did to the paint are horrific. It looks like someone cut loose a five-year-old with a bottle of OPI nail polish on my car...the areas they actually bothered touching up.

I put $10,000 cash down on a vehicle, bought a new car, did everything in good faith and now every time I look at what should have been my birthday present I feel ill. I feel extorted and duped. These were simple cosmetic issues that were there when we took hold of the car. Hiley KNEW that and they are now playing as if they didn't.

My husband went to pick up the car again today after all this. They again, didn't bother washing or vacuuming the car. It was filthy and the floorboards STILL covered in grass.

This is WRONG, and unfortunately, there is nothing I can do other than drive a banged up 2020 Santa Fe. I've launched a fraud complaint with Hyundai Corporate and filed a complaint with the State AG, the BBB and even consulted an attorney. If anyone is curious about the veracity of my complain, feel free to look to my one-star Google review that includes pictures.

BECAUSE OF ALL THIS, I RECENTLY DID MORE EXTENSIVE RESEARCH INTO COMPLAINTS WHICH NOW I WISH I HAD DUG DEEPER TO FIND BEFORE I GAVE THEM MY MONEY & TIME. IRONICALLY, I  SEE COMPLAINTS REGARDING THE ""OOPS THAT'S A MISTAKE-BY MY SALES MGR"" SCAM. SO IT'S NOT AN ISOLATED INCIDENT!

6,"July 20, 2019","On Friday 7/12/2019, I stopped by this dealership because I liked the online price for the 2019 Santa Fe XL with stock #H2521.  On the dealer's website, it showed MSRP of $36,090 minus $3,965 Hiley discount minus $3,000 factory offer that everyone gets at any Hyundai dealership for this vehicle.  Final Hiley Hyundai online price showed $29,125.  That was the best price I had seen all day after visiting 5 other Hyundai dealerships in the DFW area.  When I walked in and wanted to make the purchase for the advertised price, the salesman got with his manager and came back with something totally different than what was mentioned online.  They said their sales price was several thousand more than the online price.  When I questioned why the online price was different, they claimed they made some additions to the car.  I then asked why the online price wasn't updated to reflect the additions they made and no excuse was given.  I immediately stood up, left, and never went back.  I went to a competitor of theirs in Irving, TX later that evening to buy the exact same model they had at nearly the exact fake price Hiley Hyundai displayed.  As of 7/20/2019, the Hiley Hyundai online price continues to show the incorrect $29,125 and not include the ""add-ons"" they made.  Very shady characters at Hiley Hyundai of Burleson. Stay away from Hiley Hyundai in Burleson.  They missed out on my business for life.",1.0
7,"May 14, 2019","This place is awful and a total joke. They took my father-in-law's trade-in (he's 70+ and SUPER TRUSTING of other people) and sold him a car that had been hit and was clearly smoked in. He took the car back within three days and pointed these things out to them and they told him to essentially shove it, he can't have his other car back without giving them thousands of dollars and that they didn't care what he said, or ANYTHING about online reviews. This place is awful. My wife and I walked out of there after they tried to sell us a 24k dollar vehicle at 72 months with a payment of roughly $560 a month. We have excellent credit. This comes out to over 40k on the cost of the vehicle. They are totally dishonest and clearly try to scam people. We listened to them telling another set of people that the most they could get for their trade was $400 when the vehicle was easily worth a couple thousand bucks. I can't recommend enough for people to avoid this place like the plague!",1.0
8,"December 17, 2018","This was a excellence experience for me. My initial visit was to get my vehicle serviced but ended up purchasing a new Santa Fe. Lisa Conway, was still new but went out of her way to make sure I was satisfied with her service, because I wasn't feeling my best when I was there. I would recommend Hiley Hyundai, to anyone looking for a new or used Hyundai's. Mike, New Car Manager, Seth Finance Manager & Lisa Conway, were able to pull together and work out a deal for me. Thanks for everything.",5.0
9,"November 16, 2018","I would NEVER set foot in the establishment again due to the BAIT and SWITCH tactics and complete lack of integrity displayed. I was first issued an online price quote on the vehicle that I was after. I drove the extra distance after work to view the vehicle and get everything set up. Once I arrived, I was informed that I had to use Hyundai Motor Financing in order to get the agreed upon price and the loan type was a balloon payment as well. I was not thrilled about this because I had already let him know I had financing approved at my credit union but I agreed that I would use their financing and went forward with the transaction. I agreed to return to the dealership in a few days to purchase the vehicle and once again drove out after work to complete the transaction. More BAIT and SWITCH from there. I was sitting in Randy Leyva's office, which overlooked the showroom floor that the car was sitting on. He sent the car back to have it prepped for the sale. After a while, Randy returned to his office with bad news. The car we agreed to just had a price hike of over 2K dollars. His reasoning was that it had a leather package installed and he wasn't aware of it. We went over the car with a fine tooth comb, I took pictures and we actually discussed how nice the leather seats were. It said in big bold letters LEATHER PACKAGE on the windshield and he must have walked past this car every day he worked since it was feet from his door. For him to claim he overlooked it was simply unbelievable.  He said he could get me another similar car without the leather which I rejected without hesitation. He knew he wasn't able to sell me the car for that price and yet he continued to waste my time bringing me into the dealership. Other reviews describe bait and switch tactics used at this dealership and I can you tell you first hand this is how they conducted our business. I was told I would receive two 50.00 gas cards for my troubles and almost three months later I have received nothing. I would steer clear of this place. Other dealerships should realize tactics like these are what give car dealers a bad name. Shamefully dishonest and a complete waste of my time! I explained in follow up emails that there were plenty of similar negative reviews online and he said he didn't really care due to the fact he deals with so many people. bad experiences are bound to happen. I recommend that you find another dealership that will treat you with respect and honesty....Buyer Beware!!",1.0

22,"October 15, 2017","Before going into the details, I want to make clear that my experience with Onye, the sales rep, was very pleasant.  He was very nice and professional, and answered all of the questions about the automobile that I had.  I give him hands down 10 out of 10 as a sales rep.    Everything in my experience outside of Onye was extremely unprofessional and had me almost walk away from the purchase at several points along the way.  I went through USAA auto buying, which gave me a price for the specific vehicle that I was interested in.  When I went to the dealership, the first thing I did was show them my paperwork (with the price), and from there the sale continued (no mention of anything that would raise the price.)  I took a test drive of the vehicle, was pleased, and decided to purchase.  From this point, the whole experience deteriorated.  After keeping me waiting for periods of 15-20 minutes at a time, I was told that I was not military, so they'd have to add $500 to the price.  Another 20 minutes goes by, and they tell me that price only is valid if financed through Hyundai Financing (I already had all of the pre-approval paperwork ready to go to finance through my bank).  After straight-up asking if they could give me the car, at the price the the Auto Buying service quoted me, Onye told me ""no.""  I shook his hand, and walked out of the dealership.  I was very angry at their dishonest, bait-and-switch, business practices at this point.  Either sell me the car for the price agreed upon through the car-buying service, or don't have your internet manager publish that price to get me into the door.  Even if you can't sell me the vehicle for the Internet price, tell me this when I come in and show you the paperwork (before I test drive the car), that the price is inaccurate.    A couple of days later, I received a follow up email from an Internet rep named Cassidy, and I explained my frustrating visit to her.  She apologized, and told me that the manager would agree to sell me the car for the original price that my auto buying service quoted me.  When I asked her for the total price, including TT&L, dealer adds, and financing through MY bank, I was given a price of about $25,600.  I immediately noticed that in her price breakdown, she said that tax was $1925, a figure that represents a tax rate of 8.25%.  I immediately called her on the phone, and after pointing out that the tax rate is only 6.25%, she told me that she might have made a mistake, but that the manager is STILL firm on the bottom line price, but would only agree to any further negotiating if I came in to the dealership in person - and that evening only.    So, reluctantly, I went back to the dealership.  The manager never came out to speak with me.  I sat back down with Onye, who essentially insisted that I finance through Hyundai Motors, and that the rate would be 3.39% for a 72 month term (I SPECIFICALLY asked him ""for 72 months?"" to clarify, and he told me YES).  Since my bank was offering me 3.29%, and he was agreeing to knock off $250 more of the price, I begrudgingly agreed.  With my wife and 6 year old son waiting over 2 hours, I finally sat down with Alvin to ink out the deal.  I see in the paperwork 2 things that make my blood boil.  FIRST, the sales tax is $1,500 - NOT $1925.  When I called him on it, he basically just said this is the price, take it or leave it.  SECOND, the APR listed is 3.79%, not 3.39% that I was told by Onye.  When I called him on that, he told me that the 3.39% was for 60 months, and was rudely insinuating that he could go ahead and change my term to 60 months (after I have clearly established that I am seeking a 72 month term).  At this point, I'm exhausted, my family is exhausted.  We are hungry, and I just want to buy the xxxx car.  I sign the paperwork, and the car is delivered the next day.  As if my experience in the car buying process wasn't bad enough, a couple days later I get a call back from Alvin saying that I need to come in again and resign the paperwork (this, AFTER I have been driving it now for a day or two), and that my rate was going to actually be 3.99%.  When I told him ""NO,"" that if they're going to do that to me I'm just going to finance through my own bank, he told me that he would be adding $750 to the price of the car for doing so.  Over another $2/mo, I decided to just let another thing go (again, I already had been driving the car - I couldn't return it at this point?!?), and begrudgingly went back in to sign the final paperwork.  All in all, in the almost two weeks of driving it, I love the car.  I had a great experience with Onye.  But I will never be purchasing a vehicle again from such a dishonest dealership.  And even though I, nor any of my family and friends will ever be purchasing a vehicle from Hiley Hyundai of Burleson again in our lives, I hope by sharing my experience I can save a few more potential clients the heartache of dealing with such dishonest, bait-and-switch car dealership personnel, and advising them to take their car-buying needs elsewhere.",2.2

24,"October 06, 2017","One tire was low when I did the test drive.  They just filed up with air and sent me on the way.  4 days later it was down to 18 pounds.  I was late to an appointment because I had to turn around and get air.  2 days later it was low again.  I took to them to get a new tire since I did not want to have a new car with a patched tire. They wanted to only patch it.  But they could fine nothing wrong with the tire and rather hinted that I was making it up.  Finally they supposedly checked the rim and it was cracked.  Supposedly put a new rim on from another car and sent me on the way.  I hope when I have tire trouble again, I do not find a patch on that tire. I feel like I was overcharged for the car.  They took advantage of a blond girl.  I tried to refinance when I got home and the bank said the value of the car was $19,200 which Hyundai said it was $27000.

It was made clear that I would not pay any penalties for mileage overages as long as i lease or buy a new Hyundai at the end of my lease (which I plan to do).

I have used Hyundai finance on both of my previous purchases.  Pressured to drive new Santa Fe home that day without insurance. I gave 7, 000 down payment.

58,"March 03, 2017","I was very pleased and impressed with the staff at Hiley Hyundai. They don't play the dealership ""games""  that we have all become so familiar. It takes a little negotiation to arrive at a fair price but, until the entire industry decides to join every OTHER industry and put a firm price tag on their products, I guess we consumers are stuck with this distasteful process.     Fortunately, I am old enough to understand how the game is played and THIS experience was better than any other than any other that I have endured. I suppose this is like saying, ""being hit in the head with a rock is certainly better than being shot in the heart with a pistol"" but, like I said, if you have no other option at least Hiley Hyundai made it an acceptable exercise.    I like the vehicle (I bought a Sonata Sport) and it seems like it will give me good service.

Prior to finalizing our purchase, and after before we became further concerned by this deception, he explained that he ""forgot"" to add a discount and consequently changed the amount to what we negotiated for the sale. When he offered us an ""extended 7 year warranty""  and tried to sell this by highlighting the ""minimal"" additional monthly  cost over seven years; we questioned why  a new car would need an additional warranty and pointed out the warranty was actually only 2 years as the manufacturer provided the warranty for the first five years. We felt a more honest approach would be to call it a ""two year"" extended warranty so we were now on the defensive based on these two issues. Eventually (and over his continual attempts of trying to increase our purchase price), we agreed to finalize at the price we negated with our salesperson.",4.6

100,"June 06, 2016","Saw the car on line and called. Got set up with Cody B. Was very pleased with his approach toward us, not pushy or over barring like most car salesmen are. Car was exactly what we wanted and had all the options except one. No biggie. I do have to say though, I noticed as I looked over the car that the driver side rear well had a small ding in it. I did not notice however that the tire was very damaged. Car was dirty from the bad weather. Cody could not get it washed and detailed for us because it was late. Dealership was to come and get the car from us the next Wed to have a second key fob made and the car detailed if weather permitted. We test drove the car and made a deal. We drove home with it. I took the car on Monday to use a pressure washer on it to knock some of the bad weather dirt off. In doing so I notice that the rear driver side tire had 2 deep gashes and the sidewall beads were damaged. Directly where the wheel ding was. It was obvious that someone had damaged the rim and tire somehow. I took the car to a tire dealer and had it inspected. Was told that this tire should not be driven on in this condition. Major damage and a major blowout could occur at anytime. I had to purchase a new tire to replace it. $102.60 I took photos of the damage while it was still on the car and one could see the damage was exactly where the wheel damage was. We test drove this car one time with Cody B. In the car and we did not have any accident or cause any damage to this wheel. It is obvious this damage occurred before we came to see the car and the dealership over looked it or ignored it. I sent the photos to Cody B. and he replied immediately and said he was showing these photos to his used car manager. He wrote back and said his used car manager said it did not happen while they had the car because it would not hold pressure. Uhh it was still holding pressure but was a blowout or a serious accident waiting to happen. This was verified with a local tire shop inspection. The reply was very quick and obviously someone at the dealership turned a blind eye to a serious problem. This damage was on the wheel already. I even pointed out the wheel ding to Cody B. Before we test drive the car. A blowout did not occur, luckily, but the tire was so damaged that it could have blown on anyone at any time. That is my only negative about our purchase. The car overall was a very good buy. Cody B. Is a young and very laid back type of car salesman and does have a future in this business with his demeanor and his professionalism. I cannot say anything good about the used car managers reaction and his clarification. I don't think I even met this manager while there making this purchase. I was not even looking at the ding on the wheel so much. It is minor and however the damage occurred it did not damage the high dollar chrome rim at all. The tire took the brunt of the damage and was clearly a hazard for anyone at anytime. Even if we had not purchased the car it could have been a possible ugly mess for anyone driving it at anytime. Compensation for a tire replacement was all I was really expecting. Most dealerships replace tires on used cars when it is called for and this one tire should have been a priority to be replaced before it was put up for sale. I know my trade was in top notch condition when I did this purchase and whoever buys my trade is getting a very well maintained car with no damage or hazards waiting to happen.",3.8

125,"March 18, 2016","I should have left the dealership when I walked in the door and the salesman Kyle Clark shook the hand of my boyfriend but failed to acknowledge me until I announced I would be the one purchasing the vehicle. 

Lie #1 – Kyle Clark stated the vehicle had been on the lot for more than 90 days and it was required by “law” to send it to auction the next day. This was simply a stupid tactic to put pressure on the buyer. 

I drove 4 Hours from Houston and then another hour from where I was staying in Frisco to view the car in Burleson. 

After two days of negotiation I agreed to purchase a used 2015 Genesis for $15,500 down and $260 monthly payment.  

After I had begun the purchase process Kyle Clark informed me I would only receive one key for the vehicle and I would be required to pay an additional $300 if I wanted a second key. Car purchases should always come with 2 keys

In order to secure a better interest rate for my first vehicle purchase I asked to put my Father as a co-signer on the loan. The paperwork printed showed my father as owner of the vehicle. They never met my father through the purchase nor talked to him. 

LIE #2 – Vance Bailey (Finance Manager) and Kyle Clark both stated it was “law” for my father to be a co-owner on the vehicle title if he’s a co-signer on the loan. This is not true. I verified this was incorrect through other dealerships, lawyer and google search. 

On my 3rd day returning to the dealership and more than 8 hours of driving between Frisco and Burleson they agreed to revise the paperwork and remove my father as an owner of the vehicle. 
.
LIE #3 – When the “revised” paperwork printed I reviewed the numbers and found they had slightly increased the monthly payment from the original agreement. They also increased the financing period by 2 months from the original agreement. Kyle Clark had agreed to match my $500 increase in my down payment during negotiations, but this was not reflected on the new contract. 

I emailed the GM, Seth Boutin regarding several of these pending issues the evening before my 3rd visit. Seth Boutin never replied to my email. I was informed Seth was present at the dealership when I returned, but the coward never came out to address me. 

I asked for my check back and left without buying a car from those idiots.

Was great, personable, attentive and found what I wanted in a reasonable amount of time. The finance On the other hand, was a totally different story. Vance, kept talking to me like an idiot and directing everything to my husband. When I was the one making the purchase. When we declined the additional warranty it only seemed to get worse. Eddy was great and I hope the best for him, if I could have finished my transaction with him I would have been completely satisfied, but as far as my entire experience I cannot recommend this dealer.

Ron, my salesman, apologized multiple times for the misunderstanding and was very helpful in the process of finding me a new car. I was able to leave with a car I wanted and was very happy with my experience.
I was very impressed with Ron as a salesman and would happily work with him again and recommend him to others.
