2,"June 02, 2020","Date line 5/22/2020 I called about a 2016 CPO Ford Escape that Grapevine Ford had advertised. Was contacted immediately and they went through their spill about how if I would fill out a credit app they would come of the price $500 even though I had told them is was a cash deal. Was told they are not a front of house dealership and did not do cash discounts. Now I was quoted $18,800+- for the car they had advertised for $16500.  I asked for an explanation and the oh so smart salesman said it included some anti theft gimmick that was $500 plus and an extra key that was $500 plus because there was only one with the car, also ttl for Oklahoma that he said was required by them to include at 4 1/2 %, which I knew was a lie. There was still $700 dollars difference in their so called out the door price, come to find out he had also tried to include dealer finance fees or some other nonsense. Finally he says $16,183.33 which I agreed to and made sure it would include a 2nd key which magically appeared while on the phone. He said ""i have it right here in my hand."" So, reluctantly, I agree to drive down the next morning and meet at 9 am and if everything checks out would make the deal. I should have known better! Get there and drive the car which was advertised as having lane assist and the brake assist and back up alarms all features that I wanted for my daughter. Thought it was me and that I had not activated features so, when I returned to dealer and asked how to activate. He gets in and fumbles around not saying anything except let me printout the window sticker and he took off to his office, brought it back and started off on how rare this gem of a car was to have traction control?!? I asked again about the 
lane assist and other safety features. He says oh, this car does not have those features, they are only available on 2020 models! I said your internet ad states that it does, so he tells me, ""Well I dont write those ads."" 
Then totally exasperated I walk out as he is saying ""We have 2020's."" Wow, what a piece of work, I am stunned that dealerships like this exist and this was my first and last experience with Grapevine Ford. I have always bought from Huffines in Corinth Classic in Sherman and always treated with respect and make transparent deals. Oh, and he also said they have the lowest priced dealer ad ons in the metroplex, bragging rights??? Part of the double talk I have  left out for times sake that were just as bogus as the rest. Anyway, buyer beware as they always say! Not going to mention the assistant sales managers name, but you know who you are, I was not your sucker customer of the day.  Buyer's please know what you are getting into on these deals, always ask for a full disclosure of fees and there close to 100% profit add ons are a hoax.
 The absolute worst part of this is they have these huge floor displays of the 10 rules of ethics, yeah right! By the way, those $500 keys are usually around $200 retail at honest dealerships and can be had all day online for $100.

3,"May 28, 2020","We stopped buy after shopping around for a new suv and found one here we liked, this was on Monday still was trying to negotiate the price but once we decided we contacted the sale rep and he told us he was holding it while we ran our credit. Once credit was run it came back approved but the interest offered was 6.99 and I called my credit union and they got me at 3% after sending the pre approval told him done deal we will come next day to which was yesterday to sign contracts.  We were set to come out that evening and then get a call me to tell me they sold it.  Are you kidding me you run our credit the day before and we agreed on the deal to tell me you sold it. This is such poor business.  Now my credit has been run and I have no car!!!! Never will I shop here again or recommend you guys!! We we were so patient with you guys since y’all were so busy Monday and didn’t even complain that we didn’t get the time with anyone  we made it easy for you guys and then you pull this BS!!! Now you want to show me another SUV that’s not even close to what we want really that’s doesn’t make it right!! Beware of GRAPEVINE  FORD!!!  ",1.0

9,"April 14, 2020","This dealership should be shut down. My experience buying a vehicle here was one of the worst of my life. We were drawn to them by the USAA Car Buying Service and couldn't have been more misled throughout the process. They claimed they didn't have any of the vehicles we were asking about in stock and then tried to get us in another, more expensive option. Then as we were walking out they all the sudden found the vehicle we had inquired about. They are all HIGH PRESSURE, HIGH STRESS, and HIGH TENSION sales folks working for this dealership. After we purchased the vehicle we noticed a small rattle under the car which was touted as brand new. We had to go back four times before anyone would take a look at it and eventually ended up going to another ford dealership where they fixed it in no time. I can't say this enough - STAY AWAY FROM THIS DEALERSHIP. ",1.0

11,"March 30, 2020","I purchased a brand new 2019 Ford F-150 yesterday from Andrew. In my opinion, Andrew went above and beyond expectation (he didn’t have to). I wasn’t expecting anything to happen and I was content with the vehicle I currently had. That being said, Andrew worked extremely hard to make a deal that was good for me and for him.  Nolan added extra support by making the process easy while explaining all the details and different packages for me. This is my third vehicle from grapevine ford and I will continue to do business with them going forward WHEN this virus blows over. Good job guys and keep up the good work!",5.0

I would highly recommend him to people I know. Mr. Gobea the finance guy that handled the finance portion was phenomenal as well. There was no pressure from him to add extra items such as tire and wheel protection, or other backend products. He explained what was available and left it at that. I will definitely be a repeat customer.",5.0

17,"February 29, 2020","Any dealership can sell you a used vehicle and say they care about quality, but this one went above and beyond to show me they do care and make sure I was completely satisfied with my purchase. Michael Ellsworth really stepped up to the plate and showed how a great manager handles adversity. I purchased a used truck from them, and the next day it was in the shop. After 10 days of checking in with me daily and doing everything to make my vehicle right, he found a way for me to purchase a different vehicle at the same cost. I’ve never imagined a dealership going to these lengths to keep a customer happy after the sale is completed, but I’m so glad I went to Grapevine a Ford and met Michael. I will definitely recommend him and his dealership to anyone I know in need of a vehicle. ",5.0

31,"December 14, 2019","Short version...I went in to make a deal on a 2019 Hyundai Santa Fe but could not come to an agreement with Garry, mainly because of the $500 Kahu tracking device they supposedly already put on the car (even though they just received the car and it hadn't even been detailed or service) and could not remove. He said it adds value to the car and insurance companies will give discounts for having it. Well I asked my insurance broker and he said most insurance companies do NOT give a discount. My daughter does not need to spend $500 for something that is worthless to her but apparently Grapevine Ford forces on you, period. After spending an hour there Garry said he could come off the price of the car $500 and reduce the cost of the Kahu theft recovery system to $251 and then told me that he couldn't take my deposit money to hold the car anyway, until my daughter got in town. I told them in the beginning that this I was helping my daughter find a car and she wouldn't be in town for another week. Why did he waste an hour of my life if he already knew this! Then a couple of days later Dustin calls me (the original sales manager who wasn't working when I went back the second day to put money down) and asked what he could do to earn my business. I told him all I was asking was to come down $500 (off a $27,500 car by the way) and remove the $500 Kahu system. He told me he would see what he could do and call me back. Well it's been 4 days and he never called back. My daughter will be in town tomorrow to purchase her ""new"" car so we're headed to Austin to purchase basically the same car with a few thousand more miles for $1,300 less. Oh and with no dealer add-ons forced on us!
I would recommend not wasting your time at this dealership, they play the typical games of ""used car salesman"". There were multiple other hardline ""sales tricks"" they tried using but I don't want to write a book. 
And please do not follow up on this review saying how sorry you are, to please call you and tell you more about my horrible experience. My job is not to help you make your sales team better.",1.0
32,"November 28, 2019","Buyer beware! Grapevine Ford is selling a Dealer option they claim cannot be removed. They do not disclose it in the advertised price of the vehicle (upfront). This option is a Spireon product called Kahu that is a vehicle tracker (GPS) device. It is a 3rd party add-on and primarily designed for dealers, not the consumer. Where it gets potentially illegal is they claim it cannot be removed. Yet, the Spireon, Kahu product agreement clearly states the device is NOT a condition to buy the vehicle and will be removed at customers request. Yet, Grapevine Ford is stating it cannot be removed and they are charging a cost, again not disclosed to the consumer until close to the sale. The TX Attorney General and FTC have been notified with proof of a text from one of the sales person.",1.0
33,"November 25, 2019","Date of purchase: Friday 11/22

There is so much to cover and I'm not in the habit of leaving negative feedback, even when mediocre service is tendered.  However in this instance I think that for the sake of future buyers at your dealership I should say something. 

My experience in a nut shell. 
     Pros:  * Brian Rojas was attentive, personable and helpful as my salesperson.
               * The vehicle was in the condition it was advertised as being, and was delivered clean and full of fuel. 

      Cons:
                 * I made it implicitly clear with my salesperson and the sales manager, that I had guaranteed financing with my bank and that this would be treated as a cash deal.  They said they needed my credit information to run a quick check to ensure my information was valid.   I said to the salesperson ""You are not running my credit for financing, correct? He said yes, for sure.""   The new car sales manager Blane Castorena came to talk to me and asked if he could beat the deal my credit union gave me could they try to run my credit for a try.   I said, thank you but no, I did not want my credit pulled again and that I was comfortable staying with my bank.   When I went into financing and signed the documents, I asked for the sales document to give to my credit union, and the finance manager said oh, Blane Castorena told me that if I could beat you rate that you would finance, even though the salesperson disagreed and said that was not the case.  So long story short I went ahead and financed with their bank even though it completely irked me to do so. 
                  * Given the financing fiasco enumerated above, I tried to get insurance on my new car, but none of my finance paperwork shows a lean holder and the agreement to furnish insurance has the loss holder as none.  Had to call my poor sales guy back to chase down the information. 
                  * The car wasn't inspected and I need to go back to the dealership to complete.   

After all of this the finance manager felt really bad and gave me two free oil changes, I was okay and left mostly satisfied, given the not so pleasant experience mentioned above.  So much so that I was talking with a family friend, showing her the car and telling her the deal I got.   She wanted the same deal so I called my sales person back and asked if he could make that happen.  He said he could and we set up an appointment on Monday 11/25. 

I go with my friend to the dealership, and my salesperson said he had a doctors appointment and so he handed us off to another sales person.  Although this was okay, it was not ideal.   The new salesperson was great and we made it work.   I trying to work the same deal, all over again, because of the salesperson change.  All I wanted was the internet advertised price and the two discounts that she qualified for.   They came out with a different price and as you can imagine had questions, the salesperson didn't feel completely comfortable answering all of them, so he went and asked Blane Castorena to come out and explain, yes the same Blane Castorena that outright lied to the finance manager on my deal.   I put that aside and asked him for explanation of each of the numbers, which is within my rights.    He then turned to me and asked are you buying this?   I said no, that my friend was, but that she appointed me as her agent.  He then turned from me to her and said, I'm only going to deal with her because she is the one buying.   So he turned to her started grilling her, and she was panicking, I told him to talk with me and she told him the same.  He then became extremely rude, though back the chair and walked away, I said really?  You're going to treat a customer this way, you're not following your dealerships service credo, will I just need to talk to your manager.   He said ohh I'm so scared, and then when in his glass frame office and when in cover he called me an xxxxxxx!!!

At this point I was furious, I asked my salesmen for Blane's manger and he just grabbed another dude standing in the office, I'm pretty sure it was not the Blane's superior.  The tried to smooth it over, but my friend decided that she did not want to give them her business so we left.   

I'm within my 3-day purchase window and I'm seriously considering taking the car I bought back.  I bought the vehicle for my daughter and already presented it to her, that is the only reason I haven't taken it back, in fear of breaking her heart. 

I'm so very disappointed and when the dealership assessment comes back from Ford, this comment will go in it.   For the sake of future customer's I hope that something comes of this so that Blane Castorena becomes afraid to treat customers like he treated me. ",1.8
34,"October 31, 2019","DON'T GO TO THIS DEALERSHIP. They messed up HARD.   We paid cash for the mustang GT. Left the dealership and they call me saying they need me to come back because some  paperwork went wrong. So I come back, they tell me I need to give them $750 because of a rebate that wasn't suppose to be there. They forgot to take off a rebate and told me I need to pay them $750. Straight up said no and return the car. Never seen such BS happen. They messed up, own up to it. DON'T TELL THE CUSTOMER TO GIVE THEM MONEY FOR THEIR MESS UP. ",1.0
35,"October 22, 2019","I got an appointment online to get my speakers checked because there was a buzzing sound in my driver's side speakers. When I get there Bridget, who was the person I was supposed to see, said that I never scheduled an appointment. When I showed her my conformation see looked it up, then she found me. Then she says that they are behind by 4 days so I will have to leave my car there for 4 days before they even look at it. So I asked Bridget if there was a loner that I could get because I need a car to get to work. She tells me loners are cars that we give to you and you have to bring it back in the same condition that I got it in. I was like that's so rude she was acting like I would not be responsible with a loner, first of all I'm a valet, so I know how to handle others cars with care, and second, I've had a loner before. After all that she says without checking her computer or anything that she doesn't have a loner till next week and set me an appointment for then. I left there so angry, she just waisted my time and I left there with just another appointment. So I called McDavid Lincoln in plano and they gave me an appointment on the same day and when I got there, Ed who is a service associate over there was way nicer than the people at Grapevine, not only did they look at the car the same day, within 2 hours Ed ordered the part and I was on my way home. Ed called me 2 days later saying the part came in and worked with my schedule to get my speakers fixed. If you value customer service DO NOT GO TO GRAPEVINE LINCOLN, they are rude, and the people there dont care about customers.

36,"October 07, 2019","I am partly to blame.  I have purchased 7 new vehicles from this dealership since 2011 and continue to allow the service team on both the Ford & Lincoln side to treat me terribly.  I dropped a car off on 10/01 for a warranty repair of a speaker and Zac-tech treatment scheduled for 10/03.  Was told the car would be ready and delivered to my home shortly after noon on 10/03.  At 1:45 I called and was informed that the speaker was not replaced and that the 3rd party company that does their pickup & drop-off needed 2 hours to execute any service.  This delayed a trip to the TX state Special Olympics Fall Classic in College Station.  I demanded for my car to be placed out front with the keys in it.  Upon arrival I was approached by an employee and told I needed to sign for MY CAR! Just as she said this I notice that the Zac-tech service had not been performed.  I explained that I did not need to sign to get my car and took the key fob and proceeded to my car.  Some knucklehead sales rep informed that he was filming me.  Nice move!  This is just one of over a dozen terrible experiences I have had with service at Grapevine Ford Lincoln.  Don't have the space to write about the time that service department failed to properly replace the fuel filter on my F250, initially refused to replace a screen on my MKZ, and the list goes on...  Do business with these folks at your own peril.  If you're unhappy you can't say I didn't tell you.",1.0
37,"October 02, 2019",Received the absolute best ever customer care/service from Laura Benavides in Ford Service. Had a really bad 1st time experience with Aaron McBride (horrible and worst ever service advisor that knows nothing about his job or cares about the customers) but Laura made it right and had Ford throw in some extras just to make sure I was taken care of. Outstanding. 5 star service and commitment to taking care of the customers. I’m a Ford customer for life now and I’ll only buy and service my trucks from Grapevine Ford. I highly recommend everyone to ask for Laura Hernandez. She is the real deal. Big SALUTE to the technician Joe Gonzales that took care of the work. He’s the man. ,5.0
38,"September 15, 2019","I drove from Lubbock Texas to Grapevine to visit my daughter. When I hit Roanoke, my steering wheel was vibrating and it was happening when stopped and when in parked and idling. Rather than risk it, I made the MISTAKE of going to Grapevine Ford. Rather than address the issue, they decided to hand me a $4300 list of recommended service items. Upon returning to Lubbock (mind you I was worried during the whole 4 1/2 drive), I immediately got brakes and rotors changed. I was told my pads were good for another 30000 miles and I also said that Grapevine Ford said my shocks/struts were leaking. I was told that is a TYPICAL ploy to make a quick $1000! 

Oh and the day I go to pick up the car, Eddie handed me my paperwork and keys. No one offered to get my car!!! The courtesy car wash could have been better done by a bunch of monkeys!

I’ve read enough reviews to know it’s not worth contacting the dealership management as service manager is insulting and belittling.

39,"September 11, 2019","Over a month ago I went into Grapevine Ford after they agreed to purchase my 2011 Ford Explorer for $7000.  I am currently living and working in China, so I asked if it would be possible to do the sale.  I was told by Gus, the manager over purchasing, that it would be possible.  He had me sign some papers, and said that as soon as the title arrived he would send me a check for the amount agreed upon.  Following that, I went to the airport.  A couple weeks after this I learned from the people sending the title that it had been received at Grapevine Ford a week prior.  At this point I called Gus and was told he would be sending me the check via FedEx, and would give me a tracking number.  Several days passed and I had not heard from him.  I contacted him again, and was told that FedEx would not deliver a check.  He told me he would have the comptroller wire the money, so I provided him very sensitive bank information.  Again several days passed with no word, so I contacted Gus.  He told me he had given the comptroller the information and that he believed they had sent it.  Several days later there was nothing sent to the bank, so I contacted Jennifer James, the comptroller directly.  I was only able to reach her voicemail, and after several attempts decided this was a dead end.  I finally reached Gus again, and was told that they were unable to wire the money.  He told me they had sent the check via USPS, but he does not have the tracking number.  He told me he would get the tracking number and send it to me today.  This has not happened, and I am now filing this, believing that I have had my car basically stolen and sold by this dealership.  ",1.0

42,"August 29, 2019","The car buying experience was fast and smooth. After buying new cars the past 24 years I would say this was the first time I didn’t feel ripped off. 
I had to return the following week for the tint to be put on since their tint guy was off when I purchased it. A tire sensor was out as well. I got there before 9am and was given a loaner. I went to mall and came out to two police cruisers by the loaner. The salesman didn’t put a temporary tag on and police had called dealership and was told it was missing. After that was straightened out I went back to dealership and ended up waiting until 5pm for a tint and sensor replacement. 
Returned today for the 6 month reapplication of the ZAKTEK paint protection. They have a 2 to 3 week wait time for it so you need to schedule an appointment a few weeks in advance. When you work 6 days a week with the occasional weekday off, how do you schedule that?",2.8
43,"August 11, 2019","First and foremost, let me start out by saying before visiting Grapevine Ford I visited and spoke with several other dealerships. One I visited in person and was treated very poorly for someone who was attempting a 60 thousand dollar plus transaction. I was about to give up and just keep my truck when I placed an inquiry on cars.com from Grapevine Ford. I received a call from Chris Aylesworth internet sales manager from Grapevine. I let him know what I had been going through and he instantly gained rapport with me. I instantly clicked with him and even left work early to go meet him the day I enquired. I can tell you that any customer including myself can get nervous making such a large purchase even for someone that is also in the car business like myself. I purchased my DREAM CAR its a huge, huge investment for me and I needed someone that I could trust. I won't go on to much longer but if you are in the market for a Truck, Car, or SUV give Grapevine Ford and Chris Aylesworth your time, and they will invest it knowing that your time is valuable. They were honest, up front and transparent with me. I can't stand when someone tries to lie or beat around the bush. THANK YOU I really, really appreciate everything you did for me Chris! Last but not lease I purchased The BRAND NEW Explorer ST..... it is hands DOWN the most refined vehicle I have ever driven. If you are in the market for a luxury SUV you would be selling yourself short if you did NOT check out the New Explorer. I am absolutely in love with my new truck (suv). I have owned a F-150 since the day I turned 16, this is my first time not having an actual truck but my Explorer does not make me miss having a truck at all. Extremely satisfied!! Go check out the Explorer, Grapevine Ford and Chris Aylesworth, they will not disappoint! 
Also I would also like to thank Jake in F&I as well for getting my deal done, I know he worked extremely hard on the back end to get what I was wanting accomplished! ",5.0

We made an appointment over a week in advance.  The day before we received a call from a young lady informing us we would have to reschedule as no loaner cars were available.  We rescheduled for the following Monday only to receive another call stating a loaner would not be available that day either.  Since we were getting ready for an extended trip, I had to bring the car in anyway.  I waited 2 hours only to find parts needed to be ordered and I would have to bring the car back.  I did get a loaner the next time and all went well.  Once again, this bad experience had nothing to do with Miguel who was very helpful and apologetic.",4.0

106,"June 01, 2019","Can I give zero stars? If Ford ever wondered why they are losing brand value to the Japanese brands I have the reason. I’ve purchased three Toyota’s in 18 years and have put over 400K miles on them. I decided to purchase a NEW truck for the first time ever. I settled on the nearly 80K Ford Raptor as a 40th present to myself. At 6000 miles I started having oil pressure issues and transmission issues. The dealer I purchased it from said I should bring it in. I did that at 8,000 miles. I brought it in and must say that Grapevine Ford must be the worst service organization. The service group was lightly staffed on that day and had to search for someone to give my truck to.  The two service managers were not around, but I grabbed their cards. I left messages with both of them. One never called me back and the other’s VM says it’s broken so I need to text him, which I did. While I was waiting around I asked for some water and was told “there is a water fountain inside.” No attempts to say “let me go get that or offer a bottle water.” No attempts to go the extra mile when I clearly have major issues. The manager and I spoke on Monday and when I asked him about a loaner his response was “Did you buy that with the warranty?” Wow! Didn’t realize I needed to do that as I never bought a new car and quite frankly never had an issue with one of the Toyota’s in all those years. I would expect that you spend $80K on a car that would be the least they would do when it’s determined I have  head gaskets and transmission issues four months after purchase. I Ubered for a week and had great customer service. Upon picking it up on Friday I got in to find they had driven it for about 40 miles based on the paperwork. Did they fill it up with gas after making the repairs? Nope. Did they even wash it with all the dirt from having service guys all over it. No again. I asked about it and the response was astounding. “If you were my customer I would have made sure it was washed.” Really? So, the 80K I spent at Ford doesn’t constitute me as your customer. Ford just doesn’t get it. Fact is I WAS your customer, but will never return to Grapevine Ford let alone purchase another Ford.",1.8

137,"April 30, 2019","Have two ford vehicles, one purchased at Grapevine Ford.  Since it is the closest Ford dealer to me, I have always taken both cars to them for anything and everything.  My hope was that I would be working with trustworthy people that won't try and take advantage of me, in hopes I'll buy my future vehicles here.  That was my plan. 

Check engine light came on my truck, inside my 100k mile warranty.  Without getting a call, I received my inspection results via email survey type thing called AutoPoint.  There were 9 items totaling $2,700.  In order to see the second item, you had to either accept or decline the first item (worth $650).. all while my truck is with them.  Imagine clicking ""Accept"" on 9 items totaling $2,700 in order to see all of the items they've suggested.  

I took this exact list (who knows if I even needed all 9 items) to a highly rated auto service nearby.  These 9 items totaled $750 there.  

I was in every other month and there were many people who I thought I developed a relationship with and could trust.  However, it is very disappointing to me that I cannot continue to take my Ford vehicles to my nearest Ford dealer because they are focused on sales instead of service.  I hope one day their model will change to become more service based.  Big bummer having to break up with them. ",1.4

I told him I had to be back in a couple of weeks and we could discuss it then, but he continued to push and refused to accept my answer. He told me my oil change was free because I had paid for the MPP Care Coverage (which I still have the paperwork for), then turned around and charged me $38 for it. I was also charged $24.50 for ""customer pay environmental disposal fees for repair order,"" when I did not have any repairs done, and had already been charged separately for the tire disposal. They also did not document the required ""DOT number"" on all four of my tires for the extra protection I had purchased, despite charging me for it on the previous page. I was barely even given enough time to see where I needed to sign before they were rudely rushing me out the door.

142,"April 22, 2019","Update - I received a call from Jason on Tuesday. He apologized for not calling sooner. We had a nice conversation about the broken part, etc. I am changing my rating from one star to four.

If Grapevine Ford’s service department breaks something on your car, don’t expect to hear from them again.

After using another Ford dealership for twelve years, I thought I’d try Grapevine Ford to service my 1992 Cougar, a car for which it is difficult to find some parts. Grapevine Ford’s service seemed OK the first time around when they mainly replaced some front end parts for over $2400. Jason’s final text communication did seem a bit abrupt, however. Then, the following week, a small part fell loose from the front of the car.

I returned to the dealership a few weeks later to address the front end part that fell loose and to install a door lock switch. I also wanted to take a look at the right door latch which was missing a small foam seal. Was it inside the door? Could they get a new one? Jason looked and saw where it was missing.

The next day, the plastic surrounding the door latch was loose, apparently broken. Jason looked at it, went to find the technician and retuned to say he had left for the day. Jason told me he would call me the next day. Not hopeful they would be able to replace the plastic part, I was reassured by Jason’s promise to call me; I would at least hear whether the technician wanted to take responsibility. And I would hear whatever their policy is pertaining to the situation.

When I got home, I texted Jason with a link to the part on eBay, in case the information was helpful to him in any way - showing the value and availability of the part.

The following day (Saturday), no call from Jason. I texted again and called and left a voice mail asking whether Jason was able to speak to the technician. No reply. I texted again, saying that I had left a voice mail. No reply.

One would think that with the dealership having your email address and phone number with text capability, communication would be great. The only thing I got from Jason were their regular canned texts - “…the satisfaction with your current service experience is important…,” “…thank you for trusting us with your vehicle…,” “…please answer one simple question about your satisfaction…,” “…take 30 seconds and tell us about your experience…”

OK, well, you asked for reviews…First, I found Stephanie Maggio’s email address to briefly describe my experience prior to writing this review. I sent her a screen shot of my texts and the canned responses. She promptly answered (on Sunday), thanked me for contacting her “…before filling out the survey…” and said she would forward my email to their service manager “…so that he is aware of what is happening.”

The following day, no call or any other response. So I can only imagine what their company policy is in this situation. Apparently, it’s just to dismiss the customer’s concerns and completely cease communication. 

The broken plastic part and how to make repairs is not really important in this situation. I was able to glue it. If it comes apart again, I can find a replacement.

The problem is the lack of communication. Here are some suggestions for Jason and his service manager to consider for the future - 

Call the customer and say, “I’m sorry that we broke your interior part. It’s our policy to not do anything else for you. Have a good day.”

Or, “I’m sorry. We don’t think we broke the part and we can’t help you further.”

Or, “I’m sorry that we broke your part. We want to give you $5.00 off on your next oil change.”

Use your imagination; there are many possibilities.

My plan at this point is to return to the Ford dealership I previously used for twelve years to service the Mustang I bought from them. Maybe I’ll take a look at their inventory to see whether they have another one.",3.4

188,"February 06, 2019","I believe in honesty and sharing information that feel ppl should have and make their own judgements and save themselves problems later. 
We have owned 4 Ford Expeditions and like Ford.  We purchased our last Ford from Grapevine Ford and thus continued going to them for our service.  We had an incident a couple of years ago where we were told by service that we needed something that it turns out we DID NOT.  We brought the supposed problem to be evaluated at another Ford dealership and we were told the problem didn't exist. After alot of time and energy Grapevine Ford admitted their wrong and made it right, but I put a high emphasis on alot of work to make them accept responsibility of wrong doing (down right unethical in my opinion).       In May I brought my car in for a oil change and left with an estimate of over $5500 of recommended things.  

Recently our son brought his car in for an oil change and he was told by the advisor that is tie end rods were in critical need of repair and recommended he fix them right then. My husband was called and he determined he needed to get another opinion.  Two mechanics looked at the vehicle and determined that there was no problem with tie end rods. We met with the tech, advisor and supervisor to have the vehicle put up on rack and the tech put his hands on tires and said see they are bad. We asked him to do it at the brand new car next to his car which was also up on rack and it looked exactly the same.  They had every opportunity to back step and admit it was a incorrect call and didn't  We went and talked to the person that was involved in my expedition and he said let me look at and I said the car is gone but we will have one more mechanic look at it and then call him  Another mechanic looked at it and said the tie end rods are tight and fine and wouldnt recommend anything be done because nothing needed to be done. A call was made to the second person and the GM of the dealership. We never received any call back. Not one.  I called and talked to the second supervisor and all he said was well thanks for calling and bye.  Sad that a dealership has such little regard for morals and ethical behavior.",1.0

Grapevine Ford had the car that I wanted, but when I told them what I was willing to pay I was told that they would see what they could do and call me the next day.  They never called me the next day.
I called back and asked why I hadn't been called back about the deal I was asking for. I didn't get an answer, just an apology and promise to call back later.  Again, no call back.  When I called again to ask why I hadn't been called back I was told that the car had been sold to someone else so they didn't call me. It seemed like they were stalling until they could sell the car to someone else for their asking price.  Then they wanted me to come back to look at other vehicles.  I reluctantly told them I would the next day.  In the meantime I got online and found what I wanted at another dealership. I went there the next morning and did a test drive. They were willing to make the deal I wanted if I would purchase the car before I left. I left there as the owner of the new car that I wanted.
Grapevine Ford's asking price for the car I wanted was less than the one at the other dealership. They didn't want to take my offer, but the other dealership made my deal even though their car was priced higher than the one at Grapevine Ford.

This came about after I had an internet price and they tried to quote it $3,000 higher, I called them on it and they began making excuses.  Continue to get emails after I requested NO MORE and so I called them out again on their deceptive practices.

213,"August 24, 2018","HORRIBLE!   Fix Or Repair Daily.   These guys are absolutely horrible!   NO - REPEAT - NO Customer service what so ever!

Status:  2014 Ford Explorer - brought in THREE times in 6 months for various problems.  Each time swore I wouldn't be back.

First time - Axle issue - took more than two weeks, and NO communication.   I had to constantly call.  When finally done, I go to pick it up and the LOST MY KEYS!   Had to wait an extra day!

Second time - Transmission issue - took more than Seven Days, NO communication, I had to constantly call for updates.   I go to pick it up, and they CAN'T FIND THE CAR.  I waited 45 minutes before they brought it up.   Got it home, rear view camera doesn't work.

Third & Final - Camera and Battery issue.  Booked a 7am appointment, there on time - took the car, and again by 5pm I had to call for status, to be told need another day.   Next day, given diagnosis - Two year old battery, still under warranty - told need new one, but not covered under warranty.  Camera went ""bad"" need a new one - total bill $1100!   I pushed back on warranty for both, and gave the most illogical excuse I ever heard.  As if I were stupid!  Bob (service rep) directly was offensive (apologized later). I said don't do work, I'll come get it.  I go to pick up....waited 20 minutes for them to find BOB just to hand me my keys.   

Spoke to Vinny, the Service Manager, he preferred to argue with me rather than try to make a bad - err, worse situation better.   He further insulted my intelligence.   Actually spoke DOWN to me!   Horrible.

Have a daughter who will be 16 in 3 months, will be in the market for a new car - NOT FROM GRAPEVINE FORD!  In fact, selling Explorer, and NO LONGER A FORD CUSTOMER!

219,"July 24, 2018","Foremost, even if you choose to go to this dealership after you read my review, DO NOT sign the arbitration clause if you buy a car as part of your agreement. It was an unbelievably terrible experience at the dealership from the receptionist to the salesperson to the manager level personnel. We negotiated a good price on a truck and agreed to buy the vehicle and after all paperwork done and downpayment given (with trade-in), they refused to give the truck to us. I think it was because they either sold it ""again"" to someone else or we did not buy any additional services like insurance from them. 

They played games and told us to come back the next day to pick up the truck. We go at 11am time which was given and it was in ""detail"" so we waited and one guy came and said there was confusion so to come later in the afternoon at 1pm and the truck will be out of detail and ready for pickup. We go at 3 pm and still the truck is not ready and they claim it is going to go in detail. So obvious reaction is frustration. A manager called us in and yelled at us in her office and said to get out of dealership and they won't give us the truck. We called the cops however it is a civil case. 

We hired an attorney to enforce the agreement both parties already signed however they cancelled our loan without our permission and said the contract was null and void. Also, the arbitration clause in the agreement ceases your right to sue them for this cheating and scam. 

After this incident, we just went and bought a truck at the 5 star ford in north Richland hills and they have excellent service and no arbitration clause when you buy a vehicle. That just tells you they are honest and not scamsters and cheaters like this dealership. WE spoke with at least 5-6 individuals in our own network who had the same terrible experience and went somewhere else to buy. Even a well-known Bedliner company LineX shop guy said they get so many customers who claim terrible things about this dealership.

224,"June 22, 2018","The worst experience dealing with people and a dealership in my life. Horrible customer service, reluctant to acknowledge mistakes and take responsibility, unprofessional communication, or none at all from sales to management. Purchased a ""supposed"" Certified Pre-Owned 2014 Mustang on May 11, 2018 and have regretted it ever since. I was expecting the 172-point inspection to give me assurance of a reliabile, mostly damage free, vehicle with low mileage. Not at all what I received. Every negative issue with vehicle was the ""previous owner's fault or doing"", as stated by management. After certifying a vehicle by, and for, Ford, I am concerned by the issues that would not have passed even my inspection, that passed and qualified this vehicle to be a CPO vehicle. I purchased vehicle from dealership not previous owner, so if there were discrepancies or issues not up to Grapevine Ford 'standards', they should have been corrected before selling it, period. This vehicle was purchased for a graduation present for son, but I have not been able to give to him because of these & other issues. It has now been at dealership for a 7 days, when I was given a 3-4 day status that included a weekend. Do you think anyone had the common courtesy to provide me an update? No, and when I call for an update, 
I get a 'smug' attitude and a statement, 'Okay, if you want me to call and say there's no information, then I'll call and say there's no information"". I guess he gets the smugness from his boss who had previously stated,  he needed to hurry up and get my car fixed, cause he couldn't sell the 'loaner' with me driving it. Wow...and they wonder why people complain about their dealership. Sir, I have no interest in driving a Ford Fusion, period. We are here, because your dealership has failed in doing its' job. The sale of MY VEHICLE is in question and should be your priority to get it right, NOT the sale of a 'loaner'. Someone, if not the subordinate, who feels after a week that there's no information to provide ,should have called me after they realized it was going to take longer than promised/told; definitely before I called them (7 days later). Also, especially since my issues were treated as trivial when I brought it in. I was now being provided with ""information"" that my car isn't ready, and is still on the first issue to be corrected. So, I guess my plans don't matter? That 'no information' is now infringing on my family vacation, college, and other summer plans. I REALLY JUST WANT MY MONEY BACK AND THEY CAN KEEP IT. I NEVER WANT TO DEAL WITH THEM EVER IN LIFE. I DON'T WANT THE WARRANTY THERE EITHER. 
I have patiently tried to resolve issues (4 emails so far) even with Sr. management, with no response or phone call from them either. I was finally able to make an appt. with Tracy, Asst. GM., after not being able to communicate professionally with a Mr. Kaba in finance. (horrible). After an hour long conversation with her, I was so stressed out that I had to go to emergency room and cancel that next day appt. Even though she was able to communicate with me in a professional tone and manner, the many issues with vehicle including: no CPO paperwork provided as of yet, no signed contract received at dealership on day of signing, lack of respect or acknowledgement to previous emails and concerns, & providing a huge cash down payment for the vehicle, and the feeling of being taken advantage of by finance, I had a serious panic/anxiety attack after speaking with her. How hard is it for salesman/designated employee to call customer and see if they are happy with purchase or have issues? How hard is it to respond to an email or forward email  to someone who can/does respond and RESOLVE issues? How hard is it to update customer w/status of vehicle that will take longer than stated? How hard is it to not belittle, downtalk, or make satirical comments to customer and remain professional? I was also told, ""I will have Tracy give you a shout"". A shout?? Is this a professional place of business??
Such a Beautiful dealership, but it's just a cover for the ""ugliness"" waiting for you inside. BUYER BEWARE!! If I was the owner, I would definitely be embarrassed and very disappointed in my team.",1.6

 I had to get a neighbor to take me to pick it up and take it elsewhere, where it was looked at immediately, and was only the battery, and was fixed immediately.

I was in the market looking for a Mustang GT and the salesperson I spoke on the phone wasn't available when I reached, so another one took over. Anyways, I knew what I wanted and I told him I wanted a GT with the 401A package/Shaker Audio/Driver Memory Seat. The person went and got another person just to tell me ""Mustangs don't come with power seats"". I was shocked that they didn't know their own cars and this is a Ford dealership. Well from there he went on to challenge me to show him a Mustang with power seats. I was surprised but kept calm and told him that I test drove a car at a different dealership with the specs. He still refused and was rude. So, I showed him one online. No apologies, nothing. He was like ""Huh, so they have it."" That's it. It is one thing to not know you vehicles, whole another level to be rude and not apologize afterwards, especially when it was your mistake. That made me realize how tough it would be to deal with them after I got the car. So, I didn't discuss any further and left. None of the 3 salespersons tried to talk to me or anything. I'm better off taking my money to a good dealership.
Well, you would want to make a large ticket purchase only at a reputed dealer with good and courteous sales people, so my advice - ""STAY AWAY"". There are a lot of Ford dealers in DFW that can give you a better service than here on any day.",1.2

257,"January 29, 2018","Seriously worst dealership I ever had to deal with! I know going to a dealership is usually not a fun experience and they all want to get as much money out of you as possible but this place is by far the worst. First off they put amazing prices on their website for vehicles and once you call or actually go to the dealership to check it out the car is either "" just sold this past week"" or they will make up a fee and add a ridiculous amount of money to it. Oh and if your wanting to trade your car in, don't expect to get anything Kelly Blue Book, NADA, or any other online website thinks the trade in value is. Apparently they just make their own price up for that too. So, I went in there to take a look at a new 2018 mustang and trade my 2014 mustang in which has 55,000 miles, only been washed by hand, only used royal purple oil for oil changes, and I put close to $1,000 into it putting custom leather seat covers in it, adding weather tech floor mats, and tinted the windows with a lifetime guarantee. They wanted to give me $8,500 for trading it in. I told the sales rep I looked it up on Kelly Blue Book and it says the trade in value is $11,059 not including the money I put in it. He said KBB is a western company and that they use NADA. So, I looked up the NADA trade in value. The NADA clean trade in value is $11,575. Then, I was talking to a sales manager trying to negotiate a price and I told him about the NADA trade in value, and no joke he tells me they don’t use NADA to look at trade in values, they use this other website. I can’t remember what that site was called. To make this story short, we couldn't come to agreement on the trade in or the final price of the car. Two days later, I look online and find a New 2018 Ford Raptor at the same dealership for $51,080. Amazing price right! So when I called them and tried to see if they still have it in stock and see what the price was, the person I talked to said there was not any sale reps in the dealership at the moment and they would call me back as soon as one comes in. This was at 8:15 am they open at 7:00 am. That seemed kind of fishy to me.  So I had a friend of mine call them 5 minutes later, and guess who answers, a sales rep. He told my friend the vehicle is in stock, but you need to add a $10,000 fee to the MSRP sticker price, so the final price is $61,000. 45 minutes later a female sales rep gave me a call. This sales rep said the vehicle is in stock but you have to add $15,000 to the MSRP sticker price. I said why do you have to add $15,000? And no lie, she stuttered and actually took a while to come up with an excuse as to why they add that much to it. She then asked me if I wanted to come see it and I said I only wanted to come see it if I can get it for the price you advertised on your website. She then said, “Ya we can’t sell it to you for that price"". I then texted the sticker for the vehicle to the sales rep I talked to about the mustang. He texted me back saying, ""yes that vehicle is in stock"". I then texted him if he wanted to sell a truck today and sell me for the price on their website and on the sticker then I will come up there and purchase it that day. You probably guessed it he never texted me back. So if you want some advice, I would not go to this dealership. All they do is play games, make up numbers, and try to screw people over. If you see a good price online for this dealership just add a minimum of $10,000 to it and that’s the real price. Also, I would never trade my car into this place. Expect to get a couple thousand dollars less than what the trade in value should be.",1.4

The truck was FILTHY inside and out and there was wax residue all over the plastic wheel trim which is a pain in the butt to clean off.  I was told the tires were in great shape.  LIE!!!!!!!!!!!  They are dry rotted and cracked and I have to replace them.  These are all costs that shouldn't have happened and this dealership completely LIED to me about it all.  I will NEVER consider them again, pass on my story to the whole area down there to warn them and am going to explore any legal action I can take (doubt there is any, but will still explore).

Have been in for numerous recalls & each time they say its fixed .... & had to  go back 6 times over the span of a yr to finally fix just one of the recalls/ problem.  Darren, the service advisor  BS's each time & says it's fixed when you know damm well it's not.....& the service manager Clarence is even worse - Has a Hillbilly bad attitude from the start. Took car in around a month ago because the needle went to red/overheating & brought it in to have fixed & concern for the the overheating defective sensor ""recall"" . They did ""their test"" & said everything was ""OK"" - ABSOLUTE BS - & their so called solution was to top off the fluid. Told Darren that was BS & told him your not fixing the root cause & said I know it's going to do the exact same thing - sure enough, just over a month, exact same thing happens!!! Have it towed back.  Service manager Clarence (with bad attitude) says it would cost me $600 to fix..... & that apparently my car was just fine when I brought it in last month - that I had just brought it in for the recall & it tested OK...... & apparently Darren  lied & said I just brought it in for the recall, & not because the car was overheating - Absolute Bullxxxxttt liar !!

Once we had our car serviced there, we stopped going anywhere else because of the responsive of the service department.  We purchased a pre-owned F150 in March and then just a week ago, we found ourselves needing another car unexpectedly.  To say we were not in the mood to buy a car would be an understatement.  So I am pleasantly surprised to be reporting that we had an excellent experience purchasing a pre-owned 2017 Ford Escape.  Ty Young and Carver Rademacher went above and beyond!  They were flexible, professional and friendly throughout the process.  My husband and I both have odd work schedules and they worked with us to get this all done without complaint.  We were unsure as to what model we wanted to buy and they never complained when I asked to test drive the first, second, or third different model.  We were already customers of Grapevine Ford but Carver and Ty have strengthened that relationship.  We could not have asked for a better experience and would recommend working with either of them when buying a car. ",5.0

We knew we had limited time to search for a car, test drive, and make a decision due to work schedules, childcare, and upcoming travel, and we started our day-long search at Grapevine Ford. When we walked in, we were immediately greeted by Matthew (Matt) Bradshaw, and we can't say enough good things about him or the dealership. Matt was incredibly personable, knowledgeable, and patient. He listened as we anxiously described our situation, asked poignant questions to determine how best he could help us, and identified a couple different cars (also on our list we hadn't shared with him yet) that would be good fits for us. He then helped gave an opportunity to test drive 3 cars without EVER acting like we were wasting his time (an encounter we expected after visiting other dealers previously), and in fact, he found great ways to connect with us to make the experience personal and informative. Frankly speaking, we felt like we found a trusted friend in the car industry, and we hope we can work with Matt in the future. We will recommend him, and Grapevine Ford, to any of our friends and family looking for a vehicle. Thanks, Matt 2.0!

First I had cracked windshield with 75 miles on new 2016 f150 so took it to service department to see if it was covered under warranty...it wasn't, but the bad part was the fact that no one greeted me, I had to go inside where no one came to see what I was there for, I finally found a service person in a cubicle talking with another service person about a personal issue and they acted as if I was putting them out by asking for their assistance. When I took my truck to Five Star Ford for a second opinion at least someone greeted me when I pulled in and immediately got someone to help me.
   Second time, I only went back because I had a coupon, was for an oil change and tire rotation. I had an appointment, but they said still a two hour wait when I arrived. I specifically asked if they top off the fluids and yes was the answer. I was checking oil two days later and saw the washer fluid was almost dry and I hadn't used any, so they didn't top off. Then a tire showed to be low and after some airing up of the tire and some logical reasoning I figured out that the display for tire pressures was not showing correct tire to be low...they had not reset the display when rotating tires...I went to Discount tire and they took care of it.

Mid-way my engine light came on, so I stopped at a dealership. They gave me an all-clear to get to Ft. Woth; however, they to9ld me to go to a certified Lincoln dealership before driving back to New Braunfels, Texas. My family drove me to Grapevine Ford Lincoln. I dealt with a certain man who was polite and courteous. He advise me to leave my Lincoln Town car which I did. It might be good to mention I have a bumper to bumper warranty.; however, I digress. The man called me later that day and told me this and that needed to be done. I was also told it would take three days to accomplish tasks. Then a few days later I was told the car was ready. I was driven back to the dealership and presented with a bill of $2,000.00. I almost choked. I wrote a check and left. I did not even drive the car during the week I remained in Ft. Worth. After a week's visit, I began to drive back to New Braunfels. I was half way there when the engine began to clatter. In addition, I noticed that my 20mpg gas mileage had dropped to 17 mpg. I phoned Grapevine and spoke to the same man. He told me I would have to return the car...some 450 miles... for them to correct issues. Instead I drove to a friend who owns the Goodyear store. His people could not find out what the Grapevine mechanics had done wrong. I presented him with the spread sheet I had been given. He then went to his computer, retrieved my complete file and said to me...""You were hosed by the Grapevine dealership."" He then meticulously went over each item showing me he had just recently done the very same work items. My health has declined considerably; however, I can advise the dealership that I intend to write a certified letter to Mr. Carl Sewel whom I believe owns that dealership. If anyone reads this and is concerned, they may have the general manager contact me personally to refund every single cent of my transaction. I do not intend to speak with anyone other than the overall dealership manager... or Mr. Sewel If I do not hear anything within ten days, a certified letter will be sent to the owner/partners.

She assured me that would be no problem. Our appointment was made with Frank. We arrived Thursday morning and Frank advised us that the AC dept was running behind. Why would we be scheduled if the AC dept was behind already?? Explained the problem to Frank and he felt it was probably a very simple solution due to a faulty wire.

323,"June 22, 2017","If you have a Ford, the service department at Grapevine Ford (""GVF"") is second to none!  I have had service at three other dealerships in the DFW metroplex and was left unhappy with each and every one of the three. One of them tried to convince me I needed almost $3K in non-warranty work done...to a very expensive SUV that was only a year old...hello?

In January of 2017 I tried GVF's service department...and have been nowhere else since.  This review might be a little 'wordy', but you really need to read it to appreciate the experience you will experience if you try GVF's service or dealership.

My 2014 4WD SUV is still under warranty, but even when non-warranty repairs are needed, GVF has never tried to over-sell me or convince me things needed to be repaired/purchased that were not truly needed.  Just last week, GVF could have easily told me I needed two new tires after having been run off the road in a near-accident which resulted in truly needing an alignment and road-forced balancing of all four tires.  If I had been told ""your tires need to be replaced - they can't be balanced"" I would have believed it, considering how hard I hit when I was forced off the road; but instead of trying to sell me new tires right away, I was told that I could easily get another 10K miles on the tires (with normal driving wear & tear) before needing to purchase new ones at $300 a piece!

In another instance, it was discovered that 3 of my 4 shocks were leaking (probably as a result of the same incident mentioned above), the replacement of which was covered by my warranty.  When I inquired the price of replacing the 4th shock at my own expense, I was informed it wasn't necessary at this time and they would watch it when I come in for oil changes; if the 4th shock started leaking as well, the warranty would cover it - that a new 4th shock was not necessary.

Now, how many service departments can you think of that would pass up on a sale when the customer asks?  I can't think of any.  Saved me from buying a $200+ part and the labor associated with it!

Another big point to their favor - there is a nice-sized ""brand name"" car rental counter right in the service drive.  How much easier can it be?

334,"May 04, 2017","It took over 5 hours from the time we got there to leave with our car. This included a test drive and they were busy but that seems excessively long. Not once were we offered a bottle of water or anything and they did zero negotiating and I mean zero. Also, when I went to meet with financing and decided to get the cheapest extended warranty they didn't tell me it would also increase the term of my loan by 6 months. The only way I realized was by going through and reading my documents in detail while I was waiting on my car to be cleaned prior to leaving which took them about an hour after the purchase was done when they had supposedly been working on it for at least an hour. If we hadn't needed a car badly that day because my wife's previous car was totaled from hail and we didn't have extra time to shop in the near future I would've walked out a couple times. I almost regret being honest with the salesman and telling him our situation because I feel like they pruposely didn't negotiate at all because they knew we needed a car.

363,"December 16, 2016","I purchased a Certified Used F-150 from the dealership approximately 8 months ago. At that time I was very impressed with the service I received from sales staff as well as the finance department. I also purchased an extended warranty since it was a used car.

when it came time to have some warranty work done on the truck, I made sure to take it back to see if the service department was as good as the front of house operations. I used their online scheduling system which was easy and fast. I was set up with Alfredo Zacarias as my service manager. Upon arrivial I was greeted and I showed him the issues I was experiencing. Alfredo was very thorough in looking at the truck and noting my concerns.   

To make a long story short, one issue was covered by the Ford power train warranty and a different issue covered by my extended warranty. Alfredo worked with me to make sure all of my issues were addressed, even when I was less than courteous with him about my perceived warranty coverages. I was also kept well informed of the progress of the repairs and total expenses.

I can now say that the service department at Grapevine Ford has performed  at the same great level of service I received when purchasing the truck. 

Prior to scheduling the visit for repairs, the sunroof on the truck was stuck 1/2 way open. It was on a friday and I needed the truck to go out of town the next day. Since I was in Plano at that time, I contacted the local Ford dealer and explained my situation and asked if there was anyway they could atleast help me get the sun roof closed so I could continue to drive the truck. At that time I was told that they could not even look at the truck for another week and I was on my own.  I then contacted Grapevine Ford and explained my situation. The service advisor explained that they too were very busy, but if I could get the truck to them that morning, they would atleast get the sunroof closed by the end of the day so I could get back on the road. I ended up getting the roof closed myself, but their willingness to help me out when the dealership that was literally 4 minutes from me blew me off speaks volumes about thier dedication to customer service.

When I got there to take delivery I discovered on my own they didn't get the right car.  I asked and they said it was, I referred back to our paper work and showed them it was not.  The sales manager Jeremy found out he could not trade for the car I wanted and he switched vehicles on our final offer paper and my final contract and paper work.  At no point during this process did they tell us they swapped cars.

After all this they wanted me to promise I would give them perfect marks on my survey they sent me.  All they care about is their survey.  Other dealerships want honest feedback on how they are doing, not perfect marks to hide their flaws.

406,"August 03, 2016","Through AutoTrader, I found the exact car for which I had been looking. When I made my first contact to Grapevine Ford, I was connected with Debi H. She was not pushy or belligerent, but very helpful in answering all the questions I had about the car. When I made my offer, she was patient to work back and forth with me and the sales manager. When my offer was accepted, she did a video walk-around to show my every detail possible about the car. She did not hide anything from me. It was a bit of risk for me (money and time) to fly from KY to TX to do this deal. When I arrived at DFW airport, the dealership sent over a shuttle to pick me up (thanks Richard!). When I arrived at the dealership, Debi had breakfast (egg McMuffins) waiting for me. After a test drive and some paperwork, I met with James Brown (no, not THAT James Brown) to complete the financial details. He was top notch as well. Though he was very professional, he was very personable and friendly. The financial aspect (including tax and license from my state) could not have been smoother. I even had a better payment than what I was originally quoted! GET THIS: I was picked up at the airport at 8:15am and was driving away from the dealership, with my new purchase, at 10:30am. In just two hours and fifteen minutes, an out-of-state buyer had purchased and liscenced a car in a different state! If I could give more than 5 stars, I would. Thanks Grapevine Ford!",5.0

He was just full of excuses rather than trying to take care of the problem. He tried blaming Enterprise and that they are not part of the dealership, but the dealership is the one who gives out the rental vouchers.   Hey Tom, here is a clue for you.  You hand out the vouchers and the Enterprise rental people are located right inside your service department so it is your problem if they are not taking care of your customers. You might want to take it up with Enterprise next time rather than throwing a poor attitude at your customer.

When asked if he could get a new car salesman we were told to ask at the reception desk. We asked the receptionist for a new car sales person and she looked at us funny and said she would call one. We started looking at the cars on the sales room floor while waiting. 15 minutes passed without anyone coming to help us or talk to us. We were about to leave when the Salesman named Sauce asked if we were being helped and proceeded to help us. I told him the cars i was interested in he told us he had some options to show us an went to get the car. What he brought was a Used Lincoln land boat when I clearly stated I wanted a New SUV. After test driving this and expressing a lack of interest in the car he relented and showed me a different SUV then I had asked to see original. Why this was closer to what I wanted it was not the right fit. So he proceeded to push the Lincoln Land boat very hard. At this point we made the decision to leave the dealership as a high pressure sales push to a car is not how I prefer to buy a car. The entire way back to our car he kelp pushing the Lincoln and telling me what an amazing deal he could make me on it.

Also, he never even returnied my call, in which I explained that no oil change was necessary, and then all it needed was the cap put back on and a check of the oil level. Then, he ordered a $147.00 diagnostic on the engine (PCM), not the transmition (TCM). When I complained about the unnecessary oil change, and the wrong diagnostic, the $200 + bill was written off by the dealership. I was thankful for this and appreciated it, and was willing to give them another chance. I advised that I would pay for the proper diagnostic on the transmission.

There were no marks on the vehicle when I arrived at the dealership, but somehow, within 2 hours, it was ""significantly damaged""?

We received threatening text messages and calls wanting to resell/take our already paid for car because they lost the paperwork (that we still have for evidence). The finance department submitted an inaccurate and incomplete loan request even after we told them we were going to get outside financing, because they admitted they made mistakes that could not be fixed. This is causing us to get hundreds of rejection letters from all the financial institutions they have in their system. Their blunders have SEVERELY damaged our credit.
Darren Louis, ""Sales Manager"" was a big part of the problem since he dropped our finance request to begin with when he got his promotion around the same time. He didn't pass on our case to another person in finance and lost our paperwork. Angel Turner was a nightmare to work with. She was rude, condescending and made most of the threats as well as lies trying to cover Ford Grapevine's mistakes up. Tony Gonzalez, General Sales Manager, and Darren Louis threatened to take our already paid for car away and tried to intimidate us. Tony sold us a car that had a lot of mechanical issues, and he was afraid when I mentioned lemon laws. Tony also started trying to lie about the law to convince us not to lawyer up.

After two visits it became apparent that he did not have an Escape (or Explorer), new or used with these features. My second visit occurred because he called me to test drive the ""perfect"" car which turned out to be an over priced pre-owned black (I asked for white) Explorer previously owned by a smoker without the safety features I specifically requested. Before we left Nolan wanted us to meet his supervisor Carl White. At that moment it became apparent that Grapevine Ford did not have the Escape or Explorer with the equipment package that had the safety features (lane assist, adaptive cruise control, cross traffic alert, collision avoidance/braking assist) that sets Ford apart from its competitors.  Instead of telling me that they did not have the car I was looking to buy, Mr. White preceded to insult me by explaining that these features add to the cost of the car implying that I should consider a more affordable Ford without these features.  This is where I left to visit another Ford dealership where I ultimately bought a new Explorer Limited with the 302A equipment package that include these safety features.  Based on this \ disappointing experience, I would not recommend going to Grapevine Ford Lincoln for your car purchase. I felt not listened to and ultimately insulted.

This was on Thursday morning and I told him that I would be in Grapevine on Saturday visiting relatives and pick up the truck ( a 3 hour drive for me).

The finance dept did not call on Ths. so I called again on Fri morning, talked to Toby, and he told me he would go right over to financing and have them call me ""immediately"".

Now that it has 12,000 miles on it and is in the shop for warranty issues, I cannot get a loaner car which was ""promised"" by the salesman and finance people any time I needed work done which is a big reason I bought the warranty.

We meet with Dustin, he was very nice and pleasant and was not pushy, let us know what we needed to know about our potential decisions and pros and cons but didn't try and force anything upon us, let us know all our options from all angles. If you go here I would see him. We made a couple trips, on the 2nd we figured out what we wanted and did trade in's and got approved and were able to take truck home, they would have final paperwork ready next morning. This is when it all went down hill. Ryan Jeter cared about the money and nothing else. We were taken to the back in a office far away from the open area, something respectable dealerships do not force you to do.We were told about extras and such and bought a few, we were offered the ""Zagg tech"" car protestant for $599 which we were told was 5 years of car washes and they would apply protestant to the paint, the dash and leather every 6 months. I turned to my Fiance and told her that leather treatments cost $150-200 and it would be well worth. She agreed it was, we told Ryan we would take it. Six months go by, we ask for protestant, only the exterior is done. Called sales to verify that they do interior, was told yes. Bring car back in, interior still not done, speak to service manager, told it does not include interior.We were busy that day so next visit we go to sales and ask to speak to Mr.. Jeter's boss about it, he told us it was included and he would take care of it. Pick up truck, not treated, told by service that its not included and sales just tells people it is. At this point I don't know what's true or not. But its not getting done and service will not do it. So even though we gave ford $29,000 for the truck, Ryan Jeter felt the need to lie and get $599 more out of us. Back to the buying. I made 4 trips after we signed paperwork because Ryan Jeter had no idea what he was doing and left messages but never returned calls to verify messages and was brining into things I didn't need to and not brining in what was needed. Whenever we came on a return trip he never saw us in person, always had to deal with middle men. Last message he left was to call him back because he needed more paperwork, called back for a week without a return call and finally found someone willing to find out what he needed, which was nothing.

Understandable, but it would have been nice to be informed of this information BEFORE you accept and twice confirm a Saturday appointment.  Needless to say, we won't be choosing Grapevine Ford for any future service needs.  After a less than satisfactory purchase process at Grapevine ford 13 months ago, we have already written off their Sales Department as well.   ",2.3
504,"September 12, 2013","I have given the dealer a low rating for the following reasons:

I spent roughly 10 hours waiting in the dealership for sales staff to walk between offices over a period of 4 days.
I did not even get to see the car that I wanted to, supposedly it was out of stock even though it was marketed online.
The sales staff over promised and under delivered at every step.
After the purchase, I was lied to by a salesperson. 
Upon confrontation about the lie, I was told that they were willing to BUY the car back from me.
After the purchase, nobody is prompt at responding to queries via email or phone.
I filled out the dealer survey and received a call regarding the remarks I made, but they have not acted upon any of the promises they made.

506,"August 25, 2013","We had a terrible experience at this dealership. It started with a car we found online. We were looking at a Preowned Escape, We were contacted by a online salesman who told us he had the Escape and actually said he had 9 . We drove to see the 9 Escapes. When we got there before we could view the cars he made us answer some questions he filled out on a form. Then he dissappeared for 20 minutes. We thought he was checking on the Escape inventories . However when he came back he still had NO cluse what his Inventory was and if there were any escapes the year... the color??? Very unorganized and clearly not knowledgeable. We were very frustrated because he told us he had 9 to look at on the phone.He then Brings out the manager who did not know the inventory very well but he did mention the white Escape we came to see just sold. HUM..... ??? he said he had a few others. We get in a car and are driven by the saleman in and out of rows of cars searching for the Escapes..... He has no clue where they were .... we finally come across a LIME GREEN escape ??? and 1 black one. Highly dissappointed that we were told there were 9 to look at. Highly dissapointed that they have no knowledge of their inventory or the location on the lot where their cars are!!!! Very frustrated.. we go inside and another manager aprroaches us ... not sure why ? He didnt offer to help or explain the unprofessional and unorganized sales experience !!!!!

The problem was what I had thought, and told them from the beginning but they wouldn't listen or should I say chose to overlook. They actually told me that water LOSS was just expansion and retraction with heat and cold. If it was just expanding and retracting, why was the water spewing all over the engine (leaving water marks and substantially less water in the reserve) and why was I having to keep jugs of water with me to refill it? Guess they think the general public is stupid and didn't pay attention in elementary science. Anyone with a 6.0L truck or SUV beware, if you haven't had head gasket issues yet, you will and this place will pretend that it's not a wide spread issue that has already been in courts for years now. Another FYI, if they tell you that going to another dealership would cause the diagnostic and repair process to start over, it's a bold face lie and one they told us. All testing is entered into a Ford data base and is available to any dealer. Ever since this experience they have hounded us for business, are they crazy!

I called back and told him about my trade, and made an appointment.  Even though I showed up a little early, Brad came and greeted us right away, and got a floor sales person named Adam Bracken to assist us.  After appraisal, Adam showed us the car, and I must say, Adam was an expert on all the car's features.  He says he spends his down time reading and studying about the cars, and I believe him.  If you want someone knowledgeable, ask for Adam.  I have purchased cars before from salespersons who obviously knew about as much as I did about the car.  It was great to have Adam know the car so well.  It did take a little time, but, hey, we're not buying shoes here.  Financing was a little back and forth, but you should expect some negotiations.

518,"April 18, 2013","Bought a 2012 Ford F150 and received good service from the sales man, but after that things went straight downhill.  The finance manager is very stubborn and pushy.  Very high pressure sales to purchase extended warranty.  Then, had to have some hail damage repaired on the truck and was assured it would be done in a few days.  Never received a phone call for three weeks.  I finally called and had to push the situation to get it taken care of.  Then, they said it would be done in a few hours.  Three days later, it was done.  Then, went in 6 months later to get a seat control fixed with my ""bumper to bumper"" extended warranty.  Oh, that isn't covered.  The finance manager assured me everything was covered and that if anything is 70% or more worn at the end of the warranty, it would be replaced.  Wow!!! I was robbed.  The extended warranty cost almost $3000, which I did not realize until I had already signed the papers.  They put all the numbers in and tell you a per month price for the truck with the addition of the warranties.  The way these snakes work is they start you out at an outlandish interest rate and outlandish extended warranties, then they start working the interest rate and some of the warranties down.  It is a very tedious and long process.  Their goal is to wear you down and when they start at an $800 a month payment and come down to $500 a month, you feel like you are getting a good deal, but in actuality they are sticking it too you big time when you finally read thru all the fine print.  I buy a truck every two years and will never give them a dime of my money.  I am sure there are much better Ford dealerships out there.  This one is very shady and untrustworthy.

519,"March 25, 2013",I purchased a new truck from Grapevine Ford in December.  The purchase experience was pretty straight forward although more time consuming than I would have liked.  I had a scheduled appointment with a salesman at a specific time yet I still had to wait for 20 minutes or so before he was available.  A waste of my valuable time. The test drive process went well and the salesman was knowledgeable. At the end of the process it was explained to me that I would receive a Ford survey and I was VERY strongly encouraged to give the dealership all excellent marks on the survey. I complied with the request but wish I hadn't because I did not feel that Grapevine Ford did an excellent job. They did an OK job. I was sold a rear seat entertainment system with my truck but the head rest TVs were on back order and I was told that they would arrive in 6 weeks. I was told that I would be contacted to set up an installation appointment. Well it is now 3 months later and Grapevine Ford has not contacted me once. I have to keep calling them to find out what is going on. They have my $700 so I guess they really don't care if I ever get the TVs.  Extremely poor service after the sale.  ,3.4

Outstanding Experience!   Very attentive salesman and absolutely No Pressure.    I have bought at least 4 new cars over the past 18 years, and this was my best experience!   First of all, I researched the explorer and new all of the costs from A to X plans, Invoice etc.  I communicated via email to save time and the &amp;quot;Dance&amp;quot; with a few dealerships.  Grapevine Ford, in particular Reid, provided a window sticker and there ""Out the door price"" via email.   I shopped around and a few dealerships were a little cheaper via internet until you called them to confirm everything.  Then they added the ""Dealer Add-ons, etc""......then the price quickly shot up. 
Grapevine Ford provided their best price up front and made my decision easy!

   I visited the dealership on Friday night and looked at the vehicle.  The salesman and I verified the price, and there weren't any hidden ""Add-ons/Surprises"".  Due to timing and tired kids, we made an appointment for Saturday morning and we were in and out of the dealership in less than 3.5 hours.   Paperwork/Finance was a breeze, however most of the time was spent with the salesman explaining all of the options, Nav, sync etc.  He was very informative and entertained all of our questions.  Chris in Finance explained the extended warranty, however there wasn't any pressure at all.  This was a great experience with my wife and kids.  I highly recommend this ""No Haggle/Dancing"" dealership if you are in the market for a New/Used Ford.   Well worth the drive/savings from OKC to Dallas, TX.

527,"August 18, 2012","I was going in to look for my first car from a dealership. I've had other cars before, but not from a dealership. So I was worried about it, would I be ripped off, would I be pressured into buying one, would I get something I couldn't afford, the typical worries. The dealership I was at before I came here did all those things. Then I came here and Emmanuel came up and started talking to me about the cars that my mom and I were looking at in the used car lot. I looked around, found one that I really liked, a 2011 Chevy Aveo with just a little over 14,000 miles on it. Emmanuel told me he might be able to work it out to where I could afford the car, so we went inside just to hear him out to see what could be done. After sitting down and talking about it, we figured out that I would be able to afford it. This was a huge sigh of relief because I am a student and I needed a car that I can use for longer than a year, unlike my previous cars. We ended up lowering the price a little bit and trading in my car and working it out to where I was at a comfortable amount to pay each month. After that, I went in and talked to Brian (the finance guy) to get all of that and my warranty set up. He was also extremely nice and also made small talk to make my mom and me feel comfortable.
Emmanuel is an exceptional salesman: he talked about his family, he made small talk with both me and my mom, he laughed with us, all those things people should do to make their customers comfortable. He is still extremely nice to me when I come in too.
Brian is also very nice when I come in as well. He even offered to let me take his car to get food. I didn't, but it was a very nice gesture to offer that.
The only problem I had was that the recall wasn't taken care of on my car before they sold it to me, I feel like that should have been taken care of before anyone got the chance to buy it. But even still, Emmanuel and his manager made sure that it wasn't a safety issue for me to drive it and he made sure to get the part ordered so it can be taken care of.

531,"July 27, 2012","First off, I was very pleased with my sales associate, Robert Miller. He helped my pregnant wife and I find the right vehicle for our growing family. He was very knowledgeable and easy to work with. I am pleased with the vehicle that we decided upon, the 2013 Ford Explorer. My issue is with the games they play to try to make money at Grapevine Ford Lincoln. I was initially quoted a price of roughly $39600 on my vehicle even after telling them several times that my budget was to stay below $35000. After haggling for 2+ hours to get the price to something I could live with, I was told that it would be just a few minutes until I would be ushered back to the finance guy, Brian Mainard. We sat there waiting for over an hour before anyone came by and inquired as to what we were doing. Once we got back to Brian's office, he pitched us 15 kinds of insurance for the vehicle, all sending the total cost well past my budget price. After I told Brian I wanted NONE of the extras he was trying to sell me, he put his sleazy car salesman hat on and ""worked the numbers."" He said he would keep my payments the same and offer me the extra services. I thought ""great,"" I'm getting these services for free. Essentially he lowered my interest rate, but charged my for the price of the extra insurance, keeping my payments close to the same, but again sending the total price well past the price we had shaken hands on several hours earlier. My question is, if he has the power to reduce interest rate with the wave of his hand, which was half of what he first quoted me, then why wasn't I offered the lower interest rate in the first place? I'll tell you why, because they only care about the bottom line and nothing about helping the customer into the right vehicle for the right price. Here is the kicker! Once I got home I searched cars.com, for similar Explorers, which I had done several time while researching what vehicle I wanted. Lo and behold our Explorer was on there. I must have missed it when searching before. The kicker is that the list price on the vehicle on the internet was only $400 more than what we finally agreed upon, $4000 less than the $39600 I was originally quoted. That would have been a great starting point! I hope you have learned something from this review, I know I have.

Price being the usual issue, their team talked us through the computation process and cleared most of our doubts. We took a step back from the original top line but still had the amenities expected.

543,"April 02, 2012","Why did I rate Grapevine Ford so highly?  I just purchased a new F150 from Grapevine Ford.  I went there because other dealers said thay couldn't beat the price.  I'm glad I did.  The sales staff and everyone you encounter is friendly and eager to help you.  They saved me a good bit of money as well.  I couldn't be happier with the experience of buying my truck.  My old Ford had 260,000 miles on it and was still original.  I'm sure I can get that much out of this one if their service is half as good as their sales department. I give them an A+++ rating and highly recommend them to anyone lloking to purchase a new vehicle.

I knew the struts needed to be replaced but I wanted the service department to take a look to see if any other damage had been done.  They informed me that the tie rods needed replacing.  When I asked for a price for each I was told $388 for the struts and $185 for the tie rods.  When I arrived I was given an invoice for $971.  When I talked to the representative he denied ever quoting me a price for struts and pretty much walked away.  What a bunch of crooks.  He offered no help or explanation as to why he would quote me one price and charge me almost twice that amount.  I will NEVER go back to this place again.  ,1.6

608,"September 08, 2010","I tried at length to get a straight forward quote on a new vehicle and was given the old ""we only have one at the low advertised price...blah...blah.""

So I email several local dealerships and request a quote.  The one with the best price and honest answers wins my business......that was not Grapevine Ford.",2.4

610,"September 04, 2010",I gave them this rating due to the fact that we were made to feel like part of the family.  We purchased from Five Star Ford for many years.  We had purchased 13 cars from five star and had been treated very well but in July we went in and was made to feel like our business was not either good enough for  them or they just did not care to make the sale  We had also been looking to purchase an F150 from five star but they just did not seem to want to work with us.  We went to another dealership in Grand Praire and tried to make a deal they got real close and even called us back several times that day to try to get us to come back because they wanted to make the sale.  We told them we wanted to go back to five star due to they had been so good to us and we felt loyal to them.  When we went back they really had no interest in making the sale they said we can not make the numbers work they would not even get close to what we were asking.  So we left and did not purchase.  At that time we told Justin Compton at five star when you get the 2011 mustangs in we wanted him to call us so we could come and test drive one because we were interested in one.  We never got a call.  So for my birthday in July we went looking at Grapvine Ford and they had  them in and we drove it and we loved it so we sat down with them and began the process.  They worked to get the numbers right and even threw in extras so we decided it was time to move on since five star was not interested in our business.  THANKS GRAPVINE FORD!!  I LOVE HOT ROD SALLY!!!  ,5.0
611,"August 31, 2010","I purchased a new F150 and ordered leather seats to be installed by the dealership. I asked that the leather match the stone interior that was from the factory. When the leather was installed, I was disappointed that it did not match the rest of the interior trim. It was light grey and the rest of the trim was tan. I waited a few weeks to see if the mismatch was more my pickiness or if it really did not look right...When I took the truck back in, Skip Harmon, sales manager,immediately saw that the new leather was not a good match and he had it replaced. The dealership did in fact order the correct ""stone"" color leather, but we all realized that the after market ""stone"" does not match the Ford installed ""stone"". Grapevine Ford did the right thing quickly and without hesitation when they could have either delayed the action or decided not to do anything. They deserve to be rewarded with future business.

612,"August 29, 2010","Purchased a 2005 F150 for my son two days ago.  It took the service department 2 days to make ready the vehicle.  I went to the service department to inquire on the status and why it was taking so long and I was told that they had so many vehicles to process.  I specifically asked if there was anything wrong with the truck and received an resounding no.

Today it will not start.  The anti theft makes a clicking noise and the light blinks on and off.  

I feel duped by all.  I will notify Grapevine Ford on Monday.

I will update this site and all blogs related to Grapevine Ford and Ford products upon the course of action by the dealership.  Hopefully they will live up to the glowing reviews on this site.

I found the truck on their website and the price I was given was the lowest of any of the dealers in DFW. Reid Harmon is a man of his word and takes care of his customers like they are old friends. 
Thanks for the experience.

614,"August 21, 2010","Jesse Garcia was my sales person and Skip (sorry but I cannot recall his last name) was the sales manager handling my transaction. Both were very helpful and cordial and I believe I received the best deal I could on my new F150. Jesse even removed the hardwired radar detector from my trade for me. After driving I am sure what seemed to Jesse practically every truck on the lot, I finally settled on a Lariat. All in all, I am completely satisfied with the deal and look forward to driving my new truck for years to come. 
Also, Tom in finance was extremely courteous and quick to close the transaction. I appreciated everyones ""no pressure"" approach. Great job!",5.0
615,"August 19, 2010","Jesse and the staff at Grapevine Ford were very cordial and helpful.  This was the second vehicle I purchased from Grapevine Ford in the past 9 months, and the helpfulness of Jesse was exceptional.  The price of the vehicle was well below any offers from other dealerships in the area, and I didn't have to go through any pressure sales presentations in the finance office like I've heard about and been through in previous transactions.
Bottom line, Grapevine Ford works hard to *EARN* your business and they deserve it!

616,"August 17, 2010","I wanted to update my F150(2002) with a 2010 model. Ken gave me a test drive and I liked the performance. When I came back Rae helped me pick out the unit, color, and all the bells and whistles I wanted on the truck. They both were very knowledgable on the trucks. There was no pressure, just answered my questions. We then went to pricing and trade-in part of our meeting with Rene. He was very helpful and we got to an agreement on the figures.  My only negative experiance was over an hour wait to sign the papers. I realized it wasn't really their fault. They had so many sales that day and were working as fast as possible to clear each with the same care they gave me. Each of the personnel I worked with were caring and thoughtful. I have recieved at least 3 phone calls making sure I was doing ok with the new truck. This is the best experiance I have ever had with a Dealership. Keep up the good work!  Rayford H.",5.0

But, my sales person, Jonathan Bray, had great patience and was a joy to hang out with in the mean time!  Everyone I dealt with was great to work with.

 It was my pleasure doing business with Grapevine Ford.  From the time I walked into the dealership the receptionist was pleasant, courteous, and efficient through the negotiation process with Troy Pace who was personable, cared enough to inquire about the type of music I preferred and played during wait times which is soothing and effective, to the finance people who treated me with the utmost respect.  I never felt pressured or like my wishes were not being heard to move a vehicle that I did not care for.  They gave me exactly what I wanted in a reasonable timeframe.  My overall experience with Grapevine Ford was above satisfactory.  I will look forward to continued business with your dealership.

630,"July 14, 2010","Grapevine Ford in Grapevine, Texas met all of my expections as a dealership.  Sales people greeted my husband and I as we walked from our vehicle to the entrance door.

We were ask ""How can I help you?""  All sales people were busy. Taylor DeWitt was the first sales person to come and talk with us. He was friendly, courteous, and knowledgeable.  We knew that we where in good hands. We trusted him and his advice.

After learning the type of vehicle and price range that my husband and I were interested in, Taylor took us outside to select the color vehicle and take a test ride.

Back at the dealership, we checked out the Extended Cab vs the Crew Cab of the Ford 150 XLT.  The Crew Cab had a better backset floor area for carrying my golf bag and other boxes that we need to haul.

Taylor was able to get the pricing within range of what we thought was a good buy.

We continued through the buying process.  Drove home the happy owners of a brand new Ford 150 XLT Crew Cab, Candy Red pickup.

Thank you,

631,"July 01, 2010","Grapevine Ford in Grapevine Texas takes a different approach to selling cars than what I have encountered in the past. I have bought a lot of cars in the past 40 yrs and can honestly say that each of the previous experiences had a common thread. That thread being an attempt by the dealership to convince me to adjust my budget to the price and payment requirements generated by the dealership. Not so at Grapevine Ford. From the salesman, finance agent to the sales management staff a group effort to pull out every stop in the process to accommodate my budget, not the dealer pricing. My firm budget established was never questioned nor were my wife and I made to feel embarrassed or uncomfortable about holding within our budget. 

Thanks Grapevine Ford for listening to the buyer and meeting their needs and not pursuing your own.",5.0
632,"June 01, 2010","Was at that the dealership for an hour and a half before I even got the price on the vehicle I was looking at (rule of thumb, if you're in the business of selling you might want to know the prices). The price once i did get it was extremely high. After haggling for another 2 hours i got them down to what they called their ""absolute lowest"" price they could do and we parted ways from there. I had a friend call the next morning inquiring about the same vehicle and they gave her the price I had just spent 3 hours to get right off, over the phone. The manager informed me before I left that these deals dont come along very often. Turns out they do, I bought one a day later. It was newer, nicer, fewer miles, certified and less money. Thanks Grapevine Ford for not selling me a car... Your the best!",2.4
633,"May 16, 2010","THE MOST AWFUL experience we ever had buying a used car! Agreed to terms (actually was paying full price), was told the car was ours and the salesman, James, put the keys in my son's hands- saying it's a done deal. We were paying CASH for 97% of the vehicle but needed to finance the rest... We were 110% honest upfront. They kept telling us... It's a done deal. After 4 hours in their dealership, they changed the terms in the finance office...yes, we were pissed, yes we raised our voices a little to the finance guy. His response was...well i didn't tell you that. He was trying to make us finance 55% of the vehicle at a higher interest rate than agreed on for almost double the amount of years and he didn't see any big deal with that. Then when we told him we were told and agreed to these other terms, his response was... ""well that's not what I said.  I'm telling you this."" My husband asked, well isn't this all Grapevine Ford?"" Aaron acted like it was only him and we were starting all over in a new deal. We were told there was almost a year left of the warranty, come to find out that wasn't true - no factory warranty left.  So what good was it to talk to the salesman and his manager and waiting for 3.5 hours before we finally got to talk to the finance guy if it all changes when you get into his office.  No one had any accountability to what they said. What a joke, and was your typical used cars salesman crap!  I'm letting all my friends know of my personal experience because I dont believe businesses should be allowed to operate like this.  I was nice until waiting 4 hours and finally seeing the guy who we agreed to the original terms with. We told him nothing he said was true and he was even blown away saying no way... this is a no brainer. He told us to wait, and asked if he could get this deal, do we want the car... we said yes so we waited another 15 minutes before Anthony came out with him. Anthony asked, How can I help you. We told him that Kevin got him we didn't ask for him.  So he said ""Good! Go home then"" in the most smug, disrespectful cocky assed attitude. I was shocked and amazed! I turned around and said ""wow- your classy"" his response was ""your classy and we dont want your business - go home"". I asked for his business card then his name and Anthony refused to give it to me or tell me.  My daughter remember his name from a piece of paper (and it's also online with his photo :). He said, well he has this on camera - like some kind of threat. I said good, then you have all the lies on camera too! Prior to this, we spoke to this guy for 30 seconds at the most to tell him we weren't doing the deal. We didn't yell at him just simple said no deal.  I blew up and was livid when he said Good! Go home then! After being in his dealership for a total of 4 hours, was paying full price for a used car, was going to pay 97% cash,  being lied to in every detail... to be told ""good, go home then!"" Their future customers deserve to know what type of business they are running.  Trust me folks, we were very pleasant and easy to work with until ever part of the deal changed and no-one had any responsibly in the deal. The worst experience and would never recommend them to even my worst enemy. Wouldn't even go down there to receive a free car if they were giving them out.... just couldn't trust them. The world works in mysterious ways though... we found a vehicle, much nicer, less mileage, better condition for a thousand dollars cheaper the next day and they accepted our cash offer and was grateful to do business with us.
