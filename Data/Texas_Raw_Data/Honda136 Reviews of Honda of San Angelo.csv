1,"February 09, 2019",They kept my vehicle for two days. One day just to do A diagnostic test then when I finally called at the end of the day and told me how much it would cost to fix it I told them just to do the oil change in the transmission filter change and ask him could you be sure and get my car out by 12 o’clock Saturday because I was going on a trip and he said no problem but 12 o’clock came and went nobody called and I still haven’t got my vehicle,2.0
2,"December 02, 2018","My experience at Honda of San Angelo was to say the least horrible. I had received information that they had been purchased by another company. I had previously gone under old ownership, and my experience wasn't great, but it was significantly better. The cars are overpriced, the sales teams are great, but the way I heard management talking to their employees was absolutely disgusting. I wouldn't give my business to anyone who treats their employees that way, because it shows a lot of how they treat their customers. I immediately went to dodge before I even got inside after watching a manager yell at an employee in public. Disgusting ethics, if you need a car please go somewhere else. ",1.2
3,"September 15, 2018","My 2012 Honda Accord front end sounded like it was grinding on deceleration after driving about 800 miles.  Within a short time, it was discovered that it was 2 loose lugnuts on driver side!! Amazing catch, since my car was last serviced at a Tulsa, Oklahoma Honda dealer for balance/rotation. Thanks Brock and Raymond for the save, literally!",5.0
4,"August 25, 2018", I dealt with each department at the Honda dealership and each one of them has no problem lying and misleading to get their best sale.  After selling me a car that was not what they said it was their lied about prices of service including over doubling  the oil change prices to talk me into getting extra services. When I found out the car was not what I had asked for I brought it back and I was told we thought you do what you were doing. And that’s their stance.  The tent job was pointed out the date of sale and they told me it had bubbles because it was brand new Tint.  Now I have to take it back in on my time and have all windows re-tinted. Back glass will have to be replaced. ,1.2
5,"August 13, 2018","You all have two excellent service advisors and this is what had kept me returning to this store. The service advisors are eager to help, explain the work process, and they each always have a smile on their face. Please let them both know that I greatly appreciate the job they do and being treated like a true customer.  Thanks",5.0
6,"August 13, 2018","I brought my 2013 Honda Pilot in for a routine oil change, a new rear wiper blade and to have the battery checked.  Brock Guevara is my service coordinator.  When I called to make the appointment, he listened to my request and paid attention to what I was asking to have done.  He actually remembered our conversation! I have had other service coordinators at other dealers NOT listen and perform work that was not asked for so having Brock actually listen and remember was GOLD to me!",4.8

8,"August 09, 2018","I did not like what was said outside the office to the other salesmen before the sales pitch. 
It was in poor taste boasting because, I could hear the salesman boasting about the deal he is about to make. As if I got taken advantage of and somehow paid too much or got too little for trade. 
Overall, it left me with a bad experience. ",3.4

14,"July 25, 2018","My wife and I went in to look at a new 2018 CRV Touring model. Our sales rep, Enrique Medellin, showed us the vehicle and came with us to our house to see if it would fit in our garage. On the way and back, he described the many features and how to use them. During the purchase, Enrique helped us get a good price for the CRV and for our trade-in (2009 Honda Fit). He also helped us secure a better interest rate on our loan than what was initially offered. After the purchase, Enrique took us out to the CRV to help us set up our phones and to demonstrate how to use and maximize the many options included with our model. Overall, this was a great experience. Enrique was personable, helpful, and well-informed. We will return to Honda of San Angelo for future purchases and will tell our friends to to the same.",5.0

18,"July 17, 2018","To whom it may concern: 


Unfortunately, I'm writing this email to inform you of some wrong doings I feel need to be corrected. 

On June 20th, 2018 I purchased a 2018 Honda Civic LX from Honda in San Angelo,Tx. On Thursday, July 12th, 2018 we dropped the vehicle off with Honda Services to have the window tint redone due to large amounts of air and fluid filled bubbles. Later that afternoon, my husband called to check the status of the vehicle; he was told ""the employee who does the window tint did not show up for work, it would be another day or two."" 

After this my husband asked for them to put me in a loaner vehicle due to the fact they had our only means of transportation. Which they did. Friday, July 21st, 2018; the second day they had the vehicle Raymond called to inform me that the car had been done but he wasn't happy with the results so he was having his employees redo the tint for a third time! 

Finally Saturday, July 22nd, 2018 the car was ready. Upon arriving at Honda we proceed to remove our belongings from the loaner vehicle to put back in my car. As I open the back door I see black smudges and stains all over the back seats and front passenger seat. The interior of this car is very light grey! I walked into the service center and asked about the stains in the car. I was told by Raymond the service manager "" Ma'am I didn't inspect the car, it was hot outside. So I got in, drove it around, parked it and came back inside the building!"" Raymond also asked me to bring my car back again on Monday, July 16th, 2018 to leave for 2 to 3 hours so they could try to remove the stains on the seats and do a full wash and detail. 

I'm furious at this point! I just signed paperwork on this vehicle and they have ruined my interior! Upon arriving at my house, my husband inspected the tint and it was worse than it was before I originally took it the first time! I was informed by a friend to reach out to Buddy Jones at Chevrolet in San Angelo. I talked to Buddy, filed a complaint and made an appointment for Monday, July 16th, 2018.  Buddy stated he would look at the damage and take care of it.  So at this point I'm semi okay. We go to get groceries and as I open the trunk I find that it  is full of water. Green soapy water. There are white glue stains on the back of the rear seats, there was water seeping into the cab of the car into the the seat backs and cushions. I called and left another complaint for Buddy, as he had left for the day. 

So come Monday we take the car to the Chevy house. Just to learn that the only way the water could have gotten  into the trunk was to seep through the back dash and through the seats. So after another 2 days of someone else having my car we go to look at the work that has been done to the only  Brand New Vehicle I have ever owned!! 

Tim the service manager for Chevy comes out and talks to us as we are going over the car. There are still stains in the seats. There are still bubbles in the tint! There is water damage to the rear seats and unknown amounts of water damage done to the back dash not mention the stereo components that also reside in the back dash. Tim says to me "" I reached out to Buddy and let him know that there is nothing else we can do for the seats except seat covers or new seats! I DID NOT pay $ 23,000 plus for seat covers or for someone to wreck the interior of my personal property that I had just purchased! 

 I feel so incredibly screwed over. I do feel like all the guys who we have interacted with at Chevy have been more than helpful and have done everything they can do. Now I'm reaching out to you! I need a remedy for this situation. Not a cosmetic fix.

 I want the damage fixed and my windows tinted the right way! I was informed that since the interior can not be cleaned anymore because the damage is done that I could request to have a leather kit installed in the car to fix the damage caused by an ever so careless employee at Honda. I would also like to ask that since this is the fourth time that the windows will have to be redone if we can take it to an outside shop and have it done at Honda's expense. I feel like I'm asking a lot but at the same time I have had my car for exactly 3 weeks and  1 day when I took it in for tint services.  It has been in 2 separate shops for a total of 6 days counting tomorrow! I need this made right! How would you feel if you were in my shoes?  Just spent that much money on a vehicle to  have all this done to you. This has been the worst experience I've ever had buying a vehicle. This  should NOT be my first experience of buying a Brand New vehicle period!

The carelessness of the tint installer at Honda amazes me.  I hope this can be fixed and perhaps the installer needs more training on how to treat customers vehicles.

89,"September 11, 2014",I recently bought a Honda Civic from this dealership and I was lied to repeatedly. I was asked to sign a blank contract.i overpaid $3000 on the car and that is only the beginning of how much money I lost through this dealership. They said that they would make my first car payment which they forgot to do. I had to call them to remind them when I was late on my payment because they did not honor their word. After having my car for three months I brought it back to this dealership for the oil change. The service department left my drain plug loose and it fell out later when I was driving down the road. I had to tow my car back to the dealership. They said that it was ok but if I was worried that I could have a new car for the same price and we would trade even. Well let's just say their idea of trading even was tacking on $400 a month for 15 months longer than what I owed on the car. I have been without a car for a month and lost all my down payment and trade in because of their service departments mistake! I did not want a new car. I had just bought a new car. They said my car had depreciated $8000 in just 3 months. No one at the dealership including the GM Paul Hatcher will return my calls. Then after not resolving these issues they send some one late at night and drop off this new car at my home! The car that has literally cost me and my husband thousands of dollars! Never ever go to this Honda dealership! ,1.0

On one vehicle the plug was stripped causing oil to leak.  I work in the Permian Basin or Dealership there fixed the problem for me.

Last Monday, 7/28/14, I took the second vehicle for an oil change.  My daughter driving it back to Austin, TX
got stranded on Hwy 71 (in between Brady, TX and Llano, TX).  The plug got lose or fell off causing the vehicle to lose ALL of the OIL.   I had to pay for towing service.  Car was smoking.  No lights turned on the dash board to indicating a problem and neither did the engine shut off as a safety procedure.
What is worst, I'm still waiting on the General Mgr - Paul Hatcher to contact me.  Every time I call-he is out/meeting.

98,"November 21, 2013","WOW is the word to describe my experience this month at Honda of San Angelo, TX. I have two stories to share... first my sister in Christ, more than a BFF to me, Anita P. had some health issues come her way that caused her to no longer have the strength to climb in and out of her 2010 Ford Explorer that she bought a year ago and still owed $15,000 on her note. She needed to exchange it for a car she could ride in that would help her to get around town.  Well she went to Honda of San Angelo and Andrew work a miracle for her... with their used car program they found a dealer who bid $15,000 for the Explorer that freed her up to pick out and purchase a new Honda Fit. I should say a new Honda 'perfect' Fit like a glove.  Now when she needs to be driven to her appointments she can get in and out without any problems and got a new car after a year of buying a used car and did not double her debt. I had my concerns that she would be getting herself into a bigger loan payment with so much carryover from her earlier car purchase from Coleman.  So a month later it came time for my car shopping experience with Honda of San Angelo, TX... WOW I was met by Robert Lopez, he may be new to Honda, but he has all the right stuff! Friendly, a great listener, and made it so easy for me to explain my current situation what kind of car I was needing and what I needed my car payments to be. He knew that it was do-able and he knew he had the perfect car for my needs. It was the smoothest, easiest car purchase my husband and I have ever had. Everyone came together to get me the best deal, the best finance interest rate they  could do to get my payments to within $20.00 of my monthly desired request.  Tomorrow we sign the Loan papers for the last time and I have a 'new to me' 2010 Nissan Sentra that fits my budget and my needs nicely. If you need a car go see Andrew or Robert. I so recommend this car dealership to anyone who want to be treated fairly and with respect.  The finance team there are all awesome and are miracle workers! ~ Sharon Moran a very satisfied customer!

99,"May 24, 2013","I would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere thanks and gratitude regarding our recent experience with Honda # 117 in San Angelo, Texas. We were traveling from Houston to Albuquerque, NM when we began to notice a slight miss in the engine of our 2001 Honda Passport. After checking the internet for the nearest Honda Dealer we immediately proceeded to drive the 80 miles to reach this dealer. Upon arrival , we were warmly and politely greeted by Scott (Service Advisor). We described the problems the problem we were experiencing to him and then seated ourselves in the customer waiting area. Within a short period of time we were informed that our problems were somewhat more complex than what we initially believed them to be, and would require a bit of time to diagnose . We were CRUSHED !! Here we were ......stranded in an unfamiliar city knowing absolutely no one there !!!!!  It was at this point that Nick Nicholson intervened and assured us that they would promptly determine and repair the problem with our vehicle, Not only did he assure us that we were in good hands , he went above and beyond our expectations in providing us with the ULTIMATE in customer assistance. He brought us into his office and assisted us in locating lodging , took the time to explain the sights and attractions of San Angelo and the surrounding area, shuttled us to a local car rental facility, and showed a TRUE and GENUINE concern regarding our situation. In addition, Nick provided daily updates regarding our vehicle . It took a few days to determine the problem ( IMPROPERLY PERFORMED SERVICE AND PARTS DONE PREVIOUSLY BY NON-HONDA REPAIR FACILITIES ) but upon final repair and test drive our Passport was running better than ever. I would highly recommend this dealership and in particular Nick Nicholson for taking the time to show what REAL customer service means !!!!!!  Sincerely, Bray & Silvia Garza ",5.0

102,"July 16, 2012",We went to this dealership for repairs on our CRV and decided to purchase an Odyssey. David Prince was our salesman and we completed the deal. First mistake was paying cash because it took from labor day until mid November to get our tags. The dealership Lied about everything pertaining to the tags saying the state was the problem in supposedly giving us handicapped tags when in fact we never got the handicap tags. They finally sent regular plates after we contacted American Honda in California about the problem. They also lied about the reimbursement of money we paid to have the handicap equipment installed. Took until December to get that money back. Paul hatcher DID NOTHING to solve the problem and could care less about the customer. This was the worst buying experience of 40years of purchasing vehicles. David Prince would not even call us back about anything.,3.0

110,"May 02, 2012","I have never dealt with a group of people quite this dishonest.
 This goes beyond the typical “used car salesmanship” techniques.
 These people sold me a CRV that had to be delivered from another dealer.  
The salesperson Eli, the only honest individual in the shop – found the vehicle and “locked it down” meaning it was to be delivered the following day..  
The sales manager SERGIO CARDENAS  worked all the numbers and we executed a contract, they took my cash down payment and my trade gave me loaner and told me the car would be there the next day.  
They then decided they didn’t like the numbers, which were very generous and I would have been very open to considering a renegotiation as I believe that they may have made a bit of losing deal for themselves.  Instead of being professionals in the beginning and just telling me they couldn't put the deal together that I wanted, they took the process out over 5 days, two other cars I had driven and could have purchased at other dealers were sold.  According to other Honda dealers this is a technique to take people off the market even when there is a good chance they wont have a sale. 
However, they chose to  “tell her we can’t find the car.”  SERGIO CARDENAS, the sales manager  called me and could hardly stay on the phone it was so obvious he was not telling the truth. I told him no that we had an executable contract and they needed to find the vehicle and told them they could expand on the colors and the time it took.  I asked who his supervisor was and he said I am which was odd - so I began contacting Honda and Lithia. 
Lithia and Honda have no real control over these guys.  Hatcher is GM over a number of dealerships and can really do whatever he wants with no repercussions from the corporate owner or manufacture. 
 Within about an hour,  on the internet I personally found 6 of the vehicles in question in their trade-able area and have documented conversations with three dealers who confirmed Eli confirmed the availability of the vehicles and a willingness to trade (one was under negotiation but would know in one day if the car was not available.)    
By complaining to Lithia I got a call back from SERGIO CARDENAS’ boss PAUL HATCHER. 
 I kept telling PAUL HATCHER and SERGIO CARDENAS that I didn’t care if they lied to me at the start but to tell me the real reason why they wanted to unwind the agreement.  
Every dealer was telling me they were lying to me – the car we agreed to was out there, I told them to take all the extra time they needed to get it here.  HATCHER is a bully. He is a dishonest human being who literally bullied me into giving the loaner back.  
I know that they put together a deal that lost them some money.  Had they been honest, I would have negotiated that deal to something reasonable. I also know that they have taken far bigger loses on other deals however, Sergio’s repeated references to the fact that I am a single women tells me I am an easy mark to bully and lie to and these gentlemen think there will be no consequence.  
 Sergio and Hatcher tried to blame the entire thing on their finance guy (who made some mistakes but was clearly acting on Sergio’;s directions) and Eli who did everything he said he would do including finding more than one car that could still be delivered today..  BE very very careful of these people.

He has a great sense of ""customer service"" and took pride in working with you. He worked for his customer and not himself; which, too many salesmen do nowadays. When it came down to my bottom-line he took it to his manager and made a deal. He didnt beat around the bush and come back with numbers that I didnt ask for.

Eli from Honda of San Angelo called me last week wanting to purchase my car as they had a potential buyer for it. Since I had family over last week and personally don't like dealing with dealers, I told him that I can not sell my car for a week. Eli then called me back after a week wanting to purchase my car. He then transferred me over to the GM of Honda (Sergio). Being a little skeptical, Sergio assurred me that they are a legit dealership and they do this all the time. Being on my computer, I went to their website, read their reviews on google and agreed to sell my vehicle to their negotiated price. Sergio took down all my info, told me that they will cut me a check and will pick up my vehicle in couple of days. He enforced that please don't sell my vehicle to anyone else and to take it off the market. The next day I called Eli to follow up and he said they are working on a driver to pick up my car and will be done in the next 24 hours. During this process, I got calls from couple of potential buyers for my car but I told them that my car is sold. Today, almost a week has gone by, I have left several messages to Eli and Sergio with no response from either of them.
