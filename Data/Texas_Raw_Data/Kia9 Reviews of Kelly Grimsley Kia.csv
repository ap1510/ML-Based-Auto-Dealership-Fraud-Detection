From top to bottom Kelly Grimsley Kia is by far the best place to buy a car in San Angelo, TX. Let me tell you why. 

1) NO PRESSURE - there is a laid back sales process that doesn't steer you to something you don't want. You decide!
2) Service - The salesman I was using was off from work and came in to help me and my family. He didn't shift me on to someone else. He did the work!
3) Professionalism - everyone here treats you with such respect and they take pride in their products. 
4) Warranty - 100,000 miles for 10 years? Can't beat it. 
5) Extra mile - they address the whole family. Everyone is important to them and they make it known. Their management treats you the way customers should be treated. 
6) Free coffee/drinks - free coffee is always a good thing while you wait. Our salesman even gave us ice cold water after coming in from the heat. ",4.8

8,"July 29, 2017","Took my just purchased Sorento to Kelly Grimsley Kia (bought it from them the day prior) due to finding a few issues not identified when I was test driving the vehicle.  Drove it of the lot and notice some stuff after the fact.  Called my salesman, Yuli (sorry I am sure the spelling is wrong) who told me to bring it by the next morning.  So I brought it back and the service department and used car department discussed and said I was good and the used car department would take care of paying for the issues discovered.  Admittedly, I understand buyer beware, especially on a used car, so the fact that they were more than willing to hook me up speaks volume of their commitment to a good experience.  Thank you Kelly Grimsley Kia for a great experience and fixing all my problems promptly and professionally.

Cheers.
