0,"December 23, 2017",Trey was very straight forward and gave us the information we needed and Bailey was very efficient at closing the deal. My only complaint would be the interior rear window was not cleaned!,4.7
1,"December 15, 2017","I had picked the 2018 Elantra GT sport with the tech package as the car I wanted. They were really hard to find because they were pretty new but Trey Moss was persistent and found me one without charging a transportation fee.   I was apprehensive about having a dealership have to bring something in that they normally didn't have in stock as I didn't want any added crazy fees because they knew for sure that I wanted it. With that, they did get one in and their price was very competitive regardless of having to bring it in.   I definitely didn't feel like this dealership was about ""What can we get out of you"" first and they were quick and straight-forward from start to finish.",5.0
2,"December 14, 2017",I hate buying a car because I always have to argue about what I DON'T want. Not here. I told Trey exactly what I wanted and he didn't try to show me anything that was outside of those parameters. He was professional and kind. The service people were great when I brought it in on Monday for the sealant. He even gave me discounts I hadn't read about.,5.0

4,"November 23, 2017",I found James Wood Hyundai to be very knowledgeable and low pressure. I dealt with two salesman that I would highly recommend. Trey Moss worked with me on picking the best car for me and James Ray Garrett helped me with my trade-in.,4.8
5,"November 04, 2017","Went to dealer to test drive the new Ioniq. Trey was very informative answered all of my questions including things i couldnt find out about the new car online. (I like to do allot of research before I buy a car) I left that day to think about it, and did not feel rushed or forced to buy a car like i have been at other dealers. Came back early that next week and negotiated a price to buy the car. Very satisfied with puchase and will be a return customer",5.0
6,"October 07, 2017","I needed a vehicle to replace my 2011 Sonata that was totaled (not my fault). It was a very good car that I took care of and it looked new and had 135K miles. I was looking at another Sonata and since James Woods serviced my car and they did great work I knew where to shop for a replacement. Due to the hurricanes and floods the price for a low mileage used car was more than expected. Joe recommended I look at new also and I'm glad he did. Great car, 2018 Sonata.",5.0
7,"September 21, 2017",Trey was very helpful and knew what we wanted. He was curtious and helped us with the 2018 Sonata we wanted. Thank you Trey! Love the car!,5.0

15,"August 09, 2017","What a wonderful experience it was to buy a vehicle today. Start to finish the entire process was absolutely seamless. Trey Moss fulfilled every single need we had. He was friendly, efficient, and promoted a stress-free environment. We are from out of town and had some difficulty with our local dealership. We made ONE call to James Wood and were blessed beyond measure to reach Trey on the other end. He was forthright and stuck to his word and his honesty and integrity speaks volumes. I'm not sure we will ever buy a vehicle anywhere else. Love my 2017 Hyundai Sonata!!!! Thank you James Wood and Trey Moss!!!! Superior customer service!!!!!",5.0

(One not their fault one was) Another dealer delivered the wrong vehicle which caused a delay. The dealership accidentally had me fill out the wrong forms and I had to drive back to refill them out.

32,"May 05, 2017","Upon calling the dealership I was connected to Ms. Bailey Ward.  I had called a few other dealerships and asked for a female salesperson but there were none on staff.  While this may not be a factor for others, it is for me (I am female), so Ms. Ward is the reason I even drove to the dealership.  I had arranged to test drive an Elantra which she had waiting for me but upon entering the showroom I saw a Sonata Sport Turbo that grabbed my attention.  She mentioned the Sonata had some good incentives ($6,000 Hyundai, $2000 dealership) plus $750.00 if financed thru Hyundai.  I test drove the Sonata and bought it.  It was a very pleasant experience and more dealerships should hire sales ""ladies"" such as Ms. Ward.",5.0
