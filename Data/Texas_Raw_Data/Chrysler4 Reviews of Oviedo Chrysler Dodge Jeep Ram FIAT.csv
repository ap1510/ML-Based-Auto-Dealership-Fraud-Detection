0,"October 23, 2018","This dealership came highly recommended by a freind. The dealership is beautiful and the majority of the staff are exceptionally wonderful. We live 3 hours from the dealership, drove there Saturday to look at a truck which when we got there wasn’t even as advertised . It was advertised as a manual trans when it was a auto. No big deal mistakes happen. But we also can’t drive the truck because it had just been taken in on trade and they were working on it. Ok, we were still interested. The numbers they came up with on our trade was in the ballpark of what we were looking for. Our only request was to keep our aftermarket bumpers off of our vehicle and not be docked for it like they proposed and for them to make sure we had 2 key fobs. We didn’t haggle the asking price or trade in value. My husband was told by our salesman that “ his manager wasn’t going to loose a deal over $1,500 that we could keep our bumpers, not be docked the $1,500 and that they would get us a 2nd fob” we said we would even take off our own bumpers to save them the shop time and money. So my husband spends his valueable time dropping our bumpers and he yet again drove 3 hours to test drive the other truck and to “ finish the deal” at that point the manager Peter Leighton wants to rudely argue that none of that was agreed upon before hand! He basically insinuated our salesman lied and continued to argue the deal. Now, I’m not in sales but I’m smart enough to not throw my salesman or myself under the bus by either lying or saying someone lied. Mind you we are trading in a 2014 LARAMIE LONGHORN for a 2012 ST/ SLT , same mileage.. and you want to argue over $1,500!! Let’s look at this black and white, WE WERE LIED TO... to get us back into the dealership. They finally agreed to $1,000 on the bumpers , my husband was basically bullied into giving up $500 which was already promised to him. Yes it is only $500 but it is the principle, we don’t do business with cocky rude liars! I was stuck at work and unable to attend this closing otherwise I promise you we would have left in the same truck we pulled in with and went to a more accommodating HONEST dealership. I am LIVID!! I WILL NOT be recommending Oviedo to a single person. ",2.6

2,"December 01, 2014","Oviedo Dodge is not your normal dealership.  Their goal is to make a lifetime customer, not just the sale.  Johnny Oviedo went over and beyond what I was expecting from my experience.  You can find a true family environment.  I would recommend to anyone.",5.0
