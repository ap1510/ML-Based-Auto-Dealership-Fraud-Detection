0,"June 21, 2020","I called Hill Country Honda because I saw a used car on their website that I was interested purchase for my granddaughter. They scheduled an appt in the morning to look at car and said they have it ready for me to test drive. We wasted one hour and we had appt and this sales person could not find keys!!!!

1. The sales person showed us the car and then went to get the keys; and brought the wrong keys.
2. After taking approx 20 minutes waiting for him; he said he could not find them. So we went to look at other cars. Found one we wanted to test drive.
3. Waited another 20 minutes and he could not find the keys.

Recommend them...A BIG NO

1,"October 26, 2019","We he tried to put me a Pilot but I asked for a CRV and Passport. Numbers didn’t fit with Pilot then he move into the CRV, talking about numbers we spoke of $460 but ”we are so close”, talked about an EX trim but I liked the EXL and told him I will come back when I was in a better situation. He tells me about giving a $500 down payment they would match with another $500. I told him if I gave $1000 would they match. He said let me ask, then yes we can do it. Turns out that numbers are for prior vehicle for Pilot for monies, but will still honor deal. Awesome right! I tell him before I get any approval can I go show my wife, I get the okay, it takes a while until I even get to get close to the CRV. He tells me o am going to go put gas, goes around back then comes back with another CRV but the EX. I had told my wife the deal was for the EXL, the salesman didn’t announce the new vehicle just trying to sell. I told him that’s not the vehicle I want, I told him taking the vehicle I wanted to the back and coming back with another is not right. I told him the deal wasn’t gonna happen because he was being deceiving and I left. I paid attention to these many things because I was reading the prior review.",1.0

They are not truthful, honest or listen to customer related to needs or circumstances. Do yourself a favor, trust your instinct and go. Then spread the word go to Gunn instead.",1.0
