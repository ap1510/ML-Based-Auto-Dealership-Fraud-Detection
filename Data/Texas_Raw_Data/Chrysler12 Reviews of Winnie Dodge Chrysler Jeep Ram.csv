Got me the truck I wanted with all my aftermarket request with no hassling. It was an awesome experience buying a vehicle from him. Financing department was wonderful to work with. All in all I was in and out of the dealership in an hour. I will be back for future purchases",5.0

4,"October 12, 2016",I had a great experience at Winnie Dodge. I am from Winnie Texas and I believe in keeping business local. They treat you like family and make purchasing a new vehicle very easy. I recommend Winnie Dodge to everyone who is in the market to purchase a new or used vehicle. Jason Sonnier was my salesman and he is the one to see. ,5.0

6,"October 12, 2016","I have purchased every vehicle in the last few years from here. I found a vehicle online that fit the bill. Drove almost 2 hours and reached Winnie Dodge. I was shown the truck I wanted to buy and after a few minutes of pricing they were much less expensive than any other dealership. The pricing was so good I left with 2 cars, a 2015 Cherokee and a 2015 Ram Ecodiesel. So far I have sent them 4 people whom have all said they were taken care of extremely well and could not believe how good the pricing was. I also do all of my service with them which is as good as the sales team. Totally worth the long drive even though I live 4 miles from another Dodge dealership. Keep it up Winnie Dodge, you have a customer for life!",5.0
7,"October 12, 2016","When I was purchasing my Durango, the salesman was so knowledgeable and spent time with me to go over everything I wanted in my new car. I always felt like I was receiving the best care when going through this process. I have since had my Durango serviced multiple times with their service dept. and every time received great service. They have explained everything so that I could understand what needed to be done. I would highly recommend this dealership to anyone looking to buy or service a vehicle. ",5.0
8,"October 12, 2016","I bought a Chrysler Pacifica from the guys at Winnie Dodge. It took a lot of work to try to find the right car for my family and I, and is something I couldn't have done with out the help of the guys at Winnie Dodge. They have the best customer service out of any dealership I have been too. It was such an enjoyable car buying experience. I couldn't have done it with out them. All I can say to the guys at Winnie Dodge is thank you so much for what you guys did for my family. We love our Chrysler Pacifica.",5.0

10,"October 07, 2016","Helpful enough to make you think they care.  Brand new car burning oil, and there's no solution to it. 
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND MID COUNTY JEEP or ANY OTHER ONE, NOT THIS ONE!

11,"July 21, 2016","Worst customer service ever! I have never written a negative write up prior to this experience, but I am compelled to do so now. My brand new Ram Truck (2400 total miles) overheated on my summer vacation while passing through Winnie, TX. I had it towed to the Winnie Chrysler dealership on Saturday night July 2nd. They were closed, of course, due to that hour of the weekend. No dealership is open on Sunday, and Monday was the 4th of July, so I knew it wouldn't be looked at until Tuesday, July 5th.  I called the service department manager, Chris, Tuesday morning to see if he had any questions regarding the write-up I left with the vehicle.  He stated ""no.""  I asked when he was going to look at my vehicle, and he said that he had a lot of appointment service calls to look at first. So I called back Wednesday, July 6th, same response.  I called Thursday July 7th and he said that it was to be looked at that afternoon.  I had my wife call them Friday July 8th and Chris said that they would look at it soon.  Up to this point, the dealership had not called me once.  Saturday July 9th, my wife called to see if it had been looked at: the service department said it was to be looked at next.  No calls from Winnie Chrysler came that day.  Sunday they were closed. Monday and Tuesday July 11th and 12th we expected a call: none came. Wednesday July 13th we called and Chris stated that the trucks replacement serpentine belt broke and they had to do further investigating. No call from them came on Thursday. Friday, July 15th,  we called and the service department said they ordered a part for my truck and it would take 4 days to get that part in. I waited Sat, Sun, Mon, Tue, and received no call. Wednesday, July 20th, I received a call from Chris stating that my vehicle was ready.  19 days to fix a belt and pulley.   When I drove the 100 miles to pick up my vehicle, I asked the cashier at the dealership how many service bays there were there. She told me that there were 14. I looked into the service garage and two of the 14 service bays had vehicles in them.  14 service bays and it took them 10 days just to look at my vehicle, and a total of 19 days to service my vehicle.  In the entire 19 days, I received one (1) phone call from Winnie Chrysler, and that was to inform me that my vehicle was ready. So I drove the 100 miles to pick it up and returned home. What do you expect my recommendation would be after that experience? Appalling customer service! Zero professionalism. But hey, it was under warranty so the cost was zero$$ to me. ",2.4
