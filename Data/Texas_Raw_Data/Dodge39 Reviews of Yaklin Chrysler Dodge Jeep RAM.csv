0,"April 23, 2019","Bought 2019 Jeep Cherokee limited, came in without navigation system,salesman admitted he made a mistake and would get the program and install it when it became available, now they say it cannot be installed and will not do anything about it. Horrible place!",1.0
1,"March 25, 2019","Took my car in prior to appt. time, left my car. Did not hear from them all day. Called at 4:47pm to be told they had not yet even looked at my car. It was there NINE HOURS. Said they would have it looked at by noon the next day, sometimes it ""takes 2 or 3 days to get it evaluated"" (I gave them a list of the problems). Was then told cars were taken in order of appt. My car was 3rd or 4th on their posted schedule. No explanation given. This place had great service with previous owners, no service now. They used up my whole day off as I have no other transportation. Will never go here again and will surely share my experience with anyone who asks.",1.0
2,"September 14, 2018","I am four hours away from this dealership, but they had a car I really wanted and nobody else had. I never had to work so hard to get somebody to sell me a car.  No response to emails, text messages, or phone calls. If somebody happened to answer the phone, they would talk to me, but they would never return calls.  We agreed on one price over the phone, it was a different, higher price when I got there. I was told one interest rate over the phone, the on-site rate was three times higher (my credit score is over 800). I decided to just pay cash for the car, they wouldn't take it; said they needed to finance the car to give the lower agreed upon price. Took over 4 hours to buy this car!!  Then I got home with it and realized it did not have an inspection/registration sticker. They knew full well I was coming and the car had not been cleaned or detailed.
While I was cooling my heels in the office for 4 hours, a chirpy little girl responded to the text I had sent several days earlier. I told her I was sitting right outside her office trying to purchase the car but she kept right on with her script like she hadn't heard me. 
I have bought a lot of cars and this was the worst experience I've ever had.",2.0
3,"August 17, 2018",Never will I go here! They made me believe I had purchased my new vehicle. I left with it the same day and signed all the paperwork the following day but when I asked for a copy of the paperwork they refuse to give it to me! I took the down payment there yesterday like we agreed and they refused to take it because it was under my husbands name. Then they told me that the banks statements I had given them were suddenly not good enough to prove my income anymore! I had called a family member who’s in the car sale business also and he told me it shouldn’t matter where the down payment came from as long as I took the down payment and that if I signed a contract and they made me believe that I bought a car and let me drive away with it they cant change their story about if I am approved or not weeks later! They didnt even apologize! They made me call my husband to come and get me because they were keeping my car! So I don’t recommend Yaklin they screwed me over big time!,1.0
4,"August 13, 2018","Warranty work and oil change.  Kept us informed and answered any questions along the way, taking time to explain why or why not something needed to be done.",4.8
5,"December 03, 2015",I get my vehicle serviced regularly at Wyatt Arp and I am always very happy with the way I am treated. My repairs are always done correctly and the cost never seems excessive. I have been a customer for 19 years now. ,5.0
6,"August 27, 2015",Their dealership didn't do a good job the last time with my husbands truck but living in McQueeney we didn't have time to go to San Marcos prior to a road trip.  We asked for an oil change and the truck to be checked. 60 miles into the road trip the wheel bearings went out and we nearly lost a wheel and potentially our lives.  Stuck in Dallas with nearly a grand in expenses - we called them and they said we might could have caught it. Take the time and go to San Marcos folks for your safety and that of your family. ,1.4
7,"July 31, 2015","As a first time car buyer I couldn't have asked for more. This dealership provided me with great costumer service while I went through the process of purchasing my first car. The process went smoothly with the help of Nate and Dustin. Most of our communication happened through  the phone because I was unable to go into the dealership; I trusted them to guide me towards the vehicle that was perfect for me. All in all, when I went in to sign my closing paperwork I was truly grateful for their help in choosing the right car. It's unbelievable the amount of effort they put into helping me save money too. Nate and Dustin are a part of a great dealership, thank you so much gentlemen!

8,"June 22, 2015",I hate buying a new vehicle but the experience at Wyatt Arp Dodge makes it a lot easier. Barrett and Pete are great salesman. Dustin was also easy to work with and didn't feel like I was getting a pressure pitch.,5.0
9,"May 25, 2015","We purchased 2 vehicles between a time span of 6 months. The salesman that sold us both cars was Barrett Talley aka ""Bear"".  He was always very help and honest.",5.0
10,"May 22, 2015",Everyone at the dealership was extremely helpful in getting me financed for my new Dodge Journey. Barrett Talley went above and beyond to find me the perfect vehicle to fit my single-mom-of-3 needs and was able to get my payments within my budget. I couldn't have asked for a better salesman. Job WELL done!!!,5.0
11,"May 22, 2015","Barret Talley was an awesome sales person, he helped us get a great deal. My husband had a wreck and we couldnt get a car and barret helped us get it sooner than the insurance got it all figured out. I dont think i have ever met the most honest sales person, he also helped my aunt,uncle, and mom get super great deals and very fancy cars. If you need a deal and honesty his the guy for you! Check barret Talley at Wyatt arp! ",5.0
12,"May 21, 2015","Wyatt Arp was the best car buying experience we have had since moving her from Phoenix.  We wanted a RAM diesel but there was no way to get it financed in our monthly payment range since we were upside down on our trade.  Instead of telling us we were out of luck, Nate and Bear offered another solution.  They found us a new truck that would fit our budget and to top it off Dustin got us AMAZING financing.  At no time were we made to feel mad, sad, or inferior.  These guys treat you like friends/family.  They are all polite and will go out of their way to help you find what you need.  This has become our dealership in Texas and we will buy all of our cars from them going forward!  Thank you guys for treating us right!!! We look forward to doing business with you in the future!",5.0
13,"April 04, 2015"," Found a truck that was priced very well online. went to go look at it called back the next day to make an offer. I was told by the salesman  I spoke with  they would not honor the Internet price and for me just to go on down the line and forget about it. That is a first for me! Needless to say, I would not recommend this dealership or a few of the sales people there. ",1.0
14,"February 13, 2015","Found Challenger online inbound to the dealer, called delaer,  asked if it was already sold, answer was no. Asked if I need to put a depsoit on it right now, answer was no. Got my finacing secured, told the other two dealers I was working with, I am buying from these guys.  Cleaned up the traded to be evualated only to get a call 6 hours later, opps my bad that was a sold unit, it was a customer order. grrr I could have been on my way to pick up the other car!!!   ",1.0
15,"January 10, 2015",We were looking for one good truck our trucks had over 300.000 miles on them they took both our old vehicles as a trade in..The pricing was so affordable we were able to get two nice looking used trucks! Awesome!  We bought a Chevrolet and a dodge,5.0
16,"October 04, 2013","I am from out of town and while visiting my credit union had a fuel line break which caused diesel to spew all over my engine compartment and puddle on the ground.  Big problem.  I found the number to Wyatt Arp and called, Debbie answered.  She said they had a replacement in stock and gave me directions on how to get there, and stated she would go outside and direct me to the service entrance.  My truck died as soon as I turned onto the lot and coasted to the front doors.  Debbie, as promised, was waiting outside and called me by name when I walked up.  We went inside and she told me about breakage issues with that particular fuel line.  My truck was repaired by Stan who took the trouble to show me the break on the old line, and the design difference on the new line before he installed it.  Debbie and Stan were kind enough to prioritize my repairs so I could continue my trip.  Their taking the time to explain the problem and answer my questions left a great impression with me, and reflects very well on the organization.  My plans are to eventually retire and move here.  Wyatt Arp will be my auto dealer.",5.0
17,"July 20, 2013",My husband and I drove in from Round Rock after negotiating online with Bear.  Everyone was friendly and I loved the low pressure sales approach.  The vehicle we purchased was exactly as advertised.  We will definitely be recommending them to our family/friends!,5.0
18,"January 09, 2013","Barrett found the exact car I wanted at the monthly payment that fit my budget. Very painless transaction, hassle-free, with friendly staff. If anyone is looking for a great deal on a Chrysler, Dodge, or Jeep, go see Barrett at Wyatt Arp.",5.0
19,"July 16, 2012","I was looking for a new Jeep Patriot and first visited a large Jeep dealership in New Braunfels. The salesman there was there, and that's all he was. I quickly left when I picked up on his lack of interest. As I should have done the first time, I went back home to Seguin, stopped my Wyatt Arp to check out a Patriot there. Almost immediately, a very nice, polite, friendly young man, Barrett Talley, came out to help me. He listened as I explained my situation about wanting to get out of an ""upside down"" position I was currently in with the vehicle I was driving. Without any fanfare or pushiness, he very professionally told me he could get this worked out for me. I truly believed him, and he did! I have just the new Jeep Patriot I was looking at there and paying no more than I already was on a 2006 Explorer. Wow! What a joy this particular car buying experience was, and it's all because of Barrett Talley sticking to his word to do what he needed to do to help me get my new car. I can't sing his praises enough as he took care of business in a friendly, yet professional manner. 
The sales manager, Dustin Arp, was also very nice and helpful. This was my first, but not last, car dealing with this dealership. I deeply appreciate honesty, friendliness and integrity, and those qualities are found at Wyatt Arp in Seguin, TX.
Thank you again, Barrett, for making this all possible for me. I am one happy and blessed senior citizen!",5.0

21,"February 11, 2012","My wife and I just bought our second Jeep from this dealer. We went back to them because of our satisfaction with our first purchase there.In more than 50 years of car buying, this is far and away the most outstanding dealership I have encountered. In each purchase we informed them exactly what we wanted, and in both cases they searched until finding it. There was never any effort to convince us to settle for something easier to find. The atmosphere is friendly, and Nate Costa is more like a friend than a car saleman. Dustin Arp has all the right ideas of how to run a business, and if he has a bad apple on his staff, I have yet to see one.  Wyatt Arp is what all car dealerships should be, but few are.",4.8
22,"November 23, 2011"," I bought a new 2012 Dodge 2500 Hemi. I was told it would be ready @ 2:00 P.M.and when I returned I had to wait for over 1 hour. When I put fuel in the tank, the nozzle cuts off every few seconds (since the first time I put fuel in it), so it takes a long time to fill it up. I went back to the dealer and was told it would be a week before they would look at it. I work out of town, so I don't have a week to wait. I was told there  was nothing they could do. I noticed a different attitude once they got my money.",1.4
23,"November 05, 2011","Made a bad mistake and purchased from what was MISSION dodge, so did a member of my family.  Purchased an 02 Jeep that should have went to a junk yard.  Was promised an extended warranty that didn't cover anything that went wrong with the vehicle,once they closed their doors for not paying off trade in's and other dirty business deals I was left hanging for a decent service dept to rely on.
Found Wyatt in the book checked them out online and have been impressed every time. I drive 30 miles to get my car serviced there and will not let anyone else in San Antonio or TX touch it.
After experiencing their customer service and positive approach to all things, My family plans on purchasing from them in the next couple of months, as do I when I return from my deployment.  Thanks much Wyatt I have been very impressed and recommend you to anyone in the market for a MOPAR!!",5.0
24,"August 12, 2011","I had purchased a vehicle at Wyatt in 2008 with Mr. Wilbur, great service, great deal. We went back to trade in and purchase a new Dodge pickup 2 days ago. Pete Contreras helped us with it and we had a wonderful experience. The people in the office were great and very friendly. I will continue to do business with Wyatt as long as I am able. Please thank the team for me. The way they work together and conduct business together they are a wonderful team.  

Thanks Again!

I love my new Dodge!",5.0
25,"July 22, 2011","This was our second buying experience at this dealership Although some names and faces have changed over time, it was (and is) our first choice. Would we buy again? You bet!",5.0
26,"June 29, 2011","Used to use the local ""best price"" dealer who spent more time trying to bump you than making your experience easy. The team at Wyatt Arp made it easy and quick without all the games...don,t mind people like this making some profit, they deserve it!",5.0
27,"April 03, 2011","The reason I have given the Wyatt Arp Sales Team such a great review??... I't s simple, Nate and Pete were extremely helpful in getting me into a car that was perfect for my family's needs without pressuring me into a sale like other dealerships like to do.
At Wyatt Arp they dont treat you like a paycheck they treat you like family. My family has had a Toyota for 20+ years and after meeting the sales team at Wyatt Arp we honestly will be buying from them exclusively, seeing as the sales team at Toyota San Marcos was extremly rude and pushy not to mention not willing to work with us on price... KNOWING that we HAD to buy a car THAT day. Buying a car from anyone other dealership would be a waste of time and soo super frustrating, trust me... I have been there done that.
  If YOU are in the market for a new car whether it be a sporty fast car or the perfect family car, they will be there to assist you every step of the way.

28,"January 20, 2011","We were interested in buying a Jeep for our daughter. We shopped around a bit on-line and visited a few dealerships.  A friend told us about Sand Gibbs and Wyatt Arp.  We couldn't be more pleased with the results.  Sand was absolutely amazing.  He went out of his way to see that we were happy with our vehicle.  It was a complicated sale (traded in two vehicles) and yet, Sand made it a very easy transaction.  He even offered to meet us 1/2 way to sign papers etc. as the dealership was not exactly convenient for us.  Another driver from the dealership helped transport the trade-ins.  It was just a very pleasant experience. We will be looking for yet another new vehicle this coming Fall and are certainly going to return to Wyatt Arp and work with Sand again.",5.0
29,"July 30, 2010","I really have nothing but good to say about this dealership, I went looking for a used truck and found one I liked at a good price. The staff were all very friendly and not high pressure at all which is what I like. I will be purchasing a new car in near future and plan on going back to this dealer.",5.0

31,"July 15, 2010","I always get great service at Wyatt Arp.  
Have bought 2 vehicles from them and will buy the next there as well.  Ray and Debbie are great to deal with on the service end.  Sand always gets me the price I want on my new vehicles.  I have and will continue to refer my friends to this dealership.  ",5.0
32,"July 14, 2010","Always friendly, always accomodating, always fast.  They go over and above to work with my busy work schedule.  They also work with my extended warranty provider to ensure that they cover my repair costs as much as possible.  I recommend Wyatt Arp to everyone that I know...",5.0
33,"June 24, 2010","Debbie, Service Advisor, is always on top of what service needs to be performed on my RAM 2500 4x4 Cummings 5.9.  I call inadvance, Debbie gives me a window of time and my vehicle is always out ahead of schedule.  George normally services the vehicle and have never had to return.  ",5.0
34,"June 17, 2010",Always great service.  I drive 45 miles to Wyatt Arp Dodge for service on my 2005 Dodge Dakota.  I have dealt with Ray and Debbie in service and Kris in Parts and have always been treated with respect.  I highly recommend this dealership for consistent good service.,5.0
35,"June 12, 2010","Wyatt Arp Dodge is a great place to do business! I purchased a truck there for the first time in the year 2000. I was really happy with that truck because I got it for a good price and most of all their good treatment toward me as a first customer. They are just as friendly the times I've dropped by in the last 10 years. Now in June 2010,  I just traded in that first truck to  purchase my second truck from them. The service is still just as  great and they always  make you feel right at home! Sand Gibbs worked with me for about a month to find just the vehicle I was looking for. He is such a good expert on Dodge trucks and other Dodge vehicles.  Apparently he really does lots of research to keep up with all of the information that is out there.  Any questions I have had about my new vehicle they have answered over the phone. I got great prices for both trucks I have bought from them. I compared prices while shopping  around  here in the Rio Grande Valley where I live and they didn't compare with the deals Wyatt Arp had to offer. They give a personal touch  that's incomparable with any other dealership I have ever dealt with.",5.0
36,"June 06, 2010","Consistently the best service, the best customer care and the best price.  It is worth going out of my way to go to this dealer. They go out of their way to be excellent, and they look for ways to save me money.  Unlike other Dodge dealers, they do not nickel and dime you to death.  ",5.0
37,"June 02, 2010","Friday night before a planned 300 mile trip pulling a load with my '99 RAM2500 the check engine light decided to come on. After verifying the cause of the warning, Debbie of Wyatt Arp's Service Department made a World Class effort to fit me in to their already full Saturday schedule ensuring I would still be able to make the trip and meet my commitments. Larry was the Technician doing the work and explained fully the nature of the problem and how long it would take him to get me back on the road. After completing the work he double checked everything to ensure there were no other problems before sending me happily on my way.
The Service Team at Wyatt Arp has consistantly demonstrated this World Class customer service as shown by their 5/5 rating.
Thanks Debbie & Larry for doing what it takes to keep your customers happy and moving.",5.0
38,"May 25, 2010","The service department people at Wyatt Arp are very knowledgeable and friendly. I have a 2008 3500 Ram 4x4 dually and they have performed all of the service on the vehicle since I have owned it. I've had oil changes, a complete brake job, the 67000mi emissions maintenance, Turbo cleaned again, the ECU recall upgrade and replaced the turbo. All of the maintenance (except for replacing the turbo) was performed while I was waiting at the dealership. Ray & Debbie are very proficient at scheduling repairs which is why I only had to leave my truck once and that was due to waiting for the new turbo. It appears that the service writers and mechanics work well together and the quality of workmanship is exceptional. It is great experience dealing with them.",5.0
