0,"November 18, 2019","I bought 2018 Rogue at this dealership in November 2018. Bought extended warranty. I have a problem with the radio , Bluetooth, gps. It keeps cut off whenever its wanted. So September 2019, I brought it in for them to look at when Dare still there. He was very nice and had the tech ordered the software. When he was , no one knew what to do. He got back, they got it straight out and installed the new software, so it works like normal for a few days. Then I noticed, it cut off again, so I brought the car back to the dealership. Dare retired. No one else knows what I said or refused to understand. They wanted me to record it , I did and sent to them. I still want me to leave the car them running until I see the cut off. I asked for rental car because it Saturday and I have to get back to work. They wanted me to pay money to drive the rental car. I asked them does the warranty comes with it? They said they don‚Äôt know, I have to pay first. That‚Äôs wrong. Is anyone buy extended warranty here? It‚Äôs a rip off. I never heard extended warranty apply right after you bought the car even though you can‚Äôt blame on it until the basic warranty over. Just about the money. Still have to wait to the refund.",1.8

7,"August 14, 2019","When I got home I carefully read the details of the transaction and discovered an 1800.00 fee for ‚Äúdebt cancellation ‚Äú paid to the seller. Amazing, truly amazing... My choice to switch vehicles was a plus for both myself and the seller. I was already under, a little compassion would have gone a long way. I paid in cash 700.00 for a hitch that was not part of the deal. That should have either been returned or credited. I found a serious unethical weakness in the way business is done. Also, in preparing my technical set up...it was not completed because the employee, ‚Äúhad another buyer to assist. (All sad to me) I can say that the employees were courteous and hospitable but definitely not working in the best interest of the buyer.",3.4

My salesman, Lance, was very attentive to my needs, concerning the particular vehicle and my financing requirements. He was able to get me in exactly what I needed and the finance department ensured I came in well below my budget. I was impressed and vowed to return for my next vehicle, which I did.

  Much to my pleasure, my second experience was just as rewarding. The staff recongized me and Lance returned to my service. He, again, provided exceptional customer attention. I again was placed in a vehicle that satisfied my needs and came in below budget.

  From initial contact to leaving in the vehicle I wanted, the staff from Customer Reception, sales, service and financing made the experience a tremendous pleasure.

  Thanks Nissan of Silsbee!!

351,"October 31, 2018","I arrived at 7:35a, and didn't leave until after 4p. They provide free water, popcorn, but snack machine was almost empty, and when they brought out snack to refill it, some were 20 days out of date, and were expiring in 1 day. I still paid for 2 of those items cause having been there all day, I live 75 miles away and had no way to buy anything to eat.",3.8

357,"May 27, 2017","In my 78 years I have bought more than a few automobiles from more than a few dealerships from Beaumont to Alaska.  Though I can't recall any major problems or disappointments I may have incurred with any of my car buying experiences, I also don't recall any that I felt more comfortable  with than my experience with Nissan of Silsbee. It all started four years ago with the exuberant personality of Evelyn Brown who I would rate as perhaps the best saleslady this side of Fairbanks, and continues with Taffy Gore, the most personable and helpful Service Advisor I have ever encountered. I wouldn't think of buying from anyone but Evelyn and I sincerely hope Taffy remains in her role for as long as she cares to. She obviously cares about the folks who come in for service and, in my experience, has played a very important role in maintaining confidence and respect for the company's service department. In my case she has gone above and beyond to accommodate and to cause me to feel very comfortable with my probable decision to make my next purchase at Nissan of Silsbee. ",4.6
358,"April 30, 2017",Buying a  vehicle with Nissan of Silsbee is the easiest thing in the world. Dean and his staff are  professional and willing to work with you in anyway they can to make the exciting experience of buying a new vehicle awesome. My family has been dealing with Dean Bernal sense he opened his doors. Always happy with everyone there. Even in the rain they have brought the vehicle to me so I didn't have to get wet. After the sale they have always serviced my car in a way that I feel confident it's been done right. Evelyn Brown sold me my last  Murano and see is awesome to work with. Wouldn't go anywhere else!,5.0
359,"April 28, 2017","Thank you Nissan of Silsbee for a wonderful car buying experience!  We bought a used vehicle so it was nice to feel as important as the guy buying the loaded out brand new vehicle.  We were able to find our perfect vehicle without having to compromise on our wants. Our salesman Dean Bernal Jr. made us feel like family by the time we wrapped up our purchase  With four kids, you can rest assure we'll be back! ",5.0
360,"February 25, 2017",Purchaced 2 vehicles in 2012 which turned out to be unpleasant experience. Decided to give them another chance after 4 years. Figured they got the bugs worked out. But they still deceive  people to make the deal or to get Nissan off there back if you give them bad marks on survey. Promice you things but don't deliver. On a positive note there service department has made vast improvement and they added class with Jackie Gee,3.2
361,"April 29, 2016",When my husband decided to get another pickup he went to Nissan of Silsbee. They diligently worked with him and put him in a new truck. The next day they were able to put me in a brand new vehicle as well. My husband was in a wreck a month later. Once again they worked with him and the other guys insurance to put him in another brand new truck. We thank the owner and his staff for all of their time and energy spent to make sure we were happy customers. Their service can't be beat.,5.0
362,"April 13, 2016","So my wife Cindy Moore and I find ourselves in need of a pickup truck to pull an inherited 29' fifth wheel RV. Saturday afternoon Cindy tells me, ""Let's go make a deal with Nissan for one of those 2016 Nissan Titan XD's with the Cumins turbo diesel (we had looked on a previous Sunday and kind of liked them). So we do a little homework on our trade and the trucks value and head off to the dealer that had the most trucks on their lot, Nissan of Silsbee. We enter into the showroom, captivated by the yellow shiny Titan on the floor. That's when we met Joe Hinson. Joe is a local guy who worked tirelessly to carry my wife and I through one of the most enjoyable car buying experiences I've had.
Although the shiny yellow truck was fine we made our way out to the inventory and settled on a deep red 2016 Nissan Titan XD Platinum Reserve 2WD with dang near every bell and whistle a techie addict like myself could ever want...oh, and will tow 12,500 lbs! This truck is beautiful! Out comes Joe (he was assisting another happy customer when we met) and quickly delivers the keys for a test drive. Did I mention beautiful truck? We take the Titan XD for a spin and during the drive I notice the 'air bag warning light' flashing. Come back to that shortly. Well, we decide this is the truck for us so in we go fully expecting the ""salesman/manager criss cross"". Never saw it. Joe comes out, matches exactly the NADA trade value for a 2013 VW Passat TDi (plus a little), shows us the value of the Titan XD and asks how we would like to care for it (there were three finance choices provided - all perfectly acceptable). Cindy and I discussed which was a better fit and off Joe went. A short time later Joe introduced us to Karl (resident Nissan techie) who would assist us in Nissan Connect...connections. We're invited into the Finance Manager ""Butch's""? (I have a good memory...just short) office and are shown this amazing desktop computer that makes the ""deal process"" actually kind of fun. I mean this thing is high-tech! We wrap up all that and Joe, Karl, and Butch come out and familiarize my wife and I with our new Titan...thoroughly walking us through every detail. Cards and numbers are provided and we are told that story...you know, ""If you need anything just call."" Uh-huh! Right! Funny thing was that I've received emails from Dean Bernard Sr., Joe Hinson, Nissan America...all checking to see if the process and our truck are meeting expectations.
Remember the ""air bag"" light? It was suggested that we make an appointment Monday to have the issue resolved. Cindy needed to leave the truck so they fixed her up with a rental. The next day I receive a call from Joe Hinson to inform me that after discussing the issue with Dean Bernal Sr. and his brother (met him, very nice man and Sales Manager but the name escapes me...we'll call him Mr. Bernal) they offered their OWN PERSONAL 2016 NISSAN TITAN XD PLATINUM RESERVE for my wife to use until her truck was finished. That's going way above and beyond for the customer! We thankfully declined yet what a nice gesture. Anyhoo, the issue was a loose connection in a wiring harness and my wife Cindy, now referred to as 'Hot Truck Driving Mama', is driving her truck. That's how it all happened...Joe is our hero and the entire team at Silsbee Nissan is amazing. Thanks much for the experience, assistance, kindness, and support from the Bernal's and the entire team. We truly look forward to our continued partnership with Nissan of Silsbee!",5.0
