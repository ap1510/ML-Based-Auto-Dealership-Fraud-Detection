0,"February 22, 2020","We took our new explorer in for service and were never contacted with an update. I had to call them. They can’t fix their own cars. Loud rattling noise coming from the back seat while driving is “normal” to them. I have had other cars and never experienced that.

1,"October 07, 2018","Long story short, they didn't communicate to me what was going on while they had my car. The only time I learned anything was to call myself or stop by. My car was there for a week and still not sure what all was completed as I just told them I couldn't wait any longer... I need to be able to commute. And they only allow you a rental for 1 or 2 days covered though they will string you along holding your car hostage for countless days. I still haven't gotten the completed ticket with tech notes. I am going up there tomorrow to talk to a manager. This is ridiculous!! I got my car a week ago with promises of a completed ticket for my records. And they clearly DID NOT address one of my concerns stating the technician didn't have time to drive the car. WHAT!! A whole week and the tech hasn't driven it to diagnose a problem that can only be seen by driving it. Sad. Tired of typical but there is more. ",2.4
2,"May 10, 2018","Horrible experience.   My son currently serving in the Army was home for a few days and wanted to buy a new F150 while here.   He contacted Legacy several weeks ago and told them when he would arrive and exactly the truck he desired so they could have it ready.  The week before arrival he was assured it would be ready on Monday afternoon (the day he arrived).   When he called Monday he was told a delay so Tuesday at 1.   Tuesday afternoon he was told Wednesday at 1, then not until 2:30.   When he got to Legacy at 2:30 - still not there.   

When it finally arrived at about 3, he did a test drive and set the final buying process in motion.   It turns out they had only one sales manager (why have sales people if they can not make a decision?) and so things ground to a near halt.   He had called Ford about financing rates a was told 60 mos and 2.9% (note his credit rating is over 800 and he documentation showing he has savings to buy 2 or 3 F150's cash).    The sales man told him they only offer 5% rates.   

We pulled up the same truck on the legacy website and they showed several discounts and sure enough 2.9% for 60 mos with legacy name within the payment calculator box.   The sales man said that was some other thing that did not apply.   This is clearly a text book definition of BAIT AND SWITCH.   Because my son only has limited days of leave and his purchase date was already pushed back he felt pressure to just go along and continue the purchase.   Finally after 8:30 he drove away.    6 hours after arriving.

That truck buying experience was pathetic and legacy ford should be embarrassed.   I never intend to step foot into a legacy dealership again and hope this review will encourage others to find a dealer that does not cheat and respects a customers time.",1.8

5,"April 13, 2016","We bought a new 2016 Ford Explorer from Ryan Ford in Sealy (they came highly recommended - also another issue with a local dealership led us there, we live in Sugar Land).  After 2 weeks the electronics started having issues - the door lock on the handle wouldn't work sometimes, the mirrors would fold in but not out sometimes, the seat memory would get reset often and the back hatch wouldn't close automatically sometimes (had to manually close it) .  It finally got to the point where it wouldn't start because the battery was low.  When I went to jump it I found the positive cable was very loose.  I tightened the cable then drove it for 20-30 minutes and after stopping it wouldn't start again.  We took it to Legacy Ford and they tested it and said everything checked out and the battery just needed charging.  I didn't buy it and talked to the Service Manager who assured me that was all it was.  Well, about 2 weeks later the same thing happened again... this time after shopping we came out and couldn't get the doors unlocked with the key fob or door handle... we finally got the rear hatch open and crawled thru the car to unlock it.  We drove it straight back to Legacy.  The Explorer is used mainly on the weekend as my wife and I both work at the same place and ride together... I mentioned to the service rep that we didn't drive often during the week and after a week at Legacy the Service rep told me that if you don't drive it for 5 days the battery will lose charge and the issues we had could be from that.  I was incredulous!  When I challenged him he just said that is what our tech said.  After a short discussion with the Service Manager (again) we came and picked up the car and drove it to Ryan Ford.  They found the problem the first day... I tightened the positive cable on top of the battery... it turns out they have 2 positive cables - the other below the battery - and it was loose also.  Hats off to Ryan Ford in Sealy!  And a definite thumbs down to Legacy Ford service department.  Legacy service just kept telling me there is nothing they can do as long as there are no error codes showing up... Ryan Ford did old fashion trouble shooting to find the problem!",1.8
6,"November 28, 2015","I had an extremely disappointing experience with Legacy Ford. Legacy’s service/maintenance staff displayed a very unprofessional behavior and did not take responsibility for their mistakes. According to Legacy’s website, “all of our customers here at Legacy Ford are customers for life” I can assure you this statement is not true in my case. Four months ago, I took my vehicle (2012 Focus) for a clutch recall and a service representative stated there was a three month wait for the replacement part. Now, my vehicle started acting up even more and I went back to Legacy’s maintenance department. The same service representative stated that there was a mixed up with my original paperwork and I’ll have to wait an additional six months to a year for them to get the replacement part and fix my car.  Legacy’s website states “being car-owners ourselves, it's only fitting that we'd provide our drivers with the kind of courtesy, service and respect that we would expect”. I’m certain that negligence in managing customer’s paperwork is the complete opposite of the courtesy, service and respect that is expected from a professional. It is impossible to trust and continue to do business with Legacy Ford after such display of irresponsibility. If Legacy's service staff is not able to properly manage paperwork and order replacement parts correctly, then how can I trust the quality of their services? Legacy should be ashamed of these low quality standards. ",1.0
7,"May 29, 2015","First of all, I bought cars everywhere in Houston for over 20years from BMW, Toyota, to Fords. This dealership is the most professional and easy to work with. You get 5 star treatment and first class service. 

In 2012, I bought a titanium Escape load out with auto start, navigation, seat warmers, rear view camera, sync, and everything. I got a great price and bought easy care warranty to 100,000 miles. Loved it since I lost a key they replaced it, need oil changes it was covered, and the service at Quick lane with
Keenan is just impeccable.  I had a minor CV issue and brought it to Joe Meyers and got taken to the cleaners. Joe Meyers said I needed a break job here Keenan at Legacy are honest people and told me I really did not need it. They are so nice to work with that I do not have to worry about being tricked like other dealerships.

So when my sister needed a car I took her here too. 
Still same great finance person Tony Storrie help me get the same great plans that I had on mine. You just feel that Tony cares about the customer and really listen to our concerns. Since my first car he has been there and I will tell you it is impressive to have such a professional that goes above and beyond. 
So if you come look for him.

Now today I am back again for a Mustang GT v8 
For my hubby. So I contacted David Villeda and he was really helpful. Even when it was late night I was able text him with mustangs I wanted to show my husband. He called me in the morning to confirm the appointment and had the car ready for me.
So when my husband arrived he greeted him with keys and the two cars . That is what I called excellent service. 

Overall, I am again a three repeat customer because they are small town honest values  with 5 star service. I would recommend them 100%!",5.0
8,"March 05, 2015","My experience with Legacy Ford was unsatisfactory.  After coordinating with the internet sales department and explaining my needs, they set up an appointment with a different sales representative.  Upon arriving for the scheduled appointment, the sales representative was out conducting a dealer trade.  I had to walk through everything again with a different sales representative again.  I was assured that I would be offered the best trade-in value for my vehicle, which is why I drove to Rosenberg. However, the offer was $4,000 less than my other offers.  I asked that they match the other offers and I was told you could not do it because the other offer was a retail price.  I checked the NADA and it was nowhere near retail.  So, ultimately Legacy Ford was trying to make more than $6,000 on my trade-in, which I feel is deceptive and unfair to the consumer. I have shared my experience with the Legacy Ford Management team, and (not surprisingly) I have not heard back from anyone.  I will conduct my business with a different Ford dealer.",1.0

10,"January 22, 2012","I came to Legacy Ford to purchase a new Ford Truck. Wade was my sales person and he was great to work with. He answered all my questions and offered me a great price that I just could not refuse. Wade just made the whole process very smooth and easy. The financing was great too! As soon as I was done, my new truck was ready for me outside all nice and clean with some gas included!! If you are going to purchase a Ford or maybe a used car, I recommend you come here. Just ask for Wade!! ",5.0
11,"June 05, 2011","I went in to purchase a new car. I wanted a fuel efficient vehicle that I could afford.  Mr. Watts was very patient with me and took the time to show me a variety of vehicles and assisted me with making my final decision.  Mr. Brad Johnson and Mr. James Marion (the sales manager and finance guy) were also so very professional and kind.  I did not feel the pressure to make my decision on the spot.  They supplied me with the product knowledge I wanted so that I made the best decision.  I JUST LOVE MY NEW FUSION!!!!!  I will strongly recommend Legacy Ford and their great staff to all of my co-workers, friends, and family.  What a great place to do business :)",5.0
12,"May 26, 2011","My buying experience was great! I got a fair deal and that isn't easy at car dealerships.  I highly recommend Legacy Ford to anyone wanting to purchase a vehicle.
I was in and out of the dealership very quickly.  They were able to sell me the truck that I wanted and got my payment within my budget.  I am very pleased!",5.0
13,"May 25, 2011","I would like to thank Brad Johnson for helping me with the purchase of my new car from Legacy Ford.  He made the purchase so easy.  Brad, who is the General Sales Manager, went above and beyond to make sure I got the car I wanted for the price and payment that I needed.  I would highly recommend them to anyone looking for a new car.",5.0
