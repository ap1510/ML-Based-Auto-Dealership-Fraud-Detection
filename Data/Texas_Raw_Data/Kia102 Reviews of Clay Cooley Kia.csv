0,"June 06, 2020","My wife and I went to this dealership in December 2019 to purchase a Stinger GT for $32,000 with $10,000 down payment. Our credit wasn’t great but we needed a car after her accident a few weeks prior. Now that our credit is better we are ready to trade up to a Stinger GT1 at a different KIA Dealership. We knew that we had about $15,000 equity in our GT. After working numbers and getting ready to move forward we found that we had negative equity of $10,000. WHAT? Once the new KIA Dealership Salesman and I took a closer look at the paperwork, Cooley Kia increased the price of a 2019 Kia Stinger GT to $45,000. This dealership is crooked and I will not stop until they refund my money that I am owed or I will take this all the way to the top. Do not buy from this dealership.",1.0
1,"May 09, 2020","I moved to irving so I decided to take my car for service, went in for regular maintenance and other issues. I told the guy what was wrong. He come back with over $900 AC repair and the oil change 49.99. What about the issues. That would be an extra 149.00 for us to check. I wanted to walk away. I let them do the oil change and belt. The guy was not friendly at all. I would rather drive 25 miles to Mesquite to get excellent service. I will never return to Clay KIA. He did not offer any discounts. ",1.0

3,"February 24, 2020","I bought a used pre owned vehicle from Kia Clay Cooley. I bought a 2019 Nissan Sentra SV. I test drove it on 1/31 and on the dashboard appeared a notice that the front obstruction sensor was unavailable. Being a first time buyer and not knowing what that meant I asked the sales person. He said that it meant that there was nothing in front of my car, but there was nothing wrong with it. I didnt think anything else. I purchased the car, but it wasn’t until a week later that I noticed a light on the dashboard. I went back to Clay Cooley and talked to the sales person that sold me the car. The sales person, who had lied to me about the meaning of the message, told me that whether the sensor was working or not didn’t affect the car. He even said he didn’t know that the sensor wasn’t working or that there was a part behind the sensor that was bent which was causing the sensor to not work. Which angered me because 1) when someone is looking for a new car, that person looks at the features of the car and when one of the features of that car doesn’t work that does affect the car and 2) if you didn’t know what the message meant, you shouldn’t have said it was okay. We asked to speak to a manager. He told us to take it to a Nissan nearby to run a diagnostic on the car and that I should call the insurance company, an insurance I was persuaded to buy at the dealership, only to find out that it was not covered which he said it would be. The guy working at the Nissan service center told me that I was getting the run around because the dealership didn’t want to pay to fix the sensor because it was expensive, $1,300 to be exact. I called the manager he said to come back to the dealership and they would get me into something else, so we came back. The managers wanted to treat this as a trade in and didn’t want to give me the full amount that I had paid and gave me the whole “once you drive off the lot, your car loses it’s value” speech. I said it’s only been three weeks and the only reason that we are in this situation is because you gave me a car with a broken sensor and refuse to pay to fix it. They proceeded to give me the “you bought the car as is” speech which I said I bought that car under the impression that the sensor was working because your own sales person told me it was okay. The managers wanted to put me into a new car because I had a bad experience with a used car but this made my car payments double, which was not something I was interested in. We went back and forth and they eventually got the payments down to a lower price, but only this time when I looked at the paperwork it wasn’t even the same model as the car we test drove and we’re looking at it, which was very sketchy. Their excuse being that this car would give us less expensive payments. I was not satisfied and decided to leave. That is when the sales person said that his manager wanted to put me into another car that was the exact same car as the one I was in, I said okay. He left and came back with a car. I was looking the car over and something was off about this car, turns out this car wasn’t even the same car! That car was a Sentra while my car was a Sentra SV which is a step up from that car. I pointed that out and he went back inside to talk to his manager and came back around with a different car. This time this car had more miles and the engine sounded horrible! I was fed up with it all, at this point we had been at the dealership for SIX HOURS with no solution to my problem. Now I’m a very unsatisfied customer stuck with a contract with people that I no longer trust and a car with a sensor that doesn’t work and would cost $1,300 to fix. Very unhappy with my experience and the dealership as a whole.",1.0
4,"February 15, 2020","Hidden fees and bad customer service. Found the car I’ve wanted listed for a good price. Then found a hidden $1000 non-optional fee added along with a $150 document fee. When I told them I would purchase the car without the $1K added they just said “no, someone else will buy it if you don’t.” This was the sales manager and he acted like he could care less about a sale or me.

5,"January 09, 2020","Drove to the dealership to buy a 2019 Sorento advertised on their site on sale due to being a left over model from last year. Upon arrival we were informed that there had been a mistake with their third party site manager and too many rebates had been applied. He made sure to stress the disclaimer on the site stating they were not responsible for pricing mistakes. However, we were continuously assured that they could make the numbers work by adding value to the trade-in or being flexible on the actual price of the car, and were encouraged to take a test drive while they worked the numbers. Based on those assurances we took the test drive and checked out the car. Upon returning, we received their best offer:
$36k for the car
$16K for the trade
The price on the car was almost $10K from the price listed, and almost $4K from what the price was supposed to be even if the ""erroneous"" rebates were subtracted. We were absolutely floored.
As far as trade-in, before going to the dealer we called USAA who provided us with the Black Book values on our trade. The value for our car in worst condition was $20K, with an average value of $22K and a clean value of $25K. Our current car has outside imperfections like all used cars, but it is mechanically sound with a clean interior, almost new tires, and definitely does not qualify as ""rough"" condition. We understand that Black Book values are sale values, not trade-ins, so we were expecting a couple of grand off of the average value (around $19K - $20K). Hearing an offer $4K below the worst value was a second flabbergasting blow, especially after all of the assurances we had been given.
We understand that mistakes happen and we don't expect magic from a deal. However, we do expect honesty, transparency and fairness, and we don't feel like we got any of them. Had we been told upfront what the actual value of the car was, we would have been disappointed but understanding. However, being assured over and over that the numbers would work when we arrived so we would take the test drive, then getting numbers way off the mark afterwards, felt like a dishonest bait and switch tactic. We wasted an hour on a car well above our price range because of false advertising and false promises by a sales manager.
We left in shock and the more we thought about it the worse we felt about the experience. I attempted to call the dealership three times the following morning to speak to someone in management, but the phone was never answered. I looked at the ""Meet our staff"" section of their website for an email address, but none are listed. Further researching this dealership, is looks like I'm not the only one that has encountered these tactics with them.
The only positive notes I can give is that everyone was friendly, which in a way makes it worse because after the fact it just feels fake. I'll say that the sales guy (Joel I believe) seemed genuine and did a good job at answering questions while giving us space to look at the car.
TL/DR: Find somewhere else to buy a car. I'd say ""check pricing before you go"" but honestly I don't have any confidence that they wouldn't change it while you're there.",2.3

7,"November 19, 2019","If the pre-sales experience is any indicator, I can't imagine what the purchase experience must be like. I was following-up on a quote from one of their sales people earlier in the day. Ended-up on the line with a manager. During this short conversation was told the prior quote wasn't accurate. 

Then, without provocation, his tone changed and I was - ""talking to a manager now"" and he was ""putting me in my place"" (his words) with respect to their pricing. If I'm being kind, what followed could be described as a patronizing lecture - but more accurately, it was a berating. And I was ultimately hung-up on. Had I been angry or otherwise improper, perhaps this would be more easily understood? But I was just making a simple inquiry on a quote *they* provided ... still shaking my head and chuckling a bit.

They have many glowing reviews on Google, which we have no way of verifying, but seem likely to be fake. The experiences noted here are more aligned with my encounter. ",1.0
8,"September 09, 2019","Holy crap, buyer beware! If you are driving over 100 miles because you saw a great deal on a clean car, rest assured that it's bait and switch and they have NO intention of selling you the car. I've been working on a deal for a 2018 Kia Soul listed at $12,323 for 3 days. It's got 14,000 miles and is certified. Also it's under warranty and across from a new Kia car lot. As soon as I get there, the bullcrap starts. Saleswoman is already asking me if I'm open to looking at other cars, which I say NO. Then she goes to get the car to test drive by lo and behold, she brings a different car because the one I came for suddenly has a ""service"" issue. Manager comes out and says it's showing an error code and he's ""not comfortable"" selling it to me like that. Did I mention this is a 14,000 mile car under warranty? I can't believe I wasted my time on this crap. It's the oldest trick in the book and Clay Cooley should be ashamed at how his pre-owned lot is being ran. This is your warning everyone! Look at other reviews, it's the same stuff over and over and if I call a week from now, I guarantee that car will be described as good as new all over again until I get there. NEVER AGAIN with this crooked dealership. Can't wait for the canned reply from ""owner"" telling me how saddened they are. If y'all were really that concerned, you would stop underhanded, stereotypical selling tactics.

Edit: Now the car is listed at $13,523. Over $1000 higher than when I was there and they wouldn't sell it. These people are so full of crap.",1.6
9,"March 02, 2019","We knew exactly what we wanted when we walked in, easiest sale they could ever make. The problems started in Finance. We were offered a deal and accepted it. A few days later, we were told that deal ""fell through"" but they could offer another deal, at a higher interest rate. Fine, we took that deal. Two weeks later, yep, that deal also ""fell through."" Finally a third deal was offered, at an even higher interest rate. We had this vehicle for over three weeks before the deal was actually finalized. This dealership is an absolute joke, I wouldn't recommend that anyone go there for any reason, even to make a u-turn in the parking lot. ",1.0

11,"January 10, 2019","These people are probably the worse car dealership I have ever had the misfortune to have to deal with, Finance department ( BAD PEOPLE ) sold my young 20 year old son a car with him signing my name to finance agreement after telling him,   "" This is needed to start the sale process "" Complete CRAP!    when I found out this bum Bobby did this fraud deal, Sending me blank Fedx papers after he received the finance money, he simply say's, I DON'T WANT THE CAR BACK, Oh, And his boss Sonny the idiot who manages this other moron said, DADDY CHANGED HIS MIND?"" how dare you say that you unprofessional thief!  After many calls with no returns after they financed the fraud deal with ALLY FINANCE, I finally found a lady, Juanita ...maybe a manager that told me ""My son should be arrested?"" Where you dropped on your head lady?  well after contacting a fraud atty I had great options but these crooks finally paid off the loan and returned the boy's trade in, minus his sound system removed from car, I did secure the car he needed with EWALD GMC in Wisconsin, where I live and had the BEST service and great deal on a better car.

12,"December 17, 2018",This dealership should be shut down. I paid cash for my car only to have them tow it while I was a the grocery store. They said I still owed $3500. I DID NOT. Instead of calling they choice to illegally tow it. Then I had to fight to get somebody to check the accounting. Once they figure they were wrong. They could not find my car. When they brought it to me the wheel was warped. The tow truck.pulled it out of the parking space sideways. I was paralleled parked. They had the nerve to bring me back the car that the tire was warped and wobbled when I drove it also they stole my prescription sunglasses and cell phone out of the car. This place is evil they are liars they're thieves they're counting practice should be outlawed. Do some math on your contract and find out that they added extra insurance without telling you. If you bought an as is car. Check the numbers.....you have a good experience but if you get a bad one you will pay.. save yourself the worry there's other dealerships..record all conversations you will need it when they lie to you.

14,"August 05, 2018","BUYER BEWARE!!!! I stopped in to have my Kia Soul serviced. The engine light had been on and it was determined that two sensors were bad and needed to be replaced. Although I was treated very nicely by the Service agent and the evaluation of my vehicle was serviced properly, it was very expensive compared to local repair shops. I don't mind paying extra for the Kia parts and trained mechanics, but I was charged more than double. My biggest complaint was when I was waiting for my vehicle to be serviced the salesmen were speaking to each other and using very foul language. This is very unprofessional I would never buy any vehicle from these salesmen. VERY UNPROFESSIONAL SALESMEN!

The GM asked me to respond to him below and I did. No Response! 

It has been a month since I have emailed the GM about my poor experience at your dealership. He ask for me to email you with the details, and I did last month. 

Being a manager of a country club, if I ask someone to email me with details, I get back to them as soon as possible. I am apologetic and empathize with anyone who has an unfortunate experience with my staff. 

Based on the way you have handled my situation, I have to believe that your staff is allowed to act rudely because you don’t lead and instruct them properly. 

I guess my review of your business is spot on.",2.0
15,"April 04, 2018","First they sold me a car with 4000 miles more than the odometer contract. Against the law. Second because my credit was bad the said they had to add $2000 to the price of the car just flat out $2000 and blamed it on the bank and a finance rate at 15.3 I was told 12.4.. after the sales man gave his reason for  the $2000 the Manager walk in a forcefully said this car has no warranty it's a buy as is.  That was not on the window sticker. He made me sign an agreement for no warranty. Then I go to financing and he goes over the paperwork. First thing out if his mouth was I had a 60,000 or 6 yr cars warrenty. When I ask about it he said it was built into the price of the car. I said do I'm paying for it again he said it was built in. I said take it off and the payment went down $50 which was a total of $4000. But one how the price of the car did not come down. They tell me me warranty I pay $2000 for bank reasons manager makes me sign away any warrenty on the car after they stick the insurance without my knowing into the price of the car. Complete bareface like. On my way home I ran out of gas theres was no windshield wiper fluid and the oil was low. The car had 6400 miles. They were the only owners so they never checked under the hood. . When I noticed the milage was wrong I took the car back because the contract was void. So I got another cartbibking after all that they would be honest with this car. So to cut all the trickery i decided to pay cash I put $7000 on my credit card then they bring me the contract and tell me they couldn't take my check because of my credit. So they let me charge on credit $7000 but my money was no good. I left without paying the remaining balance with the new car. I waited in the lobby for 30 they said the car was being cleaned and gassed up. 30 min later at 1015pm they bring me the car they get into there car and. The gas light is on warning me about no gas. I had to coste into the gas station down the road..when I asked for the spare key they said the previous owner did bring  it so I'd have to pay $300 dollars for one. That funny because the  car only had 1600 Mike's  and they are the only owners. So where's the key. And I've asked for the window sticker which is a law to give it to me. I know there was no buy as is or no warrenty sticker. .I'm going back this morning  to pay in cash actual dollar bills. I bet that money will be good  I'll report back to see how I'm treated. Will they reimburse me for gas and offer to wash it. Oh and they have ran my credit 5 times for a car in trying to pay cash for....DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PLACE. THEY ARE BULLIES LIARS RUTHLESS AND CHEATS. YOU GET NO PERKS NO EXTRA KEY THEY CHEAT YOU OUT OF WARRINTIES NO GAS NO CAR WASH. ",1.0

They lie through their teeth the moment you walk in and they don’t stop. I bought a car from them in June of 2016 with 3,000 miles on it and since, I have had said car sent back to them within the week of buying for A/C issues, had to fight with them to give me the spare key that came with the car, and have STILL yet to receive ANY of my contract or information on the $2,500 warranty I was bullied into.

I never got a copy of contract details and when I noticed the discrepancy, 1 week later, I was sent in circles trying to get resolution. By now it was time for first payment. After speaking to several GM? Iwas told nothing could be done to rectify this mistake. So, I paid an extra $2000 for a vehicle and apparently noone cared about my issue.

19,"August 30, 2017","We live in West Texas 95% of the time and the other 5% of the time. I get online and look for cars at the car lot well i liked a few but know our budget right now and with bad credit you would have to have atleast 2,000.00. Well my husband was approved for the fresh start program but we are in West Texas. So he asked his boss of so we could go get a car from Clay Cooley Kia of Irving and his boss let him off for one day to go get the car. Well they already know we wouldnt be able to put anything down till we got there and we told them okay. So I texted the salesman today and he tells me that if we put a 1,000.00 it would hold the car. Well a little while later he says i taljed to my manager and if you put 500.00 diwn we can hold the car. Mind you its a fresh start program car he also told my husband uncle because he lives in Richardson and was going to look at it for us its a Chevy Captiva S 2013 with 83,031 miles on it. Well we were told it was a 3 year program and his uncle was told a 4 year program. Well we have already been slapped in the face by Toyota of Midland so we dont trust car dealerships at this point well when i dont get a response from the salesman i already know your dealership didn't care for their customers. So i tell my husbands uncle that the salesman said that now they said a 1,000.00 and come in tonight. Okay sorry yall already know our situation and we live like 5 hours away and yall all were told that we have to do this mostly over the phone till we get to the nitty gritty but yall just didnt care after knowing that my husband would have to talk to his boss and then do a ce sign get the car and drive back to work the next night. Plus yall were wishy washy with you can put 500.00 down and it would hold it to you have to put a 1,000.00 down to hold it to no you have to come in today. WOW!!! So my husband uncle called to find out what was going on and you changed the story on him also. Guess I will be blasting yall on social media also with Toyota Of Midland. If yall didnt know every time a credit check is ran it brings your credit score down even more yall ran his a bunch of times also. So by now his credit score is crap and now we cant get a vehicle till his score goes back up. Oh who cares about the credit score yall sure dont and neither did Toyota Of Midland.

20,"July 18, 2017","This place is complete garbage.  Customer Service sucks.  Apparently they have 5 different GM's because I never actually got to speak with one.  Every time I called I got transferred to someone's voicemail and never received a call back.  I purchased a vehicle back in March. The lady that does all the paperwork for the cars is a complete jerk and she knew she was ripping me off.  Didn't receive any of the paperwork I signed when I left.  I asked where the paperwork was and my salesman told me I would receive it in the mail (never did). So I had to call back up there and that was a whole process to talk to the lady and receive the copies.  I go up to the dealership she hands me an envelope with SOME of the paperwork in there and nothing on that copy was signed by me.  So I contacted my salesman because if I talked to that lady one more time I was going to be so pissed.  He finally gives me all the paperwork that I filled out and signed (mind you this is well over 30 days after I purchased my vehicle).  Then, the last two papers I know that lady forged my signature because I remember never seeing those two papers when we sat down in the office that night signing everything.  They were the stupid warranty papers.  I could go on about that lady and my salesman I won't waste my time.  Don't waste your time by going there either.  The whole ordeal with them was absolutely awful. I got scammed and they were incredibly impossible to get a hold of/work with.  I will never step foot in this dealership again.

22,"June 14, 2017","I can't begin to explain the constant stress these people have caused me and my family. You always hear about car dealerships ripping people off but I wouldn't think that a reputable dealership such as this would do any and everything to steal from its consumers. Not only did we get 2!...thats right 2 junk cars back to back but we also got scammed into purchasing a used car opposed to paying the same payment for a new car.
We purchased a Kia optima last year on a Saturday. Before we even made it home it was already making a strange noise under the hood. We really didn't get to test drive it like we should've because of course they didn't put enough gas in it. Well by Monday the car had over heated and was engulfed in smoke. We took it back to Clay Cooley in which they constantly insisted that it just had too much oil and that the car was fine. Well being a mother and someone who drives on the highway to and from work I didn't feel safe in the vehicle. So finally after I had to basically argue with them because I was frustrated and my kids were tired of being up there all day they put me in another optima.
Well fast forward a few months later and to no surprise the new Optima they put me in has over $1,800 worth of mechanical issues. Which of course supposedly isn't covered under my warranty or extended warranty. The saddest thing about all of this is we were looking for a bigger car for our family but really didn't need to get one right away but we took a chance with Clay Cooley instead of Southwest Kia which we never had a problem with them with our previous car purchases.
If you are looking to purchase a Kia go to Southwest Kia. They won't put you in a junk car or swindle you into buying one. 

And to the salesman who pressured me into writing a review right away...here you go!

The fact is I went to Central Kia of Irving because my younger sister told me... How good they were. I planned on meeting with Renea  Milton. My plan was....I would look around. I would thank her for her time and head to another dealership down the road where I had brought another vehicle. She pulled up in a Black 14 Sportage.  When I drove the car . I knew it was the one. I got the payments right around what I wanted. 

You'll see other reviews saying it was the greatest car buying experience from start to finish. The fact is my sister and niece have purchase a car from Central Kia.  The fact is Renea didn't get the sale because she knows them. Renea got the sale because she earned my business.   ",5.0

I was not going to buy another tote the note car. But I had never bought a new car before, so you can imagine how nervous I was going in to a dealer, and not knowing what to expect.
I had already made up my mind, what car I wanted, but other than that, I had no clue as to what I could do. Met with Leo, went over several options to meet my needs. Came to the conclusion that new was the best idea for me. As Leo coached me through the test drive, I was caught by his honest love for the car I was testing. Not only did he inform me of all the features, but even took the time to tell me about the advancements they have made on the Soul over the past years.
Test drive done, decision made, time to meet Mrs. B.
A true god send for a man as nervous as I. She asked what I was looking to pay, I answered. After  a few minutes, she showed me a list of extra coverages and said you can have all this and keep your payment below what you wanted. I was so comforted and pleased with my experience.
No issues, no run around, even put me in a loaner for the weekend.

When I got to the dealership I was met by Herman M. and told him that I had recieved an email from Gene and decided to come and see if I could get into a 2014 Sorento on a lease (or a purchase vehicle if it would be cheaper).  It only took about 10 minutes for Herman to tell me that they COULD get me into a purchase on a 2013 Rio, Soul or Forte.  I told Herman that I would rather have a Forte, at which time he took me out and showed me a beautiful black Kia Forte and it was love at first site.  I told him when we initially talked that I didn't want my payments to go up anymore than they already were.  When I saw this car and all the features it had to offer, I just knew that my payments would be through the roof.  After a quick test drive, Herman left to get the numbers on the car.  After only 10 minutes he came back and told me that they would give me a great deal (really great if you ask me) on my trade in and my payments would only be slightly higher than my current car payment.  Herman took me in and introduced me to the most WONDERFUL lady I have ever met - Ms. B (Bethany).  She was my saving grace.  I have been in a rough place and used to things not going my way (or in a positive direction) and Ms. B made me feel like I was her very best friend.

Ms B. is very caring - you can tell that she means what she says.  She always had a smile on her face and assured me that I would not have to worry about anything.  She told me that she would make sure that everything was taken care of and if I needed anything at all, to call her.  Herman introduced me to everyone in the dealership and everyone I met was friendly, nice and had a smile on their face.

Then they emailed us and said they wanted to buy it back and put us in a new car. We called set everything up, they even ran our credit and said they could get us in a new one for nothing down. Drove 2 hours up there and sat for almost 2 hours for them to tell us they couldn't put us in anything new or used with nothing down an the minimum we would have to have was $1000.

85,"June 04, 2012","My husband and I were in search of trading our older model vehicle for something more resourceful for our families needs. Not knowing where we stood in the ""line of credit"" we were very sceptical about actually being able to use our vehicle for a trade in, let alone qualify for a newer vehicle. As of June 2, 2012 we are now in a 2012 Kia Sedona!! Thank you Randy from start to finish you were awesome! Never have we had such a great experience in purchasing a new/vehicle! It was the most painless, enjoyable, and over all just WOW! Thanks again Randy!!!!

Randy was patient, friendly, knowledgeable and got me the car I wanted for an awesome price! My dad was also very pleased! I would definitely recommend this central Kia of Irving and Randy August to all my family and friends! Love my car! Thanks Randy aka The Great One :)))",5.0
87,"May 16, 2012","I was interested in a new vehicle I had seen advertised. When I inquired to purchase, they said yes they still had that vehicle available and quoted a price $1500 higher than their advertised priced. When I pointed this out, they said it was because the advertised price included a $500 military incentive discount that I didn't qualify for (I qualified for all other possible incentives). They wanted to completely ignore addressing the other $1000 difference which made them that much higher than other dealers and tried to change the subject rather than address it. It was clear this is a shady, deceptive business, so I left before they could even get to the part where I'm almost sure they would have tried to add even more as some sort of doc fee or processing charge. I'm still buying a Kia, but it will be from a different dealer that doesn't play these games.",1.5
88,"May 09, 2012","We had never considered the Kia Optima before a friend had told us about it.  We went and test drove it and were sold!  I can't thank Herman and Peter enough -- they were OUTSTANDING to work with!  They were very customer service oriented and worked hard to meet our criteria in what we were looking for.  The entire process from the test drive, to multiple phone conversations, sale, and satisfaction follow-up was much easier when working with these gentlemen.  I would definetely recommend them to family and friends! ",5.0

90,"April 17, 2012","After a bad experience with a Ford dealership in the area late last year, my experience at Central Kia was excellent. Randy in particular was a joy to work with. He listened to my concerns, followed up with me through the process of deciding if I really wanted to trade in my truck, and showed me several options. He addressed some reservations I had, got me a great deal on my trade, and even surprised me by recommending a car I hadn't really considered, but turns out to be just perfect for my needs and taste. Everybody at Central Kia, from reception to sales to finance, were unfailingly friendly, professional, and best of all, communicative. When working on a major financial decision and transaction, the worst part is the waiting for answers. Other car dealerships have left me hanging for hours or even days with no communication or consideration for my time. The staff at Central Kia were very respectful, and I'm thrilled with my sharp little Forte Koup. I'd recommend this car, this company, this location, and Randy to anybody looking for a new vehicle. These folks really ""get it"".",5.0

92,"February 06, 2012","I have never had a worse experience with a car dealership. My husband and I found Central Kia online and were impressed with the number of 2012 Kia Souls they had to offer so he started dealing with Chad by phone. Chad assured us he had the perfect Soul to meet our needs and would be happy to work something out for our trade. We live over 300 miles away in Odessa so it was agreed that we would come in on Saturday, February 4th. Chad called us when we were about 2 hours away from Irving to be sure that we were still coming in. After driving 5 hours to get to the dealership we were told that the car we came to buy had already been sold. To add insult to injury we were told by Larry Alton &quot;You could have paid a deposit and we would have held the car&quot; this option was never presented to us. However, Larry assured us that he would get us a great deal on another vehicle. Of course the only other options they had were above our price range but we were told not to worry about it, they would &quot;work something out&quot; so Chad picked out a car and we took it for a test drive. During the test drive Chad asked us to stop at a McDonalds right down the street from the dealership because according to him he &quot;was dehydrated from last night.&quot; When we got back to the dealership we expressed our concerns about the vehicle being too far out of our price range so Larry took us back out to the lot and we found a different model that was priced still out of our range, but a little cheaper and again we were assured that since we drove that far they would help us get a great deal. When we started working on the financing we were again taken to Larry's office to discuss our trade. His suggestion was to ask us if we planned on staying married, we were confused but he then said, &quot;If I were you I wouldn't wouldn't trade it in, why not just let it go back to the bank?&quot; We were beyond irritated at this point. We told him that this was not an even option for us to consider. So we sat and waited for over an hour for them to &quot;work it out&quot; and after several back and forth offers we finally decided to walk away without buying a car. After sitting at this dealership for 3 hours being lied to, dealing with a salesman still recovering from a long night (this is the best way I can word it according to terms of use) who spent the entire time we were there talking about &quot;partying&quot;, clubs and insulting our hometown, then being insulted by Larry's &quot;option&quot; on our trade, and still not getting the &quot;deal of a lifetime&quot; that were assured would happen we left the dealership angry, frustrated and without a car.

93,"November 01, 2011","I never knew buying a car could be considered a pleasant experience but that is exactly how I would describe my experience with Central Kia in Irving, TX. Two months ago I purchased a KIA Forte from them for my daughter and had previously that day spent hours on the phone with several Kia dealers. I was able to get a 2012 EX at Central Kia for the same price a Southwest dealership was charging me for a 2011 LX. Central Kia in Irving gave me the best price from the very beginning.  I even had one Southwest Kia dealer tell my daughter they could not match the price.  Wow! Melissa Juarez was the one that assisted me on the phone (off and on ALL day, I must add).  Never once did she even seem frustrated with me.  She was kind, professional, and incredibly patience.  My daughter loves her Kia Forte.  I also want to add that it took only about 2 hours & 45 minutes from the time we walked through the doors to complete the entire process.  That in itself is amazing.  In fact my husband and I were so amazed that this past weekend we went back to Central Kia and purchased a Kia Optima for ourselves.  I love it. This time we had the privilege of working with Randy August.  Thank you Randy for another pleasant experience. This time the whole process took a total of 2 hours and 45 minutes and the exciting thing was I bought the beautiful pearl white model on the showroom floor! I absolutely love it.
Thank you Central Kia of Irving, TX.  I don't think I'll be back again in 2 months, though;  however, when I need another car...I know where to come.",5.0

95,"September 06, 2011","After visiting many other Kia dealerships across the metroplex I found that Central Kia of Irving was the most professional, curteous and took out the time to actually meet the needs of the customer. The dealership didn't place restrictions on the vehicle of my choice neither did the process take three or four hours to tell you how you couldn't get into the vehicle you wanted. The sales manager Larry Alton and salesman Jeff Warfield took less than an hour in assisting me in getting the vehicle I wanted, the price, and the color. The owner should be very proud of the staff that he has at Central Kia of Irving.

97,"August 17, 2011","I purchased my new Kia Forte nearly 3 months ago. I stopped into the main office unscheduled to see about an extra key, then head back to the service department to inquire about my first checkup. Upon entering the main office I was welcomed by my salesperson Jeff Warfield who, amazingly, greeted me by name...after nearly 3 months!!! What a welcomed feeling he presented. I appreciate that I meant enough to him and to Kia that I would be remembered by name!

Mr. Warfield found my spare key for me, then personally escorted me across the parking lot to talk to the service department. Once he was certain my questions were adequately addressed he cordially returned with me to the main office and I was on my way.

If Jeff Warfield is representative of how Central Kia of Irving conducts business I strongly recommend this dealership and Jeff! Jeff and Central Kia have earned my respect and trust.

100,"July 09, 2010","Over the past couple of years, I have gone through several cars for many different reasons.  I am brand new to Texas and it’s very intense because there are a million different choices of dealerships to purchase from.  Thanks to the internet (I have no idea what we did before the invention of) the initial searches were made simple.  After viewing Central Kia of Irving’s website as well as reviews placed by others I felt certain that this was the place.  I made the trip up from Waxahachie to view the cars and speak with someone in person.  From the time I arrived to the time I closed on my new 2010 Kia Optima, it was a world class encounter.  I would very much suggest them to anyone searching for a good quality car at a great price!       ",5.0
