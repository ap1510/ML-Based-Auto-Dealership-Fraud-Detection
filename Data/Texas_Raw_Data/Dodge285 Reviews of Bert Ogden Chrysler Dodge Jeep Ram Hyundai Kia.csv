0,"June 01, 2020","So far my experience with the Bert Ogden Service writers and Service team have been nothing to boast about. I am 1 phone call away from going to the Service Supervisor. My vehicle has been in the shop for over 20 days and I was told that I would need a new engine. I have yet to get a claim number or order number from them so I can get a rental car. Also was told by the service writer that the engine is back ordered and apparently has not been ordered yet. This whole time I have only received 3 phone calls from my service writer. I have had to reach out to her several times only to get no where. 
She has no customer service skills and does not follow through with what she promises.
I can not rate the quality of work BECAUSE MY TRUCK IS STILL SITTING IN THEIR PARKING LOT.
23 days in and they finally ordered a motor but can not give me an estimated time when this truck will be fixed. Motor is back ordered! Still did not offer to help get me into a loaner or rental car. Having to do this myself. Customer service skills....zero!",1.0
1,"October 04, 2019","It took 1 trip to Bert Ogden Kia in McAllen, Tx. & 3 trips to Bert Ogden in Harlingen, Tx. to get my A/C worked on. My A/C still isn't working right, at highway speed it only gets cool, City driving it does get cold. This is a 2019 kia Niro. The vehicle always got cold at highway or city speeds. I've driven over 200 miles total to get the A/C repaired & will never recommend Bert Ogden dealerships when buying or servicing any vehicle. I also called Kia U.S.A. to complain & they put me on hold while they called the dealership & the dealership told them they didn't know me or never worked on my vehicle,, the funny thing was as soon as I hung up from the complaint dept. the dealership called me to bring my car in for the repairs.",1.5

78,"January 13, 2017","This was the best vehicle buying experience I have ever had.  From the very beginning Tony (Turbo) was there to greet us but the one thing I found refreshing is that he didn't push us into anything. He introduced himself and stated that if we had any questions about any vehicle he would be right there to answer them.  We, my wife and I, actually got to walk around and look freely.  Tony took care of everything up until he handed us off to the Finance Manager, Sergio.  He too was awesome by explaining to us all the different types of packages we could get in order to protect our vehicle and so forth.  If we stated we didn't want a particular item, it was no problem and Sergio moved on and didn't try hounding us to purchase it even though we didn't want it.  After we were through with Sergio we were handed back off to Tony who had our vehicle waiting for us already washed and gassed up.  Tony explained how all the bells and whistles worked.

He was very helpful and stuck with my through the couple of weeks that I was making my decision.  I never felt threatened with having to buy the car the same day I was there.  It was a relief compared with other dealers that  visually showed discontent when I told them that I was shopping around and left.  Only some dealers kept contact with me through the process but the friendliest and most helpful of them all was the salesman at this dealer.  I highly recommend this dealer for purchasing and servicing a new car.,5.0

130,"October 01, 2016","I have had a very negative experience with Bert Ogden Harlingen Kia. My experience is strictly from buying vehicles, and does not involve the Service department. 
Used to be a loyal customer, but will never set foot inside this dealership. The staff does not value customer relationships, loyalty and experience. Also, has no business integrity, ONLY focused on bottom line and ripping customers off. In spite of being a loyal customer, looking to trade a one year old Kia sedan (9 K miles that was bought brand new from same dealership) for a bigger vehicle, dealership did not provide any kind of assistance. We could not make the trade work, and I had to go to a different dealership in Corpus Christi where it made much more sense. In my time of need, Bert Ogden Harlingen KIA was a HUGE let-down. My experience consisted   of deception, dishonest managers, and false advertising (will not go into details) It is said that the hardest part is to bring the customer in through the front door. In my case, I had been there 3 times for the same vehicle over a 3 month span to work something out that would make sense for both customer and dealership. Instead, it was a LOSS-LOSS scenario for me. I was treated only as a financial transaction with $$ signs on my forehead. I am extremely disappointed in the whole process. I would rather make the drive somewhere else than work with this dealership ever again. I would give it 0 stars, if possible. 
P.S Do not put an automated response, trying to ""follow-up"". Instead, use that time to train staff on business ethics and customer relationships .

Instead, the numbers were cautiously high but within the reasonable range for a person with below average credit.  Fair and Trustworthy. See for yourself.",5.0
221,"March 03, 2016","Could not make an appointment to have checked. Said we'd have to leave pickup. We just bought the truck in November. A seal is probably loose. Also we checked because the wrong wiring pig tale for auxiliary brake control was for a 2012 vehicle ours is 2015 so would not plug in, wanted to sell me a $200  plus control made for my truck.  Thought of buying second vehicle for wife now I'm reconsidering if can't get service.  We had a Toyota bought from you before we traded.   Had much better service downtown at your dealership.  Was told I had an attitude after waiting an hour and left.",2.8
222,"February 24, 2016","We bought our new mini van through them just a few months ago. We love our vehicle but next time we'll drive up to San Antonio. The sales process was fairly smooth up until  the day before we were scheduled to pick up our vehicle. They explained the Kia rebates wouldn't qualify for our vehicle since it was used as a ""loaner"" and thus not considered new. Conveniently for them, all the other vehicles we considered after that were more expensive (even with the rebates). So we ended up purchasing the ""loaner van"" and after starting the paperwork, we noticed cracks in the windshield. They scheduled for us to come in the following week at 8 am to the service dept. We show up only to find out they hadn't even ordered it. The final straw was our trade in. We just had made a payment on our trade in however the dealership didn't send the payoff until a month later so we owed another payment on a vehicle that wasn't even in our possession. We're still waiting on getting the re-reimbursement from Kia. Every sales, service and financing person who gave us their business card and told us to call them for ""anything"" has been unresponsive and over promises and then doesn't deliver. I would definitely take my money elsewhere.",1.4

274,"July 28, 2015","My 2015 Ram 1500 Ecodiesel broke down on me at 10,500 miles. The truck has been sitting on the lot for over a month now and I have still not been given any information as to when my truck will be fixed. All they told me was they found a few small red flags within the engine but long story short it needed a new engine. The process just to find out if my warranty and extended warranty would cover the damages took 2-3 weeks. This should not have even been a question as most vehicles with engine failure at 10,500 miles are just poorly manufactured. I would NOT recommend this dealership as they like to jerk you around, hand you off to another employee, and tell you what you want to hear. I was promised follow up calls every time I called and only heard from them when I called to get an update myself. Horrible customer service do not waste your time with them.",1.0

283,"March 11, 2015","Submitted an online application after speaking with a salesman by the name of Joshua M., he stated that he would get back with me. 4 hours later, never heard from him so I called and spoke to him and his answer to not calling  me back was, ""oh you did it!"" Obviously I was a little upset so I called the dealership and requested that I speak with the dealerships management,  I spoke to Justin who stated he would talk to his people about this, then I had some guy named Cruz, who was obviously upset and always cut me off when I was trying to say something. He promised customer service but what I got was less than the other salesman Joshua, needless to say, he never called be back as well. 

I know my credit is not and I may have been nothing to the people of Bert Ogden in Harlingen but I never go back to them for anything.
