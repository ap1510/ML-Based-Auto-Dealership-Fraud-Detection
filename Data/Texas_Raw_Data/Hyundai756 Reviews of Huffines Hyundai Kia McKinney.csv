0,"April 14, 2020","Just finished buying a 2020 Tucson Sport from David Harrison.  David is professional, easy going, not pushy, listens to what was important to me, and made the process quick, simple, and easy.

The numbers quoted before I got there were the same numbers when arriving at the dealership.  There was none of they typical dealership smoke and mirrors about ""gee when we gave you that price on the phone, we didn't know that the invisible zombie repellent has already been applied, so that's why the price is higher"".

When my 1st choice of colors, which had been in stock sold on Saturday, the sales director (Scott Feinstein) even upped their already generous discount because of having to settle for the 2nd choice color,  without me even asking!  When's the last time you had something like THAT happen when buying a car???

When signing papers, the finance director (Brian Smallwood,) was not pushy, answered questions factually, and there were no horror story scare tactics.  I normally don't buy things like GAP insurance and the extended warranties, because it always seems like the person I'm signing papers with had decided they are going to put a kid through medical school on what they make on what I buy.  Prices for that stuff at Huffines Hyundai McKinney were so reasonable both GAP and an extended warranty were priced reasonably enough that I thought both were a good deal.

When it comes to feeling like a dealership is treating you like you're a relative of the owner, the expensive dealerships with names that rhyme with ""jewel"" or ""zest"" are merely wannabe starter kits of what the folks at Huffines Hyundai McKinney are.  My experiences with Huffines dealerships have always been good, but with their Hyundai dealership in McKinney, it was good squared and cubed.

You have 2 choices, buy anywhere else, and have that reoccurring ""somebody safe me ""experience that perpetuates the stereotypes of car dealerships, or buy from David Harrison at Huffines Hyundai McKinney.",5.0
1,"February 29, 2020",If I could give 10 stars out of 5 I would! This dealership is phenomenal! They have a very courteous and kind sales staff! Very knowledgable! Martin Houston is the man! Nobody is better! His managers Frank White and Ben Fernandez did everything they could to get me the deal I wanted. I am so impressed and will definitely be returning!,5.0
2,"February 07, 2020","Th Huffines Kia McKinney dealership is exceptionally good. I recently purchased a new Telluride, and the entire experience was great. Michael Lang, my salesman, was awesome. Also, sales manager, Frank White, was very helpful. I highly recommend Huffines Kia McKinney!     Dan Spain",5.0
3,"January 27, 2020","Anthony Macpherson was our sales person and he was absolutely wonderful.  We'd shopped online for days and had three dealerships lined up to go test drive cars.  We went to Huffines Hyundai McKinney first, Anthony had the cars ready to drive, he was very helpful, knowledgeable and upfront about every detail.  The price was good, the cars where exactly as described and there was no pressure and NO GAMES!  We love the car and feel great about our purchase.  Anthony and Huffines Hyundai McKinney will be our first recommendation to all our friends and family.",5.0
4,"October 07, 2019","What a crap experience, first they tricked me to buy their ""care"" packages which is completely useless. I was a first time buyer and they xxxxx me good.  Now after a few months of dealing with them on warranty issues(lemon car) I will NEVER SET MY FOOT IN A DEALERSHIP WITH THE Huffines name on it ever again. In addition I will let anyone I know buying cars to stay away from Huffines. Good thing these stealerships are slowly going out of business as carvanas and similar non traditional dealerships are popping up everywhere.",1.0
5,"July 23, 2019","My daughter and I just dropped by at Huffines Kia Mckinney. Wasn't planning on buying that day but, the deals were so great I couldn't walk away. Everyone was so helpful. Not pushy. Listened to what I needed and they went to work. My sales person was Veerendra Kaja. He is awesome.  Check out Huffines Kia Mckinney! Brenda Caddell",5.0
6,"July 18, 2019","I took my Hyundai to the Service Center.  I took it on a Saturday and it is now next Thursday ( poor communication and they never expained that the part they used was defective.  They also have poor communication and use remanufactured parts!  DON'T GO THERE!  EVER!  I had to call every day and then when I called the Huffines main office and the administrative assistant said she would get Mr. Huffines to assist me - she sent me back to the Mckinney Office that I was having problems with in the first place.  I purchased my car from Mckinney Hyundai, I just had work done, now I am having more work done and they DO NOT care about repeat customers or their customers at all. It gives my NO pleasure to write a poor review but the community must be warned about businesses like this one.",1.2
7,"July 18, 2019","Was shopping for CPO Genesis.......
STRIKE 1. Made appointment to see two cars (2016 Genesis) - Got there and was told they were not in inventory and they didn't know that until I was waiting to see the cars.  
-Was told another one just came in (matching my criteria) - was at Plano Huffines and could be brought up (was not in inventory yet and had not been made ready)  no problem.  
Liked the car and bought it on Saturday (6-8-19).  I bought a protection package for interior and exterior, extended service warranty and window tinting (which was given for no cost (thank you) .  Car would be ready Thursday (time to fix minor body damage and cracked windshield, put tint on windows and apply the interior and exterior protection products)
-Picked the car up Thursday and drove home- pretty excited...these are nice cars and this had all the bells and whistles and looked sharp

STRIKE 2. Noticed the driver seat was dirty (seats are almost white) - I saw the smudges and dirtiness (not bad, but noticeable)  when I first looked at the car, but thought it odd that this wasn't cleaned up when they readied the car and applied the protection package.
I then looked under the hood (should have done this prior to buying...stupid me) - the engine compartment was VERY dirty with leaves, dust and debris .  Took pictures (which I wish I could include here) and sent to the sales person (Jerry Blow) .  Told me in email ""The engine compartments are not detailed due to the risk of water damage to components""
I then told him about the dirty seat - he then said the ""Smart Shield"" was not applied and I should bring it back at my convenience.  Glad I asked.....This package is a bit pricey for what it is.  How was this overlooked?????

STRIKE 3 - THIS IS A BIG ONE-  I bought this car at a Hyundai dealership specifically to get a Certified Pre Owned (CPO) vehicle .  I was given a brochure telling me how great the CPO program was with nearly 173 inspection points.   
Because of the dustiness / dirtiness of the engine compartment something really stuck out.  Did they even check the air filter????  This filter is a pain to inspect- there is a bar across it that had to be removed ( bolts on either end) and there was no sign in the dust that it had been touched, let alone inspected.  Surely this is on the CPO checklist
I looked into the CPO process further and discovered that before the car can be CPO approved, there is a comprehensive checklist that must be completed and signed by 4 authorized people- technician who did the checks, the service manager, the CPO program manager and finally the customer.   THIS WAS NOT DONE and, until I dug into it, I did not know this was a key document in the sales process!!!!!!!!!  
                                        How did it get CPO certified and sold without this being done
                                                            TALK ABOUT LOSING ALL TRUST

- I brought the car back for the Smart Shield application and a complete CPO inspection - they had the car for a couple of days and provided a NC loan vehicle.  Got the car back and signed the CPO document (Service Manager was very attentive and professional - (Tony Saif) 

STRIKE 4 - It's been 6 weeks since I bought the car.  Thought it was odd that I had not gotten my plates / registration.  
Called yesterday (7-17-19) to get status update.  Oh! the car should have been inspected when it up there last time- I could bring back there or go somewhere locally and they would reimburse me the cost of the inspection.  
NO PAPERWORK WAS SUBMITTED because of this - no call, email or text telling me they dropped the ball again.  What the heck......

I was actually pretty mad and was going to contact Mr. Huffines to let him know the bevy of problems and mistakes at this dealership, but my wife advised me to 1st call the sales manager to see if he was aware of the problems, etc associated with this sale.  Called and (as he would not be in till the afternoon), requested he (Ben Hagan) call me back.  NO CALL BACK.  Did he get the message ???- super nice guy , but .........

So those are the reasons for this poor review.  Would you buy a vehicle with this kind of service, response and attention to detail????   I know there are better places to go (the car is really nice) ",2.2
8,"June 30, 2019","I just purchased a used 2015 kia k900. Upon detailing and delivery I found out the floor mats had been stolen from my vehicle. The dealership refused to replace them, but wanted  $260.00 to order new floor mats from the manufacturer. Since this purchase was ""As Is"" I'm just stuck with the loss. Buyer beware..",1.0
9,"March 03, 2019",I could not be happier with my experience with Huffines McKinney. Michael Lang was my sales guy and went out of his way to make sure I was blown away with the vehicle and service of everyone at the dealership. I would never hesitate to recommend Huffines Hyundai McKinney to anyone. ,4.8
10,"December 30, 2018","Levani Neidiradze. answered all of our questions about the vehicle we were interested in. He was very knowledgeable about all of the vehicles features and took the time to show us how everything worked. Levani gave us time to think about which one we wanted, and when we made our decision he located the vehicle,  picked it up for us, and worked around our busy schedules to have it ready at the time we could pick it up. He was always professional and took the time to help us with our purchase.",5.0

12,"September 01, 2018","Daniel Kadar went above and beyond to make our car purchasing experience an excellent one. In every step of the process, he ensured that we knew exactly what was going on and that we were happy with the car that we bought. He was personable, professional and plain fantastic to work with. The whole purchase process couldn't have gone smoother. We are incredibly happy with the car we bought, and with having had Daniel as our salesman. We will definitely return here once it's time to upgrade. ",5.0
13,"September 01, 2018",I can't say enough about my experience! I had been in a Total Loss and was very stressed about having to purchase a new vehicle. From the time I walked in to the time I left it was top notch! My salesman Daniel Kadar I can't even begin! He new exactly what to put me in and I love it! Josh in Finance was outstanding! I love my new Elantra and am so happy I purchased at Buddies McKinney!,5.0
14,"August 29, 2018",We purchased our Hyundai-Tucson from Paul Hayes and we could not be happier.  He made our experience very enjoyable.  He was able to match our new car with all our wishes.  We love our new car! ,5.0
15,"August 28, 2018","I purchased a new Hyundai Santa Fe. The dealership made the purchase extremely smooth. Being a senior adult,  my salesman Cameron spent a great deal of time explaining the cars computer system, even taking phone calls after hours. Over and beyond good customer service!",5.0
16,"August 18, 2018","My husband and I had searched several other Hyundai dealerships looking for a deal on an Ionic that no one would even come close to. Not only did Huffines deliver at $1000 less than what we were asking, but we had a great salesman, Daniel, who conducted a great deal of the transaction over the phone and internet so that by the time we arrived the car was already detailed and ready with a full tank of gas and we where out the door in less than an hour driving away with our new car! Thanks Huffines! ",5.0
17,"August 11, 2018",Just bought a Genesis G80 through Paul Hayes at Huffines Hyundai Kia McKinney.  Paul is customer focused and aims to please. Easiest buying experience I have had in all my years of buying and trading cars. See Paul and he can find what you are looking for.,5.0

19,"July 31, 2018","We bought a 2019 Santa Fe from Darren Bridges. He was a GREAT part of the deal; listened, searched, and worked out a great deal for us. No pressure and lots of experience made this the perfect car deal. Ask for Darren; you won't be disappointed!",5.0
20,"July 18, 2018","My salesman was Daniel Kadar, and overall my experience was very positive.  Daniel was very professional, and he listened to what I was looking for, including how I was on a time crunch.  In addition, the finance process was smooth.  I recommend this dealership for sure.",4.8
21,"July 03, 2018","The wife and I decided to go look at a Hyundai Tucson and just as expected, the minute we got out of the car someone was coming out to ""greet"" us.  Immediately I thought ""Here we go"", but to my surprise Cam Morrison just asked us if we needed assistance without giving us anything resembling a sales pitch.  We told him we were going to look around and he said ""cool, let me know if you have any questions and I will be inside if you need anything"" and he did just that.  I was kinda shocked because usually car salesman are stuck to you like a tick until you aggressively ask them to leave you alone, but this was different.  Once we decided to take a test drive, we went inside and asked for his assistance and he answered some of our questions regarding trim options so we could decide which one to take for a spin.  He pulled up a vehicle that had everything we wanted to see and off we went.  I thought for sure that this is where he will start to get under my skin, but he was very personable and relatable during the drive.  Having experience in sales, I understand the pressure that exist to ""make the sell"" and I didn't get any feeling that he was pressuring us to buy something today.  It is nice when you are talking to someone in this type of situation who you feel you have a genuine connection with and truly cares that your experience is above and beyond your expectations.  We asked a few more questions after the test drive and told him that we would be in touch once we were ready to move forward.  He thanked us for coming out and we left to go check out another dealership down the road.  To be completely honest, I never intended to even consider a Hyundai and went to the dealership because it was the closest to our house and the dealership that had the vehicle I truly thought I wanted.  We proceeded down the street and that experience wasn't bad, but I was shocked when I started to realize that I like the Tucson better than the car I thought I wanted.  It wasn't just features or warranty that made the difference, but the experience so far with Cam and Hyundai. My wife and I decided, a week later, that it was time to purchase.  I emailed Cam and told him what we were thinking.  He got everything prepared for our appointment and had the vehicle looking pristine.  He walked us through our financing/lease options, explaining the difference of each, and we made our decision.  He took us over to meet with JB and he also carefully made sure we understood all of our options and advised us on what might fit our needs without any pressure to up-sell us.  We got everything finished up and we left the dealership content and relieved that the experience went so smoothly.  I can't speak enough of how great the customer service is at this location.  From sales to financing, everyone involved was top notch and that goes beyond just those we spent most of the time with.  I felt a sense of family with the whole staff and that they truly are making the experience different.  You could see the pride they had in the service that they provide and I will be sure to recommend this dealership to everyone I know.  Thanks for the great work and proving my initial thought wrong in regards to how this might go.",5.0
22,"June 25, 2018","I bought my first Hyundai May 2017. When it was totaled one year later, I knew exactly where I would go to replace it and who my salesperson would be. I had the option of going with other brands or dealerships, but no one could beat, let alone match the service of David Harrison and Huffines Hyundai McKinney!",5.0
23,"June 19, 2018","I had called ahead to set an appointment to view an attractively priced pre-owned automobile.  When I arrived, Cameron Morrison met me with a smile and said he had both vehicles ready for viewing.  What he had done was find a new vehicle with identical features to the those of the pre-owned car in which we had expressed interest.  We ended up spending about $500 more and drove away with the new vehicle.  We were very pleased with Cameron's service-oriented attitude and his ability to anticipate what we might want even more than we had ourselves.",5.0
24,"June 13, 2018","Purchased a Stinger GT2 and worked with Anand Vallury as my salesperson and Ben Bazi, the General Sales Manager.  Worked with Joseph Bethel in finance.  Al were professional and great.  I actually like them!  I have purchased a lot of vehicles recently and I have to say that this place, and these people, are the cream of the crop.  NO ONE, and I mean no one, I have ever met in a dealership is more knowledgeable about not just his product, but all other competitive products, than Anand.  Not one single word of negative selling, just always pointing out how the vehicle I was looking at excelled over the others.  Not one single pressure sales tactic, not one misstatement, not one problem.  I never thought I would buy a Kia and never thought I would love a car dealership.  Huffines Kia proved me wrong on both accounts.  Definitely recommend them.",5.0
25,"June 09, 2018","We bought a brand new Santa Fe through Huffines and USAA after an accident totalled my wife's Jeep. Tony Asberry took care of our needs and made the buying experience quick and painless. Cain Maxwell in service did a great job making sure some upgrades we wanted were installed. It was an overall great expwrience.

27,"May 30, 2018","This is the third vehicle purchase with this dealership. I’ve been extremely satisfied with the customer service during each encounter.  During the last purchase, the sales representative, Keith, was extremely helpful and made the purchase extremely easy. And now the contract process is paperless!",4.8
28,"May 29, 2018","We came in on a lark a few weeks ago to look at the Santa Fe sport. Took a quick test drive with Daniel and were so impressed with the car and him, returned the next week to purchase the exact car we hoped to find.

29,"May 12, 2018","Recently purchased our 4th Hyundai, a Tucson, after passing down a Santa Fe to my daughter and Sonata to our son.  This was our second purchase from Huffines Hyundai McKinney. Dave Harrison made this the best experience yet. He is so knowledgeable and patient. Dave answered a lot of my questions via text which I really appreciated. His follow up after the sale was greatly appreciated too. I highly recommend Huffines Hyundai McKinney, especially Dave. ",5.0
30,"May 07, 2018","I leased a Kia Sorento April 12th and traded in a vehicle.  My family and I have purchased three cars from Jerry Blow and would highly recommend him as he teaches and helps with the decision making process.  
However the financing team is less than stellar. The new automated desktop which prompts for signatures was used to complete the financing paperwork.  I made the first month's payment and told I should receive a refund for my April 15th payment on the trade in.  Well several days later I was called for additional signatures so I made the 65 mile drive each way to sign more paperwork.  
Last week on May 2, I called the previous lender to follow up on my refund.  Almost 3 weeks later, the payoff had not been received from Huffines. I called and was told that the payoff would not be transmitted because there was MORE paperwork that needed signing.  Had I not called I wonder how long it would have taken for this to be addressed.
My next call was to Randy Knight the financing manager and left a voice mail.  Did I get a return phone call? NO!!! So last Saturday I drive another 65 miles each way to sign additional paperwork.  I spoke with the sales director Benjamin Bazi who assured me that he would get with Mr. Knight to effect resolution and call me today.  Did I receive a phone call today? NOPE The best he could offer me for my time and inconvenience was a third of a tank of gas.  
Now I may have confused myself with the customer but a part of tank of gas is no longer going to cut it.  I am now behind on a payment on a car I no longer own and have no idea when the previous lender is going to receive payment.  I need to hear from someone with the ability to answer these questions, make me whole and provide adequate consideration for my trouble.  Wonder when and who that'll be.....",2.0
31,"May 04, 2018",My car buying experience was a great one. Michael was very friendly and answered any question I had. They actually cared about working with me to get the car I wanted for the price I wanted. I would recommend this dealership to anyone looking to buy a new car.,5.0
32,"May 03, 2018","Best car shopping and purchasing experience ever!  Salesman Michael Lang did a great job explaining the cars' features in a fun and stress free way.  Sales Director Scott Feinstein was refreshingly up front about the pricing he could offer me.  I was shocked to be handed an unsolicited price summary on my first visit that included my ""out the door"" price.  (And yes, that was, in fact, the price I paid when I made my purchase a few days later!)  There were no gimmicks and no high-pressure sales tactics like those from Rusty, the sales manager at El Dorado Chevrolet.  I felt like Michael and Scott were trying to earn my business and went the extra mile to ensure I was satisfied with the deal as well as the experience.  I also took a test drive with Chris Tillman, who was equally helpful.  Clearly, this dealership has embraced a ""customer first"" philosophy.  They have earned my repeat business and will be recommended highly to friends and family.  I look forward to working with them again in the future!  Thanks guys!",5.0

34,"April 21, 2018","My 1st Hyundai I purchased was  from Tony Asberry. Never have I had such a good experience during the car buying process. It was smooth and easy. Tony took the time to get us what we wanted, and after the sale spent time going though all the features of the new car. Whenever my wife or I would bring the car in for service he knew who we were and always came over to say hi.

40,"April 02, 2018",I went to several other dealers while looking for the car I wanted.  Michael Lang found the exact car at another dealer in another state.  The guys @ Huffines made the effort to get me the car - a really big deal in customer service.  It was worth the drive to McKinney.,4.8
41,"March 30, 2018","This is my 8th vehicle that I purchased from the Huffines dealership family. This was my best experience (and I have had some very good ones previously). The key was exact car that I wanted wasn't available. They searched and  found the only one in the area & now it's in my garage. Keith Brown redefines the salesman. He is simply the best. He is sincerely interested in the customer and works to ensure that you are satisfied. He impressed me the first time he sold me a car and than surpassed himself with this second sale. I also want to give a shout-out to Scott Feinstein on the management side. There was some serious horse trading with the other dealership to get me the vehicle & Scott made it happen. Scott and Keith also negotiated an excellent deal with me for this sale. It seemed to be a win-win for all sides. You want a good car buying experience, I strongly recommend a visit to Keith Brown at the Huffines McKinney location. 
One final note: Service at this facility is excellent. This vehicle color was not available when I purchased my 7th car. Michael Bodensteiner in service advised me that there was one, where it was and set me on my adventure. That car wasn't available to me but Keith than found the only other in the area, Michael followed the process when it was located. I look forward to having him service my car as he is another one of the professionals at this dealership.  Many Thanks!",5.0

47,"February 25, 2018","Sean Kelly was absolutely fantastic. Followed up immediately on a Internet inquiry. Let us know of two vehicles we could see and drive and established a mutually agreeable time to visit the dealership. We met on a rainy morning and he had both cars in locations where we could see them without getting wet. I told him ""we are not going to buy today, this is a fact finding visit."" We took a test drive and Sean had our trade in valued. Long story made short, we bought a new Sorento. It was a perfect situation, car was right, price was right, salesman was right and the Dealership was right (4th car purchased from Huffines Kia). Sean was very knowledgeable about the car, the purchasing alternatives and, in general, handled himself professionally. All in all a great car buying experience.",5.0

He told us to check out the Hyundai's due to their reliability and warrantee. We stopped by Huffines Hyundai McKinney and that's where we met David Harrison. With David, there was never any pressure.  He was very patient with our buying process and extremely knowledgeable about cars, old and new. And finally, there wasn't a lot of back and forth before we arrived at an agreeable price.

I was interested in the 2018 Santa Fe Limited Ultimate AWD.  I was shocked at the vehicles features, ergonomics, build quality, and innovation.  In the test driving process I wavered on the AWD decision, but in the end, the ride quality in the AWD version was superior.  And I decided to go for the version with the Tech Package that adds Automatic Emergency Breaking. 

I also test drove the Sonata 2.0T and Hybrid.  The 2.0T is a rubber burning beast and fun to drive, but the Hybrid is a hands down winner as it is comfortable, has great design, gets 45 mpg, and has a lifetime warrantee on the battery.  Bottom line, if you are in the market for a 3 row SUV or 4 door sedan, you have to test drive these vehicles.  You will be shocked as was I.

Now back to David Harrison. Spend a little time with David and you will feel the love.  Yeah, he's there to sell cars.  And yeah, he loves what he does.  But there is just something special about the way he does it. He has truely made an enduring impact on my wife and I, and a great example of customer service done right.  And if you want the extra special treatment, tell him T.J. sent you.

I havent owned the Santa Fe long enough to need service.",5.0
52,"January 09, 2018","I could not ask for a better service experience. Chris, the Service Manager, set the appointment up and Greg, my Service Advisor, got the paperwork started. The appointment was to take care of a hatch rattle in my new Stinger. John, the dealership's Stinger-trained mechanic had previously identified the problem and had ordered the kit required in SA322. While I waited, I ordered some Stinger accessories from Charles in parts. The Parts Manager, Roy, was kind enough to share recently received information on oil requirements for my vehicle, which was different from other KIA products. Upon completion of the kit installation, John, who had just returned from his second Stinger training, road with me to verify that the hatch rattle was fixed....and it was fixed! I can't say enough about Huffines KIA of McKinney. The sales experience from the previous week was superb and the excellence I experienced there has been carried forward to their service department. I had the opportunity to speak with the General Manager, Dale Randolph, today when I went in to pick up the accessories I'd ordered. I wanted him to personally know what a great team he as assembled.",5.0
53,"January 08, 2018","I visited Huffines Kia looking for a used Kia Sorento after making an appointment with Becky Cunneen and was greeted and helped by Vincent Barber since Becky was busy closing a sale.
Vincent showed me a Kia Sorento SXL a car I had not been considering to buy but he showed me all the great features and quality built on that car and made me change my mind about what I wanted.
Once Beckybas available she took over and got me the car at a price that was what I was willing to pay and we finished the deal.
Both Becky and Vincent were a great help and I feel very happy with the service provided the price I paid and the quality of the car.
I would recommend the dealearship the sales and the car to anyone.

Levani Neidiradze was my sales consultant...he is what I call a ""Car Guy"" who knows his vehicles and his easygoing style allows the customer to feel comfortable through the process. I had questions about pricing and was able to deal directly with Ben Bazi, the KIA Sales Manager. Ben is the consummate professional...he acted as a facilitator of my purchase rather than as someone trying to sell me a car. As we talked, it became clear that Ben was a leader as well as a manager and as such has assembled an excellent team. Every single person I worked with was excellent...no weak links.

128,"October 03, 2017","I had the pleasure of purchasing a vehicle from Tony McCloud at Huffines Kia of McKinney. After being given quite possibly the worst customer service with a Volkswagen dealership that is not worth mentioning, I started the process with Tony to purchase a used Kia. My VW is still not drivable and needs a new transmission, a convenient 1,000 miles outside of power train warranty. Side note: VW's reliability was downgraded 8 spots by Consumer Reports. Tony drove from McKinney all the way to near downtown Dallas to pick me up in the car of my choice then over to Saginaw (FORT WORTH) to my parents house to close the deal. I dropped him back off in McKinney at about 10PM at night. He added a bumper to bumper warranty up to 100,000 at no additional charge and gave me 90 days of XM Radio. The process was more like old friends laughing and catching up than having to purchase a car. I was pleasantly surprised that there are people in the world with integrity, character, and genuine care for people. I really cannot sing his praises enough. Again thank you Tony for going above and beyond. Thank you Huffines Kia of McKinney for recognizing and employing salesmen that are a pleasure to work with.

130,"October 02, 2017","Out of all the dealerships (about 7+) in the DFW metroplex, this dealership was able to find the car I was looking for. I was on a 6 month search for the car of my exact specifications (2017 Kia Optima Hybrid EX in Gravity Blue with a Technology Package) and no other dealership would help me. 

I called Kia of McKinney and Mark Ladd was not only passionate about finding my car but it felt like he considered it one of his top priorities. He gave me updates about the status of the car (where it was, inspections completed, etc.). Once we got to the dealership, I met Ben Fernandez, Mark's manager and they were able to explain all of the processes to me with clear and concise detail.

I then met with the lovely Megan Lynch who was able to further educate me on financing options. Not only was she a wealth of knowledge, but she worked with me to get the best deal possible for my auto loan.

Overall, given the time frame I entered (7pm when they close at 9pm on a Saturday), I was able to drive away with a brand new car, knowing all the information needed while not feeling overloaded. They really have the process down and we got out of there in 2 1/2 hours. I know from experience buying a car can usually be a half-day to all-day process, but if you know exactly what you want and you have these people on the job, it will be the easiest car buying experience possible.",4.8

134,"September 27, 2017","I had the pleasure of purchasing my 2017 Tucson Limited from Chris Nelson at Huffines Hyundai McKinney.  It was without a doubt one of the BEST car buying experiences ever!   When my son and I visited Huffines McKinney on a busy Saturday afternoon several weeks prior, Chris greeted us immediately with an engaging smile and handshake and his undivided attention.    Although I immediately advised Chris that I would not be buying a car that day, he was professional, very knowledgeable and most importantly extremely patient with answering our questions  . . . and believe me, I had many!  During our test drive in the Tucson Night, Chris discussed all the new features available on the Night and shared the differences between the Night and Limited.  Afterwards we checked out the Limited and he pointed out the added safety features and equipment.   Between the five dealerships we visited that Saturday and several others I visited the last week in August, our visit with Chris was definitely the most impressive and the reason I contacted him when I was ready to buy.  Chris' initial offer was the most competitive and without the hassle of dreaded negotiations.  Both are major selling points for me and along with the organization and efficiency of closing the deal with Chris, I am definitely a very happy and satisfied customer.    Due to time restraints in my schedule on the purchase date there were a few items we did not cover.  However this should have absolutely no negative reflection on Chris.   Actually we discussed most of those details during my initial visit.  On the purchase date it was agreed, if or when I had additional questions, I would contact Chris or drop by for the ""full service"" overview.  I am confident that Chris will be available and more than happy to answer any questions I might have and to introduce me to the service department when the need arises.       I will gladly recommend Chris and Huffines Hyundai McKinney to my family and friends.   Well done Chris!!  Kaye Schaum",5.0

140,"September 15, 2017","This is my second Huffines new car.  The Huffines service department took excellent care of me with a warranty repair on the first car, so Huffines was my first stop when it was time to get another car.  As it turned out, my Huffines shopping experience went so well I didn't even visit any other dealerships this time.    I am very pleased with my sales person, Chris Nelson.  He treated me fairly and was very patient as I considered several different cars and changed my mind each time.  None of those were the Elantra Limited I ended up buying but somehow Chris figured out that this was the car I'd really be happy with, and he was right.  Chris wasn't ""selling"" me on a car, he was helping me to discover the right car for my needs.    I also considered several Kias at Huffines Kia (right next door).  I got the same fantastic attention and service there from Anand Vallury, but the Hyundai car was a better fit for my needs than the Kia models.  Either way, though, the Huffines family of dealerships really stands out.    Congratulations to both Chris Nelson and Anand Vallury for being several big steps above the average.",5.0

178,"July 29, 2017","I had a big problem with Huffines Hyundai Dealership in McKinney, TX. After buying my new 2017 Hyundai Accent at another dealer, I went to the Hyundai dealership at McKinney on 06/28/2017 for procuring a spare tire kit (Part number 1R40-AC900) as Hyundai does not provide one. The dealer charged me a total of $319.31 ($272.00 for the kit and tire, $20.00 for mounting the tire to the rim and $22.81 Tax). I was told that I would have to pay a charge of $20.00 for the mounting the tire to the rim of the spare kit. The purchase of the spare tire kit should include the mounting of the tire. Last year, I purchased a spare tire kit (invoice number 51189 dated 06/23/2016) at Fenton Hyundai at Mesquite, TX for my new 2016 Hyundai that I had purchased at another dealer . At that time the Fenton Hyundai charged me a total of $270.63 ($250.00 for the tire kit including tire and tax of $20.63). There was no charge for mounting of the tire on the rim. I still have the bill for that purchase. You will observe how much more that the dealer at McKinney charged me as compared the dealer at Mesquite. 
Even after paying $20 for mounting the tire, the service personnel would not balance the tire and put tire kit into the trunk of the car. ",1.2

We were able to come to terms in much less time than I anticipated.  Tony went out of his way to actually pick up the car I hoped to purchase.  My only comment that is not great, is that he did not show me the service side of the dealership.  I certainly thought about this before buying, but was so pleased with the purchase that I actually forgot to ask about service scheduling.  It was a relatively long day as Tony had to go to another location to pick up my car, while I toured old McKinney.  Overall, I was very satisfied and pleased. I will be servicing my new hybrid at the McKinney location, and look forward to having a professional and satisfying service experience.",4.8

I told myself I was not going to buy that night, but after driving off and then quickly thinking about it. I turned my car around made my purchase. When I came back, Carlos had just taken off, but Tony called him and assisted me until he came back. After that, everything was smooth.

257,"May 16, 2017","I came in to test drive a Sportage. I saw the NiroSUV, and after test driving it I knew that was the car I wanted! I love my car, and can't say enough about it or Taylor Blankenship. Thank you for making my experience great!
I have lower back problems, and have been looking for an automatic vehicle, as I have been driving a 5 speed manual truck and suv for the past 20+ years. My back has been getting worse, and I figured it was time to get an automatic. My main goals were finding something that would feel good to my back driving down the road, and good fuel mileage. I knew I wanted something small, but not too small. I didn't want to have to fall in, as I am 5'7"" tall, or tippy toe up in to it. Something that drives smooth, and is comfortable, good economically, roomy enough for when my grand babies come to visit, yet a bit sporty, with a good price tag.
I found all of this and more in my Niro! Did I say that I love my car? 😊😍 I was questionable about it being a hybrid, but Taylor answered all of my questions. I must say also, Taylor never once was trying to sell the Niro to me. It was all me. I knew that this was going to be my car! They even let me drive it home to let my husband check it out. That I must say was a plus. They did this because they were concerned about my back, and wanted to make sure that after driving it for a bit, more than a test drive, that it was gonna still be comfortable on my back. That was sooooo considerate of them. As a matter of fact, that is what sold me! My back felt better than it had in years while driving a vehicle! The Niro is a very comfortable vehicle. It rides and drives very, oh my gosh, very smooth! I can't even feel it shift, and usually just the slightest jerk of a shift, changing gears, will jar my back and cause some pain, but not the Niro. It is very roomy for me too, so when my other kids and grand babies come to visit there will be plenty of room for them. It has that not too sporty, but sporty look and feel. I live in the country, and there are some curvy roads. This vehicle handles them all great. It has nice, tight steering, and hugs the curves really well. Shall I say, it has some giddy-up & go! My 17 year old son enjoys driving it too! He loves the way it handles!
Oh, and the fuel mileage speaks for itself! I know it's a hybrid, and everyone drives differently, so it will basically depend on your driving habits. I have driven my Niro 327 miles and have only used 1/4 of a tank of fuel. I'm averaging 55.8+mpg at this time, but know that it will increase even more when I start my normal daily driving routine. My oldest son did some research, and informed me that the Niro holds the World Guiness record for the best mpg for a vehicle at 76.6 mpg. All I can say is WOW! I just bought myself a really GREAT car!

Anyone/everyone should at least go test drive the Niro just to see what I'm talking about! When you get ready to just ask for Taylor Blankenship. He is the best! He never tried to sell me on anything!!! The Niro sold itself to me. I know it sounds funny, and may be a bit strange, but it is very true. I absolutely love my Niro! Thank you, Taylor Blankenship, for helping me, and making sure that my back and myself were very satisfied with it before I bought it.

Huffines Kia in McKinney is a great place to go to get a vehicle. I will definitely come back, and definitely refer people to y'all!

Taylor, I just have to tell you one more time THANK YOU and I LOVE MY NIRO!🌺😍??

Taylor Blankenship I personally give you a 7 star******* rating for going above and beyond for me to make sure the Niro was going to be comfortable with my back problems! 

Very, very satisfied customer!

270,"May 06, 2017",I had purchased a 2014 Cadenza from Tony mcloud. It was late in the evening. Was not able to see the Hail Damage on the car. Our insurance company came out to look at the car as we added the car The day before. They advised us that the car had pre existing hail damage and if it hailed the insurance will only cover 70% of the damages. The next day took the car back and showed it to manager Kevin and was told to go ahead and make appointment with Tony to bring the car in so they will take care of it. Absolutely no problem . Tony didn't give me an appointment until Monday and that Sunday it hailed really bad in McKinney and the car was damaged a lot so insurance only gave us 70% of the claim.  Called Tony mcloud and he advised he will speak to Kevin and get back to me. So he called and left a voicemail stating no problem we will take care of it just bring us what the insurance paid and they will take care of the rest. Asked me to bring the car there drop it off along with the cash.  I dropped the car off along with cash. Hour later Kevin called and stated before you go get the rental to stop by so I did. When I got there he said his paintless guys can repair the car but it will not be very good job. So the car really needed to go to the body shop to get it done right. And he will talk to his body shop and take care of it. It's been over a month and I haven't heard anything back. I will get the car fixed and pay out of my pocket over $1500.  Which I shouldn't have to as Tony left a voicemail stating they will take care of it. But never did I am leaving this review because my experience stated with them really great but there words absolutely meant nothing. I still have that voicemail saved.  So my advice to everyone wanting to do business with these guys is do not buy a car from them in the dark. And if you do inspect it very well before you sign papers. Because as I came to find out there words are meaningless.   Take your money elsewhere and give it to a reputable dealer who will do what they said they would. ,1.0

278,"May 04, 2017","It all started when I went in to find out my lease end options for my 2014 Kia Optima - which I loved.  Tony McCloud listed to what I wanted and took me back to look at their newly designed  Cadenza.  They were nice cars, but then he found one ""I just have to sit in"".  I didn't tell him until the next day, that sit hooked me- not just on a Cadenza, but that car!  After I sat in my future car, Tony took me over to the new Kia dealership and introduced me to my salesman, Sean Kelly.  Sean was really helpful and I could tell he was trying to meet not just my needs, but my wants.  he worked with me to get payments where I want them and the package I wanted, but it wasn't that car- in fact I didn't know I want that car until that night when I slept on it.  The next morning I told Sean I want that car, and he made me a sweet deal.

We did some online research and found came across Huffines Kia McKinney, nothing but great reviews about customer service and how great they take care of their customers. I was skeptical but decided to give it a try. Originally, I communicated with Oneida Gonzalez via web chat through their website. She answered all my questions and was very informative. She encouraged me to go to the dealership to get the value of our Camaro. She told us she would not be there on the date we wanted to go but that they would have the information we spoke about on the system. SWEET! I show up and get greeted by Dan P, I shared with him our situation and let him know I was waiting on my fiancé to get there before we go any further. We went for coffee meanwhile. He was very pleasant and funny. After deciding what car we wanted, he and the manager went through ends meet to get us into the car we wanted! They assured us that they are working diligently to get us in our family car! AND WE DID! We got a Honda pilot and I LOVE IT! From the beginning to end, Dan was honest, informative, helpful, and very caring. You can tell this was not his first rodeo!

482,"July 08, 2016","I have been looking for a new car for about a month. For some reason I kept leaning towards Hyundai. When I was looking online at the Elantra, I saw that Chandler was available to answer any questions I had. So her and I emailed back and forth the whole day talking about the Elantra, she was very nice and extremely helpful. When I got to the dealership Monday June 27th, she was not there, but I was informed by the lady at the desk that Chris Haygood would be who I would be dealing with. I was not upset about this, but I was excited at the thought that I would be dealing with a woman vs a man when buying a car. Chris was very helpful and seemed to be pretty straightforward, but I still had my doubts about car salesmen. I pretty much knew from the start what I could afford, and really didn't want to get into a payment of over $300 a month. We barely got it under $300, then as soon as I went to finance, it shot back up over $300. At this point I was frustrated, but knew that this is what dealerships are all about. After telling the finance man Brian several times that I did NOT want any of the extended warranties, because I could only afford the payment, he finally offered me the lowest extended warranty for a small price. That was nice. But it makes you see how much these prices are jacked up! Something that could have been a few hundred a month, went down to $10 like that? That is concerning. After being done with finance, I am told by Chris that my car will be ready the NEXT day, June 28th, and that it will be tinted and detailed and ready for me by the time I get off of work. He calls me that night and informs me that it is not ready and will be the NEXT day. So I come to pick up my car June 29th, and the gas tank is not full and he doesn't have my 2nd car key. This was frustrating. Overall, I guess my first car buying experience went okay. I could have been more satisfied.",4.0

I would have my insurance adjust the vehicles & make all repairs, so that I didn't have to pay for insurance on two new vehicles as well as the hail damaged vehicles until they are repaired, extra money that I could have saved myself.  Also, I would drive my repaired sonata for 11 more month's, until the lease contract was up on it to save the 11 month's of money, that was rolled into the new vehicle, unknowingly.  My wife & I thought purchasing the new vehicle, waved the 11 month's left on the vehicle lease, & realized this 11 month's lease left on the contract was not waved, after the purchase of the vehicle was completed & reviewed what I should have paid, using 'truecar.com'.  After figuring out the actual payment of the vehicle, & calculating the lease month's left, the amount showed that  is where the extra money charged came from & that it hadn't been waved.  That is the only thing that was unclear to us, but after understanding that is where the extra money came from, & that we were within a $100 dollars of what we had been paying for two vehicles, we chose not to pursue it.

I used True Car to estimate the market value of the car, and True Car referred me to 3 dealers in the Oklahoma City area, however, none of them would honor the True Car estimated price because they didn't have the car that I wanted in stock. They did say that they could locate the vehicle for me, but it would cost me MSRP less available incentives.

I didn't want to pay MSRP because True Car's estimate was close to $6000 dollars lower than MSRP, so I expanded my search to Dallas and Houston areas. As soon as I sent my information through True Car, I was contacted by an Huffines Hyundai Internet Representative, who started delivering good news one text at a time. They had the car in stock. They would honor the True Car Estimate, which was the lowest price that I could find, and best of all, they would deliver the vehicle to my front door! Financing application was painless to fill out, and they offered me an interest rate better than USAA. Within 24 hours of contacting me, Huffines Hyundai were on their way to my house to deliver the vehicle, and I received it yesterday in pristine condition.

Sales force there I feel are picking and choosing their customers. I didn't like being switched to a different salesman after talking and testing driving with someone.  
I wound up not getting the Hyundai I truly wanted.
I have a scratch on my lower driver's side door and rim that I don't know if it was because the car was a demo or the car wash but its it there and now I'm more depressed after only 1 1/2 weeks owned this car.

I understand the numbers to balance the trade and discounts but I wasn't not given a choice to get a different color and I hated being told I was being petty because I wanted a white Sonata with black leather with orange stitching to be happier with accepting a Sonata over a Santa Fe.

I was at this dealership last Friday just to complete all the paperwork and after a couple of docs left to sign in front of their Finance Manager, I realized that I was facing one of famous auto fraud that is the practice of quoting a lower price that the number that is ultimately included in the contract. So I caught that the contract price on the contract was different from price quoted to me.

I appealed to a finance manager and he brought him to me. Of course, he started lying that we discussed and agreed that price. I never expected him to admit and did not want to waste any of my time at all so just walked out of the deal.

I just feel sorry for whoever runs this dealership who has to deal with him kind of person everyday.

664,"December 24, 2014","We highly recommend Huffines Kia.  Our experience there was unlike anywhere else we shopped. Sean and John went above and beyond in their helpfulness.  Rather than try to sell us the car they wanted to sell (like every Dodge dealer we visited), they listened to what we wanted, searched the inventory around the region and found the perfect car for us and had it transferred to their lot so we could see it.  Then, they didn’t play the negotiating games the other dealerships were making us play.  Instead, they were transparent on pricing and made us the best deal right from the start.  Sean, John and Huffines Kia made the car buying experience a great one and we look forward to many years of enjoying our new Sedona!

He was more than understanding of our time commitments that day and made it clear that he would do everything in his power to expedite the process. Hands down one of the most endearing and professional salesman I have ever met. The overall experience was seamless and I couldn't have been happier with the car he helped us pick out, a 2015 Elantra.

On a whim, before heading to Cadillac to close the deal on a new loaded XTS, I wanted to look at the Genesis.  I walked in the showroom and saw an Equus which i thought was stunning.  The salesman greeted me and my wife with a sincere smile and handshake (at this point, I knew it was not going to be a high pressure pitch). Daniel Kadar was the mans name.  We talked at length and then went on a test drive.  This is the first car salesman EVER that listened to what I wanted and didn't try to over talk me.  It was a very comforting feeling.  He stayed with us for about 2 hours and answered every question.  We truly felt like this was going to be a great relationship and car, so we bought it.  Daniel stayed with us every step of the way up to and including taking us to meet Isaiah (finance mgr). 48 hours later, our new car was ready (it was brought in from another dealership).  We picked it up this morning, and Daniel was there with us and re-explained every gadget on this beautiful car. I believe Daniel and I will keep in touch for years to come.

I went there late on Monday evening and left with a new car and a Kia customer for life. Tom was so wonderful very knowledgeable about the company owner and President and most important the cars. He stayed past closing  over a hour to be exact. Since was late he promised to have car detailed and fill car up with gas if bought car in next day. I arrived next day he had car detailed and while that was happening he went over every feature of my car every page of the Manual, a hour and half later I was thrilled to pull out of dealership knowing how to use voice command (which he setup and connected my Mobile Phone), windshield wipers, etc etc. I can not say enough nice things about my experience with Tom Eppler and the Kia team he took me around to meet everyone, service manager, parts people. I cannot tell you in a paragraph how impressed I am with Mr Eppler truly a wonderful salesman and guy.

We visited several dealers and ended up buying from Huffines in McKinney, tx.  The accident and the subsequent shopping was a nightmare and we had a horrible experience with another dealer.  Huffines, Alan Dormer, and Rico Torres was a Godsend.  They stayed with us way past their normal working hours and showed so much compassion and caring to my daughter.  I am still amazed at how much time and effort they put out to make her happy.  I will NEVER visit another dealer for a car new or used.

686,"April 22, 2014","I was recently in a car accident and was in search of a car equivalent to the one I had.  I came in last week dreading the whole car shopping experience and hating the fact that I had to get a new car.  Alan, along with Rico, stayed 3 hours late on the day that I decided on a car to get everything ironed out before the end of the night.  Because of another incident, not having to do with Huffines McKinney, I was unable to get the car I was seeking, but had to have transportation, so I decided on a car and started the process.  About 9 p.m. we were sent home and told to come back Friday to complete the remaining paperwork, based on the fact that the banks were closed.  When we came in Friday we were greeted with smiles from everyone we talked to.  We waited in Alan's office for what seemed to be a little longer than it should be to just wrap up some paperwork.  After a while, Alan came in and told me to come with him to the parking lot.  I immediately thought something else had gone wrong, but he walked me over to a 2011 Elantra and unlocked it.  He explained to me that this was a better deal than the previous car I had gone home with the day before, and that he knew I wasn't too excited about the other one, so he had been working behind the scenes to get me a car I liked a lot better.  I was thrilled with the car he had gotten for me.  This kind of service exceeds any other service I have ever been given, whether it was a dealership or any other business.   I have bought a car from Huffines McKinney before, and this example is what will keep myself and anyone else I know that needs a car coming back!  The fact that Alan, along with the staff cares about what the customers want, not just about selling cars, is above and beyond any other dealership I have had an experience with.  I just want to commend Huffines McKinney, especially Alan Domer, for the fact that this horrible experience was made into an enjoyable one simply by the service received at Huffines McKinney.  As I previously mentioned, I will not shop anywhere else for a car in the future, as well as any of my friends and relatives!  Thank you so much!

687,"April 09, 2014","I recently took my wife's 2010 Hyundai Genesis 3.8 Coupe in for a routine oil change.  Most car dealers today complete a Multi Point Inspection Sheet (MPI)when they perform routine services such as oil changes.  The Multi-point inspection sheet tells you information such as brake thickness measurements, tire tread thickness, battery terminals, filters, etc.  These are part of what is called they ""vital signs"" diagnosis of service.  This MPI sheet has three colors to identify the current state of these components and whether they need to be addressed while you are there.The status is defined by it being GREEN (good), YELLOW (will need service/replaced soon) and RED (replace now/requires attention now).

When the service was completed, I paid, got the car and went home.  I went to dry off the wet car (they wash it but don't dry it-poor job) and lifted the hood to wipe down the inside areas.  I noticed the battery had ""corrossion"" on it and you could tell this needed attention.  I looked at the Multi-point inspection (MPI Sheet) and the technician marked the boxes that the battery was good and it did not have any corossion!  The person who supposedly worked on our car DID NOT DO WHAT HE SAID HE DID.  I drove the car back to the dealership and I finally had to deal with ""Ryan"" the service manager who smugly told me that maybe I needed a new battery.  He acted like it wasn't a big deal.  He did have the battery terminals cleaned up but was not really apologetic about it-again, the SMUG attitude.  My advice is to not go to this dealership, they are not professional and really do not care.  In addition, I really wonder how many customers pay for services that HUFFINES does not perform.  I will not be back to this store and can only say, BUYER BEWARE!!!!!",2.2

692,"February 28, 2014","My husband myself and my son drove 3hrs from Oklahoma to Sw kia to buy a vehicle from a salesman that we had been talking to for months. We knew what we wanted and knew what we could afford and all of this was promised to us from the salesman at SW Kia. We got there and wasted 4 hours of our time and seen only 4 vehicles, that were not even remotely close to what we wanted or had discussed with the salesman. So we ended up leaving! We were disappointed, angry and very discouraged about the whole entire vehicle shopping/buying experience/process. As we were driving back to Oklahoma, I remembered that I had seen the Kia dealership in McKinney, I asked my husband if we could just try one more dealership and if we didn't get what we wanted than we could just leave, after all we were shopping, had $7000 cash and this was supposed to be my valentines present! So I called and spoke with Fred Jones, who was very kind and his concern for us to get a vehicle was such a relief, he told us to come and see him he would be waiting for us. From the moment we pulled up I knew that this man was going to make my very special day end beautifully! We were treated like family, Fred was able to calm me and my husband down, make my son feel at home with tv, hot cocoa, and even games on Fred's tablet. We told Fred what we wanted, what our budget was, what our concerns were, since we had been shopping for months! He very patiently listened to us and gave us the pros and cons and showed us vehicles almost immediately! And the vehicles were what we were looking for to a T! We found the one we wanted and went in and started the process. Oh boy what a relief!! And then we were introduced to John(who I referred to as the banker from ""Deal or no Deal"")and he was just as amazing as Mr. Fred(which my son called him)! those two kept us laughing and were just a joy to be around! They made us really forget our stress and even forget we were making such a large purchase! They really were amazing to us!!!!!!!! And then we met ""Pretty John"", and he was just as cute as a button with his suit and tie and adorable smile, and we got all of our financial paperwork signed and were on our way home with our BRAND NEW KIA SORRENTO!!! The whole experience was amazing and very fast(1.5hrs)! I know that had it not been for how fantastic Mr. Fred was from the get go, we would not have purchased the vehicle, and then ""The Banker"" John and ""pretty"" John were also a bonus.

He was very friendly, professional, personable, and made our car buying experience easy! I’ve always loathed the car buying process due to haggling and the back and forth routine and the mystery man in the back of the room. The initial price given to us from Huffines came in well below the price I was expecting to pay and have to fight for. Daniel and the staff at Huffines Hyundai all deserve an A+!  ",5.0
709,"November 18, 2013","John Bernius in sales helped us with our trade in on our Kia Sedona to a Sedona EX.  He located a great car for us, secured a good trade-in value to take the place of a downpayment, checked our credit and got us a 1.9% loan and kept our new payments in line with the old.  He did all the legwork via e-mail for us, which was a huge help.  It meant far less time in the store finalizing the purchase.

This was our fifth car purchased through Huffines Kia/Hyundai in McKinney.  We use them for service on all the vehicles as well, and we have always been pleased with the timeliness and quality of the work on the cars.  They have been great to work with over the years.

712,"October 31, 2013","I had made an appointment with Steven Robertson on a rainy Saturday.  To my surprise, he greets and meets me with a hot cup of coffee.  He was so friendly and informative.  I have never had such a wonderful experience with a very, honest, non-pressuring salesperson. We test drove 2 beautiful cars.  At that time, Steven, explained all items that come with the car and was extremely knowledgeable about each car.  The one thing I noticed about Steven was his honesty.  He was very thoughtful and wanted to make sure I knew everything about the vehicle and the deal and was very satsified. The whole team of employees at this dealership were friendly and very helpful.  They seem to enjoy their jobs and always had smiles on their faces.  

I would highly recommend this dealership and Steven to anyone.  I have never had such a wonderful experience at a car dealership as I had at Huffines.  In fact I had visited 2 other dealerships that day and was not treated as special as I was at Huffines.  Thank you for training your people to know exactly what customers need to feel satisfied when entering such an expensive purchase.

713,"September 30, 2013","Last month I was rear-ended hard enough to push me into the car in front of me while I was waiting at a stop light. After seeing my beloved Jeep Commander get towed away, I was even more heartbroken when the call came saying it was totaled. When I shop for a car, there is months of research involved and a desire to want a certain type of car. With little notice, I had to buy a car and the only thing I knew that I wanted was that it not to be a van and not a brand new car. Doesn't really rule too much out (*sigh). Going after a recommendation, my husband and I made an appointment with Kevin Cheatham at the Hyundai dealership in McKinney. It had been 3 weeks since the accident and I was tired of being in rental cars. Saturday evening, we joined Kevin on the lot and while the men talked specs, I wondered around hoping something would jump out and say 'buy me'. Much to my shigrin, cars don't do that. Nearly in tears of frustration, the Hubby asks if I see anything that I could possibly like. On the used car lots, there were 2 that could have possibly fit into my 'I will maybe think about them' category. The Acadia was locked and the Murano was unlocked, so I sat in the Murano. After taking it for a test drive with the Hubby and Kevin, I was impressed. 

Backstory: I did lots of research in the prior weeks while driving the rental of what I needed, wanted, and did not want in a vehicle. I came to the dealership armed and ready with a full page checklist: needs first, then wants. 

After the test drive, the guys talked features while I attacked my list. Working my way down, not only did it have everything on my needs AND wants, but it gave me things I didn't even dare put on the list (ie. sunroof). We told Kevin we wanted to think and pray on it and agreed to come back Monday night. 

Monday night we sat down and got to see the nitty-gritty on car-fax, numbers, etc. Interesting thing I noted: the car was bought, checked out, and ready to be sold on 8.29.13. My accident was 8.29.13. Coincidence? I think not. After spending time with Kevin & Rico (who was wonderful as well), we joined Isaiah in the finance office and signed the pens dry. 

Today, I am enjoying my 2009 Nissan Murano with greatest of pleasure and would recommended this dealership, Kevin Cheatham, Rico Torres, and Isaiah anytime you are in the market to buy a car. Their friendly demeanor and genuine hospitality can really make a person feel special. ",5.0

It worked that day only, by Sunday it did not work so bright and early Monday morning(June 17,2013) I went back.  The door was locked, Justin had to unlock the door and let me in(business hours start at 7 AM so I do not know why it was locked.  There were two people in the waiting room, a male and a female.   Junebugs were racing around like they owned the place.   I waited about 10-15 minutes, then the tech brought me outside to my vehicle and tried to tell me the a/c works, I went through all the dial options for the air and he kept claiming they work when they clearly didn't.  Then Justin got into the vehicle and checked and claimed they worked.   There is no air coming from the lower vent with the feet area.  When the max a/c is on it does not blow as much air as it is supposed to, it blows the same amount as when it is on the regular dial.   The back vent does not work, same problem as when I brought it in.  The air does not work at the feet area.  It does not work correctly when on MAX A/C.  It takes it a good minute to even start blowing air through.   I was charged 464.42 for these repairs and it only worked one day.  They did nothing to fix my vehicle or refund any money.   They also did not replace the air filter or cabin air filter when I said I wanted everything having to do with the A/C fixed! It was not fixed, It does not work correctly.

719,"March 13, 2013","My experience buying a used car here included all of the terrible used car dealer stereotypes you hope you never have to encounter. All of the people we worked with, from the salesman to the finance people, were dishonest and manipulative. For example, we were told, ""I'm really doing all I can to get down to the price you need. I've been giving on my end, so I'll need you to give on your end too"", and really, all they were doing was extending the monthly terms of the loan while keeping the total purchase price the same. Our experience with the finance people was just as infuriating. I would strongly recommend looking over each and every line of every document (although, I don't recommend buying a car here at all!), because we found that extra costs would be added into our overall purchase price even after we told the man explicitly that we did not want those services. He repeatedly tried to argue that we should add these warranties because they don't increase our monthly payment amount; that was true, but again, our loan terms were extended, interest rate was the same, and our overall purchase price was higher. This is simple math, but my guess is that they get away with these tricks over and over. ",1.0

721,"January 29, 2013","I was in on Friday evening looking at a Kia Forte Koup. I met with a salesman named Tom. I really had my heart set on the Forte Koup. I told Tom I was looking to keep my payments in the ballpark of $300 with a little budge room. I told him up front that I have a medium credit score but that I have a cosigner with great credit and anticipate no issues being approved. I had a trade in that according to auto trader and kelly blue book was worth 4500-5000. We test drove the car and were very pleased with it. During the drive Tom was very informative and gave great information. However, once back to the dealership to talk numbers I was VERY offended. He came back from talking to ""the boss"" and all he said was sorry can't do it, not with your credit and your monthly payment. He neglected to even talk about the fact that I had an excellent cosigner with great income and great score. I myself also make good income even considering the bad credit which was brought upon me by a family member. He told me that unless I came back with a ""couple grand"" that he could not help me. Well, I would like to say that that was unfortunate for him, because the VERY next Kia dealership that I went to (the very next day) put me in the car that I chose that was listed for almost 24,000 and worked numbers with me until I got it where I wanted and gave me more for my trade than I even asked for. I had to put NO money down and was approved with a 5.9% finance rate. I would like you to know how very dissatisfied I am and was with Tom's service and how I was treated, as if he was too good for me. He acted as if he had never met anyone with such bad credit. His loss is my gain. My first choice was Huffines because a friend of mine just bought a car there. However, I have told her of my experience and she will be joining me at my Kia dealership for maintenance. Disappointing.

 I called the main number for the dealership at 4PM asked for New Car Sales and Steve Robertson picked up the phone. Right away I could tell this was not a typical sales guy. There was no ""i'm gonna take care of you..."" scripted text. He just very sounded down to earth and very straight forward. The guy is a patient listener and forgiving negotiator.

 Super low pressure sale, not at all stressful. Did the whole deal in a couple of hours. I've never bought a car like that before. Steve is a great guy to deal with. I promise if you buy a car from him, you will be writing one of these afterwards.

723,"September 04, 2012","Stay away from this place. Shady business practices...

I live 35 miles from McKinney and own a Kia vehicle that is a few years old. A few days back I received a postal mail that was offering a trade-in offer on the latest model. The mail indicated manufacturer warranty of $7500 and dealer ship discount of $975. Wary of the gimmicks, I called up the dealership to confirm and the guy who picked the call- Rudy, acted as if he was on top of it and can work it out after looking into the car (I was also upfront that my car had hail damage). 

Just an hour later after reaching the dealership, i was shocked to see that he did not have any clue of the offer letters that were sent. He had to go check with the manager and when he came back, he told us that it was a mistake and they could only provide close to half of the discounts that were indicated in the mail letter!! He even made a photocopy of my mail letter!!  Why make somebody drive 70 miles and waste everybody s time?  Obviously the fine print had a clause about  We reserve the right to modify this quote to correct arithmetic errors , that is the whole reason i called to check and why misguide?

728,"May 19, 2012","APPROVED BY FORD NOT BY KIA ??? within minutes of visiting two dealership. I had been adoring the 2012 Ford Fusion from afar for the past 2 years, until I looked at an Kia Optima and fell in love. Being upside down in my 2 yr. old 2010 Charger, unworthy credit score and no money down, I began to think I would never get out of a car that I never enjoyed. I told the salesman there at Huffines that I was already approved by a Ford dealership in Greenville for a 2012 Fusion, so I figured that it would not be a problem in getting financed for an Optima which was priced less than the Fusion. After being at Huffines for an hour I left after being told because of my credit score I needed $5000 down to get payments close to $600 to $700 a month with Kia trade-in appraisal of 14,500 on my 2010 Charger. Being on disability and retired, I would never pay that for an Optima, my payments on the Charger was $475, previously purchase at Dodge City in Mckinney. I drove straight to Ford dealership in Greenville that emailed me an approval financially with the $475 monthly payments I needed before I ever stepped on either lot. Ford appraisal of 17,000 plus 2000 in rebates, interest rate of 3.9% financed thru Ford Motor Credit allowed me to afford a new 2012 Ford Fusion in less than 2 hours of leaving Huffines Kia in McKinney. I will never understand the difference, but maybe if Kia would have work harder in financing they would have had another happy customer. I will say Ashley and Rudy were nice.

The Huffines McKinney location had a car I was interested in and I decided to just ""pop-in"" and check it out.  It was close to closing so I assumed I would either get blown off or dealt with quickly so they could shut down.  Boy was I wrong - it didn't take long to be greeted by Steve Robertson in the parking lot and he could't have been nicer or more patient.  This is my first Kia so I had a lot of questions about the car and the company.  Steve answered them all and then offered a test drive knowing I was just ""looking.""  At no point in our encounter did I get any classic slick ""car guy"" lines and Steve made it feel very personable.  I told him exactly what I wanted, how I like to purchase, and what would make or break the deal.  Steve went down my list one by one, we addressed each issue and 24hrs later we had a new car.  The negotiations were very much a negotiation and at no point did it feel one sided.  And to Huffines credit I never once got the entourage of Sales Managers coming through the office.  I met with Steve and dealt with Steve to the final handshake.  I appreciated the no-hassle approach and for also being treated like an educated buyer.  Thanks again Steve - you will definitely be recommended! 

I would also like to thank the Huffines McKinney Kia dealership as well.  We had to go back up a few times just to sum up some paperwork and take care of a little tweak to the car.

731,"February 11, 2012","I've bought and sold many cars from many dealers.  This is the first time I had such a bad experience from a dealer/salesman.

Reason No: 1:  I returned the next day to report that the vehicles door are not locking when driving.  Since I have kids, it's a safety issue.  They don't want to fix the issue.  When I told the sales man what if someone falls out while driving since the doors are not locked, he said we can't do anything when people want to suicide.  After talking to him and the manager for several minutes to address the seriousness of the issue, they stood by their decision and told me to take it to the manufactures dealership to fix the issue.  Sales man called me to come outside and talk, and as soon as I got outside away from the other customers, he started raising his voice and started talking nasty in front of my kids!  2 years old and 10 year old!  Didn't want to make a scene in front of my kids so, I left.  Made a complaint to the manager and he said he'll talk to him about it.  I'm pretty sure he didn't.  Issue with the car is still not fixed.

Reason No: 2:  They offered free Tomtom portable navigation that's worth $150.00 with the purchase of the vehicle.  I forgot to asked them by the time I left since I spent several hours their for the process and the kids were tired and crying.  I called the next day for the free navigation, and the salesman acted like he don't know anything about it.  I printed out the ad and faxed it over and after several phone calls, he finally agreed to give me the GPS the next day.  When I picked up, the box was so beat up and old and everything was open in the box.  He said the service department opens the package to verify if the navigation is working prior to issue the customer.  (Yeah right!).  I got home and discovered it was a used navigation and the windshield mount had a hole in it like someone had it screwed in to the dashboard or something.  I called him again and he said he'll give me another one.  He says that's gonna be an open one too!  Why advertise if they have no intention of giving good products to customer?  By the way, when I checked the price of the GPS, it's not even worth $80.00 and the once they are giving to customers are probably returned product from major retailers!

The part that i normally would have dreaded, credit, payment, yada yada, that was a breeze! we got through it, Varnado was very helpful in dealing with the bank and getting me approved. Not 100% content with the interest rate, but i'll be refinancing with my credit union before long. 
I would recommend this dealership to everyone looking for a car without the headache and drama that comes with any other dealership!",5.0
748,"April 12, 2011","My husband and I research many cars for weeks. We attended the Dallas car show and narrowed down our choice to the Kia Sorento. We spoke with a few dealerships that weren't even aware of some of the features or discounts available.
 That wasn't the case with Keith at Huffines Kia Mckinney. He made everything easy. We were undecided about some options so he had different cars ready for us to test drive, but after a casual and friendly conversation he said he knew the car we would like and he was correct. The price was fair, with great discounts. Keith Grubb is by far the best car salesman we have ever worked with.

We left that day with the car Keith recommended, there were no surprises, just great people making every process easy for us to have the best service possible. We highly recommend this dealership.",5.0
749,"April 07, 2011","From the moment we walked through the doors, the staff was courteous and helpful. There was absolutely no pressure from anyone to buy a car, and they went to great lengths to make sure we were satisfied. Rico even worked to see that the front tires on the car we bought were replaced with new ones. I hope both of these sales people are available when my children begin looking for a car to purchase. This will be the very first place we'll go and hopefully, the only place if they have what we're looking to buy! I don't think any other dealership or salesmen will approach their attitude and price. 
Smiles and thanks,

750,"April 03, 2011","Working with Huffines Hyundai McKinney was a wonderful experience.  Everything from the initial greeting through picking up my brand new Santa Fe was handled expertly.  Mr. Fahmy, the sales manager, and Mr. Houston, my salesperson were very professional and at the same time approachable and friendly.  I don't think you could do better at any other dealership.  I spend 2 and a half weeks going from dealer to dealer looking at and test driving numerous cars, but I didn't encounter any other dealership or sales experience better than at Huffines Hyundai McKinney.  Do yourself a favor and drive out there.  You won't regret it.  Ask for Trevor.  He is a pleasure to do business with.",5.0
751,"March 23, 2011","I had originally been working with another dealer who repeatedly tried to talk me out of the exact car I wanted because they did not have it on their lot and told me no dealer in Texas had it and they couldn't find one elsewhere either.  I randomly called Huffines and got Tayler on the phone, asked him if he had a car with the specifications I wanted and right away he said he had two on his lot.  Before I made my way out there he went and physcially checked to make sure and called me back within 10 min.  I went in that night and bought the car.  All of the employees were extremely polite and finished the transaction even though it was after closing.  I appreciated their honestly and dedication as well as working with me to get the deal done.  I was very impressed with this dealer and will go back.  ",5.0
752,"February 23, 2011","Hello, I would rate my experience as Excellent during my recent purchase of a 2011 Sonata.
The knowledgable sales staff really helped make my decision very simple. The questions I had and the readily available information from them truly made my decision a no brainer.
I love the my new Sonata. The sales staff at Huffines in Mckinney is top notch and the finance man knows his job well.
The extra time taken by the sales staff to help me understand the controls thoroughly and introduce me to the service dept after the sale, just goes to show, you have very valuable employees that truly care for the customer.
I will recommend Huffines to anyone thinking of a new vehicle.

Thank you!

753,"February 20, 2011","Great place to find inexpensive used cars,  Great selection and found something in my budget.  The salesperson (Brian) was great and got me into my new car quickly and didn't waste my time. Everyone I treated me with respect and I will recommend this dealership to everyone!",5.0
754,"December 16, 2010","Best dealership experience I have aver had.  From the test drives of the Sorento's, to them finding the exact vehicle I wanted and having everything all set before I even got there. Once i arrived paperwork took about 1 hour.  Also got a great price to boot, paying about 93% of MSRP (anything 95% and down is considered a decent deal).  I will be going back soon to purchase again, my wife is almost ready for a new car.

755,"September 01, 2009","Mason was absolutely superb, even though he is not yet a seasoned professional.  What talent.

When I responded to the JDPowers survey, I didn't rate Huffines Kia as a 10 because there is always room for improvement.  

It was August in Texas and the last weekend for Cash for Clunkers.  The overall process took more than 7 hours, mostly because the dealership was so very busy.  Mason had 3 customers at one time in various stages of buy cars.

The experience could have been better if (1) cold drinks or water was provided free of charge, (2) others could have been brought in to speed up the processing of the paperwork and prep of the vehicle, and (3) snacks, popcorn, or cookies free, because we ran out of cash on hand quickly from buying drinks.

None of this is a reflection on Mason, it is solely improvements that the dealership could contemplate in the future.

Of course, all of those suggestions are in the EXCEEDING EXPECTATIONS category, above what other dealerships provide.

Thank you for the good experience.  We will be back for our next car.
