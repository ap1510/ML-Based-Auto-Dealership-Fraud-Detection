Plus, we feel he did his best in getting us a good deal for the car. But, most surprising: Rob was waiting for us when we finished signing paperwork! Wow! Who does that? After a long day at work, everyone just wants to go home. Very impressive! Great job, Mr. Robert Hill!!

Sincerely,

17,"April 01, 2018","I found a low-mileage Escalade online at Alderson, but it had no photos.  I inquired about the vehicle through their website and was called by Niki Martinez from the Used Car Sales Center.  Niki was very kind, very professional and above all, very accommodating.  She invited me down to see the vehicle, which was presently in the detail shop.  She went and picked it up and had it waiting at the door.  I had our trade-in evaluated, and decided to bring our other vehicle in to have it evaluated to see which worked best in our purchase the next day.  Long story-short, my wife and I drove away with TWO low mileage used vehicles, the Escalade and a GMC Yukon.  We are very appreciative for the quality service and professional manner we were treated.  Every salesperson greeted us and engaged us through the process.  The sales manager, Steve, stopped in often to see if we had any questions, and explained choices we had in financing.  We drove several vehicles and we were allowed consideration as we chose our vehicles.  We didn't feel rushed.  The Lexus manager, Ryan Jama, greeted us happily as we looked at new vehicle opportunities.  Best of all, Niki was so appreciative as we announced we wanted both of the finalist choices.  Niki is a breath of fresh air to my wife and me.  She has a promising future at Alderson, and we now have a new home for future auto purchases.  Both cars were topped off with fuel and freshly washed for delivery.  I never thought I could afford to shop at Lubbock's finest high-end dealership.  Now, I know that was a misconception.  We are so excited to be a part of the Alderson Family....and, we look forward to sharing our experience with friends and family.  Oh, and the best part, after we worked the deals on the trades, and they ran our credit, our payments came back lower than we had agreed on both vehicles due to Steve finding us the BEST deal on financing.....THAT has never happened at other dealerships.
