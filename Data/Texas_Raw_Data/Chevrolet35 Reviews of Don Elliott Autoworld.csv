0,"October 18, 2019","My wife and I pulled out of a restaurant and the check engine light came on. We chugged around a corner and pulled into Don Elliott Dealership in Wharton, Tx. Talked to Chris at the service desk and told her we had to be at a 50 year class reunion , an hour away, that started at 5 pm. She was able to have the check engine light read and the mechanic said he could repair it immediately. We were on our way in 2 hours. Chris and staff saved our day and weekend. Many thanks to Chris and David

1,"April 12, 2018",Bought a used vehicle here. Has been in the shop 3 times in the 3 weeks that we have had it. The guy above all the salesman is so rude and made every experience feel like it was our fault and talked down to us. He got called out on his crooked lies at the end of it. We will NEVER do business with them again. I feel sorry for anyone that has to deal with the guy. One guy ruined it all. Oh and the rental they set us up for? Closes before we can even get there. ,2.0
2,"June 22, 2017",This place offered me the best service at a car dealership that I've ever received in my life. Ask for Chris or Teresa because they go above and beyond to help their customers.,5.0

4,"May 06, 2017",We had the pleasure of purchasing our vehicle at Don Elliott Autoworld.  Johnny Garcia was our salesman.  He was open and honest about the vehicle pricing and how it compared to other vehicles for sale at other dealerships.  He was patient with us and made sure our needs were met.  We also interacted with Crystal who was equally helpful.  Our appointment was setup by Ashley and she made sure our questions were answered before making the 1.5 hour trip to the dealership.  Great Staff!!,5.0
5,"January 23, 2017","Our 2013 Dodge Ram 1500 needed the air suspension compressor assembly replaced and the factory part was back ordered for WEEKS! However, the employees in the parts department went above and beyond in locating the items and had my husband back in his truck in just a couple of days! ",5.0

7,"April 29, 2015","Went to this dealership to try to get into a used car. I'm on disability and needed a reliable but affordable car. Johnny Garcia immediately said that he had the car for me. I saw the car he suggested and thought I would try it out . He said the he would have to install a GPS on it that I had to sign for. BIG mistake!  I gave a a $1300.00 down pymt. Took the car home just to have the worst experience of my life with a car. It had 
so many major problems with it. Took it back 2 days later and he refused to return the full amt of my down pymt. He kept $400 and said it was for the GPS.  Now needless to say, I have to save up more money for a down pymt another car. I'm sure that whom ever he trys to sell that junk to next will be charged foe the GPS that I payed for. I'm so upset of the way Don Elliott does business. You don't take advantage of people just because they are women.

9,"March 27, 2014",I had an appointment to look at new cars and was met at the door by Susan Wells. She was very helpful in knowing which vehicle to show me. Andy Hollingsworth worked hard to get me a good interest rate. Bill Davis got all the paperwork done and helped pick out which extra warranty was good for me. Johnny Garcia helped me all along the way to decide on certain issues I needed help with. They were all a great team and I feel like I made 4 new friends. I even got to meet Mr. Elliot himself. Great dealership! ,5.0
10,"March 24, 2014","I had been without a vehicle for a few years, and it had become critical for me purchase something affordable and reliable in order to transport myself around Houston. Without hesitation, I came to my hometown of Wharton, and put my full trust in Jason Rivera, a fellow Wharton native. He had sold me another vehicle in the past, and I found him to be a man of integrity and  a skilled salesman with excellent product knowledge, He was able to find the perfect vehicle to match every requirement that I suggested. Knowing that I am a nervous shopper, he was able to quickly put my mind at ease with his calm demeanor and his skill level at every step of the way. While awaiting the final  few details and documents to be processed, I observed Jason and Mike RIvera with other customers, and found them to be just as helpful and friendly as they had been with me. I plan to make my future purchases at this dealership, and will recommend that others do as well. Overall, I feel blessed with the entire experience...",4.8
11,"November 18, 2013",After being turned down by so many different places we tried this dealership praying for a miracle and with the hard work these gentleman put in they were able to get me into a 2014 jeep compass!! They are amazing ,4.8
12,"September 16, 2013",Went in there to buy a new vehicle that was advertised on their webpage.  I asked to pay the price they advertised on their webpage and they said they could not honor their OWN WEBPAGE PRICES.,1.5
13,"April 16, 2013","I had shopped online a couple weeks ago for a used, dependable and yet affordable car (knowing that financing might be a challenge). Was contacted by Rhonda with Don Elliott Autoworld and then by salesman Jason in used cars at the dealership in Wharton, Tx.. After meeting in person, found that there was no way at that time to get payments where I wanted. The next day Johnny Garcia, the used car General Manager and asked me if he could ask me some questions about my credit report.  After talking he said he would get back with me.  The next day called me and said he had good news. Went that evening and he informed me that all 3 banks had turned me down, but because I was honest about what happened over the past 6 years in my life which explained everything in my credit report, he called one of the banks back and asked them to please Ty again. He told her all of what I had told him and before he could finish he said ""I don't need to hear anymore! She deserves this and she is approved!"" I was so blessed and am now the proud owner of a 2013 Chevrolet Cruze - and it is supercharged too!!!! I'm so excited!!!!!  No matter what credit challenge you may have, go to Don Elliott Autoworld, they seem to have the ability to work with all kinds of credit challenges.  Their customer service it outstanding!!!  Thank you Johnny Garcia & Jason!!!",5.0
14,"March 01, 2013",The people were very friendly and helpful to my husband and I. They did everything they could to help us find a car that meet our means and our needs. ,5.0
15,"February 07, 2013","I feel Mr. Johnny Garcia really tried to get me into the car that I wanted.  He followed up with me several times and was very thorough and straight-forward about the challenges that stood in the way for making the deal work.  Unfortunately, it was not meant to be but I sincerely do believe he did everything within his power to help me out, and for that I am very grateful. Thanks again, Johnny! ",4.8
16,"December 12, 2012","Came down to Wharton from Galveston knowing exactly what I wanted.  Their price was fair and I walked away happy.  The financing process took longer than I expected, but they fought to get me a great rate, so it was worth it.  Not a lot of pressure, very accommodating, and exceptionally friendly.  The detailing on the truck was a little rushed so they didn't get everything perfect, but the truck still looked pretty good regardless. Even spoke with Mr. Elliot and his wife while we were there.  I'd recommend Don Elliot.  ",4.8
17,"September 26, 2012","I went this past weekend to trade in my old Challenger for a new 2012. The experience was pleasant. I worked with Mike to get all the needed info in order before making the  1 + hour drive. I did not feel pressured as with other sales people in the past. The car was just as described & drives smooth. I felt very comfortable dealing with the manager, sales & finance dept. I highly recommend anyone in the market for a new car to go to Don Elliott..the drive might be far but you definitely get a good deal.  Thanks guys!!",5.0
18,"September 24, 2012","One of the most pleasant car-buying experiences my wife and I have experienced so far.  Mike Rivera was a pleasure to work with and did not use any high-pressure sales tactics.  The salesmen do not work on commission.  They are paid based on the number of units that are sold, so we did not feel pressured in any way to purchase one car over another one.  Bill Davis was wonderful when it came to discussing the financing of the vehicle with us.  Again, no pressure to include anything we didn't want, and he was careful to explain each step along the way.  We were very happy with the service and the friendly staff.  The general manager, Johnny Garcia, introduced himself to us, and is as friendly as can be.  The car we purchased will be handed down to my son in a couple of years, so we will be doing business with Don Elliot Autoworld in Wharton, TX again!  I would highly recommend shopping here for your next vehicle.  ",5.0
19,"August 18, 2012","I recently purchased my first new car at this dealership and my family and I could not be happier. 

The amount of time and attention that the sales team spent with us was excellent and we are very happy with the deal that we were given. 

My wife and I were very disappointed with many of the other dealerships that we visited and were beginning to feel all car dealerships were the same and were going to treat us the same. Our opinion changed after we purchased our car. The drive out of Houston was definitely worth our time.  

I would highly recommend shopping here for your next vehicle.

20,"July 29, 2012",Robert was very friendly and never used high pressure tactics to make a sell.  He was interested in hearing what I was looking for and made certain that I got exactly the car that I wanted.  He never pressured me to buy something off the lot just to make the sell.  Since getting my car Robert has been very helpful in showing me how to use many of the options my car has and has always responded quickly to answer any questions I had.  ,5.0
21,"July 18, 2012","My experience at Don Elliot was awesome, Mr. Johnny Garcia and Peggy didn't try to make a sale and close the door. They took the time to listen to my situation and what I was looking for in my purchase. They kept it straight and honest, before even running my credit,they took the time to figure out if they thought I had enough information and income support to get approved. Unfortunetly, on my first visit I wasn't ready. However, I didn't leave empty handed, they explained what I needed to do to get myself ready to be approved for the vehicle, rate and payments I was looking for. I got everything I needed together and went back a month later to Johnny and Peggy instead of another place because I felt like they put ""my needs"" before the ""Sale"". When I went back they looked over everything again before submitting any paper work. The whole way they made sure I understood everything, answered all my questions and got what I was looking for in a purchase. The whole Don Elliot team was awesome and friendly. I thank them for taking the time to care. I forsure recommend this dealer and will go back to them when I'm ready to purchase my second car.",5.0

23,"July 06, 2012","I had been looking for a new Jeep for a while and knew exactly what I wanted and knew I wanted to use a small town dealership that treats you like an appreciated customer instead of just a number.  Don Elliotts was just that.  I knew they didnt have the exact jeep that I had wanted, but they bent over backward to find and get it for me.  I felt like I had the whole dealership working for me.  It was a great experience.  Thank you guys!!!",5.0
24,"July 02, 2012","I went in looking for a good price on a new Chevy Cruze. They helped me pick out which model would be best for me (I went with the Eco), and were completely friendly about it. They let me test drive many times to make sure I was happy with the car, and when it was time to price the vehicle, he was open and straight forward with pricing. None of the ""let me talk to my manager"" garbage most dealers do. I would definitely recommend Don Elliott, and will be doing a lot more business through them in the future! ",5.0

27,"June 05, 2012","I knew what I wanted I had did my homework on the vehicle I was just looking for someone to give me a good deal.  I went to several other dealerships, they couldn't make it happen.  I went to Mike and right off the top he gave me what I was looking for.  I'm now a proud owner of a 2012 GMC Terrain.....Thanks Mike........

29,"May 15, 2012","REFRESHING!  That about sums up this dealership. How nice it is to go into a dealership that does not play games but instead, gives you the lowest possible price. This is my second purchase from Don Elliott and they definately have a customer for life!  Thanks for your all hard work and assistance Gary, Robert, Bill and Johnny!

33,"April 03, 2012","I said that I would never buy another Chev. I had such a bad experience with a dealership in Houston.  So when I was shopping around for a new car, I checked cars.com  I orginally went to see about a Dodge; however; for me I was not not comfrontable driving it.  I worked with salesman, Robert Miranda and he suggested the Chev. Malibu.  I just got it yesterday (April 2nd 2012) however I must say it is so easy to drive/handle.  Robert and Gary both worked with me and I believe I got the best deal ever! I've always hated car buying!! 
Don Elliott Auto World is located in Wharton, Tx. and for me it was over an hour's drive but well worth it!! If you're shopping for a vehicle, check them out 1st..I don't think you'll be going anywhere else!! Worth the drive!

34,"February 28, 2012","This is the first buying from Don Elliott. I went there cause of the online web-site it very easy to use and showed good pic's of all the vehicles. I had been looking for a vehicle for two months. I love my SUV, I bought a Saturn Outlook with the 3rd row seat. Mr. Michael Rivera was really nice and got us in a Good Vehicle and Mr. Johnny Garcia worked hard to get us financed. I will be buying another vehicle from them in the future. I recommend Don Elliott Autoworld. ",5.0
