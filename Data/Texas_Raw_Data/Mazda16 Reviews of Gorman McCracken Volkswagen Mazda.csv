0,"June 01, 2020",Purchased a used vehicle online during COVID-19 quarantine.  Spoke to salesman in depth about vehicle and their inspection.  Two weeks later vehicle indicated a drive component needed service. Local dealership estimated $1k in repairs in addition to 3 recalls not completed on vehicle they sold me. Gorman McCraken salesman and finance manager completely ignored all communications.  Finally after another 2 weeks they offered 1/5th of cost. I would highly recommend avoiding this dealer with extreme prejudice unless you like garbage.,1.0
1,"August 30, 2019",I will never buy another car from this dealership. I love the car but refuse to do business with a business lacking in basic honesty. ,3.0
2,"May 29, 2019","After seeing the new inventory online, I call Gorman McCracken to ask a question. I spoke to Mike Lopez and he answered the questions that I had and we set up an appointment for me to look at and test drive a Mazda CX-5. He was incredibly patient with me as half way to the dealership I forgot the title of my trade in and had to delay the appointment for 2 hours. Everyone there was incredibly nice and helpful and not pushy. Mike got me the deal I wanted and was the nicest salesperson I have ever met. Financing went off without a hitch, met Terese in Service and I was in and out in 2.5 hours. What a pleasure and I LOVE MY NEW MAZDA!",5.0
3,"January 10, 2019",I have had my pre owned car for 2 months. Got a recall and found out that my car had issues the dealership didn’t tell us about. The service manager yelled at my husband and the finance manager lied to us when we bought the warranty. We are of the opinion that this dealership doesn’t deal in telling the truth when making a sale. We will never go back.,1.0
4,"April 11, 2018",Both the sales agent And sales manager were excellent and providing knowledge about the vehicle and getting that vehicle financed. The salesman’s name is Dakota and I will definitely return to this dealership in the future,5.0

6,"March 26, 2018","Excellent, friendly dealership! Dakota was our salesman and he was the best! He responded fast to all of my questions, and worked magic to get us in the truck we wanted, and even had guys go to Austin to get the truck, not to mention meeting me before work to sign papers so I could be at work on time. Highly recommend this dealership & Dakota! ",5.0

8,"May 15, 2016","The staff at Gorman McCracken dealership were awesome my experience was one of a lifetime. 
James B. Maxie took very good care of me during my visit there. He made sure I knew the ins and outs of my new 2016 Mazda 6 before I left the lot he felt more like a close family friend than a sales person you can't go wrong with him or the dealership.
Thank you Mr. Maxie for taking care of me!!!!!!!!!!!",5.0
9,"January 15, 2016","We had the best experience ever at McCracken Mazda of Longview, TX. The sale's person, magic man, was straight and direct. He said he could and did make the deal happen. By the way, his name is Mr. James Maxie. Everyone must take a visit to McCracken Mazda to get a taste of the ""Maxie Experience"". Everyone at the dealership was so friendly and welcoming. I have never visited a car dealership and been in and out with keys to a new car in under two hours. This was so impressive to both my husband and I. The topper on the cake was that my twin daughters were presented the car as an early graduation present. Thanks, Mr. Maxie and the fine associates at McCracken Mazda. You can count on seeing us again in the near future.

11,"October 18, 2015","Went in needing major repairs to our '08 VW Passat. Left with a '15 VW Passat (our 3rd VW) thanks to good, sound advice from Mr. James Maxie. If we had to do it all over again, we would...in a New York second! Anyone needing a new vehicle should definitely go to Gorman McCracken and see Mr. Maxie. If he could help us, he could do the same for you. My husband and I are very pleased!

12,"October 05, 2015","From the moment I spoke with A dealership representative, I was ready to upgrade my vehicle. James Maxie, certainly one of the most professional sales guy I have ever encounter. I will refer everyone that I think wants a vehicle to James Maxie! I'm proud to have been a part of the MAXIE EXPERIENCE!!!!!",5.0

15,"June 14, 2004","The charge of $3.60 on my repair order turned out to be Gorman-McCracken charging me for the rags they use in the back to wipe their hands on.  I could buy a LARGE can of GoJo for them to clean their hands with cheaper than that.  This was a blatant, bold-faced scr**wing on the part of this dealership.  I have spent more than $3.60 on a cup of coffee, but I resent the deviousness they used to bilk me out of the money for their own costs of business.",2.3
