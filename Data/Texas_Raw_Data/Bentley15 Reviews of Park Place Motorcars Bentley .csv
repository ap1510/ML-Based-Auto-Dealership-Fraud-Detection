4,"October 01, 2016","Buying a car ""out of state"" is always a daunting endeavor but Brian  Simmons was  fabulous - both during AND after the sale. Every promise was fulfilled and  every detail attended.    He even came to our hotel on our way out of town for a final electronics learning session.  After I got home he continued to be available by phone and email to address all our questions. I love our new Jaguar F-Pace and without any hesitation , I would call Brian and return to Park Place for my future car purchases.  Gary Cunningham",5.0
5,"September 26, 2016","Brian made sure I had a great experience buying the Jaguar F-Pace Prestige. He knew everything about the car, answered all my questions and was very prompt on answering my emails and calls.",5.0
6,"September 24, 2016","Chris Fines was a great representative of Park Place.  I am a 69 year old female who happens to love cars.  Chris was supportive of my chose to order the F Pace S because he knew that I understand enough about cars to make a wise choice.  The F Pace is the car most Jaguar lovers have wanted for a long time.  I have owned three Jaguars and two Porsche Cayenne and the F Pace is my favorite.  As another admirer has stated ""this is the most well balanced and beautiful sport utility I have ever seen"".  I think Jaguar's only mistake was waiting so long to make this vehicle.  Jaguar Lovers Rejoice!

7,"September 01, 2016","Jay Bell was amazing to work with during the process and eventual vehicle leasing. I ordered a car, was constantly updated & very pleased with the entire experience. I continue the experience now that I have the vehicle. Who else does this? I certainly recommend Park Place and Jay to anyone considering these brilliant vehicles. ",4.8

10,"August 16, 2016","We worked with Jay Bell on the purchase of a new Jaguar XE, which we had custom ordered. Jay was friendly, responsive (even while on vacation!), and most importantly importantly very honest with us throughout the leasing process when going over and negotiating the numbers. He even offered to pick us up from the airport (we live a good distance away) on the day of our purchase, and he made sure everything was ready to go as soon as we walked in early that morning.

We had a minor cosmetic issue (not dealer's fault) with the vehicle that we noticed right after delivery, which Jay and the service department are working diligently on fixing this for us. Again, their service department is very responsive and friendly.

If I'm ever in the market for another Jaguar (or Bentley, Maserati, or McLaren for that matter :) I'll definitely be coming back to Jay and Park Place Dallas. I would also recommend Jay to friends and family without hesitation. Exceptional.",5.0

12,"August 20, 2015",I live quite some distance away from a Bentley dealership. Ken arranged for me to drop off my car well before opening hours on my way to DFW and then handled all the work in a timely fashion.  My emails were answered quickly and courteously and were direct to the point.  I would highly recommend the service department for Bentley servicing.,5.0
13,"December 30, 2014","I have been a Park Place customer for over 6 years and 6 Mercedes.  I thought that Park Place Mercedes sales and service was worthy of a 10, but Park Place Motorcars Bentley Rolls-Royce deserves a 10 plus.  From the time you walk in the door to the time you drive out the door the sales and service is well executed and attention to every detail is worthy of mention.  Sales staff Tim Wood, Patrick Harris and Simon Crossley provided for once an enjoyable time in the purchase of our new Bentley. Simon Crossley, Patrick Harris and Tim Wood were all involved and made every effort to see that we were well taken care of and took the time in a no rush purchase.  A test drive was insisted upon to demonstrate the feel and ride of the automobile.  Time was taken to explain and demonstrate how the automobile was different from other mass produced vehicles.  No question was stupid and all questions were answered in a very polite and detailed explanation that was understandable. The process of the purchase was well explained and with very detailed explanations on the warranty and service provided by Park Place Motorcars Bentley Rolls-Royce.  When my wife and I drove off the lot we both felt that we made an excellent purchase and received the service and time that goes into buying a Bentley.  Follow up was immediate by Simon Crossley and although a few bugs had to be taken care of at the service center a loaner Bentley was provided without question.  The Bentley is a big move up from the Mercedes, but was well worth the difference.  The whole team at the dealership made sure that it was  an enjoyable experience. I highly recommend the dealership in their attention to detail and service.",5.0
14,"October 29, 2010","Park Place backs their high end cars with top notch customer service. My local dealer didn't even respond to my internet inquiries, so I contacted Park Place (which is over 500 miles away from me) to help me get my dream car. They had the car I was looking for and was easy to work with by email/phone. I would highly recommend doing business with them and I love my Gran Turismo!",5.0
