0,"June 18, 2020","Best experience EVER of purchasing a vehicle!  My husband and I connected with Leroy Gonzales on our first visit to the showroom, and knew we had found an ongoing relationship.  Being an excellent communicator, which means listening as well as providing thorough information, Leroy guided our discernment process with professional skills and patience for my check list of needs.  As a grandmother and a cross-country driver, Leroy defined my Audi Q7 options from cupholders, safety settings, and window views from the middle and back rows for four little girls, to new procedures for a flat tire, Apple CarPlay, warranty details for a certified pre-owned vehicle (the best fit for road warriors!), and so much more.  Then our experience of price quotes from Jason, trade-in vehicle evaluation with Orlando in service department, and finally Mike with closing paperwork. . . this overall 5 star experience completely redefines customer satisfaction in auto ownership and ongoing service care!!",5.0

6,"February 20, 2020","Outstanding dealership. I wouldn't expect anything else from an Alderson family dealership. 
James Overton was our sales rep and he did an outstanding job. He's very knowledgeable of the Audi line. You can tell he's a car junky and takes pride in knowing about Audi and the competition. He's also very honest and will work hard to get you a good deal. 
We were looking for a used Q3 for our daughter's first car. They didn't have anything the first two times we visited, but the second James sniffed of one, he was on it!! Called us immediately.
Along with James, we worked with Audi Sales Manager, Jason Byford and of course the Finance Manager, Mike Tijerina. Jason was just outstanding with working the deal and Mike insisted, for some reason, that we pay for the vehicle! Mike was great as well with his no pressure approach.
As a Red Raider, I wanted to do business in Lubbock. We live 260 miles from the dealership and it was like we were in town. We basically did the deal via text message!! Just because that worked best for me at the time. They'll communicate with you however you're comfortable. I promise.
This is our first Audi. I hope to purchase more in the future. I will be doing future purchases at Audi Lubbock if at all possible. Thank you again guys!",5.0

They are in a complete different class than your typical dealership. Orlando was very knowledgeable and explained everything that was being done to my vehicle. There is not a thing he did not cover. A few months later, I purchased a 2019 Q5 from Adam Richards and again it was a seamless transaction. He went above and beyond the call of duty to assure that he covered everything on my new car. He followed up with me a few weeks after my purchase. I just cannot say enough wonderful things about this dealership. If you are in the market for a vehicle, you should give them a try.

49,"November 15, 2018","Everyone hates going to dealerships and the hassles of getting the best price, as I was expecting the same deal.  I had two cars.. one at Audi Lubbock, the other at Carmax, both Q7.  Made it very clear if I was going to have to haggle back and forth with Audi Lubbock I was leaving.  Tracy came out with a price we couldn’t refuse!  We bought the Q7!  We wanted the deal with them, so we could build a long term relationship, with a personal dealership instead of a franchise.  The only draw back as like any dealership is the lag time to buy or purchase your vehicle. Several times I wanted to leave because I got so tired of waiting.  There should be no reason for it to takes hours to draw up paperwork!  But on that note, if I would have been in and out I would not have met the two good men Adam and Mike who work there.  Mike was the finance man, such a good soul!  Adam was my punching bag, every time he showed me a feature, I punched him.  We laughed all day.  Audi Lubbock is a small, newly started dealership that is the perfect place to start your Audi commitment!  Tracy, the GM was so nice and understanding and did us right, (unlike most car salesman!)  Tammy who I initially contacted, via email,  was out for training and Henry and Adam jumped in there to help us and her, as if they were getting the sell.  Audi Lubbock is a small, newly started dealership that is the perfect place to start your Audi commitment!  Thank you! ",5.0

68,"June 26, 2018","I road in a friends 2018 Q7 on a Friday afternoon. I had been thinking of buying a new vehicle for a while, but I had little idea what I really wanted. Then, I saw the Q7. It was perfect. I researched it on Friday night and made an inquiry on Audi Lubbock's website. I got a response from Adam Richards that said he would be in contact the next day when they were open. 

WE live in Amarillo and we did not decide to go to Lubbock to test drive the Q7 until 1:30 Saturday afternoon. After texting that morning, I called Richard and told him we wanted to test drive the Q7, but we would not be there until 3:30.  He said the vehicle that I had selected was available and he would have it ready for me when we arrived. 


My wife and I test drove it, once with a trainee and then with Adam Richards. Adam gave us the real test drive and sold us on all the technology in addition to the quality and ride. We made the decision to buy about 5:30.  Adam went to work to get the vehicle detailed and gather the accessories up for us. Kudos to Ronnie (Ricky) the sales manager. He worked with me on the ""deal"" and the financing to make it all happen in a short period of time. They stayed late to get all the paperwork done. Certainly, they stayed later than closing to make sure we understood the car and that all was perfect before we left. I would certainly recommend Adam to anyone wanting a deal with no games.",5.0

74,"May 27, 2018","After being soured by my experiences at the local Mercedes-Benz and Lincoln dealerships, I decided to take the trip to Lubbock to test drive my dream car, a Q5. After entering the showroom, I was promptly greeted by Adam Richards and asked how he could be of assistance. I told him what I was looking for and he got the keys to a loaded Q5. When we hit the road, I told him I wanted to experience some of the rougher roads so I could judge the handing and the ride. He gladly directed me to the type of roads I was looking for, all the while explaining different features of vehicle. Once we were back at the showroom I told him what color I was looking for along with a settled for color which would be easier to find. They didn’t either on the lot but promised to locate one for me. 

While I was test driving, my trade in was looked over and they offered me much more than the local dealers. 

Within two days they located my first choice color, with the features I wanted and it was delivered not long after.

84,"February 28, 2018","My new 2018 Audi SQ5 had a Sport Differential Malfunction error and I live 175 miles from the dealership.  They worked with me on convenient schedules and then when the differential pump did not resolve the issue, they allowed me to drive a loaner so I would not be inconvenienced.  After Audi TAC support detailed the potential issue with the pump, the service team corrected the issue.  I am happy to have my car back.  The experience with the service department at Alderson Audi was the best I have received with any dealership.  They truly met my needs and ensured that they would take care of me while my new car was under their care.  THANK YOU!!",5.0

107,"October 15, 2017","I just purchased a new Audi A8 from Audi Lubbock and was very pleased with every part of the purchase.  This is my 5th Audi to buy over the last 10 years. up until now the nearest dealer was over 5 hours away, I was so happy to see Audi Lubbock opened last month.  I actually went in to have my 2012 A6 serviced and while waiting on my car, I got to visiting with Christian Vasquez (salesperson).  Not being pushy, he showed me several of the new features on the A6 and A8.  I ended up test drive the new A8 and really liked the way it drove. As it was getting late and I had a 1 1/2 hour drive home, I asked him to work me up some prices with my car as a trade in.  The next morning the Sales Manager, Tracy Page had contacted me and sent me a work sheet on a new A8. Tracy was easy to deal with and got to the bottom line quickly.  He gave me a very good price on my trade in and a great deal on the new A8.  I called later that afternoon and committed to the purchase. I drove down the following morning and was in and out within about an hour. Christian Vasquez met me by opening up the showroom door with my new car ready to go!  He had everything ready (paperwork). Everyone involved was very professional, knowledgeable, and accommodating. I am so happy to finally have an Audi dealer in West Texas and very pleased Audi Lubbock upholds the Audi tradition of Professionalism and Service.  PS: The Service Dept was great as well, Becky got my wife's Q7 and my A6 in and out in a timely manner.  Steve the service Manager followed up with a phone call the following morning.
