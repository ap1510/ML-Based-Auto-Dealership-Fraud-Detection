1,"August 28, 2019","Marcus and all the team at Peltier Subaru were very friendly and extremely courteous. No high-pressure sale tactics. I had all my questions answered and found the extract car I wanted, a 2020 Subaru Ascent. The financing process was easy and was explained completely. Would highly recommend Peltier Subaru to anyone interested in a new Subaru.",5.0
2,"June 14, 2019","In April of this year, I purchased a 2019 Forester Subaru from Peltier Subaru. This was my fourth purchase of a Subaru and my first purchase from Peltier, Marcus Terry was my salesperson. Marcus would receive a rating of four Stars as the best salesperson I have experienced in purchasing a car.
Marcus worked with me for several months before I made my purchase, during this time he was patience, thoughtful, honest and ethical all while maintaining a sense of humor.  I would not hesitate to recommend Marcus to you for your next car purchase.

Thank you, again Marcus for being an awesome person. 

Also, I met with Matthew Torres, Finance Manager, who was professional and knowledgeable taking extra time to answer my questions. Thank you, Matthew, for being  an excellent finance manager.

Marcus Terry, in sales, was able to help me find the perfect car for my needs and was willing to accommodate his schedule to meet mine. Casey Brown, in financing, did a great job explaining my warranty and financing options. This was my first time buying a car and it could not have been a better experience. ",5.0
4,"March 12, 2019","What a great dealership!!  Everyone was so courteous, helpful and respectful.  Our salesman, Marcus Terry, made our purchase a pleasure.  He was attentive and knowledgeable. Wonderful, sincere personality.  Jeremy Jones was also very helpful and pleasant.  Mike Torres explained the financing end of the transaction in detail and answered questions before we had to ask them.  We have bought dozens of vehicles over the decades, never has there been a dealership of this quality.  Many dealerships are dismissive of older buyers.  Certainly not a mistake Peltier Subaru makes, they could not have treated us better.  Thank you sincerely for helping us make the right car purchase for our needs.",5.0

Steven is a prime example of what a car salesman should be, very knowledgeable, professional, and honest.

15,"May 23, 2018","if steven hullum wouldnt have tried to screw me over by trying to make me pay for my trade in and the other truck i was looking to buy then i would have bought the truck... i owed lets say 16000 on my truck and he said he could give me 12000 for my truck, that is 4000 dollars in negative equity right?? now the truck i was looking at was a 2012 Chevrolet 1500 quad cab LT with 83000 miles on it values at high end 19000$ he was trying to tell me that i would have to pay 34 900 for that truck to make up the difference.. therefore he would make a huge chunk of money by screwing me over.. if u add 19000 amd 16000 u get 35000 that would mean i was paying for two dang trucks.. i didnt appreciate his cursing while we test drove i didnt appreciate his cursing while he was trying to screw me out of money,, and when he started getting loud with me i decided it was time for me to leave and never check up... he is a liar and doesnt appreciate a thing he does.. i will NEVER recommend anyone to go to Peltier subaru...

16,"May 23, 2018","Contacted Peltier Subaru after online deal fell through on another dealer for a 2018 Forester 2.5i.  Steven Hullum / Sales was very helpful in meeting my previous agreement with the other dealer.  The process went flawlessly and I appreciate all of the staff that was involved in the purchase from sales, delivery, finance, and  information/orientation about the vehicle.

Should have gone to Peltier Subarua first would have save time.

17,"May 16, 2018","Back in the day, when shopping for a car, I would be pressured. Every hesitation was instantly met with a response of reassurance that I “need this vehicle, today.”
Not at Peltier Subaru. Absolutely no pressure! And better yet, they listen to what YOU want, not insist that you need to buy what they have for sale.  Steven was great! I went in looking at a Crosstrek. He explained everything. The car was great. But to settle any curiosity, I asked if we could test drive a Forester. Again, he explained all the ins and outs, with equal enthusiasm. He let ME make up my mind.
I ended up with the Forester and have no regrets, even though I think the Crosstrek is a great vehicle as well.
Steven knows his cars! I did manage to ask a question he wasn’t sure about, but we went to the parts/service guys and got the correct answer on the spot!
In the past, the finance guys were as dreaded as the sales staff to work with. Not here! No pressure at all. They told us what they had to offer, if we weren’t interested, they dropped it. The options we were interested in, they explained all about them. If we weren’t interested after that, they dropped it. No pressure.
I’m looking forward to working with these guys in the future, but it will be a while as I don’t expect to be needing a new ride for quite a while.
If you want to go look at and learn about these great cars, this is the place to go. And they’ll let you buy one if you want. 
Thanks for the great experience guys!",5.0

I simply told him what I was wanting out a new car. We went out for a test drive in what he thought was best for me. The salesman was very courteous and eager to help. We  talked about price and financing, then he left me to make a decision. I could not wait to get back to the Subaru dealership and drive off the lot. Now I am proud to drive my Subaru WRX and hope to pass it on to my daughter when she is old enough to drive. MAYBE! ",5.0

39,"December 08, 2017","I didn’t intend to buy a car the day I walked into Peltier Subaru in Tyler, Texas. When Marcus Terry approached us, I explained that I was on a quest to decide which car I would buy when the time came to replace my elderly Buick. In a year, maybe two.

Since I left the dealership having purchased a new Crosstrek, you might expect that I got the hard sale. Not at all. In fact, that would have guaranteed I would leave without buying a car. (I don’t like to be pressured.) Instead, this personable young man gave us a detailed introduction and took us for a test drive. We were very impressed with the car, and equally with Marcus. He has a quiet confidence that instills trust.

When I changed my mind about a package I’d ordered and then again about using my Buick as a trade-in, the changes were accommodated with no fuss even though I had signed preliminary papers. 

Now about that car. I’ve owned it less than a week, but I’ve taken a few day trips and can tell you, I LOVE it! The acceleration and steering make it a dream to drive. The interior is spacious and the materials feel luxurious. I was lucky enough to find the perfect car for myself.

As for Peltier Subaru, I think Marcus was hired because he fits the norm for the company. Everyone I met was friendly—genuinely, not fake friendly—and helpful without being pushy. Authentic is the word that comes to mind.

For you dog lovers, your furry friend can accompany you throughout the process, in the showroom and on the test drive. There is also a fenced dog yard and a walking trail.

We live in Louisiana, so I worked with Steven through email and over the phone before meeting him in person.

He made our long journey totally worth it---even though a stink bug tried to take over my car! ;) My husband said that this was the best car buying experience he has been through and we would definitely consider buying from them again for our next vehicle.

55,"November 08, 2017","and Steven and the folks at Peltier bent over backwards to make sure I got the vehicle that I wanted and that fit my budget. I lost my car in Harvey and had to shop for a replacement, which is less exciting than shopping for a car when you want to. One of the main reasons I went with this dealership is Steven showed me under the hood and talked through all of the features in a very knowledgable way. Other dealerships I went to were much more gendered in their approach (assuming I would not know or care about these things, for instance), which is cliche but absolutely what happens! I appreciated the time taken to show me the car, test drive, provide me with a loaner while my car was in transit, and the discounts I received. I'll certainly recommend the dealership to my friends (already have, actually). ",5.0
56,"November 08, 2017","I have not purchased a new car for over 40 years. I always bought 2-3 year-old cars to let other people contend with the dealers. When I got ready to buy my ""last"" car, (I am nearly 80), my sister suggested a Subaru. She lives in Idaho and has had 3 Subarus and said she'd never consider buying anything else. My search showed very few cars available in my target 2-3 year-old category. The few that I found cost nearly as much as a new one. I decided to visit Peltier Subaru without making a commitment. My sales representative, Steven Hullum, just handed over the keys to a 2018 Outback and said, ""Here, take it home for the weekend."" The rest is history. I pick my new car up tomorrow. The associates at Peltier are now like my adopted family.

79,"May 07, 2017","Went in just to look around, no prior experience with Subaru. Really impressed with quality of vehicles. Steven was a great salesman, knowledgeable and polite. We weren't really planning on buying that day but they didn't play games and came at us with a great deal right away. No pressure just their best price. Great car buying experience. ",4.8
80,"May 04, 2017","I was interested in buying a new Subaru Outback or Forester.  The Outback was just so much more appealing to me but a little out of my price range.  My sales person Steven Hullum suggested I look at a used 2016 Outback with very low mileage.  I was taken by the excellent condition and many extras the 2016 had but it was still a little more than I wanted to pay.  After working with Steven and Scott the sales manager we were able to work out a price and terms I felt I could afford.

Steven is so knowledgeable and patient when working with customers, I doubt you would find a better person to deal with.",5.0

82,"April 27, 2017","My family purchased a 2017 Forester in February. Steven was our salesman, & he was wonderful! He was knowledgable, friendly, & so professional. I loved the ride of the vehicle, but we kept having problems with it & needed to keep coming in for service. I spoke to Mike (the general manager), & he INSTANTLY solved the problem by putting us into another 2017 Forester! He assured me that Subaru of America, as well as him personally, valued customer satisfaction, & felt it was necessary to solve the problem, instead of just treating the symptoms. Mike made sure that my family was given the opportunity to make any changes necessary before deciding on the specific Forester to move us into. Our new Forester has a lot of great features, & such a smooth ride!

Peltier Subaru strives to have ""truly excellent"" products & service. There are signs everwhere stating this. Based on the truly excellent customer service we have received, I am so excited to be a Subaru customer & find out what a truly excellent product it is!

Mike is running a wonderful dealership & Steven is a spectacular salesman. I would recommend this dealership to anyone looking for a new or used car. Their treatment of their customers & their concern with customer satisfaction is top notch.",5.0

87,"April 11, 2017","As my trusty steed (f150) was succumbing to the chains of fate Steven Hullum arose like a beacon of hope shining through a vast fog. Like a valiant knight he arose atop the mountain scape with cherub like luminescence beaming from his armor, that of which is made of chivalric charm and an abundance of knowledge of the Subaru line of products. Bravely he led us into battle that which consisted of vehicle after vehicle, until we found the vehicle that would change our lives forever like the holy grail appearing from the clouds of heaven. Needless to say Mr. Hullum is not just a man among men but a Subaru god, some might say, in legends to come. ",5.0

Steven, our awesome sales consultant, was relaxed, personable and informative, walking us smoothly through the whole process.  Matt, the finance manager, was also amazing.  He went above and beyond, making our needs a priority, so that even that phase was a positive experience!  The manager took the time to personally greet us and thank us for our business.  And when all was done, our beautiful new car was waiting for us, fueled up and detailed.  Just before we drove away, Victor gave us a short (just right) tutorial,  and provided us a little notebook for writing down any other questions that we think of,  even offering an incentive for bringing it back in for answers.  Excellence from start to finish!

110,"February 24, 2016","I went into Peltier Subaru to just see what was new for this model year. I owned a 2014 Camry hybrid that was a little rocket, so no plans to buy at all.  Nick greeted me and asked a couple of questions.  Not at all pushy or obtrusive, but rather pleasant and honestly wanting to help and educate along the way.  A refreshing change from the car salesmen I had encountered in the past.  After a very informative drive, then another one in a different model, I was ready to procure for myself a safe fun car  that would allow my dog to ride comfortably as well as safely.  No pressure at all during the sale, the final price was agreed upon quickly and without the "" tell ya what I'm gunna do"" song and dance I had experienced previously.  I simply could not be more pleased.  The car is cute, fun, functional for taking the dog and wonderfully safe me as well as any passenger riding with me.  5 stars out of 5 stars.  Great car, wonderful people who respect and honor the customer.  Terrific educators.  ALL GOOD!",5.0
