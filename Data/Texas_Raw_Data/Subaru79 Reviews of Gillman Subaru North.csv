2,"March 23, 2020","Patrick Clausen was the salesman we dealt with when we leased a 2017 Legacy and then purchased a 2018 Legacy.  He was the only salesman among the 6 dealerships we dealt with on the 2017 Legacy that gave a price and would not then haggle.  I had done research on pricing and reliability in advance, so I was also satisfied the price was reasonable.  We returned to Gillman North to purchase the 2018 Legacy without considering contacting anyone else, both because of Patrick and because the Subaru Legacy is a great car.  The service department is efficient, takes the time to answer questions, and delivers timely.  I cannot imagine even a so-called ""luxury"" dealer offering a nicer waiting area or better service.",5.0

This is my first Subaru I've purchased so I'm still in my free maintenance time period. When I have to start paying for services rendered I'm sure I'll be asked for another review. So far I absolutely love my Subaru Outback. ,5.0

13,"October 09, 2019","    My wife and i bought a new Subaru from them, thinking that they were a solid company. It was our first experience with owning a Subaru. We were with them for three years.  We were loyal to them with our mileage services because in the beginning we thought that we would want to stay with Subaru for a long time, and we thought that it was a good idea to have everything done through them.  We have since sold the Subaru and we went with another vehicle company all together.  The experience at Gilman Subaru North made us not want to own another Subaru, ever.  We used to think that Subaru was a dependable company, and we were excited to be Subaru owners at first.  I have not dealt with other Subaru dealerships, but my experience with this one was the worst i have ever had.  We purchased an extended warranty and service coverage that was supposed to cover service costs for up to seven years, added on the Zylon interior coating, as well as the upgraded stereo. The stereo did not really sound any different and was not that great to begin with.  I could see where the Zylon was not evenly distributed on the interior of the vehicle, and they ended up saying that we had no extended warranty and never honored the service contract.  On top of all of this, we have had some of the worst customer service up until we dealt with Nick in the service department.  Nick is a solid person, and has been the most helpful out of the entire Subaru location.  He was the only reason we went back in for anything.  There was another man that worked in the service department that was condescending and rude and made us feel really uncomfortable while waiting for service a couple of times.  They did not honor any warranties.  I never received a quote for what they were going to cover in each ""service"" and they charged over one thousand dollars for the services.  I used to be a Volvo owner for years. I never had to pay even close to that for any of my services, and always had great customer service.  The way they make their money here is by coaxing you into buying package additions and extra coverage packages during the sale while not honoring them.  I strongly do not recommend buying any vehicles from this company.  ",1.0
14,"August 28, 2019","So I contacted them about a used vehicle, wanted to trade mine in.... of course they low balled me, but I was willing to play ball.  Was told to put money down to hold car cuz i live 7 hours away. I decided not to cuz they've had car for 3 months.  When I showed Intrest and I sent pics of my car I never heard from them. I called them and asked what was going on... was told that car had sold. Oh well....  later that evening I get text about my trade.... so I guess didnt sell. Turned in credit app, it supposedly couldn't be opened online, was told to call in and give information over phone, and u get notifications that Gillman Subaru had already pulled my credit.... finance person couldn't find my application and have yet to hear about it. Then I get text that I need $2,000 down payment.... uhhhhh my credit application is lost according to them.... now they need $2,000. Really shady practices and no communication skills at all. Contacted general manager,  Mr. Mendez, via email... never heard from him either. I will not buy from them. Glad I didnt waste a day driving over there. ",1.4
15,"August 22, 2019","TL;DR I will never be buying a car from them ever again (I have gotten 2 different cars from them, and convince my sister to get here 2 different Subaru from them), or recommend anyone to buy a Subaru from them. They have dishonest business practices, and are aggressive to push into something you already informed them you do not want.  They go behind your back and inspect your vehicle with out your permission.  They run your credit, and will not tell you what you qualify for until you sign a paper saying your agree to a deal and then you get to talk to Financing manager to get your rates.  They tell you have a VIP account, but to them it means you are a sucker who keeps coming back.

Long version:
Last night I went in to talk about options of buying out my 2017 Forester XT(lease).  What really made me angry, was how dishonest they carry there business now.  While I was reading and filling out forms , the sales rep Brandon asked to see my keys so he can verify the vin# and mileage on my car.  I watched him as he goes outside looks in the window and then get inside the driver side (normal for checking vin# and milage), but then he goes back into the building (through a different door on the of the show room, farthest away from me) and comes back with another employee.  Then I see them doing a walk around inspection, WHICH I DID NOT AUTHORIZED. When he finally came back to talk to me , and started to aggressively ask questions about the car like, "" If I made any modifications to the car, how many miles are the brand new 4 month old tires (p.s miles do not matter its about how much treads it has left), or if I did anything to the brakes?""  Then he hand me a sheet of paper with vague terms ,  vague monthly payments (No mention of interest rates), and saying that they are going charge me 28k for a car that these lease buyout was 23.9k.

They wanted to charge me 2k(4k if I wanted them to make it a certified pre-owned car) just for buying my lease from me and then selling it back to me.  2k was for them to pretend to ""service"" it to make it like all the used cars they sell ie oil change, and car wash detail.  And when I ask if that fee (which they were invoicing it as ""accessories"") would include making it a ""ceritfied preowned car"" the sales rep told me to that it would be another 2k.  And then told me to certify the car would not be possible because I changed a few minor things (no wires were ever cut or modified), everything which I could of undone with in 30 to 45min.  If i knew they were going to sneak behind my back, i would of put it back to stock before I went in.  I only went there was to talk about  financing options to purchase of my lease.  Because the last car I did finance through them in 2015 (a Crosstrek), they were able to get me a better rate then any other finance source I had at the time.

The sales rep told me he would not go talk to his supervisor to see if he can alter the terms, if I did not initial he sales sheet saying that Im going to accept the deal.  Brandon started to get aggressive about suggest I should just lease another car if I want better rates, even after I told him multiple times that is not what I wanted to do.

I wish I talked to my previous sell person Patrick, the 2 times I gotten cars from him (2016 Crosstrek, finance, the 2017 Forster, lease), I did not feel cheated, and always left happy in the deal we worked settled on .  He treated me with respect and listen to what I was looking for.

Also this review is for the service side of Gillman Subaru North.  I have no issues with their service department. If your are scheduling service to be done on your Subaru, ask for Marshal the service adviser.  He has been my go to guy since 2015, each time I had to get either regular maintenance or a warranty repair, on either my Crosstrek or Forester, he has gotten me taken care of and kept me informed in a quick, reasonable , and professional manner.",1.6
16,"August 17, 2019","Bought a used car from Gillman Subaru after being assured from the salesman and the manager that it had a remaining Hyundai warranty. Everything was fine at first, until  it  started having transmission issues. Hyundai picked up the vehicle and took it to their dealership for a diagnostic review. We were told that the transmission had internal fault codes, needing to be replaced  and there was no warranty coverage because when we bought it from Gillman the warranty had already expired. The reason we bought the car from Gillmman Subaru was because the salesman and manager assured us that the vehicle had always been professional serviced  and there was a remaining warranty on it. After speaking with Hyundai USA for clarity, we went to Gillman Subaru and spoke with the salesman  and his manager.  The manager once again told us we have a warranty and that Hyundai was not being honest.  The sales manager finally called the Hyundai dealership  and found out he and the salesman miss lead us with regard to the warranty. The manager then told us he would not assist with repair cost, but would trade us out of the vehicle. Only thing was his salesmen TEXTED us, one time,  some  vehicles not comparable to what we had and  with higher mileage. We haven't heard from the manager or the salesman from Gillman Subaru and they have not returned our calls.
Honesty and  integrity are truly lacking by the person's representing the Establishment, would not recommend doing business with for this reason.",2.0
17,"May 05, 2019","I went to Gillman Acura to look at a vehicle and backed out of the deal when my wife found major damage in the interior of the car that initially missed. The next day I get a call from the associate that there was a similar vehicle in the Subaru lot next door so I went to look at it. Once there I was told that they had to run my credit again although it had been done the day before and I quickly told them no and was about to leave when they came back to tell me that they could use the paperwork from next door to make the deal happen. The day after my purchase I get an email that there was a second inquiry on my credit report. This a very dishonest dealer with shady business practices, please do yourself a favor and DO NOT do business with this dealer. ",1.0
18,"March 22, 2019","This is an excerpt from emails I've sent directly to multiple there with no response: The car was overpriced and ill maintained. I was told my car had the mats, and then after my purchase was told it didn't matter that one is missing because I bought it as is. I was assured it had never been in an accident, but when I took off the temporary license plate it was clear someone had bumped into the front end breaking part of the car and the license plate frame, and in the daylight it is apparent the bumper has been replaced. I have had over $6,000 worth of work done on this car that I purchased from you outside of routine services IN ONE YEAR. The extended warranty was sold to me as ""almost bumper to bumper"" and it doesn't even cover the entire engine. I have a terrible interest rate because when I came in, for the second time, to purchase my car your team kept me sitting in sales for over 2 hours then the finance person explained I couldn't get a better rate because the banks had closed an hour before. When I've called your dealership literally sent me to person after person who had a full inbox and didn't answer. When it broke down and I was in another city your dealership couldn't share the information for the extended warranty I purchased a couple months beforehand. I have called dozens of times, emailed on multiple occasions, and left countless voicemails.",1.4
19,"March 16, 2019","Made the mistake of trusting them in a used car purchase. Stupid, I know. Within weeks, it required thousands of dollars in maintenance and repair. THOUSANDS. I bought it as-is, so they refuse to even discuss making it right, even though it broke down just two weeks after purchase. Ethically, based on my experience, the only difference between them and the lowest, sleaziest used car dealer is the fancy showroom. Trusting and buying from them was one of the worst decisions of my life.",1.6

21,"January 24, 2019","I ordered the taillight housing for my Subaru Impreza on 1/18 and didn't hear anything until 1/23, almost a week later, when they finally acknowledged the order. They re-charged my card for the part + shipping for a total of 150.00, after I was already charged 150.00 when I placed the order.

I called to find out why I had been double charged and the guy on the phone told me he didn't know what I was talking about and he could only see one charge. He definitely didn't care or didn't want to listen- so I cancelled the order. 

I called my bank and they did in fact double charge me. Not sure if it's human or system error but I wouldn't recommend ordering here. I should have listened to the other negative reviews. Lower price isn't worth it if thats the service you receive. ",2.0

24,"September 28, 2018","
We bought a certified used 2018. I desired to see the inspection report before purchase. The salesperson brought out the service history but no official inspection report which was given to us to sign in finance Dept. I noted the service history did not show the chip repair that was located just under the eyesight center which showed on the windshield diagram on the inspection report. So I went out to the vehicle to look at the windshield and found another chip on the lower drivers side. I put my fingers over it and could feel the rough edge. Well it was fixed or filled; but, it is still noticeable and is still an imperfection in what was to be a certified vehicle. I am going back to the dealer to make it perfect. I was told that the windshield imperfections can interfere with the eyesight features of accuracy for blind spot detection etc. One other issue was we expected and we were told when we asked sales if the Forester had Android auto. Big mistake to ask as this can be a game of he said or did not say. So after we put all the paperwork in finance together and asked the salesman after the fact to show us the buyer checklist, and go over the specifics - guess what. There is no Android auto for maps on the 2018 Forester Premium. Well we were told we could get our money back by the used car sales manager. I feel the salesmen should tell the customers and demonstrate the options including the Navigation, and/or Apple Play or Android Auto which my experience has shown they do not know about the prior two items or don't demonstrate or say they are there and they are not. One other concern I have is the tailgate color looks like a slightly different color than the sides of the vehicle. I will have it put on a lift and checked out. This has been an exhausting ordeal. I love the 2018 Subaru Forester Premium with the 2.5 engine. I just hope that from reading a previous reviews on another sight that there wasn't an accident on this loaner we bought that was fixed and not mentioned on the Carfax and that is not the reason for somewhat of a difference in shading on the tailgate. I drove a 16 yr old car and had been looking for a year for a vehicle with something this 70 yr old grandmother and 72 yr old husband could afford, enjoy and keep without major repairs. I pray that these people are honest, God fearing people. One other thing, when I first looked in the area where the cargo would be and over the spare tire, there was a cargo net and the salesman 
ited it  When we went to finally review the vehicle there was no net. The salesman said it was not with the vehicle to begin with. So, buyer beware and write down on the form you sign what is owed and what was told would be with the vehicle. I don't think this item cost more than $54. So .....would I recommend the salesman???

25,"August 27, 2018","We are SOOO incredibly happy with the 2018 Subaru Legacy we purchased from Awni Kawar! He was very kind and patient with all of our children we had in tow. We told him what we wanted and he knew right away what would fit our style and size. He was able to get to the budget we could afford and when we went in to do the financing, it was super fast and all electronic. No long paper signing and not a lot of paperwork to take home. The best part about it all is we were in and out within 3 hours.....that never happens! Normally its an all day event to buy a car, I will definitely be recommending Awni to everyone I know.",5.0

27,"July 11, 2018","For the first time since I bought my car I can say I am happy with my Lancer. It started off loud and only got worse, to the point of having a feeling it was going to leave me stranded on the freeway. I had asked several people at the dealership WHY, from the start...and was being told that it is how Lancers are. Well, I picked it up today and drove the 45 min home with no noise what so ever, was able to keep radio at a normal level and not above 35 to drone out the noise...and had the smoothest ride in the year and a half I have had it. It was the front wheel bearings, and had obviously been bad since before I got it, and even with as happy as I am for it actually sounding like a new car I am equally disappointed, that I was even allowed to drive off not once but twice from that lot with only being told it is ""normal"". I now have proof that it is most definitely NOT normal...😕
 Marshal Sullivan was great in making sure I was taken seriously and treated with respect. Can not say the same for Mr David who ended up finalizing the charges as Sullivan was at lunch, he tried to charge me $400+ more then I was quoted by Sullivan, when I asked about a certain car...he was rude and brisk in telling me ""I don't know"" and walked away from me.

28,"June 27, 2018","Took my son to buy his first car. Purchased a used 2015 Subaru Crosstrek that was “100% guaranteed flood free” from Gilman website. The Car Fax report also said the same. After some back and forth negotiations we purchased. Millennial Salesman explained how good of deal we got and dealership made no money.... yep ok sonny. So after we get car home I have my son go to my trusted mechanic to give a sanity check. whithin  15 minutes, overwhelming evidence indicated it was a flood car. Sand and mud plus pink pellets used to deodorize flooded cars. Brought car back and GM gives check back with no resistance. Just felt like they were caught red handed. What is the 150 point inspection they are proud of? Add 151 and look for flood damage. GM said he would find a great deal for us and he never called back. Ended up buying 2018 Crosstrek from Westside Subaru. What a great experience at this dealership. First review I have ever done but felt I should. Buyer beware.",1.0

30,"May 24, 2018","This is honestly the most excruciating experience I have ever had with any business. I have had many sleepless nights because of the stress it has given me. Now I understand the reputation that used car salesmen have gotten. These people are straight up deceivers and connivers.

The vehicle was listing at 5511 on their website, yet they charged me 6006. They rush you through the process and kick you out the door. You see no paper work, just a big tablet (in LANDSCAPE view instead of portrait, so you cannot see the top of the document). You cannot control anything: Taylor from finance just scrolls to the bottom and says ""Sign here."" He even warned us before we started and said ""You don't want to be the first one to break this"". They then give you the paperwork on a flash drive which you cannot open on your phone, so by the time you figure out that you've been screwed by their false advertising, it's too late.

Every time you call, you are asked ""Subaru or Acura"". I tell them it's a Hyundai and they always give me an attitude. You are then transferred to someone who either has a full voice message box, or does not call you back for WEEKS.

I asked Taylor from finance if the ~6000 was before or after the 2000 down payment. He said before. He either has no idea what he is doing or is a charlatan and a liar, because it was AFTER. I did NOT go in there to spend eight grand.

The two people I dealt with were Taylor and Jay Ali. Upon entering the office, Taylor was complaining to us about the previous customers and had a chip on his shoulder that he was not getting the respect he deserved because his name tag said manager (his words, not mine). Every time we saw him, he seemed frustrated at his job and his smile seemed really forced.

Pretty much every thing Jay has said has been incorrect. He spelt my name wrong on the paper work, even after I brought it to his attention (this mistake is now cemented in stone). He keeps saying that I'm from Long Island and I have to keep correcting him that I'm from RHODE Island. We had to correct him about the trim of the vehicle he was selling us. I told him about the Gillman Promise and he didn't seem to know what I was talking about. He told me the chat window was just a robot and so what they said did not matter. I confirmed and took a screen shot proving that the chat window is a REAL PERSON. He told me that the car couldn't have been listed for 5511 because that is not a round number; I told him that the 6006 I was charged was not a round number either, so what in the heck kind of argument is that, especially when I have a PDF download of the web site listing which was downloaded the night AFTER I had bought the car. They were listing the car for a lower price online, even AFTER selling it to me for a higher price!

Now they are telling me that the extra money is because of the service they did to the vehicle. THIS IS A LIE. There were cheerios and children's toys in the back of the vehicle. Let that speak volumes about the level of service you will get with Gillman. The windshield has about five cracks in it. There is a giant dent on both sides of the vehicle. The wipers sound like Pterodactyls. The car hadn't had an oil change in 10,000 miles, and my mechanic quoted me about 700 dollars in work that will need to be done to the vehicle, not including having the transmission changed eventually because no one ever changed the fluid and now it is too late to change it because the transmission will go into shock.

PS: $189 ""documentary fee"". At my girlfriend's work, they charge a $25 documentary fee. SCAM! If they had just put ""$189 documentary fee"" on the website next to the price of the vehicle, I would have closed the page and never step foot in this place. All the taxes and fees added up to $718 (no warranty). I could have bought a car for that on Craigslist! From now on, that's what I'll do. No more dealerships, ever.",1.0

Fast forward to Monday I am supposed to pick up the car Wednesday morning . They sold the car before I could pick it up . These are true used car sales people I had the urge to wash my hands after meeting them . I guess it's a good thing they don't honor their word judging by the reviews .

The Truecar email came back with only one dealership, Gillman Subaru North, listed and for price it said ""dealer will provide price."" Then Gillman starts emailing me about coming in for a test drive and or talking on the phone. I received emails from 3 levels of management (general mgr, sales mgr, and internet mgr), and each time I asked for a quote. After the 9th day, the  internet mgr finally informs me in an extremely douchey email that it's their policy not to provide on-line or e-mail quotes and they aren't changing.

Check engine light is still on! Took it back to the dealership twice!!! We were told to take it to Autozone to let them put it on the machine. WHAT?! What kind of business is that??? Finally yesterday, 30 days, and 2 trips back for assistance was told that it was an ""external"" part of the engine that was not connecting with the gas line. Informed the service tech that I purchased an extended warranty for the car. I was then told that my warranty was for ""internal"" parts only. WOW!!! How ironic...I have not had this car for 30 days and this car has only been driven maybe 500 miles! The first car payment has not been made and we are about to spend $600 on service.

However, two weeks after the purchase the transmission went out and they didn't want to cover it or buy it back (I have the window sticker proving it had a ""Buy back Guarantee""). Also, the GM messaged me on Yelp acting concerned, asking for me to message him so when I did he never replied.  I haven't even made my first payment and I have already coughed up $1240 in repairs. DO NOT PURCHASE FROM THIS DEALERSHIP.",1.0
39,"March 31, 2016","Made an appointment to have my brake pads replaced. Waited for 3 hours before being told by the service rep that they had just put the last set of brake pads on a different vehicle. You’ll have to come back another day, he said. The rep tried to tell me that they had only anticipated a brake inspection. Even if that was true, why would you not ensure that the part is available in case a replacement is required? Excuses stink and are easy to sniff out when they come from a salesperson. This is the second time I’ve had an issue with Gillman North regarding a part. 

In September 2014, they installed a passenger’s seat switch on the driver’s seat and gave the vehicle back to me. I’m guessing the guy did not check the motor operation once he finished the job, or, even worse, he checked it, realized he’d screwed up, and had the vehicle returned to me anyway. It took me two seconds to realize the seat had horizontal movement, but no vertical movement. 

First time, shame on you; second time, shame on me. Too bad there aren’t any good Subaru dealerships in Houston.

I drove up from San Antonio, and the salesman MD Hassan already had everything ready to go.  He actually came in on what was supposed to be his day off to help me with the sale.  They didn't try to mess around with price at all.  We did the standard at every dealer add-on process, but they were not pushy.  It did take a while to see somebody at F&I - I maybe waited an hour after we had wrapped up everything else.  F&I offered all of the coverages that every dealer does, but wasn't pushy at all when I wasn't interested.  Overall this was one of the smoothest car-buying experiences I've had.",5.0
41,"October 26, 2015","I want to commend Hassan Esfaoui, my sales rep for excellent service, and attention my husband and I received when we were shopping for cars the other day.  He listened to our criteria and our particular needs and kept that in mind the entire time we interacted with him.  

I could see he is a busy man at work, and was pleasantly surprised that we started working with him right away.  Apparently the key to such quick service is to make an appointment to see him ahead of time. Then, according to my experience, his attention is solely on you, the customer.

I am very detail oriented, so I did a lot of research on various cars and asked many questions...probably more than most.  Hassan was patient and answered all of them.  The more I got to know him (for me, deciding to buy just the right car for me is a lengthy process) the more I saw he was genuine, and cared that my husband and I were given the best care and attention possible.

I am a discriminating consumer and have never taken the time out of my very busy day to stop and write a review.  However, Hassan has a 5 star rating with me and is worth the extra effort to let others know that my experience of him is that he is professional, authentic, honest and wants the best for his customer.

Hassan has my vote!

42,"October 19, 2015","We found a car that was perfect for our needs and was very well priced. We drove over an hour to test drive this car and start the long process that is buying a car. At first everything was great, very professional and relaxing. It was a bit later in the evening so we weren't able to get a response from the bank that night but we were assured they would start on it again the next morning. We hadn't heard anything from the salesman, Hassan, by lunch time so we called to check in on the process. We were told that their finance person didn't arrive until noon and was about to start working on it. Seriously? So a few hours went by and they finally called to let us know what other paperwork they needed faxed to them. Then, another couple of hours went by and they needed more paperwork. We were hoping it would go through so we could pick it up that night because we wouldn't be able to go in the next day and they would be closed the day after that. After waiting literally the entire day, and most of Saturday, we received a phone call to inform us it went through and all we needed to do was sign papers in finance and pick it up. However, we are an hour or more of a drive from the dealership and there was no way we would make it in time before close. So we told Hassan we would be there first thing Monday morning to finish and get the car. We woke up extra early to drive through terrible traffic for over an hour to be there at opening, only to find out he sold the car to someone else! We asked, and it turns out he sold it not even an hour after he called us to say we got approved! What kind of business is that? So because it took so long to get the deal to finance on Friday, we were unable to pick it up on Saturday. We spoke to him at around 7:30 and the car sold at 8. So two days we waited and sent over paperwork and we even told them we would be there early Monday to get the car. I find it distasteful that they would turn around and sell the car, knowing how much time we had invested, mainly due to their finance department, also knowing that they had a deal and would only have to wait one day for us to return. One day, I might add, that they were closed! If that is the way they do business, where customer service doesn't matter and it's about selling the car to whomever is already standing there and can get it off the lot as soon as possible, then that is their prerogative. However, after all of that, I would have at least hoped they would have the decency to call us back that Saturday and inform us that they chose to sell to someone else. Especially since Hassan knew we were driving over an hour to get there, and that we were coming at opening time. In fact, he had another salesman call us for him, after we were already standing in the dealership and learned he sold it! How very inconsiderate! That to me, is unprofessional and rude. Business is business, I understand that, and yes I was disappointed about the car, but I wasn't flat out insulted until I showed up to find that not only did they not care enough to wait one day for us, but they didn't care enough to even give a simple phone call or text to keep us from wasting a huge amount of time! Not to mention that now our credit has a taken a hit and yielded nothing! So now we have to find another car and do it again! Lord knows it will not be from this place. I will never even consider doing business here again.",2.0

46,"February 14, 2014","I bought a certified used Honda CRZ just last month! It was a lease vehicle and still had original warranty. My issue is that they promoted how they had a certain ""point"" check system for all their certified cars. Just this week a service light came on so I took my car in to have the synthetic oil changed at a nearby place. They promptly told me that there was not enough transmission fluid to even register on the dipstick. What? One month after it was all ""checked"" and its totally gone? We can only get the fluid at a Honda dealer as well.... go figure. I called Gillman to report this. How can this car have passed fluid inspection? It could have been a transmission nightmare! They said bring it in and they'll fix it. I live 200 miles away. My point is it should never have happened in the beginning. This is my third Honda and I have one more child to buy for before college. I will NOT be returning to Gillman.",2.6
47,"January 09, 2014","I have been considering several sports cars. After a friend suggested I look into a Subaru I found the WRX, and the STI to be appealing. I wing to Gillman Subaru's website to look at inventory and was offered an incentive to come in for a test drive. After submitting my information I decided to call to see if I could test drive that night. I was given to a man named Duncan who frankly seemed bored with the conversation and uninterested in speaking to me. Further, I was told that the only way I could test drive either of these cars was if we had already done the paperwork to sell it. I found this irritating in the extreme, but thanks him for his time and hung up. Several minutes later I got a phone call from another gentleman responding to the incentive I had filled out. I explained that I would not start sales paperwork on a car that I had never so much as driven. In the end we ended up in an argument about whether or not he was raising his voice.

In all, not only would I not recommend this dealership, after my first experience with the Subaru brand, I'm put off from dealing with the company entirely. Incidentally I had no trouble whatsoever test driving a 370Z which looks like the car I will purchase now.",1.0

Once we were in the dealership, Hasan introduced us to Mike Leroy who did a great job taking care of us throughout the process. He was very knowledgable, professional, and thorough in all of his communications regarding the vehicles and purchasing and financing process. I personally appreciated his approach as I did not feel pressured. This is especially important to me and made spending the day with him more enjoyable. 

Later we met Naser, who we have worked with before for one or more previous purchases. We feel he appreciated our history with the dealership and worked hard to help us be able to make a new car purchase.

58,"September 27, 2011","I bought an '06 Subaru Tribeca B9. I was referred to this dealership by a friend of mine who has sent others all of whom have bought cars with Gillman. I've been back to the dealership a minimum of 3 - 5 different occasions to trade the care back in.  The salesman misrepresented information re: the cars estimated mpg. It only gets from 14-17 mpg at best & requires premium gas which I was not informed of until the salesman handed me the keys to the car.  I can't afford this expense on my limited income and I'm currently unemployed. I have spoken with the GM of the dealership to make an approriate trade/offer on another car with equal cost and features. He at firtst tried to fix the problem by offering me an oil change if I didn't find a trade. I was not impressed. Louis called me & said he found 2 Nissan Rougues at the Rosenberg dealershp that he would trade for but they sold so he never called me back.  I have been back to the dealership many times and called numerous times.  I came in again personally and when another Nissan Rogue was found on the internet he wanted to charge $3K more for the same vehichle that he was supposedly willing to trade for earlier. I want Gillman to work with me on a fair trade for my vehicle and a fair offer for the trade vehicle that is equal to or Less than what I currently owe on the car NOT MORE $$$. I made it very clear that I need a car with efficient gas mileage, costing from $12-15K, and one that includes a warranty.  That's not what I received.  I had to pay $2K xtra for a warranty, I have a gas guzzler that takes Premium gasoline and I have a car with Navigation that is useless to me in Houston. I never received a CD upgrade for the cars Navigation System which I was promised by the New Car Salesman who said he would take care of it personally.(It is currently programmed for Illinois). I keep calling to see if it has arrived and it has never come in. 

I asked Mr. Won if there was anythign I could do to improve gas mileage.  He had no suggestions. So I called & spoke with the Service Dept to find out how to improve the gas mileage & I was informed that the car was never serviced between 40K & 60K miles.  It needs a $725 service that changes spark plugs etc. I bought it with 60K miles on the car and so it was evidently passed onto me without this required service done on the engine. Yeong Won(sp?)has personally seen me come in on several occasions and hasn't spoken with me to see if I had gotten the situation resolved.  I just keep getting handed to another salesman each time I come in.

Needless to say I've had a very disappointing experience with Gillman and haven't received satisfaction on goods that were promised nor on an appropriate trade-in. Gillman North has dropped the ball!  I would not recommend this dealership to anyone.  Everyone seems nice but no one is getting the job done.

67,"December 20, 2010","First of all, I should explain that I was a first time car buyer and a little wary of the process of buying a car. Being a younger customer and technology savvy, the vehicle research aspect of my purchase was accomplished way ahead of time. My main concern was interacting with dealers in person, I wanted to avoid high pressure sales techniques and lures that my friends, parents, and coworkers had warned me about for years. This pretty much meant that I was going to use a technique that I found comfortable when exploring my options.

So, while using online car buying resources available to me, I was contacted by Patrick Clausen from Gillman. Patrick embraces email conversation with the potential buyer, which adds a level of confidence for me when discussing details about the car.  He was courteous, respectful, prompt, and open over email about questions I had, including out-the-door price of the vehicle, and without badgering me to come in to the dealership for a test drive. This aspect of the purchasing process was very refreshing for me and stood out tremendously compared to my correspondence with other dealerships.

In the end, we got quotes from 6 dealers in Texas for a 2011 Subaru Outback. Patrick at Gillman Subaru North gave me the best price, and best customer service, of all the dealerships. I would give them 6 stars if I could for the price and service they rendered!",5.0
