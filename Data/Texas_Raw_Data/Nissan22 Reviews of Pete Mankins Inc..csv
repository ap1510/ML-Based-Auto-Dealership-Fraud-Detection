1,"August 14, 2017",I had a very great experience. I've never been treated so well from a dealership. I would say Pete Mankins is the greatest dealership I've been to and the employees treated us with the utmost respect and care. I most definitely will recommend friends and family. ,5.0
2,"August 11, 2017","These gentlemen saved the day for me! Classic Dodge had really given me a bad experience and the best decision we made was coming to Pete Mankins instead. They were so patient, thorough, and understanding throughout the whole process. They got me approved in under an hour, and made sure I got the car I really loved.",5.0

10,"July 28, 2017","Outstanding!  Having just blown a 6"" gash in my Tracker's radiator just around the corner from the dealership, I was frantic. But no worries. From first  contact to negotiations to final sale, they were knowledgeable, professional, & delightful to work with. Definitely lived up to their reputation. Highly recommended by a happy, calm driver!",5.0

13,"February 09, 2016","I am writing a review and wishing I would have read prior reviews of Pete Mankins Nissan. I can say honestly every negative review I have read on them is spot on. They are liars from the word go and will leave you feeling so uncomfortable and disgusted. Do your self a favor and shop elsewhere, I swear you won't regret it.",1.0
14,"January 30, 2014","We bought a used car and it was inspected and passed, but a month later someone who worked on cars saw our tires and told us they were bare and never would have passed inspection, therefor they passed inspection illegally. We could have a blow out any day. 

 The dealership fought, calling us liars and wouldn't help us at first, but finally after a struggle they sent 4 ""new"" tires for our car. 

Apparently, the tires they sent were NOT new they were used and in horrible shape. We found this out after we had a BLOW OUT and the car was fully inspected. We also, during this time, had put in thousands of dollars because the supposedly great car that we got a ""great"" deal on had other problems, but I did not press the dealership about these problems. 

After finding out about the tires being old. I contacted people from the dealership... 

Now the part owner of the company is telling me they never illegally passed inspection on the card, they would never put old tires on a car, and it was all our fault. He would not help us and fix their mistake. I am done playing nice and giving them chances. I want the whole world to know that Pete Mankins in Texarkana are frauds and liars. 

I was hung up on by a manager and by a part owner after they both told me I was crazy and to hire a lawyer because there was no chance we would ever see a dime.  PETE MANKINS DEALERSHIPS ARE FRAUDS. I want that burned in everyones minds so the next time you think of going to a dealership you remember my warning. ",1.0
15,"October 16, 2013",Great customer service and honest salesmen that are willing to do whatever they can to get you into a car!!! My credit isn't the best at the moment but this dealership still found a way to get me a better deal than any other dealership could. ,5.0
16,"April 25, 2013","This dealership screwed me. I bought the vehicle site unseen. There ad said I was buying a Pro-4x, they misrepresented the vehicle, lied to me, wouldn't send me the information I was wanting on it, when they brought it to me they had me sign paperwork on the hood of the Xterra, very high pressure contract signing, then as I found out the vehicle wasn't what I thought, I tried to return the vehicle 2 days later.  They said too bad, it was my problem now.

If karma does exist, this dealership will go down for their unethical practices.",1.0
17,"August 07, 2012","I have been shopping online for a 2012 Nissan Juke for couple of weeks. The one dealership that has been helpful during my search was Pete Mankins Nissan. Mrs. Sophia was not only helpful and informative she was there to answer all my questions. I was a bit about buy online from OK to TX. But she made our buying experience very easy!

19,"September 07, 2010","I recently purchased a brand new 2010 Nissan Altima from Pete Mankins Nissan and  it was the most pleasant car buying experience I've ever had. Needless to say, after shopping around for the best price, David not only beat every price, he also delivered the car to my house. LOVE their website. One of the few dealers that has pictures of every car. (prices too) I would highly reccomend Pete Mankins Nissan to anyone interested in a car. Thanks again David!  ",5.0
20,"January 02, 2010","I am a small car dealer in Canada. I bought a late model import car from this dealership figuring they would not screw a fellow dealer. I was very WRONG. 

The car was as described BUT saying it went thru their service/inspection dept is a joke, it probably was driven in one door and out the other. The brakes (front discs) were in bad shape, warped rotors. I drove it after picking it up and knew they had to be replaced (I flew down to pickup the car, hence no test drive possible). They also said the owners manual was present, it was not. I had to spend money to replace the rotors and buy a new manual. Of course not a lot of money but the principal of it all, they screwed a fellow dealer out of $300 when they could have done the right thing and addressed this but no, so I must rate them as do not do business with them. Most telling was their attitude after the sale, they would have nothing to do with me and it was 'not our problem' response. 

So avoid them like the plague.",1.3
21,"April 04, 2008","My husband and I had been searching for a car with more room for our growing family. We searched online and found a good car at this dealership. The price was very reasonable for such a new car. We contacted Dave W. immediately about this car the next morning. I was told he would call me back to get some things started over the phone (being we live an hour away) such as submitting credit app and whatnot. But, he said first things first. A huge hail storm had came through the night before, so he wanted to check our vehicle for any hail damage before we did anything. He called back soon after telling me our car was fine, and had absolutely no hail damage. Great. We proceeded with the app. and was then speaking to Dave B. After asking about the car and the condition before we drove down, we were told that our car had no hail damage at all, for the third time. I was very cautious and did not want to drive all of that way for nothing,especially with children. He called us the next morning to discuss our financing, so we agreed to come down and do some paperwork. As soon as we were walking in, I could see our car from a distance. Looked great. Someone met us at the door and immediately escorted us in to see Dave B. We continued with paperwork on the car, as we were told 4 times in total that the car was in great condition. Being it was only 5 months old and under warranty, we complied and BELIEVED both salesmen. He no more than got the folder closed on our paperwork before he asked us if we knew about the hail damage on our car?!?! We spoke up and said that they had told us there was none at all!! He proceeded to show us many, many small dings all over the car. They knew they lied to us! The nerve to make a family drive that far to be lied to! They told us right off that they would fix it with their ""dent guy"", two days later. We are going tommorrow, so we will see what they lied to us about this time...until then...NEVER EVER PURCHASE A CAR FROM PETE MANKINS IN TEXARKANA! They are LIARS..period. ",2.4
