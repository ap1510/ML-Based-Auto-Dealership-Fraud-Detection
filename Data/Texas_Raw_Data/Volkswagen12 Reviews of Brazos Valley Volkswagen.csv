0,"September 29, 2017","I took my Volkswagen CC in for service and finally got it back two weeks later.  First week - no communication!  After leaving at least 2 message to call me or my husband back each day, no one called us back.  Finally I had to drive over to the dealership to find out what was going on with my vehicle.  Very frustrating dealing with those people.",1.8
1,"August 28, 2017","0/10 recommend. They are very unprofessional and have terrible customer service. When checking in the employees were throwing an excessive amount of jokes at each other. I'm an easy going person and not much gets to me but they took unprofessional to a new level. 

I STILL HAVE a broken mechanism in my locking system despite the fact that I left my vehicle with them for 2 weeks. Any other Volkswagen would have had this done in a few hours. I am very disappointed and have decided to take my vehicle and give a different dealership in a different city my business. That's how terrible this place is. I will never be going back. 

They also tried to claim I didn't have warranty when I indeed have the seven year extended platinum pack. ",1.2
2,"March 22, 2017","Probably because I'm a woman so I don't know anything about cars, but they always try to slip in random extra charges when I'm getting my VW serviced. The last time I went they charged me for a coolant flush and the receipt said ""requested by customer"" when I did nothing of the sort. Then they told me my battery needed to be replaced (later I found out it didn't) and they overcharged me by $100 for it. Afterwards I kept getting several different error messages and my car stopped driving. I took it to another (way better) VW dealership and they said that I had a BMW battery for some reason, which was the source of all the problems and it cost me $1500 to get it all fixed. These are just 2 of many issues I've had with these people and it will definitely be the last because I am never coming back. Also the service people never answer their phone. -.-",1.8
3,"May 04, 2015","I told the dealer explicitly that I wanted to make my final decision on Monday.  We agreed to this and he told me that if I signed a few things it would speed the process up on Monday.  What he didn't tell me is that once I signed those papers I could not back out of this.  Obviously I felt like the dealer wasn't being entirely truthful with me and pushed me into something I was very clear about not wanting to do.  When I told the dealer that I changed my mind on Monday, they said they were unable to do anything and basically that I was out of luck.  As if that wasn't enough, the dealer took things out of my car before I traded it in and, without my permission, just threw it away.  When I asked him about it, he just said that he thought it was in bad condition and threw it away.  Guess I'm just out $25.

I'll admit I was an idiot when I signed those papers.  But at least I learned a valuable lesson at Garlyn Shelton, and I most certainly paid for it.",1.0
4,"August 01, 2013","Within the last year, I purchased a Jetta from Jessie and Dylan. Dylan is mine and my wife's  usual salesman, but we came on a day when he was not working so we bought from Jessie. I was extremely pleased with the buying experience as it was a no-pressure, efficient purchase. I did have a few electrical problems with the car but Mike in VW service was persistent and very helpful when the problem was not fixed after the first few visits to service. Overall, it is a 5 star experience every time I am at Garlyn Shelton because they treat all their customers like they are family. After reading a few of the previous negative reviews, I began to see a pattern. I'm not saying mistakes have never been made with my cars there before, but come on people! They deal with a large number of customers on a daily basis. There are going to be a few slip-ups. If you consider the fact that there are hundreds of other very satisfied, happy service customers every month, instead of just your own experience, it should paint a much more positive picture of the work they do. Try to keep in mind that it is in their best interest to keep their customers happy, and have some patience because it goes a long, l-o-n-g way. Trust me, you will be repaid in kind. ",5.0
5,"July 24, 2012","Jimmy was very helpful in helping me pick the trim package that was right for my family. He was very helpful as I changed my mind atleast 20 times!! After the paperwork was done, he spent another hour showing me how to use and program all the settings.",5.0
6,"November 13, 2011","Such impressive people skills!!! Not pushy and actually treat you like a real human being!! They make the experience an enjoyable one, which is rare and hard to find.",5.0
7,"June 11, 2011","Service department is terrible. I purchased a BMW with 14,000 miles in 2005. Initially service was terrific, but has degraded. It is hard to get an appointment, and they never call with back with a status, even if requested. When you call, the central number transfers you to the service desk and no one picks up. Verbal messages are not returned. I have had several minor electical problems that I have had serviced, on 3 occassions, the problem returned within 3 days of the service. It appears that they reset the onboard computer, but do not actually fix the problem. I am getting ready to trade in my 2004 BMW. I will not be going back to this dealer.",2.2
8,"May 23, 2011","I have had my jetta serviced at this dealership for a litle over a year. When parts are ordered for repairs I was not notified upon arrival. I leave several messages and the service manager is rude and belitttles consumer concerns. A young lady I think her name was Jennifer or Jessica contacted me abou some parts several weeks ago. This was a first. She was very curteous and even let me know I had 3 recalls on my vehicle. Hell she even told me what was needed to fix the manufacture errors. I explained the situation and she arranged for me to borrow a vehicle for he day at no charge, this had never been offered before. I felt confident that Garlyn Shelton had finally made a change for the better. The appoitment went smoothly all repairs and parts were installed and she even had the car ready and awaiting my arrival. I was very discouraged when last week I called to set an appoitment and went back to voicemail. No one returned my call! I went up to Garlyn to speak with Jessica o find she was no longer with the company. If anyone knows where she is now employeed I would recommend they take their vehicle to her. Garlyn SHelton made a HUGE MISTAKE leting her leave. I now ge he crappy service I received prior to her such a shame. I DO NOT recommend this dealership o anyone as their employees are too busy on their cell phones to be concerned about your needs not to mention the people are rude. The woman who now sits at Jessica's desk is arrogant and unknowledgeable as well as the younger heavier set woman whom came to try to assists and offered to help neither is qualified to be working with us nor on our jettas.

9,"December 01, 2010","Just a really good overall buying experience at the VW dealer.  They weren't pushy, they worked to get to my price, and they sold me the car I wanted.  This is what I expect from a dealer, but it can be hard to find these days.  I would recommend them and would buy from them again (as long as the service department meets the same standards).",5.0
10,"August 02, 2008","These people are amazingly inefficient.  I spent several days now calling them over and over asking to check the VIN on my car to see if it was covered by a recall... even thought I know it is, they obviously have to check.  I spoke to a kind young woman named Jessica who despite her best efforts was also unable to help me.  Some guy named James, in service/parts, kept transferring me to another individual who has yet to answer the phone or return a phone call.  Each time I call, I am placed in a never ending loop of phone tag between these individuals.  After growing frustrated, I asked if I could just buy the part.  THey said yea, sure, no problem... I'll transfer you over there... and you guessed it ring ring.. voice mail OR back to receptionist.  NEVER did I get through to a person who was able or willng to help me at all.  The receptionist Jessica, said that she hand delivered my message to whoever this mysterious person I needed to talk to was, TWICE.  And of course, I never got a call back.  I am so frustrated, I will be more than happy to take my fuel efficient car to a dealership who knows what their doing and will help me.  This is ridiculous! I signed up for this site PURELY because I wanted to advise others to STAY away from this dealer.  ",1.0
11,"November 30, 2007","My airbag light has been on for over a year.  Each time it comes on I take it to get it fixed.  Four times in a row it was the same problem (drivers side resistance too high) and they said they fixed it by replacing the clock spring (they did only charge us once, though).  Then I took my Passat in for 80K service.  The day I took it home there was an acrid odor coming from the engine compartment, the headlights/daytime running lights started flickering off and on randomly while driving and the check engine light came on.  The very next day my airbag light came back on.  This time when we take it in they say it's a totally different airbag problem that requires replacing an airbag and harness and none of the other things are their fault because they wouldn't have touched any of those things when doing my 80K check.  In fact, when you look at the 80K check in the manual, they should have checked all of these things, so if they were there, why didn't they fix them then and get that $2000 out of me?  So I find the maintenance portion of the service lacking.  Also, the service personnel (the ones who make appointments and deal with the customer) don't have a clue what they are talking about so when I ask a question about a repair they can't answer it, tell you to replace the part (even if it doesn't need replaced), and assume that answers your question.  As soon as they fix everything that they have broken, I will NEVER again set foot in this dealership.",1.4
