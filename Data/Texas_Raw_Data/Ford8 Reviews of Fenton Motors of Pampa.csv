1,"March 16, 2019","I saw an Edge I was interested in and received a call from Mike Reyna the next day along with an email. We scheduled a time on a Saturday to test drive. When we arrived we were met by another salesman who quickly put us in touch with Mike. We drove the car and loved it so we went in to deal. Mike was so very up front and worked with the Manager to get the deal we wanted.  2 hours, from meeting him to driving off with our Edge Titianium was all it took!  
Thanks Mike!!!",5.0
2,"January 05, 2018",I was given false info on the dealership after I bought a car causing me to write poorly of Fenton. I was angry and process was made so easy I bought into propaganda. Never been more pleased after 2 mths. Best dealership I've dealt with in my 19 yrs of driving. FENTON OF PAMPA,4.8

4,"March 10, 2017","Bought a low mileage pickup and communicated with Shane House, great salesman. He answered all questions, sent pictures and was there for when the transport arrived. I bought vehicle unseen and it was transported to Florida and was exactly as described from Shane. I told him I will stop to see him if ever passing through. V Rey Professional. Thanks Shane",5.0

6,"February 25, 2017",Looking for a car for my daughter to drive to college I got on Fenton website and left a brief message and in no time a sale person by the name of Shane House contacted me. A very respectful young man help me and he answered all my questions and we end up buying a car that same day. I would recommend my friends to go there to buy a vehicle and ask for Shane House. Thanks again for your service.... Jo'Ann Johnson ,5.0
7,"February 24, 2017",I contacted the dealership letting them know what I was looking for in my new ram truck. Salesman Shane House contacted me assuring me he could find me whatever I wanted. In no time at all he had the truck located and brought the vehicle right to my house. Shane went above and beyond any salesman I have delt with in previous vehicle purchases. Purchase was a breeze and they made the buying experience as smooth as could be. I appreciate the professionalism and Shane's time in finding me exactly what I was looking for! ,4.8
