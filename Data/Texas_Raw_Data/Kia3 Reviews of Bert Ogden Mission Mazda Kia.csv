0,"September 30, 2016","'twas a great experience and my salesman Red was on point! he really knows how to provide above and beyond customer experience. he sets appropriate expectations with his clients and never uses those unrealistic salesman pitch in order to close a sale. as a first time car owner (and a meticulous one), i can certainly say that i made the right choice and given a chance i'll definitely get my second car (SUV) with them. also, one of the best thing that this dealer have, is their after sale. their staff are so professional, warm and very helpful! so if you're looking for a reliable vehicle that fits your needs, budget, lifestyle and most of all excellent customer service, i'd strongly suggest this branch of Bert Ogden! kudos to the team. again, to Red and Eva truly appreciate all your help! 👍🏼👍🏼🚘👏🏼👏🏼🤓#happycustomer #1sttimebuyer #goodjobBertOgden #customerisalwaystheirpriority #highlyrecommended",5.0
1,"August 17, 2016","These guys are dirt bags!  Everything they do is deceptive.  They start by sending a personalized flyer listing a price that your trade-in is worth and offering a $1000 more.  When you get on premises your trade-in is worth $3000 less.  Next, when inquiring through the internet - the sales manager sends an email that lists the MSRP of the requested vehicle as being approximately $4000 less than any of that specific model on the lot (including the base model).  Finally, when you make a deal they want you to sign a binding arbitration agreement in case you have issues with the dealership that cannot be handled in house.  The binding arbitration agreement forces the customer to give up the right to take Bert Ogden to court.  If anyone is interested I have proof of this unethical behavior.    

Bert Ogden Mazda is the worst kind of dealership - they give other dealerships a bad name.  This dealer does deceptive things to get the customer to the showroom and then insults the consumer by requiring an arbitration agreement to cover the deceptiveness.
