1,"May 02, 2016",Scott Nefstead provided an excellent experience for me. He asked couple of questions and said i got just what you want. He was right.  Bought car that day because of the service from Scott and the dealership during the last two years after getting X3 for my wife. If you have any questions they are quick to answer and never too busy to not return phone calls or e-mails. ,5.0
2,"March 31, 2016","I live in California and had been searching for a vehicle like the one offered for sale at this dealership for months. Due to being in California, we have strict emission regulations and he was under the impression that the vehicle could not be sold here. After I did a bit of research that might price otherwise, he put a large amount of effort into seeing if it was possible to get us the car. After it was all said and done, he got us the car and even picked us up from the airport making everything a smooth and honest transaction. ",5.0
3,"September 05, 2015","I initially brought my 2009 X5 BMW into Autoplex Service in March 2015. The issue was a clicking noise which I believed was the lifter valves that had been on recall. They were replaced three years prior and were no longer covered under warranty. The car is no longer under warranty. The service department changed the oil and I was told the clicking was caused by an old battery. A new one was approximately $700. I brought it to Kroozers and they repalced it for $250.

I brought the car in again in August because the engine light had come on and the car was still making the clicking noise. They kept the car one week and I called Kendra, Service Advisor, to see what the problem was. They hadn't even looked at it. She called me back later and she told me it could be the valve lifters but they had to look in the engine. To replace the valve lifters would cost around a thousand dollars. I said go ahead and change them if that was the problem. I called back and was told by Kendra the engine  was completely filled with oil sludge. They could replace the valve lifters but that would not fix the lower damaged half of the engine. 

THE COST FOR A NEW ENGINE WOULD BE $18,000 OR $12,000 FOR A REFURBISHED ONE. I was floored. I told Kendra to please get my car ready and I would pick it up when it was available.  

I called Kendra again to expalin to me how an engine that was just fine five months ago now needed a whole new engine. She said she didn't know what happened, however because I had the battery changed somewhere else, she could not vouch for the problems. I never knew a battery change could damage an engine like that. 

I then contacted the main BMW customer service department and conveyed the situation. I first spoke with Jessica and then Skylar. He called and spoke to Kendra. Bottom line: he brushed me off and took Kendra's word. I picked up the car and was charged $667. They never even bothered to change the oil. 

I had the engine flushed, which Kendra never offered as an option, and an oil change for $140. No more clicking sound and the car is running fine. THAT WAS ALL THAT NEEDED TO BE DONE. INSTEAD I WAS GIVEN TWO OPTIONS--$18,000 or $12,000.",1.4
4,"June 12, 2012","We recently purchased our first BMW from Autoplex BMW working with Scott Nefstead.  He is polite, extremely knowledgable, and saw to our every need.  His friendly personality made purchasing the car a pleasurable experience.  Everyone in the dealership had our best interest at heart and we would definitely recommend Scott and the entire team to any potential customer.

5,"May 15, 2012","Scott went above and beyond. He was very helpful. I felt like the most important customer he had. Joe, the manager, even introduced himself to me before the deal was completed. I never felt pressured to make a decision or that they had to make the sell. I will be recommending the Autoplex to all of my family and friends that are in need of a new or used car. Thank you for making purchasing a used vehicle a great experience. ",5.0

7,"April 03, 2012",Being that I my area only have two dealershios that are close.  I choose the Autopelx first just to see how the customer service was.  I have yet to vist the other one in my year and a half here.  It was the first impression that sold me.  From the coffee to the show room.  Very pleased!!,5.0

9,"March 03, 2012","We had a great experience with Scott. Everything went amazing. We love our new car! He made it very easy for us. All of our questions were answered and he is so easy to talk to. We tried other dealerships and brands of cars, but it came down to Scott's great service! I feel comfortable calling and asking questions in the future, which is a big deal for me. Everything went awesome.",5.0
10,"December 29, 2011","We were very pleased and well taken care of. It was a refreshing experience in that there were no hassles involved in the sale, trade in, etc.",5.0
11,"September 19, 2011","I had a wonderful experience at the BMW Autoplex.  The staff, namely Scott Nefstead, was very friendly and informative as well as very swift in getting all the paperwork ready and done for us.  Also, I felt as much a part of the ""BMW Family"" as I would have if I'd purchased a new car. (Mine is certified pre-owned.)  Unlike many of the other dealerships we'd gone to they were sure to follow up with us before and after the sale of the vehicle to make sure we were totally pleased.  So thank you, BMW Autoplex!",4.8
12,"September 03, 2011","Best experience I have had purchasing a car.  I went into the dealership, test drove the car, and then sat down and only had to negotiate for about 5 minutes. Their initial offer wasn't a slap to the face and the final price was very fair.  Paperwork was done within 25 minutes.  Now that I have the car, their service remains at the top. I can call at any time with any questions. Very small dealership, but I total pleasant experience.  Not surprising that they are so highly reviewed.  ",5.0
13,"August 26, 2011","After being told my car was alright to drive, got stranded in the desert for 5hrs and lied to about the tow truck being enroute. What should have been a $200 repair ended up being $700, plus a $400 tow. 

Politely approached General Manager Jonathan Poe about making the situation right and was told to basically eff off.

15,"May 21, 2011","Scott Nefstead answered my questions and emails, got me a good deal on a new 550xi.  He explained how the car works in a clear manner.

Joe Harness was great also.  Sherman Ray and Sam (finance man) were also professional and helpful.

I couldn't find the car I wanted locally, but did find it in Amarillo.

Great new car dealer, just wish they were closer to Denver.

16,"May 11, 2011","I purchased my first car over 50 years ago. Since then I have had many new cars.
The last several years I have gone out of town because the local dealers did not seem interested in selling a car. 
 When I stopped at Autoplex that all changed. Scott knew his product, offered me a drive even in the bad weather, and did not pressure me in any way. His service after the sale is the best I have ever experienced. 
 My first stop the next time will be to see Scott and the guys at Autoplex.",5.0
17,"May 03, 2011","Best experience ever.  I did not think I could be approved for a vehicle.  Joe referred me to a credit union that approved me and then he found me an X5 that I could afford in amazing condition.  Went out of their way to get me into the car with nothing down.
Already referred someone there and they bought an X5 form noth of these gentlemen too.

Will be back in the fall to trade in for my convertible!!!

Thanks a million!",5.0
