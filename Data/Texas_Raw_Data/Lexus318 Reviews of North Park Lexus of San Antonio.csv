0,"March 10, 2020",From the moment I walked in I was welcomed in. Offered complimentary beverages and snacks. Immediately assigned a salesman to assist me (Jamie). Although I did not get the car I originally came in for I left with something way better :). Thanks Jamie and Andrew (Finance) for making my car hunting easy. The communication there is incredible. Keep up the good job guys! ,4.8

2,"February 28, 2020","JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH DWAYNE SANDERS THE REGIONAL MANAGER!  I AM DISGUSTED WITH THE LACK OF RESPECT, PROFESSIONALISM, COURTESY THAT WAS DEMONSTRATED TODAY AND EVERY SINGLE TIME I DEAL WITH THEM! I AM BEYOND UPSET WITH DWAYNE'S ARROGANCE AND SARCASTIC TONE HE USED WITH ME WHEN THEY ARE AT FAULT FOR THEIR POOR COMMUNITICATION.

THEN HE THREATENED TO TAKE BACK MY CAR AND EVEN SAID HE WAS NOT SURPRISED FOR MY EXPERIENCE. MIND YOU, MY FIRST TIME EVER LOSING CONTROL WITH ANYONE THERE. FOR THE RECORD AND EVIDENCED BY HISTORY. I HAVE ALWAYS PAID BY PHONE AND NEVER BEEN ASKED FOR A CHECK. DWAYNE TOOK THIS AS ME REFUSING TO PAY!  I HAVE NOT USED CHECKS IN OVER 15 YEARS! IM OFFENDED! IM EXHAUSTED ! IM IRATE !

3,"December 28, 2019",I purchased a jeep wrangler. After a test drive and walk around we noticed a few problems that needed to be taking care of. My salesman Ruben said no problem we'll take care of it. After 6 weeks he now refuses to return calls.,3.4

5,"November 30, 2019","Set up an appointment to test drive a car on the lot, when we showed up we were informed that we could not test drive the car due to a dead battery but could look at it. (They refused to jump it for a test drive because it was a manual transmission). I was reached out to about my inquiry ~930am and sent to the dealer ~2. Once we were there we were told that the car could not be driven and were then given about a dozen other vehicles that were available. Total waste of our time, I will never go back to this dealer.",1.6
6,"November 22, 2019","I came to North Park Lexus to buy a car I saw on your website.  John was very helpful, but after driving the car home I realized it wasn't what I was looking for.  John listened, and quickly got me into a 2019 ES350 Ultra Luxury vehicle.  It was exactly what I was looking for, and I couldn't be happier!

Thanks for listening John.  You made this former Audi customer a loyal Lexus customer.

All the best,

7,"October 20, 2019","My Sales person Tiffany Wright is exceptional. She took personal time to understand exactly what I wanted in a car. She came through with the perfect car. She didn‚Äôt try to sell me something I didn‚Äôt want. She is amazing with a passion for customers. Thank you Tiffany Wright. 
Victor Torres was wonderful in showing me all the extra warranties & savings I could take advantage of. He did a sensational job.

8,"September 28, 2019",I purchased my 2010 Lexus RX350 at North Park Lexus San Antonio and have had it serviced only by their great service department. My service advisor is Mark Micheletti and he took care of my needs perfectly. The service area waiting room is the best.in my opinion. Have a refreshing drink and some snacks in a comfortable place to relax. You can even get a relaxing back and neck massage if you desire. It may be strange to say that I look forward to getting my vehicle serviced but that's how I feel.,5.0
9,"September 15, 2019","I ordered a vehicle several months ago, had a trade-in, and worked with Tiffany. I made an appointment, and the walk-in ordering process was very smooth, all my questions were answered quickly during production, and taking delivery was a very special experience. 

To address the elephant in the room: the foremost important and differentiating attribute among different dealers is of course who can offer the most competitive pricing, and I was very pleased with the deal North Park Lexus presented to me. 

That aside, what really stood out to me, however, was the friendliness/honesty of the staff and the wide array of their delivery services. You can work pricing to be about the same at various dealers if you try hard enough and if your timing is right, so that is not really a factor. North Park Lexus stands out in everything else and makes purchasing a car ACTUALLY a happy and memorable experience! I, like most people, normally avoid and even dread going to dealerships as they can often be intimidating places, but I cannot wait to visit North Park Lexus again! I genuinely felt I was treated like family, not a ""prospect"" from start to finish, and Tiffany did everything to make sure I was in good spirits every step of the way. This is hard to find at any car dealership, trust me. Elaborating more on this would make the review twice as long. 

North Park Lexus also has a great reputation for offering various delivery/pick-up services for your new vehicle, trade-in, lease, loaner, or even yourself to accommodate whatever situation you may be in. This is especially wonderful for people who live out of town and makes life a lot easier. I believe they even deliver to all parts of the state and other parts of the country (not sure on the details).

Proof of this dealership's reputation: the area I live in is equidistant from San Antonio, Austin, Houston, with Houston being closest slightly. Almost all the Lexus vehicles I see around my area are from North Park. (Apparently this dealership also dominates south Texas and hill country regions as well from what I've heard/seen). My family has been in the Houston area market since...forever, plus we go there often to visit friends/family and run errands; but after this experience I would rather go out of my way to North Park Lexus in San Antonio for future vehicles. I don't see myself shopping in Houston anymore. I recommend anyone else looking for a Lexus to do the same.

11,"January 08, 2019",North park Lexus will sell you a vehicle in a heartbeat but service department needs improvement.

When we decided to purchase a new vehicle, there was no doubt that we would  go back to North Park Lexus. The service we have received in the past has been exceptional and we expect no less for our new vehicle. We have had two Lexus' in the past and purchased a LS460 on March 30, 2018. The staff and our salesman, Jay Kroum were all so friendly, helpful and made us feel very comfortable.  Their objective was to make the buying experience an enjoyable one, and it truly was. We are happy with our purchase and will continue to recommend North Park to our family and friends

I immediately decided I wanted to purchase one of the cars and was then instantly seen by Georgette in the finance department. Within an hour I had financing complete, my new car detailed, and ready to go. Dustin took the time to teach me all about how to use all the features inside. I was dreading buying a new car because it usually involves being ignored by sales people who don't take me seriously or being taken advantage of by men who think I don't know about cars because I'm a woman. I have to say this was THE BEST experience I've ever had at a dealership! I thought it would be an exhausting, all-day miserable and tedious event but I was driving away in my new car in less than three hours! Nikki, Dustin, and Georgette made this experience so exciting and enjoyable! I highly recommend working with Nicki at North Park Lexus. She's awesome! (And a note to management- I can't tell you how much I appreciate you having female salespeople! It made a HUGE difference in my car-buying experience!)",5.0

Working with Rhonda Locke, I determined that I would like to look for a low mileage 2015 certified Lexus RX350.
Rhonda agreed to help and I was able to purchase exactly what I was looking for, a 2015 certified Lexus 350 with 9,000 miles.
Rhonda is the person that every purchaser should expect to find.
Knowledge of the product, the purchasing options, and the willingness to go the extra miles to meet the customers needs.
Rhonda is a great asset to your organization.

- always working with other ""more important customers""
- nonchalant attitude: Take it or leave it. Very much like Austin dealerships.

Good luck talking to any of the managers. They could care less. It's not surprise the sale staff behave the way they do.

Michael Schellenger was extremely customer oriented and listened attentively to my needs as opposed to trying to sell me on any on particular model.  Although I had done my research, Mike  spent and exhaustive effort in detailing models and option packages.  In the end the NX 200 T was the obvious choice and give financial constraints, Mike was able to make the purchase fit my budget.

This is a testament and the model to follow for dealerships.   Kudos to Mike and North Park for tapping into what is important in customer service. ",5.0

279,"August 27, 2015",Just got into a new RX350 and had the best experience doing it at North Park Lexus.  Everyone was helpful and respectful.  My salesman was great he answered all my questions and was always available for more even after my purchase. He worked with his sales director on my deal till it was done. I highly recommend seeing Michael Schellenger and Joey Rodriguez @ North Park Lexus. ,5.0
280,"August 18, 2015","After visiting with a Service Consultant(Mark Micheletti) I previously worked with while previously at a Toyota service center, he gave me a requested referral to Jay Kroum whom he felt would be especially tuned to me as a slow to move prospect who might push his patience somewhat. Jay worked hard to find proper car from another Dealer and have it Qualified for Lexus Extended Warranty and worked with Tom Murders to arrive at a mutually agreeable deal.
It was a happy experience!  ",4.8

282,"July 15, 2015",I just bought a new Lexus at Northpark and had the best experience I've ever had when purchasing a new car.  My sales rep was Gabriel Martinez and he was key at getting me into the car that I wanted and patiently explaining all of the bells and whistles before I left the lot. ,5.0
283,"June 25, 2015","I recently purchased a used car from North Park Lexus.  Even though I was not shopping for one of the higher-end cars that they normally market, they still treated me with prompt professionalism.  I was especially delighted with our sales representative , Darin Van Dusen.  He was appropriately attentive and knowledgeable, but not overly solicitous--as I had experienced at another prominent dealership in S.A.  This is the second car my family has purchased from the North Park family, and I'm sure we will be back!",5.0

287,"April 06, 2015","This is the first time my wife and I buy a vehicle at North Park Lexus.  We have bought numerous vehicles at other dealerships, and this experience was by far the best we have had.  From the time we arrived, every one there were very friendly and courteous.  Jaimie Whitworth was very friendly and respectful.  He took time in showing us the vehicles ,and answering any questions we had. Lee Willis made sure we were taken care of and explained how customer service continues after the sale.   Victor Torrez also was very courteous and professional. He gave us the best financial option available.  North Park Lexus has definitely raised the bar in customer service.  We will definitively go there again if we need another vehicle.",5.0
288,"March 03, 2015","
I'd be remiss if I didn't start by saying that North Park Lexus as a whole and Darin Van Dusen in particular, are without question the most courteous, professional and well-organized dealership with which I've ever been associated.  Almost immediately, I was highly impressed with Darin ‚Äì the sales associate with whom I worked ‚Äì for how competent and attentive he was.  

Moreover, I quickly moved to ask about a 2008 LS 460 they had and he could not have been more helpful in regards.  There were a few pertinent details that I had rather elaborate (if not technical) questions on, which resulted in a full 30-minute conversation.  Mind you that, at this point, Darin had no idea that I was pre-approved for a loan yet he still took time to address my every concern, nonetheless.

(For all he knew, I was just another tire-kicker who had no interest [capacity] to purchase anything; although, this had zero bearing on his tone, enthusiasm or depth.)  This level of consideration is uncommon in any profession ‚Äì and is virtually unheard of in pre-owned car sales.  The patience and generosity of Darin was, in fact, the single most influential factor ‚Äî even more-so than pricing ‚Äî of our electing to buy from them.  And the pleasant experience was not exclusive to him:  EVERYBODY with whom I dealt furthered my confidence in North Park as well.  Victor, the finance manager, was the consummate professional while remaining both gracious and knowledgeable.  He was truly a blessing in his ability to include a warranty that affords my family peace of mind, safety, and assurance.  So many thanks to Vic (and staff), too!

Finally, if you're still unsure as to whether North Park's indeed an *elite* operation, then wait 'til you hear what puts them head-and-shoulders above the rest...

Not only did they provide outstanding service throughout the sale, but due to my rigorous schedule, they even DELIVERED THE CAR TO MY FRONT DOOR!!  Please understand that this wasn't a 5-, 10-, or 20-mile trip; it was all the way from San Antonio to North Austin ‚Äì in rush-hour traffic, no less!  Mike, Darin's assistant who so kindly helped with our paperwork, was tremendously understanding and flexible.  Around 15 minutes prior to his arrival, we had maintenance personnel show up so we had to sign the documents outdoors  :-(

But you'd never have known with Mike as he handled the situation with poise, class and good temperament.  His jovial nature allayed my concerns from not being able to accommodate him more appropriately, i.e., at our dining-room table.  So from start to finish, North Park Lexus of San Antonio has EXCEEDED my expectations of what a car dealership is, can and should be.  Working with them has greatly enhanced my impression of Lexus and has shown me what true customer service is all about.

So if you or anyone that you know is searching for an auto of any variety, then I'd strongly suggest that you contact North Park at once.  (Even if they don't have what you're searching for, then you'd be well-served to request them to locate it for you.)  Trust me:  the overall experience will be well worth the wait!  Give them a call.",5.0

290,"February 06, 2015","I have traded many times, at many dealerships and this experience was BY FAR the best I have ever had.  From the time I contacted them, to the end of the sale, I was treated very well and the staff accommodated any questions I had.  I live 3 hours away from San Antonio and the salesman, Darin Van Dusen and assistant Casey Selsor, made sure that they answered all my questions and  met all my needs prior to me coming to San Antonio to seal the deal.  I would highly recommend this dealership and have found the place I will continue to purchase vehicles.  ",5.0
291,"January 28, 2015","We bought a 2015 Lexus ES 350 on New Year's Eve. This has been the 2nd vehicle we purchase from this dealership. Our first experience, with our salesman Gabriel Martinez was great. So, without hesitation we called him up for our second purchase. Gabriel took his time and showed us every car we wanted to look at and answered every question.  He has been there for us even after the purchase. If I have a question about a feature, he will respond with an answer or suggestion. I love my Lexus and I love the service we get at North Park Lexus. I would definitely go back for another purchase, and will without a doubt seek Gabriel Martinez's assistance again. ",5.0
292,"January 20, 2015","I recently purchased a 2013 Lexus.  The service I received was unbelievable.  Our salesman was honest, unhurried, and extremely kind.  We agreed on a price for the car, but later our salesman, Gabriel Martinez, found that the car had been advertised in the newspaper for a lower price.  He initiated the change in our price although we would have never known about the advertisement.  He programmed our garage door opener, but it didn't work.  When he asked about it, I told him it didn't work.  That night he came to our home and set it for us.  Everything that one would hope for in a salesperson and a dealership is a part of the ""norm"" at Northpark Lexus.  We will continue buying our cars at Northpark and Gabriel Martinez will be the person that sells us our cars.  He is an outstanding salesperson, and an outstanding individual!",5.0
293,"February 07, 2014","The first time i dropped my vehicle off at your dealership I was given a dirty loaner vehicle, when I returned to pick up my vehicle I watched them pull it inside and was surprised and disappointed at the fact that it was filthy on the outside and just as filthy inside.  I was assured by Richard my service advisor that my vehicle would be clean inside and out when returned to me and it couldn't have been farther from the truth.  I mentioned it to the man who drove it up and he took a dirty rag out of his pocket and started wiping at my car smearing the dirty around more.  As I moved all of my belongings including my two year old and her car seat from the loaner vehicle to my vehicle hoping someone would offer some help I was amazed that no tine single person asked to help me.  I was not expecting it detailed I was expecting it washed and vacuumed as i was promised by Richard.  I expressed my concern to Richard and he offered to have my vehicle picked up and detailed leaving me with a loaner, dirty again and then returning my vehicle to me with dark muddy stains on the mats in my car that weren't there before.  The detail job was pathetic, considering you charge somewhere around $200 I would be embarrassed to say this is what my dealership provides.  

I decided to try north park Lexus again two weeks ago, my vehicle needed some work, $2800 worth as it turns out and figured the first time was a fluke. WRONG.  I dropped it off and reminded Richard of what happened the last time how my car was not clean and he assured me yet again that It would be.  Two weeks later I received my car and to say I was disgusted would be an understatement.  Once again the inside was filthy AND to top it off the man who delivered it said he had just run it through the car wash but it had gotten dirty on the ride to my house, about 30 min.  Not sure how the top of the car got so filthy on such a short ride unless he drove through the mud.  I told him it was dirty, I told him that Richard had again assured me that it would be clean inside and out when I got it back two weeks later and how upset I was.  

This is a disgrace.  I will never ever return to north park Lexus for anything in the future.  I called Richard and left a message as soon as the person left with the loaner vehicle and left him a message about my concerns and I never even received a return phone call as a common courtesy!

Is this how this dealership is run?  With a total lack of customer service?  I would be ashamed to work there.

also I just discovered while driving down the highway and my side view mirror
fell off and was hanging by a cord that the last time they ""fixed"" my side view mirrors they stripped the screws reattaching them and left it
like that. I am now having to foot the bill for a brand new side view mirror.  and repeated calls to the gm and emails to gm, owners and corporate never even got me a response what a disgrace, do not ever go here!",1.0

I found Joey to be very professional, knowledgeable and personable.  The price for my trade in and for the purchased vehicle were very fair so I was spared the uncomfortable experience associated with the negotiation process.  Ms. Aparicio was very pleasant and efficient with getting me through the finance process.  I also found her expertise to be very high and her demeanor as pleasant.  ",5.0
297,"May 06, 2013",Can't say enough good things about North Park Lexus. Purchased auto from NPL online almost 1000 miles away.

303,"September 17, 2012","Overall, I had a great experience buying from North Park Lexus of San Antonio.  

A few years ago, I worked with Jamie Brennan to find a new SUV.  Ultimately, I chose another manufacturer's vehicle; however, when I called Jamie about wanting to buy a car, she actually remembered me. I realize that isn't magic, but it does show they believe relationships are important.

Jamie was very patient as I attempted to choose the car that would be perfect for me.  We did most of our prep work via email, which is very convenient for me with my crazy schedule.  When I was on the lot, we got right to work.  Within less than 48 hours, I was picking up my new vehicle.",4.8
304,"September 16, 2012","I purchased a used Toyota Camry from North Park Lexus.  It was clearly not a big money maker for them and yet they treated me as if I'd purchased a top-of-the-line Lexus.  When I got the car home to Austin, I realized that it had a problem (which was not their fault) and that any other dealer would have considered trivial. Not only did they take my concern seriously, but they sent a driver to Austin to bring me a loaner and take my car back to San Antonio to address the issue.  North Park went above and beyond to not only solve the problem but to even enhance the car!  Michael Shellenger, Tom Murders, Tony Palumbo and even the owner stepped in and were responsive, honorable and fair. I recommend North Park Lexus without reservation.",5.0

It was not even close ... and the shocking thing was the others were all really good ... North Park was just GREAT!
