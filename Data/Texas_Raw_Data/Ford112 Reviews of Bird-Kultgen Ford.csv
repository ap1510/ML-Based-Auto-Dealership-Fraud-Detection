From the beginning of the process, I was greeted by very friendly employees quickly evaluated and taking care of my needs. Adam was top of the line sales and for my next vehicle, I would seek out Adam to help me.

11,"March 01, 2019","My son's diesel truck broke down and was towed to BK Ford. They said the diesel looked cloudy and assumed he put the wrong gas in his diesel truck. Our insurance company took a sample and sent it to an external site for evaluation; it came back as diesel. The truck then sat on their lot for over a week before anyone looked at. When the service department finally looked at it they said it just needed fresh fuel and a new fuel filter. A new filter had been installed approximately one month prior. They did not run any diagnostics on the truck and took 7 days to even look at it or test drive it. The service rep (Leslie) did not call with any updates, and could never provide a clear answer for when the truck would be looked at. She continued to tell me how busy they were when i asked for a timeline.The service department is also closed on Saturday. I would not recommend this dealership to anyone.",1.0

15,"February 23, 2017","I have been a customer for the past 17 years. I trust one sales person...Tim Pietsch. He has been helping me find the perfect vehicle every time I come to see him. He is kind and never treats me like a customer but a friend. He goes above and beyond to find the right vehicle for me and my family. Since I have been his customer for the past 17 years, he has become a manger. He also has an excellent staff. Ernest was very kind during the sale of my new car. I will continue to come back to Tim because I know that he will do his best for me and I can always trust that he is going to get me the best deal. Thanks, Tim.",5.0

18,"February 28, 2016",I had an awesome experience with bird kultgen ford in purchasing my first ever new car  and a new ford at that. Mr. Mike Kinsler was an all round professional sales consultant he helped me out a lot by pointing me into the right  direction of purchasing a new 2016 Ford Fiesta that I love!!,5.0
19,"November 05, 2015","Took car in on Monday and on Wednesday called to get an update.  After being put on hold twice waiting on my service rep the phone system transferred me elsewhere.  The ""elsewhere"" lady was very nice and I asked to speak the manager.  She transferred me to the manager, but he was not in either so transferred me back to ""elsewhere"".  I told them I would just come pick up my car.

Upon arrival to pick up my car they seemed surprised to see me and that I would pick up a car that was a safety hazard to drive.  Informed me I should have been given a loaner (rental car), and the original person I spoke told me she would make me an appointment for a rental car which I declined.  Upon returning back to work I did get a call from the person I had tried to call twice for service who was surprised I picked up my car as well.  I explained to her my situation and that I had made an appointment with another Ford Service center to get my car repaired.  She did not understand how they could get the parts so fast.

I was just so disappointed in the service and lack of follow through.  I like to deal locally as much as I can, but to be honest the people out of town seem to want my business more than they do locally.  Love Waco , but not this dealership.  ",1.2
20,"September 28, 2015","My experience was excellent!! I live in abilene, tx and was able to work with them over phone. Very pleased with the customer service over phone and when I was able to pick my new car up. I recommend anyone to bird kultgen. My salesman (Ernesto Ramirez) was very good at his job, and friendly. Got me into a 2016 ford escape!! Very pleased with the work he did.",5.0
21,"September 30, 2014","I bought a certified pre-owned Mustang at Grapevine Ford. I noticed that it sounded like my driver seat motor had a stripped gear not allowing it to move up. I thought, ""no problem, I'll go over to BK Ford set up a time that I could bring it in and have it checked out. Mind you this is Tuesday. I was told that they are booked for the week and come back sometime next week?? 
I asked, "" Can I make an appointment?""
Service Writer - ""No just bring it in early.""

Thinking to myself, its only Tuesday and your already booked, how is next week going to be any different??

I further go on to explain, that I accidentally programmed a MyKey to my car. I asked if it could be removed. 

The service writer, who was giving me completely contradictory information from what is in the owners manual on how to turn it off,  was not listening to what I was telling him.  I don't have an admin key to turn off my key! The admin key programmed to the car must have been lost by the previous owner. He told me there was nothing they could do then.

I HIGHLY recommend that you not go to this Ford dealer for service. They are SLOW and CONDESCENDING and don't listen to what you are telling them. 

I will gladly not bring my car her for service ever, not recommend this service department to anyone, and let everyone know about this experience!

I will drive the hour and half to Grapevine Ford. I already called them and they have a spot open and ready for me at my convenience. BK Ford should take a note from their customer relations!

34,"August 19, 2013","When Kirk showed us the Focus, which I had come to see, I drove it and found it too confining. Next he showed us the Fusion which was awesome, had everything I wanted and needed, but hesitated at the price. Kirk must have sensed my sportier self and asked if we wanted to look at the Mustang. That was all it took. I was sold. Now I have no idea if it is as confining as a Focus, but being a Mustang makes it all forgivable. ",4.8

Also was impressed with your extended warranty plan and bought it for the Fusion. the service department washed and cleaned the car and put a full tank of gas in it....we are from Mexia and are very impressed with all departments and employees at BK Ford! Tim gave us a bit of encouragement that will never be forgotten.  No wonder so many employees have such long tenure with your firm! We will definitely come back for another look when the time comes for another car. Everyone who made eye contact with us said ""Hi""- a nice touch! I think the transaction was a 'win-win' for both parties!",4.8

58,"April 12, 2013","I began my search for a new car online.  Bird Kultgen's inventory attracted me to their website, after I completed my online browsing, I received and email from Vanessa Bounds offering help with setting up an appointment to look at a few vehicles.  Soon after I received an email from Eric Jones offering his services.  Eric was extremely helpful and informative with our decision on which vehicles we were interested in.  Eric showeed us several different vehicles and the features that each vehicle offered.  He fit us with the best vehicles based on the features we described were important to us.  Phillip Howard made the experience relaxing and worked with my wife and I to get the vehicle we wanted for the price we felt was in our range.  Paul Carrizales continued the great service once we moved into to finance.  We never felt pressured or hurried, I can honestly say that we felt as if everyone actually cared that we enjoyed our experience while shopping for a new vehicle.

I was also filled with gratitude and felt ""highly honored"" to have the President, Mr. Peter Kultgen himself of Bird Kultgen to take the time out of his demanding schedule to make sure I was enabled to secure the vehicle to meet my needs.

86,"July 24, 2012","This is the second car I have bought from Eric Jones and BKF.  He is unbelievably knowledgeable about the different products.  In working with him, I was able to see he truly cares about his customers as he was very respectful of my wants, limits and even my time.  Both purchases had me at the dealership after dark to finish the paperwork and he nor the finance manager or sales manager (?) ever conveyed it was inconvenient.  

Also, I previously had a Ford Edge serviced there as well as collision/body repair.  My daughter has a 2003 Ford Explorer I have had serviced at BKF as well.  The service department, especially Wes and Jason have made every effort to get the jobs done.

Since I have used the New Car department, Body Shop, Rental Car department and Service department, I can speak with experience.  BKF is very service oriented and and and has done a great job every time I bring a car in.  ",4.8
87,"July 23, 2012",I GAVE THE RATING THAT I DID BECAUSE AFTER GOING TO ANOTHER DEALERSHIP AND BEING FOR THE MOST PART BLOWN OFF IT WAS NICE TO BE ABLE TO GET RIGHT IN AND TALK TO A FRENDLY SALES PERSON AND ALSO GET WHAT I WANTED OUT OF MY TRADE IN AND ALSO THE PRICE WAS AS CLOSE TO WHAT I WAS WILLING TO PAY THAT I WAS GOING TO RECIEVE.,5.0
88,"July 20, 2012","I was very satisfied with the service provided by BKF in Waco.  I purchased my 2012 Ford Escape in April, and have been satisfied with it.  When the time comes I will be purchasing one of your excellent Ford Ecoboost trucks.  Thank you",5.0

92,"July 14, 2012","Working with Eric was a very pleasant experience.  He's not only knowledgeable but he is a very genuine, friendly person.  He honestly values his customers' time and is very prompt with appointments.  Our past experiences at Bird-Kultgen were with Tim Pietzsch and they were excellent.  Eric is a continuation of the excellent sales service we had rec'd from Tim when we purchased our 2002 and 2005 Explorers 10 and 7 years ago.  

Besides the excellent sales service, another good reason for buying another new vehicle from Bird-Kultgen was because of the excellent experience we've received from the service dept the past 10-1/2 years, beginning with Wes, Leslie and Bobby.",4.8
93,"July 13, 2012","I brought my truck in for warranty work. After the problem was addressed, it was solved. A slight snafoo on payment, as it was warranty work, but all in all was great.

94,"July 05, 2012","Mr. George was very friendly and provided us with the best care any dealership could have offered.  He listened and worked diligently to get what we needed.  We loved the picture on facebook and his explanation of the features on the car before we left.  Thank you Bird-Kultgen Ford for taking care of our needs!

98,"February 08, 2012","Enjoyed the overall experience in dealing with Leigh Ann during the purchase. She was very knowledgeable and very helpful. Paul went right to work arranging the financing for us and got it approved to our surprise -- we have just emerged from bankruptcy and didn't expect to get approved so quickly and easily. Two very fine representatives of your dealership. If I should have any repairs of any kind, I would expect to get the same treatment from the others involved. ",4.7
99,"February 04, 2012",They were SO very helpful! My new explorer had the cooling fan go out and my vehicle overheated while I was out of town with my 9 month old son. They fixed it then and there so we didn't have to get a loaner and come back from out of town again. The woman who helped me came to check on us multiple times during the hour we were there. Great dealer!,5.0
100,"February 04, 2012","I got a warm welcome from Bobby Devorsky,including a handshake. We talked about what I needed. Bobby said he would call me and let me know what my vehicle needed and what it would cost. He saw that I got a ride home. He called me to say what I needed and the cost,just like he said he would. When the work was completed he saw that I got a ride back to the shop to pick up my vehicle. He greeted me when I returned and explained the work that was done. He walked me to the cashier,thanked me again for my business and we said our goodbyes. I was greeted by the cashier and once again was thanked for my business. By the way,my bill was a few dollars less than the estimate I was given. ",4.8
101,"February 04, 2012","Instant service. Answer to the problems on my vehicles under 24 hours. Exceeded work estimated time frame, instead of two days it took only one. Very honest, even when discussing their own vehicles. Was told to stay away from all 6.0 diesel engines and was even advised to sell the one I had due to very high maintenance costs. Honesty goes above everything. Thanks again. Billy",4.8
102,"January 29, 2012","Leigh Ann did an excellent job listening to my wife and I.  She worked with us to find a vehicle match, and came back with an offer that was fair to all parties.  We bought two new vehicles during our visit, and she played a critcal role in us achieving our goals.

Well done, and we look forward to our next Bird-Kultgen experience!",5.0
103,"January 18, 2012","This is the 4th vehicle I have bought from B-K.  I would gladly send other people to your dealership.  In fact, I already have!  A lady stopped me in the parking lot at Region 12 and wanted my car -- I sent her to y'all.  Phillip is great.  I went in and told him and Bill which car I wanted and how much a month I wanted to pay.  I was driving my car the next evening.  Love you all!",4.6

I received good advice to help me make decisions concerning the service I needed.  Waiting area was comfortable and coffee was very good.  Easy access, quick turnaround time with quality service are important to me and I've always found that to be the norm, both in sales and service, at Bird Kultgen Ford. ",5.0
106,"January 11, 2012","I had a problem with my passenger side door handle (the chrome was peeling) along with a few other minor issues. After talking with the service department, I discovered that it wasn’t a warranty fix. Well the service department found a recall on a related problem with the handle and worked out both issues with the door as well as the others at no charge. Thank you for working with me and keep up the good work.",4.6

108,"January 10, 2012","I will not deal with a company that does not treat me with courtesy and respect.  It is a simple thing to do and there are other options when it does not happen.  I was treated tremendously at Bird-Kultgen Ford and now consider them a first-class organization.  Every detail was covered in the buying process, and customer service was always on their minds.  I was amazed and delighted!  So far, my purchasing process has been a pleasure.  What that means is I will probably be back and tell others.  Bird-Kultgen, ""ya did good!""  Thanks...",5.0
109,"December 07, 2011","My ederly mother had a old farm truck hauled their for and estimate to get the truck running..Leslie called her and stated well it needs tires which will run $500.00, She then said ok..Then Leslie called back and stated it needed another $500.00 to get it running..So my mother is thinking &quot; ok &quot; right at a thousand to get it running correctly..So she said yes..Only to get another call from Leslie stating the bill is now at $ 1400.00..and the truck still needs alot of repair..( THIS TRUCK IS A 1992 FORD TRUCK)Can you beleive this..Never have I been taking advantage like this before..Why couldn't  they tell her .Hey the repairs will exceed the value of the truck..They could have sold her a used truck on their lot, or a new one..with being honest and not trying to nickel and dime her ..I was and still very angry how they have treated my mother and I'am sure others..They being a dealership should be able to test and evaluate a problem and give a fair estimate before doing anything..And should be able to stand by their work..Leslie has called my mom back today stating they will drop the charges from $1400.00 down to $300.00..I still think this is quite unfair..

With this experience I personally will never buy a FORD from their..Funny my mom was looking at a new Van from their but now has decided not to..",1.4
110,"May 17, 2011","I went to Bird-Kultgen to purchase my first new car.  They were wonderful!  They took the time to find me exactly what I wanted and get it to the dealership quickly.  They gave me a very fair trade-in price, no interest financing, and a wonderful final price on the car.  The sales people were so friendly, and the financing paperwork was quick and painless.  Since purchasing the car, I have gotten my first oil change and had a good experience with the service department, too.  I would recommend Bird Kultgen to anyone!",5.0
