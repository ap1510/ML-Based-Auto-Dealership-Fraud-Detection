0,"May 21, 2020",Wanted to add electric brakes to my Ram 1500 and opted for a factory install rather than an aftermarket look. We returned to Brenham CJD where we bought the truck to get this done. Excellent experience in every aspect from setting up the appointment to driving out with the job completed; true professionals. I highly recommend them to anyone for purchasing and for service after the sell.,5.0

22,"February 09, 2018","David Lawrence was great working with us on the phone and internet coordinating our effort in buying a new Ram 1500 Lonestar. We made our agreement one afternoon and drove 160 miles the next morning to finalize purchase. The finance group was great setting the best deal on the purchase and the financing. The make ready crew busted a extra effort getting our truck ready ASAP. We left around 1:30 and was back home by 4:30. Give Brenham Chrysler a shot. I don't believe you'll be disappointed.
Thanks to the whole crew...nothing happens that's worthwhile without a Team effort.

Dwayne Dailey was my Sales person. He was excellent. Car was ready when he said it would be. He reviewed the vehicle operation, programed my phone, and went the extra mile to deliver the paper work.

A good hand and would recommend him to friends..",5.0

35,"November 22, 2016","We were looking for a specific jeep and located it online at this store.  I called and confirmed the car was there before I made the hour long trip to buy it.  We took it for a test drive and agreed to the asking price as per the internet add.  When we were brought the agreed upon price everything was in order except the price and an additional line item.  It was purchase price + TTL and something else.  When I asked what the adder was it was explained that it was nitrogen in the tires/ wheel locks/ and GPS tracking devices in the tires.  They refused to sell at the advertised price, so I did not purchase the vehicle.",2.0

41,"November 17, 2014","My car wouldnt start and it was the remote key, Lalia jumped in her car and came to me with a battery to see if that was the problem,  It was not the battery . It was determined to be the thing that reads the key ,I was surprised when she said no charge for her coming to help !!!!! Something rare this day in time .........I had my car towed to the dealership Friday night ,and had it back Tuesday after lunch ( seeing as they had to order the part ) I am super happy with the service I received and will have no problem using them in the future !!
