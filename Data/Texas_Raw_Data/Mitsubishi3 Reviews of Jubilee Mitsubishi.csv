0,"April 23, 2012",I bought a car from this dealership a little over a year ago...love the car...but the dealership its self is very un professional in the sense you dont sell my trade in with license plates on it registered to me!!!! its been 13 months since ive traded my old vehicle into these guys and now im getting toll fee bills due to there error!!! IT IS AGAINST THE LAW TO SELL A VEHICLE WITH THE PLATES AND REGISTRATION STICKER STILL ON IT FROM THE PREVIOUS OWNER!!!!I have and will continue to contact TxDOT until this issue is resolved to my satisfaction because I havent done anything wrong yet im the one developing the headache of dealing with this issue...Thanks jubilee for over sight!! ,3.0
1,"October 15, 2011","Worked with their sales Rep/General Manager (David Gray) for a few weeks to have a vehicle delivered to me. Kind of felt like we were playing the ""Let me see what I can do for you car dealership Game""... Overall I think the sales rep's were decent people but just holding out to make more money then give a good honest quick sale. I didn't need financing had no trade in and had cash or check for whatever vehicle I wanted. I just wanted the right price for it! Ultimately got the exact same vehicle I was negotiating with them on, for the Price I requested from them through the Automax Dealership in Killeen. Had the vehicle verified, Checked, Price negotiated on and delivered to my residence at no extra charge within 48 hours. Paid cash & had a quick no frill's no B.S. purchase experience. Which was exactly what I was looking for. Like I said the sales per's seemed nice but unable to come to a final price that should have been easy to negotiate too instead of the ""Let me see what we can work out"" salesmanship ploy. Wish them the best & hope everyone has a good cost saving experience with whatever dealership you decide to go through. But always remember there are plenty of dealers out there & they should always give you an offer you can't refuse.... They would have had my business then & in the future. Now I'm just waiting for College Grades to come back after this semester to see if my oldest gets a new car too. Don't think I'll be going to Jubilee though. I don't like wasting time.

2,"January 27, 2011",Went in today (12/28/10) just browsing for a vehicle with no expections of leaving the dealership with one. Sam Daniels worked with and for me throughout the entire process. I was approved and on my way with a new vehicle before I knew it. The approval process was painless. Thanks Sam! Youre the man!,5.0
