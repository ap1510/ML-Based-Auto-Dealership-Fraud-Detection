6,"April 27, 2020","Took my vehicle for an oil change,  which is expensive ($87), and when I went to pick it up the next day,  it still wasn't ready.  It was 1 hour to closing so they took my vehicle in right away and 30 minutes later,  it was ready. Because they forgot my oil change,  they didn't charge me which I thought that was fair. ",3.0

15,"December 31, 2019","Very poor customer service. Took in our truck at 9am for an alignment and for them to check the bearing on front tire. When taken in they had no other vehicles for services. I had to call twice in order to get a status update on my vehicle. The first time I called was at 2:30 and Mr. Campos began to say that something else was wrong with our brand near 2019 truck. He stated that he would call me back with an update and let me know when it would be ready. Two hours later and no follow up by him. I then called back and spoke with a young lady she was able to find our information about my vehicle and told me it would be ready at 5pm. A whole day to do an alignment is ridiculous to me and the fact that the service advisor could not be helpful is sad. When purchasing the vehicle they paint a perfect picture on how helpful they are but then when it comes down to it they are unwilling to help! Very disappointed with their service, too lazy and don’t want to work.",1.0
16,"November 01, 2019","I purchased a 2019 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon on October 9, 2019. Today is November 1st. My trade-in has not been paid off. I spoke to Chrysler financial and they have no loan information on me. I contacted Ed Payne Motors in Weslaco and they had no clue that this was going on. They made some calls and apparently my file was not found. The next day “it was located” and they were going to expedite it. A week later, I check online and noticed that my trade-in still has not been paid off and now there is a late fee. I called Chrysler FInancial and AGAIN they did not have any information. I contacted my sales representative AGAIN and I got the same story. He stated they would “rush” my file. A few days later—-still nothing. The sad thing is that I gave them a stellar survey but the post customer service was completely unacceptable—-horrible. It is like they do not care. I told my sales rep that I expect to speak to a manager and no one has called me. I emailed them but no reply. I left a message on their web site and guess what?? No reply. It is apparent that after the deal is done customer service is non-existent. Therefore, I caution anyone who chooses this dealership that they treat their customers as a simple number and if you need anything after the deal—-good luck. ",1.8

18,"August 07, 2019","I can't say enough about our salesman George ""Jorge"" Garcia.  He is simply amazing.   We are a hard case and he took such good care of us.  He worked so hard for us.  He made us customers for life.  If you need a vehicle he is your man and Payne is your dealership.  They make you feel like you a million bucks!!!",5.0
