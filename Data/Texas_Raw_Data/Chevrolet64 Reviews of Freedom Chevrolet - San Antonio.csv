0,"June 16, 2020","MILITARY AND VETERANS BEWARE OF THIS DEALERSHIP BECAUSE THEY DO NOT CARE ABOUT VETERANS.  

1.Had a quote off of the USAA car buying service.  Took it in with me and they manipulated the figures on the purchase agreement  and screwed me out of $1578.00 by selling me the car at MSRP, rather than the quoted price on the deal.  The additional Dealer adds were OK, but disregarded the option agreement completely to get the extra money!!
2. Mark Montz the Finance person completely lied by misrepresenting the facts of a (so called extended ) warranty, he sold me and then delayed getting the policy facts to me and filed the loan with USAA rather than waiting as I asked him to do until he got me the facts.  The cost of the warranty was $2,275.00.  Then after me putting down $10K on the vehicle the dealership drug their feet about cancelling the misrepresented warranty and then did not want to inform me about getting my money back so they would not double dip by getting the money again on the loan.
3. The General Manager Adam Scott has never returned my phone calls or e-mails asking questions about the sale and warranty so I had to go in personally to try and talk with him about the problems, and when he realized I was there left the property to keep from talking with me. I have never met or talked to any Manager, even though they swear in their form letters about the sale to treat you like part of the Chevrolet Family if you purchase a car from them.   Would hate to be part of their family.
4. This dealership seems that their business goals are to squeeze every penny out of you that they can, no matter what devious things they have to do to get it.
5.Bought the car on 5/15/2020, and the loan has still not funded because of screw ups on the loan paperwork as of today 6/19/2020.   Mark Montz was more interested in selling me a bogus warranty than getting the paperwork correct.
6.  Wanted me to come there to give them my signatures to fix the title paperwork so I held my signature hostage from them until they refunded my $2,275.00.  They even wanted to send someone to my house to get the signature, and I told them to stick it, that they could send the paperwork to me or forget it.  
7.  Found out that these shenanigans are not infrequent.  There have treated other buyers just as bad.  Probably Veterans they are doing it to!
8.The General Manager Adam Scott does not care about the veterans or customers and how his representatives at his dealership treats them , as I am still waiting on him to call me and talk.   
9.  I have been concerned about driving the car, because until it is titled in my name what would they try and do to me if I had an accident.  I have  fully insured the vehicle, but this dealership is so corrupt that I do not have any trust left for them.
10.  I am 67 years old, and have bought several cars from dealers and this is the most disgusting and frustrating car buying experience  I or my wife have been through.  If you are smart stay away from them and go somewhere else to purchase a Chevrolet.  YOU WILL BE GLAD YOU DID!!!!",1.0
1,"April 08, 2020","I went to Freedom Chevrolet with the full intention of purchasing a brand new truck from this dealership. The salesman who was helping me was named Jarren. I looked at two different trucks when I went in there on Saturday but they just seemed to be too expensive and out of my budget. I was willing to go over numbers but Jarren was being very pushy with the whole ""If I get this monthly payment, can you sign here so I can earn your business today."" He also stated, ""I just want to make sure you are 100% committed to us as we are to you."" It sounded like they didn't want to help me if I wouldn't buy the truck that day, BUT I originally told him when I got there that I would be getting information today and I would do some research and then hopefully make a purchase that same week. Also, he acted like he didn't want to waste his time...AS IF I WASN'T THE ONLY CUSTOMER IN THE DEALERSHIP. I thought maybe I could make it work, but again I told him that I would do some research and get back in contact with him in a couple days. Two days later, I reached out with an offer on a different and less expensive truck than before and told him that if he could make it happen then I would come in that day and buy the truck. I specifically told him on the phone and through text that I did not want to come in if they couldn't make it work due to a medical condition and the COVID-19 outbreak. I was extremely clear with my offer and request. He texted me shortly after and asked if I could come in. I asked if everything was good and he got the okay from his manager, Charles. I asked twice because, again, I did not want to come in if not due to my medical condition and risk of getting the virus. He told me everything was good to go and to come in to complete the paperwork. I drove in to the dealership, which is about 25 minutes away from my house. Sam, a different salesman helped me out with the paperwork, and he had no idea about my offer or what was going on. Sam seemed genuine and was more of a help than anyone. He asked Jarren and Charles what was going on then they both came over to go over the numbers. Charles said, ""I thought as long as you were good with $550/month then you would buy."" Funny thing is, I never once went over monthly payments on this truck with them because I did all that math at home. The paper they pulled out was nothing like the offer I gave and it was way over priced for a vehicle that was not worth what they were trying to sell it at. Again, Jarren said, ""we have a great deal in front of us and we can get you in the truck today."" I showed Sam the text messages from Jarren showing he agreed to my offer and asked me to come in. At this point, I was extremely upset that I wasted my time, risked my health, and came in because he had agreed to the deal. It was all a lie and a game to them. They do not have the best interest of the consumer in mind. Everyone was extremely dishonest and shady. They probably thought because I'm only 24 and want to buy a new truck..they could take advantage of me. Everything about that felt fake. I will never go back to freedom chevy and I recommend nobody else do business there. They obviously lack integrity there.

There's a reason why they only have 2 out of 5 stars on their reviews.  ",1.0
2,"March 06, 2020","My sales experience was pleasant, and my salesman seemed to go above and beyond to earn our business. However, my experience after the sale has left a lot to be desired. I found out after purchasing the car that there were two important features  (related to charging the vehicle) that were verbally described to me as being included in my vehicle purchase, and after purchasing the vehicle when I looked into how to use these features (I’m new to EVs) I discovered that they were not actually included in my particular vehicle. Shame on me for trusting the professionals to give me accurate information about the vehicle I was purchasing. So when I reached out regarding the absence of these features, the initial response I received was an apology for the misinformation and a commitment to make amends. However, after that I was met with almost 2 months of radio silence as I reached out multiple times to follow up about the issue. I ultimately contacted the general manager, who not only refused to take any responsibility, but he actually had the audacity to blame another dealership for their mistake, and then to imply that I had perhaps fabricated the whole issue after the sale. 
Meanwhile, in the service department, I had to take my new car in to get a faulty USB port repaired, and it took 3 months for them to repair the USB port. They blamed GM for sending them the wrong part (more than once) and thus delaying the process, but sometime in the middle of the 3 month process I heard the technician refer to my vehicle as a ""hybrid"" and a ""Volt,"" and when I got my keys back they were labeled ""Chevy Volt"" (it's a Bolt EV), so I have reason to suspect that they didn't know what kind of car they were working on and were likely ordering parts for the wrong type of vehicle. To top it off, when I got my vehicle back (after 3 months), I got it home only to realize that there was vapor barrier hanging out of the passenger door panel and so we had to bring the car back there yet again to correctly install the interior door panel. 
So overall, at this point I do not actually recommend any part of this dealership if you truly want the “lifetime customer service experience” that they sell you when you purchase a vehicle. If you are looking for well-informed, honest professionals who will provide an excellent and timely customer service experience even *after* they’ve sold you the vehicle... you may need to look somewhere else.

3,"December 24, 2019","Total waste of time.  Had a 9:45 AM appointment for a 2 year service maintenance and after the truck sat for two hours without any attention, I departed.  Of course I got all the typical excuses from the service advisor but when he said it typically runs 1 hour and 45 minutes I asked him why do they set appointments.  I was asking for an oil change and tire rotation.  I spoke to the service manger who had I don’t care attitude.  When I purchased the truck two years ago the sales person did not recommend their service department....I thought I would give them a try but wasted two hours.  Also when I asked the service advisor for more information about the brake recall letter I received from zGM he acted like he did not know anything about it and suggested I bring in the letter. After he scanned my VIN on his iPad, he came back and said yes there was a software update that would take 45 minutes for each of the two updates.  I lost confidence in their skill in doing the right thing to my truck and will never step foot in this dealership again....how do they stay in business....I was one of three in the customer lounge waiting....poorly ran operation.",1.0
4,"December 22, 2019","I had a very frustrating experience with one of the service advisors.  I spoke with Brandi over the phone to schedule a diagnostic check for the battery on my 2017 Camaro.  It had been sluggish to start a couple of times and I couldn’t reach it to check it myself.  I dropped it off on Oct 30 at 5:30pm and left it overnight for an appointment the next day at 7am.  When I got there I gave the keys to Brandi and asked her to also have the tech check an issue I had with the steering.  I waited all day on Oct 31 and Brandi finally called at 3:15pm to tell me that no one had even looked at my car yet.  I asked her if she was expecting me to leave it overnight and she said it’s looking like that’s the case.  And when I asked if I could get a rental she said none were available.  She had waited all day to call me to let me know no one was going to get to it because they were backed up from the previous day, when she could have warned me when I dropped it off or called me first thing the next morning to give me an opportunity to arrange for transportation.  But what’s even more absurd is that it’s a 15 min job to do the diagnostic at the very least.  I never expected to have to leave my car overnight for TWO NIGHTS for a battery diagnostic & steering check.  I guess it was my mistake not to just bring it in & wait for it, but I don’t have that luxury with my schedule.  So over the phone I told Brandi to forget it, I’ll take it elsewhere to get it checked and I went to the dealership to pick it up just after 5pm.  To add insult to injury, when I walked in to the service dept I stood around for a good 5-10 minutes while Brandi spoke with not one but two techs and didn’t even acknowledge me...standing IN FRONT OF HER. RUDE!!! Another tech finally spoke up & Brandi gave him my keys & told him I didn’t have any work done & I was ready to go...she still didn’t say one word to me. I was so offended.  I wasn’t the one who dropped the ball & I had a right to be frustrated...she didn’t have the right to completely ignore me while I was standing right in front of her. I even tried contacting the service manager Rick Lawver via email TWICE and absolutely no response. Do NOT waste your time going to this incompetent service dept",1.0

6,"July 31, 2019","I was looking for a good car. I noticed online that they had the car that I was looking for a Dodge Challenger 2018 model. I ended up popping in unannounced on my contact Jacob Glass. This man was very friendly and didn't dive right into the what I call typical dealership questions about myself my family my work etc etc. After some small talk he brought the car around and we went for a drive I was thoroughly impressed with the car. I asked him a lot of questions and he answered just about all of them that he could. We went back and sat down crunch some numbers but couldn't come up with an agreement. (Bummer) We smiled and shook hands and I Departed. I would recommend this dealership to anyone and above all Mr. Glass. He was very professional with me and I enjoyed our laughter and love for cars. He's an excellent partner for this dealership.

7,"July 05, 2019","I scheduled to have service done to my car. Once I arrived at the dealership and was told that two services that I requested could not be done, because they were backed up and tomorrow they have a event going on. This should have been explained to me before I got there and not upon arrival. Service Advisor was nice and respect, but would have want better communicate before arriving with expectations.",4.4
8,"May 16, 2019",My friend and I came in to see if she could get into a Silverado and we were greeted by Greg Held. He asked a few questions before he made a point of insulting her previous car buying decision. This is not a strong arm technique but rather a sure fire way to lose business. He flat out ignored everything we were saying. I have never felt more disrespected at a car dealership before. I had no problem walking out on him without warning. Greg needs a refresher on customer service skills before taking another customer. ,1.0

11,"July 10, 2018","I leased a 2016 Tahoe from this dealership. Now I would like to look at other options due to a change in my financial situation plus I am driving so much more. I have called numerous managers, including the general manager on a daily basis. NO ONE will call me back anymore to help me. I’m disgusted with this dealership and will ensure everyone knows how awful they are. I do not have time to go sit in the dealership to get the run around. ",1.0
12,"July 28, 2017","Bought a $70k Tahoe, they sort of tossed the owners manual to us after we closed, someone had removed the wheel lock keys ($2500 upgrade we didnt want) and when we had a accident and needed the wheels removed, Freedom was unresponsive and waiting on them to correct their mistake caused us $1000 car rental and a month of not having our vehicle. And their service department is so bad our salesman suggested we always go to a different dealwr unless we wanted to waste a lot of time. Never again!

Right away, they made us feel welcome.  Casper asked my husband a couple of questions then brought up a truck that fit the bill!  We drove home in a new truck that day and my husband is so happy!!!  Thank you Casper and Freedom!!",5.0
14,"May 04, 2017","Had totaled my truck. Actually it was a 12 year old FX4 that I had bought new. I had driven a red Ford pickup since 1989. I had looked at a few Silverados as a possible replacement at a couple other dealers. My wife and I had just finished looking at trucks at the last dealer, leaving disappointed. She suggested we go to Freedom. I liked ""Casper"" right away. Kent (Casper) Kasperski asked me one question, ""Did I want leather?"" A few minutes later Casper pulled up with the perfect truck. I drove home in my new truck 2 hours later. Casper is the man.",5.0
15,"April 29, 2017","Do not go here! We were traveling from out of town, and our Saturn broke down. We were told it would be a $7,300 charge for new transmission. We had it towed it home to Orlando Florida, and our mechanic changed fluids, and checked our car completely, for $200. It has been driving fine for 2 months and almost 1,500 miles. We were told by Freedom that the car had been test driven, but the mileage was the same as when we drove into the dealership. Neither the general manager nor the service manager could give us any explanation, nor provided ANY service recovery!  I feel they both just shrugged their shoulders! I'm glad we do not live in San Antonio and need this dealership. If it were our parents, or someone older, they would have had to have it fixed in order to get home. Please pass this along!",1.2
16,"April 29, 2017","I used consumer reports car buying services.  I was contacted by Casper Kasperski (spelling) who was very helpful.  However, another dealer had the exact car I wanted at a good price, Malibu Premiere without driver conf packages, so I bought it there.  There was no pressure from Casper, and every time we were in contact, he showed me the utmost respect.  Thank you.",5.0
17,"April 24, 2017","Being a first time buyer, I couldn't have asked for a better experience, Casper was awesome, he made sure we were taken care of.

19,"April 06, 2017","My dealership and my salesman (Casper) were terrific! Everyone was nice, responsive and knowledgeable. They beat the competitors price and took good care of me. They went out of their way to accommodate all the little details that have to be taken care of to buy a vehicle. I would (and have) recommended them to my friends.",5.0
20,"March 16, 2017","My husband and I have been on the hunt for a Toyota 4Runner with a certain color combination. We walked in to the Freedom Chevrolet and was immediately greeted by Kent ""Casper"".  
We were at the dealership 30 minutes before closing time and you would have thought we had all the time in the world. Casper had a warm smile on his face and took us over to look at the car and once he saw me smile, he went ahead and got the keys to take it out for a test drive. 
There was no pressure or haggle, we went inside to start the preliminary process realizing it was getting late. Capser made my husband and I comfortable and offered us water and great conversations. We quickly knew God allowed us to meet for a reason. We went ahead that Tuesday finished up the credit application and went home to only return the next day to finalize.  We are so grateful to Kent and the finance team who worked with us to get us the lowest interest rate and was able to customize the payment term month to fit the budget.
We traded in our '96 4runner for the '15 and praying this new one lasts just as long! The entire process beginning to end was beyond easy and effortless. We drove away in our new 4Runner and am very grateful to Casper and all of his assistance. HIGHLY recommend him to anyone who wants an enjoyable experience when purchasing a vehicle.",5.0
21,"March 13, 2017","This dealership has lost their way.  Do not buy and never look at this place for service. They took advantage of my niece and told her a bulb needed to be replaced and that the bummer need to be removed to get to it. It happens as always they didn't need to pull the bumper and will not refund a $64 charge for a simple bulb. All of this was of this was after they charged her over $200 for work not needing to be done.

23,"February 28, 2017","Freedom Chevy was an amazing place to do business. Kent ""Casper"" Kasperski was my sales rep and he found the exact vehicles i wanted to see and ultimately got me into a Silverado that I had been dreaming of! The finance department did more for me than I could have asked and got me set up with a financing option that fit my situation perfectly. NO PRESSURE from these people any step of the way. The detailing department did beyond an outstanding job taking care of my truck, Armando was more than willing to take care my needs after receiving the truck as well. These are great people who are very easy to work with! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED ",5.0
24,"February 21, 2017","Service department at Freedom Chevrolet is terrible and unsafe. My first experience left me with tire bolts for two tires not tightened, which almost worked the way off while driving. Second experience to have front brakes replaced required two trips back to the dealer, one by tow truck, to correct the issues caused by what is believed by a different dealer to be incorrect brake pads used. While on the phone with the service department the manager proceeded to make derogatory comments about my husband while speaking with a technician. I can only assume he thought we were on hold. Almost two weeks later for what was to be a simple brake pad replacement I finally have my car back. In the end they did replace a couple of parts and replace all tires. An apology would have gone a long way, instead there were excuses and cover ups that do not fit. I will never visit or recommend this dealer. ",1.3

Not only did they match the price of the dealership, they had the vehicle ready to go within the hour. Best car buying experience ever and the Mario was the ultimate professional!

29,"August 25, 2016","This pertains to customer service and sales management. Goes back to 2013, purchased a brand new 2013 Silverado LTZ. the day I drove off the lot, the truck would shake real bad. Being service was closed, it took the sales rep 3 weeks to set up an appointment. Sales rep blamed service, service blamed sales. Issue never fixed, was mad because of their delay, they would not take truck back and i was stuck with problem. Truck shook so bad the passenger seat look like it was going to go through windshield.  Showed them videos and pictures and then my sensors started messing up for rear parking. According to dealer nothing was wrong with truck. Even with all the proof i had. After a over a year, finally they accepted lemon law. Another dealer confirm the issue and found out this was a dealer trade truck. Which would explain why they couldn’t find truck in their system. But they still short handed me 4k. 

Now, i got a 2014 Silverado high country. Their top of the line, 55k truck. When the deal finally went down, i was going to get a brand new truck with 8 miles on it. Come to find out, they traded that truck to Devine dealer. So now another day and now got a truck that was driven to and back from Devine. Now truck had even more miles, 100 to be exact and bass on stereo to max. Then, it leaked from roof. They first fixed the satellite,  then they messed up headliner, it rattled. Leaked again, Then they replaced seals around moon roof. They.  messed up headliner again. Then leaked again, the replaced the moon roof and seals, make them replaced headliner which they had to pop windshield out. They replaced windshield 3 times, they scratched my truck, they broke my light switch, the rear view cover, and headliner is now warped around moon roof and still raddling. Till this day theu cannot fix the raddling and every time it goes to dealer, they brake something else on truck. 

And guess what happen now, my truck is leaking water again. GM sales, general manager from dealer and service manager still don’t want to accept this is lemon. By lemon law if you cannot fix vehicle they have to buy it back. Two main issues, leak and headliner raddling. Now they want to fix the satellite yet again. 

Beware, I recommend buying from a dealer that will work with you and accept the lemon law. Both trucks have been at dealer more than what i owned them. I have escalated up the chain and finally working with attorney to file lawsuit against dealer. Do go to this dealer or service dept. If you do, check your vehicles that nothing else is damage and that they fix the problem correct. Could be my bad luck but I have seen in person other customers psssss that they did not address the issue at hand. 

Hope this helps with your decision from buying from this dealer.

30,"August 25, 2016","I thought freedom was a 'dieing service' dealership. Had lost all hope in freedom service department. Until my recent service. Taking in my 2016 corvette for some warranty work, when a new service advisor by the name of ?ROMEL ECHAURI? Changed my opinion on this service department. His customer service and building a long lasting customer relations is 'Top Notch'. Freedom Chevrolet should really value his his partnership. In fact I would suggest that freedom reevaluate they're servicing approach and relations/standards to be at par with Mr. ECHAURI. I am now looking to have Freedom as my primary servicing facility for all my automotive needs. Thank you Mr. ECHAURI and freedom thanks you too, for I am forwarding the survey throughout my engineering company and Affiliates. Jovan martinez 2016 stingray

I spend THREE Hours on the phone with Greg Hill tonight trying to purchase a used Honda Civic for a commuter car to NYC (I am a medically retired fire chief from NYC who now works in Fire Protection in NYC).  First this individual said they do not accept credit cards because they had people buy cars with fake cards/drivers licenses (RED FLAG).  Second they do not accept bank checks (RED FLAG).  They wanted a wire transfer which I agreed to do.  They had me send a copy of my license and insurance card.  First was to e-mail which I was told that they have a bad e-mail system (RED FLAG) and to text him the photo (RED FLAG).  After all this I was told finance people would call me right back (I was wiring full payment??).  After an hour I called back and was told he is really busy and they would call me right back again.  Nothing.  After several attempts to re-contact - nothing.  I reached a ""Used Car Manager"" named ""Cody"" who looked into it and then called back and said they were no longer going to do the deal.

35,"October 16, 2015","I took my truck in for some warranty work because my ac went out. I dropped it off that morning as soon as they opened. I asked him to change the oil and check the door locks because some of them dont work with the remote. I was told it would be ready by the time i got off at 4pm. I get there around 430 pm and my truck wasn't ready. I had to wait until about 7 pm before it was ready. Oh did i mention he called and told me i needed front brakes and gave me a good quote to replace them including machining the rotors. I get there i asked did he change the oil and check the locks? His response  was oh I forgot I'm sorry. I tell him don't worry about it I'll come back another day. I'm standing outside waiting on him to pull my truck up, he gets out and tell me the squeaking will go away in a few days i tell him ok. The next morning I wake up for work and guess what my ac isn't working again. It's a 100 degrees outside and it's hot. I take it back up there he calls and tell me they didn't notice it was a wire that melted. Again when i pick it up I asked did you change the oil and check the door locks and he forgets to take care of that to. My brakes are still squeaking he advised me to give it a few more days. I take it back up there a few month's later because my brakes are still squeaking. I walk in everyone looks at me and put their head down like they were busy.  A gentleman after 5 mins passing sir we'll be right with you. A few seconds later a female walks in and eveyone ma'am can we help you. I didn't say anything. I finally get asked can i help you?

37,"August 08, 2015","When I was shopping for a Volt, I knew what color and package I wanted. I searched, and talked to all the local Chevrolet dealerships - one of which is within walking distance from my home, and none of them had what I was looking for. Freedom Chevrolet is the only dealership that was able to find the Volt I wanted, and had it shipped from Houston to San Antonio for me. All of the service work has been great (and they fully charge the car, too!), and the service team is very accommodating. I am a very happy Freedom Chevrolet customer!",5.0
38,"July 30, 2015","I bought a Traverse elsewhere and started having air bag issues, the recall work was done by this dealer, it took some investigation to find this out.  When my current dealership looked into it, every time the light came back on it was a different type of issue with the repair that was supposed to be done by Freedom.  CAUTION It was such a hack job my current dealer could not believe it.  Three months later my vehicle is properly fixed.",1.0

40,"June 01, 2015",I purchased a Colorado.  Walter Koch walked me through the steps of ordering the truck directly from the factory.  Walter kept me updated throughout the process of building the truck.  Walter and the rest of the staff were superb customer service ambassadors.  Walter reviewed the order and also demonstrated every feature that came with my Colorado.  Freedom Chevrolet is lucky to have an employee like Walter. It was my best car buying experience in over thirty years.  Great Job!     ,5.0
41,"April 20, 2015","While traveling though the area, we had a breakdown.  We live in Wisconsin and knew no one in the area so we call AAA.  Eagle One (Gilbert) arrived with a truck that towed our pickup and 5th wheel. The next morning Gilbert found the only Service center who promised to look at the truck before Tuesday- Freedom Chevrolet of San Antonio. The service consultant (Paul) called later that day and promised to squeeze it in as soon as possible.  Paul and his assistant Debbie kept us informed of the progress.  Paul contacted our extended warranty carrier and later wrote them a letter and called them to help us get a settlement.  Paul and Debbie were respectful, polite, caring and understanding of our situation.  Thanks to them our truck was repaired and we were back on the road Tuesday.  I can not say enough good things about our experience with Freedom Chevrolet.  I can in good faith say I highly recommend service consultant Paul at Freedom Chevrolet of San Antonio, Texas.",4.6

43,"March 23, 2015","On a whim one Saturday, I reached out to express interest in trading in my Sonata for a Traverse. Walter Koch immediately responded to me,& after finding out more about my motivation behind my interest in a Traverse, we set up a time later that day for a test drive. Upon arriving to the dealership, Walter had a white (color of my Sonata) Traverse cleaned, up front & ready to test drive! My daughters & I never had to deal with ""walking a the lot"" -- 1st class service! But the white one wasn't quite equipped the way I would want, so I ended up test driving a Black Traverse with EVERYTHING we could possibly ever want! Unable to complete signing due to time of night,( kids were hungry ) I was allowed to take the vehicle home. Which gave me time to think.... the white one wasn't enough of what I wanted, but the one in my garage was Much Too Much of a Traverse for me to feel comfortable with purchase. So, regrettably, somewhat embarrassed & reluctant I told Walter- it was just too much. I still wanted a Traverse- but I didn't want THAT one. Walter was very understanding & graciously took the time to locate my PERFECT TRAVERSE & the dealership sent for it, & I couldn't be happier with it!!! I was never pressed or rushed to make a decision, Walter was understanding & supportive of me wanting a different one, Walters' Boss & the finance personnel I met during the experience were all very nice & easy going. If ever anyone was troubled by my changing my mind throughout the entire process- I never knew it. Great experience over all. :)

46,"February 28, 2015","I had an amazing experience purchasing my Camaro SS from Freedom Chevy.  I have purchased many automobiles from various dealers and hands down they were the best. I purchased a 2015 Camaro SS through the USAA/True Car buying service & was immediately contacted by Walter Koch.   He is, in my opinion, a true professional who honestly cares about people.  He was not pushy, worked with my schedule & when I told him I would be special ordering my SS, he had the work sheet and had done research on building.  I test drove an SS on the lot & had what I was looking for in the car.  Walter helped me with all the discounts I had with GM/GM card & had all the paperwork ready with breakdown of price, credits and total.  He also, introduced me to the service department.  Walter was truly amazing and helpful.  I then went to Finance and was met by Joel Juarez.  He was very professional and helpful and finalized the deal with no problems.  All together this was a wonderful experience.  Walter was phenomenal.  I witnessed him with other customers and he was the same as with me.  I would recommend this dealership to all.",5.0
47,"January 24, 2015","I am extremely disappointed in the quality of customer service at Freedom Chevrolet and will NEVER step foot into their dealership again. They have absolutely ZERO loyalty. Here is our story: My wife and I went in on a Thursday evening after work to look at a used vehicle we had been researching online. I called ahead and was told the car would be available for a test drive in one hour. We when arrived one hour later, the car was not ready, in fact, the entire rear bumper including the tail lights had been removed because they had to do “a paint job to fix a big scratch on the bumper” (which they failed to mention on the phone one hour earlier.) Because of that we were unable to take it out on the public roads for a test drive.  Upon inspection, even without the bumper, the car was in really good shape inside and out, and multiple times we expressed our strong interest in the vehicle, even saying that we would buy the vehicle today if we were able to take it out for a drive.  We were told the car wouldn’t be finished until late Friday evening, so we scheduled an appointment to come in for a test drive (and vehicle purchase) early Saturday morning. The salesman inputted all of our information in the computer, included notes that stated we were unable to test drive today and will be back on Saturday morning. He even told his manager, “We are going to make this deal happen on Saturday, I’m going to take care of them.” He told us, “Don’t worry, the car will be ready for you guys on Saturday.” I called the salesman on Saturday morning only to find out that the car had already been sold. At this point I was extremely disappointed and expressed my frustration saying, “I’m sorry but this is bad business to treat your customers like this especially those who express a strong interest in buying a vehicle.” He then proceeded to tell me, “Well you could have bought the car on Thursday, but you decided not to and no you’re wrong… its good business” and hung up on me!!! My wife and I are very disappointed with this experience, especially since we just purchased a brand new vehicle for her from Freedom Chevrolet two years ago. WE WILL NEVER SPEND OUR HARD EARNED MONEY THERE EVER AGAIN! ",1.0
48,"December 13, 2014",I took my 2014 Chevy Corvette Stingray in for some warranty work and I dropped my car off with the service department at 9am. The appointment was scheduled. I went to get my vehicle at 4 pm and was told that they didn't get to my vehicle. The reason given was that the mechanics were overwhelmed. Wow!!! then don't book an appointment with me is what I thought. Lousy experience. Corvette Owners and other car owners beware. This place has lousy service. It is what it is.,1.0
49,"August 18, 2014"," sold the first Camaro I owned right before I deployed in 2011. I knew I wanted another, but couldn't find the right one. I started the buying process with a dealer in California, but they kept messing up the contract, so I had to cancel. 

I walked into Freedom not expecting to find anything on the lot. I was right. Nate, the salesman, DID find the exact car I was looking for ... several hundred miles away. I already knew I didn't want to pay a shipping fee to have it brought down here, but I told them if they could find a way to get it down without it costing me anything, I was in.  I figure they could have just as easily pushed one of the cars already on the lot on me. They worked out a dealer trade and Nate personally drove one car up there and brought back my Camaro! Not something they had to do - it's not like they're hurting for cash or anything.

That's the kind of service I'd like to receive every time I buy anything, especially something so expensive.",5.0

53,"April 12, 2013","Since the top reviews are negative here, I thought I'd share a more positive experience. My Hummer developed a clank that 8 trips to various dealerships around Texas could not solve. Freedom came recommended when I relocated to SA, so when I took it in for routine PM I mentioned the annoying clank that I'd given up on having repaired. Brian told me he couldn't guarantee results on that... two hours later he called and said they'd found the problem (I'd heard this 8 other times from the other dealerships)... he also said they could do the repair work under warranty, so I ok'd it. The other dealerships had also done warranty work: U bolts, engine mount brackets, shocks, etc. to no avail, so I was still skeptical. The work was done in a timely manner once the parts came in and I drove away that day in the quietest ride I'd had in 9 months. That was 7 months ago and there's still no clank. I've been to this service dept three times since for routine PM and have always received great service. I'm giving overall experience a 5 because not only is the work done well, the waiting room is nice with an ample Keurig supply.",4.2
54,"March 23, 2013","I made an appointment as requested by the dealership for 11am.  When I showed up, early I might add, I was told they were busy and my vehicle might be diagnosed but would not be repaired that day.  I asked then what was the purpose of making a appointment to which he just shrugged his shoulders. The service advisor new apologized for the issue and only made excuses.  Also the customer before me came back from the waiting area got his keys and left as well!!  What type of customer service is this. I should have read the reviews here before wasting my time.  Looking at the dates of the reviews it seems their customer service has not improved.  Those 5 star ratings have to be employees making up stories.",1.0
55,"September 07, 2012","1. Waited almost 30 minutes to get helped after making an appointment.
2. Had to pay for the same service twice within 6,000 miles because of different failures.
3. They made no effort to find the root cause of the issues.
4. They tried once to get Chevrolet to cover the problem... After that, it was up to me.
5. They lack expert diesel technicians to service the diesel vehicles they sell.
6. Had to make multiples calls on multiple occasions to get a return call.
7. Manager said he would call me back with a ""special"" discount to try and help.
   7a. He didn't call back, he had the service guy call.
   7b. The special discount was 20% off. Since I regularly received 10-15% that was insulting.

The bottom line is that I have spent thousands of dollars over the last 10 years doing business with this dealership. It seems they have gone way downhill since being acquired by a company out of Houston. Given their shop rates and lack of expertise and inability to do things right the first time, I'll be taking all my business elsewhere and hope everyone who reads this will strongly consider the same.

58,"February 21, 2012","The buying of the car was a reasonably pleasant experience and I thoroughly enjoyed my car for the 6 months that I had it. However, my car was totaled recently by a truck and working with the dealership has since become a total nightmare. 

I needed to cancel my extended warranty in order to activate my GAP insurance. However to this, I needed to send in forms to the dealership that they would pass on to the company servicing the extended warranty. First they wasted my time by absolutely requiring I go into the dealership in person to fill out the forms (hard to do without a car and when one is in an entirely different city) and when I was able to conjure up transportation to the dealership, they didn't tell me that I would need to bring with me other forms and paperwork to even begin the process. It was a complete waste of time and money and nothing was accomplished. Finally they admitted that I could have easily filled out the one form they needed and sent in the remainder all via email. I did so promptly. Weeks have passed and I have since found out that the dealership has yet to send in the paperwork I gave them, leaving me at square one. I called to find out what was going on and was given excuses and blame-shifting. They refused - REFUSED - to give me the name and phone number of the person in their business center that could actually help me. Andy (the man who told me I had to go in to the dealership in person and then didn't send in my paperwork) had the nerve to tell me point blank he ""[didn't] care"" about the position that I was in and how the dealership was responsible for putting me in that position. I tried to go over Andy by talking to the managers. Needless to say that neither the Financing Manager nor the General Manager of the entire dealership answer their phones or return my calls. Over a month later, I am still waiting on the dealership to do its job and cancel my warranty. 

In short they are pleasant and helpful for only the amount of time it takes to get you to buy a car, but after that they are inconsiderate, rude, apathetic, unhelpful, and will not give you the time of day. ",2.4

Al & Jacob and Rick all came over to me as I was looking over the excellent work they did and I thanked them all.  My car has 98,200 miles on it.

Everyone told me not to worry we will make this right for you and work to get you a new engine if it is real bad internally.

61,"July 11, 2011","This was the sceond car that I bought from Hollis Farley at Freedom Chevrolet.  I traded in the 2008 HHR-Super Sport that I bought from him in 2008.  Bought a 2011 Cruze LTZ.  Dealership had ample cars in inventory with differing levels of equipment and pricing as well as colors.  Took me longer to pick out the car than it did to do the deal.  Hollis does not play the usual car salesman games.  If you want to play games, go see someone else.  If you want to get a great deal with a minimum of time spent, then go see Hollis.  I was treated as a real person, not just another sale.",4.8
62,"September 25, 2010","I went to Freedom Chevrolet to trade in my Chevy Astro Van.  I was greeted by Hollis Farley who asked what i was looking for and a general price range.  He suggested looking at the Chevy HHR.  We looked at a few and test drove 3 HHR's.  This first was rather stripped and was just OK.  The second was a HHR panel van which had way too many blind spots for me.  Then we drove the HHR Super Sport.  I was hooked.  Very nicely equiped, quick and fun to drive with the turbocharged engine.  Hollis told me that he was positive that I would end up with the SS but that he wanted show me some lower priced options first.  We came to a price agreement, went through finance and was on my way in well under 3 hours total.

I would recommend that anybody looking for a new car or truck go to Freedom Chevrolet and ask for Hollis. None of the usual car dealer salesman BS.  Danny, the sales manager was also very nice to work with and very pleasant.",5.0
63,"June 10, 2010","“Heed my WARNING”. All I can say is “RUN THE OTHER WAY!!”  I just wanted to let those of you who may be looking to purchase a new or used vehicle from a reputable and trustworthy company, look elsewhere. This was absolutely the WORST car buying experience I have ever dealt with. We spent three hours haggling to get a reasonable deal, and had all come to an agreement on the terms and conditions. We were permitted to take the vehicle home for the evening to have our mechanic check it out. Thank you for that opportunity “Freedom Chevrolet”! After further inspection we discovered multiple issues and safety concerns with the vehicle. One of my big concerns was that the emergency, or parking brake did not work at all, and I live on a steep hill which requires the use of the brake for safety reasons. After returning the vehicle to them the following day and requesting that the repairs be made; because it would not be able to pass a Texas State Inspection in its current condition, we were told that everything would be taken care of at no additional cost. We proceeded to let Alexis Montez, our sales consultant, know that once all the repairs were made we were going to purchase the vehicle and we gave them one thousand dollars down to hold the vehicle. We went to our financial institution that evening to finalize the funding and purchase agreement. After waiting for the purchase agreement to be faxed over, and being told that it had been sent multiple times by Ms. Montez, we discovered that she had been lying and wasting our time. She had never sent it because, apparently after making the agreed-upon repairs they decided it had cost them too much money and were going to charge us an additional three thousand dollars on top of what we had agreed upon and gotten the loan for. After going around and around with them, and their total disregard for my fiancé’s safety by letting her take a vehicle off their lot with such hazardous issues; they told us they would not honor our agreement and would rather sell it to another individual that was willing to pay more. It is nice to see the Freedom Chevrolet and their GM, Mike Springs are more concerned with making a thousand dollars extra, than they are with customer SAFETY and SATISFACTION. So to reiterate, shop elsewhere and BOYCOTT Freedumb Chevrolet!!!",1.2
