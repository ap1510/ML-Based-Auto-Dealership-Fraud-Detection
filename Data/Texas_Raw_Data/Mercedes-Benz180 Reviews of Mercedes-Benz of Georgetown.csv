1,"March 22, 2020",I recently purchased a new GLE 350 at this dealership.  Linda was my sales consultant and she was great!  Very personable but professional.  She spent a lot of time with me and dealt with all my questions and indecision with patience and honesty.  Several other employees and Ali were vey diligent in addressing me and following up. Kristin was my finance manager and she was also a pleasure to work with. I'm very pleased with the overall experience and love my vehicle!,5.0
2,"December 31, 2018","I called ahead to pick up some accessory/ parts for my new vehicle, and was encouraged to come in bc they had them in stock instead of waiting for them to ship.  I drive out there and the dealership is an absolute mess due to their remodeling;  They really should have temporarily shut down or set up someone else because there is no one where to park and the lot is an absolute mess.   Despite calling ahead, my parts were not pulled and ready for my pick up AND, more importantly, I couldn't get anyone to help me at all.  I stood there for 20 minutes without as much as an acknowledgement;  Understandable if they were working with customers but these guys were shooting the breeze & gossiping with each other.  When I told a salesman on my way out that I was angry with the lack of customer service, he shrugged it off but it prompted no other response from him.  Thank you for showing me who you really are Mercedes of Georgetown, I know where I won't be spending even a penny of my money.  ",1.0

31,"November 08, 2017",It’s hard to find a dealership that makes you feel happy and satisfied. Sometimes dealership push it to the limit in maximizing the bill and not best interest of the customer.

44,"September 25, 2017",Brought my sprinter in the shop because of a check engine light. Could be worse timing as we will only a few days after hurricane Harvey hit the Texas coast and we were planning to help bring food and supplies to rockport.

48,"September 12, 2017","A concierge greets you and gets you signed in. My service manager, Jeff Geary, checked with me within a few minutes to confirm what needed to be done on the vehicle. Throughout my time there he kept me informed as to the status of service taking place and the timing for completion.

Amenities in the waiting area are excellent (coffee, soda, pastry, popcorn, etc..), although I was disappointed to see that newspaper subscriptions had been stopped, so no US Today or Austin Statesmen were available. I hope M-B management has not been overtaken by political correctness in response to a few (emphasis on ""few"") of their client's petty complaints that take offense to newspaper articles expressing views all along the political spectrum, from far left to far right. Customers and clients can always choose to exercise their right not to read the newspapers made available, and thus avoid having their tender sensitivities ruffled. Those who do enjoy reading up on current events while waiting for vehicle service completion miss this nice courtesy formerly extended by the management.

The staff in the service area are friendly, courteous, and professional in their treatment of their customers. They meet or exceed all reasonable expectations in this regard. My vehicle was serviced and returned to me in a timely manner, and the routine car wash is always an extra appreciated bonus. Keep up the good work!!",5.0

All of the employees we met at the dealership made us feel welcomed, that we mattered and where important and were serious about earning our business. There was no pressure to buy from this dealership even when we told them we were going to Houston to shop around other colors.  Once we decided on the color, & we knew that Georgetown had that same color, even if Houston gave us the same deal we would've drove back to Georgetown to buy the car from Anthony.

A service after purchase is very horrible. I cannot give more than 1 star. Before I purchase the vehicle I told my salesperson, Jacob, more than 10 times that they do not have the correct address in their system. I asked him to change the address to the correct one via email, text message, and in person at the dealership. I do not even know where they got that address. I receive the registration paper a week ago from Texas DMW. Again, there was wrong address on the paper. They registered my vehicle under the WRONG address.  

There is no response from the salesperson or the dealership. I do not think they are going to change the address. I called the dealership today to speak with a general manager and an operator does not want to tell me their general manager's or sales manager's email or contact number. She transferred me to their title office but it got disconnected even before I talk to a person.

164,"September 22, 2016","My wife entered the dealership last week looking for a new or used car to use for her business. She met Tom Worsham and immediately found him to be friendly, personable and very helpful. Tom suggested she look at a 2015 MG 550 that had recently been returned from a customer lease. She fell in love with it and called me to come in and join her for a test drive.  She also told me she was impressed with Tom. During the walk around inspection of the vehicle he had showed her a small scratch on the door of the car which she was not able to detect without his help.  His honesty and openness was both refreshing and reassuring to her. The vehicle was loaded with extras and the previous owner had provided it with immaculate care. While on the test drive Tom demonstrated his expertise and familiarity with all of the features of the vehicle and patiently answered dozens of questions. He also demonstrated his detailed knowledge of many of the operational features and capabilities offered by this particular vehicle, and explained their function in straightforward and easy to understand terms. Tom is definitely not the stereotype car salesman. He made both of us feel important and stayed closely attuned to our needs and desires. He is well mannered, courteous, kind, well-informed and a pleasure to be around. He played a major role in our decision to buy at MB Georgetown, by making our buying experience thoroughly enjoyable and satisfying.

We would also like to mention another MB Georgetown employee. Brant Wimpee steered us through the normal maze of contract documents associated with buying a car. This where you are also traditionally presented with a range of ""extra"" services and programs available for purchase. Brant clearly and concisely presented the full menu of offerings, explaining pros and cons of each. But refreshingly, there was no hard sell on any of these items. Since we were purchasing a ""used"" - albeit a luxury vehicle - for business use, we decided ourselves to add a maintenance package and an extended warranty program. There was plenty of flexibility in deciding on the duration and costs of the programs we decided to include. Brant was thorough, efficient and a delight to work with. When we decided to return the following week to revise some of our original signing documents to insure my wife was reflected as the primary owner, Brant was quick to accommodate us. His treatment of us demonstrated the same emphasis on customer service that Tom Worsham had shown us earlier.",5.0

167,"July 05, 2016","What a mess this dealership is – and the amount of employee turnover is mind-boggling
Last month I called to speak to Christal, the latest “Service Consultant” with whom I worked, and left a message on her voicemail. I wanted to speak to her to follow up on the last service visit as I kept receiving inaccurate “Know Your Vehicle” reports. About 40 minutes later I received an email from some guy named Adam Fontenot, confirming my appointment for the following Monday (a date, BTW, when I was going to be out of the country) which apparently was set up by my “Advisor”, Richard (another guy with whom I had never spoken). Within 6 minutes of the email I received a call from some very annoying woman at the dealership to confirm this appointment – the appointment I never made – clearly unbeknownst to her. She did not seem to have any idea what was happening and didn’t even know that I had not made the appointment. Then she involved some other woman who told me that Richard had told her to set up the appointment. She could not even explain why she had chosen the time and date or what was going to be done at this appointment.
I explained that I had actually called to speak to Christal and had simply left a message for her to call me. It was only then that I was told that, notwithstanding the fact that Christal’s voicemail was still active, “she left a while ago”. Richard is now the seventh Service Consultant (Ryan, Jeff, Nathan, Tony, Michael, Christal – and now apparently Richard) which I have had at this dealership in the last 29/30 months – the first six having left now. Even stranger is the fact that new management has started hiring back some of the people who left or were let go under previous management. One guy who I was told by the former Service Manager was fired for being “completely out of touch” (his words not mine) is back again. (As a point of reference I try to have the cars serviced at MB Houston North as often as possible. There everything works as it should and I have had the same Service Advisor for 8 years!)
During my last service visit to Mercedes Benz of Georgetown (MBG) there were all sorts of problems – to mention only a few: the mileage on the car listed was off by 2,000+ miles; the service report was a reprint of one from a former visit where most if not all of the items had since been taken care of during that penultimate service visit; and I was quoted one charge – in writing – for a transmission service and then charged a different amount (needless to say higher). When asked for my insurance card (for the loaner car) I requested that they make a copy of it and give it back to me as last time they lost the card – yes you guessed it they lost it again – and after 20 minutes finally found it in the new shop area. They also told me that I had 2 tires which had “dry rot” and needed replacement. I then asked for an up-to-date report to be emailed to me – and once again was just sent the old, inaccurate one. When I questioned it again I was told “we are working out the kinks in the system”.
The dry rot tires claim is an interesting one. I had the same tires checked by Discount Tires (DT) 2 days later and was told they could find no dry rot. Whilst the tires were coming up on time for replacement due to tread wear DT found no dry rot. The replacement costs for the EXACT same tires at DT was $470 (plus tax) compared to the $750.20 (plus tax) quoted by MBG. After the last two visits to MBG I came away with the distinct impression that there was a “push” on in the Service Department to sell tires as three other people in the waiting room were told their tires had dry rot. Out of nine people in the waiting area - 4 had tires with dry rot - what are the odds?
I don’t know if the new management needs even more time (they bought the place 9+ months ago) to work things out but clearly there is something very wrong here. The place is mass confusion and much of this is exacerbated by the silly procedures which the new management has installed. There are all sorts of people, mostly kids, standing around in the forecourt, doing virtually nothing. Once you finally get into the forecourt (as inexplicably there is a constant line of cars backed up outside) one has to check in with one of them and give them various bits of information. Then through the first of many breakdowns in communication at this place, one then must “check-in” at this silly little “Concierge” desk which has been plopped by the door and explain everything again. Once the “Concierge” cannot find your appointment (which in my experience is the norm) more confusion ensues. Finally, you meet with a “Service Advisor” who again has been given no information from the first 2 people. If you need a loaner you should add 25-30 minutes to the whole process. When it is time to collect your car this whole farce plays out again and don’t apply any logic at this point in the process either. If you go to the cashier’s counter to pay your bill you will be sent back to the “Concierge” to actually collect the invoice and other related paperwork – if your Advisor has remembered to close it out. If not, then all sorts of people go on an “Easter Egg Hunt” to try to find the paperwork to check you out. If you are lucky your car is not still in the car wash and you can then leave shortly thereafter.

Within minutes I got a call back from Jacob Steger who said he would be happy to show is the car. We went in that Saturday and after test driving the car, my wife was underwhelmed. Nothing against the vehicle, she was just used to driving a larger Saturn Outlook SUV and the GLK is a smaller vehicle in terms of being a crossover. Jacob didn't pressure us at all. He listened to our comments and waited for us to come up with the next move. I glanced across the parking lot and asked my wife if she liked any of the cars. After about 15 minutes while Jacob and I were walking the aisles I noticed my wife had glued herself to a 2014 Lunar Blue C250. It was well within out budget, CPO, low mileage and spotless for a two year old car. She was sold. Although it ALWAYS takes too long at any dealership, it wasn't too bad. Jacob was awesome. No hint of the typical high pressure cars salesperson. Financing was great, Brant Wimpee, the guy that took care of the paperwork (finance manager?) was funny and managed to carry on  a conversation with us while navigating through a mountain of paperwork.

After 3 hrs, we had agreed on a price, but when the sales lady went and talked to Rich Carlson (general sales manager)  he said he'd made a mistake on the car and that he could not sell that car at the price we'd agreed upon.  He later said that he would honor the price agreed upon.  When I came back the next day with cash in hand. the sales lady said the car just sold. All along she was telling me he didn't want to sell the car to me at that price. Rich Carlson is NOT a man of his word. A month later the car is still sitting on the lot.  My advise.. GO ELSEWHERE, and in reading most reviews, people have had a bad experience also.  If your looking for a dealership that honors what they say and want excellent sells and service,,, go to Lexus..

174,"January 08, 2013","Went in for an acceleration problem they fixed, but left a very loud noise.  Went back to get that fixed and they tried to charge me an additional $80.  I said I was told it was guaranteed and shouldn't have to pay more.  He said ok would get my car right away.  Took over 1/2 an hour to get my car.  20 minutes after leaving my brake wear light comes on.  I go back and say why does something different always go wrong with my car everytime I come here.  The Manager Eddie says give me an opportunity to fix the car and we won't charge you.  I leave my car there for the day and when I pick it up I notice it's driving like a boat swaying side to side accentuating every bump and sitting on an angle now half the time.  Draw your own conclusions!",1.8
175,"December 14, 2012","I have been using MB of Georgetown for over 6 yrs now and for all three of my MB vehicles.  I have never had a bad exsperience here, and they have the best parts and service department that I have ever worked with in over 25 yrs of dealing with car dealerships.  Even when I take in my ""classic"" 1994 model for even a simple service I am provided a loaner car for as long as necessary.  Eddie and Brandan are the best service advisors par-none, and the whole staff is courtesous and professional.  This is a dealership for life!",5.0
176,"July 19, 2012","I switched from MB of Austin to this location two services ago. And I must say, thus far, it's been the best decision I've made. Great service department at Mercedes of Georgetown. I've only worked with two Service members, however, both were excellent. Car was completed on time, washed, and the loaner cars are given no questions asked. Great job MB of Georgetown !",5.0
177,"April 04, 2011","I generally don't feel compelled to go online and write reviews but my experience at Georgetown Mercedes-Benz has me doing just that.  We purchased a certified pre-owned Mercedes and I can honestly say that the level of service and dedication we received from both Alan, the salesman and Rich, the finance manager was astounding.  Neither man was satisfied until we had the vehicle we wanted and with the terms we needed.  I cannot say enough good things about the whole experience, but will say that they have found themselves a definite repeat customer and that I'll be recommending them to everyone I know.",5.0
178,"November 02, 2009","I came to this dealership looking for a certified used car and initially found the staff to be very helpful. I found a car which was priced well and had all of the features I was looking for so I decided that I would make my purchase from this dealer. At first the sales person and management were great and were willing to offer me a great deal. After making the decision to buy from this dealer I applied for financing both through the dealer and from outside sources. This is the point when things took a huge turn for the worst. The dealer offered me a rate that was 3% higher than I was offered from the exact same lender when I applied on my own. When I told my salesperson this I was told that the manager would prefer to use their lender at the higher rate. When I said no to this and kindly asked for a refund of the deposit I paid I was told that the sales person had misunderstood his manager and that what the manager had said was that he could probably match the lower rate through his lender. 

On the day that we were supposed to be closing what should have been a simple sale I could still not get a direct answer from the staff. I was then informed by the very helpful and cheery sales person that there was no problem and that the next day we would complete the sale. When I called the next day I was once again greeted by the same salesperson sounding very apathetic and uninterested. I was told that they were unable to match the lower interest rate and that If I wanted to do the paperwork on this day we could but I would have to wait up to 3 weeks to get the car because by loan was in the form of a ""blank check"" which is pre approved and completed by the dealer. Keep in mind that the lender was the same for both loans, only the interest rate was different, and furthermore, the dealership is listed on the lenders website as an approved participant in this program. I was being told basically to accept a much higher interest rate or shop elsewhere which is what I did. I kindly asked for my deposit to be refunded and went on my way. I find it very hard to understand why this dealership would pass on a guaranteed sale with approved financing from the same lender they use,and 20% down payment but I do know that I will not be shopping with them in the future. I found the same model of car in the exact color I wanted, with lower miles, the same options and for less money at another dealer who was more than happy to take my money. Their loss I suppose.",2.0
179,"July 28, 2005","I want people to know that I found a great dealer but better than that I found an exceptional, professional sales person who went above and beyond the call of duty to make my buying experience the most pleasure I have ever had when purchasing a car. Alan was receptive to our needs, he answered all of our questions and did not give us the usual run arounds. I would recommend him to all of my friends. He most of all showed me that he stood behind his word. After my purchase I have called him for small things and he stops what ever he is doing and  resolve my issues.
I know that when we are ready to buy our next car there is no doubt who we will buy from.",5.0
