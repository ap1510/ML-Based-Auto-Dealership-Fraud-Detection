0,"February 24, 2016","I recently found myself in need of a new car with very specific requirements and a very specific budget. The staff at Truck Town Dodge were so helpful throughout the whole process, offering advice and working with me to get a car that suited my needs. Trey was very informative and positive while he showed me different cars on the lot and explained the features to me. Jared worked with me for hours, going above and beyond to find a car that was right for me. He found a perfect fit on another lot, but despite the distance, I drove it home the very next day! Toby, the general manager was very supportive of my situation and walked me through anything I didn’t understand. The finance manager, Chad, helped me get a great interest rate and walked me through all the paperwork I needed to complete. The whole experience was amazing – I trust this team to get me exactly what I need without all the sleazy underhanded techniques you see at other dealerships. This was so much less stressful than my last car-buying experience, and I dare say it was even pleasant! Thanks Truck Town staff; I would highly recommend this place to anyone!",5.0
1,"August 16, 2015","I just purchased a 2015 JEEP Wrangler Unlimited from Truck Town in Lamesa, the whole deal was done over the phone with Gabriel. Gabe did everything he could to make sure he could get me in a vehicle (that I  wanted) I went in 2 days later took about 10 minutes to do paperwork and I was driving back to Odessa. Thank you Truck Town and Gabe for a GREAT car buying experience.",5.0
