0,"June 20, 2020",I had a very bad experience with another Volvo dealership. From the first time I spoke with Demetrius he made me feel comfortable and there was no pressure sailing. D and Gary were so professional & very knowledgeable.  They made our buying experience easy and painless. I highly recommend this dealership even if you have to drive across town. You won’t regret it. I wish I would have gone to DeMontrond Volvo first. ,5.0

2,"June 11, 2019","Chris Trapani at DeMontrond Volvo was very helpful. He took extensive time to educate me regarding the various models, demonstrated great patience while I test drove several times, spent lots of time showing how to use all the features after our purchase, and is always readily available to answer further questions. I highly recommend Chris and DeMontrond Volvo. ",5.0
3,"May 20, 2019","I recieved  excellent  service  from  Charlie  Nelson.  As I live  in Dallas  all  negotiations were done  via email  and phone
Charlie  was quick to respond  ,very knowledgeable,  and very patient. 
When  I arrived  to pickup my car. The sales manager  ,finance manager and tech support  were prompt and extremely  helpful. My car was waiting  on  the  showroom  floor fully  detailed.  I was in and  out  in less than an hour. Most of the time was spent going over the tech options. 
Wonderful  experience.",4.6
4,"May 19, 2019","Working with Adrian and Demetrious on a transaction was an absolutely pleasure. I was impressed with how flexible Adrian was in terms of my schedule, responsiveness over the phone, and going through the process in a bit of an unconventional order at my request.  He was able to establish good will from the beginning and made me feel comfortable throughout the process answering all my questions (I had a lot) and concerns in detail and in an open and transparent manner. Happy I was able to strike a deal with these gentlemen and I’m certainly happy with the outcome and vehicle. Highly recommend Demontrond and Adrian and will certainly be paying these guys a visit in the future!",5.0

They will do their best to take your money and leave something unfinished hoping that you will come back !!",1.2
6,"February 06, 2018",Mary Broussard in the service department has always been very professional and friendly.  Everyone there makes you feel at home.  I've been satisfied customer for as long as I've owned my car.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     ,5.0
7,"May 01, 2017","I took my vehicle to get serviced here because I feel a slight jerk when I drive it.  I explained the issue to two different services managers there. both of them told me that they felt the jerk but they don't know what it is.  They run a software check on my vehicle and still can not tell me what the issues is. I feel that it is very weird that an authorized dealerships with trained mechanics can not tell me what is wrong with my car. They sent home  both times without telling me what is wrong with my car.  I was given the cold shoulder as if I was making this issue up. . Chris, the manager told me at my second visit, told me that if I had any concerns that I could him anytime. We made arrangements and he did ride with me in my vehicle to see he if could notice the issue I had. He admit that he felt ""something"". He suggested a some kind of system. I was informed by by him the test did not show what was the issue. It was left as that. No other suggestions or concern. His efforts were not any more concerned with my issue. I will end it there before I say something really ugly.",1.4

I decided to trade in my current car the weekend after Christmas for a new C30 at this dealership. The saleperson was great, but that's about where it ended. Since I've had the car, the passenger airbag light shows that the airbag is not on sometimes when passengers sit there. The first time I was told nothing was wrong with it, but it surfaced again. At the same time I noticed an oil leak in my garage. 

The car has 500 miles on it, and I wish I had the one with 85,000 that I traded in. This time, they told me that the airbag issue was a software upgrade problem (not sure why they didn't do this before delivering to me or last time it was in). I was told the oil was leaking from the oil cooling unit, so they replaced that yesterday. Result- still leaking. Their mistake, it was really the turbo drain plug needed to be tightened. 

Long story short, I've had my new car in my possession 8 out of 21 days, and it's still in the shop. I'm finding the technical expertise lacking, and I don't recommend Demontrond Volvo for sales or service currently. This twice before going here.
