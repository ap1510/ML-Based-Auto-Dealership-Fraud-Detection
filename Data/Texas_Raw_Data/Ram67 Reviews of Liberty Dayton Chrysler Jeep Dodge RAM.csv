28,"May 07, 2020","The individuals I deal with are very helpful and kind. But, I don‚Äôt understand why it has taken 4 months to replace my remote fob for my 2019 Dodge Ram 2500. I have been doing business with this dealership for 20 years and have purchased 4 trucks during that time. I purchased the extended warranty for this truck and the remote fob was lost. The warranty covers the cost. I know for a fact that there are two fobs per new truck  on that parking lot. Why can‚Äôt you give me one of them and replace it with The one that has been on order for the last 4 months. Your actions with this subject determines  my future business with this dealership. This is not a threat, it‚Äôs just a fact. Im wishing to do another 20 years business with your dealership. Thank you, Daniel Thomas",5.0

58,"June 18, 2019","When other dealers failed to understand my need... When other dealers failed to get right on my trade... When other dealers tried to scale back and give less but still ask more. 
When other dealers (LARGER DEALERS) who boast about being # 1 in customer service but forgot to call the customer back or listen to what you need.... 
Then you NEED Liberty Dayton Chrysler and Cameron... You know what you need them from the start! 
I work long hours six to seven days a week and really didn‚Äôt have time to take an ENTIRE day off and deal with the nightmare of sitting all day at a dealership. I tried 5, yes FIVE other dealers in the Beaumont and surrounding areas before someone connected me with the owner of LDC... I spoke, to the OWNER for nearly 1/2 hour about a host of things before we hung up the phone. He assured me that he would put his best man on the job and he did just that! Cameron called me that afternoon got details of my situation and used that information to pick the PERFECT Ram for me. I mean exactly what I had in mind. From a phone call y‚Äôall!!! 
They did what five others claimed was impossible! 
I arrived early (technically before normal business hours) the next business day and observed a man shining up my dream truck. That man wasn‚Äôt a porter, it was Cameron! He trained me on ALL the features of my 2019 Ram. I was so well informed that I just finished training a friend in Baton Rouge who purchased his Ram weeks ago and still trying to figure it all out. 
Folks. You WILL NOT go wrong if you take the drive out to Liberty for your next vehicle! 
The customer service is real and not just an ad slogan with them. 
If you buy anywhere else you payed too much and wasn‚Äôt treated like you deserve to be. 
This has been the BEST vehicle purchasing experience of my life! 
OUTSTANDING!!! 10 ??",5.0
59,"December 05, 2018","I am so sad and depressed about my experience with this dealership. I am left feeling so played and defeated because I am a women and now the service manager is being so rude. My car ran hot on my on Nov 6 I decided to bring my car to my local Dodge to make sure the repairs would be do properly especially because I have a 5.7L. I soo regret this decision now. Brandi the service advisor keep me up to date with information and I wrote down everything she told me every time she called. First I was told I needed a new radiator which I expected and that was going to cost my about 1200 dollars and I agreed to it. Then the next day she called me and said that coolant was leaking into my 3rd cylinder and it would be 600 dollars to diagnosis because of the labor. I agreed to that as well. Then she called me and said that I need a right and left head gasket, new value covers, and spark plug seals. I wrote all this down.I still have the paper!! She said it would be 2625 dollars. Anyways I reluctantly agreed to the repair because I still have a loan on this car and I would be upside down on a trade in. I should have known something was suspicious when my car was ready the same day after a head gasket repair.  I am a nurse by trade so I don't know any thing about cars but when I google a head gasket repair it usually take 3 or more days. But I still picked my car up only to find out that its still broke. The coolant is boiling in the radiator reservoir.  I took it right back. They said that it was a thermostat problem and they fixed the thermostat for free. 2 days later the same thing, coolant boiling but now my check engine light is on with code P0303 which is a misfire in cylinder 3. The same cylinder that was leaking coolant into it! So I go back to the dealership and the service manager is saying that not only did they never change my head gaskets they also never said that I had coolant leaking into my 3rd cylinder.  I'm no looking over my receipts and I don't know what to make of all this. I had to take out loans to get this repair done and now I don't have money to do anything else. I am a single mother of 3 kids and its the holidays. This just sucks. Don't bring you car here. Don't buy Dodge period.",1.0
60,"January 17, 2017",I brought my Dodge 2500 in for a recall. Everyone was very friendly and professional. To my surprise I got my truck back in the same day. I would recommend this dealership to anyone who needs service work done. üòÅ,5.0
61,"June 27, 2015","Looked up car on the Internet, found what I wanted.  Went to dealership, car was still on lot.  Had trouble with my finance company, so dealership held my car till I could get it straightend out. Lucille was great she explained everything to a T.  Papa even did a grat job detailing my car before I came to pick it up.",5.0
62,"April 15, 2015","Over Easter weekend my 2014 Avenger started to develop a major oil leak (due to a third party oil change breaking something).  The service department was very pleasant to deal with.  They were able to determine what was wrong and get it fixed in just 1 day.  I then asked them to look at something 2 other dealerships (including the one I bought it from) had said nothing could be done(severe road noise coming in from the driver side door seal).  They found the issue and replaced the gaskets on the door.  This took an extra day, but was well worth it.  When it was all said and done, I was out nothing (as covered by warranty), and have a great experience with them.  If that is an example of their service, I will drive an hour to deal with them compared to the 3 dealerships I live near.  The closest one to me is a NIGHTMARE and I would never go to due to extremely poor customer service!

63,"February 04, 2014",Worst service department in America. Brought my truck specifically for rear end work. A week later I get a call about an exhaust leak and brakes needed. They hadn't even looked at the rear end yet. Wouldn't call me and update me and wanted to $2000 for the work and $700 not to do the work. They are literally thieves. Special place in xxxx for these clowns.,1.0
64,"November 09, 2012","I ordered a new vehicle from liberty dayton dodge, waited 6 weeks for it to come in. when it arrived I traded in my truck and was asked to leave a programmer in my old truck for a few days then I could come and pick it up. As I arrived to pick up my personal property I was told it was missing , and they were not sure it was ever even there. Being that the car salesmen ( Cameron) saw it in the truck. I asked what happend. They said it just dissapeared and i was out $500 and there was nothing i could do about it. The man that owns 75% of the company didnt even have the courage to answer the phone. You would figure after spending 45K on a truck they would treat you with respect, but I guessed wrong. Never again well me nor anyone in my family give these worthless pigs a penny out of pocket.",1.6
65,"March 24, 2012",This was the most knowledgeable and friendly staff.  The whole process from beginning to end was pleasant.  Would definitely recommend a friend and return for my next car purchase.,5.0
66,"March 20, 2012",Came in and told Dustin what I wanted and within minutes he had the car that I was looking for pulled up to the door. After the test drive Dustin and Mike worked to get me THAT car at a payment that worked for me.  If you are looking for a new car then go see this guy.,5.0
