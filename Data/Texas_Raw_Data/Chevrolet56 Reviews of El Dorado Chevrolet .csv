0,"May 13, 2020","My husband and I have a 2018 Chevy Traverse that we bought from ElDorado Chevy
recently had an issue with an exhaust pipe. In the beginning thought that we were going to have to pay for it but ended up being an issue that the plant caused so the dealership took care of it. 
It's so important to have a dealership that you can trust to make sure you're safe on the road 

Thanks guys for taking such great care of us and our baby!!!!",5.0
1,"January 07, 2020","I had zero issues while working with this dealership from my sales guy (Bradley) to the Manager to the finance department. No one that I worked with was rude or pushy at all and they got me out of there in under 1.5 hours which I appreciated greatly having an 18 month old with me. I can not speak to the warranty issues some other people have had here as I have not had an issue arise where I needed work done but everything I have experienced so far has been far above experiences I have had elsewhere. Thanks to everyone who worked on my deal, we are loving our truck!",5.0
2,"May 04, 2019","“Technicians” in service dept are nothing more than parts changers, service wrters and managers are nothing more than thieves. Repair cost over $3300 and they didn’t fix the problem. Then I was told it would be another $1200 to fix their screw up. Service manager refused to make good. They belong in jail",1.0
3,"March 03, 2019","We bought a used truck from El Dorado and less than 30 days we found numerous problems and even though WE BOUGHT EXTENDED WARRANTY, they wouldn’t fix it . Drove hr n half AFTER they told us they would take care of it and then refused service unless we paid for it. THEY DO NOT HONOR THEIR WORD OR PRODUCTS .. Kept 2 days and drove 55 at tops on way home.RUDE RUDE RUDE USED CAR MANAGER and entire personal treated husband poorly when he went to pick truck up and won’t return calls . WONT BE BACK and attorney is working on problem !! ",1.0
4,"February 12, 2019",Was looking around many dealers for a specific vehicle and came a cross one here at this dealership. Sales person was Dominic and he was very helpful in answering my questions about the Traverse I was looking at. I feel I paid a little more than what their truck was worth but what made up for it was they gave me more than fair value on my trade. The Finance person was a pleasure to work with and my rate very close to what i was looking for. Overall experience was good with all staff I came across.  ,3.8
5,"February 08, 2019","I have 2013 ram 2500 diesel that I bought from Eldorado used. It had around 70,000 miles on it . It was still covered under factory warranty when bought. When the finance manager done the paperwork up he also put gap coverage on it for 750.00 and told me that he also put a 36 month 100,000 mile extended warranty on it for another 2750.00, and he told me the warranty would be good for up to 170,000 miles. I specifically asked. I xxxx sure would not have paid 2750.00 for a warranty up to 100,000 that I already had. When I took it to the dodge dealer to have recalls fixed this week I also had them fix a headlight that was shorted out. I told them it was still under warranty, when the called about it they said no both warranty’s had expired at 100,000 miles. I went to the dealership yesterday and the finance manager wouldn’t talk to me. He sent a underling out to talk to me and he didn’t do anything but xxxx me off. They are outright stealing from folks. I bought my last 2 trucks there but will never buy anything else there.",1.0
6,"January 24, 2019",Purchased truck on dec 17. Was late and they had to get ready and tint windows. Was suppose to pick up next day. Apparently it takes more than a day to tint windows and get new truck ready for delivery because it wasn’t ready. Said they would deliver to me by noon the next day dec 19. Delivered around 4 in afternoon. Would have been fine but looked at truck and noticed small scratches on hood and fender. Then noticed a big blob of something sticky on top of right fender. Then found corners of window sticker still inside window. Then found some kind of something on each wheel by valve stem. Then noticed window molding damaged on drivers door. Called salesperson and arranged to go ahead and drive truck that night and drop off next day to get fixed. Was told would be ready after six. Went to pick up and it was ready but marks still on wheels and truck wasn’t very clean. I understand it is black and shows everything but after they had 3 days it should have been spotless. Complained to manager and he offered 2 $25 gift cards and tank of gas. I accepted and left with truck. Truck should have never been delivered in that condition. Went to pick up tags and get gas on Jan 17. Lady handed me my tags and got someone to fill tank. Although I am plenty capable of putting on license plates myself it would seem that they would at least offer to put on for you. Got home and filled out reviews for Chevrolet and Eldorado. Got email from Jo Bailey at Eldorado saying customer satisfaction is of utmost importance and to please call. I called and no answer. Left message to return call. Never heard from Jo Bailey. Also I have emailed and got no response. Have wrote other reviews and stated was unable to get in touch with Jo Bailey. Proof they dont read reviews because response was the same. To please contact Jo Bailey.Well i have done my part to contact Jo Bailey. They have any info they need to contact me and have made no effort ..Also there were several questions on Chevrolet’s survey asking if they did certain things that they should have and they didn’t. One being Chevrolet rewards program. Didn’t know anything about it and still wouldn’t if it wasn’t for Chevrolet survey.  STAY AWAY FROM ELDORADO CHEVROLET!!!!!!,1.4
7,"January 02, 2019","this van was leaking in the rear before I purchased it service department said they fixed this before I drove off the car lot. But that’s a lie.  second time it was up in that service department for a week and it did not get fixed the second time.

8,"December 22, 2018","In 2017 I purchased a work van brand new, it had some issues leaking water, seatbelt was not working and engine ran rough. I had it in for over a week last year to get these issues fixed but this dealership could not get to it they could not even get the tires rotated.  So I went and started giving bad reviews and the owner contacted me and set another appointment to get stuff fixed. But when I showed up there was another young guy that got very amotional and turned me away. Why would that go to the effort to do the right thing. ",1.0

13,"May 16, 2018","worst car buying experience i ever had, no service after the sale and deceptive business practices especially in the finance department, this place needs to be investigated by Chevy and the authorities. RUN AWAY. CERTAIN EMPLOYEES THERE ARENT ALLOWED TO TALK TO CUSTOMERS!1 BIG RED FLAG!",2.0
14,"May 03, 2018","I have been to this dealership several times in recent months.  The front line sales guys are, with the exception of Joseph, just OK at best.  Joseph took great care of me.  Unfortunately, the problem is not with the salespeople - it's with their boss, Rusty.  After looking at various cars and deciding on a model, we were handed off to Rusty to talk prices.  He specializes in the high-pressure psychology sales tactics.  Rusty fed me wonderful gems like...

     ""I'm only going to give you my best price if you tell me you're going to buy a car today.""  

     ""What's it going to take for you to make a deal today?""  

     ""We have a 'No No's' policy here at El Dorado.""

     ""If you leave [to research other cars], that tells me you really don't want this car.""

     ""As long as you're in my dealership, I'm going to work as hard as I can to get you to buy.""

I finally told him to stop talking because I was going to leave.  He handed me off to another sales man and I left soon thereafter.

My next stop was at Hyundai of McKinney - a refreshingly great dealership.  I ended up buying a Hyundai from them a few days later - with absolutely no high-pressure sales tactics.  You can read my review about how great my experience there was.  Hyundai of McKinney is AWESOME!

As a footnote, I should mention that I've had my previous Chevys serviced by El Dorado Chevy.  They do a nice job and I have no complaints about their service department.  My complaint is solely with the new car sales team - specifically with Rusty.",1.3
15,"April 13, 2018","PSA:: If anyone is looking at buying a car, I would NOT recommend Eldorado Chevy in McKinney. I don’t like to call businesses out, but what I have experienced there this week is nothing short of illegal. We suffered a hard pull on our credit to get the paperwork lined up and when we got there was given a car that was DIFFERENT than the one we had been negotiating on. Same model but was very dirty and had 400+ miles on it. Wasn’t told until we were minutes from signing. I’m appalled and feel totally shell shocked after the week I’ve had there.. scummy negotiation tactics, bait and switch type approach to selling cars. The manager had to call my husband to try to “smooth things over” (after he had been condescending to us and laughed about the situation in front of us) so we wouldn’t take legal action— which we still might. If you value your time or sanity, stay away from this place. ",1.0
16,"April 05, 2018"," I would recommend this dealership to anybody and everybody my daughter and I experienced such excellent service they really went above and beyond for her first time buyers experience we encountered great customer service from beginning to end our consultant Jerome  Johnson  was the best , he really took care of us ...again wonderful customer service from all involved and very friendly  ??????????",5.0

Both memory and my thinking has taking it's toll.  they gave me amost 8,000 in rebates and took my truck 10,000$ and made me think I was getting the deal of s life time because I'm a Disabled veteran. And stupid Mr they stole my truck and took the rebates back and gave me a truck at MSRP cost all the time I thought I was getting a deal. And an outrageous payment thx eldorado. It took a week to get my manuels lol",1.4

20,"November 06, 2017","Overall it was a good experience considering going to a dealer is like going to the dentist.
We told them we were approved with Wells Fargo and they said fine. Then a couple weeks later the letters started arriving in the mail saying “we didn’t finance you this time but keep us in mind”... SIX DIFFERENT LENDERS !!
Why would they do that to us? Now we have all these hard inquiries that wont be off till 2019.
Thanks alot !! ",2.8
21,"September 14, 2017","I took my 2014 ford taurus in to fix the Electric heated/cooling seats, get new tires and car completely detailed. They had to order the tires but I knew the would because no one keeps the size in stock. And when they couldn't find what was wrong with the seats they took it to a guy that  specializes in the seats. When I got my car back three weeks after I dropped it off it  sparkled inside and out. I loved how They called me every step of the way to tell me what was happening with my car. I will totally go back again!!!",5.0

23,"August 26, 2017","Brought my Chevy truck in for repair due to check engine light on issue, a few days later the check engine light came back on again. Had to bring it in multiple times. 

Expensive! For example, a $30 part and 5 minute labor, the quote was over $500.

24,"August 17, 2017","I wish I would have seen this rating before I went here. I probably still would have gone, but I would have been more cautious.

3-Weeks ago, I purchased a cash car (2006 Volkswagen Jetta). Test drive went great, and paid cash for car. I also (luckily) took out a warranty through AUL ($600) for 2-years. 

Car broke down before I got home. Seems transmission was bad, and didn't show until driven over 20-miles (test drive was probably 10). Ahhh, but I have a warranty, or so I thought.

Car is now repaired ($1496), but they won't release until they get funds from AUL (warranty company). AUL won't release funds until they receive paperwork from El Dorado. El Dorado seems to be dragging their feet, as it has been 3-weeks, and they were going to ""overnight"" the paperwork (that was 2 days ago).

Sales manager said I could trade car back in if that would make things right. :-/ ???  I just got it fixed, why would I want to trade it back in?? So now, I wait for Eldorado to do their job. AARRgghhh

But, like I said before, I would have gone there anyway, so...
""IF"" you buy a used car and IF you take out the warranty, be sure they send paperwork in at that moment. BTW, there is a 600 mile minimum on the warranty, in other words, if the car breaks down in the first 600 miles, you get to go through this hassle.  Buyers be warned.",3.0
25,"August 17, 2017","We had a great experience with Ruben as our sales person.  He was never pushy, gave us a great deal and was a good experience all around.  I would suggest giving Ruben a call.  ",5.0
26,"June 01, 2017","I purchased a pre-owned vehicle from Jacob Self and it was a very pleasant experience.  He was very easy to work with and not pushy, which is my favorite way of buying anything.  Justin Griffin was very professional and friendly, helping to resolve a small hiccup without hesitation.  ",5.0
27,"May 20, 2017","I live 9 hours from the dealership and I contacted Dominic to purchase a vehicle, we agreed to the purchase price of $30K  and repairs of prior hail damage.  I agreed to purchase the car then I called them and made a $1,000.00 dollar non-refundable deposit and was instructed to go online and do my online financing. Which I did, they ran my credit which is excellent. I thought the car was mine. I received a call from Justin the sales manager saying that the deal we had agreed upon was being retracted and requested an additional $5K for a total of $35K  as anyone would do I told him we already had  a deal he was very rude and told me we had no deal. If I still want the vehicle I needed to pay $35,000.00. I declined the offer as anyone would after already agreeing to $30K. Then I could not get a returning phone call back from any of the general sales managers that I had left messages for. Would not recommend to anyone to purchase a vehicle.  Thank you for your time.",1.0
28,"February 24, 2017","Charged my 19 yr old who is a single mother and student over $2000 to fix an oil leak.  Told us the estimate Monday late afternoon, we called Tuesday morning at 7:30am and told them NOT to fix it and they told us that they had already fixed it.  They told me there was 17 hours labor ($200 part, and the rest is labor)....so from Monday evening till Tuesday morning, 17 hours labor!!!????  I don't think so.  
The Sales Manager was very rude and compared the ""exorbitant"" price of car repair to my job in the medical field.  Comparing apples to oranges, and besides that, why are we even discussing my job, what about the $2400 to fix an oil leak????  I will spend the rest of my days telling everyone I know not to go to this horrible dealership/service department where they fix issues without your permission, overcharge by thousands and treat customers like crap.  Oh, and the best part, the service manger tells me the work is guaranteed for a year, so I ask for something in writing and he laughs and says ""that's a new one!  No one ever asks for that!"" I say ""Really, you have a guarantee, but you're not willing to put it in writing.  This place is so trustworthy, that I'm sure a written guarantee is not needed! (SARCASM)""

29,"January 29, 2017","I purchased my first vehicle from Eldorado December of last year.  I was amazed at the coutious, professional and helpful staff!

30,"January 20, 2017"," I took my car in to get a check engine light diagnosed after my mechanic could not figure it out.  They told me it was a bad fuel pump and were going to charge twice as much as my mechanic.  So I pay my $120 diagnosis fee and take it to my mechanic to do the work.  Light still comes on and the dealership wants me to pay another $120 for another diagnosis.  So I paid $120 for the wrong diagnosis and over $500 for a fuel pump and my cel is still coming on.  Needless to say, they will not get any more of my business.",1.2
31,"November 18, 2016","Do not take your vehicle here unless you absolutely have to.  Not only are they dude but they're the slowest I've ever encountered. Their ""service"" advisors are completely clueless, maybe if they had less of them and more actual mechanics they'd actually get something done in good time. HORRIBLE ! And unless it's under warranty you'll pay double ",1.4
32,"October 12, 2016","
Took my 2500HD in to their body shop for 7k in hail repair. It took 3 months to get an appointment due to a backlog which was understandable. When I dropped it off I ask if they were still on schedule and they said they were and it would be out in a week. 28 days later it was still in the shop and my other truck had a check engine light come on. So I spent $600 to go down and pick up a rental for the week and took my 1500 into Eldorado Service Department. Along the check engine light I also ask them to check out the shocks, brakes, battery, belt, and change all the fluids. Oscar from the service department calls next day and says its the throttle body and needs new shocks. Oscar said the throttle body was 6-7 hundred and shocks about 4-6 hundred, brakes 400. With the other things I asked for the total bill was going to be 2k to 2,500. I told Oscar that sounded great to get it fixed. When I went to pick up the 1500 4 days later I fell out when the bill said 4,500. Over 2k more than he quoted me. In looking at that bill the throttle body was close to 1200 and they added plugs, wires, and a reprogram fee. Then the 600 set of shocks he sold ended up at 1342 with struts. Brakes were also couple hundred over quote. Oscar was their and I questioned him on what the xxxx was going on. He looked at me and couldn't speak because he didn't have an answer because he knew that he never quoted me anything close to that. I then threw the money down and left before things got ugly and I couldn't control myself over ridden with anger. After I leave the service bay I start calling all my buddies with toys because we all use the same places for our buisnesses and services. One of them says ""Hey I know a Mr. Gibbs the big wig up there."" So he sends him a text and I hear NOTHING. So by choosing Eldorado Chevrolet incompetent services it has cost me over 2,600. I have used this company for over 20 years and bought over 10 cars here along with using the service department and paying them over 10k a year. This year alone between my fleet and personal cars I have spent 22k in service department and body shop. I have called every person I know and told them to STOP dealing with them on every level. They just lost the sale of 7 2500HD fleet trucks from a friend of mine and 2 more I have hail damage on. By the time in done I will cost this company a million in business in my lifetime for dishonest service. After scrolling through all these reviews online I should have not been dealing with them in the first place. I have never seen such unhappy customers in all my life. Looks like they need to find better services advisors and a new service manager. DO NOT make the same mistakes I have made and take your car somewhere else you will be glad you did. I will also be contacting GM directly as well as the BBB.",2.2
33,"August 22, 2016","I was contacted by Steve Miller the Sales guy via email, I wanted to be straight forward with him before coming to his dealership.  I emailed Steve exactly what I was looking for, as they ALL do he said come in and I will help you out.  He was nice enough to come in on his day off as we had an appt @ 6pm, after he arrived after 6pm he took in another client, at 635 my fiance and I sat down in his office to start the spiel of this is how banks work, they like trade ins (which I already had explained I did not have), they like money down (which I already had explained that I did not have one).  So my fiance calmly asked Steve to get to the point, is she getting the car of not (seeing that we had been emailing back and forth )  Steve the Car Sales guy...said "" I DONT LIKE YOUR TONE YOU CAN LEAVE!""  Uh seriously, I was stunned to say the least.  My fiance was stunned as well, but I had been talking to this guy for two days and really wanted to leave with a car so I excused his behavior, just for him to turn around and say "" I SAID YOU COULD LEAVE""  Dont have to tell me twice, we left...did I mention we sat down at 6:35 and we were on the road leaving at 6:46!

36,"April 06, 2016","After arriving on time for a scheduled oil change and tire rotation, I checked in with Oscar in the service department.  He entered me in the system and I headed to the waiting room.  One hour and 15 minutes later, I notice my car has yet to be moved from just outside the drive-in service bay.  After approaching Oscar and asking why my car had not been worked on yet.  He made a call then proceeded to question me about the car actually being my vehicle.  I walked outside (alone) and checked, it was my car!  Upon further questioning, Oscar became argumentative and told me it would be at least another hour before my car was ready.  At this point I asked for my car and walked outside.  Suddenly a service manager appeared and he took my car back that instant.  It was done within 15 minutes.  No car wash though.  Apparently the dealership only does hand washes.  ??  Never been a problem at other dealerships.  
Later that afternoon I called Jo Bailey, the Customer Experience Manager, and explained my grievances.  It's been 48 hours and still no resolution.  I will never go to this dealership again.",1.0
37,"April 05, 2016",The worst new car sales purchase I ever experienced. I had to fire my salesman due to lack of communication and terrible customer service. After that I was pawned off to several sales people to help complete the sale. Very disorganized and poor management is what I experienced. If it wasn't due to that particular vehicle that caught my eye I would of taken my business else where.

The worst service department in the world!! My 2008 Tahoe has a lifter that has gone out related to TSB#PTP4568Q. The service department had the Tahoe for 5 hours to fix a basic flat and check the codes for the check engine light. Couldn't even check it in the back after 5 hours!! Had to check it on the service drive and told me that the codes showed 300 intermittent misfire and that I would have to bring it back to look at it in more detail. After several calls with Services Advisor, Anita, terrible follow up skills, BTW, she said that after a day in a half of figuring a quote that it would be $4800.00 to fix and GM would only pay 30% of the amount based on some ripoff by using a GM calculator. I asked her for a simple e-mail detailing the work that needed to be done and a day later no e-mailed quote. You would think if they wanted my business they would send a quote as easy as that!! Never taking my car to ElDorado Chevrolet Services again!! Lastly, GM has lost another loyal customer by not standing behind their engines. Known problem all over the Internet people are complaining. I have taken my Tahoe to ElDorado for Oil Changes, done all necessary maintenance and the engine only has $84,000 miles. I won't buy a GM vehicle again after this!",1.2
39,"December 21, 2015",Congrats to Eldorado Chevrolet for coming in at the last minute to be my worst buying experience of 2015 (which includes 3 other cars). If your service department worked as hard at trying to fix an issue as they do quoting Texas law then I'm sure they could have figured out cold fusion by now. I wouldn't let this place work on my pedal car.,1.8
40,"November 03, 2015","I bought a new Chevy Suburban LTZ on 2011 with extended coverage and polysteel protection for 6 years & 100K miles, which total cost me $1500 additional for both.  With a dashboard crack and some minor paint scratch when I visited them, they denied both by claims, showing some writings in the coverage book. Later In fact they were trying to prove me that I am wrong not reading their 30 page booklet at purchase. I could replace the dashboard issue  by another local dealer  after  calling Chevy head-office. The Polysteel coverage can be done using only from the dealer it purchased. 

Never fall on the trap of extended coverage and ploysteel from this dealer.

41,"September 22, 2015","I was very happy to be contacted by Gary Evans in regards to a new car purchase. I was initially hesitant to driving but Gary assured me that he would do what it took to earn my business. And he did. He paired me with New Car Salesman Taylor Chandler and it was an awesome experience. He was patient with my fiancé and I, took the time to help me find the vehicle that I wanted. His knowledge of the trucks helped make the decision that much easier and he was willing to earn my business rather than just expect it. He allowed me multiple test drives while I made a decision. I do not buy new vehicles usually, but the no-pressure experience made it an easier decision to make. It was an utter privilege working with him and I will be recommending him to all of my clients! 


I will be returning to El Dorado Chevy for future purchases and service!

44,"March 01, 2015",Do not buy a used vehical from this dealership they hide problems with the vehicals by resetti g the computer to turn off the check engine lights and just throw them on the lot for sale the morning after buying my 2009 dodge 2500 the check engin light came on and turns out they sold me a truck with a faulty emissions system so to save yourself the headache buy your vehicals at another dealership. I have tried to email mark welsh and the sales people and get no response from them. That tells me they knew about the problem all along so unless you dont want to sink another 2 grand into fixing what should have been fixed before the truck was put on the lot to be sold do not use this dealership.,1.0

But they made it so easy to locate the car we did want and had no problem transferring it. Our sales man was so helpful and very nice with even my little girls who had to wait as we negotiated.

This is my second new car to buy at Eldorado and it wont be my last, that's for sure.  I have referred 2 of my colleagues to your dealership because of my experience.   Thanks again.",5.0
48,"February 21, 2014","I was looking for a New Silverado 2500 HD Texas Edition and GM Marketing put me in contact with El Dorado Chevrolet. I worked out a price over the phone on the new truck and then drove 600 miles to McKinney, TX from Nashville, TN to buy my truck. The folks at El Dorado made the entire experience wonderful, even treating me any my family to lunch at a local Bar-b-q restaurant while we waited on some of the paper work. I now have moved to Ohio, but when the time comes, I may very well be making a road trip to McKinney Texas to see my friends at El Dorado Chevrolet. ",5.0
49,"January 03, 2014",The worst customer service and non informative person. Was told my car would be done in 3 hours called back after 3 hours and Pete rudely told me that my car wouldn't even be ready until next week. That it was on Friday and wasn't even sure when they would look at it. If he had told me that when I took it I would have taken it somewhere else. I picked up my car and he didn't even apologized or anything. Will tell all my friends about the rude attitude Pete has and to never go there again. I guess El Dorado Chevrolet doesn't care about their customers or for business if they have idiots like Pete working there!!,1.0
50,"December 18, 2013","We worked with Carl on the purchase of two Chevy Sparks.  He was extremely friendly, warm, patient, knowledgeable, and flexible.  We LOVE the the $$ we are saving on gas and this little Chevy is like a super hero on the ice.  It's a fun and comfortable little car and we are very happy.  ",5.0
51,"November 17, 2013","This is the first problem I have had with my vehicle. Chris was the solitary advisor on the Saturday I brought my car to the dealership. They still managed to remove the problem in less than an hour. I waited a week for a special order part and when it came in, it took less than an hour to install. ",4.8
52,"August 25, 2012", Super pressure to pay full sticker and high interest rates. Take a jar of Vaseline with you so it wont' hurt to bad. And be prepared for a berating if you don't squirm in their presence and give in to their ludicrous demands.,1.0
53,"August 02, 2012","We have had excellent sales and service since our first visit in 2006.
And plan to return anytime we need to purchase another vehicle or need service.
This dealership is outstanding in all respects.",5.0
54,"April 02, 2011",Great sales experience.  No pressure.  Just a knowledgeable and friendly salesperson.  Beautiful dealership.  Take the time to go out to McKinney when you're looking for a new car.  Ask for Daniel and you will enjoy the process.  El Dorado is family owned and that probably makes all the difference.,5.0
55,"February 28, 2011","My experience at Eldorado Chevrolet was great. We received a mailer with a pre-approval from a lender.  I faxed in all the pertinent information to the Dealership so they could get the finance process started.

 We went to the dealership late one evening to look at a few of the pre-owned vehicles that I had already seen online and was interested in.  We were approached by a salesman who immediately went to the finance department to find out exactly how much we were approved for.  He came back outside within minutes and gave us the number, then offered to appraise our trade.  This took them maybe 15 minutes.  They came back to us with a number that was just a couple hundred shy of KBB's ""Excellent"" condition, which is very unusual for dealerships to do.

We picked out a vehicle that worked with our finance deal, test drove it, filled out a little bit of paperwork and were out the door with the keys to the new vehicle within an hour.

Came back the next day to finalize paperwork in the finance office, which took about 30 minutes total.

Overall, our experience at Eldorado Chevrolet was excellent and I would definitely recommend them and plan to shop there again in the future.",5.0
