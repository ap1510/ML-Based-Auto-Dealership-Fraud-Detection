Lower range of our trade in was $27,000 but only wanted to give us $16,000 when we got there and vehicle is only a year old in great condition.  They then ignored our emails and phone calls.  Obviously don't care about repeat business.",1.0

2,"March 25, 2020","Traded our 2012 Ram in for a new 2020 Laramie, beautiful truck, however the service here is horrible!!!!  First time I have ever seen a dealer hand over the new vehicle and say ‚Äúoh, we didn‚Äôt have time to ‚Äúmake ready‚Äù wash!  typical rain residue  plus they had to change a tire but left all this white gooey stuff all over new tire.
Makes me mad every time I think about it.
Half the experience is driving out in a brand new sparking clean vehicle üò¢
Ok, I understand the quarantine during this time and maybe there wasn‚Äôt staff to wash it, but whoever changed tire could have cleaned up the mess.",1.0
3,"March 06, 2020","Took Jeep in several months ago to get gps serviced because it wasn‚Äôt working. I was told it was antenna problem and they needed to order one. No call back from them. Here we are several months later, I had to take Ram 3500 in because of transmission problem. They have no clue what‚Äôs goin on with it other than to say we need to take transmission out and see what‚Äôs wrong.  What?  No trouble shooting to narrow it down. So anyway I bought a new transmission on a Wednesday and they said it was in Dallas, TX and we will let you know as soon as it arrives and you will have truck back Friday. A week later I finally get truck back still no calls from dealership. Drove truck for half a day and transmission goes out again. I call to tell them they need to come get it with a tow truck. All they are concerned with is who is paying for the tow truck. Still no call back about truck arriving there or what‚Äôs going on. And still Jeep needs a new radio for gps to work which we still have no call back for it when it will arrive there  and the problem was not antenna.  No call back from service department or the managers I left my name and number to call me back with updates but they want to send me emails for reviews. I would not recommend ",1.0

I have needed some stuff done but I have had an extremely difficult time dealing with the service department, even after dealing with the service manager, my issues still has not been resolved. I have left numerous phone calls and emailed several times and still have not heard back or gotten my jeep taken care of.",2.0
5,"January 27, 2020","went to Tomball Dodge Chrysler Jeep on 1/11/2020 to trade my Jeep in for either a 19 Challenger or Charger.  This was to be the 4th vehicle purchase from them.  When my husband & I arrived, we were getting ready to test drive a 19 Challenger SXT, but when I started the engine the entire dashboard lit up! salesman told us to test drive an identical SXT (just a different color). Took the other for a test drive & liked it.  When we returned from the test drive, we saw the original SXT pulled into the express lane area. salesman assured us ""everything's good, which one you want?"". I told him that as long as everything was fine with the original one - that's the one I wanted (I liked the color and the windows were already tinted).  After signing the paperwork, husband & I left to head home. I was changing lanes when the steering wheel locked for a few seconds.  It wasn't that the power steering went out & you would have to ""muscle it"", it was literally locked.  We chalked it up to the possibility that it needed to ""cycle"" since the tech's fixed the issue with the dashboard lighting up.Not so much! 2 days later, driving to the store & start to turn the steering wheel to go into the parking lot & steering wheel locked up yet again. That's twice now in 3 days. I didn't drive the car the rest of the week, but contacted the finance company to see what could be done.  They stated to have the dealership ""unwind"" the loan & get into something else.  Since I had rsvp'd for the new owner clinic that was being held on 1/22, I gave the car one last try...yet again, turning into the dealership it locked again. I talked to my salesman when I got into the showroom & he directed me to the service manager and another gentleman that I believe was the GM.  I explained to the two men my dilemma & how I did not feel safe driving the car. They gave me a loaner & said they would have a tech look it over.  The next day I called the dealership and asked to speak with the GM, I was transferred to the sales manager who stated he would look into the issue and get back to me.  He did call me back, but to let me know the GM was not in and wouldn't be until Thursday.  He was going to follow up with me then.  Thursday afternoon I get a text from the service writer that the car is good, but they would continue to test it and hopefully it would be ready by later in the day.  Meanwhile no call from the sales manager.  Service writer texts me Friday morning that the car is ready, still nothing from the sales manager.  When I went to the dealership on Saturday, I asked to speak with the sale manager.  He blew me off and pushed me back to the salesman.  I told the salesman that I did not feel safe driving that car and wanted out of it.  Takes me to the service writer who says, everything's fixed; that it was a bad battery, they tested it, had 3 different people test drive it and nothing happened.  Again I tell the salesman I don't feel safe in the car, tells me to call him Monday at 11a - he'll see what he can do.  Reluctantly I get into the car & start to drive home.  I get about 20-25 minutes down the road when the the steering wheel locks AGAIN & the steering wheel light with the exclamation point pops up. Then the power steering assist off lights up!  I get about another 10 minutes down the road & the steering wheel light with the exclamation point pops up AGAIN when the steering wheel locked.  At that point, I'm home & send pics of the dash to the salesman who responds by saying come in Monday, he'll get this figured out.  Well here we are Monday, 1/27/2020 - I drive the car to the dealership, tell the salesman to get me out of the car, unwind the loan.  Says he can't has to do it as a trade-in.  Needless to say, I spent 4 hours there getting nothing but the run-a-round.  Finance company tells me one thing, salesman & finance manager something else.  Finance manager says that's it's not easy to unwind the loan & the finance company is making it sound like it is.  Goes on to say that the dealership would lose money if they did the unwind because they would still have to fix the car & then sell it as ""used"".  How is this fair to me???? I had the car 8 days, they've had it the remainder of the time ""fixing"" it.  Finance mgr takes me to service to see about a rental, now I have to pay a ""deposit"" of $50 because they have to go through hertz. Finance mgr asks the service writer if they know the issue yet, to no surprise he says it's pulling the same codes as before. I said no not putting a deposit down for a rental & start walking out. I can't believe they would treat a loyal customer like this. It's not my fault that there's an issue with the car & yet I'm being punished because they don't want to deal with losing money if they unwind the original loan so that I can get into another vehicle.  I'm now stuck with a brand new car that I'm scared 2 drive. Can't wait to see what they say the issue was this time. I WILL NEVER PURCHASE FROM THEM AGAIN.",1.2
6,"January 06, 2020","Lack of knowledge about factory extended warranty. 
2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee affected by leather instrument panel top.  Basically the leather dash has delaminated and has large waves in it. Very easy to see. It should of been an easy 3 step process per the FCA letter. First dealer inspection then ordering parts that will take 3-5 months to show up and setting an appointment to replace the old dash.  Unfortunately they said said I had to leave my car with them for up to 2 days and rent a car at my own expense.  I was very confused by this because it is a top dash that you can see has delaminated from 10 feet away.  Per the FCA letter all that is required is a ‚Äúdealer inspection‚Äù.  
To confirm Tomball Jeep / Dodge story about needing up to two days for the inspection I called Demontrond jeep in conroe and they said they were familiar with the process and it would take 30 minutes to complete the dealer inspection.  
Even the manager of service dept. at Tomball Jerp informed me that they needed my car for a couple days.  
Such a shame because I gave them a 5 star review this 1st time I stopped into their service department. Unfortunately 50/50 is not good enough for me to make the drive back to them.",1.0
7,"January 05, 2020","Vehicle was kept for 2-weeks for a multitude of issues. One item was fixed while the vehicle was over driven for service, abused and not reassembled correctly. The service department engages in incessant lying and they lack of customer service, accountability and communication I found my situation dragged on for several months while trying to work with this incompetent team. Even ownership failed to communicate effectively and support the failures of the service department. Stay away unless you just want to waste your time and money. ",1.0
8,"January 04, 2020","Took my 4X4 2017 2500 in to have 4 recall items addressed. Truck was clean and detailed when taken in. The weather was bright and sunny. It was returned to me when I picked it up with mud caked on the wheel wells and mud on the side of the car and on the floor mat.  I took it back the next day‚Äîthey agreed to clean and detail it for free. They explained that the only place they Have to park vehicles is an unpaved lot with mud holes. It was obvious it had been driven through mud with all 4 wheels engaged. While they cleaned my truck, they did not apologize. Also, the service advisor did not answer his phone or return multiple calls. I will not go back to this dealer. ",1.0
9,"December 26, 2019",Went to this dealership and had a salesperson named Frank who was my salesman.  I test drove a truck and was not offered what I was looking for with my trade.  I was never given a number on what they were selling their truck to me for so I called Frank and ask him to tell me what he wanted for the truck I test drove and he never got back with me. I called to talk to the general manager to get the info and was told I had to speak with Julie and gave her my info and never heard from her either and then I called again to speak with her and never heard back!!!

11,"November 06, 2019","I found a vehicle online that I was interested in, I sent the screen shots to the sales rep that I have used in the past and she responded that it was a mistake and they would not honor their posted pricing. I then posted a review and they responded back and said my review was fake. I reached out and spoke with mike and he blamed it on a ‚Äúglitch‚Äù and said they have no control of mistakes on the internet. He was extremely short and not very professional. I‚Äôm in sales and have been for a very long time and when I misquote I still have to honor that price. That all rubbed me the wrong way so I started reviewing reviews online and seen one a week ago that was for the same issue and they said they are legally obligated to honor pricing. I also have a phone call in with Julie but of course have not heard back from her. This is not my first issue with this dealership. Last year I had a horrible experience with their service department and they begged me to remove my review even though they admitted it was all accurate. I received phone calls for a few weeks of them asking me to take it down. ",1.0
12,"May 06, 2019","In the past 11 years I have purchased 14 vehicles, all new from dealerships. I recently decided to purchase a Jeep, a vehicle I have never owned. After much research I decided on a 2018 Jeep Rubicon. I first checked in Conroe on 4/13/19 and then on the 16th Tomball Dodge. I had plans to check several other dealers‚Äô inventory. Up on arriving at your dealership I was met by salesman Chris Abraham. I advised him that I was interested in a 2018 Jeep Rubicon that was advertised on Tomball‚Äôs website. After checking that vehicle could not be located. I was very precise as to what I wanted and what I wanted to pay. After several days, Chris called me to say he had located a vehicle out of this area. On Sat 20th we went in and completed the purchase. I am writing this review to let you know how pleased I was at the honesty and integrity of Mr. Abraham and because of this I didn‚Äôt check another dealer. As you can see I am not new to purchasing a new vehicle. My experience with Chris rates at the top of all my vehicle purchases. An honest no BS salesman such as Chris is a real asset to your dealership.",4.8
13,"January 02, 2019","Warning: Do not buy from this dealer or any associated dealership... I own a successful landscape company in the Houston area and buy several new vehicles (trucks) a year. I have purchased many ford's and chevy's over my 25 years in business, but heard on the radio and verified on their website some great prices advertised at Tomball dodge so I figured why not try a different product for a change. I emailed them first to make sure there was not a misprint on the price or some other trick some dealers use to get people into their dealership (Bait and Switch). They emailed me back stating the price I seen is the price I would pay, BUT here is the catch... The email was not signed and did give a contact name. So I went to the dealer and explained to the salesperson who greeted us... all of the above. He started claiming some of the discounts I do not qualify for and such. I explained that I do qualify for all the bonus and end of year discounts because the only disclaimer to these were you needed to live in Texas. Salesperson was courteous, but I am not at all used to having to negotiate over an already settled advertised sales price - especially after getting an email as back-up to the advertised price so I promptly walked out. I would not recommend this dealer to anyone and I am writing this review as a warning to people that are not as well versed in buying cars as I am ... to stay away from this dealer. If they tried to scam me, then the average buyer has no chance here... ",1.0
14,"December 18, 2018","Went in for 2 jeep recalls. Rudest men working there , including the service director Patterson and Wheeler who tried to impersonate the actual manager.If you are a woman , make sure you bring your dad , brother , boyfriend, husband , or some Man so you get treated with respect at this place !!!!
Also the shuttle will run late , when promised a rental , make sure you don't have GEICO ins... or you'll have to go offsite to rent the car due to their policy which they do not mention! And they are likely to cause more damage to your jeep . Now my horn won't work because when they replaced the clock spring and airbag , they messed up my horn . They are not at all helpful. Not even when you involve Chrysler corporate . They are rude to them as well ! I've never experienced such horrible service at a dealership ever !!!!",1.0

16,"November 11, 2018","Worst service I have ever had. Did not call when supposed to or return calls. I tried to speak with service manager (Paul) and Julie (Director of Customer Service) after Service Adviser did not return calls or call when he said he would, and never received a call back. On top of that, I had call from customer care survey person who left message for me to please call them about my survey I left, so they could make it right! Not to my surprise I have called three times and left message, to never get a call back They had my had my truck for two weeks while working STAR case with Chrysler. Basically had one communication per day. This was to find two electronic modules on my air conditioner. All I asked was to provide me a loaner car or rental while they worked the case. That would have made it right, but the dealership  nor Chrysler, would do it. Don't get me wrong I love my Ram, but because of this I will probably never own another Chrysler product. It was just too painful of an experience. Oh forgot to mention, during that time my change holder in my console disappeared also. Did not bother to call them on that. ",1.8

24,"June 12, 2018","I am writing this review basically because I have not received any courtesy return calls this morning despite my numerous requests requesting an appointment with someone to discuss last weeks transactions with Tomball Dodge.  

An overview of what has transpired is herein:  I took my Dodge Ram 3500 in for A/C repair service  - basically replacing the HVAC housing/Recirculation door (I had previously bought the part) Ray advised that they had no problem using that part I bought to fix the one broken and frankly, Ray was very good throughout the process  -  He later called me advising that the mechanic stated that the actuators were needing to be replaced - he quoted me price to which I agreed.  And actually my vehicle was ready for pick-up sooner than I had thought.  That afternoon I headed over to Tomball Dodge to pick up my vehicle, spoke with Ray, paid the charges, and drove off.  No sooner than I leave the driveway - there is no air coming out of the Vents.  I was forced to make the turnaround on 249 Highway circling around and coming back to Tomball Dodge in less than 8 miles.  I spoke with Ray advising that the A/C is not blowing out - he went and got the Mechanic who looked at it and stated ""right away"" that the evaporator is bad.  I questioned him and advising why this was not checked or cleaned when he was already under the dash and can clearly can see the evaporator.  He did not respond and walked away.  This cost me $1372.00

Ray was generous enough to arrange a vehicle for me that afternoon as my ride had already left.  

My truck was kept overnight again with an Evaporator charge of $359.76 and another $800.00 labor charge totaling $1250.00.  Upon picking up my vehicle I paid the charges and advised Ray, though he was courteous that I would be contacting General Management to discuss this situation.  

The old evaporator was given to me and left in my truck for my inspection and by the looks of it - I cannot understand whatsoever why this mechanic would not have ""requested"" that this be changed in the initial service -  And he clearly told me prior to walking away that they could not be cleaned.  

Lastly after reviewing my receipts - I do not recall wherein I was advised of or asked for a ""Complete Flush and Refill of the cooling system including heater core and block"" - I have been aware of this situation with my a/c for awhile however, my job sending me out of town, I have attempted to maintain the simple things and this had just been performed by myself 4 weeks ago - so I don't understand why I was charged for this and without consent - as well as the mess left behind under the hood of coolant spots everywhere.

I am extremely disappointed in the service I have been afforded in this matter - especially with your mechanic walking away from any explanation whatsoever, and I believe he did so because I am a mechanic and am very aware of the process in this regard.  I simply do not have time to do my own work because of how busy I am and simply did not want to take the dash apart myself.  I trusted your establishment in providing service according to the gracious discussions with Ray, and therefore, I trusted him and that everything would be taken care of.  

I had also previously spoken to Ray about bringing my truck back in tomorrow (this week)  to deal with the cruise control issue - It had previously been recalled - fixed and is not working again.  He and I discussed this issue at length  as well the purchase of a new 2018 Dodge Ram that I have been thinking about - I had my hopes on the EcoDiesel - and given Ray's courtesy I had thought I found a dealership that I could trust to deliver a good deal. However, given the circumstances now I am not sure that I want to deal with your establishment any longer.

30,"February 06, 2018","I am writing this review to encourage all to take their vehicles to Tomball Dodge, Chrysler, and Jeep. I know taking your vehicle to the 'dealer' is not an exciting experience (having to take your vehicle to any auto repair shop is never positive) due in major part to the stereotypes that are far too often supported by reality. Yet to my surprise, my experience from start to finish, the integrity in the customer service, and the respect given to me, all by Howard Hunt and Darryl Depasquale, will serve as a reminder to me that good people still exist.

My van had not started in a month. It needed multiple rocker arms and four cams to be replaced. Here are the facts of my experience:

o	Howard Hunt, a Service Advisor, called me within one hour of my van arriving via tow truck.
o	On three separate occasions, Howard said he would call me back at a stated time. He always  called me back precisely when he said he would.
o	He gave me his direct phone I could call/text. When I texted him, he replied back almost immediately. (It did take him roughly 10 minutes to reply to one text I sent him.)
o	When communicating, Howard was direct, sincere, and did not provide false hope. (That was actually very refreshing.) Albeit this was a costly repair, because he didn't give false hope, there were no surprises during the entirety of the repair process. 
o	Howard went above and beyond to get the work done in the time I requested. At one point, I did not think it would be possible due to the weekend. Howard actually called me excited because he just so happened to ask his parts guy making a delivery if he had the four cams I needed and he did.
o	After nearly two weeks in the shop and on the day the repairs were complete, Howard Hunt called me to inform me the van's electrical system was causing issues and they were now exploring the problem. My heart sank. He called me back within 15 minutes with excitement and relief explaining to me the mechanic thought it best to unplug and reattach the electrical components to the TIPM system and it worked perfectly. No repairs needed and Howard passionately apologized for having alarmed my wife and I. (I suppose I am not used to having an auto repair shop overly communicate.)
o	I went to get the van right at closing on a Thursday. The bill was a little more than $300 dollars more than quoted. Howard Hunt had already left for the day. Darryl Depasquale (I didn't realize he was the Service Manager) approached me and said he was looking in to the discrepancy. A few minutes later, he pulled me aside to explain to me what happened. Somehow, an element of the original quote I approved did not tally in the total. Although they did the work and I approved the work, Darryl Depasquale owned the mistake saying it was clearly not my fault nor problem, but a mistake on their end and they would honor what they originally quoted. (That was so refreshing! This all happened past closing, lights off, and doors locked.)
o	The most defining moment came the next day when I received a call from Howard Hunt stating they had found a way to save me more money‚Ä¶(I am truly not joking.) Much to my surprise, Darryl Depasquale went beyond all expectations when he gave me back a portion of my bill. That was one of the most humbling experiences of my life.

I wish there were words to describe the kindness, generosity, and sincere customer service I received directly from Howard Hunt and Darryl Depasquale. Much to my shame, I fail to remember the name of the cashier that stayed well after hours with her work completed to simply process my bill as well as another Service individual (I think Julie was her name) who worked alongside Darryl Depasquale to determine the difference in the bill and my original quote.

I am now a proud, life-long customer of Tomball Dodge-Chrysler-Jeep and without question, I trust the people that work there. Howard Hunt and Darryl Depasquale have set the standard for customer relations and customer service and I will continue to pray for their efforts. ",5.0
31,"February 02, 2018","RUN  RUN, RUN!  Do not walk away from this place.  I have NEVER had such a poor experience with anything in my life.  I was lied to by 3 different managers, cussed at and threatened over the phone by one of them, and treated with pure disrespect from the time I signed papers.  The xxxxxxxxx that I signed papers with was less than friendly, less than professional, and had a serious attitude problem while I was signing papers for a $50k+ truck I was purchasing.  Two things were promised to me(one of which was the replacement of a NOX sensor causing the check engine light to remain illuminated)and after 3.5 weeks of them not following through with their promises, being ignored and avoided, I returned the truck, and withdrew the contract.  I took my business elsewhere, and got the same exact truck at literally half the price.  Sunny Ahmed is a horrible salesman, Julie Buck is full of crap, David Bynum is pure xxxx and has a horrible attitude.  I can't stress it enough, STAY AWAY from these immoral xxxxxxxx!",1.0
32,"January 27, 2018","I took my wifes 2015 Challenger RT+ in for an oil change. As we show and travel with our cars i only put full synthetic in them (since they were bought), Upon arrival 15 mins prior to opening time i find that the gates are locked with vehicles parked in front of them, so i drove around the side where i saw an open gate. I asked an employee where service was and why the gates were locked, he told me to just ""drive around the building the service lanes are on the other side. I did so and parked to wait for them to open. No one said anything to me even through there were staff inside the service center looking at me as i sat with my car. Opon opening a service tech coms out and tells me that i will have to wait until last since i came thru the employee entrance. I asked to speak to the manager who sent him to tell me this. This individual was VERY rude, and i was taken back to his office like i was in high school and going to the principals office so that he could talk down to me about what I did wrong and how the issue is my fault. I did what i was told by an employee. 

So i wait an HOUR to get checked in for an OIL CHANGE, then i am told they don't use the same synthetic as other dodge dealers i have gone to ( i am trying this one as we have moved - my preferred dealer is an hour away now). I am told if i want MOBIL 1 they can get it but i will again have to wait. 

They take the car in, then i am told they have the MOBIL 1 oil IN STOCK, do i want it. I said yes. Imaging my surprise when i get the bill for 130 for an oil change and filter for a car. I then approached the service rep and said this is way high, i was told that i should use penzoil because it is cheaper. 

This is my second attempt to give this dealership business, on a previous occasion i was told by the same service manager that a service APPOINTMENT (that i had to schedule 3 weeks out to fit in) was not really an appointment but a sheduled time to shop up and at that time its first come first servce, but if you have an appointment all of the people with appointments go in order of who was there first.

I would encourage this dealership to recognize that an appointment is exactly that, does your doctos or hospital work this way for an appointment? As someone with 3 dodge vehicles i am in a dealer for service on something at least once a month. 

This dealership will never receive another $$ of mine or my family. Nor will i ever by a vehicle from them. Beware of who you have service your vehicle... they may be rude and unethical.

A very Special Thank You to Frank Hernandez for dealing with my wife and I! He gave us one of the best experiences with sales and customer service that we had ever had! From staying in contact with us throughout our carbuying process, to making sure we were right at home at the dealer, going with us on the test drives, to getting my 2 sons sancks and drinks! Another Thank you to John Hayes who ended up dealing with my stubbornness on the day we took home our Ram! I felt like I came off to strong that day, and even then, with him taking my demands, he went above and beyond to get us in the dealership, and out with our Truck in a very timely and friendly fashion. He worked his magic for us to be able to take home our Ram and giving us a great deal! It might have been one of the quickest sales I've seen! Another Thank you to Joshua Moore in finance! With explaining everything down to the T! Getting us the warranties and extra protection plans that we didn't want, and still coming in well within our budget! Thanks to Brian Devito over in aftermarket who made sure we got our bedliner and window tint in, in a friendly and timely fashion! Overall, we feel that it was Godsent to have been in Tomball Dodge for our truck purchase! Quality Customer Service was one of our main concerns and they nailed it!

Repairs were completed on my vehicle, and I was able to pick it up on October 22, 2015.  As anyone can see, this was 3 days short of two months to complete the repairs on my vehicle.  In my opinion, this was totally unacceptable for it to take that long to complete my repairs.  Never did it seem a great concern that it was taking that long to repair, and never did they even offer me a loaner vehicle while my vehicle was in the shop.  Fortunately, the repair was covered, so I was only out the cost of the rental vehicle...which, I believe, should have also been covered.

Matt was able to help us look through all our options and worked extremely hard to find us the perfect vehicle that fit our entire wish list at the price we wanted to pay!!  Between Matt and his sales manager Jeff we quickly settled on the numbers and were able to get into our dream Jeep within a week!  Could not recommend a salesman or dealership more highly than I do Matt and Tomball Dodge.  There were no games, and Matt went through all the options available, and even walked us through his own Jeep to show us some of the items that we had questions about. No pressure felt throughout the entire deal, and extremely freindly staff made it an exciting experience buying his Jeep...it is nice to drive away feeling like you made a great deal.",5.0

107,"April 23, 2015","We are previous customers of this dealership, out of loyalty to our salesmen we decided to go back to buy another car. After two days of waiting for the deal to be completed they called and said they got us the payment we wanted, so we returned to complete paperwork. After getting there we got into finance only to find out that the reason they got the payments down was because they not only removed the gap and warranty but they also decided to take the gap and warranty cancellation fees from our trade in and add those as a down payment. None of this was disclosed to us, we were told we would be financing a certain amount with no money down and never were we told of cancellation fee's until we got into the finance office. We do feel bad for our salesman Mike as he is on vacation and left our account in someone else's hands to complete and now he will return to no deal at all because we told them how dishonest they are and walked out. 
This is only one of the many issues we have had with this dealership. The other is the service department not being able to fix an issue with my jeep that they too have dealt with. The only bonus is my jeep is still under warranty but I think after two years they could get the issue fix. 
Just beware, if you are looking to have a pleasant experience and to be treated with respect and honestly this is not the dealership for you. ",1.8

116,"January 22, 2015","The service department at Tomball Dodge is very deceitful and will tell you what you want to hear until it comes time to pay the bill. I waited a few days before I decided to tell my story. I was so upset and I needed time to cool off so I didn't write something that I might regret later. My name is Micah Martin the owner of a 2011 Dodge Ram pickup. I have been a very loyal customer of the Tomball dealership family. I have bought many vehicles from the Ford and dodge dealerships through the years and have had great sales experiences. This is the first time I had to use their service department. I will tell you to stay away from Vernon. The biggest problem I have with Vernon is him not being honest with me throughout my entire service experience. My engine light came on, so since the vehicle was under warranty I brought it to the dealership to fix the issues. The issue turned out to be a problem with the transmission and engine. I purchased an extended warranty when I bought the vehicle. Vernon told me that because the problems involved the power train that Chrysler would cover the repairs because the vehicle was still under the 7 year 100,000 warranty, that was great news. Now comes the issue with Vernon that I was upset about. He told me that my vehicle could be in the shop for up to two weeks. When he told me that I told him that I would need a rental to drive then. He looked up my warranty and stated that he may not be able to get Chrysler to pay for all of the days for my rental but he could get them to cover some of the time. Then He told me that he could also get the company that I had my extended warranty through to pay for some of the time for the rental as well. He felt that between the two, Chrysler and extended warranty co, he should be able to get six days covered. I wasn't happy about it but what was I suppose to do. I dropped it off on a Thursday and finally received a call from Vernon on the following Monday telling me what the issues were with my vehicle. As of Monday they hadn't started any repairs yet but they know what is wrong with the vehicle by now. Monday would have made day five for the rental. I specifically asked Vernon ""hey what about my rental, it's almost been six days, do I need to come in and give it back?"" Vernon stated "" don't worry about it just go on like you normally do. Since there are engine problems too I should be able to get you more days for your rental."" To me he is telling me don't worry about it he would take care of me. Trusting Vernon was my mistake. After having the rental for 9 days Vernon called and said my truck was ready for pickup. When I arrived to get my truck this is when I started to get upset. On the day I pick up my truck Vernon tells me that he was only able to get 2 days covered for my rental, yes I said 2 days. When I asked him to explain it he fed me some bull crap about Chrysler not covering it because it was a BASIC repair. A basic repair? So working on the engine and the transmission is a BASIC repair? I'm no mechanic but that sound pretty unbasic to me. Now remember I received a call from Vernon on day five regarding my repairs. This is the point where Vernon should have already called Chrysler and got the days approved for my rental. Instead he didn't get the days approved and then waited until the day I picked up my truck to tell me that the days were not approved. This is why I'm upset. To me that is not being honest and up front. To me Vernon was being deceitful to me about my repairs. Be up front with me and let me decide if I want to pay for extra days for the rental. Don't wait until the day of to tell me. The charge for the rental ended up being almost $500. Thank God I did buy the extended warranty because they did cover 3 of the 9 days for the rental. I called back over to Vernon when I turned in my rental to see if there was anything that they were willing to do to help with the rental and I was basically told no. That I would have to pay it and then try and get some sort of reimbursement. Really, thanks for nothing. This has left a very bad taste in my mouth with the Tomball family. It's going to be hard for me to go back to buy another vehicle there or tell anyone else to go there. Beware of Vernon, he will tell you what you want to hear.",1.0

120,"November 07, 2014","Customers do not go to Tomball dodge, I do not recommend anyone to purchase or service their vehicles with Tomball Dodge, in my opinion anyone who needs to buy a vehicle should go to spring dodge. My buddy bought two of his trucks from over there in the same month and they treated him like family. At spring dodge they call you to see how you‚Äôre doing even after the deal has been made unlike Tomball dodge they treat you with disrespect and they do not follow up on their agreement.  My sale guy Frank Oloh is not the person people should be talking to. My problem was when I bought my truck that it had to have the navigation system set up because I will be doing a lot of traveling, I stated it in the office when I bought my truck and on top of that my buddy was there to back my statement. You know what else make its funny if I am not mistaken a good sales person should be there all the way till the end where the buyer drives off the dealership, Frank  Oloh was not even there when I drove off. He did that so that I will not be able to ask him about our agreement there sales people told me to talk to frank and he should get it for you if that was part of the agreement. on top of that he send me a message saying that my package was a lone star ram, What difference does it make what package it is, deal is a deal and  Frank  is a liar and if he agrees to it later he tells you a bull shit answer like you can buy for X amount.  Frank is the worst car sales man I have ever dealt with.  After I bought my truck, the same guy who bought the two trucks from spring dodge went up to him to ask him about trucks because at the time he was in the market looking, he totally pushed him aside and ignored him, in my opinion  that‚Äôs a bad sales man.

121,"November 02, 2014","My name is Ronnie J Fontenot.  My family and I relocated to the Tomball area immediately following retirement from the U.S. Federal Government in September 2008.  Looking around various car dealerships for reliable transportation, we ultimately settled with the purchase of a 2009 Dodge Journey from Tomball Dodge.  

We still own the 2009 Journey with its low mileage and still ""Looks-Like-New"" condition.  I have always believed that ""if you take care of your transportation, it will take care of you""....and it really has.  Over the years it has been my great pleasure to witness several individual performances of such high caliber and quality that meaningful recognition was unquestionably warranted.  This review deals with one such performance by Mr. Sammy Elahmad of which I endorse a ""Five Star"" rating. 

On September 21, 2014, I arrived at Tomball Dodge without an appointment to have my 2009 Dodge Journey service due to a Safety Recall Notice L25/NHTSA 14V-373, the Frequency Operated Button Ignition Key (FOBIK) which may not fully seat in the ""ON"" position upon starting the vehicle, which could increase the risk of a crash under certain driving conditions and increase the risk of occupant injury during a crash.  Tomball Dodge was extremely BUSY that morning with many vehicles already in the service bays being attended to, coupled with other vehicles - including mine - just ""rolling in"" lining up in the service line to be assisted to by a SERVICE ADVISOR.  Despite the deluge of vehicles being serviced or waiting to be serviced, Mr. Elahmad's immediate attention to my needs was ""Five Stars"".  

My experience at Tomball Dodge has always been GREAT!  Mr. Elahmad is customer service oriented; always professional and courteous.  Someone who really cares about the customer.  Each time I bring my 2009 Dodge Journey in for servicing, it is a pleasure seeing Mr. Elahmad standing behind the service counter.  Tomball Dodge has an EXCELLENT employee in Mr. Elahmad.  My ""Five Star"" rating of Mr. Elahmad early on in this review is spot on.  Keep up the Great Work!",5.0
122,"October 29, 2014","We are buying my wife a new Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland. The initial visit (10/24) was very good and a salesman ""Mark"" took us on a few test drives. I told him we would call the next day and come back to see him and he agreed. After deciding on the equipment package overnight, I called the dealership on 10/25 and was told ""I haven't seen him, he might not be coming in"", so I texted him. Never a reply. We decided to go up anyway and talk to someone else. Another salesman (didn't get his name) quickly sat us down and we told him what package my wife wanted on the Jeep. He came back a short time later telling us there was one vehicle like that and it was near Dallas and trying to push what inventory they had there in 2014's. While we waited for over an hour at his desk, he said he was texting and calling the dealership to see if they would release it. After giving him my preferred supplier pricing from my company, he said it would cost $1200 extra to get that vehicle here and that he would split it with me. I told him we could order one (6 weeks to get in) and he said I would have to put $1000 down to do that (not hold my check but cash it). We left and drove straight to Northwest Dodge on 290 near Hwy 6. They located the same Jeep Grand Cherokee and it is here 2 days later and we pick it up tonight. No extra charges and they sold it to us $1500 cheaper (rebates and incentives Tomball ""forgot"" to include). Northwest told me they would order one if for some reason they couldn't get that one and no I wouldn't have to put $1000 up front down. I was told that dealers have an entire department that handles vehicle swaps and it was an unspoken rule they didn't call on Saturdays, much less salesman to salesman. I still have not heard anything from Tomball 3 days later. I guess they just weren't making enough money on the deal. Make the short drive to Northwest Dodge/Jeep/Chrysler - you won't regret it.",1.2

I was told it was a very involved process including removing the wheel well to access. Didn't have that much time so I agreed. Tech logged .6 hours on recall and 1.5 hours on speed sensor (total 2.1 hours). Dash cam recorded 62 minutes from time it was driven into the shop and parked after a test drive. Looked at it when I got it home and I could have changed it like I told them I could without even lifting the car or removing the tire. Was charged 195.00 for 20 min of labor on a 19.95 part.

They put my wife in a rental for 7 weeks and never repaired the damage in those seven weeks. So I took my vehicle back and now they are trying to claim they didn't damage my vehicle. I have had to file an insurance claim against Tomball Dodge for the cost of the repairs that I have to get done at a different repair shop.

I feel that more than just the oil changes are slippery at Tomball Dodge. I feel they were very disorganized, made false promises, didn't return calls, or keep promises made. Senior executives promised to return calls and scheduled for me to come in and meet with them, and did not call and left me waiting for hours and never met with me. Calls were not returned for several weeks only after escalating to the owner. Even after escalating to the owner it took more than a week to get a call back.

The amount of headache it has caused me and my wife is unbelievable. We had bought or leased at least 8 vehicles from this dealer group and to get this level of poor customer service was appalling. Actually I personally feel it was negligent and deceptive customer service.

140,"November 26, 2013","Reason for poor review: Serious Safety hazard caused by factory defect identified and unrepaired after 5 months.

Just to be fair, Samantha, Anthony and Wendy  were very courteous and friendly. Paul was not.

I turned my vehicle (Dodge Grand Caravan) in for a manufacturers defect service request (a very sharp steel corner protruding from the outside of the rear seat cut the tip of my finger nearly completely off). Based on Tomball Dodge's review of the rear seats, I was offered a rental vehicle by the dealership until the safety hazard was repaired. It took Tomball Dodge and Chrysler 3 months and multiple attempts to try and resolve the issue with my vehicle, but were unsuccessful and returned the vehicle to me unrepaired with the hazard still present. This safety hazard is present in all Dodge Grand Caravans like mine. Since I've received my vehicle back, 2 of my children almost had the exact same injury from this protruding piece of steel. I have taken steps to minimize the risk to my children and myself.
My intention is to document this online in the event that other persons have the same issue.

145,"June 03, 2013","I came in to see if it ""made sense"" to trade in my 2008 Ram for a new truck.  BIG MISTAKE.  Awful experience with BJ and Kroll.  Their aggressive sales tactics, non-existent listening skills, and inability to provide accurate information made my experience at Tomball Dodge the worst I have ever experienced. 

They refused to provide me accurate financial information for the transaction and in fact kept moving the numbers around just to make it more confusing.  Additionally, they refused to acknowledge publicly printed prices and i felt I was in a ""bait and switch"" situation.  They kept trying to negotiate on monthly payment when I want to know bottom line price.  And they did not respect my clearly stated time schedule for when I told them I had to leave.

When I wanted to leave, I calmly explained the deal did not make financial sense for me but it took several requests for them to return my keys to me (which they had in order to evaluate my trade in).

 The only way it would have been worse is if I actually bought something.",2.3
146,"May 30, 2013","My experience at this dealer ship was phenomenal. My sales representative, has truly found his calling in life.

147,"May 25, 2013","I responded to an ad on the internet and called.  Was transferred to a salesperson named Sonny who's English left a lot to be desired.  I had been emailed an offer.  We were pre-approved and was going to use my 2010 Dodge truck as a trade in.  Sonny assured me they had over 2 dozen of the advertised vehicle's in stock.  A variety of colors and just come down.  
I tried to touch base with Sonny and finally asked the receptionist to transfer me to someone to set an appt.  I then talked to Joe who did call me back however they were ""out"" of the deal "" that I had been offered and the next priced vehicle was 9K more however he did have a three year old truck that he could possibly come close to the price I was given on a new truck.  
I told him that I felt they were doing a bait and switch operation and he told me he was not going to lie to me and he had no idea what had happened to all those trucks-I had stock numbers by the way-from 8;30 a night until 9 a.m. the following morning.  His parting shot to me when I told him I had 110k miles on my vehicle was well you need to trade it in before it craters on you.  That was not saying much for the Dodge product.  I have owned 6 Dodge trucks, one which was retired at 500,000 miles.  
I was totally disgusted with this attitude all the way around and called my husband to tell him not to bother to go by there.  We went to another dealership and bought a truck that was much more than I could have got from Tomball with wonderful people who gave us a wonderful price and we were not lied to.  They understood that customer service and being truthful gets people in the door and keeps them coming back.  Next fall when we replace my husbands truck we know where we are going.

The customer service was outstanding.  Everyone explained every step of the process.  At nop time did I ever feel uncomfortable.  We received a great price.  I also got a better interest rate through the dealership than the credit union that I was approved at.  This was by far the best experience I have ever had at a dealership.

149,"April 26, 2013",DO NOT GO HERE unless you plan on paying near sticker price. I went in after seeing a 2012 truck online I wanted. I had planned on paying cash for it. I went in already knowing the internet price. They came at me with the sticker price after asking for the invoice. I told them no way that I already knew the internet price and wanted to make a deal. I offered them 2 grand less than the internet price Cash and they refused to sell me a truck that has been on their lot for over 15 months and is now over a year old. They have over twenty five 2012 trucks on their lot. I now see why they still have that many and No other dodge dealer in the greater Houston area has any. Don't waste your time going here.,2.4

He is a people person and has knowledge of what he is selling as far as specs and what the vehicle has to offer. We had been at the dealership for a little bit. I had not eaten lunch yet and without me even asking Jack got a Subway sandwich for me. He went out of his way to do that and did not have to. While we were waiting he also had a genuine interest in getting to know my family and I. The price of the truck I purchased was great. They threw in a free bedliner as well as running boards. The finance guy (Rock I think is his name) was a lot of fun to be around and made great recommendations to what route I should choose as far as extended warranty and gap insurance.

159,"December 08, 2012","WOW-- I went to Tomball Dodge today to get some pricing because my wife and I are considering upgrade to a safer company truck since we are having a new born in may.  So go to test drive and get pricing so we can consider the price. Wasn't there to shop and compare because my wife works for HP and we get fleet pricing anyways so all the dealer will be almost excatly the same. I told chris that.  Chris at first was very nice and then when we go inside to site down we get well hold on a minute and then the young manager shows up.  First smart thing to do would have been to shake my wife and my hand in interduce himself showing some respect.  Nope. Then site and start telling us that when we are ready to purchase to let chris know and he would give me a price since we don't want to buy tonight.  I said really you can't qoute me a price so we can weight the buget effects and see if we can purchase the truck sooner.  All of this I had explained the whole time I was there that we are not looking to buy tonight.  Then we get told we don't want to give you a price because you are going to shop us around.  Which is not true because of the fleet price for my wifes work.  and that scares me.  If you aren't buying tonight then we won't give you a price, that's pressure sales and I sure as heck won't every purchase a truck from Tomball Dodge or from Tomball Ford ever.  What because I want to budget something40- 50k large.  Buyer beware I won't shop at either of this owners location.  Also I run a remodeling company and I want the owner of the dealership and that manager to call me when they want a job done and I will tell them sorry until you sign this contract that I am doing the work for you I won't tell you a price.

After test-driving one truck, and looking at a few others, we said we wanted to look at Tomball Dodge before making up our mind. Warren Lee, our salesman, offered to take us over and introduce us to ""Just Jack,"" saying, ""I just want y'all to be happy.""  We were very impressed with his willingness to do this.  We did, fact, buy a truck off the Tomball Dodge lot, and our experience with ""Just Jack"" was excellent.  We told him we were on a timeline, and we were driving off the lot in our newly purchased truck less than 3 hours after arriving on the lot.

Our salesman (Jack Velasques) was extremely knowledgeable, and enthusiastic. I had shopped around to find the right car and I found Jack at Tomball Dodge to be the friendliest and gave the best customer service around. We had looked at one vehicle which was very nice which Jack assured us was indeed a great car but he was honest in opinion and with questions trying to find out what our real needs were.  Was this car the right car for us and our needs? He spoke to us of all the great aspects of the car but pointed out from what we had told him this car really did not meet our real needs. Long story short we ended up in a car that suited every one of our needs and wants thanks to him. We could not be happier with our purchase and with our experience at Tomball Dodge.

199,"October 25, 2011","This past Saturday I dropped by the dealership to look at the 2012 Jeep Wranglers and get some hands on experience with them.  I had already ""built"" my own Rubicon on the Jeep website and pretty much had this model in mind.  I was approached by LEANDRE LIGGINS who was extremely personable and knowledgeable about the vehilces.  I drove a used model and then a 2012.  In our conversation about why I wanted a Jeep, Leandre uncovered that I really did not need a Rubicon and that I would be much happier with the Sport verson.  To be honest he is right.  I don't want to go rock climbing or do any of the other extreme things a Rubicon can do.

I did not leave the dealership with a new Wrangler that night as I am not ready to purchase.  I do have my heart set on a color that is difficult to come by.

Once everything is right to make the purchase I will return to this dealership to purchase from Leandre, and only Leandre.

I was driving to my parents house on Monday and happened by another Jeep dealership.  On a whim I stopped  just to see if they possibly had vehicle the color I wanted.  As soon as I got out of my truck a salesman almost attacked me and tried to put the full court press on me to buy one of their vehicles.  I politely asked if they had Dosier colored vehicle, specificaly the Wrangler.  He had to go inside to see if they did (they only had 3 Wranglers on the lot).  He allowed me to walk all the way arcoss the lot and back before he came out of the building with a partial brochure and proceded to tell me the color I was looking for was stone grey.  It took all I had to not laugh in his face.  He was looking at the 3rd rock down on the stack.  I did tell him that he need to know the vehicle a little better and that ""I required a salesman who knew what he was talking about, more like Tomball's Leandre.""

200,"October 21, 2011","Hidden prices galore! We were charged extra for the following dealer installed items, despite not having any desire for any of them:

- Mopar Electronic Vehicle Tracking System (EVTS) - $599
- VIN etched windows - $599
- Interior and Exterior protection - $595

In fact, we were told that the EVTS would be included in the price of the vehicle and would not be charged. Turns out, we were charged, and the salesman flat out lied to us when we confronted him about this charge two days later. Lies, lies, lies- that's what this dealership specializes in. We were never informed of the VIN etching or the Interior/Exterior protection until we sat down in the finance office. We didn't know that we would have to pay for either of these until we had time to sit down and review the contract the next day (the dealership was closed by the time we got to the finance office, so we were rushed out the doors after each piece of paper was shoved in front of us to sign).

Will NEVER do business with them again in any capacity. Would not recommend them even to my worst enemy. Dishonest, unfair, and pushy. Tomball Dodge, you should be ashamed.",1.5

208,"December 21, 2010","After visiting a few other dealerships I thought they were all the same. I found out differently when I visited Tomball Dodge Chrysler Jeep. The friendliness of the staff was second to none. Even though I wasn't sure what model I wanted I didn't get the ""hurry up and decide"" treatment or the ""You're wasting my time"" treatment I got from other places. I got the ""take your time and get what's right for You"" treatment which was really refreshing. My sales person spent a lot of time with me and taught me a lot about all the models I was interested in. All my questions were answered directly and without hesitation which I really appreciated. The best part was I never felt any pressure like I did at every other dealership I have visited. I haven't bought my new car yet because I'm not quite ready but when I am I'm definitely going back to Tomball Dodge Chrylser Jeep.  ",5.0

210,"November 22, 2010","Went in to dealer to have a water pump on my van replaced. The first thing the service writer did was try to sell me more service I did not need. The service Tech tried to tell me that my radiator had a blockage. Than they came back with an out of this world price to replace the water pump. They also told me that the wrong color Anti-freeze was in the radiator. Does not take a rocket scientist to know when you are losing so much coolant due to the water pump leak that you may not have the same color anti-freeze to add until the repair is completed. After spending most of my day waiting at the dealership the service writer came out and said that they could not install the water pump unless I get a new radiator.  Long story short........ I took my truck to another repair center. The truck DID NOT HAVE ANY BLOCKAGE IN THE RADIATOr, the water pump and the radiator was flushed and the problem is solved. The price was half of TOMBALL DODGE and my truck was ready the same day and washed before I picked it up.  These guys at Dodge are CROOKS! The manager, David Mcelmurry, supported the rip-off and refused to repair my truck. That guy should be looking for a new job. The owner of the dealership could not be reached. I no longer will bring any of my cars or trucks to this dealership. ",1.8

228,"November 03, 2009","Took Ram 1500 in for warranty work on PCM, because I had an error code that indicated it was failing.  They properly checked and replaced the PCM without charge.

However, the problem is they flat out lied to me regarding subsequent problems.  I have the lie recorded on my cell phone.

After replacing the PCM, the engine idle speed was too high, and I could not get an inspection sticker.  Although I thought it was the IAC (idle air control) I took it back because it might be the PCM.  They said it could be many different things.

I suggested they check the IAC (idle air control).  On the Internet, it says this causes high idle speed or other idle speed problems 99 of 100 times.

They told me ""to begin with"" a complete tune up was required, fuel injection, spark plugs, throttle body cleaned, injectors cleaned, and an additional $100 diagnostic fee, (which had been done as part of the original change of the PCM). 

They said these were ""mandatory"" to fix the problem.  I had already changed the spark plugs but unfortunately agreed to the throttle body and injector cleaning.  Did not fix the problem.  Paid $250 for nothing.  I could have sprayed cleaner into throttle body myself and done as much good.

Then they said I had a leak in the intake manifold gasket that had to be replace along with the IAC.  Cost $1300

I said change the IAC first.  They said they COULD NOT replace the IAC without diassembling the intake manifold gasket.  They said the IAC is inside the intake manifold. This is a lie!  The IAC is next to the throttle body and is easily changed by removing two screws.  Takes about 10 minutes.  When I knew they were flat lying to me, I complained to the manager.  He said this was a ""hard sale"" (not a lie even though it is) and would not even apologize for the lying.  He said this was the ""wrong approach"".  He thought the guy should have said the same thing in a different way.

I took the car back home from the dealership and bought an IAC on the Internet. Bought torx screw kit ($60 total). Did it myself.  This fixed the problem.  Took 10 minutes and two screws to complete the job, and I am not a mechanic. The idle was fixed and I was able to get an inspection sticker.

Do not trust your car to Tomball Dodge unless you have lots of money and don't care if what is done will fix the car or not.

229,"October 21, 2009",Dropped my Ram truck off 9:00 am Mon for trans problem. Didn't hear back by 3:30 Tue so called to find status; said they didn't know and would call back. Didn't hear back by 12:00 Wed so called again; was told problem couldn't be ID'd so I asked for the service tech to call me. It's now 4:30 and still no return call. My complaint is not that they can't fix the problem but that I have never received a return call. I had the same experience when I left my truck there before for 4 days but I thought perhaps someone was having a bad hair day but now it's obviously endemic. I've got a company to run and commitments to reschedule and I don't think that it is unreasonable to expect a return call with information in a reasonable period of time. If we acted the same way with our customers we'd be out of business. ,2.0

I dropped my car off at 9:30 am.  At 2:00pm I called and they still have not looked at it.  I told the service man I needed to be somewhere by 3:00 and could he please take a look at it.  Arrived back at 2:30pm and he told me couldnt find anything.  I asked the tech that looked at my car if he had checked the bulb that may be out, he said no.

231,"July 15, 2009","They would not even give me a sticker price on the phone, 5 minutes later they gave my male co-worker a sticker price over the phone. Went in and test drove because a coworker recommended the dealership. I would have ended up paying way too much for the vehicle in the long run. They assured me that there was no way to get my monthly payments down or to finance for less than 72 months. They also told me I could not be on the title with my co-signer because even with my high income and good credit the finance company still thought it was too much to lend me. Their response was ""If it doesn't work for you it doesn't work for you, you need to put more down or expect higher payments."" They couldn't even give me a ballpark interest rate. When I told them I wasn't going to commit to that long of a payment without knowing the interest rate before I signed they said ""Well it sounds to me like you are just being difficult"". What happened to the customer is always right?
