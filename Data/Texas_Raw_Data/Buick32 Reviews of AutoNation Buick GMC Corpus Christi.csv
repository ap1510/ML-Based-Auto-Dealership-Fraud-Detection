4,"January 15, 2020","I have tried to notify and fix all issues and they won't even return my calls.  They didn't make the repairs asked and now I have more things wrong than there was when I took my vehicle in.  They don't care about you or your vehicle and to quote George the service person I dealt this "" I don't care... Its just a job.  My life and concerns are my home. ""  Pretty sad. AND even more embarrassing him and the woman next to him made jokes about me and my issues.  
They treated my belongings and vehicle like a trash can.  SOOO VERY DISAPPOINTED,  Will NEVER GO BACK AND WOULDN'T EVEN RECOMMEND TO MY ENEMIES. ",1.0

6,"August 07, 2019","I made a Service Appointment online and when I arrived, I was greeted by Service Advisor Samantha L. She was very professional and courteous throughout the entire visit. Her Communication with me was beyond expectations.  Samantha has such a Great Attitude and she truly cares about her customers. I am very impressed with her Customer Service skills and product knowledge. I encourage anyone needing Service, to ask for Samantha L......
Samantha made my visit to Autonation a pleasant experience and believe she is a true asset to the company. ",5.0

10,"March 10, 2019",Brought my vehicle in for a turbo issue and coolant leak. it took them almost two months to diagnose and service the vehicle. it took them 3 weeks before they even communicated with a warranty company that the work was being performed through ended up costing me over a grand an Rental charges for a vehicle to use while my truck was being serviced. 0 phone calls were returned to me from the service writer the service manager and the general manager for weeks at a time,1.0

12,"January 21, 2019","After speaking with two different service reps (first one quit and never placed order for parts) then having the Service Manager call me about a previous poor rating, they still cannot get it right and after 6 weeks and they have not ordered the right parts. I have never seen this kind of incompetence from a Chevy Dealer, the issues start at the top with the Service Manager and trickle down. I am not going back and will try a different dealer to get my parts. Unbelievable with todays technology!",1.8
13,"January 08, 2019","My service expert is very descriptive and goes about and beyond, with assistance of any service required matter to obtaining coupons for the best rates. I pleased from the time I drop of my vehicle for servicing to the time I pickup my vehicle. I am always updated with status of issues and never left in anticipation. ",5.0
14,"December 01, 2018",We bought a vehicle from auto nation a few months ago and have had to take it in several times for service. This place is very disorganized and the customer service is horrible. We will never purchase another vehicle from auto natio or use the service department again. Lesson learned.,1.0
15,"November 04, 2018",The service deptwas suppose to make sure the truck was ready to go when i bought it and i have had going on 3 mths and have spent money on repairs and have taken it back twice for them to look at it and it still needs work mechanics there do not know nothing about cars they meed more experience. There service department needs new management and mechanics,1.0
16,"August 22, 2018","I would not recommend the dealership to anyone. Their repair shop is awful and no one seems to ever know what is going on. I had an issue with my Silverado that had to get escalated to the Director of Service in order for any progression to happen with my truck. 

I never put any blame on the service advisors, as they are only taking appointments and asking about consumer concerns. 

I will be following up again with GM and with this dealership.3",1.2
17,"August 20, 2018",Great service from purchase to repairs to trade in. Nieves Cerda has always taken care of me and my family. We have been doing business with him since 2009. ,5.0
18,"August 03, 2018","As I walked in the door, I immediately locked eyes with a man named Jason. I knew he was the one. My problem was a non functioning radio. As I approached his podium he gave me a spectacular greeting: ""God bless America, welcome to the greatest service department in Texas. How may I help you."" The experience was perfect. As I waited my service advisor brought me American brewed black coffee and proceeded to massage my feet, even though I warned him of the rough case of athletes foot I have had since basic training. When I got into my truck it smelled amazing. As though the detail crew had sprayed essence of gunpowder and independence. As I drove away I looked in the rearview mirror. Jason was standing there, waving goodbye slowly. I found a single tear fall down my cheek. I would long for my next service visit, and pray that it would be Jason that took care of me again.
I highly recommend this Full service department.",5.0
19,"May 02, 2018","Had the misfortune of vehicle not starting in Corpus Christi when trying to make the return trip home to San Antonio on Sun afternoon Apr 22nd. Had vehicle (2012 Terrain) towed into Autonation Buick GMC the following morning. The service advisor, George, came out after a few hours and indicated I need a new key at a cost of 348.85. The 'so called' repair was made and we were on the road home at approx. 1:25p. Drove straight to San Antonio, no stops, until I arrived home. Went out at approx. 8pm to move vehicle into garage and vehicle would not start with the new key I just obtained earlier in the day. I tried my secondary key, which has only been used approx. 3 times since purchase of the vehicle, & it as well would not start vehicle. Called Autonation the following morning, Tues. Left vm's for George and his mgr Roland Pena. When I had no call back, nor could speak with anyone at Autonation in Corpus Christi, I had the vehicle towed to Cavender North GMC in San Antonio. After a few hours the svc adviser from there, Brian, called to inform me the diagnostic tests revealed two codes B3055 & B3935. Was told initially code B3055 is indicative of a key being needed or reprogrammed... BUT need to test (several times as it can be intermittent) and if code or codes reappear afterwards the modules need to be replaced which was my case at a cost of 824.00. I continued to make calls to Autonation, leaving vm's telling them exactly what the local dealer found, which were still not responded to. On Wed morning I called General Motor customer svc number to file a complaint re: Autonation. Suddenly Thurs morning I receive a call from a Mr. John Champion whom is some sort of service advocate at Autonation & a few hrs later a call from George the svc advisor. Mr. Champion called several times from that day forward telling me they did he right thing, made the necessary repair, regardless of the fact that less than 7hrs later my vehicle would not start again. He stated, per the 'feedback he rec'd only one code came up for them. I then asked during one of his calls on Friday and have continued to ask since, where is it documented on my paperwork from them the number of codes and the exact code number they say was addressed during their repair. CRICKETS.....So, if I follow Autonations line of thinking or lack thereof, I would continue paying for each 'temporary' fix they come up with, instead of fixing the issue the 1st time. ALL I ASK FOR IS TRANSPARENCY OF WORK PERFORMED. I have NO idea how many codes and what code came up for Autonation and apparently they don't either. It is not on my worksheet, not on receipt BUT they were very thorough and meticulous in outlining/detailing other inspections and recommendations of work to be performed..cooling sys svc, brake fluid exchng, fuel sys svc. Again, there is NO documentation regarding the exact codes and number of codes and Autonation feels no regrets in not repairing my vehicle correctly nor refunding my money for the INCOMPETENT repair made.",1.2
20,"March 26, 2018",Took in new vehicle for oil change for first time. Two days later I received alert that I needed washer fluid. Don’t think they “topped” off my fluids during the oil change visit. Had to schedule appt a month in advance for separate issue bc that was the soonest they could have a loaner available. ,1.0
21,"March 02, 2018","Mr. Castro is one of the best service advisors I have ever had the pleasure to work with. His work ethic and pleasant demeanor embody the spirit of quality customer service. If you had 10 George Castro's, your service department would be the model for the entire nation. When I drop off my truck to Goerge, not only do I know my truck is in good hands, but my pocket book as well. His assessment of my vehicle was honest, and there is no other person in the shop that I would trust to accurately assess and quote my repair. I look forward to my next service visit with George. ",5.0
22,"January 22, 2018","We showed up for a standard oil change. After walking into the service area, we stood unacknowledged for 10 minutes.  When one lady finally asked if we needed help and then quickly realized we didn't have an appointment with her she responded with ""Well, anyone could have helped you then, not just me!"" She then very rudely hurried through paperwork and when we asked for an explanation of what we signing she rolled her eyes and said snapped that we are signing for the oil change of course. We were prepared to leave our vehicle since we didn't have an appointment, however it took a total of 6.5 hours for us to get our car back, and that is only because my husband finally told them he would wait for it. We will not be going back to this location. ",2.2
23,"January 16, 2018","Scheduling the service was automated and easy which accounts for the 2 stars. I never received a call from the service advisor until after I called late in the afternoon. Apparently, my vehicle had been complete for sometime prior to that call. The car was not washed or detailed as is the case at many dealerships. Overall, this service depart could use some management direction.",1.8

25,"November 23, 2017","First in the days prior I had questions about my appt, I literally called 6x left messages with no call back until the last call when I notified them I was on my 6th call. I spoke to parts and another department trying to get a quote on a battery or see if the battery I had at home would work since I was low on money I was trying to budget ( in the first place I shouldn't have had a battery that went bad only having my vehicle for a year, certified used or not), both confirmed a battery price of $140 plus tax. On the day of my appt I went in asked if the battery I had could be used since it was brand new and they were too lazy to check and were getting ready to go to lunch( how convenient to schedule lunch when I'm scheduled for 2pm appt). Guy says they can't try it and that I need to buy new battery, I reluctantly said ok what else could I do, I made sure to confirm a battery costing $140 plus tax BOTHBagreed, I get my bill and see a battery for $200 something, luckily I had the money what if I hadn't, same situation when I was quoted $175 for key replacement get there and told $500,,,,, THIS PRACTICE IS WRONG! Then I ask to speak to manager Roland (I believe) he's nowhere to be found, called him several times not able to leave a message, left a verbal message and to this day no call return! I'll never recommend this place or buy another vehicle from here!",1.8
26,"November 20, 2017",I went into the dealership just to compare prices with another dealership in another town.  The salesman and manager went above and beyond to work a deal and get me to purchase the new Yukon XL which is the car of my dreams.  I am turned 60 years old this year and I forsee this as being the last car I will ever purchase since all three of my other yukon/suburbans have lasted over 10 years each!,4.8
27,"November 10, 2017",I used to really love this dealership but now they are just going down hill in the customer service department and also doing things in a timely fashion. Crappy service being given to customers by reps and managers seems to be the new thing with this dealership. Sad. The only reason I didn’t have a complete horrible experience with this dealership the last time I took my car to get checked is because there are still reps like Anna who care about giving great customer service and trying her hardest to do anything she can to make sure the customer leaves happy.,1.0
28,"October 31, 2017",Comfortable waiting area with option for regular shuttle to nearby dining and shopping. Anna is the best--helpful and professional. Worth the 40 minute drive to return to the dealer for service.,4.8
29,"July 22, 2017",The dealership took 2 months to replace break pads on my vehicle due to staff forgetting to order the break pads and the staff lied about the condition of my tires and breaks. ,1.0
30,"June 21, 2017",very poor service department ! will never go there again..made a apointment did not do the work at all.your teck could not do the recll on the car.,1.3
31,"May 30, 2017","I am very impressed with the service I was provided.  Their personnel are knowledgeable, professional and very interested in pleasing the customer.  I found that everyone from service writer to parts are extremely courteous and professional.    . That is refreshing to see! ",5.0
