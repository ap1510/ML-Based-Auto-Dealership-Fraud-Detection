The only reason I gave them 1 Star was the sales staff at the used lot was wonderful. The finance department is where the problems are. Gary in finance is one of the worst human beings I have ever met. My son is in his 20’s and starting out. He bought a truck from them but wanted to keep his payments low so he wasn’t in over his head. Gary was very insistent he purchase an extended warranty that he couldn’t afford even though the vehicle had very low miles. When he wouldn’t buy the warranty when everything was done and signed you could tell Gary was mad.  He began insulting my son. Saying looks like your mom is going to be making your truck payments. And that since he wouldn’t buy the warranty that the truck was going to break down and that his mom would be the one paying to fix it. He was very demeaning and insulting. Instead of leaving happy and excited about buying his first vehicle for himself. He left depressed and beat down.",1.0

9,"August 09, 2019","Contacted the dealership on Weds of this week due to search on Autotrader and found a demo Jeep Grand Cherokee with the exact color and option packages I have been looking for.  Great deal at $50k.  Got a reply from Blake Black and emailing back and forth, until the emails from him stopped at 5:44pm.  Called dealership next morning and found out he was out of the dealership for the day and spoke with Chris Green.  Great guy, nice attitude.  Had Charlie their salesperson back in touch with me in minutes and we went back and forth finally arriving with a deal on trade-in and purchase of new Jeep.  Great!  Credit application completed, I signed the proposed deal sheet and was extremely pleased.  Until the next morning at 9:30am when Mr. Black returned my call and started asking odd questions about the deal, what were the terms, who was I dealing with.  Started to feel this was not going to be a great experience.  It was not.  Now wants $4000 more for a demo vehicle at end of model year.  Told him I would not like to work with him but would work with Charlie or Chris.  He proceeded to tell me that he was the SALES MANAGER and even if I was dealing with Charlie or Chris I would not get any better deal.  I ask for his boss and he said it was the owner and he would ""see if he could call me"".   Charlie called shortly later and apologizes profusely for ""his mistake"".  I have a lot of family that lives in Cleburne, Burleson, Godley, Joshua.  Gonna make sure they all know this is not a dealer to work with.",1.4

12,"September 30, 2017","Went in to test drive a Grand Cherokee, left with a 2018 Challenger. Steve Wooten is a wonderful man to work with when buying a vehicle. ",5.0
13,"September 16, 2017","Steve Wooten helped me with my vehicle purchase.   He was courteous, knowledgeable Nd willing to listen to what I really wanted in a truck.  I am pleased to say I got more than expected and Steve took his time with me and got the deal done.  I highly recommend this man to sell any vehicle he will definitely help you.  Luis in finance explained everything to me also.  He took the time to explain the paperwork and answered all my questions.  
Thanks Steve for all your help and patience.

14,"September 07, 2017",I had a great experience at Lone Star. They had the car that I wanted at the best price in the Metroplex. Tristan in sales and Luis in Finance made my shopping experience quick and easy. I live in Dallas and still come down to Lone Star to do business and have my vehicles serviced.,5.0
15,"May 11, 2017","Morgan Emigh sold me a Ram Rebel and this was absolutely the easiest, fastest, best vehicle purchase ever!!! I found the truck I wanted online, told him how much I wanted for my trade-in and literally purchased the vehicle within a day! I was in and out of the dealership in an hour and half! I would definitely recommend this salesman and dealership if you are looking for a no haggle purchase.",5.0
16,"September 19, 2016","The complete dealership is super nice, great, but not pushy sales personal. Juan A was very knowledgeable, and he is the reason we returned the next day, and bought a Jeep Cherokee. Thank you for a great experience. ",5.0
17,"June 03, 2016","My opinion is that basically,   if you are not in the hot demographics as a client,     at least I may have been washed out as an unimportant trade.    When I owned at the least one Dodge continuously since 1966,   and previously loved my Dodges.    But for no more than a few hundred dollars,   dispute on my $2500.00 (useless I see it)  Warranty Forever package....with 3 trips to LoneStar to fix one tiny fuel leak light,    they could not or did not fix the first times....when the chips were down the service department failed me,   openly willing to terminate such a long Dodge loyalty.     For their own inability to fix one tiny light in the course of no more than one k miles driven,   whereas the vehicle I bought for my use set on their lot for weeks in total.   I smiled over the many weeks;   they gave up on satisfaction so now I do on them as well,   where it took much for me to give up on Dodge  since 1966.    In my opinion,   as of course all of the above is,    as some of the days and over a week at a time they kept my truck,     they may have wanted to teach me a lesson....to not bother them with their mistakes.    I paid.",1.8
18,"April 03, 2016",This is my third truck that I have bought from Mr Wooten and I am very pleased.  He takes his time to find the truck that I want and makes sure I am pleased with it before I leave.    He also doesn't play around with your time or money . One of the best salesman around.

21,"February 12, 2015","We have bought 2 vehicles from this dealership and both times we used Steve Wooten. He is great, straight forward, loves to joke, makes you feel comfortable, and not high pressuring. I would recommend him to anyone looking to buy!",5.0
22,"May 10, 2014",Recently went in search of a dependable used car for my 80 yr old mother.  We found a perfect match for her at Lone Star.  Juan Arreola worked with us through the whole process.  Juan was professional and beyond pleasant to work with.  The process was smooth and we were quite happy both with our deal and the professionalism of those we dealt with at the dealership.  We only had one issue with the sale and Lone Star quickly proposed a generous solution to our concern.  I wouldn't hesitate recommending this dealership to any of my friends in search of a used or new vehicle.  And I'd certainly suggest they seek out Juan if they do visit the dealership.  It was a pleasure working the deal with him.,5.0
23,"December 01, 2010","I bought my car from Lone Star autoplex in Cleburne Texas one year ago. This dealership is very friendly and helpful until you have a problem. They claim that will take care of any needs you have when it comes to service on your car, I have yet to see it. They will leave you high and dry with a big mess to clean up.",1.0
