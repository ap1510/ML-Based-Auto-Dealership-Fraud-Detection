1,"May 16, 2019","I had the best experience in purchasing my New Buick Encore because of the excellent Salesman, Chris Hartley. He found the exact car that I wanted and the exact color that I wanted. He went above and beyond what you would think that a Salesman would do to help you have the best experience in purchasing a vehicle. He made sure that I received all the incentives that were offered by GM and the Dealership so that I would have the payment amount that I could afford.

I highly recommend Dow Autoplex here in Mineola, where I have purchased my last few vehicles. I would encourage you, if you are thinking about a new vehicle, to visit Dow and ask for Chris Hartley. I assure you that he will make your buying experience a pleasure.",5.0
