0,"February 22, 2020","UPDATE: After the bad experience over the weekend, Monday Martin Carbajal, new car sales manager reached out and asked for a chance to make the situation right.  He offered to provide a drive-out price as requested and went the extra mile to put together an acceptable quote and even sent a sales order showing the price details. My son chose to pursue the offer because of price and the ""warranty forever"". He purchased the car Monday night with Martin's help.  Martin really stepped up, genuinely apologizing for the situation and worked hard to correct the bad experience and turned it around.  I appreciate Martin pushing to convert what was a disappointing exchange into a satisfying transaction. The dealer won't get 5 stars because the situation should never have happened but Martin did turn it around and HE deserves 5 stars.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: I recommended my son to a Shell Federal Credit Union ""preferred"" dealership, DeMontrond Kia and have come to regret the whole experience.  DeMontrond Kia had a Sorento listed via Cars.com that was listed less than any other EX models on the site @ $28,712. He went to the dealership with an approval letter from the Credit Union.  When he arrived, the salesperson he met was very nice but said that was the maximum lowest price with all available rebates and incentive deals and that the car price for my son was actually $33,500. They left the dealership having felt ""baited and switched"".  Later the same day, I submitted an online request for a price and was emailed by the Internet Manger of the dealership Thom R. asking how he could help. I explained my son's experience and asked for a drive-out price on the specific car stock # if indeed the advertised Cars.com price was NOT actually the price. He responded with an excuse that the ""price you saw earlier was a mistake where the website was using all available rebates and actually double dipping one of the rebates."" He then listed the pricing of the car with available rebates and incentives with a drive-out price of $29,112. I noticed that my son would not qualify for the Loyalty discount of $1500 and asked if he would still honor the drive-out price of $30,612. He replied that ""Yes all they would lose is the $1,500 owner loyalty. So yes $30,612 Drive out."" I replied that the pricing was acceptable for the specific stock number at the stated drive-out price of $30,612 and asked how we needed to secure the car. He offered that he could come do the paperwork and take the car and they would finish with the Credit Union on Monday. I replied that He would head to the dealership and thanked him for making the earlier bad experience right again. At almost the same time I was replying, he replied that ""I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs the sell price of $30,612 plus TT&l"". I replied that I had asked for the drive-out price at the beginning and that he himself had referenced ""drive-out"" price twice in our email exchange. I asked him to honor the price he had quoted as drive-out but he refused. I plan to submit a request to have this dealership removed from my Credit Union's preferred dealer list.  If the list indeed exists to provide customers with dealers committed to an honest car-buying experience and not ""pay to play"", I am hopeful they will be removed. I was forced to select 1 star, they deserved NONE.",4.3
1,"February 06, 2020",Hi again- I wrote an email immediately to the address provided and have not heard back. Do you think perhaps you could prod them to respond?  The email I sent is regarding a 250 deductible sent 2/4 (I‚Äôve also checked my junk folder just in case.)  You see the used car I purchased needed to have some body work done and I didn‚Äôt notice the damage before I pulled the trigger on the purchase.  I would like to think you guys would stand behind your product and reimburse me for just that deductible portion.  Otherwise I would advise buyers to look for used cars via other dealers.  Hoping to hear something today.,2.0
2,"May 20, 2019","Salesperson Ernesto was great. Assisted with purchase of 2019 Forte. The maintenance/service dept. has turned out to be a whole nother animal tho. Was rudely spoken to by the first guy who claimed his name was ""Mark"", then when I asked his last name, he simply hung up in my face. Called back, but this time spoke with a lady named Kaci who was also rude, but irritatingly subtle with hers. Maybe cause its Monday??ü§∑üèΩ??? Dont know. But these people could use a lesson on customer service. Or some coffee.",1.0
3,"October 02, 2017","Do not buy a vehicle from Demontrond. You should not be disrespected and lied to when giving a business tens of thousands of dollars for a brand new vehicle. You are much better off going to a dealership that specializes in their one brand of vehicle, not a megahub like Demontrond where they sell Volkswagen, Kia, motor homes, etc., and run you through their impersonal facility like cattle.

Do not be fooled by their ""Warranty Forever"" program, as the requirements are strict and easily broken.

Do not buy a vehicle from George ""Country"" Hobbs. He will call to arrange for other dealerships in the area not to have your desired vehicle available to you just so that he can be the person to make the commission. He will become visibly angry when the negotiation process is not to his liking. He will talk down to you and blame you for long wait times in front of other employees and customers. He will have you wait two additional hours just to pay for the vehicle because he failed to tell the finance office that you are paying cash instead of financing. Mr. Hobbs will take the keys to your vehicle to his home and have you waiting again at the dealership for him to arrive and fill the gas and attach the temporary plates before you can finally drive away with the vehicle that you signed paperwork for and that he has had in his possession since two days prior.

I have never been in the position to spend this much money and be treated so poorly and I will not ever recommend anyone attempt to have their needs met by Demontrond.",1.0
4,"June 07, 2017",Where can I fucking begin? i don't know how these people are still in business. They literally had my car for over a month and it was like I was working for them for free. They did not call me at all for any updates on my car like they said they would. I had to keep burning gas just to go check on my car. They were very unprofessional with their service. My car went in under warranty for a power steering issue and they did not fix what they were suppose to. This dealership is straight (0 ratings) for me. They treat their customers like shit and all of their representatives had an attitude. I would strongly recommend anyone to take their business some where else because this dealership is straight SHITS. They definitely won't see any purchase from me anything ever. Have a HELL life with your shitty service.,1.0

6,"November 05, 2016","We worked with Al both over the phone and in person.  He is so professional, yet an obviously caring and kind person.  We had dealt with him previously and he remembered us.  He involved a manager, Chris, when we started discussing the best deal we could get.  Chris was also good to work with.  The other dealership withdrew their previous offer to beat any deal offered by DeMontrond by $500, so we know we got an excellent deal.  Things were explained to us thoroughly by the gentleman in finance (sorry I can't remember his name).  The young man who went over the features in the car with us was knowledgeable and never rushed us.  I have dealt with Clint in the past in the service and he is also great to work with.  DeMontrond will have our business in the future when it is time.  Thank you!!",5.0
7,"September 01, 2016","I to had a scheduled appointment for oil change, I checked my vehicle in with Clint.. The service guy Clint very unprofessional did  not come to me but I had to approach him after 1 hour and 20 min wait and ask him what was taking so long. Clint told me that I had 2 nails in my tire and they would be addressing this situation and get back with me. After almost 3 hours of waiting to get an oil change my vehicle is still not ready. The service guys never once offered me the free shuttle service anywhere. Clint walks around helping others and never get back to me regarding my vehicle. I have always after bringing my car to Demontrond Kia North Frwy for 1 year been treated bad by these service guys including the service Manager at Demontrond Kia. It's just unfair with this WARRANTY FOREVER that we have to bring our vehicle back to the same location every time and receive the same bad/unprofessional treatment and nothing changes. I just wonder what the connection is with the customers that receive the unprofessional/bad service from the service department at DEMONTROND KIA NORTH FRWY.. A FEW OF THE SERVICE GUYS INCLUDING THE SERVICE MANAGER NEED TO TAKE A CLASS IN CULTURAL DIVERSITY. ",1.4
8,"June 30, 2016","Buying a car is rarely fun, but often times a necessity in life. I came to the DeMontrond dealership with an idea of what I wanted, and not only was the sales rep extremely helpful and friendly; but he found me the perfect vehicle that met all of my expectations. It was actually a very rewarding experience and I drove away knowing that I had gotten a really nice vehicle at a very reasonable price. Will definitely be using this salesman for all my future purchases. Dealership was extremely neat and clean and everyone had a kind word to say...Most impressive in this day and age! ",5.0
9,"June 30, 2016","My parents are retirees, fixed income...I'm sure you all know the drill.

My mother found herself in the hospital for a week and wouldn't you know it, while my dad is driving back and forth from the house to the hospital their car broke down...repairs were more than the car was worth so in the midst of all of that, Dad had to figure out how to buy a car.

have no fear! Demontrond is here! 

I called Adam, who had helped my wife and I with a VW purchase, and within a couple hours, my dad had a brand new Kia at a lower rate than he walked in hoping for. 

Adam took care of everything so that all dad had to do was show up and sign the forms after taking a quick look at the car.

Just like my VW experience, everyone was so very helpful, so very enthusiastic, so laid back and relaxed about the whole situation. No hardsales, no pressure...as far as they were concerned, my father and I had other things to worry about so they were going to make the car as easy as possible.

Demontrond likes to say home of warranty forever but as far as I'm concerned they are home of my family's business forever.

Big thanks to Adam and to the dealership for their excellent service and support.",5.0
10,"June 24, 2016",I had an appointment for an oil change and when I got here I was told it would be an hour to an hour and a half. Here I am two hours later still waiting on my car. I don't understand why it is taking this long to change oil and why they'd tell me times that aren't true. Very disappointed. Won't be coming back here,2.0
11,"April 28, 2016","I received excellent customer service. I just got 2016 Kia Soul, it flooded. The sales representative was curious and knowledgeable. I was able to come back from a total loss, and walk away with my new Kia.
I would just like to thank the people at Demontrond for a job well done. Its people like you that give people like me hope.",5.0
12,"August 25, 2015","Spoke to George 3 times on the phone and each time I requested a e-mail price quote.  ""It's on its way"" every time.  Funny part-- 2nd time didn't remember the car I was interested in purchasing but miraculously he had ""hidden"" one for me earlier that day.  We have always had great dealings with Demontrond in the past, what a disappointment.  No wonder you have a ""1"" rating.I'm moving on and taking my business elsewhere.....",1.0
13,"January 05, 2015","I arrived at Demontrond for a 9 am appointment to get new tires. While waiting I was told they didn't have my tires, then he quickly returned to say they did have them. He gave me my price and I waited around for them to finish my vehicle. He returned an hour and a half later to say they didn't have my tires and that they would bring my car back to the front. AN HOUR AND A HALF!!!! I asked to speak to the manager, who took his time coming to the front to help. I let him know what happened and how long I had to wait for no service. He had a smile on his face the entire time and responded by saying ""Do you want me to order the tires for you?"" No apology for me having to wait around that long for nothing. And you believe I will be returning to try to get tires from you again? Not happening EVER!!!! That was not the only bad experience that I've had from them but it will be the last. (-5 STARS)",1.0
14,"June 11, 2014","I talked to Justin Demontrond Kia on Friday 06/06 and he placed an order for me amount of $55.68 for 6 tiny bolts 3/8 inchx1/2 inch that holds the torque convereter to the flywheel which where supposed to be delivered to me on Tuesday and i paid since I am renting a car I paid 20$ extra for overnight delivery.

I called Demontrond Kia on Wednesday and asking about my part, when it gonna be delivered? they said that the order had been placed on Friday 6/6 but until today Tuesday 6/11 they don't know when my bolts gonna be shipped to them. hahahaha what a real car dealer lol lol lol

so I told joe parts department Demontrond Kia that I paid 20$ for rushing the order sothat I save 26$/day for car rental, anyway I told him please cancel my order and give me back my money since it looks like you guys don't know what you are doing so that's what he said:
I cant cancel the order you already paid and if you want your money you have to come and get it.

I called my bank explained to them what happened and cancled the visa card transaction. I eneded up ordering the same order 
from COWBOY KIA of CONROE for $23.04 including overnight delivery.
what a joke to order from those guys. haha ",1.0
15,"March 17, 2014","Once someone finally came to help me, I immediately regretted the decision to come here. The guy who came to help me was so rude! All he cared about was my credit score, and I'd only been taking to him for a minute! Didn't care to show me any cars, just wanted to talk about my personal finances, he seemed like a snake in the grass! I told him financing wouldn't be an issue and that I just wanted to test drive an Optima but he still went on and on. I think this guy must have been deaf. Long story short, I left after 3 min of him talking at me and I bought my Kia elsewhere and I'm so happy I did!!!!",1.3
16,"May 26, 2011","went in for a ck engine light on. told that it was the air filter!!!the air filter is clean and new. they didnt fix it. that in itself is not so bad.  Upon close inspection of the car i found that they went thru my glove box, tried to steal a chrome trim piece i installed on the shifter, damaging it. the plastic engine cover was not tightened correctly and they scratched the window frame on the drivers door. I dont want to ever have to deal with such a bad place. Given the attitude of the staff I find it pointless to attempt to go back and address this issues with the management. As a consumer however I can only warn other customers of the dangers of dealing with this kind of element.
I am not the type to complaint or make a scene or anything but this kind of behavior denotes a rampant disregard for costumers property and a seriuos lack of integrity on the service personel.",1.5
