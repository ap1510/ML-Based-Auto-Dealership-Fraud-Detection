3,"April 22, 2016","I went here looking for a Mazda CX-5. I wanted a certian color with specific options and they did not have one on the lot. Jeff and Tammy where extremely helpful with locating the car I was looking for and getting it to me super fast.

The price was great and the service was great. I will be definitely be back next time I am in the market for a new car.",5.0
4,"August 31, 2014","I was hesitant to step onto a dealership car lot because I expected a high pressure sales pitch.  I wanted to test drive a Mazda CX 5 to see how it handled.  There was a great looking dark blue model on the lot.  Jeff approached us and told us to go ahead and take it for a spin after he made a copy of my license.  When we were done, I told him that I was impressed with the car but not ready to commit.  He was very laid back and gave me his card. A few days later he emailed me with a great offer.  The deal was done that day which coincidently was the day before my birthday!",5.0
