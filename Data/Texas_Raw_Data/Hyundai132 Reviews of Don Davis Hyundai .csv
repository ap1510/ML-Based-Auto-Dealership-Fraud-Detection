0,"January 07, 2020","AWFUL SERVICE. I WIL NEVER USE THEM AGAIN!  I have bought 5 vehicles from the Lake Jackson store. Loved them. The last vehicle I bought used. It has been heck every since day one. I received the vehicle and was told they would replace the missing remote to the dvd system. After purchasing the used sales manager said his friend owned the car so he will get it from them. Then never called me back. When I called, he said no they didnt have it and wont replace it. First lie. Then just at a year later, my car started having issues starting. The push button just clicked. Checked the battery all was good. Took it in. They had it all day. The guy, Matthew, said the recall on my car was not what was the problem. If my brake isnt messing up, just dont worry about it. I'm sorry, isnt the recall supposed to be replaced BEFORE the problem comes up? When I came back, he couldnt find my key. When we went looking, the service guy said that the dude never brought him my car. Took about 45 minutes of looking. Had 3 guys searching for my car I dropped off. My mother finally walked in the back and found it. It was unlocked. The service guy was shocked and said it was policy to keep them locked. I spoke my voice to the man at the front. I demanded to speak to manager. By then in tears of frustration I explain it all. He finds my key and was very nice. Hooked my car up the next morning and he said nothing is showing on the computer that is wrong. If it doesnt do it to him, they cant fix it. Sent me home. That next evening I had to go to Houston. My car refused to start and I could not get home. Took about 2 hours to get started while stuck with my sick child at texas childrens valet parking garage in the middle of a dark area. Kinda scary for a mom and young girl alone. Brought my car back to them that next day- So after being super mad, he clean everything to try that. He drives it to front. As soon as I get in to start it, it does the not starting thing. I run and find him and the service guy. It does it for them. They said he would call in the morning and order the part for the recall and try that. I told him the other guy said it's on backorder and the company isnt making it. He looked confused and said no, and infact I'm pretty sure they provide a rental while we fix it. The next day, never heard from the manager.  I waited another day and called myself to follow up. He forgot to call me but the part is here. Ugh. Drop it off and it gets replaced but now my car makes a squealing noise. He tells me drive it about 3 or 4 weeks and let him know if the problem continues. I do so. Again, not starting. Called to speak to Mike, the manager. David says he is busy and explains they cant fix something that isnt showing a read on the computer. It has to do it for them. I explain it does it for Mike. Said sorry, it has to fire a read on computer. I asked to speak to mike again. He said he would have him call. I call back to speak to him, when transferred, the phone is picked up by someone and I can here the racket in the background and then it hangs up on me. Call a third time, he says mike is on lunch. Mike never called me back. I'm stuck in Houston with a car that wont start and a dealership that refuses to speak to me or fix the problem. I will NEVER buy another car from them. Nor will any of my family. I DO NOT recommend this dealership to anyone. When something is too hard, they give up on you.",1.0
1,"July 09, 2019","My husband and I purchased a new car October, 2018. It was a 2018 Hyundai Sonata. There were some miscommunications about the features on the car. There were two salespeople that sold us the car. We didnt know there was no cd player and a couple of other things that weren't explained to us We talked with the salespeople about our concerns. They both apologized. My husband and I wanted to talk with the manager to let him know we weren't quite satisfied with the explanations of features on the car. We went to Don Davis in Lake Jackson to meet with the manager. His name was Mr. Neo at the time. Mr. Neo meet us outside the car lot building. He never invited us into the building. We just purchased a new car from your company. My husband and I explained what happened to Mr Neo. He said  he was sorry and walked off. We have never been treated so RUDE and DISRESPECTFUL. We're both are senior citizens just trying to find out features on the car and how they work. There were other customers and sale people standing around looking at what had happened.  Some of the salespeople did say thank you for your business. We will never purchase a car from Don Dearlership Again. It was a bad experience for the both of us.

13,"October 28, 2017","This dealership will advertise a low internet price but they don't want to honor it.

Or, better yet, go to another dealership.",3.0

When I took the car home that I had bought I had regrets that I should have bought the car I own today because of the extra features. I called the dealer the next day to ask them if could switch cars to get the car with better options. They told me no problem,  I drove back and re-did the financing documents.

129,"April 23, 2015","My mother brought in her Hyundai for service and after she departed she noticed service light on dash which was not on when she left car. She called service department and it was stated that they would not have returned car to her with light on as if the light turned on after she left. She brought vehicle back the next morning after a very long evening of concern (she is widowed and on fixed income) and it was discovered that the service technician did not put sensor back in correctly. I had an appointment the next day to have my oil changed and mentioned incident to the service person who dealt with my mother and he was very unapologetic and rude!!!! I would not complain if had happened to myself but the fact that this man insinuated that the service indicator light could not have been on when she left, which caused my mother distress, and it was thief fault completely unnerves me. I hope that other customers and their elderly customers especially get treated better than my mother has.",2.2
130,"October 05, 2014","Had attempted to buy a new Sonata from Don Davis recently. Thought buying locally would be beneficial to both of us.

Their sell price was over $1,000 higher than a close-by Houston dealership on the same model,  The ""sales mgr"" that day wouldn't negotiate and also had nothing but disparaging things to say about the price from the other dealership, and the dealership itself.

I found the rival to be much more welcoming and ready to sell a car, so that's who got my business. Don Davis seems to cagey about having VINs available for comparison, too. I had to get them from the vehicles themselves
I don't put much faith in DEALER supplied invoices.",2.4
131,"May 02, 2014","this place didn't even try to work out a deal. I tried to buy local but they didn't care. I was given a high price and then was asked what do I expect to pay. I told him they said no way. I showed him prices on internet he laughed and said they are lying. He then called one of the dealerships to make sure. He told me "" to drive to Houston to find out for myself. And when i found out they are lying and try to come back to don davis his price was staying the same. like or not!!"" I had to drive to Ron Carter Hyundai to but a car.  I'm guessing the sales manager at don davis is a lye, because i bought a brand new hyundia sonata hybrid limited for the price i wanted.",1.0
