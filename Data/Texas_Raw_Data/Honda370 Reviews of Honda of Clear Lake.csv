0,"March 06, 2020","Poor workmanship in the service center. $5,700. was spent and the ‚Äútechnician‚Äù left off bolts, improper gasket sealing, and a return trip to fix it so they could try to rip me off some more. Now I have some new rattles, oil leak still there but not nearly as bad, and where the heck are my valve stem covers? I will order another set from NFL website. I am a woman who has no problem getting a little grease under my acrylic nails, and businesses like Clear Lake Honda is why. My vehicle is my office, and I spent a lot of money making sure my office is able to continue going down the road (vehicle maintenance). This place will not be seeing me or my office again. Of course, in years past my office has been a Toyota, a Nissan, and a couple of Hyundai‚Äôs.  I heard wonderful things about the Honda CRV when it was time to buy another vehicle. It probably was a good vehicle, when I purchased it. Pretty sure it won‚Äôt be from here on out. Expensive lesson learned. Save yourself, go somewhere else to have ANY work done. ",1.0

I wish I can rate 0 stars but everyone still nice except ‚ÄúInternet Manager name is Steve Bramlett‚Äù
I went to dealership today to buy the Honda Odyssey 2020. We looking online and he supported to help us. But when we came and deal with him just 2 times he sooo such and sooo rude to us. Telling customer waste his time? Is it manages of sellman can say? Some ‚Äúrude‚Äù words but I can‚Äôt tell... 
If anyone think to buy new car please stay away this manager name... seriously.",1.0

4,"August 09, 2019","I recently purchased a used car for my son, and the management made this the worst car buying experience in my life. First off, I have to compliment the sales associates, Andre Adolph and Rochan Morgan, for truly assisting me in and my son in this process. They worked effectively as a team to close the deal, and they took a genuine interest in my son. Andre even contacted me weeks after I purchased the car to check on my son after having a surgical procedure. Also, Blaine Lushute was very kind, warm, and considerate during the closing/financing. These gentlemen are the ONLY REASON I went through with this purchase. However, the manager, David MCDuffie, was the most inconsiderate, arrogant, discourteous and disrespectful person I have ever come across in sales. He is also dishonest. He reneged on an agreement to make a minor repair, blamed the ordeal on the sales associate, and actually told me, ""If you are finding cars at other locations, maybe you should buy one there."" I have never been so repulsed at a sales associate in my life. The only reason I opted to purchase the car from this location is how hard the sales associates worked to close the deal, and how Mr. Lushute swooped in and cleaned up the mess made by Mr. McDuffie. I honestly can't say if I would recommend this dealership or not because they truly have some good people working there, but some, I'm not sure why. I also just read some older reviews, and other customers have made the same complaints. Why is he still able to treat customers in this manner?  Had I had a different sales manager, I likely would be writing a completely different review. My son likes his car, but the stress we went through to get it was much more than I ever expected to endure. ",1.8
5,"August 05, 2019",Mark worked very hard for me to see that I found the right vehicle and financing to meet my current needs.  He even delivered the car to my home when I said I would need to find a friend to bring me to pick it up.,5.0
6,"July 22, 2019",Though I don‚Äôt work for this dealership anymore I‚Äôm sure that somewhere out there there may be a better Honda dealership but at Honda of Clear Lake you get honesty and integrity.

7,"July 02, 2019","While waiting for diagnostics to be completed on my wife‚Äôs Honda CRV, which was quickly determined to be a defective battery, we inquired about newer CRV‚Äôs. Sales agent brought one around for our inspection and deal was done professionally, courteously and pleasantly. Wife and I had an enjoyable and ‚Äúno stress‚Äù experience from start to finish and drove out smiling behind the wheel of a new car. Job well done, Team Honda!  Things like this have us looking forward to our golden anniversary coming up later this year.

8,"June 05, 2019","This is a review for the Service Department and Carlos Shelton.

What should have been a routine 45 minute oil-change turned into an all day affair where my car was broken - not once - but twice by the mechanics. Then instead of an apology when they finally fixed what they had broken, they tried to bill ME for the parts they had broken in their negligence. 

I brought my car in at 8:20 in the morning for an oil-change. I was then told by Carlos Shelton that my car needed two new air filters and ball joint boots. I asked how long this would take because I had a busy day planned, and he told me 45 minutes. I said okay. The cost would have been around $300.

After an hour, Carlos comes back to tell me they were unable to change the boots unless I was willing to pay $1,000 now. I declined, paid for my filters that were changed, and started to drive away. A mechanic had to physically stop me from driving away and explained that they had damaged my car and it was now unsafe to drive. Carlos was happy to let me leave, however, regardless of my safety. When the mechanic kept reinforcing to Carlos that it was unsafe, he begrudgingly agreed to get his manager so they could fix what they had damaged. I was then told it would be another hour. So I waited.

Carlos came back after another hour showing me some damaged part that was now broken in an attempt to fix what they had originally damaged. He said my newly broken part wasn't in stock and couldn't be here until after 2:00. He offered to shuttle me home. I was then told by the shuttle driver that he was supposed to hurry, not make me wait, and be kind to me because they ""had totally messed up my car."" 

Once home, I was never called for an update, so around 4:00, I finally called Carlos who informed me that my car was now ready for pick up. No apology, mind you. I explained I needed to wait for my husband to get home from work so I would have a way there. We arrived at the service center at about 5:45. Carlos had gone home. I was presented with a bill for the parts they had damaged. When they got Carlos on the phone he said he would not release my car until I paid. I asked to speak to a manager, and was told they had all gone home. It was only 6 pm. They don't close until 9 pm., but apparently absolutely no manager was on duty. (I find this hard to believe.) Carlos said I could pay now and have my car, or I could wait until the morning in order to speak to someone about getting my car - that they had broken twice - and were now holding hostage- back in to my possession. 

Instead of an apology, I received a bill and hostility. I was shocked. I was shocked to the point that it seemed surreal that this was really happening. After finding another service representative and being told again that no managers were on duty (how can that be, really?) - I explained the situation, showed him my receipts for paying for what I had consented to, and having several names of employees who could vouch for the fact that my car had been damaged repeatedly by them - he finally gave me my keys and told me I could go. I cried the whole way home.

Still no apology. It has been two days. No call from the Service Center or Carlos to try to make this right. It is clear Honda has no respect for it's customers. I have had a Civic, an Accord, and an Element from this dealership. Never again. I was shocked when I saw this dealership had a one star rating on several sites. But the one star is well-earned and deserved. Avoid this place, unless you want to pay for their mistakes and possibly drive home in a vehicle that may compromise your and your family's safety. They could care less about ethics or your well-being, as long as they make their commission.",1.4
9,"May 22, 2019","This dealership adds in-house costs to new cars through their addendums.  These dealer add-ons increase the price way over their value. After the sale, someone cut the addendum off our sticker so that we wouldn't even know what we paid extra for.  The addendum was laminated to the sticker,so it was a deliberate attempt to deceive when someone took a pair of scissors and cut the addendum off and kept it.",1.0
10,"April 15, 2019",I bought Honda Accord them they didn't give me Military Discount. Especially Finance department was very awful. They didn't finance me with Honda and had with the other  banks with higher APR to get commission. They came up with different coverages that you don't need. They try to reap you up from every possible way. They will  try to add the coverage that is already covered by manufactures warranty. I referred one of my friend to buy Honda Accord from them just because Hondas being a good car but didn't give a referral. Very upset with this dealer,1.4
11,"February 09, 2019",Do not go to this dealership!  They lie and cheat you out of every cent they can!  They tried to rip me off and sell my loan with no warranty on a brand new car!  BEWARE!!! If I could give them a negative rating I would!,1.0
12,"February 06, 2019","Buyers beware. The sales people me and my wife encountered and the extent that they will go to in an attempt to decieve by omission is sickening the sales manager bennet johnson is a lier he uses calling card tactics to lure folks in to clearlake honda then once there flips on you and of course its more money in the dealers favor we left i told my wife he would call before we got home and he did. My wife is deaf / hearing impaired and also an amazing lady that only tried to deal in good faith and not only did that dealership get caught trying to wrap up their dirty scam they interupted my wife at her place of employeement and tried to co cover up their serious scam .they sent their finance guy to finish off and cover up their scam gone wrong. They thought they were gonna get away with charging us 18,780.37 for a 39 month extended warranty that covers little of nothing . has anyone ever heard of such nonsence and to boot thats for a brand new hrv that has a bumper to bumper warranty for the entirety of the 36 month lease. So 36 mo.lease on a brand new hrv. And a 39 mo. Extended warranty that is 100% unnecessary for 18,780.37 .and then they financed 26880.14 total. They were supposed to give us 12,000 credit on our 2016 honda fit which they are still advertising on their web site for 15 grand .days after we picked it up .they took our first payment on the hrv the day we picked it up almost 2 weeks ago and we still dont have our money back .the sales mgr. Bennet johnson burned up my phone for days with his pleading text .folks beware of this dealership and their 18,780.37 / 39 months extended warranty on their already covered bumper to bumper floor planed Honda's as well i could go on but this certainly paints a true story of deception by omission and rediculas lies and hassle beyond the norm .i can only warn people of the schemes and scams taking place their as they relate to us me and my wife .BUYER BEWARE.

15,"January 20, 2019","I came in as a repeat buyer. I previously owned and bought a brand new accord from clear lake Honda. I‚Äôve had two brand new cars since then and wanted to trade my one yr old ford SUV in for an accord. 
I came in, test drive and found the car i wanted. They plugged my trade in into their system and offered me below KBB and would not budge. I owed about what they should give me for it.  Upset i left. I paid 6k towards my ford and dropped the loan down 6k. Went back exactly three months later and tried again. Because i didn‚Äôt want to go upside on my loan. Guess what. They offered me $7,500.00 less than the first trade in offer!!!! Said it was due to mileage. I drive a normal amount to and from work which is close to my home. No possible way they charge that much for mileage. The GM was very rude, snide and cocky. He could see how upset i was. My husband said for us to go eat and talk about it. The GM commented on how expensive he restaurant we were going to!!! I will never ever buy from here. They do not care about repeat business just try to rip you off any way they can. ",1.2

18,"December 05, 2018","I've read a bunch of reviews here and on other sites and I gotta tell you....don't go to any dealership unprepared. They are in business to make a profit, as they should. Almost every comment I've read about how somebody got ""ripped off"" could have been prevented if the person had done some homework. To that end, I did my research and knew exactly what I wanted. Steve Bramlett and Brandon Burke were my initial email and phone contacts. I also called and emailed several dealers in the Houston area and no one would do what Clear Lake Honda did. Brandon in particular busted his butt to get my wife and I exactly what we wanted, and at a more than fair price. And since we paid cash, Angel in Finance spent a total of 10 minutes with us filling out title paperwork and taking our cashier's check. That's it. No hard sell, no pressure. We also met briefly with Bennet, I believe a GM. I have never been treated with more respect and transparency than at this dealership, I highly recommend them. ",5.0
19,"November 18, 2018","Today, My father, my sister and I went to buy an Accord Sport  at this location and the way that they are doing business is not very honest.  The front line personal needs to be more ethic and think in the value of the customer. The first salesman "" Jesus""  that we met in the parking lot was very welcoming and tried to help us as much as he could, however, he was already with another customer and he had to send us another person who could help us. The other salesman who approached us made us feel that we were there only to see and not to buy. When we asked  him about a car that its was shown in the website for $24636, he responded that those cars did not include accessories or extra features and maybe we would need to request the car directly from the manufacturer. We understood and we requested him to see if he could search in the dealer inventory  the car that we were looking for, and he replied: ‚Äòwell if you are going to buy  we can see if we can negotiate and see what we have‚Äù. (We know that there is people who only goes to the dealerships to see , but you need to treat all your customers as they are your only buyers and if they are requesting you to check your inventory just do it , don‚Äôt condition). After re affirmed that we were buyers, the salesman‚Äôs attitude changed and showed us what we were looking for.
After that, my sister loved the car and the salesman gave us a price for $24636 written in a white paper and ‚Äúpre-approved‚Äù by finance. Obviously not including, taxes, title, and the additional costs. When we went to sign the final documents, I requested to read the final disclosure  as my father and sister only signed  without checking, and I noticed that the Car Cash price cost that it was documented was $27600 approx. not $24636 as we were told. I asked this advisor why and he made several excuses in different opportunities, as interest included, additional warranty included, gap, taxes, etc, However, they were disclosed  and added in the same document in the bottom part. I reviewed this document for about an hour, repeating him that the price negotiated was not in the actual document. That if the interest was included why it was twice,etc. At the end, I told him ‚Äú I know how to read the costs in the disclosures because I have an MBA‚Äù could you please explain me why the price is not shown? So, he changed the Car cash price cost and he replied, ‚Äúwe as dealerships we paid taxes and additional costs. I will deal with it‚Äù.  If you as a car dealership can‚Äôt give the prices that you are offering , don‚Äôt tell your customer that you will giving  them a price when at the end you will be charging whatever you want to unsuspected customers.  *We bought the car because we like it not because of the service received.

-Deshonestidad-
My hermana le encanto el Acord sport y despues de ir con el vendedor firmo un papel en donde el de finanzas aprovaba el costo final del carro en $24632, obviamente sin incluir taxes, garantias,etc.  
Cuando fuimos a firmar los ultimos documentos requeri revisarlos ya que mi papa y mi hermana solo habian firmado por firmar y no habian checado si el precio que habian dicho habia sido respetado. Cuando lei los documentos me di cuenta que el precio del carro lo habian puesto en mas de $27000 dolares y no $24632 como habian dicho. Le pregunte al de finanzas el porque y el ponia diferentes excusas como taxes, garantias, gap, intereses,etc. Lo que el no sabia es que podia entender el documento financier y la informacion que daba no concordaba con lo que estaba en el papel. Despues de una hora de estarle diciendo de que el precio del carro no concordaba con el precio que habian dicho, le dije se como leer el document de costos porque tengo una maestria en finanzas, me puedes decir porque no esta el precio acordado? Y el respondio; ‚Äú nosotros como agencias tenemos muchos costos, ya yo me encargare‚Äù
  Si van a comprar un auto y les dan un precio por favor vean que este precio este en el documento. NO SE DEJEN ENGANAR. En ese documento final va a venir el precio del auto mas las taxas, garantias, gap, etc.",1.2
20,"October 27, 2018","First off I sell new vehicles and used vehicles, I put an online credit application in for a used 15 civic here, I was told I had to put down 1500$ before they would submit my loan to a bank which is false because how would you know what I have to put down if the bank didn't tell you. They wouldn't tell me an interest rate or how much the total amount financed is, I do this everyday people and if you know how much money down I need you know my interest rate. The cost of the vehicle was 12,500 but the payments were 308 for 72 months with 1500 down. That is absurd. When the numbers don't add up it means you're getting ripped off.

I have had my new 2019 Ridgeline RTLT for 5 weeks. Got the extended warranties and maintenance plan.  The doors auto lock 75% of time.  They could not replicate problem after opening & closing door a few times , so it's my problem, not Honda's right??  They wouldn't do anything to try to fix this security issue.  I'm not knowledgeable about stuff like this, but I think maybe they could have tried to check battery in fob or maybe reprogram key fob, exchange for a new fob.

33,"August 24, 2017","We bought a new CRV on June 1, 2015 and asked our salesman if the 5 yr warranty we had bought the previous year on our 2009 Honda would transfer.  He told us not but they would refund us the unused portion.  The man in finance said both of our warranties had expired on mileage.  Which was not possible since our 2009 Honda only had 50000 miles when we traded it in on June 2015, a year after the first warranty would have expired in August 2014.  He said my next warranty had expired on mileage, that was impossible because it was less than a year old.  That gentleman also kept trying to sell us a 72,000 mile warranty on our new car, I told him repeatedly I wanted 60,000 miles.When I got home, he had changed some of the contract to 60,000 but some of it was 72,000 miles.  I complained on a comment letter that was sent and apparently it went to Honda.  My salesman, who we like and both of our last two cars from, called me and said Honda wanted me to come in and talk to the finance manager.  I ask for the manager but was sent a sales person from finance to tell me he was not available, could he help me.  So I explained the problem and looked at the computer and told me that the first warranty had expired on miles (not true) and the second one was only for a year and 36000 miles and had expired on miles.  First, it was for 5 years and 60,000 miles.  Even if it had been as he said, it had not been a full year and we had not put 15,000 miles in a year on the car.  As far as he was concerned that was the end of it. Maybe because we are older, they thought we wouldn't know any better.  By the way on the 2015 Honda that I have been driving since June 1, 2015, I only have just over 8,000 miles on the car.

34,"April 08, 2017","I was supposed to pay cash for a used car last December, but was convinced by finance officer to get a loan to build my credit. Then I was told I can only make 2k down payment for loan to be approved. Then he added 3 warranties totaling a little over $2000 WITHOUT INFORMING ME. 

I already complained (was told finance officer was no longer connected with them) and talked with Coxi. 2 of 3 warranties were canceled. Talked with GM and he did a good job reiterating it was my fault for signing loan agreement without double checking the fine print. Then I was given a hard time regarding the 3rd warranty. Still, he gave his word that amount for 3rd warranty will be reimbursed. This was early January and it is now April. Where is it??? 

It is indeed my fault for not checking the loan agreement. I live 90+ miles away, been there whole day and just wanted to go home and get the transaction over with and I trusted them. However, for the Honda of Clear Lake management to push the blame entirely on me must mean it's acceptable if I didn't notice it? Is this the moral standard you hold your employees to? A finance officer's job is clear-cut - it's to facilitate payment/loans and explain it to customers, including additional services and expenses isn't it? Having missed mentioning $2000+ worth of warranties added because there were too many things happening during that transaction is not an excuse when it is clearly part of his job.",1.0

36,"March 23, 2017","Thank you Coxy and Alberto for wasting my family's time! We started our day here 5 hrs ago after seeing an ad on multiple website. I called and confirmed a quote for the car and validated all detailed. I had my dad and brother meet me here so we could check out the vehicle . When we got there, the advertised mileage became 10K higher and the price increased by a grand for the exact same vehicle that I was quoted for earlier in the day. We were told a bunch of work had been done of the car and that is why the value went up. Funny they forgot to mention all of that on the phone. Also, funny that they didn't correct me when I mentioned the advertised mileage on the phone. Regardless of the BS, we came to an agreement on the price and the sales guys said they couldn't give us the price until the manager left and told us to come back a few hours later. We should have left at this point but didn't want all of the time and effort to go to waste so we waited. We came back a couple of hours later and the sales guys told us they would not honor the deal because the manager would see the deal sheet in the morning and be upset. Seriously, what the xxxx was the point of making us wait. 

I honestly don't think they folks wanted to make a real sale. They had no empathy for wasting over 5 hrs of our time only to give us a run-around. This is by no means how a professional dealership conducts business. During our 5 hrs here, we came across several sales people and managers and all of them should be re-trained to provide professional service. I am so furious right now that I want to personally contact someone at Honda Corporate and take this to the highest level possible. Being a long time Honda customer, this is the most disappointing experience I have ever had. I will NEVER do business with this dealership ever again and recommend that ANYONE looking for a Honda, visit any of the other major Honda dealers in the greater Houston area.

37,"February 07, 2017","Call the service department to see about a side airbag that went off for no reason while driving down the highway. Honda of Clear Lake was called specifically as they had done the factory recall work on the airbag issues a year ago (1/2016). Service clerk would not honor or look into issue without a diagnostic fee. The service department seemed to be putting up a wall and distancing themselves from this  work they had done in the past. I have had several cars in the past with airbags and not once has any of them have gone off without reason to. Bottom line is why did it go off for no reason? To find out why for my safety and the safety of my passengers. It appears that Honda of Clear Lake may have done faulty recall work and they do not want to own up to it because it would be a monetary loss for them. I had just wanted Honda of Clear Lake to look into the problem as they are responsible for it as they did the past recall work on it, but the service clerk did not want to touch this without a diagnostic fee knowing it could be there fault for sure. Honda of Clear Lake why don't you honor your work and have a look at the issue to see what happened before grabbing at my wallet especially with a problem involving safety and the work was done by their mechanics. Poor poor customer service. No resolution. Had to hang up and call Honda corporate. Hopefully I will get a resolution from corporate. They got a 1 star from me because I could not give them a 0 or negative star rating.

39,"December 01, 2016","Thank you so much to Steve & Joshua. I had the best car-buying experience thanks to your talented teamwork. I  have never had such an easy, painless, and honest car-buying or test driving experience. Even after viewing the Honda Pilot Touring model at several Houston dealerships, and test-driving the vehicle at least twice before, Joshua was the first to provide such a thorough demonstration of its capabilities -- making me much more comfortable in my decision to purchase this SUV. Even though I was reluctant to trade in my much-loved Buick, I left feeling more than satisfied with my purchase and above all, like a member of their Honda family. Thanks also to TJ in the Finance Department for working to get me the best interest rate possible, and to the GM for coming out and thanking me for my time and purchase.  I have already told friends and family that they should strongly consider Honda Clear Lake for their future vehicle needs!",5.0
40,"November 07, 2016","My time means a lot to me, so the past few cars that I've purchased has been done via the dealership's internet team, as it tends to cut down negotiating time, drastically.  Joshua and Steve were thorough, professional, and honest.  Joshua took ample time after the sale to go over many of the car's features - his knowledge of Honda products is vast (especially for his tenure - which is closing in on a year).  I have purchase many cars (since I was 16) and in those three decades this is hands down the best experience I've had purchasing a car.  I also want to note that I've tried to purchase twice before with this dealership (in 2000 and 2009) and ended up walking out in disgust.  I couldn't believe the improvement - third time was a charm.  Anyway, if you've had problems in the past - you may want to reconsider and give this team a try, because it's evident to me how vast an improvement this dealership with superior training to its sales team.

42,"September 02, 2016","I recently purchased a demo vehicle last weekend and all four rims where severely damaged. My sales man Talha Ashraf goes by TA promised me a new set of rims and tires if I purchased the vehicle that day. He also gave me two different story's about how the rims were damaged. I purchased the vehicle and they had me bring the car back 3 days later to get the new wheels and tires. It took them 2 days to return my car and it still had the same tires and all they did was a poor job of buffing  out the scratches on the rims. When I pointed it out he said he never promised me a new set of tires and rims. He immediately brought up the paper I signed at the time of sale that stated ""Fix"" wheels.  I left there very upset!! I can't believe he is allowed to  promise someone one thing then not follow through. I am now driving a vehicle with poorly buffed rims and the same scratched up tires that were originally on it. This is not what I was promised  at the time of sale and the paperwork was written in a way that would allow him to get away with such an act.

Thank you so much for answering all of my questions honestly, and making my trip not as painful as it otherwise could have been. I'm happy with the car I purchased. That's a pretty ideal situation when it comes to buying a new car, and it's all thanks to you.

53,"March 05, 2016","I visited Honda of Clear Lake couple of days back looking for Pre-owned 2013-14 Honda Accord EX-L V6 on 3/2/2016 evening. Ali Mian was sales person who showed us the cars. He was really nice and showed us cars really well showing all features. We test drive one of the car 2013 EX-L V6 Honda Accord Red Color. We were interested in the car, but we wanted to check out few other colors and also check out 2014 colors. So, we didnt finalized the deal during first trip as lot of people don't do. There was no pressure from Ali, though his manager tried to push us to think about it. Though till now it was all normal things which we see at any dealership. On next day which was thursday I got a call from Ali asking me if I had any questions and told me that they will work out a good deal for me if I am interested in car. Again, this was all normal things with a dealership. I wanted to check out another 2013 and 2014 EX-L V6 they had listed online on their website to look at and finalize what I want to buy. So, I called up Ali and he told me that they can work out a really good deal for me for 2013 EXL V6 which I test drive and I should come in as they can do it in person. So, I drove 1.5 hrs to drive to Clear Lake from west houston. 

But, when I reached there and asked for Ali, I was told that he is delivering a vehicle and should come soon and was asked to wait. I was told after few minutes that someone else can help me, which I was not keen on as I had talked before with someone who knew what I was looking for, but still I gave him stock numbers of cars which I was interested to look at before I can make decision. From here things just went downhill. That young sales guy was trying to get keys, but Ali's manager realized that we are looking at other car and clearly didnt wanted us to see other cars and we were told that those cars have been sent for auction and not available. So, only option we have is to look at that red accord EXL V6. So, we suggested we will like to talk with Ali who was the sales person we dealt with until now. So, we were told to wait. All of sudden they come back and tell us that there is one 2014 EXL V6 available to see. So, sales guy brings that car to show us. But, when he takes us to test drive, the car is really dirty with literally trash on passenger side. It was clearly attempt to stop us from pursuing any other car and have us make deal on car we have seen. When we asked price to person showing us the car, he tells us that his job is just to show us car. Pricing is known to his manager. Does someone showing car at dealership not know price? People see car without price? This was their clear strategy to not show us any other car and making us to decide on car they had shown to us before. They were really disrespectful to show car with trash on passenger side asking me if I want to test drive it with my wife. Really dissappointed with Ali's manager trying to play stupid game which is so obvious from their face...

Honestly I was there to make a deal, just trying to confirm my choice by checking couple of similar cars. But, really sad and insulting sales strategy by Ali's manager insulted us. I will never ever visit this dealership again or make sure anyone I know in my network ever thinks of buying car from here. I will recommend you to not go here. Even though dealerships try to make you buy, but quite obvious their approach to make you buy a vehicle is really insulting..There are many good options to buy Honda's in Houston and I will rather go somewhere else and buy car where they take good care of customer and not treat them like this..I will really like Sales Team to change their approach, if they want to build customers and gain their confidence...IF they think that customer is stupid and they dont understand what is going on, they are wrong..",1.6

In the end we came to an agreement that worked for all of us.

I give him 5 stars as he went above and beyond, and even when there were miscommunications he pressed forward with working options and ways to make things happen. I take off a star for the middle-man tactic that the dealership itself used once we started the $ negotiations. That woman was rude, used factually incorrect information, and basically told us that ""you can't trust TrueCar.com or any other website that gives sales pricing information"". We walked out after our experience with her, and when we came back and got to the same point on a different day, they other middle-man just didn't care and said ""sorry we can't do the deal"" so we walked out again. I had exact quotes from 8 different dealers with their best prices, and he rejected them saying ""you can't trust these"". Anyways, once Touny found out things fell apart, he worked with his managers and calculated a price that worked for everyone and we are very happy with our purchase now.

136,"May 25, 2014","        I was sold a used vehicle by salesman John Aldridge whom said that it had no problems, yet as I drove the vehicle home that day the engine service light appeared on the Dashboard. When contacting Aldridge, he told me to call the guy responsible for maintenance of the vehicle Johnny Longoria. I go see him and he said the light was not on when I drove it off the lot suggesting that I did something to the vehicle on the way home from the dealership. He said he checked the car out himself before it was sent to sales. Another person that bought a vehicle from the dealership had the same thing happen to him his engine light appeared on when he bought the vehicle home. I told Johnny that he is a liar because the person who recommended me who bought his new vehicle had the same problem. Johnny Longoria said that he will keep the vehicle and after a week he finally come to me and tell me that the vehicle have some problems and will cost 2700.00 and they will only help to pay 700 dollars of it. So he lied about checking the vehicle the first time-it was never checked. One of the workers bought the vehicle to me and said they manually cut off the Engine Light. HE ADMITTED THAT HONDA IS CUTTING OFF THE SERVICE ENGINE LIGHTS TO MAKE A SALE AND ONCE YOU DRIVE OFF THE LOT YOU ARE STUCK WITH A VEHICLE WITH MULTIPLES OF PROBLEMS. 
        The next person not to trust nor do business with is finance manager Geovanni Suarez. When filling out the paper work, he issued the wrong paper work and information of the vehicle as if he put wrong information on contract. When I saw the paperwork, I gave it back and said this is not me or my information that I gave to him. When filling-out the correct paperwork, they gave me a two year warranty which Johnny Longoria said was not effective until after 30 days. Geovanni disappeared without giving me my copy of paperwork to the vehicle. When I tried calling him he hung the phone-up in my face. When I went to the dealership he had a bad attitude and said that he had a meeting to go to and he had no time to talk to me. 
         I am writing this review to inform people that are looking for used vehicle or even new vehicle to not to trust these people. When buying a new or used car have the vehicle thoroughly checked to make sure what you are buying because they will not be honest with you and you maybe buying a piece of crap that may have you with more car problems than you had before you went their. Do not believe a word that come out of their mouth make sure professionalism is at its best. All paper signed and copies made with your witness next to you.

Together, we handled the paperwork, HE COPIED MY DRIVER'S LICENSE, finished it all, and signed it, drove away hoping to live happily ever...well 2-3 years. However, about a week or more later (on a Tuesday) a manager of something (completely illiterate, btw) called and informed me that my DL was expired and I'm not legally allowed to finance a vehicle.  

I was a little surprised because I had never had to renew my license before and was unaware it had expired. I apologized ALOT and said I will have it taken care of by the end of the week. My company was hosting a CEU course Monday the following week and, us education nurses were SUPER busy. He said by Friday will be fine. I took off Thursday afternoon to renew it. Thursday morning I go out to my vehicle, and well, it no longer existed. Honda of Clear Lake had it towed back to them a day before they said it was an issue. I received no rhyme or reason.

Now, I had the right to know if there was any major failure with any critical component of the car and hence I repeatedly asked her if the car has any major issue. I was told throughout that most of the things have been looked into and it's a great deal for the price. And hence I bought this car as nothing looked problematic and I trusted her words and thought that they must be fair since they are authentic honda dealers. But a week after I bought the car, it stopped running and upon checkup the mechanic told me that the catalytic converter was damaged and the whole exhaust was badly choked! I never knew they would resort to bad practices to sell the car anyhow. All she kept telling me later wen I called her up later with this problem was she never knew about the problem herself as she was not authorized to see the service record. Common, are you kidding me? You are selling the car and you don't even know that the car has a major problem?!! Never deal with this sales representative I had dealt with as she would just not try to dupe you but also would behave rudely despite u talking politely to her (I talked to her politely even though I was mad with deception she had thrown at me, but she was very rude with me despite her mistake).

My parents were also going to purchase a new pilot from them but the manager wouldn't beat a price from another dealership. They let them walk over a measly $200. The other dealership gladly lowered the price by $200 and my parents bought there. If I had it to do over again I would have purchased from another dealership. They also scratched my brand new car while they were detailing it. I was still in the finance office when it happened. They promised to knock off another $300 and repair it. They gave me a loaner and a few days later I came back in to get my new car. They were still tinkering around with the $300 and Dr Will was actually going to give me a personal check for it.

146,"June 03, 2013","First off, let me state that Dr. Will is the ONLY thing I can give a #5 rating.  He is a kind, caring, and compassionate person.
I have purchased from Clear Lake Honda in the past with no problems.  This time it was different.  I have never been treated so
shabbily in my life.  I am currently retired and recently widowed.  I feel that I was being discriminated against because of my age
and being retired.  I asked the financial person why all the change in attitude toward me and his reply was ""Because you were
working then"". I couldn't believe my ears.  They also wanted proof of where I get my income, (that I feel is a very private matter)
and proof of residence.  I've had the same home for the past 45 years and it does not have a mortgage. Yes, now listen to this,
they also said I would need a co-signer.  Excuse me, at 68 yrs of age I need a co-signer.  BULL.
Needless to say, I walked out and NOT in a good mood.  
Wanting a new CR-V for my last major purchase in this life I looked on the internet for another Honda dealership.  Low and behold,
Big Star Honda popped up and in a convenient location for me to drive to.  I can't believe that two dealerships can be so different
as night and day.  Can you believe, I was treated like a customer.  James Zurga was my salesperson and MJ worked with the
finances.  I was treated with respect and understanding.  I couldn't have asked for any better than these two guys.  I was in and
out in less than 2 hrs. and I got a GREAT deal.  THANK YOU BIG STAR HONDA

BE WARNED ‚Äì customer service is over the moment you drive your car off the lot.  I purchased the lifetime oil package in July  and called in November to schedule service for a recall item, a tire rotation, and oil change.  I live over an hour from the dealership and wanted to schedule everything on a day when all items could be done at once AND was convenient for me since I would be out my car for the recall service.  I spoke to Glen, the ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù manager.  He asked how many miles where on my car and I replied about 8300.  He said I could not get an oil change until ~10,000 miles.  I said I would be close to that by the time of the appointment and that day was convenient for me, and he said they would charge me anyway.  He then tried to pawn off the recall item on another dealership.  When I told him if I would never speak to anyone at my job the way he was speaking to me (in such a rude and condescending manner), he asked what I did for a living.  When I told him I am a children‚Äôs librarian, he told me, ‚ÄúThen I should know better than anyone to read my contract.‚Äù  I called Honda of America and filed a formal complaint, but I am sure nothing will be done.  AVOID THIS DEALERSHIP and buy from any other Houston/Galveston area Honda Dealership.  As for me, I will pay for oil changes elsewhere and go to the Honda Dealer in Galveston, where I should have purchased my car.  ",1.0

162,"October 18, 2012","1. Honda of Clear Lake would Not honor their own coupon for a new car deal. Harvey Bishop deliberately gathered a crowd could so he could yell at me in front of his staff. I ended up buying at McDavid Honda (a brand new CRV-EXL with Navi).

2. I was having the oil changed on my wife's CRV. I watched from outside the bay. The other mechanics were using very foul language. My mechanic saw me and stopped the others from swearing. I thought it worthy of a compliment. I relayed the story to my service adviser. The service adviser wanted me to share my experience with the Service Manager. I went to share my compliment with the Service Manager and he verbally jumped all over me.

He recalled when I complained to one of his service advisers. The service adviser sold my wife about $400 worth of unnecessary work (according to Honda's Service / Owner's manual). All that was requested was an oil change; the car had less that 20K miles and was less than 2 years old.  When I proved, using Honda's own manual, that the work was uncalled for, the charges were removed. However, the Service Manager has held a grudge AND they even have DOCUMENTED IT. How petty!

My experiences have ALL been NEGATIVE! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THEM FOR ANYTHING. The ONLY reason I go there is because I purchased a Lifetime Oil change from them.

There is an overall disinterest in helping customers. Having people wait around for no reason seems to be the slogan. I purchased my vehicle from this dealership and was pleased with the overall purchase. I spent  two hours for the service department to tell me the check engine light was due to a gas cap leak.    They told that they would need to keep my 2 week old car for a day to leak test the system.  Because they did not have a loaner available I scheduled a time to come back when they would have one available.  When i arrived they had me wait another 2 hours to rediagnose the gas cap error.  I then was stuck into a civic which was dirty smelly and loud.  I dropped the car off Tuesday morning and it was not ready until late Friday.  When i arrived it took 20 minutes of waiting while no less than 5 employees milled about talking to each other for to finally go looking for Jason.  I find him standing around with 3 garage guys shooting the breeze and he pointedly avoids me.  I complain to Troy who says all the right words but could not care less.  This will the last company car i purchase from these guys.  I guess they dislike cash purchases.

182,"June 07, 2012","I purchased a car from them in 2008 and feel like I was ripped off by this dealership.
They added $2k to the sticker price of the car and made me sign a piece of paper from the manager, saying the car was a hot item and they are applying a surcharge. Well I am an idiot and signed it. Needless to say the car didn't get the mileage it was suppose to, according to them ""I wasn't driving the car right"", which I was not told there was a proper way to drive the vehicle upon purchasing and if I knew that I wouldn't have wanted the car. I've had regular oil changes there over the years and their work is ok at best, one instance they didn't put the under carriage back on properly and it fell down and pulled down some of my bumper with it while driving down the freeway. When I took it in for repair they charged me to fix the bumber and did a bad job as one of the clips were still broken, and I often had to ""punch"" the side of the bumper back in.

So here I am 4 years later, and I traded the car in at a GREAT dealership this time. When I called Honda of Clear Lake for a refund of insurance that I had purchased the finance manager asked ""why didn't you come back here to get a car?"", I responded that I felt like they screwed me over on my last car and left me severely upside down.

First I emailed all the specifics and did not hear anything from the sales person.  A day went by and I thought well I will call, sales persons phone was turned off and left a message in the morning around 9 am.  It was around 1:30 and I had not heard anything and so I called again and explained to the sales person we were ready to buy the car they had showed us.

?

We did not purchase our 2005 Civic at this dealership. We required service that, although ‚Äúroutine‚Äù in nature, had a scope that extended beyond an ‚Äúexpress‚Äù type service.

Prior to scheduling our service, we did read and think about all of this dealership Service Reviews that are shown in the Google site (and elsewhere) for same ~ as is plainly evident, the nature of the Google reviews is both mixed and extreme ~ it seemed to us that these reviews were returned either as ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù or returned as ‚Äúvery poor‚Äù. I suppose that it may be simply a part of prudent human nature that the ‚Äúvery poor‚Äù reviews weighed more heavily with us, initially, than the ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù reviews ~ in any case, we found this discrepancy to be confusing and concerning. As such, we then elected to speak with some co-workers who drive Hondas and have previously taken their vehicles to Honda of Clear Lake for service. 

? I have only been at my present employer for a matter of months and have not yet established a solid comfort level with most of my colleagues. The people that I had approached in this venue returned comments to me ranging from ‚ÄúI hate that place‚Äù (sic) to along-the-lines-of ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll have no problem there‚Äù (sic). Again, a returned set of both mixed and extreme reviews.

? Due to our ‚Äúnew-comer‚Äù status and unfamiliarity with the Houston metro area, and considering our present ‚ÄúHoliday rush-rush‚Äù schedule, we elected to go-through with what we felt was a ‚Äúcoin toss‚Äù and scheduled our service using the Honda of Clear Lake on-line scheduling service.

? Our advice to the reader is to exercise caution when using this on-line feature ~ we had received several automated e-mail messages confirming our service appointment, which is a nice feature. However, (and reverting to ‚Äúprudent‚Äù nature) I ‚Äúchecked‚Äù our on-line service status the day prior to our scheduled service and, some-way, some-how, our service was shown to be ‚Äúcancelled‚Äù. Woops!‚Ä¶all-of-a-sudden, our thoughts of scheduling our service at Honda of Clear Lake began racing back to the ""negative reviews"" that we earlier had read and had been told of‚Ä¶closing our eyes to what we perceived as ‚Äúimpending disaster‚Äù, we contacted Honda of Clear Lake by telephone about our service scheduling, and then had our call immediately referred to Mr. Troy Tuscana, Service Advisor.

? We explained our situation to Mr. Troy, and, without any ‚Äúdrama‚Äù and without any excuse making or using some slick-mannered spin on our situation, Mr. Troy, without any hesitation, honored our initial service appointment request and in the most-professional manner. Any customer cannot request or expect any better service in this regard ~ so, Mr. Troy was responsible for restoring our confidence and we subsequently elected to continue to move-forward.

? Our presentation at Honda of Clear Lake Service Department, our meeting with Mr. Troy Tuscana, our service, and the timely return of our vehicle was a flawless experience.

? The Cashier was friendly, professional and cute-as-a-button ~ I did not ask for her name (because my hovering wife carries a big stick with her‚Ä¶another story altogether‚Ä¶), and would have liked to provide her with some ‚Äúcredit‚Äù here, so I‚Äôve obviously failed this Cashier and in that regard.

? During our service waiting period, we had made ‚Äúeye-contact‚Äù with various and sundry Honda of Clear Lake staff, and we were always greeted in a pleasant and hospitable manner. Free-of-charge coffee and hot chocolate were nice, and the washrooms were found to be kept spic-and-span and odor-free.

? The reader will understand, then, that our review will return to Honda of Clear Lake Service Department an ‚ÄúExcellent‚Äù rating that is based upon our single experience there ~ we are now numbered as one of their customers returning a ‚Äúpositive‚Äù review. On the one hand, we absolutely do not intend to either implicitly or explicitly discredit any of the other preceding reviewers before us that have reported less-than-positive aspects about their service experience. On the other hand, the reader should know that we consider ourselves to be amongst the ‚Äúaverage‚Äù customer population, with ‚Äúaverage‚Äù service needs, and, save for the on-line Service scheduling ‚Äúhiccup‚Äù, our experience was nothing short of perfect. We will be returning to Honda of Clear Lake for our future service.

234,"August 31, 2011","Was working back and forth with internet manager Will Hensel for a few weeks on a V6 Accord coupe and had settled on the only white one on their lot for which he quoted me by email a full out the door price. Made an appointment to see him but when I arrived, he was not available for one reason or another. I was then given Viresh Patel who was very helpful and courteous in test driving the vehicle with me. After test driving and going back in to finalize deal, ended up being told that price quoted was not correct since he (Will) did not factor in the dealer installed items. This infuriated me since I had printed even Will's email with full out the door price and thought that we were already past this and instead was faced with a price thousands more than expected. I left the dealership without negotiating one cent and with a very negative impression of Will Hensel in particular as he did not seem interested in honoring his own written price quote (dunno which is possibly worse, him not knowing full details about an item he is selling or him being deceptive in quoting one price just to get you in the door). I ended up buying a V6 Accord coupe instead from Gillman Honda at Fortbend whose folks know how to be upfront on pricing and how to treat customers. I will never come back to Honda Clear Lake and will make sure friends, colleagues and family know to stay clear of this dealer as well. Salesman Viresh was the only positive person I came in contact with and he in fact also called me a few days later to offer me the same unit at a lower price (but this was still above what was quoted to me by Will Hensel) to which I declined having already contacted Gillman Honda instead with an offer to buy there instead. ",2.0
235,"August 01, 2011","I have not been able to buy any of my last four Honda vehicles from this dealer.  They are always too high on price.  The last time I tried to buy from them I was played in the usual salesman pitch.  I had been by to look at cars several days earlier.  The salesman called me back and said that if we would come down that evening and buy the car that he would ""make it worth my time.""  He did not.  He jerked us around and would not negotiate from invoice, kept saying ""what do you want your payment to be""  Would not meet any reasonable offer with a counter offer.  We bought the car for invoice a few days later at Honda of lake jackson. 

The previous times we had tried to purchase a car at Honda of Clearlake we had left and bought at David McDavid, Ron Carter(used), and Honda of Kingwood.  I would recommend any of these dealerships.  

I constantly get service from Honda of Clearlake, and buy parts from them.  These sides of the business is excellent.  If only the Retail part of the dealership would take a hint from their service department and not play games and refuse to make a reasonable deal.

Dealing with Honda of Clearlake is a joke, and should only be used for entertainment purposes.

Later, DB.",2.8
236,"July 09, 2011","I didn't end up purchasing a vehicle from this dealer but had such a good experience with Will Hensel in sales that I wanted to post about him.  When I was researching info. and getting price quotes on the new car I wanted, he helped me not only more than any other dealer, but more than anyone I have ever done business with when shopping for a new car.  The difference is that you can tell he actually enjoys helping people and is not just concerned with making a profit for himself.  It would be a different world if more were like that!!!  Highest recommendation indeed.    ",4.8

238,"June 30, 2011","Our sales consultant was Shawn Day and he was most helpful.  There was a musty smell in the truck and Shawn made arrangements to have someone come to the dealership to take care of it.  The man was there when I arrived and the problem was taken care of promptly. (Though the fix smelled almost as bad as the original odor.  But in time got better.) So I give Shawn a 5. The reason for the 4 for quality of work is because perhaps the product to remove the smell could be a bit less strong.

What I didn't enjoy was sitting through the spiel about the warranty.  I had no intention of purchasing it and the poor guy had to go through the whole thing knowing that.  It was a waste of both of our time. Reason for the 4 for overall experience.

I had compared prices a bit and thought the price might have been a couple hundred more than it needed to be.  And the on-line price was less. Thus the rating of 4. But the truck fit what I needed perfectly so I am happy with the purchase. 

I certainly would return to this dealership for a car or truck purchase in the future.",4.4
239,"June 30, 2011","I gave them a great rating because I had a wonderful experience. I told them I had a limited budget and they were still very nice and worked with me to find something I would love and could afford.

245,"June 28, 2011","We actually revisited this dealership on a whim after visiting another Honda dealership in the area. After being treated poorly at the previous dealership, I was not in the mood to look at more cars. We were looking for a used certified Honda Accord. We didn't consider new because based on the other dealership, we thought it was out of our price range. As we were leaving we met Gustavo Osuna. He heard our complaints and concerns offered a new car. Gustavo was a limitless source of information about everything. We test drove a 2011 Accord and Gustavo knew the answer to every question I asked and it was a lot of questions. He was friendly, approachable and most importantly--not pushy. We didn't even plan on buying that day. After learning more about the special finance offer Honda had, we decided to go forward with purchasing the vehicle at the agreed price. I've heard that this dealership does not haggle--but they really didn't have to. They came down a bit on price, but compared to what the other guys were charging, it was a fair price. 

We found out that Gustavo had only been working there for two months and we were shocked. We made it a point to tell his manager and share our experience at David McDavid hours earlier. The difference was night and day. I didn't get Gustavo's manager, but he was friendly and approachable as well. He didn't try to hijack the sale like I have seen other managers do. 

When we met with Raheel in finance, it was after 9 pm. He showed no signs of being tired or frustrated. He didn't rush us at all. He answered all of our questions and was patient as we considered our options. That said, he was very efficient and knowledgeable.

After our experience, I would definitely recommend this dealership. I am very happy with our purchase and our experience. ",5.0

I'm writing to give a big thank you to my salesperson Jeremy DelaRosa. Let me begin by saying that I've purchased several cars in my life and it's not my favorite thing to do. On June 1, 2011 I visited Honda of Clearlake and purchased a 2008 Jetta. Jeremy was extremely professional, but most of all he listened carefully to what I said and he EXECUTED FLAWLESSLY! Jeremy made my car purchase an extremely pleasant one and I truly appreciate his efforts. Jeremy did what I know sales is all about, which is building relationships with his customers. Thank you Jeremy, you represent Honda of Clearlake well.

The next day we came closed up the deal and he gave it to us for a great price and explained all the features to the family in detail and mentioned we could call him anytime if we had any questions or concerns.

We were sure that we would not be able to buy a new Pilot, but Geovanni and Honda of Clear Lake gave us such a great deal that it just did not make sense to buy a used one.  I worked with Geovanni over the phone and only met him on the day when my car was ready for pick up.  He was very clear throughout the whole process - negotiating the deal, ordering the vehicle, informing us of when the car would arrive to the dealership, adding the roof rack accessory, letting us know when the car would be ready for pickup.  We always knew what was going on.  He was a pleasure to meet and the deal just could not be beat.  Geovanni turned an unfortunate experience into one with a positive final outcome.  We would recommend him without reservation.  THANKS GEOVANNI!!!",5.0

I ended up speaking with a salesman who names I do not recall and he verified that the vehicle was still there and also verified the listed price. I drove about 30 minutes to the location and spoke with a salesman named Big Al and told him that I wanted to purchase the vehicle. I test drove the vehicle and when I came back I was told by by Big Al that there was a typo and that the vehicle is $11,995. I was furious because I had a feeling something like this would happen. I went to speak to the internet sales manager Tuan Van Le who was very rude. He showed me the Clear Lake of Honda dealership web site that stated best price over $8,994 would be considered. Tuan Van Le had went to the page and added the wording. I still had the Auto Trader site page open on my phone from the night before. The Auto Trader clearly stated the price was $8,994. Tuan Van Le kept telling me why was I switching things around. As i kept questing him he had nothing to say and asked me to leave several times.

I am in the military and so is my son for whom I purchased this car. They gave me there best price of $20,000.00 and told them I needed to keep looking. I am a USAA member and found that they have a dealership program for its members even if you don‚Äôt finance through them. Gillman Honda was going to sell me the same car for $18,500.00, but they are 25 miles away from my house. I took this price, with the verified e-mail, back to Honda of Clear Lake and told them if they would match this price I would purchase the car the next day, Will and Ruben talked it over with the person that approves the deals and said it could be done so I told Ruben to expect me in the morning. Fully expecting to drive away with my new car, I had my neighbor drop me off before he went to work. I have had some bad experiences buying a car before but this was by far the worst. From the moment I stepped foot in the dealership that day it was bad. Nobody knew I was coming in, nobody I had dealt with was around and It took them 30 minutes to get me help and the deal we came up with was out the window because they said no one had written it down, so I walked away.

He was a very friendly guy when I sat down and we chatted a bit before we got down to business but after he tried to sell me an extended warranty and I turned it down his demeanor changed, gone was the helpful attitude and friendly smile. Before I knew it a flurry of paperwork started flying about on his desk ready for my signature, it felt like he just wanted to get it over with. Turns out they did a bait and switch on me and overcharged me $2000.00 on the price of the vehicle which I did not find out until later after it was too late and the vehicle was mine.

340,"March 07, 2010"," The absolute WORST car buying experience ever! Everyone I dealt with such as the salesman, sales managers, finance director, general manager, and owner were either incompetent, rude, dishonest, or unethical.

-According to the dealership's website, there was a black Civic and a metallic Civic in stock. We asked for the metallic, but the salesman claimed it was sold. However, up to one month later, the internet sales manager was insisting that the metallic one was still on the lot!

-The salesman didn't even bother to call and tell us that the metallic one was sold. He surprised us with this news when we got to the dealership, and he even said that he's been getting the black one ready for us to take home.

-The car was not cleaned or prepared at all. All of the smudges in the car during the test drive were still there, and the low pressure light was still on.

-From the very beginning, I told the salesman that I would do no financing. I told him that I needed a car with a $23,000 drive out price because I had $20,000 cash and $3,000 govt. voucher. The black Civic was on sale on the website for $24,900 drive out, and the salesman kept offering it to us for $24,000. Finally a week later he agreed to $23,000. He wrote on the offer sheet ""$23,000 drive out"", I signed it, did the rest of the paperwork with the finance person, and I gave the finance guy $20,000 in cashier's checks and the $3,000 voucher. He thanked me, and took the car.

Three weeks later, the dealership calls and says that there's a discrepancy in the papers. I met with the finance director at the dealership. Basically, they screwed up the paperwork. Instead of making the numbers come out to $23,000 drive out, it came out to $26,000 drive out. It was obviously a mistake because the offer sheet clearly said $23,000 drive out, but he didn't care.

-I offered to settle the deal for $1,000.  The finance director said yes, and that the general manager approved it.  However, when I went to the dealership, they said no!

-I called the general manager personally, and he was incredibly rude.  He was not apologetic at all.  In the end, he did agree to the $1,000 because he was ""tired of dealing with this"". 

-I also called the owner, but he never responded.  I guess they really don't care about their customers.

We had received calls from the dealership about trading in my wife's 2007 Ridgeline with 33,000 miles, that we bought at Honda of Clear Lake, so we decided to pay a visit and see what we could get done. I took my 2005 Accord(bought used elsewhere) with 80,000 miles on it and my wife drove her Ridgeline to the dealership. We first met with Calvin and he introduced us to Chris. I'm glad Chris was a patient man! Between my accounting questions and my wife being an expert ""question asker"", we had him tied up for some time. After the normal dealing on the trade-ins and new car price, we arrived at a deal that made us very happy. My wife got her a new Ridgeline and I purchased a Civic Hybrid. My wife's note is lower and the small increase in my note will be more than paid for by the gas savings on the Hybrid. I've been buying autos for more than 30 years and this had to be one of the more pleasant dealings I have had. They shot straight with me and didn't play games. My wife has also taken advantage of their oil change for life plan and it was worked great. She takes it in and they go over the entire vehicle to make sure everything is in good working order. I will now be a part of that same plan. Let me also say that Ruben Flores in the Finance department took good care of us. He explained everything and was able to get us a good interest rate comparable to what we had found through our credit union. I give the dealership a thumbs up and look forward to future dealings.

He checked the ATF level and found it to be 1&1/2 quarts low.  He put the truck back up in the air and began checking connections related to the transmission oil. He found a loose clamp on an ATF-fluid transfer line and tightened it back up.  I had had the transmission serviced at a Subaru dealer six week prior and apparently they didn't tightened up the hose clamp sufficiently when they were finishing the service. 

If the tech hadn't of been going the extra mile and checking for other problems while doing the oil change then I could have lost my transmission.

How to make $1125 an hour (legally but not ethically)

I took my 2005 Accord to Honda of Clear Lake after the check engine light came on. I usually do not take my vehicles to the dealership for non-warranty work, but because most check engine lights are caused by a malfunction in the emission control system I thought the repair might be covered under Honda's emission control extended warranty (Honda warranties MOST emission control components for 70,000 miles). The service rep told me it would cost $96 for them to diagnose the problem and tell me what was needed. Fifteen minutes after I handed the guy my keys he came and told me that an oxygen sensor had failed, and the repair was not covered by warranty. Before I tell you how much he quoted to do the repair, let me tell you what happened after I turned him down. 

I purchased the oxygen sensor from the parts counter at the Honda dealership for $68. For those of you who are unfamiliar with cars, the oxygen sensor screws into the exhaust system and looks sort of like a spark plug with a long wire coming out the top end. The wire has a male connector that plugs into a female receptacle on the car. To replace the sensor I had to disconnect the battery, jack up the car, disconnect the sensor plug, unscrew the old sensor, screw in the new sensor, reconnect the plug, lower the car, and reconnect the battery. This took exactly 12 minutes.

Honda of Clear Lake quoted me $293 to do this repair. This would not have included the $96 fee for the 15 minutes of diagnostic work I had already approved. So I ended up saving $225 for a 12 minute repair. This comes out to $1125 an hour! Not a bad wage for a Wall Street lawyer, much less a Honda mechanic. When I confronted the service rep about this he said they go by a book that tells them how many hours they should charge for a particular repair. According to the book, this was a two hour job.

Moral of the story ‚Äì NEVER EVER go to this dealership for non-warranty work, unless you like paying 3-5 times what a job is worth because of their grossly over-inflated labor charges. It is a little known fact that new car dealerships make 80-90 percent of their profit from repairs, and with business practices like I‚Äôve described above, it‚Äôs easy to see why. 

I wish I could give Honda of Clear Lake ZERO stars.

My first intention was to put in a request into Ellington Field
to have your company put off-limits for service members in the Houston
and surrounding areas. But, I have decided to give your employee an
opportunity to apologize for his lack of professionalism first. I should
get no less than a formal apology from your employee. This is the worst,
I have ever been disrespected in my life. I do not know what kind of
customers Mr. Frank Kelske has dealt with in the past. But, I am not any
customer that is going to tolerate such immaturity issues and such foul
language toward customers when a sale goes wrong. If, he can do it to
me. He is capable of doing this to any customer that comes into your
business. He is lucky, I am a Christian man and that I am turning the
other cheek. I have served this country proudly in the United States
Army for 21 years protecting our people and this great nation. I have to
much going for myself and will not lower my standards to such a person. 


Your employee Frank Kelske on a phone conversation.
Mr. Kelske called me a faggot and told me that my brother-in-law bitched
up on his sale. He did entirely to much work in helping us. And, we do
not need to come back to his dealership. His aggrevation came from me
requesting my $100 back on the initial insurance payment. Which we did
not receive a receipt showing the deposit. Only a paper stating the car
was insured to go off your lot.

I was at your used car department on the 30th helping my
brother-in-law on purchasing a used vehicle.
Supposedly,we had a pre-approval and did not need a co-signature
prior to coming there. We picked out a car and Mr. Kelske did not
even let us drive the vehicle. Orignially, Mr. Kelske stated; he was at
a 18% interest by himself. He would get a lower interest rate if he
added his mother onto the loan. This information was incorrect. Once in
the finance office, the interest rate was showing 22%. Your finance
officer realized their was going to be a problem. Your finance officer
noticed that we were being mislead prior to coming into his office.
When, I asked them to step out for a minute. So, I can discuss the
situation and the sale with my brother in law. I needed to call his mother and
address the high interest rate and if she wanted to continue with the
loan. My mother-in-law was skeptical and did not want to sign the
papers. Mr. Kelske was persistent on pushing the sale to a close. Not
knowing what the final disposition would be with his mother.
Later that day my mother-in-law called the used car sales manager Dario.
Dario stated; ""no problem bring the car back in to our business."" I
talked with Dario yesterday prior to talking with Mr. Kelske on the
phone. Dario did not see a problem with me getting the $100 back from
Mr. Kelske for the insurance. 

Mr. Kelske was determined on keeping my insurance money. And, I
am assuming the way it looks pocketing the money for his own benefit.
Why else would he be so aggressive on keeping the money that was
supposed to go toward his car insurance. ",1.0

I got a phone call from the sales manager Tuan Le saying they needed to see me in person because the deal was never done. They gave me some excuse about a customer interview but that was a lie too. The deal was never done so I had to return the car. Also, the second salesman (Gerald) said the vehicle had a 100,000 mile warranty on it. That was not true either. It only had a 36,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty. It did have 100,000 miles on the power train. He neglected to accurately break it down. They strung me along until last night March 31st.
