0,"January 29, 2020",I did love my Acura RDX but this dealership was the most unprofessional company I have ever dealt with.  I would recommend going anywhere but there to purchase my next vehicle. ,1.0
1,"March 07, 2019",I had been talking to the salesman and working out the details to buy a truck from them. I filled out the credit application and made an appointment to be there Friday morning to buy the vehicle. Got a call Thursday evening at 7:30 telling me they sold it. ,2.0

3,"March 20, 2018","After the Hurricane Harvey aftermath, with my home and my vehicles, I did not know where to start on how I was going to replace everything.  I did not know where to start or how I was going to replace everything.  The first place we started was replacing 2 vehicles.  Our first and only stop was Classic Acura.  Our salesman, Chuck Hemphill, was very friendly, knowledgeable and very easy to deal with.  We told him what we were looking for, how much we could spend and what our notes needed to be.  He was very direct with us and we were in and out with both vehicles replacements in no time.  Thank you Classic Acura for treating us so well during such a hard time in our lives.  YOU HAE OUR BUSINESS FOR LIFE!!!!!",5.0

5,"October 15, 2016",I was interested on an used car. I contacted them and got the confirmation that they still have it. I scheduled a meeting and they confirmed the time a day before the scheduled date again by email. When I showed up over there with my friends taking a leave from my job they told me they already sold the car  three days ago. I was pissed of. The sales person who suppose to meet me was not even in the office. The thing is they can sell their car any time. But they should let me know. Everyone is busy here. ,1.0

7,"December 02, 2014","I recently purchased a new Acura RDX in November 2014. This is the first car my wife and I have purchased in 12 years. Te experience was smooth for beginning to end. Carrington was my sales person and we made a deal quickly with no haggling and they gave me a fair price for my trade in as well. Glenda helped us finalize the deal and she has been helpful too. I would highly recommend ""Classic Acura"". This was an awesome buying experience with no pressure at all!",5.0
8,"November 25, 2014","This was by far the most professional car buying experience I have ever had. I usually average driving a car for seven year until I buy a new car, because of the typical car buying experience. Because of the amazing experience I had at Classic Acura, I will be buying a car from them again and much sooner than usual. ",5.0
9,"November 19, 2014","Learning about and test driving the RDX/MDX was pleasant and informative.  No pressure to hurry up or purchase.  Visited dealership twice, about 4 months apart before making my decision to buy.  Everyone very knowledgeable and friendly - many other dealers I have visited don't have sales people that know their product.  Haven't used service department yet.",5.0
10,"December 03, 2013","First I would like to add that this dealership was $1000 more expensive than the Houston dealerships, and the manager said if you don't like it than you make a decision. Randy said that they were having a good month, so the must not need to sell a car. 

My 2013 experience starts In January.  I met the lady in charge of service and she was very short and not polite. Very busy and did not really care about taking care of my damaged vehicle. The only response I reviewed from her is that our staff gets paid 80 an hour to put your car up.  

Trying to buy dealer parts was difficult because the guy doesn't return calls and is not there often. I needed a few things and getting ahold of that guy was difficult. I called the receptionist and left a message for her. I left a message on his answering machine. I went down there and he wasn't there. I had to keep going back until I finally got him while he was in. This took about a week. This was not vet convenient seeing as I  a working professional In the area. This was all in May-ish.

Went to check out a vehicle. Tried to learn about it and test drive it. Fred treated me like I was a waste of time and that I was not worthy of touching an Acura. He have me funny looks when I wanted to touch the buttons and familiarize my self with the differences between the 2013 and 2014 MDX redesign first hand. Fred also become irritated when I did not tell him my life story. I am shopping lots of dealerships and should not have to divulge personal information to get good service. Like whereabouts in Beaumont do I live, where was I from, where do I work, what do I do.... I should not have to prove my worth before getting in an Acura. Fred made me feel like I needed to buy it first and then learn about it. He passed me along to Nick and said he had other things to do.Nick came of as a very cocky and conceded salesman. He kept his sunglasses on most of the time with his head cocked back and very laid back. He just sat there with the attitude like, ""it's an Acura, you ready to buy or what."" When preparing to test drive, he was going to drive it! I asked to drive the MDX and RDX so that I can experience the $15-20,000 difference, but he did not want to. Also, when tear driving, I said I drive I very bumpy roads and highway to go to work and wanted to take a nearby route that matches my day to day travels. Nick said that we have to get back soon and that I can only go on a predetermined route. This all happened in September-ish

I have been to EVERY major dealer in Beaumont and this is the most conceded one of them all. I have experienced excellent customer service in Beaumont. Unfortunately not at this place. ",1.0
