0,"June 21, 2013","Came in due to excessive smoke from the car. Later learned from a friend that there was a recall. I never got the notice. Was not able to get the car back until the next day. It's running well now.

Ray was very courteous and helpful. Kept me informed of my repair progress
 and the problems with my car.

1,"June 30, 2012","Beware of this dealership. I went in to this dealership telling them I was going to have my father be the cosigner and I would be the primary on the loan. After giving them credit info salesman Juan called me and said everything was good to go and I could take the car home. Understand, I have yet to have signed or initialed anything. I continued to tell the salesman I will not take the car until I know what my interest rate is, what my payments are and how much is being financed. After threatening to shop somewhere else they gave me the info I wanted. After work I went in to sign the paperwork. I had to wait an hour in the lobby before I could meet Mary in finance. Well the first thing I was told was that my father was the primary and I was the consigner on the loan. I explained that I twice requested that I be the primary. At this time ""Mrs"" finance gave me attitude and said that was the only way to get the low interest rate and that it didn't matter who was listed as the primary. Well, I finally had enough bull and told them that all they had done was waste two days of my time and I would shop somewhere else. My advice is stay away from this dealership. They are flat out liars. I bought a car somewhere else. ",2.2
