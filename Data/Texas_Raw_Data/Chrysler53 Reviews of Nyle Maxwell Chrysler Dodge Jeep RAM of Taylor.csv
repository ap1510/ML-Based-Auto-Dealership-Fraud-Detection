0,"June 19, 2020","I dropped my car off at the service department on June 2, 2020. I knew the left rear axle boot was torn. I received no contact from my service advisor, so on 4 June I called for an update. I was told that the part was ordered and would arrive in a few days, and my car would be done on the 8th or 9th. I still hadn't heard anything by the afternoon of the 9th, so I called again. I was then told the part for my car was on back order and it would be another several days before it would arrive (5 to be exact). I told them my car had sat there long enough, and I wanted it back. Terry (my service advisor) agreed, and told me he would call once the part came in. When I picked up my car, it was covered in dirt and bird xxxxxxxxx. Being that the dealership is located in the iddle of what use to be a cornfield, I understood that it wouldn't be spotless. Later that evening, I washed my car. This is the 3rd time I have washed it, and I have become very familiar with the blemishes on my car. I always wash it by hand, so I am up close to it as well. Well, i have found several scratches on the hood, passenger door, drivers exterior mirror and left corner of the front bumper. I called to speak to the service manager the morning of the 11th, and was told he wasn't available at them momment, but would call me back shortly. I still haven't heard from him. To further add insult to injury, my parts manager called our Dodge store to inquire about the part for my car to see if there was a way to get it any faster, and not only did they say there were several at their wharehouse, that the part was not and has not been on back order. I feel that my car just sat there for an entire week, and no body bothered to do anything with it.

After 9 days have passed from me picking up my car, I still have not received a phone call from them that my part has arrived that was suppose to be in within 5 days.",1.0

14,"June 21, 2019","Complete blundering idiots! From Steve David the GM to Justin Lynch the sales manger and everyone in between. None of them know what the customer is asking for even when stated in writing! Tried buying a new Challenger and all they needed to answer was a) can it be ordered and built b) price and they couldn't even come up with all the answers. Just ""come on in and we'll get you a new truck"" I wasn't even buying a truck!!
Mean while their crack telemarketing team is calling me with offers! Complete buffoons!!",1.0
15,"June 06, 2019","Dave Amstutz at Nyle Maxwell in Tylor showed the best practices in customer satisfaction and retention. 

He listened to me and understood my need. He explained to me why the vehicle I thought would be best actually is not and sold me a vehicle that was cheaper but fitted my need opposed just selling the more expensive vehicle. 
There was no pressure or forceful closing attempts. 
Quick and painless, the process was made easy.  
He is trustworthy. 
There were no games or hidden meanings. 

I trust that I actually got the best deal under the constraints I set for the purpose of buying a new vehicle. Dave had full support of the entire dealership including the GM Steve David. 

I met Dave because he came highly recommended by a former customer of his. 

Because of my experience I am planning on buying another vehicle for my daughter. 

Best dealership in my 40 years of buying cars. ",5.0
16,"April 18, 2019","Had my new 2019 Dodge Ram truck in the shop 4 times for squealing brakes. 1st and second time they said they could not hear the brakes squeal. The 3rd time I had the manager test drive the truck with me, and he did hear the brakes  squeal , and he said they would fix it. I left it and 3 days later, it was done. 3 weeks after that, the brakes started squealing again! They then said I needed to break them in! Never heard of breaking in the brakes of a new vehicle, but I did! Well, 2 months later, still squealing! After having enough of people commenting on my brakes, and me having to listen to it, I took it back this week on Wednesday. They said my brakes were 100% ok. I asked why the are still squealing!?!? He said that I’m not the only one with the same problem, and that Dodge is aware of the problem, and they have not not came up with a solution to resolve the problem! 
Needless to say and very unhappy, Iv spent 50+ thousands of dollars on a truck with squealing brakes that I was told I have to put up with! I’m not giving up and I want it resolved! ",3.0

I have had my new truck for 3 months, have been in 6 loaners logging more miles in 6 weeks in them then my new truck. But somehow maxwell and Chrysler feel it doesn’t qualify for a buy back. Oh yea, I’m still waiting on parts. I’ve been coming here for 10 years. I’d never believe I would be treated this way. Trust me, stay clear of this dealer and new ram trucks.",1.0

27,"January 06, 2018","I went to purchase a new car.  I had talked to the dealer in Mississippi about the kind of vehicle I might want, and I had a certain amount of cash available for this.  My other car was starting to cause some issues.  I deal with a great many elderly and children, so the one feature I wanted was a full size spare.  My old car would not fit the full sized spare in the original well, so I purchased one anyway, and then I always had a bubble in the trunk.  I did not want that again, so I wanted a vehicle with a full sized spare.  I did not want to get caught between here and El Paso with no tire and only the donought.  

My friend, Bob DeClerk, went with me to look at Nyles Maxwell.  We wandered around, and finally Ken Jones came out to help us.   I explained that the full sized spare would be the one thing that was non negotiable in this vehicle.  NO car without a full sized spare would be purchased.  It was a mantra.  

We looked at several vehicles, and we would always return to that question.  No full spare, move on.  

I wound up in a Dodge Journey, a vehicle I was guaranteed would have a full sized spare.  I took possession of the vehicle on October 26, 2017.  December 31, 2017 found me with a flat tire, a screw had invaded the tire on the rear passenger wheel.  Once the tire was changed, I took the car to Firestone to get it repaired.  I discovered in the changing of the tire that the spare was not full sized but a donought.  What?  

I called Nyles Maxwell on January 2, 2018, and the informed me that they would not give me a spare.  They only promised the car would hold the full sized spare, but they did not promise it would have it.  Did I want to order it.  I had just had a post chemo treatment, and my friend Barbara was here when they called, so she heard that part of the conversation.  (speaker phone)  I did not want to order one from them since I felt they had been a little less than honest about it, so I called Covert Dodge on Wednesday, and they said they had the tire in.  I made an appointment for Thursday morning between jobs, and Bill Schie (spelling?) came to get me about 30 minutes in to my visit, and he told me there was a problem.  He took me back to the shop and showed me that a full sized spare would hit the exhaust pipe and burn a hole in the tire from where the spare fits.  My heart plummeted.  I felt robbed, duped, lied to, etc….  

I am a widow, working hard, living on a fixed income, and I paid cash for this transaction in good faith.  If this is how Nyles Maxwell treats their customers, then they should not be allowed to be in business.  There was never any misunderstanding about what I wanted.

28,"July 27, 2017","I just leased a new 2017 RAM 1500 Lone Star Silver at this Dealership, basically replacing my 2015 RAM 1500 EcoDiesel Lone Star. The sales rep assured me that the new truck would have everything my old truck had PLUS some additional upgrades, mainly due to the ""Silver"" in the model name. My old truck has the Lone Star package with Satellite radio, Navigation, Backup Camera, Parking sensors etc..
As it turns out, the new truck does not have it's Navigation activated - a feature which was a standard component of my EcoDiesel.
Upon requesting that they activate it - to deliver the deal as promised - the sales rep boldly informed me I'd have to pay the $595 activation fee to get it done - and that he really doesn't appreciate unhappy customers contacting him about their gripes. When I asked him to take the vehicle back due to this, his answer was: ""Well, it's a financed deal. I guess you can take it up with the bank"".

My advise: Avoid this dealership at all cost! ""The Original Nyle Maxwell""......",1.0
29,"June 17, 2017","This is the best dealership I've worked with. Brandon Grebe is an extremely patient and knowledgeable salesman. He was able to give tips-and-tricks of the trade and was honest when he didn't have the answer at hand. He never pressured me or made me feel embarrassed for my lack of knowledge, poor negotiation skills, or endless questions. I felt like he was welcoming me to ""his community"" of Jeepers and it was something I wanted to be a part of. Best of all, we communicated primarily via text! He was very flexible with his time and responsive.

I walked away from the deal and he didn't make me feel like I wasted his time. I ended up coming back a week later because I couldn't stop thinking about the car. Daryll (manager) made me feel like I was getting the best deal and, when the Jeep I was negotiating unexpectedly sold, he tried his best to get me into something comparable and better! 

Coy (the finance guy) tried to make the process as painless as possible and was very transparent with the warranties. He even offered to let me call him if I ever had a question later down the line.

The whole team has been welcoming, transparent, and kind. Buy your next car here.",5.0

38,"November 26, 2014","This is the best dealership I have ever dealt with.  If you are in the market for a vehicle call Jimmy Wilcox and you will not be disappointed. I was on a business trip when I inquired about a new Ecodiesel Ram.  Jimmy promptly answered all of my question and sent additional pictures as requested. We were able to work out the price for the new truck plus I received a quote for my trade.  After my trip, Jimmy had the truck waiting for me and everything was exactly has describe.

40,"September 04, 2014",Horrible dealership to do business with.  They will change the numbers on your agreed price.  They will change the sales contract behind your back and flat out lie to your face.  We purchased a 2014 Dodge Journey and after we agreed upon a price they changed the manufacturer rebate and my USAA cash rebate and the price of the vehicle as soon as my fiancé came in to sign the paper work for the vehicle.  Called to talk to them and they tried to tell me I received the rebates and a bunch of other lies.  I guess they assume like most people that I can't figure out a sales contract and figure out where the different charges they added on came from.  Absolutely insulting and the worst experience.  First and last time I will go to this dealership and I wouldn't recommend anyone doing business with this company,1.8
41,"March 22, 2014","I had a very pleasant experience in buying a Ram Pickup from the Taylor dealership.  Jimmy Wilcox was my salesperson and he did an excellent job in meeting my needs in finding the right vehicle for me and Coy did a great job in finding the right financing.  I have always bought a GM product but I'm very happy with my new Ram Pickup, it rides good and gets excellent gas mileage.  I have not had to opportunity to visit your Service Dept. but if it is as good as your Sales Dept., it will be an great experience.  Thanks for making me a very satisfied customer.

43,"January 27, 2014","I came to Nyle Maxwell because of their lifetime powertrain warranty available on all used vehicles. I knew that when I was ready for a new vehicle, this would be the first place I stopped, and I'm very glad I did.
After researching online for pricing and options for a 4-door truck all across the Austin area, I was checking out Nyle Maxwell's stock online. I was contacted quickly by Riley Hebl, who invited me down to look at their stock. I was actually on my way out the door to go down there, good timing. 
I was looking to trade in my Toyota 4Runner, and Riley was helpful in getting the process started while he invited me to look around at the stock of used vehicles, I appreciated that I was free to check out the vehicles without anyone trying to sell me anything right away.
Riley saw that I was looking at trucks, and showed me a 2011 Ram 1500. I was originally in the market for a Chevy, but Riley seemed to get what I was interested in and why, and the truck he showed me was perfect. I was very impressed with the truck when we took a test drive.

What really impressed me about Nyle Maxwell starts here: 

The price of the truck was about $4k cheaper than I'd seen online anywhere else, and the truck had 1/3rd of the miles as the others I had looked at. It was clean, well serviced, and beautiful, the perfect truck for my family. We started talking numbers, and they gave me $3500 on my trade in, even with 200K miles on it! I was expecting maybe $1k!
I was able to take the truck home that night to drive it, and show my wife to get her thoughts about it. She loved it as well, but was a little concerned about the payments and more so about how the we would come up with the down-payment of $700, which we didn't expect at first.
I went to bring the truck back the next day and talk to Riley about not being able to do the deal until I got another paycheck on the first of the month.
I was worried the truck would be sold by the time I was able to pay the down payment comfortably, and told him I did want the truck, but couldn't do it until the first. He replied quickly that he would figure out how to do it without the down payment, and push the first payment back a month. I told him that I would drive it home today if he could pull that off, and he said ""We're going to make that happen."" And they did!
While completing the final paperwork, I was interested in additional warranty coverage, but the monthly payments would be just out of reach with the options I was looking at. Instead of passing by the issue, they were somehow able to get me better warranty coverage than I was looking for, and my payments were lower by $80 a month. Don't know how that happened, but needless to say I am very thankful.
I ended up with a great warranty at a monthly payment lower than the original quote!

At the end of the day, everyone at Nyle Maxwell was helpful, approached problems with a can-do attitude, and was obviously focused on service more than sales. I have to say, it was the best experience I've ever had at a dealership, by far. If you're looking for a vehicle, make sure to stop by the Taylor dealership, they definitely earned a great review and my recommendation! I'll definitely be returning when the time comes.

44,"April 23, 2013","When I first arrived, Jimmy greeted me with a friendly and professionall demeanor and informed me that he will be working with Chris as well.  Both greeted my family, and was very courteous to my wife and son.  They both worked hard on getting into the new vehicle and after that sale was done, assisted me with putting in our car seat, even though is was incredibly hot that day.",5.0
45,"November 29, 2012","In the summer, we purchased a used vehicle and clearly expressed we had certain price limit but had to get into a car. Looked at a few vehicles, found one we thought we could get into. The Sales person kept going back & forth on price and trying to push us from using a specific credit union. Pretty nice people while working the sale however, after sale, not as willing to talk to us about things that were wrong - it was in wreck and damage not fixed, lights issue, tire cover ripped by Sales person, etc. NOW, we have been told the sticker price was over $6K more than the bluebook of the vehicle and we paid at least $5K over - can't refinance or get any help to decrease payments/refinance (due to unforeseen situation we are going through)because of this deception we experienced. Guess we should have tried to find a computer to log into while at dealership, right?!? In addition, the car we traded was in need of some work but we saw it driving next to us less than 1 week later on our way back to the dealership to get seats scotch guarded (if that even happened). Don't think Maxwell had time to fix up our trade that quickly. We initially felt good but now we feel deceived and not happy...and we are stuck in a bad situation.  ",3.0
46,"October 26, 2012","Firist of all, I came to your dealership because of it's easy access to Sun City via Toll 130 and Hwy 79.  I was told over the phone that I should be prepared to leave my 2012 Town & Country Limited for 1 to 1 1/2 days to determine and repair the problem. I advised Justin that I only had one vehicle, that I would have to wait for the work to be done.  It was mentioned that there was a car rental business across the hwy from your dealership.

When traveling to Georgetown, Texas from Iowa, just North of Ft. Worth,  the ""Electronic Throttle Control"", the ""Electronic Stability Control"" and the engine ""Malfunction Indicator Light"" all came on while at the same instant the vehicle lost is power.  It was immediately pulled over to the shoulder and stopped.  I called my Iowa dealer at 5:20 PM, 10/23/12, Rouse Motor Company and Marty Rouse advised that I should start the car.  The only light that stayed on was the ""Malfunction Indicator Light"".  Mr. Rouse advised that I should continue on to Georgetown and that after a few starts, the ""MIL"" would likely go out which it did.  He further advised that I should get it checked out at a Chrysler Dealer.

While waiting for the car in the waiting room (3 hours), Mr. Nyle Maxwell, the dealer, walked into the waiting room and introduced himself. He visited with my wife and I as well as another gentleman for a short time.  He asked what we were in for and how long we had been waiting.  Mr. Maxwell left the waiting room for a few minutes and returned advising that a courtesy car would be furnished so we could go on our way.  His jesture was very much appreciated and allowed us to take care of other things over the next couple of hours in Austin.  Justin called advising the problem was found and repared.  We returned shortly thereafter and picked up our repared vehicle.

Mr Maxwell, thank you so much, for stopping in your customer waiting room and for your kindness.  Our experience turned out to be very positive.  We will return again for service and who knows, some day may need another new Nyle Maxwell dealership automobile.

Again, Thank you.

49,"July 29, 2012","On June 24, 2012 my wife (Virginia) and I visited The Original Nyle Maxwell-Taylor, TX where we received EXTREMELY SUPERIOR customer service and courtesy from Dave Amstutz (Sales Professional) and Coy Balusek (Business Manager). We purchased a 2012 RAM 1500 Quad Cab Lone Star edition with the assistance of Dave after a little wrangling about price and the whole process was quite memorable. 

My wife (Virginia) received a letter from The Nyle Maxwell Supercenter with an offer to buy back her 2008 Caliber and get us into another automobile at the same monthly payment. This made us start researching autos at The Original Nyle Maxwell-Taylor, TX and we called Dave Amstutz for a July 28, 2012 appointment. We were greeted warmly by Dave when we showed up at 9:30am and he had the keys to the 2012 Jeep Patriots we had earlier decided to test drive from our research. Dave pointed out the features of the Patriot to us during our test drive, as he had with the 2012 Ram 1500 that we had purchased in June, and Dave explained briefly that the Jeep we were driving could be the best deal on the lot. Once again with a little give and take from both sides on the price, my wife got herself a new 2012 Jeep Patriot from The Original Nyle Maxwell to drive around town. Now we brag about how easy it was to deal with Dave and Coy and praise the genuine and heartfelt customer service we received.

There is not too often you have dealings with a Car Dealership that make you want to come back, but the Nyle Maxwell team, especially at The Original Nyle Maxwell in Taylor and at the Supercenter is a team to be lauded. My wife and I will always suggest The Original Nyle Maxwell in Taylor to our friends, neighbors and co-workers when they are looking to purchase a new or previously owned automobile.
