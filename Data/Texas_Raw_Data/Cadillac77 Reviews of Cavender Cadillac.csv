0,"January 25, 2020","We became Cavender Cadillac customers when Carlos Villarreal started working there. He had been our service manager for several years at a previous dealership.  Carlos has given us a sense of security in the maintenance of our vehicles. His professional manner, courteous and friendly approach has made him very beloved by us. We jokingly laugh that we feel like he is family and we would quit going to Cavender if he ever leaves. Recently my husband passed away and when I had to purchase another vehicle I realized I had never bought a car by myself. So I experienced another person who works there. My salesperson was Glenn Galloway. He reassured me and talked me through this experience with professionalism, courtesy and and patience. He helped me find a car I love, explained every detail of the transaction and patiently demonstrated how all of the “bells and whistles” worked on my car. I greatly appreciate him and would recommend him to anyone looking to buy a car. Cavender Cadillac is a very professional dealership and I would recommend them to anyone. All of the staff there are very professional, friendly and make you feel so comfortable.",5.0
1,"March 04, 2018","My wife and I purchased a vehicle from Cavender Cadillac. Ken Bennett is our salesman. He treated us as if we are royalty. He gave us multiple options to take with us to review at home. His customer service is impeccable. Ken is very knowable in the automotive industry. His experience will be valuable in helping you stay in your budget and purchasing the vehicle of your dreams. He goes out of his way to greet us every time we have our vehicle serviced. The waiting area is very relaxed and customer focused. The service department from check in to the cashier and check out has gone above and beyond every requirement that I have requested. I will purchase another vehicle from Cavender in two years as a result of the way I have been treated and the quality of the Cadillac they sale.

2,"March 04, 2018","I purchased a beautiful certified CTS Coupe from Kevin James.  He is the type of salesman that you would absolutely look for when buying a vehicle.  He has a family style personality, non pushy approach and made me feel very comfortable along the way.  I am a very Type A individual so in saying that it was important to me that Kevin followed up with all my questions and I felt comfortable throughout the process.  He most certainly did, Kevin called when he said he would and followed up with all my unanswered questions.  He took his time with me and made sure I was confident with all the features on the vehicle before driving off for the first time.  I would absolutely recommend my family and friends to purchase a vehicle from Kevin James, he met all my expectations.",5.0

We purchased another Escalade and the process couldn't have been any easier. If you are looking for a new Cadillac I would definitely recommend Cavender Cadillac!,5.0

5,"April 22, 2013","I had the pleasure of purchasing a Cadillac CTS through Cavander Cadillac, and I'm very pleased with the overall costumer service from the moment I made contact with my salesman Kevin James.  I did the entire process through the internet and over the phone because I'm not from San Antonio, and Kevin along with the rest of the staff i dealt with were very professional and treated me and my wife with the upmost respect.  They even went as far as to personally deliver the car right to my doorstep.  I have to say that i am extremely happy with Kevin James and the rest of the Cavender Cadillac family!  I would definetley visit and buy from this dealership again, and without a doubt, recommend this dealership to my family and friends! 2 THUMBS UP!!!!",5.0
6,"April 15, 2013","I live in Del Rio Texas and the dealerships down here couldn't offer the car I wanted, in the condition I wanted, For the price I wanted.  I put in quote requests on USAA.com.  San Antonio is about 3 hours away however thats where I was receiving all of notifications from regarding my quote.  Dealers had been calling me all day and night, so much so I wanted to pull my request.  However when I got Kevin's email not only was he courteous he always made sure to call during respectable hours, unlike most of the other dealers who contacted me.  Not only that he went out of his way to accomodate the distance providing me the highlest level of fidelity for any and every inquiry I made.   I had a friend bring me to San Antonio to see the car because I haven't had the best experience with buying used vehicles so even though Kevin was a wonderful individual I couldn't just take his word for it.  When I got there the deal was complete within about 30 mins.  I told Kevin on the phone  ""If I drive all the way to San Antonio I want to ""Turn and Burn""   "" Meaning I wanted to get up there, get the car, and head back, and he made sure that I was able to do that by having EVERYTHING prepared, he even had a back up plan if I changed my mind on the vehicle I had pre-selected.  The staff at the dealership were very pleasant and polite, and their efforts seemed very genuine.  When I left there I felt like I had just got a great deal, on a great car, I didn't feel like I had been taken advantage of, or swindled like you feel after leaving some dealerships.  Kudos to the entire Cavender Cadillac team!",5.0
7,"April 11, 2013","While we have been Cavender Cadillac customers for a number of years, this was our first experience with Larry Sullivan.  (Our former salesperson, Bob Davis, retired.)  Mr. Sullivan was professional in every way.  His approach to the sale was thorough and he answered all our questions.  When follow-up was necessary, he was quite prompt.  I never felt any sort of pressure.  I felt that every aspect of the deal offered was as good or better than we were offered elsewhere.  Yes, we did look at other dealerships and one is much closer to out home but we feel that a slight inconvenience of distance is worth the care we have become accustomed to from Cavender.  I would welcome the opportunity to deal with Mr. Sullivan again and I make these comments without reservation.

8,"April 03, 2013","To the entire Cavender team I want to say thank you for the finest auto buying experience I have ever had, and especially to Mr. James. 

To Mr. Cavender, I’m a young family man and I was concerned about the safety of my wife and daughter in a vehicle, and that is what lead me to your establishment.That’s where I met Mr. James. I was in old pants and a work shirt and Mr. James greeted me as if I were a fancy millionaire, a firm hand shake and a plethora of knowledge about the model I was looking at, never once did he judge me for the appearance or age. Mr. James is the biggest reason I bought a car from your establishment, a true professional; friendly, fair and most importantly honest with business, the old fashioned way. My family has been buying cars form there since I was a boy and my grandfather always said, ""There is nothing like a Cadillac"", and ill say, ""There's nothing like Cavender Cadillac"".


Gratefully,

9,"March 20, 2013","My husband and I recently bought a pre owned vehicle from Cavender Cadillac and it was the easiest and best car experience we've had!  Larry Sullivan was  fantastic. I was very specific, knowing the exact car I was interested in. We thoroughly appreciate that he never tree to sell us another vehicle despite this one being a little higher mileage than the banks liked. We have already recommended Larry & Cavender Cadillac to several people and are looking forward to purchasing with them again. ",5.0
10,"March 16, 2013","Kevin James is absolutely top notch.  The 2010 Sebring purchased is for our daughter.  Dad bought the car in San Antonio and Kevin had it transported to Arkansas to our daughter.  The transport driver, Harry, was also wonderful.  Every step of the way Kevin was thoughtful and thorough.  He has followed up with our daughter to assure everything is taken care of.  Even if you are out-of-state, Kevin is state-of-the-art!!
We will definitely be back.
Thanks,

11,"March 07, 2013","This was our first meeting with Larry Sullivan, as we went in to see our car in person. We found it on the internet. We felt very comfortable with Larry as the conversations went on. He has a nice aurora about the way he handles his business. We would call him our friend.
As for Cavender Cadillac downtown, the people are very nice and were not in your face, pushing a sale. Compared to Cavender Toyota and Ancira Chevrolet. We recommend buying a car from Cavender Cadillac.

12,"March 05, 2013",Awesome experience - so good I traded in two cars and bought two cars.  Larry is a bulldog at getting you the deal you need and Roger in Finance is a tireless warrior in seeing that everything is taken care of to your satisfaction.

15,"February 10, 2013","I researched on the internet and circled 4 dealerships I was going to visit. By geographic default I was the closest to Cavender so I had stopped there first. Kevin was wonderful to work with, not pushy, completely genuine and really super nice.  Mentally, I was just looking and going to go home after visiting the different places then make my comparisons but it didn’t happen that way. Kevin and his manager (Ed) really went out of their way to work with me and I really appreciated that. This is my first experience buying a car at the first place but I would do it all again.  Thank you guys!",5.0
16,"February 01, 2013","I RECENTLY PURCHASED A CADILLAC ESCALADE FROM CAVENDER CADILLAC IN SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS. KEVIN JAMES WAS MY SALESMAN &I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THIS IS PERSONALLY THE BEST SALESMAN I HAVE EVER PURCHASED A VEHICLE FROM. FROM THE FIRST DAY THAT I HAD SPOKEN WITH HIM ON THE PHONE HE WENT OUT OF HIS WAY, FROM PICS TO VIDEOS KEVIN SENT ME EVERYTHING I NEEDED TO ASSURE ME THAT THIS WAS MY DREAM CAR. SINCE THIS WAS ONLINE I WAS NERVOUS ABOUT TRUSTING THE PICS AND THE VIDEOS BUT I CAN MOST DEFFINATELY SAY YOUR EYES ARE NOT FOOLED!! THE CAR WAS EVEN BETTER IN PERSON!! I FELT CONVINCED ENOUGH THAT THIS VEHICLE WAS IN EXCELLENT CONDITION SO I WENT THROUGH WITH IT AND PURCHASED THE VEHICLE. THE BEST THING ABOUT IT IS THAT SINCE I LIVED SO FAR AWAY KEVIN BROUGHT MY CAR TO ME! I NEVER ONCE TOOK A STEP ON THE DEALERSHIP IT WAS ALL DONE FROM HOME! HE MADE SURE I WOULDNT HAVE TO STRUGGLE TO MAKE TIME TO GET OUT THERE SINCE IT WAS SO FAR. I JUST ABSOLUTELY LOVE LOVE LOVE MY CAR! AS KEVIN SAYS ""ONCE YOU GO ESCALADE YOU NEVER GO BACK""!!I GIVE HIM A 10+ FOR EXCELLENT SERVICE AND I CAN DEFENITELY SAY THAT I AM GOING TO GO BACK WHEN ITS TIME FOR MY NEXT ESCALADE :) ASK FOR KEVIN JAMES HE WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN!!!",5.0

18,"January 16, 2013","A close friend if mine is an avid Cadillac driver and I reached out to him when we needed a new car for my wife.  My wife was fairly specific on the car/color she wanted. Ed contacted me initially to make intros and find out our wants. Initially, they did not have the color on their lot but found one on a sister lot.  They contacted that lot and Larry delivered the Cadillac in our drive way that next day.  They allowed us to keep it over the weekend to test drive and that sealed the deal.  It was an amazing experience.  Then about 2 months later my Tahoe cratered after 136000 miles.  I went into Cavendar, grabbed Larry and we hit the lot.  We found the Cadillac that best fit my needs and again took it over a weekend and sealed the deal.  Both experiences with Larry were awesome.  He is to the point and gets you what you want.  Thanks to Cavendar we are a dual Cadillac family.  ",5.0
19,"January 11, 2013","The staff at Cavender Cadillac proved to be a team of dedicated professionals that made our buying experience a real pleasure! 

My wife and I's purchase required a little more work than usual. Our salesman, Mark Mauricio, Ed Noriega and even Billy Cavender worked with us until we were completely satisfied with the price and what we were looking for in a new cadillac.It was also a real pleasure working with Roger Espinosa as we finalized the deal in financing. 

We appreciate the effort by your team and love the new CTS!

20,"December 18, 2012","Looking to see what Cadillac had to offer. Was introduced to Mr. Jerry Larrumbide by one of the used car sales men (very courteous sales person). Mr. Jerry was very nice and really knew his product. He showed such patience, not rushing to explain or show us different colors and least of all not pushing to make a sale like others have done at other different dealers. Made us feel very comfortable, thank-you Mr. Larrumbide",5.0
21,"December 10, 2012","Was greeted by Kevin James in the parking lot of the Dealership and he showed me the vehicle my wife and I were looking for.  He was friendly, curtious, and was not pushy.  I have had less than pleasant experiences in the past with car dealerships and was afraid of the same at Cavender.  However, this was not your typical experience.  The people treated you with respect, kindness, and were genuinely concerned about how they could help and make the experience as pleasant as possible.

I commend Cavender and all of the people I met during my purchase.  They have easily earned a customer for life.  And the best part is, they did it by treating my like a person...

Kevin is a great salesman and I would recommend going through him to purchase your next vehicle.  He made it easy and the expression on my wifes face when the car was delivered was priceless!

THANKS CAVENDER CADILLAC!!!!

31,"September 16, 2012","We found this vehicle while looking online. I called the dealership and visited with Ed Noriega who treated me with the utmost respect and professionalism. I told Mr. Noriega my wife and I were driving to San Antonio from Kerrville which is 65 miles away. Mr Noriega assured me the vehicle in question was on the property and would be available for our test drive when I arrived. 

Upon arrival Mr Noriega and Kevin James welcomed my wife and I and took us to the freshly cleaned vehicle for review. After a thorough test drive and explanation of all questions Kevin James invited me inside the dealership to strike a deal. I stated a few items of correction that I desired for the vehicle and was assured if I purchased the vehicle all desires would be met.

The negotiation process was professional and swift. I made what I knew was a fair and reasonable offer, which they accepted and then thanked me sincerely for the business. I told them I needed to leave for a few hours to take care of some business in town and would sign the paperwork when I returned.

True to their word, when I returned Mr James met me and took me to the appropriate office for a surprisingly simple and swift process of purchasing the vehicle.

If this was not enough, because the vehicle needed to be detailed and serviced the next morning, Mr James offered to deliver my vehicle to Kerrville FREE Of Charge. When it arrived the next day, it was spotlessly cleaned, all asked for corrections were done and it was full of fuel.

This was the most pleasant experience I have ever had purchasing a vehicle. When it is time for my next vehicle purchase I will certainly begin my search with Cavender Cadillac.

32,"September 14, 2012","I was impressed with both Larry and Ed. I was interested in an used vehicle and from the minute I was on the car lot, Larry put me at ease with a non-aggressive attitude which was very refreshing, the test drive was a good period for me to get a feel for the car, but what really impressed me was the manner in which the deal got done, Ed was involved and was very friendly, no pressure no b.s, just straight forward friendly answers and comments. They were honest in what they could do. I really found this helpful and felt I was treated with respect. Quality service clearly comes from the top at this dealership, Ed is a great guy to be running a dealership and Larry was great, what a sales person should be in my opinion .I'm moving the servicing of my wife's car over to these guys, as they know how to take care of the customers. Very impressed with what is normally an unimpressive industry. Well done guys,",4.8

34,"September 11, 2012","My experience with Mr. Maiden was just excellent, so easy and most enjoyable.  I am a repeat customer and it is because of Mr. Maiden.  I found him very professional and a pleasure to deal with.
Cavender is fortunate to have Mr. Maiden in their organization.  I lost my husband, Col. Jim Morgan, last year, and I dreaded to shop for a new car; but he made it so easy for me.  He has called me often to check on things.  I appreciate that.  I would recommend Mr. Maiden, and Cavender, to anyone.
I am enjoying my new CTS and  I am convinced that I made the right decision.",5.0
35,"September 06, 2012","MARTIN VARA is a very Fantastic person!!  Although his position at Cavender is that of a Salesman, he goes far and beyond the definition of a Salesman.  He makes you feel like family. He calls to check on you to see how you're doing and then how's your vehicle going.  If you have questions that can be answered by him, he will answer them. If it is something for another department, he contacts that department and calls you back with a status report Immediately!! I know from experience, once the deal is finalized, trying to talk to someone is virtually impossible. Not with Martin!!

So Martin, my friend, may God continue to Bless you, and Mr. Cavender continue to keep you. If I hear of anyone looking to purchase a vehicle (even if it's a 1960 Corvair! A little before your time I'm afraid), you can be assured I will give them your phone number so they can call you and be treated like a valued customer and not a $$$$$$ sign.

Thanks for everything.

36,"September 06, 2012","Having dealt with a number of new car dealerships over the years and one other one recently, I can say without a doubt that Cavender Cadillac is in a league all by itself in terms of quality and professionalism!  Kevin James is as good at his job  they come!  While he was able to interact with me on a personal level, his   professionalism was steadfast in a very satisfying but understated way--just the right way to reach me as a customer.  Sales manager Ed Noriega gets equally high marks for his abiltiy to inspire customer confidence in the dealership and his ability to convey his respect for the customer. Roger Espinosa in finance is another competent professional who can interact with customers on a down to earth personal level while never missing a beat at taking care of all of the important details and covering all of his bases very smoothly.  Dealership owner Billy Cavender is to be congratulated for organizing and maintaining such an excellent dealership.

This is now the second day that I have no car and cannot run errands or fullfill my plans. When I personally spoke to Addison Shepard, I asked for a rental car.  The service manager was going to call us back. No call. They have stalled us, frustrated me to no ends. As of the writing of this E-mail 3pm, I am hearing there is no shuttle driver.  My points of contention:

1.  Take care of your customers.  (You could have been replacing the engine).
2.  I know the corporate rates for rental cars.( Much cheaper than an oil change).
3.  You lose your business ONE customer at a time.
4.  My time is as valuable as yours.
5.  I am going to tell eveerybody I run into about my experience with you for as long 
    as I am ticked off.
6.  I obviously had a good relationship with you before- I bought my car to you.
7.  I will never do business with you again.

Unless you do this all the time you know exactly what car I am talking about.

56,"March 05, 2012","For the last two months, I've been looking to purchase a used Buick Enclave .  After being unsuccessful at various other dealerships in the San Antonio area, I decided to check out Cavender Cadillac and it was the best experience I've had purchasing a car from a dealership.  Kevin was very friendly, upfront and knowledgeable when showing me the car.  He made sure the car was what I wanted and done everything to make sure I got the right price for the quality of the car.  Matter fact, the whole entire Cavender staff was friendly and very accommodating during my visit at the dealership.  The only thing I regret is not making these guys my first choice because it would have saved me a lot of time.",4.8
57,"February 25, 2012","I live in the DC area and my current vehicle was getting expensive on gas and was too big for the area.  I went home to San Antonio with the intentions of possibly getting a new vehicle.  Well after two weeks of searching online and doing my research, one site that was freaquently on top was Cavender Cadillac.  On my spare time, i stopped at the dealership and with my luck I met Mr. Kevin James.  He was very personable and ready to help in any way possible.  I knew from that first moment, I would be purchasing my car from him.  After all my wants and his patience with me, he found what I was looking for.  I was excited and glad I stayed with Cavender.  Both he and Mr. Roger Espinosa, were very helpful and truly wanted me to be happy with my purchase.  I wasn't pressured to buy a vehicle I didn't want.  They were honest and straightforward from the get go.  Kevin took the time to get to know me, not just for a sale, but really know me.  I was at ease, as if I were with family.  I love my Cadillac and thankful for walking onto the Cavendar Cadillac.  Car buying shouldn't be a stressful time with worries of getting taken advantage of.  It should be an easy, smart and exciting experience as I had with them.  Thank you Kevin and Roger, glad to be part of the Cavender family.  These are the gentleman to ask for!

59,"February 13, 2012","I was in the market to purchase a used vehicle from Cavender. When I arrived, I was warmly greeted by a salesman. Everything seemed ok until it was time to view the vehicle that I was interested in. The first thing my wife and I noticed was that the vehicle was dirty inside and out but yet they have an on-site drive-thru car wash less than 10 ft. away. We continued to view vehicle though the passenger seat was not operational. The seat was stuck in a forward position so my wife had to ride in the back seat while I test drove the vehicle. There were also other mechanical issues with the car (not involving the engine) that should have been addressed before the car was put on the lot 7 days ago. These issues were pointed out by myself and my spouse. The salesman was not aware of some of  the issues and was apologetic. If the vehicle is not fully inspected and ready to be sold, don't put it on the lot.  ",3.0

For me working in a big box retailer, I liked the customer service and my parents also have thier vehicles serviced there and like the customer service. I can tell you a dealership doesnt stay in business now a days without good service and their committment to go the extra mile. thanks to Kevin for his professionalism is one reason why I bought my vehicle my Cavender.",4.8

65,"December 13, 2011","To whom it may concern, 
For the past 40 years I have been buying and trading cars and I have never had a dealership provide me with the Red Carper treatment like Cavender Cadillac provided. I can’t say enough positive comments about how Ed and Kevin treated us. It all started on Sunday morning went I found the car on Cavender’s website, as any car buyer, I had a few questions about the car. I submitted a question on their website, thinking I would get a reply on Monday or Tuesday, and low and behold 15 minutes later here comes an email from Ed telling me everything about the car. Never in all my forty-years of car buying has any dealership responded so promptly to my request for more information; this was the first of many positive interactions I had with Ed. We closed the deal on the car and Ed said he would help arrange for deliver of the car to Bloomington, IN. Behind the scenes Ed was orchestrating something special for me, he handed the transportation of the car over to a fellow “Hoosier”, Kevin James. Kevin texted me about the car transportation and assured me that everything was taken care of on his end. Ed told Kevin about the car being a Christmas present for my daughter and Kevin started planning for the surprise. He had the car fully detailed and a huge Christmas bow placed inside for shipment. Since we were leaving for an extended Christmas on Sunday, Kevin arranged with Cory Bragg of Classic Car Transport for the car to received priority shipment and arrived on a Wednesday. I truly wish Ed and Kevin could have been here on Saturday when my youngest daughter got the surprise of her life. All of this happened because of a dealership that is dedicated to customer service. You have not only enriched my daughter’s life, you have gained a lifetime customer.

Sincerely,

Having the flexibility to use the Internet/email to schedule times to meet and have resources (people/vehicles) and paperwork ready helped make the experience extremely time efficient.  The sales staff (Kevin James) was friendly and just great to work with.  He got me the best possible deal on purchase and trade.,5.0

70,"September 20, 2011","No two people had the same answer for any question. If they are gonna try to squeeze a customer for everything they have, maybe being on the same page beforehand would be useful. Customer service? I waited on someone, anyone in the building to ask if I needed help....for 1/2 an hour, but they were too busy admiring a brand new model of a 2 door convertible ""go-cart"". Since my business wasn't needed, I thought I'd walk around the lot and see what was available. They are obviously impressed with their cars by the price tags! Anyone with an iPhone can pull up a dealer invoice and check package deals, options, standard features, incentives, rebates, can look up phony charges if any and you can also look up what the dealer paid for each individual car. I was in the lot walking around alone for such a long time, I actually looked these items up.  Just as I'm walking out of the lot and everyone went back to work, they noticed me. After being approached for a 3rd time, can you guess what I did? Yup....I left and went and bought a brand new FORD!!!",2.0
71,"July 13, 2011","Our experience with Cavender was very rewarding. We looked on-line for a particular vehicle and within minutes, Mr. Koch was calling us. He offered to bring the car/SUV out to our home, This I never expected.  We have purchased many other vehicles before, and we always went to the dealership.
We have been treated with 'kid-gloves' and this is something that not too many busines do today.  Yes,, we are very satisfied with their services.",4.6

I would recommend any person looking for a vehicle to first check out Cavender Cadillac because they will be treated as a person within a greatly net family and not just a paying customer.",5.0

74,"May 24, 2011","We had always driven Chryslers, Pontiacs, and Volkswagens, but in 1991 we became interested in Cadillacs.  We went to a dealership in a city very close to where we live and were totally ignored by every employee we came into contact with.  We walked out!  We don't dress in fancy clothes or wear flashy jewelry, so we had the impression that they were ""judging the books by their covers.""

A few weeks later, we rented a car to drive to Dallas (we just didn't trust our old Pontiac or either one of the Volkswagen Rabbits, to take us that far).  On our way, as we approached San Antonio, which is 150 miles north of our home in deep South Texas, we decided on a whim to stop in at Cavender's Cadillac, as we had seen an ad about them in a magazine.  We walked into the Cavender Cadillac Dealership ""just to look.""  The moment we were inside the door, we were greeted by an employee.  We told him we were just looking, but he went and got a salesman who offered to answer our questions.  We were not pressured, but we were treated with a great deal of respect. To make a long story short, we drove out a few hours later in a beautiful Cadillac Sedan DeVille.

We have gotten a new Cadillac every two years since.  The one we have now is leased for three years.  We drive the 150 miles every chance we get to have our car serviced.  They keep our car for us while we go on vacations.  We know that we can trust them to treat us right and not charge us for repairs that we don't really need. (The cars have always been purchased in my name, but my two sisters and I pay for it equally.  Before we started doing business with Cavender we were always worried that we might be taken advantage of because we are women.  We don't worry about that with Cavender.  They are so trustworthy in every aspect of our dealings with them. 

We feel a deep loyalty to Cavender Cadillac, because everyone who works there from the owner on down have treated us royally for 20 years and they have given us superior service.  ",5.0
