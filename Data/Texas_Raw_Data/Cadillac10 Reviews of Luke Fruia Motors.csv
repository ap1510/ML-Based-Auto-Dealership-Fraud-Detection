0,"July 30, 2017","I took my GMC Acadia to get checked at because the A/C was blowing hot air. They told me it would cost $1,610 to fix and that my vehicle would be ready be Wednesday. Luckily I was able to afford the expense and being that I was going out of town I definitely needed the A/C in this triple digit weather! I picked up vehicle on Wednesday evening and drove home. Then Thursday we left for Arlington to pick up my stepdaughter. About 2 hours into our drive ( 6:30pm or so) I begin to feel rather uncomfortable in the third row and I notice HOT air blowing from  the bottom vents in third row and tepid air from four back top vents!!! I was furious! Of course my $1,600 bill had hurt my pocket and to realize my issue has NOT been resolved I was extremely livid! Needless to say I managed to tolerate the warm air blowing and just fell asleep . It must have been the hot air!!! 

We drove back today and when we got home I noticed that the passengers seat foot area was moist and that plastic covering had condensation on it!!! Then I looked under my Acadia and notified water leaking!!!

If I wanted poor service I would have paid $800 to a mom and pop shop who doesn't ""guarantee"" their work!!!

The service man Mike told me that their work is ""guaranteed"" for a year!!! He should have mentioned ""guaranteed to be faulty""!!! 

Extremely disappointed in the quality of service we received!!! I  am taking it back tomorrow because I do not think it's fair that if it is ""guaranteed for a year"" another dealership should have to incur their faulty labor issues. 

I will definitely be rating the service and informing GMC of the poor service so that maybe they will no longer be a ""certified  service"" location! ",1.8

3,"April 23, 2014","Any experience can be based on one element, but my experiences - note plural - with the staff of Luke Fruia motors has always been exceptional. My motivation for buying and servicing automotibles at Fruia motors is the service, the people, the product, and my satisfaction. I thank the professionals at Fruia motors for their continued support in every aspect of customer service and sales. 

Fruia motors is iconic of what every dealership should be...professional!

5,"November 23, 2011","I sent emails to several GMC / Chevrolet dealerships in the Rio Grande Valley. Mr. Alaniz was one of the first to respond, and the only one who did not immediately pressure me to drive out to his dealership to test drive a vehicle. He quoted me a good price for the 2012 Terrain I was looking for, and worked with me (all online and over the phone) to make sure I had a vehicle I could test drive in my price range and with the features I was looking for.

When we arrived at the dealership he had the car ready for us, answered all of our questions, and let us test drive it extensively. The experience was very relaxed, and several hours later we left with our new vehicle.

I would highly recommend both Mr. Alaniz and Luke Fruia motors for your next vehicle purchase.",4.8
6,"March 24, 2011","I went for a tire rotation as well and all was great. Awsome, quick and smooth. To that customer with the hubcap problem. I dont believe the dealership is at fault. If the hubcap was not installed propperly, it would of come off right away or as soon as you get up to high speed, not 200 miles away, maybe you hit a hard bump, or pothole?",5.0

8,"February 26, 2011","I just want to share that I am so impressed and overwhelmed with Randyâ€™s overall professionalism, patience, knowledge, and sensitivity in helping me acquire the 2009 Cadillac CTS, from your dealership, over the Internet!  And then it was even delivered to me!  It was the most relaxing and productive auto purchasing activity I have ever done!  The car is everything I expected and more...  I definitely will be a returning customer to Luke Fruia Motors, when the right time comes, if they continue to have salesmen of his caliber and expertise.   And yes, I will pass the word around about my satisfying  experience with the Finance Director and, most especially, Mr. Vojvoda...",5.0
9,"January 05, 2011","My sales associate Armando Martinez, was very attentive to my needs, once purchased he spent all the time necessary to explain every detail of the vehicle before I left the dealership. Would I recommend him, absolutely to everyone who asks and that is a great deal of people.",4.8
