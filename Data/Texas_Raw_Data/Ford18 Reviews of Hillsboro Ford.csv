3,"January 16, 2020",I have always been pleased with car purchases and their service.  I have been a customer at Hillsboro Ford way before the owner/name change.  Pam in Service is the best.  She always gets to the problem.  The whole service dept. is good.  They are quick and efficient.,5.0
4,"January 09, 2020","Service department is terrible, the woman named Pam is a dingbat.. she doesn‚Äôt remember what people request to have done. 
We had extended warranty work pre-approved and fixed, they held our vehicle hostage until they received payment from warranty company. This ",1.0
5,"January 08, 2020","While some 30 miles from home, the battery on my 2017 Explorer failed. Ford Roadside assistance responded to my phone call with a few texts. The system worked flawlessly; a roadside service tech was on-site within +/-15 minutes. Once underway, I spoke with Pam at Hillsboro Ford.  She scheduled diagnosis for the starting/charging system and requested that I drop by as soon as I was back in town. Within about 30 minutes, I arrived at the dealership; the problem was confirmed and diagnosed.  Soon a new battery was installed, trouble codes cleared, and I was on the road again!  
Thanks to Ford Roadside Assistance and Hillsboro Ford for taking good care of my Explorer!",5.0
6,"December 09, 2019",More or less was told to take back to the dealership the truck was bought at.  Would not recommend Hillsboro Ford.  I was told they cleaned the oil leak but did not know where it was coming from to drive it a couple of days and bring back.  Was charged for this also.,1.0

14,"June 28, 2019","I want to say that im working out of town in Hillsboro &  Ms. Pam & Allen had my situation in mind when they took care of my steering gearbox failure. Im a inspector on a construction site & have to be on site during work being conducted. So, being out of my truck was not an option. They put me in a loaner car while they repaired my truck that afternoon. They had me back in my truck the same day ! Amazing service and awesome concern for my situation ! 
I would absolutely recommend them !!!

17,"May 13, 2011","I purchased a Nissan Maxima from Michael Bull.  He assured me that their mechanics had done a thorough check of everything on the vehicle and it was excellent. For some reason, I actually trusted him. I purchased the car. The second month I had it, the cruise control stopped working. I had to have that fixed. The mechanic I took the car to to fix the cruise control said that any good mechanic could have looked at the steering column and known that the airbag had been deployed at some point. That was what messed up the cruise control. The trunk no longer closed and latched after the third month. I have had to replace the tires. Now in the fifth month of owning the car, I am facing repair on the voltage regulator or the alternator. I previously spoke with Mr. Bull who was no help.  I spoke with Mr. Cole (the owner of the dealership) who could have obviously cared less. Small town dealerships have honest and helpful employees and owners. Not at this dealership.  I do not believe I have been treated fairly.  I have spent over $1000 on repairs in the 5 months I have owned this 2006 Nissan Maxima that underwent a THOROUGH inspection by their mechanics. For what I paid for the car, I should not be experiencing all of these problems now. No matter the fact that it is a used vehicle.",1.6
