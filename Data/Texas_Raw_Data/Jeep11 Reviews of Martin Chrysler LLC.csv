2,"December 08, 2017","Debbie was FABULOUS!! 
We were so thankful for all her efforts, she ensured we didn't just ""settle"" .. she found what we were looking for and had it ready for us within hours!! 
The service from consultation, to estimating, to finance, to delivery was outstanding.
Each time we called or stopped by, everyone knew what was going on, everything was well communicated with everyone, including us.
Thank you so much for our early Christmas present!!

3,"November 16, 2017","I was looking at purchasing a truck from this dealership and I have talked to many dealerships the past few weeks however never been insulted the way I was here by the sales manager. I had 2 immaculate vehicles (even complimented by the sales rep and manager) that I was willing to trade in, only to be insulted when I told him his offers were too low based on what other dealers offered me. This is absolutely not a way to do business with any customer but like he said they are a “small dealer” and most likely will stay that way considering the customer care I was shown. It’s truly a shame because now I won’t even entertain the idea of driving 6 hours to try and negotiate a deal. Thanks Martin Dodge for saving me a trip to a dealership that only is interested in profit. ",1.0
4,"September 29, 2017",I have returned to this dealer on a regular basis.  They are the best in the Houston area.  The 30 minute drive from Kingwood is worth it.  They always shoot straight and are very honest.  No high pressure to sell you what you don't need.  I never have a problem setting appointments and they always have it finished when they have commited to a time. I will continue to go to this dealer and recommend  it to others.,5.0
5,"March 03, 2017","This is the best dealership!! Great prices, no pressure sales, excellent service. If you are looking for a dealership that you want to keep returning to when it's time to buy a new car ... this is the one! We have purchased 7 cars from these folks and it has been the same sales, floor manager, and finance manager for each one. That says a lot to us so we keep going back. ",5.0

7,"August 15, 2016",This was the easiest car buying experience I have ever had.  Jody was just the best salesperson I think I have ever worked with.  They will definitely get my return business as well as any referral I can make.  If there was a rating past excellent they would get it!,5.0
8,"July 26, 2016","This dealership  is conveniently  located just  off Hwy.59 S in Cleveland, Texas, and the people there are truly friendly.  They make you feel more like family than a customer. The dealership is very clean and easy to  navigate around in  to  look at their inventory as well as a few  accessories you  might be interested in.
A great experience in car/truck buying than  I have had in a VERY long time. You won't be disappointed here, unless you  don't buy here !!
All the staff will be glad to  help. The person that  helped me  was Jody Wilkerson.
She is very knowledgeable of the inventory they have on hand and will  do  all she can to  see to it that  you are satisfied with  your purchase.
Check them out when  you  are ready or considering a new vehicle, you won't be sorry.",5.0

10,"March 22, 2016","From the moment we walked into Martin Chrysler in Cleveland, Texas we were treated so well.  Your salesman Justin Snipes is the best I have ever dealt with anywhere.  Your service department is always polite and quickly resolves problems or completes the service we bring it in for.

I would recommend anyone to your dealership!

My husband is a mechanic and also has a Jeep.  He tells me he will be taking his Jeep in for any needs now rather than making repairs himself.  That says allot.  He has always done things himself on our vehicles.",4.8
