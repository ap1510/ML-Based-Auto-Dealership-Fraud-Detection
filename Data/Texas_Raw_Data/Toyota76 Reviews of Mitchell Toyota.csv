1,"September 16, 2019","This is the second time I've had my Sienna there for service, and both times it's been a miserable experience. I've had the same advisor both times and she is incredibly rude. My work schedule makes it nearly impossible to make appointments, some days I get off at 10am, others 5pm and I know it sounds weird but I never know until I get there what it's going to be. Today I needed a simple flat repair and tire rotation, it look 90 minutes for the flat repair and then she said she couldn't get the rotation done without an appointment. It's a 15 minute job. I get that they're busy, but surely there's some way they could work it in, but she wouldn't have it. I try to always go to dealership service centers, but thanks to the treatment here I'll go elsewhere from now on.",1.0

3,"September 27, 2018","I was looking for a RAV4 and David Turner was extremely happy to assist us and answer all of our questions.  Although not ready to buy, the prices and information that David provided me allowed to think it through and make a final decision the same day.  Although it was after lunch when we went back and told David we would purchase, he was grateful for returning and said he would stay until we drove off the lot in our new vehicle.  David Turner is an outstanding  and exceptional salesman and it was a pleasure doing business without the hassle of prices.  I highly recommend Mitchell Toyota.",5.0
4,"August 02, 2018","Our experience with Mitchell Toyota began with a search on Edmunds webpage. The information there was very good with led us to contact the dealership and we spoke to David ""Coach"" Turner. We received nothing but an excellent service from him. We travelled more than 3 hours to the dealership and were treated with respect, interest and excellent service. David set us up, Carlos Dehoyos helped us through the finances. The place is clean, friendly and determined to serve. We really appreciate David sticking with us, albeit the distance, via emails, calls and messages, until we finally were able to get to San Angelo, check the vehicle out and make the purchase. We would highly recommend dealership for their service, friendliness and graciousness.",5.0

7,"July 25, 2018","David Turner was great, giving me the information I needed to make a decision without pressuring me. I love my RAV4. Wish it had a better visible speedometer, but it is way more visible than my Prius was, so it works. Found out after I bought it that my new smartphone is not smart enough to work with the Toyota Entune stuff. Disappointing but not major.  Overall a great experience, and that is a first! ",4.8
8,"July 08, 2018","I went into Mitchell Toyota and Ernest Garcia was the only car sales man in town to contact me back and work to find me the right truck. He continued until he found the right vehicle and was also able to negotiate a great price. I am very happy with the truck. Get this man a bigger office!! Thanks Ernest
Beyond the interaction with Ernest, it seemed like a normal car dealership. Nothing negative about the place. ",5.0

11,"May 02, 2018",David and Carlos both made buying a new-to-me vehicle a pleasant experience!  Each of them were friendly and efficient through every step of the process. I highly recommend David as a great salesman if you're looking for a good previously owned car; and Carlos will get you the best financing available. Happy car shopping!! ,5.0

15,"November 21, 2017","I rarely give rave reviews to any company any more and generally refrain from reviewing any business unless I believe it is truly deserving. Mitchell Toyota stands out, however, as a place where I have never experienced anything but top-rate service and treatment. They are a reminder that it is about the customer. ",4.8
16,"October 22, 2017","I had the pleasure once again to buy from Mitchell Toyota and again they went well beyond what I expected from a dealership. My sales lady Janel was the best by far from any sales person ive every had. I bought 2 (two) 2017 Toyota 86's and a 2017 Toyota Tundra yesterday and the whole sales team made it all happen. I got my son his first new car and they made him the happiest young man in town. I cant say enough good things about the whole team there and the experience ive had with the service department in the past is just as exceptional. If you in the market to buy a auto, at least give them an chance to see what they can do for you. They will do their best to make it happen for you. Again, thanks a million guys....",5.0
17,"September 22, 2017","I live in Midland and was doing online shopping.  I noticed a vehicle that I was interested in and did an internet inquiry.  Within minutes I received a reply and shortly thereafter David Dyer contacted me by phone.  We discussed the sale and finalized the deal over the phone.  Since my wife is handicapped and could not travel to San Angelo, David brought the deal to us.  He delivered the vehicle and we did all the paperwork at our house.  He went over the vehicle with us and set up the garage door opener with homelink.  This has been the most stress free vehicle experience of my life.  If you live  within a reasonable distance of San Angelo, you owe it to yourself to give this dealership a chance to earn your business.  You will not be disappointed.",5.0
18,"September 21, 2017","Juan Cruz salesman fot MT was excellent from arranging the sales, personalizing, delivering, and setting up the technology! He was extremely helpful and I would definitely go back with Mr. Cruz and the whole team again! Thank you and we love our 4 Runners!",5.0
19,"June 23, 2017","I'm from out of town and wasn't planning on purchasing a new vehicle. I passed by Mitchell Toyota after hours and spotted a truck that I truly liked so I stopped to look. I contacted the dealership when I returned home  and immediately was contacted by Thor Quintanilla. I told him what I wanted and the price I wanted and it was no problem. We worked the deal and I came and got it. Thor was knowledgeable, friendly, respectful, and energetic. If something wasn't right he fixed it right away. Thor is  by far the best salesperson I have worked with hands down.",5.0
20,"June 13, 2017","Juan Ozuna guided us through our third Toyota purchase (our second with him).  He was knowledgeable about the Honda we were in, and more importantly, was able to confidently compare and contrast the Camry to the Civic.  This was before he even walked us over to a model we could test drive.  Everything he told us was borne out during the drive.  We really appreciated his no pressure approach.  He went over the features the Camry would offer, and explain why some of the features we were curious about would only be available in another level.  But we were and still are content with our choice.  Juan's approach was low-key, but he is exceedingly perceptive to what his customers want/need.  
We have become Toyota devotees.
Thank you!",4.8
21,"June 01, 2017",We've purchased 4 Toyotas from Mitchell and have had an excellent experience each time. We bought 3 from Gary Mortensen before he retired and one from David Dyer. Both were knowledgable and service focused. It starts at the front door when you are warmly greeted by someone who wants to be of help. ,4.8
22,"May 09, 2017","We drove 600 miles round trip plus to get our car. Curtis Andrews was absolutely marvelous. So helpful, knowledgeable and patient with us. We're seniors and electronically challenged. These newer vehicles present obstacles not easily overcome. We've been driving a 20 year old Buick Roadmaster. We love our 2015 Volvo. Probably make that long drive again should the need arise. Hopefully not any time soon. Couldn't be happier with our experience. ",4.8

24,"February 10, 2017","While we were on vacation, our Lexus developed GPS ""freeze""--obviously, very problematic while traveling.  We were close to San Angelo, so stopped by Mitchell to see whether it could be fixed.  They took us in immediately, diagnosed and repaired the problem and treated us as regular customers.  Not only that, they refused any reimbursement for the work.  We would rate them as SUPER in the customer service area and highly recommend them---wish they were in our hometown!",5.0

I really appreciated that Gary Mortenson- Internet Sales- responded promptly and thoroughly to the numerous questions I asked (both via phone and email)which helped me make my vehicle choice before my arrival.

Velton Taylor is a jewel. The day he retires Mitchell Toyota will be at a great loss. Stay healthy Velton.

37,"October 12, 2015","I've been coming to Mitchell Toyota since I moved to West Texas two years ago. I moved from Houston and had to adjust quite a bit to West Texas. After two years I now happily call San Angelo home. 

I've always had my Prius serviced at Mitchell Toyota unless I happened to be in Houston when I needed to have my oil changed or whatever. My perception of the differences between the two is that Houston isn't as customer friendly because there's so many people in the area that they know they'll make a sale to someone or be their service provider. However, my experience with Mitchell Toyota has always, WITHOUT exception, been one of respect, professionalism, and a constant desire to make the customer happy. 

Once a business has proven to me that they will consistently treat me with respect and always provide me with excellent service, I become a customer for life. I look forward to buying all my future Toyotas from here as well as having them serviced in their excellently staffed service department. 

I'm one very happy customer,

38,"October 04, 2015","Walked into San Angelo, Mitchell Toyota looking for a Sequoia to fulfill the needs of my growing family. I was in contact with the internet sales guy (Gary) for over a week and when we finally made it in, he started off very friendly, interested. He walked us around showing us a few sequoias. He then asked me what amount of monthly payment I was looking for, and I replied with $450-$500. Of course I'm not an idiot and realize that it might take some give on my part to make it work....But once i said that number he almost rolled his eyes in thinking "" great another unreasonable customer that wants it all for nothing"" He was obviously no longer interested in entertaining my ideal car payment. He immediately started steering us towards other vehicles, "" have you heard of a 4 runner? "" lets look at something more your price range""...Really? If I wanted a freaking 4 runner, I would have come in and asked for it...
He never even asked how much I was going to put down!!! He didn't ask questions to get to know me. He turned pretty snobby in saying that he can't drop down the price on a 2015 Sequoia, I felt as if he was pushing us out the door and saying go shop somewhere cheaper! After that he just said that he would be in touch if he ever found a vehicle in my price range. What a snob. He showed no interest at all. His loss cause I had a check in my pocket for 16,000$ down! After the way he treated us , there was no way he was getting my money. I made one call to Kyle Corr in Abilene Toyota and within a few days He had not only the Sequoia we wanted and color, but in a brand new 2016, for $1,000 less than the 2015 at Mitchell. !. He was great in communicating with me on wants, needs, and options. I never felt pressured to buy. He answered my call on a few occasions when he was on his off day!! He never ignored me. They didn't even have the sequoia, they had to drive it down from Dallas! It takes that little bit of extra effort to get my business. He did that and then some. We went through USAA for financing and they tried to match it. At least they tried. They were very honest and friendly guys. 
The only reason they didn't get 5 stars was at the end I had expressed that we wanted to get on the road in a hurry because we had an hour and half drive back to San Angelo, And  i didn't want my wife and 5 month old twin girls to drive back in the dark. I mentioned that I wasn't interested in any warranties, and they still took me to the back room away from my wife and kids and tried the sales pitch again. I had already said no. What part don't they understand. I understand its part of the process but I already anticipated the "" let me get so- and so so they can explain the options to you"" So i already said no. It made our experience driving home terrible cause both girls were done sitting in car seats and strollers so it was a cry fest all the way back home in our new Sequoia. Other than that Kyle Corr was Awesome, great representation of the quality training they give their employees. I will always recommend him and Lithia Toyota to everyone I meet. Stay away from Mitchell in San Angelo, they are snobby and don't care.Snobby In San Angelo?!!! Don't get it...!",1.0

48,"July 16, 2013",Velton Taylor made my experience of trading for a new car very easy.  He took time to show me all the vehicles that I might be interested in and the differences between them.  Made the decision on my Hylander a very easy one.  He explained how everything in the vehicle worked which I really appreciated.  Shon Jones made the financial part go smoothly and made sure I was happy with the deal.  Easiest vehicle trade I have done in several years!,5.0
49,"July 14, 2013","I usually wait several weeks before leaving any kind of review for many reasons. First I want to see if the product that I have purchased is going to have any problems.  I also knew that I was seriously considering paying the truck off by my first pymnt, only for the reason that I hate being in debt. This also lets me see if I am going to have any difficulties w/ the financial institution.  My experience overall,  has been very very positive w/ Mitchell Toyota.  My salesman Oscar Ornales could not have been better,  He was so helpful and knowledgeable about what I wanted and put me in the truck that I wanted at a reasonable price. TFS was also so pleasant and helpful to me.  This is why I have choosen to give a high rating.  I will be back in 5-6 yrs.for a new truck.

52,"July 01, 2013","Our experience of purchasing a car from Toyota-Kia was great.  Gary Mortenson, our Sales Rep,  was attentive with phone calls and e-mail when I was searching for the perfect car after driving my former vehicle for 19 years.   He searched tirelessly for what I wanted and finally found the car for me in a neighboring city.  After purchasing the car, Gary went over all the features of the car with my husband and I.  If we didn't understand, he would patiently go over questions with us.  I think he did an exceptional job.
Price wise, I just rated it OK because I had to take extra features with the ""package deals"" I did not want, nor need.  Wish you could just select what you wanted like in the olden days, but it doesn't work that way any more I am told. 
As for the quality of work, I can't rate it as we just purchased the car 5 days ago.  Gary did introduce us to the Service Dept. manager and the 2 year Toyota Care package was once again explained to us.  Gary showed us around the facility which I thought was very nice.
