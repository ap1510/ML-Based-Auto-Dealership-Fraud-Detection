Joe did a great job with my info, and my 2020 Murano was delivered to my door within 36 hours of my initial contact!! Love my car, matched the price I asked for! I’ll go back here again!",5.0
1,"February 18, 2020","We searched the web looking for an appropriate car for our family. We inquired about a particular vehicle that was on the Pre-Own lot for Southwest Nissan. The internet salesperson Luis Garcia immediately reached out to me. I did not schedule a time at this point. On a Friday evening my wife and I were in Weatherford so we randomly  dropped by to see the vehicle. In turn, we did not like this particular car but my wife spied one next to it she absolutely loved. Luis and his Managers were so helpful and courteous. We actually had an appointment with another dealer to view a vehicle that they had but the staff at SW Nissan impressed us so much that we immediately returned to see Luis Garcia and his Managers to purchase our new Nissan Armada. Southwest Nissan and Luis Garcia just earned a new customer for life as far as we are concerned. Highly recommend this dealership! Go see Luis! #verypleasedcustomer",5.0
2,"January 07, 2020","Worked with Luis and Jesse in the used car department on pricing, gave them the email address to send the bank draft, offered to put $3,000 down on vehicle, told them we would be back around 7:00 pm to finalize everything. Called at 6:00 and spoke directly with Luis and told him we were on our way. Arrived at dealership at 7:00.  Another couple was looking at the car. Luis assured us the car was ours. He distracted us and let us test drive the car again. Again assuring us the car was ours.  Waited around 30 minutes for him to tell the other couple the car was ours. Waited another few minutes and he finally came in and told us he had sold the car to the other couple. Don't trust this company. Jesse never even sent the bank draft either.  No wonder people say he's about as trustworthy as a used car salesman? If I could give this dealership a 1/2 star I would!",1.0
3,"October 28, 2019","Went to look at a used car, and it was so dirty out on the lot I should have walked away at this point. Ryan agreed to have it cleaned up and ready in a couple of days. Then the car was in an accident while it was being fueled. So here I am stuck with a rental for 3 weeks, and the only response from the staff is ""Not out fault, nothing we can do"" ",2.0
4,"September 02, 2019","After having a very bad experience at another Nissan dealership in Burleson TX, we went to Southwest Nissan in Weatherford TX, and had a great buying experience. Their selling price was the one they had listed, and the trade was valued fairly, and most importantly no hidden fees. All of the managers were attentive and straight forward, and the sales person was very helpful. I would buy from them again and recommend them to anybody.",5.0
5,"July 24, 2019","I purchased a 2017 Titan XD in late December,  2017 at Southwest Nissan through a salesman named Skip Seaman.  Although the purchase made had its challenges, they managed to find a vehicle equipped the way that I wanted from another dealer and Skip delivered it to me in Stephenville, TX early in 2018.

No problems until 2019 when I was involved in an accident in the vehicle.  The vehicle was repaired at a local body shop, NOT Southwest Nissan.  

After getting my repaired vehicle back, I had a relatively simple question that I needed answered from someone at the dealership.  I called and found that Skip Seaman was no longer employed there.  I called back and asked the person answering the phone to let me speak to a sales manager, as I figured the question I had could not be answered by a regular salesperson.  Instead of a sales manager  I was transferred to a salesperson named Demarcus.  I decided to explain my problem and request to him.  As I suspected, he couldn't answer my question without consulting with someone else, but he said that he would and get back to me in ~40 minutes.  No call back came from him...in 40 minutes, or the rest of the day OR even the next day!

So, the next day, I again tried to call and talk to a sales manager.  The first two times I called someone named Cheyenne answered.  Each time, she transferred me to some generic ""voicemail"" box.  Rather than leave a message to some person whose name I did not even know, or if that particular voicemail even had an owner, I hung up after determining there was NO OPTION to get back to Cheyenne or another REAL person without hanging up and calling back.  Their phone system SUCKS, folks!

Finally  the third time I called, a person named Julie answered the phone.  After explaining my frustration with their phone system, I again asked for a sales manager.  Julie appeared to actually check if one was available.  She came back on the line and said the sales manager was helping another customer, but she got my name and number and assured me he would call me back as soon as he was free.
I asked what his name was and she said that I would receive a call back from Anthony Snyder.  

Guess what, folks?  It has been over 24 hours now and no call from Anthony Snyder or anyone else from Southwest Nissan!

Even though I was referred to this dealership by Ed Wallace and his website, I guess I spent my money at the wrong Nissan dealership.  Perhaps those reading this should think twice before shopping at Southwest Nissan.  It appears to me that their advertised ""commitment to great customer service"" comes to an end once they have your money in their pocket.

6,"July 22, 2019","I live 2 hrs away. Called in and talked to Tony Ballard and asked if he had a specific Murano in stock and he said yes. Asked for a specific price. Tony texted me back a short while later and said you got a deal! Next day I drove in to Weatherford and Tony had EVERYTHING READY TO GO! In and out in 1.5 hrs. Would have been even less time except for a small cosmetic issue that the Shop took care of. Great dealership. No games, no gimmicks, no problems. Call Tony Ballard. ",5.0

9,"April 24, 2019","  I recently had to replace my KIA optima with another used vehicle, do to it being totaled in a accented. So i did my research online and found myself wanting a little larger vehicle than what my KIA was. Southwest Nissan in Weatherford, TX, web site made it very easy to see the inventory and prices of the dealership.  When i arrived at the dealership, i remembered seeing a couple of sales person waiting in the parking lot and thinking to myself how they could be compared to vultures circling their prey. Little did i know how much i would enjoy being proven wrong.  The gentleman greeted me and with a firm handshake and introduced himself as Mr. Tyler Weidler.  
   I informed Tyler that i was interested in a 2016 Nissan frontier, he promptly informed me, with a great deal of joy, that they had 2 and encouraged me to have a look and test drive them both. It was during this time he explained to why he was so happy about the Frontier with a story about a family member that may have been lost if it were not do to the vehicle exceptional safety performance. Now I know this could be a sales tactic but Tyler proved himself to be down to earth and honest with his responses to my questions, answering me with his knowledge or promising to find out and following though on it, all while sharing his jokes and stories. 
   After the test drive i found myself desiring of the trucks, but just to be through i wanted to think it over and get a second or third opinion of someone i trusted about the vehicle. So i informed Tyler that i would like take some time and come back to the dealership after lunch. He immediately  countered with "" why don't you take the truck with you to lunch?"" Seeing the opportunity i had to actually take the truck to the people i trusted i took him up on the offer. And with in a hour or two, i had multiple people confirming many things, if not all what Tyler had informed about the truck. 
 The Price was a great deal for the truck, but more importantly this dealership does pride itself with honesty, always questionable for a business to claim but the way i was treated and the fact that Tyler is still willing to answer any annoying question i might have about my new truck. Shows me that Southwest Nissan in Weatherford are indeed trying to live up to doing an honest business by putting the costumer first.
PS           I LOVE My Nissan Frontier",4.4
10,"April 23, 2019","After 10 years in my Kia Spectra 5, it was incredibly hard to move on to another vehicle. I spent countless hours on the road visiting friends in college, and cruising in that thing during some of the most trying times of my life. I loved that it was small but large, gas mileage was good, and it was easy to drive. 

After 6 months and 2 road trips in the Rogue I can confidently say that I am happy with my decision to upgrade and loving life in the Rogue! It has everything I loved about my previous car AND some. 

Bryan and staff were wonderful to work with & so kind throughout the process. Mahalo Southwest Nissan! ",5.0

15,"November 21, 2018","Tuesday November 13, 2018 I reached out to Southwest Nissan responding to an inyernet add for a used Toyota Tundra. Tyler called me back within an hour to let me know the truck was still available. Once at the dealership Tyler was waiting outside for me, ready to take the truck for a test drive. Tyler listened to everything I told him that I wanted in my next vehicle. The deal was probably the easiest transaction I have ever had while buying a vehicle (I have purchased several over the last twenty years). I love my new truck and I will definitely look at Southwest Nissan and ask for Tyler when we’re ready to replace my wife’s car in a couple of years. I also want to thank Tyler’s entire support team for keeping the process easy and smooth as we finalized the paperwork for my trade in and the new truck. 

Sincerely,

33,"August 23, 2018","Part of what makes a great dealership is receiving the full spectrum of service from the minute you call to talk with someone to the time you drive off the lot with your new car.  I did not receive that from Southwest Nissan.  I will admit that the sales process was going very well early on...I called on a Monday morning shortly after 8 AM, someone answered and confirmed the car I was interested in was still on the lot.  They texted pictures of the car to me to confirm it was there.  I texted back letting them know I was about 30 minutes out and on my way.  They had the car waiting for me at the front when I got there.  The sales person I could tell was new and inexperienced, and being a seasoned sales person myself, I was fine with letting her go through her sales process...even though I was already very knowledgeable about the car and new a lot about the features.  Test drive went great and loved the car.  Next step was getting my trade-in appraised.  This process took longer than I had experienced elsewhere...they had to drive my trade-in across the street to their Pre-owned lot and let their pre-owned manager assess the car.  Next step was to discuss terms and close deal...got that done fairly easily...next step was to discuss financing with finance person.  This is where the ball got dropped...my sales person said she would get the car cleaned out and detailed while I was getting paperwork done.  The car I bought was a dealer demo...so the sales manager had been driving it and it was slightly dirty on the inside and outside and the salesperson said she would get it ""detailed"".  I had already pointed out to her during the test drive where the car was dirty on the inside and outside.  After getting done with the financing paperwork, I went to go check on the car since they said it was ready for me.  I looked at it and they had not touched it!!  No detailing, no cleaning the inside...nothing.  I was very upset.  I demanded that they get the car cleaned out and detailed, since I just bought a NEW car, and I wanted to take it home to my wife in that condition...it was my wife's car.  The sales person made excuses that the detail team is hard to work with and get them to do anything....really!!  I was hoping to leave the dealership at 2 PM...2 hours later after 4 PM they finally had the car ready for me.  The sales manager and general manager both apologized to me for the delay.  Southwest Nissan...please take this feedback as a learning experience...you are not done providing excellent customer service until I drive off the lot...not after I sign the dotted line.",3.2

There was never any pressure to buy a particular vehicle and Bryan seemed to genuinely care about me getting the right vehicle for me.   The most impressive thing was that he didn't have an answer for every question. He was looking up answers to my questions during the test drive.   That is so much better than getting bad information.  Go see Bryan. ,5.0
46,"April 11, 2018","     I met with Aaron in pre-owned who was a great listener, no pushy sales thread in him, nor his dept. manager Dustin Rodgers. Both worked together to help get me the best deal and financing option for me.
     This was the second time to purchase from this dealership and again, as before, it was a wonderful, no frills experience to deal with them. I Had first purchased in 2007 and they helped me finance then as well. My credit wasn’t great then, but I did pay off the loan as scheduled and within the time period. They gave me a hi-five for that and worked it out through their financial dept. to again structure a loan that would work for me. Even though my credit had improved over time; my debt to income was not where other banks need it to be. They helped make it happen and it was better then I expected. 
      Just after purchase and before delivery to my home (40 mi. away) to take possession, they agreed to meet me at my Midas store service tech to do a look over and under the car for my own piece of mind. The car, (as I was confident) had no issues all the way around.  After 2  days of taking possession, and unbeknown to either parties,  we noticed the rear window tint caused a distortion at night that was a serious visibility issue. It was obviously a aftermarket application.
      I contacted Aaron and with no hesitation, they offered to remove the tint as a courtesy. This was completely fair in my books and there was no delay in getting into service the next day.
     This is truly, and hands down, a customer friendly dealership to work with. 

     Start here before you go elsewhere.! !

48,"March 12, 2018","I have to thank all the wonderful men that helped me get into a nice vehicle.  Bryan Farmer, Ryan Russel and Dustin Rodgers.  These three men worked very hard to find the right vehicle from my want list.  Not only did they meet my needs but went above and beyond in making sure I got what I wanted and at a price I was comfortable with as well.  They took the time to show many several vehicles and I am happy I drove away in my Nissan Rogue.  It was not the color I wanted but, had everything else I wanted and needed.  Thank you all for working so hard to please your customers and being patient with me.  I will be back for another vehicle when I am ready for one.  I just hope that you guys are still around at that time.  Your a great sales team.

He explained the different trim options to make sure we got what we needed but not pay for ones we didn't.  He was easy to talk to and very low pressure. He showed us all of the exterior, interior, seat options on the lot.  Southwest Nissan has a great variety of inventory so we could get the combination we wanted.

They remember who you are and treat you like family. Last Saturday, my husband and I had gone in and spent all afternoon and evening there. We ended up making a decision on a vehicle and leaving with a new car that night. Over the weekend, I realized it felt too crammed with my two kids in the back seat and realized I had made a mistake. I called and talked to the General Manager, Greg, who was so kind and told me to come back in. He assured me, I would leave with a smile on my face. He went out of his way to make sure that I got exactly what I wanted and helped do what was best for my family. Not only did I get the best service, but I know that they gave me the best price too. I was so thankful he let me come back, I could not be happier with my experiences the past 3 years with southwest Nissan. My husband and I will continue to get our cars from there, no doubt!! 
Thank you for all you do,

Note, they brought me the vehicle and I did not even go to the dealership, besides car shopping giving me anxiety driving on highways or longer distances makes me a tad nervous so they took that out of the equation by delivering the vehicle. Thank you Autumn.

I had been in the market for a new vehicle for over a year, but couldn't find what I wanted at a good price. I finally found a 2017 Nissan Maxima for sale on Southwest Nissan of Weatherford's website and immediately contacted Curtis Shackleford for more details about it.

During the process of buying my new car, Curtis did a great job of making the transaction as quick and easy as possible. Thank you Curtis!",5.0
58,"October 21, 2017","After having an accident in my previous vehicle, I found a truck I was interested in on the Southwest Nissan website. I received an email from Curtis Shackelford within minutes of indicating that I was intereste in it. Unfortunately, I had not received the settlement information from my insurance company, so I wasn’t quite ready to purchase. Curtis listened, and then kept in touch over the next week. I would receive a text or email from him every other day or so, letting me know the truck was still available. Never once did I feel like he was being aggressive. Once I new my previous vehicle was not repairable, I scheduled an appointment to see the truck. Curtis actually offered to meet me to see it. Since I don’t live close, I passed on that offer and went to Southwest to take a look at the truck. I was impressed with the dealership once I arrived. Curtis had the truck freshly polished and pulled up right at the front for me to see. After a quick drive, I knew I wanted to but it. It was closing time for them, and they offered to stay late, but I asked for the night to make a final decision. The sales manager, Harlan Ricks shook my hand and told me he would hold it until I was ready. I came back the next afternoon and completed the purchase. Again it was late into the evening, and the rental car place was closed for the night. The dealership let me leave the rental on their lot overnight, and I went home to show my family our new truck. The next day, Curtis returned the rental car for me. That proved to me that Southwest Auto Group has a genuine customer service focus. The entire purchasing process was comfortable. Thank You Curtis.

I have bought Infinitis, Porsches, Mazdas, Fords, etc.  

If you want an honest, straightforward, courteous, and dedicated person that has the empathy to understand what you are feeling as the car buyer, then I highly recommend Jason as the person to go to as soon as you set foot in that door.  Take my word for it, he will deliver on his commitments.  In fact, he delivered my truck 40 miles from the dealership way out in the Palo Pinto County countryside without any hesitation.  Go for it.

She was very honest, and a pleasure to deal with. I had been looking for a vehicle for about 2 weeks and had a couple of dealerships that were not as honest and reliable as Savannah. 
So it was very refreshing to find someone that was helpful and I felt like I could trust. 
She even showed us around the dealership and introduced us to employees and showed us the shop floor where the work on the vehicles and service them. 
What a clean Establishment!

Instead of taking care of their mistake, they told me I needed to work directly with Nissan Motor Acceptance Corporation to get their mistake fixed. Thus, I have been going back and forth between NMAC and the dealer for the past 18 months and still can't get my car title.

They made sure that I was taken care of, but not in getting me water or popcorn, which is nice, but making sure that my needs and wants were met.  They not only were competitive but ALWAYS exceeded beyond my expectations.  The ENTIRE staff was terrific from sales, Dillon Young, the sales manager Pedro Alvarez, Finance Justin Rogers & Luciano Gamillo to the GM Chad Shelton who chased me down in the parking lot to introduce himself and say thank you.  

They needed to locate my vehicle, which only took about a day,  and needed to add some accessories such as different rims and window tint, which meant I needed to come up several times, and every time I was their everyone made it an effort to come by and say hello.  I don't mean one of those fake hello's, but a sit down next to you and have a conversation about whatever.  I mention this because I am also in sales and meet those type of people everyday and could see right through them, but not these guys, it was sincere.  It was that good that my wife and I ended up purchasing a second vehicle from them a couple of weeks later.

When looking for your next vehicle make sure you visit these guys, you won't regret it.

105,"July 23, 2016","(EDIT 8/01/2016): Unfortunately I'm having to amend my original rating. While the sales experience was excellent, the followup was less than acceptable. Our vehicle was missing the key lock for the wheels and Collin McDonald said he would get a replacement and call on Monday. The day came and went without a response, fast forward two emails and one phone message without a response. I contacted the Used Car Manager today to voice my concerns of no response. In short, the item was not in stock and never ordered and I need to go by the service department to have it ordered. No explanation why the follow up was never made and in fact Collin was in earshot of the Manager because he was asking him questions based on my questions. I've changed my 5 star rating to a 3 star (neutral), pretty disappointed with the after sale communication.


(Original Review on 7/23/2016):
I appreciate the fact that my time was respected when I mentioned that I wanted to agree on a reasonable price without the customary back and forth. This was seen in the sales, appraisal  and finance portions of our purchase.

Although I feel well versed in the aspects of purchasing a car, each step was succinctly explained and our options clearly conveyed. Two hours from the test drive to completing all the paperwork, probably not in record time but just enough for my wife and I to feel comfortable with our salesman, Collin McDonald and the finance manger, Jason Toney.

Outstanding sales and delivery of our new-to-us car! I seldom write reviews but feel that these gentleman deserve the recognition of a no-pressure or gimmick transaction that was much appreciated; their ability and professionalism reflect highly not only upon themselves but to Mr. Gilchrist's dealership.",3.5

110,"June 13, 2016","Sadly, I had to update my review due to some issues with the car;

Within the first couple of weeks of ownership, we discovered and repaired the following problems;

1. Broken fog lights. This required complete removal of the front bumper to replace both fog light units.

2. Broken sway bar end-link.

3. Warped brake rotors. 

All three of these items should have been caught by the SouthWest technicians before putting the car up for sale. These items would have not been a deal breaker on the car, but due to them, I'd say we overpaid by $500-$1k. 

Thankfully, I was able to do the repairs myself. I reputable dealer would have charged upwards of $1,500 for the work (an Acura dealer would have been closer to $2k)!

Again, these should have been simple issues for an experienced technician to identify and correct. 

I'd precede with caution when it come's to SouthWest's pre-owned cars!!!


Original Review:

My girlfriend was in the market for a very specific used car. There aren't many in our area (Midland/Odessa), so we cast a wide net in our search (and cars are overpriced here anyway). 

Southwest Nissan had one that looked like a possibility. Before making such a long trip, I wanted to feel confident the car was as clean as advertised. I asked for some undercarriage pictures, and Curtis was so far as to put it on a lift to get good pictures. 

When we arrived, we found the car to be just as clean (if not cleaner) than we had expected.

Curtis was genuinely nice and pleasant to deal with. We agreed on what we felt was a very good price (compared to comps in the DFW area). 

We never felt any pushiness or pressure from anybody.   

I wouldn't hesitate to purchase from Southwest again!  ",4.0
111,"March 26, 2016","My wife Terri and I have purchased our last five Nissan's from Southwest Nissan in Weatherford Tx. The folks at this dealership are the best folks you will ever deal with. Our #1 salesman Tom Engel is the best salesman you will ever deal with, I promise you Tom will always go to bat for you.  
 The past few weeks my wife and I have been searching Southwest internet for a new Nissan. We were shopping for a vehicle with features such as power windows, power seat, power door locks, cruise ,tilt  ac, automatic and with a monthly payment we could afford. My wife and I noticed on Southwest Nissan's website two Nissan Altima's specials. We finally narrowed it down to one and  I sent Tom an email on the Altima. I received a response quickly from Tom.by phone. I told Tom what we had to trade and how much was owed and where we needed to be in payments. Tom said he needed to see our car but thought he could make it work or get real close. We set up an appointment on Saturday to meet. ""Well"" Tom went to bat for us again and we got the deal we needed to meet our budget.. Tom went to finance manager Justin, got him involved and both these guys together worked us out a great deal. I would also like folks to know you will never find a better service department than Southwest Nissan. The folks in that shop are courteous professional and know Nissan's. When you purchase a vehicle from Southwest Nissan you get the Nissan promise, that's free oil changes and tire rotation for two years free. Tom and all the folks at Southwest Nissan are truly out to help the customers needs. Thanks you Tom and all the folks at Southwest Nissan. Mike & Terri

112,"February 13, 2016","I've bought a number of cars in the past few years, and, while all the experiences have been good, working with Tom on my new 2016 Nissan Maxima was a real pleasure. Like most folks, I did some research online before I visited Southwest Nissan. I had a good general idea of what I was looking for, but of course had some questions. Tom listened to what I described I wanted and answered all my questions - without having to go to a tablet or computer. He just knows the Nissan line, what the various trim levels offer, and what the trade-offs are. We looked at two vehicles and Tom pointed out the differences as we drove. There was no pressure to select one or the other, just ""This one has feature xx, and that one has feature yy."" More like riding with a friend who knows cars than a salesman.

Tom does sales the old fashioned way - always courteous, respectful, and listening to what you want, no pressure, no hassle, no ""up selling"". He is there to assist you with what you're looking for. Tell him what you're thoughts are, and he will help you select the model and trim level that will fit your requirements. 

Too often salespeople, any salespeople, are more interested in what they want to sell instead of what you want to buy. This isn't unreasonable, they are looking for the biggest commission. That isn't always in your best interest, and you may wind up with more than you need or really want. With Tom, you believe that he has a genuine interest in your satisfaction first and foremost. 

If  you enjoy a low key, knowledgeable salesperson who will ensure you find what you want, then Tom Engel is the man to talk to.

113,"January 22, 2016","New years day of 2016 took a leap of faith and i drove from Kansas to purchase this vehicle. I am by no means a fan of dealing with car dealerships, but this one proved my reluctance wrong for the first time in my 41 year life. This all started over the phone a few weeks prior to intense negotiation. I requested detailed pics sent to me of this car on a lift so i may inspect the under carriage visually. Within an hour those pics hit my phone. I was NEVER haggled by this dealership into pushing for me to purchase, they respected my mechanical knowledge and background upon concerns i had with this vehicle. NOTHING was hidden, and NOTHING was baiting me into my further interest in it besides the car itself. I dealt predominately with the sales manager ""Curtis Mc'donald"" who absolutely SHINED thru this entire purchase, from start over the phone 500 miles away, until I was back home with the car.  Curtis catered to every single request of mine with ZERO hesitation or reluctance, and was all done with extreme courtesy and respect. The car was sold to me ""as is"" and once it left their lot, anything that went wrong was my responsibility and i signed to that, however, initially when i arrived to test drive i noticed the trans slipping a bit, then upon arriving back home to kansas the alternator showed signs of failure, to which i replaced immediately out of my own pocket. After doing so the bill hit right at $300. I told Curtis what had happened and a full refund for the parts were refunded to me by him. I by no means was sold a lemon and knew it instantly upon driving the car back to ks.  This vehicle had high mileage upon my purchase to which did not worry me after dealing with this wonderful staff, mainly Curtis Mcdonald. He shined from start to finish with this purchase and has gone above and beyond to make me happy and comfortable with this purchase. Curtis also agreed to have the trans fluid flushed at my local nissan dealership at their own cost. OUT....FRICKIN....STANDING experience with this gentleman and this dealership. 5 stars all the way across the board, if i could give 10 i would. I love this car, and the wonderful experience i went thru to get it, i will never deal with anyone else besides this dealership and Curtis Mcdonald in the future, the 1000 mile round trip was plenty worth it. HIGHLY recommend this business to anyone and everyone in the market to purchase a new or used vehicle. OUTSTANDING job Curtis, ill definately be back. :)))))))))",5.0

121,"March 22, 2014","Outstanding car-buying experience!  Brought my wife here to test drive a 2014 Altima SL and was not ready for the high quality service we encountered.  Stephen greeted us promptly and got to know us before he even began to discuss vehicles.  He did a great job answering detailed questions that my wife and I had, and brought around the exact Nissan (color and options) we were looking to buy.  While my wife test drove the Altima, I fired an array of questions at him and he handled every single one professionally with an accurate answer.  There was one question I asked regarding an engine detail that he didn't know off the top of his head:  he was honest with me and stated that he didn't know the answer, stated he would follow-up with me, and then got the answer for me as soon as we returned to the dealership.  Exceptional attention-to-detail and follow-through from him.  We decided on the vehicle and moved forward with the buying process.

The transition from the sales to the finance department was the best I've ever experienced.  Generally, this transition goes from friendly and helpful (SALES) to pure business discussion (FINANCE).  Not at Southwest Nissan.  Justin, the finance manager, greeted us and again got to know us before we even began to discuss numbers.  He did a great job making a connection with us and answering our questions honestly and promptly.  Again I asked a variety of detailed questions.  Justin had detailed answers and my confidence level continued to increase.  The buying process was very professional and organized.  We never felt like we were waiting on the dealership.  The staff members were always ready for us.

After purchasing the vehicle, we were introduced to Chad (manager).  He was very professional and delivered a sincere thank-you to us for our business.  As a car, the Altima had the edge against the other sedans that we test drove.  But as a dealership, Southwest Nissan is leaps and bounds ahead of other dealerships.  Inventory, service, professionalism, integrity, and organization are truly exceptional.

Jordan Reddish is one of the nicest young men you will ever meet
Very low pressure, honest and sincere 
He would love to sell you a car but building a relationship and your trust means more to him than anything
Jordan would be an asset to any company! Southwest your lucky to have him
We recently traded in a vehicle that was less than a year old. I told my wife that there was less than a 10% chance that we could do anything
Southwest Nissan made it happen
I have to give Southwest Nissan's finance department just as much credit, they worked extremely hard to make this purchase work
Southwest service department has also been top notch. They are a pleasure to work with
We will buy at Southwest again!

He set up a time for me to come in and test drive that day.  I was very impressed with his level of attention to my needs without being pushy!  Once I arrived at the dealership I was greeted warmly and taken straight back  to Justin.  He had the car ready to go!!  He  explained the car's features and differences between models. He also told me about Southwest's free oil changes & tire rotation for two years...which help secure my decision to go with Southwest.    I made my choice and we had the car financed and out the door within an hour!!  Awesome.

Get to Weatherford as fast as you can...Justin M is awesome and is there to make you a great deal on a car.  Justin is a mover and a shaker.  He is attentive, listens to what you want, very personable and if you can't afford that high end car; he will find you one that is just as classy within your budget.  His customer service skills are outstanding.  

We have never been disappointed in Southwest Nissan and are now on our 3rd Nissan Altima lease car.  I can say I wasted time at some local Nissan dealerships in the past and trying to save you some precious time; nobody will out sell SW Nissan!  That is why I'm telling you get yourself to Weatherford, TX and ask for Justin M.  There are two Justin's both are fabulous; but, you want Justin M. in sales.

I got a good honest deal on a fantastic vehicle in under 2 hours including 2 separate test drives and a trade in.  Car buying was a pleasure here.  Fantastic Experience.  I live over an hour away and have been checking their site for a car for me.  They are my preference of dealer out of the 100 or so in the Metroplex. :),5.0
130,"October 24, 2013","The moment I pulled up into their lot (in a 20 yr old pickup I was borrowing because my vehicle was in the shop, ha ha) I was greeted by Justin Merghart. I was looking for a mid-sized SUV and was still trying to determine what I wanted. I was interested in a Nissan Murano on their lot and we took a test drive. He was exceptionally patient and professional while allowing me to look at several vehicles on their lot, SW Ford, SW Ford Preowned, and SW Mitsubishi lots. I didn't buy that day as I was still unsure what I wanted and wanted to see all of the SUV's available from different auto makers before pinning down my purchase. I ended up falling in love with a different vehicle from another dealership, but I definitely appreciated his patience and willingness to assist me in making a decision. I definitely would have purchased from him if they happened to have the specific vehicle I ended up falling in love with.

Thank you for all of your time and hard work Justin! You are definitely an asset to Southwest Nissan and will refer people your way if given the opportunity.

Donovan Morrison and Tanner White are two superior servicemen who always handle my service calls - they keep me informed throughout the servicing of my car, letting me know if there is anything that needs to be fixed.  Yesterday, October 23, Donovan noticed that my inspection sticker was about to expire, and offered to inspect the car while it was there.  I appreciated his noticing this detail - he saved me an extra trip.

Although the cars we drove that day did not meet our expectations, Brian said he would contact us when one came in to the dealership which he thought we would like. A few days later, Brian called and said a 2011 Altima came in. We went to test drive it and it was exactly what we were looking for.

136,"August 03, 2013","While I am going to keep the review below because it did happen and I was frustrated, I must change my rating because of the response I received from the Service Director, Lisa Stoker. She tried several times to contact me. Unfortunately, I do not read my personal email very often and I had changed my cell phone number, but did not update the dealership with the new number. When she and I were finally able to speak, I was very pleased with the response from her. She did not make excuses for what happened, but she agreed with me that what happened wasn't right and that she would ensure it would not happen again to myself or another customer. She even went beyond that to learn what was happening with my airbag light continuing to come on. It appears that is a recall from Nissan, that the manufacturer did not contact me to advise. It is covered under the Nissan powertrain 60K warranty. I know I am close to that amount of miles and hope that I can make it into the dealership before I hit that limit.

I will reiterate that Southwest Nissan and specifically Lisa Stoker believs in Customer Service and will go the extra mile to ensure each customer is happy. I certainly appreciate it and I am confident that I will have a better experience the next time I go in for service.

I went to the dealership to have my oil changed and to have the passenger airbag light reset. Evidently, with my 2010 Nissan Cube if you press on the breaks to hard it disables the passenger airbag. This is the second time it's happened. The first time took 5 minutes to fix. I was told to come in early since it was a Saturday and they had limited mechanics working. I was the second person there. As I sit and watch people who came in after me and had their cars finished long before mine, I began to get upset. After an hour and a half, I asked what in the world was taking so long. Stephanie (Service Manger?) told me the technician was having a hard time getting the airbag reset. Seriously? It took someone else 5 minutes before. That and an oil change should not take nearly 2 hours, but by the time my car was ready that's almost how long it had been (an hour and 45 minutes to be exact). When I get in my car to leave I hear that my CD that I had been listening to driving in was on the 5th song, not the 1st as it was when I arrived at the dealership. In addition, I had to pull over and adjust my passenger side mirror as it was turned back against the car making it impossible to see, which in my opinion is a safety hazzard that the dealership left me and my car in. While the cost of the oil change with the purchase of a new filter was quite low and Stephanie was apologetic, but only after I complained, I would still not recommend anyone to go to this dealership for service. Moreover, I told Stephanie if she wants to offer good customer service, she needs to come tell a customer when there is a problem or a reason for an extreme delay instead of letting that person sit and stew and become more frustrated than was necessary. From now on, I will take my Nissan Cube to Frank Kent Cadillac/Honda for any service that is due. Not only is it closer to home, but the waiting area and personnel are far more reliable and nicer than what I experienced at Southwest Nissan. My car is three years old and I've been considering purchasing another one soon, possibly another Nissan; however, you can be sure I have no plans to go back to Southwest Nissan nor would I recommend this dealership to anyone.",4.4

Kale, Justin and the staff tried many different scenarios to make the loan work within my monthly payment range parameters and my current credit picture.
What happened next amazed me.  The could not make the loan work with the used car so they looked into a deal that would get me a brand new 2014 model and still fit in my monthly payment range.  It worked!

The used car sales man at that time Jay helped me with the purchase and financing and made that part easy. Although when the check engine light came on in my vehicle the very next day I was very disappointed as I live over 60 miles away from the dealership. I kept the car at this point as the sales person assured me that the car came with a 3000 mile/ 3 month warranty on engine and transmission. I then 10 days later took in my vehicle to the service shop and they acted like there was no such thing as a warranty and I had to get the used car sales person talk to the dealership after being their for 4 hrs and not even being offered another car as a courtesy they came back and stated that my car was ready. Then to much dismay the check engine light came on again half way home to say that I was angry was an understatement again, I had asked for a ""reliable car"". This went on two more times, and it took me posting on DealerRater.COM for the GM to actually do something for me. This dealership is only okay, in my book, because if you are in the business and want to keep lasting customers it is important to take care of the customer first time and worry about your rating second.  If this dealership had fixed my car the first time and then gave me a loaner and listened to my needs first I would have rated this dealership a perfect score. Make sure you are up front with your needs on this site and you can get what is honorable and needed, if you do not, you will not receive any type of customer service at all.

203,"November 13, 2012","I contacted Mr Norton to buy a Nissan Leaf.  We set an appointment for Monday afternoon.  Ten minutes before I got there I called Mr. Norton to inform him that I'd be there shortly.  He said he'd be waiting for me.  Well, as it turned out, I had to wait for him.  Nearly 15 minutes.  He did however apologize and let me know that this guy showed up who comes at least once a month to look at cars but never buys one.  I personally think he could have respectfully passed him off to another associate and indicate that he had an appointment.  

Regardless, Mr. Norton did have the Nissan Leaf charged up and ready to go, and so off we went.  He was nice enough, showed me the features of the car, answered my questions.  I asked if we could go to a bumpier road and he directed me to such a place.  The test drive was not rushed.  When we returned, I informed him that I'd like to talk numbers.  I showed him the deal that I printed from Nissan's website and informed him that I'd like that deal.  

Regarding my trade in, I informed him that I just purchased a new transmission and new tires for my car.  I had also upgraded brakes and intake system.  there was no body damage whatsoever.  Mr Norton offered me the lowest trade in value for a vehicle in poor condition, $500.  I told him that was unacceptable and began to leave.  The highest trade in value was $1000, so not that far off, but still I just sank $3000 into the car and I informed him of that before hand.  To offer me the poor condition trade in value when trying to sell me a car is nearly a sure way to lose the deal.  Well, regardless, I told them that if they could do the deal I found online, I'll take $1000 for the trade in.  

The numbers didn't quite match the deal I had found online so George allowed me to talk to the finance guy, Justin Rogers.  He was nice enough and patiently explained everything to my satisfaction.  I asked him how much it would cost to return the vehicle at the end of my lease and he said $0 if I'm not over my mileage and didn't have any excess damage.  I asked him if there was a fee to buy the car at the end of the lease.  He responded $170.  I took him at his word and shook his hand.  A few days later after reading all the details of my transaction, I found that the fee to purchase was increased to like $365 and the fee to turn in the lease was $300, a bit higher than originally agreed upon

Well, I ended up choosing a different color vehicle than the one I test drove.  As I drove home, it was apparent that the vehicle was out of alignment.  I called Mr. Norton the next day and emailed him twice.  I didn't get a response from him.  On Thursday as is their custom, he called to see how everything was and of course I confronted him about not calling me back.  He apologized and had his service adviser call me immediately.  His service adviser informed me that I would have to pay for the alignment and that it wasn't covered under warranty.  I was upset, but George was able to correct the issue and make it free.  My car was the first car there on Saturday morning at around 6:55am.  Assured that they'd get right on it, it ended taking 7 hours of my Saturday to get this alignment done and the car charged up sufficiently to get me home (why don't they have a quick charge system that is supposed to charge the car in 30 minutes?).  I wasn't offered a ride home.  I wasn't given a rental for the day.  

It's been a few weeks since then and I've realized that the navigation system isn't worth its weight.  It knows where you are in the world, but if there is a specific place you're looking for or an address, it won't find it.  Thinking I probably needed an update to the software, I opened up the navigation manual and found a phone number to order an update.  I called the number and they informed me that they can help with every Nissan except for the Leaf.  Imagine that.  The Leaf's instruction manual tells you to call this number.  When you do, they tell you that they cannot help you.  This is after getting hung up on once.  They told me to call the dealer I bought the car from.  So I did.  Southwest Nissan's service adviser told me that there is probably something wrong with the nav system or the SD card and to come in and have it checked.  I informed them that their dealership is nearly 40 miles away and they told me I could go to any dealership.  I rolled in to Grubbs Nissan.  With only 13 miles left to travel, I figured I'd just let it charge while they looked at it.  I walked into their service department and guess what?  Only one service adviser is qualified to check in a Leaf for service and... it was his day off.  I showed them I was quite upset.  The service director sent me home with a Nissan Rogue and said he'll have it checked out (that's what Southwest should have done with my alignment issue).  When I showed him it wasn't working properly, he agreed there was a problem.  After having his tech look at it later that evening, he called back and said that the system checks out and that they are not sure why it won't find places I'm looking for.  So today I get to pick up my car with a system that is still not working.  I will have to resort to using my cell phone for guidance.

Jeff Davis, the executive manager called me today in response to my negative report on Dealer Rater.  I also improved some of my ratings and removed some of my speculations from my initial review.  His call confirmed that the dealership is concerned about the customer experience and shows that he will personally do whatever it takes to make the customer happy.  Mr. Davis gave me his personal cell phone number and asked me to call him if there is something that He can do to make up for the issues I've had.  Mr. Davis assured me that he addressed my issues with his staff to assure that they won't happen again, and reassured me that the mistakes were unintentional.  He also informed me that he's escalated the issues to Nissan regarding the Nav. system and the wrong phone number in the manual.  

Though my experience has improved, and my rating has improved, the experience so far is not one I'd like to repeat.  I would however, be willing at this point to allow Mr. Davis the chance to give me a good experience with their dealership in the future.  ",3.8
204,"November 07, 2012","I was welcomed by my salesman outside as I pulled up and he indicated where to park my old truck.

It is hard to find this kind of good quality sales person among other dealerships. Courtesy Nissan in Richardson could really use a dose of this type of customer service and some honesty too. He and his manager Jeff Davis were nice, honest and professional. Kurt and Jeff are definitely the best ! After I picked up my new car,  Jeff Davis the Executive Manager at SouthWest Nissan did a excellent job on following up and making sure I was happy with everything. Every salesperson wants to make a sale, but Kurt and Jeff put more effort, time and passion into making the customer's car purchase experience a pleasant one.
Thank you Ed for steering me in the right direction. You were right, they did shoot me a straight deal.

234,"February 27, 2012","I am a firm believer that the reason why a ROLEX is a ROLEX,,, is because it is a ROLEX (which simply means that the precision of this distinguishable time-piece is the evidence of everything inside of it working smoothly and of excellence.
 
So here is my analogy of how the ROLEX concept applied to our experience with Jerry's Nissan:
 
Trish Smith was the High Quality casing (the out-layer which is what most people see when they look at a ROLEX) and that everyone involved within Jerry's Nissan is what makes the precision of the mechanism and outer layer match.

Was a newer car then we had envisioned ourselves affording and a better version then we even thought about, 3.5 L and a V-6. Had push button start and keyless entry.BB worked hard to get us a price we could afford and was not in the least bit pushy about trying to sell us the car. He was very helpful and very easy to work with. Not only did we get a great price but the car came with a 2 year oil change package and in Weatherford the sales tax is 2% less than in Fort Worth. What a nice bonus.Thank you so much for making the buying of a used car painless and enjoyable. It drives like a dream. Would be happy to make any car purchase from them in the furture. ",5.0
239,"January 07, 2012","Shopping for a new car can be a stressful experience. BB was very patient as we looked at both the Altima and Maxima. Initially we were undecided on our prefernce but after driving both we ultimately selected a Maxima. BB and his management worked with our schedule to select and  buy the Maxima. The car we wanted was not on the lot but we did drive home a Maxima the first day in order to meet a family commitment. Came back the next day and completed the paperwork. Due to the holiday weekend the car was not ready so we continued to drive the loaner the remainder of the weekend. Once the car came in, it was not what we originally requested but the dealership went out of their way to make it right. This dealership was a pleasure to work with and you can tell they are committed to customer service. I would recommend them to anyone who is interested in a Nissan product.",4.4

After we discussed I test drove the Aramada with BB and was very pleased. Not one person was ever pushy, which I respect. Ended up driving it home for the night to see if it was exactly what I wanted. 
Went back in on Tuesday and BB started all the paperwork and was very helpful. It was a very pleasant experience and done in a timely fashion. He took the time to show me how every little thing in the vehicle worked and never rushed me out the door. Am very thankful I chose to purchase my vehicle from him and the dealership.

241,"January 01, 2012","I was shopping for a new truck to replace my Ford and decided to try Nissan, as I already have a Rogue. I met with my salesman (Kerby) and he was quite friendly. My experience with Kerby when I bought my Rogue is what definetly brought me back to this dealership. Kerby is extremely helpful and doesn't push you into a sale of a vehicle you don't want simply to make a buck. Kerby managed the deal at my pace and did not rush me into anything. If I had questions, he answered them very effectivly and completely. He has a knack for evaluating people and their needs, listening to their desires and matching them to great vehicles in a friendly unassuming manner which puts you at ease. I never felt my stress level rise during the entire transaction...This my friends, is the mark of a GREAT salesman!!!  Total time in the dealership was 4.5 hours. 

I explained my ""pain"" level and what I was willing to accept and what I was interested in. We test drove a 2011 Titan Crew Cab.....WOW! What a truck. This Titan is definetly 100% quality. Comfortable, powerful, has nice lines, very smooth on the road, and good features like the anti-sway for trailering. I especially like the sliding rear window. The 5.6 liter engine has a feel of power and the rumble of the exhaust lets you know there is more than enough reserve power left for any task. Having all that power around you makes me feel like a kid again and looking for an excuse to use it.....While I do not make my living with a truck, I could with this one if needed. The towing capacity is over 9000 lbs....wow!
The seating position is great and allows you to see over the hood. All controls are easily accessable, stereo system is awesome. The rear seats fold up or down for storage or to accomodate a child seat. I have not seen this in any other truck with reat seating and definetly like the versitility of it. The leg room in front and back is unbelieveable. This is a ""Big Boy"" truck. I highly recommend the Titan if you are looking for a truck. It is a wolf in sheeps clothing.....If you make your way to Southwest Nissan, you need to look up Kerby for a great sales experience. Its been two days since my purchase and I still do not have buyers remorse....

I had such a great experience with Kerby as my salesman that I sent my son to him. He bought a new Altima the same day I bought my Titan. Kerby makes car buying easy. Consequently, We are now a Nisssan family. ",5.0

With all the options I wanted.  Only it was red.  I didn't want a red car.  So we took a Sentra off the lot for a test drive and loved it.  But no blue ones with all the features I wanted.  He immediately located a blue one at another dealership and arranged for it to be delivered the next day.

I met Ken Morrison while wondering around the yard shortly after getting there. By gosh, I liked the guy right off the bat. So he asked what I was interested in, I told him, and in very short order he showed me a Nissan Altama that I really liked. Well, after tyhat, it was pretty much paper work, Ken did introduce me to his son Donovan, but he was more, observing than helping. He is a very nice young guy also. Anyway, It was a pleasure doing business with Ken, and I left a very pleased guy; with a clean car with a full tank of gas too.

253,"September 04, 2011"," I happened to be driving by and I thought I would just stop in and see waht they
 had on a Nissian Altima. I did not think I was dressed proper as I had my overalls
 on and I am growing a grey beard to play Santa Claus this year. The reason I say
 this was that a few years back I was wearing a suit and went to a 5 starr dealer
 down in Weatherford and those folks there acted like they were doing me a favor
 to sell me a truck.
  When I entered Sowthwest Nissan the  lady at the desk introduced me to Bill
 Belarrat who asked me what I was looking for. Bill then told all that they had
 and if they did not have it they would find it for me. Bill showed me a used 
 2010 Nissan Altima 2.5S 4dr with low miles and looked brand new. He gave me a price
 and was true to his word and it was not like other dealerships where the salesman
 would say I have to go talk with my manager to confirm the price.
  Bill was upfront and truthful with me in everyway and you just don't find that
 at dealerships anymore. I am very pleased with the price I paid for the car and
 it looks brand new.

  My son was looking for a second car also so my wife and I told our son to go see
 Bill and just at least here what he has to say. My son also bought a second
 vehicle there also.

  I never thought I would say this , but if I ever need another vehicle I will 
 come here first.  I do not know what else to say but I am satisfied with my
 purchase from the price to the looks of the car.

283,"April 20, 2011","I used the USAA Car buying service to purchase this car.  However, I knew about the quality of this dealership and they lived up to it!  Ken never pressured us and was extremely knowledgeable about the vehicle choices.  I have had many demonstrations of the car's equipment after purchasing, and his was the best of all of them.  (I've had 6 cars)  This is definitely the dealership to purchase a car from!  Remember, no pressure!  You will probably do fine with anyone that works there, but you can't go wrong if you work with Ken.

p.s. They don't load up the cars with a lot of extras, you only have to get what you want.",4.8

285,"April 16, 2011","I went to Southwest Nissan because of this site's ratings for them, and because I hoped the Nissan Murano or Rogue seats would accommodate my wife's bad back problem.

About six weeks ago, I contacted them through their web site, and received immediate response from Ken Morrison, sales rep.   I explained to him about my wife's problem, and told him that we would need to try out any car over a weekend to be sure it worked for us, and he readily agreed.  

We set up an appointment, and Ken met us at the door.  He was exceptionally professional and courteous in every way.  He had cars ready for us to drive for the demonstration, equipped as we wanted ours to be.  He was totally knowledgeable in all aspects of the cars, and answered all our questions frankly.

My wife found that, unfortunately, the seats wouldn't work for her.   Ken was very supportive, said ""Well, much as I'd love to sell you a car, if it doesn't work for you, it really doesn't work for me, either; but thank you for driving all this way and for giving me the chance to show you our Nissan automobiles.""   There was ABSOLUTELY NO PRESSURE put on us to buy, and we were profoundly impressed with the Southwest Nissan approach, as shown by Ken Morrison.

If I was considering a Nissan, I wouldn't look anywhere else!

287,"April 10, 2011",I did actually find similar cars in other states for lower prices but the convenience of a local purchase and having a local service department outweighed the price factor.

288,"April 06, 2011",Used van purchase was a great experience.  Vehicle had an ding that they had not noticed.  The were honest about price point and went the extra mile to have it fixed.  Transaction went fast and smooth.  They also were very fair with the trade in.  I had planned on selling it myself and had some appraisals done.  They increased their offer above other appraisals to a fair price giving me the benefit of sales tax reduction and avoiding the hassle of selling the car.,5.0
289,"April 06, 2011","I was so appreciative of the atypical environment at Southwest Nissan. 

I started my search at Fort Worth Nissan but eventually had as much of the aggressive, manipulative, hard selling handling I could take.  I was relatively pleased with the salesman and didnt find him to be the problem but the experience was everything you hate about buying a new car. 

In frustration, we were going to drive to another dealership in the metroplex knowing the probability of having the same or similar experience.  On the way, I saw the vehicle I was considering with a Weatherford Dealership indicated.....Why hadnt I thought of Weatherford earlier...  We immediately turned around and drove to Weatherford.

What a relief...I have not purchased a new vehicle for MANY years(over a decade) because of my reluctance to go through the Dealership experience. I attempted it several times but always walked away.

I would tell anyone and have already, if you're looking for a vehicle....GO TO WEATHERFORD.  I would recommend Southwest Nissan to anyone based on my experience thus far.  

Bill Belarrat was my salesperson and he was GREAT to work with but more importantly to me, the sales manager wasnt like any of the piranha sales managers I have dealt with in the past   The purchase was relatively seamless, not painful and I'm pleased with my new ROGUE.  I am very satisfied and thankful I went to Southwest Nissan.",4.8
290,"April 02, 2011","Kurt, the finance man, and the general manager were all very nice, no pressure on purchasing a new vehicle. We got to test drive each car we liked. Our sales man started early on our paperwork so it wouldnt take as long. Everyone was fast about getting all paperwork done.",4.8

The staff was very knowledgable and appeared eager to answer all my questions. I have and will recommend the dealership to family and friends.,4.8
293,"March 29, 2011","My visit from start to drive out with vehicle was very satisifying/rewarding.  I am a female with very little knowlege about vehicles and Justin the gentleman that he is, met me at the door and I knew who he as his picture was in emails sent to my attention, he was very informative and answered all my questions and most of all he was very intuitive to my likes,dislikes and wants/wish list. He found the perfect car for me and helped in all areas to help me obtain my goal in purchasing my new red vehicle.  

The accouting/financial person was also very helpful in that he gave me some good credit tips too. 

The manager also came out and introduced himself - this is the main reason I drove out to Weatherford, I wanted a small town dealership - as they seem to be more personable.  The service was outstanding and I would most definitely send others your way.  ",4.8
294,"March 28, 2011","An exceptional experience and I purchased a car here, though I live in Fort Worth, because my previous experience with Fort Worth Nissan was so horrific.  I loved Tom Engle and the staff, and even took a friend out four days later who also purchased a car!",5.0
295,"March 28, 2011","I was casually looking around for a new car at the local Mitsubshi and Nissan dealers. When I pulled into the Nissan dealership, Bill Belarrat (""BB"") came out to help me immediately (the Mitsubshi dealership looked deserted and there was no activity even when I got out to look at their unfortunately minimal selection of cars.) 

I told Bill my price range, and he took me over the the Mitsubshi dealer where he thought I could get a better deal since I already owned one. We looked at a Mitsubshi, but they were unable to match my price requirement, which was admittedly very low, so I was ready to drop Bill off back at the Nissan dealer and leave. Bill suggested looking at a Nissan Versa and I liked it immediately. Bottom line: I bought it.

If it were not for ""BB"" and his attention to my desires and requirements, I would have left without a car. Bill listened to what I was looking for, knew his product inside and out (both Nissan and Mitsubshi), knew his inventory, and worked to get me the deal that I wanted. 

There was no pressure and everyone at the Nissan dealership was very friendly, checking to ensure that I had been helped while I waited for Bill to work the numbers. 

Buying with Bill as the salesman was like buying from a knowledgable friend, not someone who was just looking for a sale. 

I would unconditionally recommend Bill - ""BB"" - as the salesperson to seek out if you are looking for a new or used car.",5.0

299,"March 01, 2011","The most important thing to me when initially dealing with any business is the degree of friendliness. From the service person who was our first contact to the salesman, &amp; finance officer, every one of them was extremely friendly, &amp; treated us like we were important and they were very professional and efficient.  We actually came in to service our vehicle, and had been considering a used vehicle, and ended up purchasing a new one, mostly because the price and the value of service that went along with that purchase was awesome.  When we first arrived we were offered a ride to anywhere we wanted while we waited for our vehicle to be serviced, or there was a comfortable lounge.  We started looking at vehicles on the lot, and test drove some used ones, and fell in love with a new one.  They went over everything in the vehicle and made sure we were comfortable with everything. We were so impressed with everything we honestly will never buy another vehicle anywhere else.  I really could say more but my husband does say I talk too much so I will quit here.  I love my new vehicle.",5.0

He made sure I got what I wanted for the price I was willing to pay.I spent around 5-6 months researching my next car purchase, and looked at the Toyota Rav 4 (have already owned 2), the Honda CRV, and the Nissan Rogue. For those of you who dont want to do the research, trust me, the Nissan Rouge rates equally if not better than the others. When I told Jacob that I had been looking at other vehicles, he did not bad mouth or make any negative remarks about the other car makers or dealerships. He focused on the highlights of the Rogue, found out what my driving needs and desire in a car, and hooked me up to the best vehicle I have ever owned.  Thaks Jacob, your the best :)",4.8

My wife and I were very impressed by his sincerity and genuine desire to serve. Our process took three or four hours and we dealt with Bill, the Sales Manager and eventually,to my amazement when we could not finalize an agreement on price, with the General Manager of the Dealership who finally closed the sale. All of our dealings were conducted with knowledge,ability,great patience and I believe a sincere desire to serve our needs. Thai Truong (Jimmy), the finance manager, helped us obtain the 72 month, 100,000 mile Gold Preferred Warranty we desired, and assisted us when we decided to change the number of miles and months covered.

322,"September 22, 2010","In general, car dealerships have reputations lower than whale dung. Ken Morrison, Jimmy the finance dude and the staff of SouthWest Nissan changed that for us. Polite, honest, courteous and genuine are but a handful of heartfelt accolades we are more than happy to shower on these guys and gals. Not only did we get a great product (Frontier SE V6 Kingcab auto) at a great price (mind your own business), we were also treated to a most delightful experience. That just doesn't happen at car dealerships!

The entire industry should take lessons from Ken, Jimmy and their cohorts. Whether we're spending $2.50 or $25,000, we expect to get what we want, not what the dealer or manufacturer wants. Ken Morrison & Company did exactly what we asked, delivered everything as promised or better than promised and did so with no surprises or hassles. We simply can't say enough good things about this deal!

What a refreshing change to be treated like a human being at a car dealership! Thanks SouthWest Nissan for a job well done!

356,"June 28, 2010","This is the 2nd time we have purchased a car from Jerry's. It does not matter if you are in jeans and T-shirt or suite. You are treated the same no matter what. We were not followed around like we were going to be jumped on if we did not buy. Everate was polite, answered our questions and let chose at our pace not his. Several other dealers make you feel like hurry, buy and leave. Not Jerry's or Everate, because they want you to enjoy your buying experience. They want you to buy what you want so they let the car sell its selves. Several years ago we went to a well known Cadillac dealer in jeans and our everyday Saturday cloth. We could not even get the time of day. When we came dressed the same at Jerry’s we were treated with the respect of a prospective buyer. Even when we left to think about if we were going to buy, there was no pressure. This is our second new CTS and if we buy another GM product, it will be at Jerry’s and I hope Everate is still there.

As we were waiting on my car, sales representative, Zach Moore, showed us around the new 2010 Nissan Rogues. Seeing that my mother was anxious for a new car since she had her van for 12 years, Zach offered my mother to pick a car she liked and take it on a test drive.  She loved the car but still wasn't convinced. After she got to keep the car for a day or two and drive it around to really get the feel of the car, she soon fell in love with the car. We did not have the intention of buying a new car at all, well at least not so soon. With the help of Zachary Moore, my mother came back to the dealership after two days wanting to know how much everything would be and the payment options. Zachary Moore showed honesty in maintaining a positive relationship with his customer that built trust as a sales rep, understanding in financial needs and showed financial options, and demonstrated a good quality of what people should look for when purchasing a new car.

I had already done my research and knew exactly what I wanted.  I called Jerry's from another Nissan Dealership and asked to speak to someone in sales.  Zach got on the phone, I told him what I was looking for and about the bad experiences I had at the other dealerships and asked that he please go out on the lot and make sure the vehicle was exactly what I described and AVAILABLE to be driven and purchased.  He told me he would do just that and call me back.  And that is exactly what he did.  When we got to Jerry's the vehicle I asked for was there, pulled up and ready for us to test drive.  He took us around the vehicle and showed us all the ""bells and whistles"" then set us free to test drive it.  While my husband and I drove the vehicle, Zach took our trade and had it appraised.  When we got back to the dealership, Zach gave my husband and I the space to talk it over...he was never pushy or insistent.  He was patient and answered all our questions...AND if he did not know the answer he said he didn't and found the answer for us.  Once we sat down with him and started to negotiate the price of the vehicle Jeff came in.  He too answered all of our questions; he was patient, never pushy and very willing to earn our business.  Finance was a breeze as well as taking delivery of the vehicle.  Although it took some time...it always does...it was not stress filled.  It was almost too easy.  I had a few questions the next day, called Zach and he was ONCE AGAIN very willing to answer what he could and called me right back with the answers he could not give me on his own.

He sent me detailed info on the Rogue - with a decent price.  After further researching his offer, I decided to meet with Adam expecting a few hours of being pushed around by a sales rep, but what I got was a very knowledgeable person who listened to what I wanted... showed me his availability and in the end I actually up-sold myself - not once did I feel ""pushed"" to buy anything other than what I wanted.  

I came pre-approved for a car loan, but we decided to see what Nissan Financing could do for me  -  This too was an extremely easy process.. I received a much better offer from their financing department so I took it. ",4.8
393,"February 13, 2010","This was the second Nissan Armada I have purchased from Jerry's in Weatherford. I bought my first one 5 years ago because of the low price, responsiveness, and lack of a run around. deal was made over the phone and I simply drove up, paid for the truck, and drove off. I received a deal that gave me free tires for life!

That 2004 Armada was the best I vehicle I have ever had in my 38 years of driving! At he beginning a fog light fell off, and I had a defective piece of molding on the sun roof. At about 50,000 miles they recalled the brakes and installed a new brake system. Other than that, the only thing I replaced in 200,000 miles was a battery!!!

The free tires for life was a great deal! When I traded it in, everything worked!! Every switch, every knob, every function. This has been the best vehicle experience of my life.

Naturally I bought the same make and model from the same place. Trish in particular was responsive, friendly, and I especially like the lack of a typical run around in the sales process. I was given the same deal with free tires for life.

Trish, Jerry's and Nissan have a real winning package. I would strongly recommend this team to anyone looking for an excellent buying experience.

395,"February 11, 2010",Danny always goes completely out of his way to make sure that I have a good experience when I bring my '07 Maxima in for service.  My most recent visit was for warranty work.  Danny made sure that the inconvenience to me was minimal.  I appreciate the service crew for always going the extra mile!,4.8
396,"January 26, 2010","Trish was great. I had a special request in a Frontier and she did all she could to get me in the truck I wanted. I was told, in order to get the truck I wanted, they would have to trade a vehicle with another dealership. Within two days I was driving home in the exact truck that I wanted. Even though I live two counties away. This will be the first dealership that I look forward to returning to when my vehicle needs servicing. ",5.0
