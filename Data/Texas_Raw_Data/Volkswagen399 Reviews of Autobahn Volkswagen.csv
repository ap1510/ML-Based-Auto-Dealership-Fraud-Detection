3,"June 23, 2020","Issues presented to technician in MAR regarding low coolant. Low levels occurred in MAY and brought in JUN. Coolant issue that was brought up in MAR was not properly corrected or inspected. Part was installed and corrected in JUN only because I returned in JUN. 

Additionally, service manager, Richard Fincher did not provide loaner vehicle. Scheduled specifically for that date and time so I would not miss work. I ended up missing work because loaner was refused to me even if I have an current AD Military ID Card and out of state license was expired. My wife had to also ask her boss to excuse her from work to pick me up. Appointment was at 0800 and did not get picked up from wife until 1000. Receptionist and service manager, Richard Fincher made a huge scene in front of other guests.

I waited another week and called then  all of a sudden he said my car is ready. I went after work to pick up my car and  my panel was on the floor showing all my fuses. He told me first they changed, the radio, subwoofer and speakers. So then I asked if my radio was changed how come it's still bluetooth to my phone and the radio station are the same. Then he said they compared it to another vehicle like mine. The speakers sound the same. When I got home I noticed my organizer blocks were missing and my roller shade for the trunk. I emailed the advisor and no reply. I called on a Friday and he said they will order the organizer.

I put a lot of miles on my car and he will make sure he lets me know what is coming due over the next couple of visits and gives me an idea of pricing so I can prepare for it. I am a single mom and love that he can help prepare for the upcoming costs. I just ask for a ballpark as I know pricing changes. If he is told anything by the mechanics to keep an eye on he tells me and walks through what to be watching for so I don't end up with any major issues. He is great at communication. I have never had any surprises when I pick up my car as he will call and discuss anything above what we discussed at drop off. I schedule ahead of time and i am always able to get a loaner car which is much appreciated. It allows me to work and take kids to appointments and I wouldn't be able to take time off to service my car. The girls at the desk are always very personable and courteous.

My salesman went over all the features the car came with.  Especially the number one feature the Navigation System.  The salesman said I would have to wait a few more days because they had a few more preps to do on the car.  Which was okay with me, because I had to wait for my out-of-state Credit Union to send me the check to finance the car.  Everything was going well until I went to pick-up the car.
1st  My salesman didn‚Äôt come into work.  He had to be called in from home because he forgot.
2nd  We couldn‚Äôt go over any features of the car because dealership could not find the keys.

4th  Finally, when the salesman showed up with the keys.  We went over car and I noted a major discrepancy.  ‚ÄúNO Navigation System‚Äù.  The salesman said, what Navigation System.  He said this car did not have a Nav. System, I said that is one of the extra features we made the deal on and why I had to wait for delivery.
In a nutshell folks this dealership LOST a $27,000 deal.  Oh, I almost forgot, I had the financing lined up and CHECK-In-Hand.  So, I walked out with my money, no deal, no apology, and no follow-up communication.  Sad‚Ä¶  I really liked the car.
