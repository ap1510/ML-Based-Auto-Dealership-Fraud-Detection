1,"October 15, 2019","I purchased a used truck from this dealership Via internet. He ran my credit get me approved for financing I made arrangements to come out to Texas and pick it up only to be told that they sold it to somebody else from out under me. This was after I confirmed that morning that I would be out there. This to me is as low as you can go they care nothing about their customers only the sale. I would not trust a single thing Jack tells you the used car sales manager.

25,"April 28, 2017","I would like to say that I really enjoyed my experience at this location. Yalls salesperson Daniela was great, and she tried to find the right truck., She did check up on me after I left there, but she wasn't pushy, she just wanted me to help me get the right truck. Highly recommend her and the dealership to my friends. ",4.4

27,"April 17, 2017","I am pleased to recommend Fairway Ford to potential buyers and/or folks who need their vehicle serviced. Without going into much detail I will say that I *had* a vehicle which I ended up giving a No Confidence vote on.  Fairway Ford's Service Manager (J.B.) kept in constant contact with me and was very honest in the detailed report he would afford me.

JB also worked behind the scenes to make sure I was put onto a correct path when it was time to get a new vehicle.  Robby Huey was excellent as well as reassuring that he wanted to make 'things right' for me.  I trusted him and am glad I did.  Mr. Huey recommended a few vehicle for me/my husband based upon his knowledge, my needs and within my budget. 

Justin Walker was our sales rep.  Justin is extremely knowledgeable, nice and personable.  Justin and JC (Finance) took good care of me.  Justin even provided my husband and I with an inservice on the primary bells and whistles of our purchase.

Now a-days it's difficult at best to know who is honest and fair.  Though I'd have liked a little better price on my 2013 Ford Escape, I can say I believe all involved were genuine and trustworthy.  These traits often are waning in today's world.  From what I experienced, honesty and fairness are a way of life at Fairway Ford.
