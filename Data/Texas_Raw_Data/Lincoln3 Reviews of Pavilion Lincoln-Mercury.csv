0,"February 28, 2007","Recently, I purchased a 2007 Lincoln MKZ.  In all of my years of buying cars, I have never dealt with such a professional, non pressure, and knowledgable staff.  Everyone from my salesperson to the finance manager, did everything in their power to ensure my satisfaction.  I will definitely recommend this dealership, and will continue to buy Lincolns.  Also, I highly recommend the Lincoln MKZ!",5.0
1,"August 10, 2006","I did actually shop here for my new Milan, but when I asked for a specific trim level in the brochure I was told by the sales manager that he did not think that Mercury produced that trim level. I then purchased my Milan at another Mercury Dealer that had the trim level in the brochure. The A/C began to lose performance recently so I took my car to the Dealer that was close to my house, but I did not buy from them for obvious reasons. 

When I called to check on the status of my car the Service Advisor told me that he was convinced that my new Mercury had been in a front end collision, it now contained after market parts and did not want to warrant my A/C repair. The reason the Service Writer suspected this is because I had a paper courtesy floor mat in my car. I did recently get my car back from the body shop after being REAR ended. I was then asked to produce the body shop records in order to obtain warranty coverage for my A/C. The body shop kindly faxed the work details performed so the dealer would then cover my A/C under warranty. When I called to pick up my car they said it was ready, actually it wasn't ready when I arrived. They had not done the oil change I requested. I then waited an hour for my oil change. After all of the thrash surrounding this warranty repair there was not one apology no explanation at all. This is my third leased car and the my first from the FoMoCo. Due to this experience it will be my last. I thought Ford was trying to attract customers to turn its fortunes around. Dealers like this who have no customer service skills and are clearly uninformed about the products they sell will indeed make this a very tough task.

2,"May 06, 2006","I purchased a Blackwood from the dealership April 10, 2006. The unit is fine, but the customer service and overall experience was the worst   I have experienced in 60 years of buying cars. I think you will find, assuming you ever took CUSTOMER SERVICE 101, that giving terrible service is much more expensive than giving good service.
On April 7 & 8th I called the sales rep. and the sales manager and requested they have all the paper work completed and ready for my signature. Both of thme assured me would be done. I arrived at their office at 8:30 am. and they began shuffling papers and coming up with excuses that were very unique while I waited. Wonders of wonders we were on our way at 11 am. I was overcome by the joy of the efficiency I observed in your organization.  If you beleive that , you must beleive there are people living on the moon.
On April 30th I happened to glance at the temp. tag on the back of the Blackwood and noticed that it had big block numbers 4-31-2006.  May1 at 930 am I called your office and explained the problem and was advised that the person that could solve the problem was on the phone,but she would give them the message and thet would call right back. No call was received so I called on Tuesday and got to speak to a sales manager, I was assured he would get to the bottom of the problem and call me right back. No call was received so I call Wednesday and talked to a sales manager and requested he overnite a new temp tag. No problem he says, he was going right over to the business office and would put the title and the temp tag in an overnite envelope and mail it.
Nothing arrived on Thursday or Friday. So I called today, Saturday, and talked to a sales manager. He was advised of the problem but said the business office was closed but he would look into the situation first thing Monday.
Tomorrow I have set aside to write a few letters, ie. Ford Motor Co. with copies to the Lincoln-Mercury division,etc. I will provide you copies in the same time frame you have used with this customer.
