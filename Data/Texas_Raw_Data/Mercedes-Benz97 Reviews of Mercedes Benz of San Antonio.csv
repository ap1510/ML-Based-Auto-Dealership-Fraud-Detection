0,"November 03, 2019","Bought my Mercedes in Austin, first service was done (service a&B) at Austin, went to San Antonio Mercedes on Friday with an appointment and waited for 4.25 hours for an oil change and a tire replacement.. it would of been 10 x faster if I was just going to buy a new car. Got put on hold till they could wash everyone’s car in SA I think.Was looking at a new Mercedes for the wife and needless to say I’ll buy it in Austin...",1.0
1,"June 28, 2019","After numerous new owners took over Boerne Benz the service began to be pathetic. Started San Antonio Benz after they recently had new ownership change & started to have decent service but then Service advisor Jeff Sauceda stopped providing preliminary estimates of repairs only simply doing verbals over the phone which wasn’t good at all. Advised I needed preliminary estimates so I could at least double check repairs details along with checking my extended service warranty through Endurance as I had discovered the Benz reps previous verbal details were wrong on coverage as the door actuator that Benz rep said “wasn't covered” WAS actually “covered” when I verified Benz’s mistake myself through Endurance. Advised the new Service Director Daniel of the service advisor failing to provide normal written estimate details & the mistakes I had to get involved & confirmed along with Benz Dealers new owners now limiting service discounts at $200. Daniel simply passed my issues over to an assistant Ryan who called me & I again repeated my issues now for the third time. Ryan said he would inquire & said further discounts can always be adjusted leaving me the impression something would be followed up on but instead never heard back from anyone. After service as usual there were service surveys sent in which I filled out the same above details emphasizing the service managers lacking follow through or follow up. Sent a follow up email to Ryan & never heard back. Also sent a follow up email to Daniel who also never followed up. Happened to stop by the dealership helping my parents Benz in the shop & passed by Daniel & mentioned the lacking follow up in which he acted as if Ryan had handled everything which he hadn’t not returning my call or email. Needless to say it’s been months & nobody ever followed up from my initial concerns & the last survey I noted nobody followed up with me & yet still nobody cares at Benz to remedy any issues that a customer brings to their attention. Also just discovered while my parents Benz was still in for repairs that the deficient Service advisor had suddenly quit the dealership adding to the poor service experience I had already been going through. Now anyone should be able to conclude from my above experiences that the San Antonio Dealership is having some heavy staff turnover including the fact the newly hired service director Daniel is simply worthless when it comes to handling a terrible service experience considering the proper remedy would have been to allow a small amount of credit to the $18,000 dollars I just paid for their service in the last 2 recent visits this past quarter. Service Managers are not concerned about customer retention & literally ignore customers issues even though multiple surveys reported issues outstanding. Looks like San Antonio Benz is quickly trying to return to the once pathetic service they used to have with their past very bad reputation & it’s because of the current individuals who could simply care less. Congratulations new owners for destroying customers trust in wanting to depend on good repair & customer service. It would appear after new owner/operators take over these dealerships the customer service experience seems to steadily diminish. Bunch of pretenders trying to run a very expensive service shop. Would recommend for others to search elsewhere for repairs.

PS.
Since Benz San Antonio hired a new Service Director Daniel aprox 2 months ago it seems their interest on replies regarding any of these recent customer service reviews doesn’t seem to get any attention either kinda like the lack of attention the service manager exemplifies during a reported service issue while your cars in the SA dealership.",1.0

62,"August 21, 2017",I dropped my car last week after it stayed in the dealership for 3 days for AC filter issues and break squeeking. The AC issue was resolved (hopefully - completely since I had to go back for this issue too) but for the breaks - I still heard a faint squeaking the day after I picked up my car which has gotten worse since then. I like this dealership but lately I'm wondering why they couldn't hit bulls eye like they used to. Today I have to drop off my car AGAIN - I don't have the luxury of time to be doing this coz I have busy work to attend to. I don't have complaints on Ryan who assisted me but whoever is doing the diagnostic screening or the mechanics - should do a better job. Im sorry for negative remarks - just kinda frustrated. ,3.0

69,"June 13, 2017","Let me start by saying I rarely write online reviews for service providers, unless they are truly exceptional. After my latest service encounter with MB of SA, I felt compelled to tell my story as an example of how fantastic this dealership service center is.

Recently, my CLS550 suffered a complete transmission failure due to a leak that had formed in the transmission cooler that had allowed coolant to mix into the transmission fluid. While not common, the nature of this type of component failure is undetectable and is usually found after the transmission has been damaged beyond repair. I found myself staring at a $11k transmission replacement that was out of warranty (car has 70k miles). 

MB of SA immediately issued a courtesy vehicle to me while they petitioned with Mercedes Benz for a customer goodwill repair discount. I kept my fingers crossed that MB might have been willing to assist with the replacement, but didn't expect much, as they were under no obligation to do anything. Well, I was stunned with MB response to the petition... in a good way. MB agreed to pick up the entire cost of replacement of the transmission, radiator, and torque converter. Parts had to be shipped from Germany, and the overall time of replacement took just under a month. During this period, MB of SA kept me updated whenever something pertinent happened with my repair, and also let me keep the courtesy vehicle until they were able to return my car to me.

Both Mercedes Benz and MB of SA represent the highest level of customer care and brand quality. I cannot thank them enough and recommend both of them with highest confidence. This experience has made me a MB and MB of SA customer for life.",5.0
70,"June 05, 2017","I live in Louisiana and my nearest dealer is located in Beaumont Texas. Last week while on my way to San Antonio for a Ducks Unlimited National convention the check engine light came on between my home and my Beaumont dealer. A stop at the dealership in Beaumont detected a noc sensor problem. I could have had the problem fixed there but was running short of time {about 1 and one-half hour to fix]. The service representative, Kristy Lindsey, in Beaumont called Mercedes Benz of San Antonio and set up an appointment for me with the service department the next day, gave me the mechanics note on parts needed, checked to make sure the part was in stock and the phone number and instructions for Joshua Rice my contact person at MB San Antonio. The service from Joshua and MB SA was great. They not only fixed the diagnosed problem but a couple of other problems that were found. I was very busy with meetings and would have had a problem getting my ML 350 picked up. My car was graciously brought to my downtown hotel with a follow up phone call and text to let me know it had been dropped off.

80,"January 13, 2017","We purchased a 2 year old certified Mercedes GLK350 four our teenage driver. We wanted a super safe car which would last her through college. The airbag was included on the recall list and neither Mercedes Benz USA or MB of SA helped at all. MB of SA just tried to sell us a new car with a very poor trade value (because they cannot sell the car due to the faulty airbag). That was the extent of how they planned to address a potentially exploding airbag which could shoot shrapnel into the face of a 17 year old girl. Thankfully another dealership stood up, when they had no responsibility to do so, and resolved the situation. We have sworn off MB of SA due to their lack of action and suggest others do the same.

83,"May 26, 2014","I really don't like to buy a new car.  I don't like to hassle over price, trade-in, etc.  But this time it was actually pleasurable.  I used USAA's car buying service and I can also recommend that.  I walked into MB of SA, and met with Bobby Rios.  He's a very friendly and knowledgeable guy.  He showed me the cars they had on hand that fit my needs while he had the used car manager look at my trade-in.  They had a new car that I liked and so I asked them what it would take to buy it.  Of course I had done my homework on the value of my trade-in and I had a figure in mind.  I was pleased and surprised when Bobby brought me a deal which had been approved by the Sales Manager.  It was about $3,000 less than I expected to pay.

I signed the deal, did the required paperwork and I expected to hear ""Come back tomorrow"".   To my surprise, Bobby said my new car would be ready in about an hour.  While my new car was in Make Ready, Bobby did his best to show me how to run all the features on my new car.  True to his word, the new car pulled up at the appointed time.  I think I was in and out of the dealership in about two hours and that included a stop by their great customer lounge for coffee and danish.  I love the new car and I can absolutely recommend Bobby Rios and Mercedes Benz of San Antonio.",5.0

87,"September 29, 2012","We are very happy with our car and the overall experience of our purchase. Lisa did a great job and, in addition, patiently helped us set up all the bells and whistles on our Limited. The windshield had some damage so we opted to have it replaced. Lisa and Dino made certain that we were happy with the work.  We are. Thanks so much for your friendly service and expertise. You made everything easy.  ",5.0
88,"August 09, 2012","We had a great experience buying a new smart car.  Paul Spencer explained all the safety factors and the incredible ecological features of the car.  It took very little time to come to an excellent price, and we drove off with a great deal on a great commuter car.  We will definitely go back to them when it is time to replace our BMW.",5.0
89,"August 03, 2012","I am a repeat customer of MBofSA. Paul Spencer expertly handled the sales of both of my vehicles. Mr. Spencer impressed me with his genuine customer service minded attitude. My buying experiences were pleasurable, but more importantly, my questions and concerns after the purchases have been promptly and professionally addressed. MBofSA sales and service team goes above and beyond to assure customer satisfaction and that is why I am a repeat customer. ",5.0
90,"June 11, 2012",This is my second time to buy a car from MBoSA.  Paul Spencer has been my salesperson both times and what a joy.  Not only is he on top of his business acumen but remembers things about you personally that makes working together that more efficient and effective.   I literally spoke with him at 9am and by noon I had the deal that I wanted.   Oh and did I mention I was working with 3 other dealerships that couldn't come close to his price and I kept having to follow up with them which is ridiculous.  I would definitely advise anyone that wants a Mercedes to call Paul Spencer personally and buy a car from him.  ,5.0
91,"May 02, 2012","Over two months ago, I took my ML55 into for some service on the washer system and to have a pull handle on the rear trunk lift repaired.  They ""repaired"" the washer system (for the third time in the past year) but since then, the passenger side sprayer no longer sprays.  Also, at the time of pickup, I was told that the rear handle was just in and they needed to paint match it so it would be ready the next day.  It wasn't so it was going to be a few days later.  I called.  The piece had not arrived...such a miracle...I was told before it just needed paint matching.  A week passed.  Two.  I called.  No return call.  Another week.  I called.  No return call.  I called and started getting a little hot and was told Gary Sauders, the service tech, was out on leave.  They gave me Gary Lewis, the Service Manager.  He said he'd take care of it and have that piece delivered the next day (since there were parts available right here in Texas!) and he'd have it painted and call me and, by gosh, we'd get this fixed!  A day passed...two...three...I called back.  No return call.  I called back (it had been about 2 months by now...no call back.  Finally, I get hold of Gary Sauders who has now returned from leave and told him to send me the money for that part as in now, please.  No!  No!  You can't do anything, Gary, just send me the money please.  Over 200 bucks for a piece of plastic.  Gary assured me...the next day!  So, a few days later I get a VM asking me to verify my address.  After 10 years of having my ML55 serviced there, they were finally verifying my address.  I did so.  Another week passes...I call Gary Lewis.  He'll get right on it!   Another week passes.  This week, I've called four times.  No return call.  This is a Mercedes dealer, folks!  Unbelievable!  How can this be?  How can they retain a franchise with such a brand with this kind of service?  I guess it is retain an attorney and go that route.  ",1.0
92,"March 27, 2012","Gregory Pancake was the salesman who assisted us when we leased a 2012 Smart Fortwo. He was totally uninterested in explaining anything to us about both the car itself, and the leasing process. He could easily have upsold us to a better model but he was not into it. The books he presented me with when I picked up my car had place for all sorts of helpful information and a slot for his business card. Nothing was filled out, and there was not even his card. I was given no information about the service arrangements. To this day, three months since the lease, I know nothing about this aspect of my agreement.

Andrea in Financing was not as helpful as I hoped she'd be. I called her yesterday to discuss my options in returning the car under the Early Termination provision. She seemed clueless; even when I read to her directly from the contract she was confused and gave contradictory statements. She began by stating that I would have to come to her office in order for her to help me. I told her it could be done via phone call. I had to show her where on the contract to find the Early Termination clause. After that, she began giving contradictory statements regarding the specifics of the agreement. Finally, she gave me the phone number of the financing company. Her attitude the entire time was contemptuous and condescending- a 180 degree difference from the day I signed the paperwork.

I am completely dissatisfied with the quality of the service I have received at the Mercedes dealer in San Antonio. I wish I had never set foot on their property.",1.5
93,"May 18, 2009",I searched a long time to find the right used GL320 and this dealership was very helpful.  I live out of town and came in late in the afternoon to purchase.  It was exactly as promised and the staff and salesman were professional and very accomodating.  Dealer was fair on the sales price and trade.  They made this a very positive experience.  Geoffrey Barnes was the salesman.  Very knowledgeable.,4.8
94,"October 05, 2008","The salesman was polite on the surface but showed arrogence and lack of knowledge of the vehicle we inquired about.  

1. We would like to have a R-class with the 7 seat option and Panoramic roof. He searched MB inventory but apparently don't know how to search for the 7th seat option. Several of the vehicles he shows on the screen has no 7th seat but he insisted that the 7th seat comes standard on R-class even after I pointed out his mistake. 

2. He refused to print out specs for various R-class models for us to compare.  Don't know what is going on in his heaad. 

3. He quoted a higher price on a used 2008 model.  Later, when we asked for the price for a new 2008 model with the same spec, he revealed a much low price and refused to explain the price discrepancy. As the old saying goes, Never trust a salesman, especiall when it is a MB salesman. 

4. He even didn't bother to ask about our contact information.  The attitude is take it now or you don't need to come back.

5. We did the only honorable thing in this situation - buying from MB Boerne.  People there are much more appreciative of our business.  Btw, as I am working in Austin, I got chance to visit all four dealers in the region - San Antonio, Boerne, Austin, Georgetown.  SA MB is clearly the worst.  ",2.2
95,"April 26, 2008",My wife and myself had dealt with Mike Jones previously in the past and wanted a no-hassle situation again this time around and chose to go back to Mercedes-Benz of San Antonio.  The price was on par with the closest competing MB dealership and Mike did a wonderful job making us feel welcomed again with absolutely no pressure.  We had coffee while we briefly waited for our vehicle.   The most important part of the buying process was our monthly payments Mike managed to get for us.  They are exactly where we wanted them to be.  There was no up-sale pushing during our purchase and it felt exactly the way buying a luxury car should.  We also get our other Mercedes serviced there as well and recommend Brian for your vehicle's servicing.,5.0
96,"July 08, 2004","Absolutely the worst, most stuck up dealership I have ever been to. When looking for a new car, I visited the dealer and inquired about what my wife and I were looking for. Instead, we got a speech on what the salesperson thought we should get. When we discussed trading in our vehicle (a competing luxury vehicle), we were offere auction value for the car. When we asked why, the salesman said that there were visible defects on the car. Bear in mind, this car was 12k miles fewer miles than it should have had and not so much as a scratch anywhere. Adding insult to injury, they offered to finance us at a high interest rate and $10k less than we wanted.Bottom line: This dealership tried to take advantage of my wife and I.End result: We bought a car from their direct competitor the following day and came back in it and picked up our desposit for the Benz we had initially considered buying.",1.0
