0,"May 09, 2020","Wasted hours of time today on what was supposed to be an easy transaction. I worked all numbers last night with my trades, filled out the credit app and went in this morning. When I arrived the tires on the truck I was buying were original and worn out making a lot of road noise and vibrating. When I asked the salesman Steve Steven Montgomery he agreed to replace the tires, then when the buyers order came out it was priced $5000 more than the manager Raul agreed to last night. After they adjusted the price to what we had agreed upon (and was advertised for online) they retracted their agreement to replace the tires.

This is the third time I have tried to buy there with similar experiences. Also looked at a 2020 High Country w/7k miles that was priced over new at Cavender and they wouldnt budge. If you want a fair deal, skip this place.",1.4
1,"May 02, 2020","My wife and I met with Eric Smith when we arrived at the dealership.  We were not sure if we wanted to take advantage of the promotions being offered which was the reason we went to the dealership in the first place. Eric is very friendly and unassuming so we were very comfortable talking with him.Throughout the entire experience we were treated with respect. He showed us several options but never pushed us to make a decision. In addition, he continued to follow-up after our purchase to ensure we were completely satisfied.  We highly recommend him!
Also, Jimmy Guerra, Finance Director, definitely knows his business. He gives good advise and doesn't try to sell anything you don't want. ",5.0
2,"April 29, 2020","I will gladly drive to Castroville for service on my 2014 Silverado.  They were able to start working on my truck immediately.  When parts were delayed, Christina made sure to call me and give me transportation options. This dealership provides friendly service. Patience with people like me is always impressive. Thank You so much. I have found my new Chevy Service and Dealer",4.0

12,"May 26, 2019",Lee was a great sales associates. Was very helpful. Very knowledgeable and most importantly. A very trustworthy person and that’s the best thing that you can get from someone. ,5.0
13,"May 22, 2019","Salesman Eric Smith was absolutely fantastic. Very professional and extremely helpful with finding the right truck. I would recommend to everyone I know. I pass out his cards all the time. 

Finance person named Lorna, not so much, shook my hand and made me a deal. We signed paperwork and I drove home. A week later she calls with some story about GM going back on their word and tried to pressure me into signing a new contract of a lesser than stellar deal. Made multiple excuses to cover the fact that she made a mistake in the numbers and would not offer hardly any compensation for the terrible business practice. I would recommend keeping copies of anything and everything you get from this person. And get everything in writing. ",5.0
14,"May 20, 2019",I don’t normally give reviews but Lee and the staff at North Park Chevrolet in Castroville are amazing. Lee was very kind. He was very transparent and honest about everything.  This was hands down the best car buying experience we have ever had. We love our new 2019 Traverse ,5.0

18,"January 28, 2019",Went in for an oil change package and installation of front plate. Customer service was great. No word on the tire rotation that was supposed to be included in the package I purchased. I had to come back for the front plate install even though I made the appointment online four days prior. Not sure why the bracket wasn’t ordered at the time the appointment was noted in the system. The wait on my second return was longer than I expected and there were no snacks available even though it was only 9 AM. The people were friendly and courteous. Joe was extremely helpful and did apologize for the oversight and the wait.,4.6

21,"January 07, 2019",Great place to buy a vehicle. Mr. Andrew Zapata helped us find a great deal on a 2019 Traverse. North Park gave us a better trade in value than a popular Chevy dealer in San Antonio. Everyone at North Park is very nice and friendly. Great prices. I would definately recommend North Park Chevrolet. ,5.0

24,"October 23, 2018","Turned my 2018 Malibu in for warranty service work on the fuel indication system. Couldn't fill the gas tank all the way. The gas gauge never indicated above 3/4 full. The gauge both analog and digital kept varying back and forth between 1/2 and 3/4  full. Turned the car in at 0800 on the 9th of October, as scheduled and heard nothing until L called up the next afternoon to check on it  At that time  I had to wait until I got a call back and found out a replacement fuel indicating sensor had come in and Parts had not advised the Maintenance Adviser Ron who had been handling my problem  The car was ready, but the communications breakdown resulted in my having to check on the status of my car

25,"September 07, 2018","I love the new truck and Adolfo was helpful, but I was supposed to receive a $50 gift card for test driving (and purchasing)  and never did.  I asked about it for weeks, but eventually I stated to feel petty and frustrated.  I love my new Chevy though!",4.6
26,"July 26, 2018","Very slow on processing paperwork, will not call & follow up on issues with new purchase.  No service after the sale.  Conflicting stories on why paperwork has not been sent out.  Out of state purchase process was not explained up front.   30+ days without MCO & buyer's order after picking up the car.",1.5
27,"April 18, 2018","We found the truck that we wanted online.  Eric Smith was very helpful getting the details verified for us.  He then drove the vehicle from Castroville to the north side of San Antonio to help us coordinate a necessary modification.  Eric was friendly, honest, and pleasant to work with.  It's easy to tell that he's invested in his community.",4.6

33,"December 13, 2017",Great dealership. Everyone was friendly from the lady at the front desk to financing. Drove from San Antonio to visit this dealership. The guys are willing and helpful in every aspect of purchasing a vehicle. Now pressure sales. Get you what you want and nothing extra. I highly recommend NP Chevy. I will definitely be back to purchase from them again. ,5.0

36,"October 24, 2017","I am a out of town buyer. I have bought many vehicles via phone or internet over the years. NP Chevy had a Black Out Edition Silverado I was looking for and negotiated with me long distance. My sales person was Eric Smith, which had contacted me after I made my online inquiry. He worked the deal for a couple days and got me close enough on my trade and price, to make the sale. They even offered to bring the vehicle to me in Corpus Christi but held it for me a few more days, so I could come to the dealership in person. I can say not many dealerships will do what NP Chevy did!!!!",5.0
37,"September 29, 2017","I was looking into getting a used vehicle that I had seen online Sunday evening. Left my info to be contacted the next business day. I was contacted the next day by Lee Perales. Lee and Jimmy Guerra really went over and beyond to help me. To my surprise, I was approved for a new 2017 Chevy Cruze hatchback. I was always reluctant to go to a dealership because you tend to always hear the horror stories of someone’s bad experience. Well I am proof that you will not have a bad experience here. These guys will make it work for you and help you get into a vehicle and back on the road. I will always recommend Lee and North Park Chevrolet Castroville.",4.6
38,"September 02, 2017","Lies. The dealership sold me a defective truck and did everything they could to avoid remedying the issue until it was beyond buyback mileage. The service department also did a service on my air vents which affected the blower and now makes a loud noise when it blows. Told them about it. Didn't even get looked at. Looked at the service notes, not even in there.
The original salesman sold me a truck thst was a demo and assured me that it had all the same warranty as the one I wanted off the lot. Never owned, never sold, just was used for service customers. Well, according to GM, it's a used truck and prepared by the dealership. I was lied to. And GM denied any buyback because it supposedly is preowned. I was LIED TO by the salesman. I was told it is still considered brand new. Severely dissatisfied!",1.4
