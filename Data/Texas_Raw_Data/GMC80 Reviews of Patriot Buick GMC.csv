0,"June 06, 2020","***My Buick came back to me in worse condition than it came in, and the technicians was never able to find out how to fix my parking brake service light or anything at all!!!! How is this a BUICK dealership that doesn't know how to fix a BUICK CORRECTLY??? ITS A SHAME THIS BUSINESS REPRESENTS BUICK AT ALL! Yes I got a refund, because nobody was able to fix anything!!!! 

***A correct diagnostics to fully fix the customers vehicle from the beginning would of been ideal! Having the technicians ""play a guessing game for services"" with customers vehicles and finances is wrong and unacceptable! Also having the wrong parts or saying it General Motors sending faulty parts is something you'll as a business reach out to GM about. Its bad for business and most customers only see that your services department are not organized and you'll not doing a good job with diagnostics completely. 

***My BUICK VERANO seems like services and technicians just ""dissected it and returned it to me with no respect or integrity"" for your customer. I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT I AM DRIVING, its not the same vehicle I brought in, and I used credit card and waiting on my refund so I can possible find a legit place to get the correct diagnostics and my Buick fixed properly! How am I supposed to trust driving this car now, with my family and travel with the military? My credit card refund has not returned yet and hopefully it comes back to my bank asap, because I need to fix my Buick Verano. 

Mike Smith was the only one helpful this week assisting the refund process and updates with my BUICK VERANO. I appreciate the assistance from a Fixed Operation Director, but why doesn't your service advisors and technicians work on a more professional manner?? 

You'll really lost a customers trust and me being military and from Texas (San Antonio) I was hoping for you'll to earn my business, because Soldiers always end up back in Fort Hood, TX and need quality automotive services. It's just not gonna be Patriot Buick/GMC for me anymore! I pray you fix your services department and business.
God Bless!

12,"September 05, 2017","Andy was helpful and knowledgeable right from the start. He took us on our test drive and explained all the gadgets and features I was unfamiliar with. When we returned to the dealership they got us the most competitive price, lowest interest rate and outstanding trade in value. Hands down the easiest decision I have made in a long time. Andy was great; he walked me through my new truck step by step. My fiance bought his pick up from a different dealer (which he now regrets) and Andy offered to help set it up since his dealership failed to do so. If your looking for customer service and the best deal come to Patriot and see Andy! ",5.0
13,"June 03, 2017","We bought a new vehicle from them last month and are currently having body work done on our other vehicle there this month.  In both instances the Patriot reps have provided excellent customer service.  Ryan Anderson was our sales rep, and what I liked about him was his attitude towards sales.  We discussed the pros and cons of various vehicles and mapped out what would be a good choice for us and left it at that.  No pressure to buy-just heres what I can do for you and left it up to me.  I like that style of salesmanship, and after looking around town came back and bought from him.  With respect to the body work we are having done on our other vehicle there, both Mike Smith and Liza Alejos have been great about managing our repair.  They communicate with us on the details and the progress of our claim, and have educated us on some of the minor details of the repair that I wasn’t aware of.  So thank you to all.

35,"August 17, 2016","Beware of patriot Buick GMC of Killeen, the worse service department I have seen, I took my vehicle a hummer H2 couple months ago for a water leak in cab they told me that the drain hoses were gloc so they told me that needed to be flush them so I pay them for the labor, a few days pass and we had a bad storm when I got in to the vehicle the leak was worse than before was pouring water in the all cab so I took it right away so they can see it the water has mess up temporally all the electronic components include the GPS and radio, I end up leaving it there, after 2 days they told me that the water this time was coming between the 3 center light markers seals are bad bet they don't have just the seals I will have to replace the all lights and will cost me over $400 dollars to replace them I could it bought the seals only for $50 dollars on line, but I could not wait so end up getting replace the lights as they told me, they have give me the warranty that won't leak anymore, almost a month pass by we didn't have any rain until this weekend and for the 3rd time water was coming trough the roof, I took it back I was so disappointed even talk to the managers I leave it there again, after couple hours they call me and said the now the water is coming to the other 2 light markers on the outside and will cost me again over $400 dollars to replace them, this place make me so sick and upset that I just went to pick up the vehicle I fell abuse by this place they just want to take advantage of the costumers, my friend was having the same issue whit them bringing the a Cadillac back and forward to get it fix every time they told them it was something else, so the so they end up taking it to Cadillac in Temple and finally got fix with no further issues, I thought this wouldn't happen to me because I was in the ARMY, but I was wrong, I wouldn't recommend this place to my worse enemy I am going to Fort Hood to make sure this place be off limits for service members I don't want they keep taking advantage of soldier, veterans and families anymore.",1.0
36,"August 16, 2016","I went online and found the car that I wanted at a few different dealerships. Patriot was the only one to respond. I spoke with sales lady LaShanda Wilson who was very nice and extremely professional over the phone. I then drove from Austin to Killeen and met with her and test drove the vehicle. Needless to say, I drove away with the car of my dreams. Yes I would recommend Patriot Buick GMC to everyone. They are fast, curtious and very professional but yet not pushy. ",5.0
37,"August 15, 2016","It was great because of the agent that I had. He knew everything about the two trucks the I bought. I have never had that type of experience before. He did not have to go in great details about it. But he made sure that I understood everything. That's why it great. Being in the military for so long, this is how a dealer ship should work.",5.0
38,"August 05, 2016","Shonda, our sales rep was nice, helpful, & patient. She had a bow on the hood of the car when we arrived. That made us feel special.  She answered all of our questions expeditiously. We live 7 hours away & found the vehicle online & had several questions about it since we couldn't see it in person. I was very pleased with the way she handled herself & wasn't pushy. I don't like pushy sales people-at all! She gave us her personal cell # and told me it was ok to call or text her on her day off. She worked hard & went the extra mile to earn our business.  The only thing that I have concern on, is I asked if the vehicle had any dents, scratches, door dings, scrapes etc. she said that it didn't have ""ANY dents, scratches, dings, or bruises"" ""it is in excellent condition."" That was NOT true. The vehicle has a bad deep dent in the fender, several door dings down to the metal, several deep scratches all over it. If I knew about these, I wouldn't have driven that far to purchase it. After we drove that far & already taken a loan w/ our bank and had the check to pay for the car I felt as if we had to purchase it. By used car sales standards-that may be considered excellent condition. Shonda had the service dept. shampoo some of the stains (not all-but major ones) out of the seats for us while we signed papers. She did what she could to make us happy. She had already sent it to be shampooed before we traveled to pick it up, but several stains were missed. The vehicle only came with one key & the dealership refused to purchase another one. I was never told that there was only one key. Maybe this is a new norm??  I have ALWAYS received 2 keys with EVERY (several) vehicle I have purchased. A 2nd key cost $321. Finally, we got the dealership to agree to pay for half of the key cost. Patriot was not willing to budge when we offered them $500 less on purchase price. Then we offered $250 less, they still wouldn't budge. This vehicle had been on their lot 3+ mos & had been sold recently, but the buyer's credit/loan wasn't approved so I figured they would want this vehicle sold. The F&I guy was somewhat friendly-fake nice. You could tell he had the same speech for everyone. Wasn't genuine. ",4.8

42,"July 19, 2016","Mr. Adam was very attentive and informative about the vehicle I purchased and he actually went out of his way to show me a great deal on a brand new vehicle instead of a used vehicle that basically allowed me a 100% guarantee for just $5,000 more",4.6

79,"September 09, 2006","I would only recommend this dealer for highly experienced buyers, otherwise you are likely to get burned. The sales staff are very nice however they have little negotiating authority and have to run back and forth to the sales manager for everything. Before you go to this dealer 1. know the value of your trade and 2. know what the prices are of the car you would like to buy either new or used. Again I would only recommend this dealer to experienced people who have bought several cars and know the process and figures well (still use extreme caution & do not let your guard down or start feeling guilty about not ""meeting them half way""). The ""sales manager"" with the slicked back hair and gold chains gives you an idea of this dealers environment.",2.2
