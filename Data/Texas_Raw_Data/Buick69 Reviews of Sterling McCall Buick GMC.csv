0,"May 10, 2020","I bought a brand new 2020 GMC Acadia AT4. Truth be told, I liked my salesman Keith Mack very much. There were a couple of things I didn't like where I felt they were trying to pull a fast one:

1. When they pulled up the actual vehicle it didn't have a moonroof like the online pics. They got one with a moonroof and then tried to charge me more for it. 
2. Don't let them fool you into the ""Pro Package"" and ""Resistall"" that's already installed. Or at least don't let them charge you for it. I had to fight but $2100 of BS was removed from my sales order. 

All said, my sales experience wasn't terrible. They tried to squeeze me on my trade, tried to include some BS on my order, and tried to bait and switch where the pics online didn't match the actual vehicle. It's typical stuff I expected but I feel I got everything that I wanted. 

My real problems came afterwards. At about 73 miles it sputtered out and left my wife stranded on the side of the road. Yes, at 73 miles - just SEVENTY-THREE - before we burned a tank of gas! They fixed it and were apologetic but nothing else. 

After 1 tank of gas, at about 350 miles, the door locks failed and we couldn't open the doors - thank God my kids weren't stuck inside! Houston is HOT and I didn't spend all this money for an unreliable vehicle. The GM Casey was extremely apologetic and assured me he'd help and get us into something else to make the situation right. 

Unfortunately, when the paperwork arrived it reaffirmed the negative stereotype many dealerships like this have rightly earned: I was expected to eat a $10k loss and buy a new car at a ""generous"" discount just barely below advertised price. Casey promised that this was the best he could do and that nobody would be able to even come close since he was taking my situation into consideration. He welcomed me to shop his proposal and I got a better deal at the very next dealership. 

Buyer beware - especially dealing with GM Kimono ""Casey"" Cooper. Lots of useless lip service and zero meaningful action.",1.0
1,"March 26, 2020",Total rip off! Took  over 2 hours to do a diesel oil change on a 2019 2500HD. Made the mistake of agreeing to their topping off the DEF! $44.42 for 2 gallons which is disgusting considering I pay between $3-4 at the pump per gallon! Air pressure on back 2 tires differed by 6 lbs! Shoddy work!,1.0
2,"December 26, 2019","... but plenty of time to do it over. We picked up our new (to us) 2017 GMC Acadia Denali the day after purchasing it, since it would take some time to certify the vehicle. Our sales experience was exceptional, as have pretty much all of our transactions at Sterling McCall locations been (we've likely sent several employees' kids to college over the years). Debbie Roberts, our salesperson (go see her ... she's terrific!), went over all aspects of the 172-point inspection, and we were confident that we'd purchased a car in as fine a mechanical condition as it was aesthetically. Upon literally driving off the lot, we heard a loud rattle coming from the driver's door, and, of course, immediately headed back to the dealership. While adjusting the passenger power seat, my wife discovered that the lumbar support wasn't working. Debbie set up an appointment, and referred me to Sam in Service. I explained the issues and caught the dealer's shuttle back home. The following day, I was informed that the rattle was caused by two coins that somehow managed to wedge themselves down into the door handle ... simple fix. Sam also advised me that the tech found the lumbar support to be working. Needing the vehicle, I picked it up ... no rattles or squeaks. Upon arriving home, I double-checked the lumbar support ... nothing! I let Debbie know that I was not pleased ... if the tech had originally road-tested the car as indicated, he'd have certainly heard that rattle; and had he inspected the lumbar support as checked on that certification list, he most definitely would have felt that it wasn't operating. So it was back to the shop for another overnight stay. Sam called me the following morning, letting me know that he himself had sat in the passenger seat and confirmed the issue, as did the tech who was working on it ... so three GM-trained individuals, two trips to Service, and all finally concluded that the lumbar support was broken! The part would be replaced ... except that it was on back order, due to the recent GM strike, resulting in a logjam, possibly for months. No problem; the dealer has no control over the matter. But my concern is, if the tech didn't notice the two obvious malfunctions, what else did he miss? Did he actually inspect the vehicle as indicated, or simply check everything on the sheet? I was assured by management that the vehicle had been inspected again, and found to be in compliance with the certification requirements. I've had no problems since then, so I'll take them at their word. The lumbar support will be replaced when the part arrives, and we can close out this experience, one which is far below any other I've encountered at other Sterling McCall facilities. Once I get my freebie oil change, I'll be looking for another service facility.    ",2.8
3,"December 10, 2019","We are long-time Sterling McCall/Group 1 customers, having purchased about a dozen vehicles over the years from various dealerships under their umbrella. Looking there first (as we usually do), we came across a possibility. After shopping around (which we also always do), we determined that Sterling McCall had the car we wanted.

As luck (or lack thereof) would have it, we were involved in a fender bender, literally while on our way to the dealership. Damage was minimal but noticeable (translation: $1000 won't fix it), and all involved were fine. After the obligatory exchange of information, my wife suggested (actually insisted) that we still go ahead with the process, knowing that the car won't be worth as much. Given that our only alternative was to have it repaired out-of-pocket (with a $1000 deductible, reporting it was out of the question ... not to mention an increased premium), I reluctantly agreed. We were going to lose either way, so we headed to Sterling McCall and met with Debbie Roberts, who we fully apprised of the situation prior to our arrival.  

With so many variables, exacerbated by the damaged trade, it didn't appear that we could come to terms ... but once we got by their first offer (loaded, of course, with optional dealer-added equipment, which we immediately eliminated ... can't blame 'em for trying), the numbers began to approach reality. Bottom line: we lost about $1500 on our trade, probably less than what we'd have to shell out to fix it. The new ride, a 2017 GMC Acadia Denali, was priced well below others we looked at, GM-certified, and in absolutely pristine condition (it's a lease turn-in, and lessees are aware of lessors' tendency to wrench every last dollar if there's so much as the slightest damage to the vehicle.) We were pleased with the deal (probably three or four trips to the management cage) ... but (and there's usually one) the wear bars on the tires were clearly visible, the fact that the car had passed the state safety inspection notwithstanding. Having done better than anticipated, we couldn't expect the dealer to replace them ... but we tried anyway (my wife is a veteran of the real estate wars, and lives by the motto, ""You don't ask, you don't get"".) While they didn't acquiesce to our request, they did agree to split the discounted cost with us. Deal!

It was going to take a day to certify the vehicle, and we had a craft show to do (my wife makes gorgeous custom jewelry). Debbie stepped in and provided a loaner SUV, which would hold all our equipment. We returned it that evening, signed the additional paperwork, and were owners of the Acadia, which looked, felt and drove like new. Debbie spent quite a bit of time explaining the various features, and we left, having made lemonade out of lemons, with Debbie's invaluable assistance. She is the definition of a sales professional (not an oxymoron after all). We were encouraged to get in touch with her personally with any concerns, be they sales-, performance-, service- or accessory-related. This is the way it's done! Most auto salespeople forget who you are once you drive away, adding to the overall negative connotations of the process. All too often, shopping for a car is a contentious experience for consumers (many would rather undergo a root canal), but it can be positive (the cost aside) when the tired old phrase, ""earning your business"" is actually the goal of the dealer. Ask for Debbie ... you'll see what we mean.

4,"October 09, 2019","Horrible. No one has been kind, understanding, or proactive. Purchased my vehicle September 2nd 2019. It is October 9th and I still don’t have my vehicle. 
Prior to purchase, the sales person promised the emblem/grill would be replaced, and insisted that was the only defect. They had to redo my contract because the paperwork was wrong initially, due to the sales person putting the wrong pay off amount for my trade in. On the way home, I realized the radio didn’t work, and the next day we realized the sunroof didn’t work. When I contacted them, they said I could bring it in for repairs, and I brought it to them on my next day off... September 8th, 2019. 

1 week later I received a text from service that the grill would not be replaced as promised. When I called service to relay that was not the agreement, I was told that the sales manager had no knowledge of any promise to fix the grill and that there was no known problem with the radio, but that the sunroof had been replaced (not true).

I called to speak with a sales manager but was continually sent to voicemail and no one responded to me. I called repeatedly, and was finally told that the grill replacement would be honored as agreed, but that the sunroof had NOT yet been repaired or started on, and neither was the radio. 

I was promised I would be given an ETA for the vehicle I purchased but again, no progress was made. I was told I could purchase another vehicle but after realizing they would have to run my credit again, I have decided against it. My husband also agrees they cannot be trusted and now over 1 month later I am STILL in a rental truck. 

On top of everything else.... I RECEIVED A NOTIFICATION THAT THEY HAVE RUN MY CREDIT TODAY TO MULTIPLE LENDERS WITHOUT MY PERMISSION!!!!! I was assured my credit would NOT be run, unless I was there IN PERSON to give my permission. 

I now have to figure out if my next move should be legal representation, as my credit has been run through the ringer without my permission. In addition, I was not informed until last week that GM is on strike and that although they have FINALLY ordered the parts for my grill, radio, and sunroof, they cannot provide me with any estimate or timeline on when I will be able to have the vehicle I purchased and now own, in my possession. 

No one cares at this dealership. Do. Not. Waste. Your. Time. Save yourself from a terribly stressful situation, and enjoy a proper buying experience elsewhere.",1.0
5,"April 15, 2019","Buying a car can be one of rhe most stressful events a person can face. However, when you work with Eugine Martin at Sterling McCall Buick GMC, it can be like a walk in the park. 
My new Buick Envision is the 2nd car I have purchased with his guidance and I am not only pleased, but excited to be in a brand new vehicle. His knowledge of available vehicles and what is a good idea for ""seasoned"" individuals like my husband and me made this process easy and not stressful at all!
Please look him up on the Southwest Freeway when you are in need of a new or pre-owned vehicle. He's the best!",5.0
6,"February 15, 2019","Highly dissatisfied with the whole experience. We purchased two vehicles from this dealership two years ago and had an AMAZING experience. We handled everything online and then showed up to finalize the deal. This time, tried to do the same at no avail. Showed up to the dealership, the Internet Sales Manager I had worked with all day pushed me off on someone else. That was the first mistake. Then the vehicles I was interested in were not even on the lot, I had to go to their storage lot with the new salesman to pick them up. Got back and started providing the information that had already been sent over earlier. The Internet Sales Manager had me put in the information into their Trade in Valet system and asked if the numbers looked good. I mentioned that they were close, but would need to be on the higher range to make a deal possible. She said No problem, we give that price without seeing the vehicle, so when you come in the amount will go up. I explained that I would be driving an hour and a half and didn’t want to waste my time if it wasn’t possible. She reassured me and sent several text on my way down telling me to imagine being in my new vehicle. I handed over my keys and took a test drive in a Brand New 2019 Silver Yukon Denali, THAT BROKE DOWN ON THE TEST DRIVE AND WE HAD TO PUSH IT OUT OF TRAFFIC WITH THE SALESMAN. The signs were all there that this was not going to work.  When we arrive back at the dealership the Salesman that I was assigned to when I arrived does the in person appraisal and it comes back lower than the online offer. When I mentioned my concern he said and I quote, “Oh that’s just to get you in the door”. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? We ATTEMPTED to negotiate with the New Car Sales Manager who never attempted to speak to us except through the Salesman with no luck. My husband understandably got frustrated and the Salesman has the nerve to tell him to “Cool Off”. I don’t know what happened to this dealership in the last two years, but they absolutely aren’t the same when it comes to customers service. ",1.0

You call them, leave a voicemail and they never call you back. In fact, I believe the contact person at the service department with whom I had to deal deliberately ignored my calls. I can't tell you enough how irritated I am with this dealership. I always had to call and push them for them to move a finger on my vehicle.

I had a difficult time returning to the dealership from the feeder road because of the inconsistent driving and slowed speed.

To date, I have not heard anything from the Service Department.  I am very disappointed because I had been bringing my GMC Jimmy Truck for service at Sterling MCCall Buick GMC since 2004.  Previously I was with a GMC dealership that went out of business.  I have always followed the prescribed service that Sterling McCall recommended.

once that was taken care of I took it back to the dealer where they told he couldn't do anything because the light was out! I was so upset! So I told him about the air bag he said he didn't have anything in his computer about the air bag so he wouldn't do anything on it!
So he kept my Truck and got an email saying my truck was ready and told there was nothing they could do! I told them my mechanic found that my auto toddle body was bad and needed repalceing they refused to change it out or my air bag! I will never ever buy another GMC as long as I live!

68,"June 01, 2015","Overall the interacting with Houston's service representative and repairing vehicle in a timely matter was great! The only concerns I had was with the durability and dependability of the vehicle itself. The 2015 GMC Sierra Denali was purchased December 2015. After only 3700 miles the new vehicle transmission went out and left me stranded in Houston (I was there for the weekend and had to return to work but the truck was not ready until Wednesday). I thank God that the warranty covered the replacement of the transmission, but I was at an inconvenience in trying to get my truck back home to Louisiana. Houston dealership could not help me and the dealership in Louisiana where vehicle was purchased wanted to charge me $350.00 so someone could pickup in Houston and drive back (not transport back) to Louisiana. I felt a better option should have been available since manufacturer was at fault (defected transmission).

Thanks to staff of Sterling McCall Buick GMC of Houston for making this experience positive .",5.0
