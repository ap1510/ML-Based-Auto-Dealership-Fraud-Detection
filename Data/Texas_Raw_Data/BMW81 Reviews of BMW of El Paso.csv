4,"June 01, 2020","I‘m a customer since Years and I made a lot of bad experience at this shop, but I never complained about it because I saw in the past that BME El Paso don’t change anything. But last week was the the peak of all, I was looking for a new X3M Comp. and got help with the Sevice Advicer Jonathan Rodriguez. He figured out a „OK“ deal but after I found out that I get this car way  cheaper in Phoenix AZ , I told this BMW El Paso so I received spam calls of them (10calls in 15min), and the worst I got Messages where they said „that’s cheating on us, we never had a chance, support local, usw.“ and treat me like a piece of xxxx, instead to make me a better offer. 
So a little tip from a customer: 
- don’t push people to buy
- make a better offer instead crying about that someone buy his car somewhere else 
- spam calls and texts don’t help in this Situation to change my mind specially if the text between the line saying „what a xxxxty customer I am„

PS: The Message I received came from someone else of BMW El Paso not the service advisor I talked to and named. ",1.0

7,"May 24, 2020","Heidi promptly checked my vehicle in then gave me all necessary information & timeline for completing 3 recalls. Despite not being at work when my vehicle was ready, Heidi emailed me all my exiting paperwork & vehicle diagnosis. The dealership and amenities were impeccable during my time there.

10,"May 08, 2020",ATTENTION PEOPLE: Don’t buy used vehicles at this location. I just bough a used vehicle cash and had a mechanical issue I less than 48 hrs. Management refuse to repair because I didn’t had the extended warranty.  Don’t trust that they check used cars as they claim. This issue should of been found during “their  inspection “ and they didn’t want to repair free of charge. I know I bought a used car but I couldn’t have found this issue with the 20 min. test drive.  ,1.0

13,"September 19, 2019",Long story short I had a recall on my vehicle and was waiting for a call back from one of the advisors after calling back twice trying to get a status on scheduling I went back to the dealership in person to try and talk to the advisors face to face. I was told that I’d have to wait until the gentlemen who originally helped me got back from vacation to go any further!! Going back and forth they finally decided to see my car and it’s been terrible service since ,1.0
14,"August 30, 2019","Purchased a 2019 X7 in April 2019, it has already had 2 recalls, and the headlight went out. Took in to repair, now GPS does not work, WI FI never worked, Speed Limit does not work. Many things are not working once it came out of the shop from repair.  The Positive thing, Sergio Perez, the Service Advisor did a fantastic job. He is one of the best I have meet. He is professional, honest, true, and very genuine. Thank you Sergio.
As far as Technicians, they need to work on the skill sets. Fix and repair whats needed, and check to make sure everything is working. ",2.4
15,"August 29, 2019","We brought our BMW X2 to get its scheduled service over notification from BMW El Paso and to get a recall taken care of; NHTSA CAMPAIGN NUMBER: 18V465000, Crankshaft Sensor Firmware may Cause Stall.  The email we got from the dealership offered a loaner, and of course we were told none were available. The dealership then offered a rental in which we had to wait 20 mins just to get picked up by the rental business.  They gave us the lowest offerable vehicle and we had to pay for the gas since it was a rental and not a loaner.  That wasn't even the real bad part, I mean at least they gave us the rental.  We got the rental, ran a few errands and while driving we passed our BMW going the opposite direction on Montana(we knew it was ours by the for sale sign in the window and a chrome decal we added on the back hatch).  When we addressed the issue the service manager said the car never left yet we showed him there was 6.6 miles added onto the odometer. He stated that it needed to be road tested for the recall even though he said prior that it never left the building.  Also, we noticed a ding in the front fender and a scuff mark in the drivers side rear door!!  We were so upset and running late to pick our kids up from school that we just left.
 Very shady practices, avoid this dealership and there service department at all costs. We will find another service department even if we have to go out of our way!",1.0

17,"June 11, 2019",I bought  a brand new BMW X6 2016 at this dealer and having a lot of problems with the tires that I had to replace  a tires 4 times in less than 3 Years. I believe that the jobs was not done right by an experienced technician or they just do a temporary jobs so I have to come back to pay more and more for the service. ,1.8
18,"January 03, 2019","One of my worst Bmw dealer experience ever. 
As a bmw owner and fanatic for over 19 yrs, and having dealt with other BMW dealers in 3 other cities I have lived in, this Bmw dealer is the worst so far. Their service has gone from bad to worse in the last 5-6 yrs... m not surprised they have so much staff turn overs and so frequently.. I am thinking it’s about time to try other models if you don’t want to deal this garbage here in El Paso. Maybe when El Paso gets a new one for competition, that might help or change things...
If I could give a zero star, I would!!!!",1.2
19,"October 26, 2018",I have to say after my previous experiences this time was great BMW does in my opinion a great job I still strongly encourage to just be careful with there certified pre owned there new vehicles offcourse are better option,5.0
20,"September 25, 2018","I don’t know why they ask you to set an appointment, when all they do is mess around. I waited over 2 hours there and never spoke anyone after confirming my appointment. Keep in mind this was the third time trying to resolve my recall notice. I will never come back to this place again!",1.0
21,"May 03, 2018",I have a hectic schedule and I was able to get my car serviced at an hours notice by making one phone call.  My experiences with the dealership have been nothing but excellent for past 5 years that I have lived in El Paso.  I have had previous BMW’s in different cities.  The service was not always pleasurable and accommodating to the customer. This El Paso dealership definitely puts the customer first and strives for excellence in service consistently!,5.0
22,"April 26, 2018",This bmw dealership is the worst I’ve been too. They are the only one I the are and I feel there attitude towards customers reflect that. There customer service is very poor they only treat the customers that have the newest bmw with good customer service.,1.0
23,"April 10, 2018","LOOKING FOR THAT BUCKET LIST DREAM CAR, got a nightmare!

Purchased a used BMW, I denied the $6000.00 warranty coverage and before I made SECOND PAYMENT, 400 miles latter,engine service light came on.
 Imagine a $10,000.00 REPAIR!
Do you EVER expect a flagship vehicle dealer to screw a customer so? This vehicle was supposedly serviced prior to putting it on the lot for sale.
Well, expect it, no honor found here. It is ever so clear, the no warranty vehicles are really grenades, pins already pulled, just waiting for a trusting soul.
Buyer beware, buyer beware,buyer beware!
Absolutely BUYER BEWARE,",1.8
24,"January 28, 2018","I’m writing this review for my parents Rogelio and Susana Corral because what was supposed to be a beautiful experience of purchasing a new car has been tainted by incompetence and carelessness in this dealership so buyer beware! My father went on Jan. 22, 2018 to finalize the contract of a Mini Cooper. He worked with salesman Enrique and Sales Manager Jorge but ultimately the contract was signed by Omar Salcedo. He specified to them that he wanted not the car he test drove outside but the car they were displaying inside. When the contract was signed my mother and he told them to double check the contract because they had issues with another dealership in the past, to which they assured they did. 

They included the tint for the windows and put it on Jan. 23. They told my dad they had checked it but upon my dad arriving home, he realized the windows had air bubbles so he had to take it back since they clearly didn’t check. In addition to this, the car wasn’t given to him clean. On Jan. 24 my parents realized one of the keys didn’t work for the car so he took it to them (2nd trip already for him due to their negligence) in addition to the tinting STILL having bubbles. 

On Jan. 25 they FINALLY realized they had sold them the wrong vehicle. The dealership told my father the car he currently has is more expensive than the one he signed for because they failed to check and double check even when my parents expressed to them they’ve had issues somewhere else in the past. Now they want my father to go back, yet again to conveniently fix their mistake and most likely adjust his contract for the more expensive price. 

All of a sudden, EVERYONE is calling him, since their sale is on the line. They didn’t care about customer service when checking the contract or tinting the windows correctly, just SALE SALE SALE! My father’s blood pressure has been to the roof due to the stress this is causing him because of their negligence and lack of good customer service. The contract, car insurance my parents are paying for, and the information to the bank don’t match at all. Beware from these “sales men” and dealership. Perhaps if they would actually PAY ATTENTION to the details instead of just trying to get their commission from every customer this wouldn’t have happened. I will ensure the entire city knows about this and doesn’t purchase from here anymore.",1.0

Had me let Maggie know I was on my way, she was super nice, told me to ask for her and she would have a service advisor notified. I met with Roy and after a brief conversation he had car taken to get looked at. Roy had to contact tire warranty, I know that is a lengthy process he was very patient , got that taken care of very smoothly.

48,"June 19, 2017","My battery in my mini cooper had died.  AAA offered to replace it for $166, but they were not 100% certain it was the battery. 
I took the car to the mini dealership and they confirmed it was the battery and I asked them to place a new battery.  When they called back 45 minutes later to say the work was done, they told me it would be $500!  When I complained, they told me the labor charge was expensive because the computer needed to be synced to the battery.  Upon my complaining, they lowered the price to $400.  
In my opinion, that is still much too expensive to change out a battery.  Even if they did need to ""sync the computer"" the whole thing only took 45 minutes. 
I feel that the quality of work is good at the dealership, but I will think twice about taking my car there in the future.  I also do not enjoy being robbed. ",3.2

I have had terrible experiences here at this dealership in the past year (car damage, improper service, lack of customer service etc.) and it was nice to deal with someone who is professional and attentive. Previously service advisers would lie to me, tell me my car was ready when it was not and etc. But Miss Judy was on top of everything and I appreciate it!

52,"May 17, 2017","My husband and I had previously bought our car there and the staff that sold us the car was extremely nice. My husband and I paid off our car in March and were told we would be reviving a refund check for our extended warranty and Gap insurance. Ava who worked with my husband told him he would receive it in a month at the most. Here we are having nothing. I have spent the last week trying to get ahold of this lady, calling 3-4 time a day and leaving multiple messages and not hearing back from her. Today I decided to call the finance manager and he proceeded to tell me it would take 2 months. My husband is deployed and we were sending him this money and my family is moving at the end of the month. He then told me Ava was in her office and he would transfer me. So he did and guess what! She didn't answer so I yet again left another message. Seriously I just wanted to know that status of the check and what was going on, so if I needed them to send it to another address but no one will answer or call me back! Never will I buy a car from this place again!",2.0

67,"June 11, 2016","Took my vehicle for replacement of a battery.  Service representative informed me that vehicle may not be ready same day because they may have to order the battery.  I replied, you are the dealer!  He replied ""well, there are shortages everywhere"". ""I wil call you and let you know"".  I did not receive a phone call from him at all. At 16:00 I called and he stated ""young lady, your car needs a battery"".  I replied, yes, that is the reason I took my car there for.  He replied ""did you leave your car with me"".  I replied yes, this morning.. He replied, ""let me see"". Well, are you going to need a ride?  I replied yes.  He stated ""I'll give you a loaner and your car will be ready tomorrow"". He then proceeded to tell me the total cost of replacement.  
This morning at the dealer, I was shown the invoice and I noticed that there were extra charges that I did not approve.  Mr. Tealer, the service representative, said ""it's an oil change"" I replied""I never received a phone call from you asking if I wanted an oil change. ""He replied"" you asked"", I replied I asked for the specials but I never gave approval for the service.  He replied ""I'll just take it off"". Then there was an approximate 30 minute delay processing a refund on my credit card.  This has been the worst experience I have gone thru since I purchased the vehicle back in January 2010.  What happened to being the best car dealer in town? Personal service and a caring attitude?  Explaining charges, calling the customer before performing services?

I park it in the garage and noticed that it was leaking alot of oil (huge puddle). I call the service dept. speak to Martin (I think) to which he can not give solution to the problem. So I drive back show them the leak and still no solution. He walks away at ties to locate the tech. Who worked on my vehicle to which he was unable to locate. He then tells me he needs to keep it over the weekend so they can work on it. No offer of a loaner vehicle. No acceptance of responsibility. Keep in mind an oil change took a weekend and 3 hrs. Monday comes around and I check the oil gauge at the dealership and its still low on oil by 2 qts.  I show the manager and still insist its ok.

75,"January 05, 2015","Providing an unbiased review based on my personal experience at BMW of El Paso. Both BMW's I have owned have been serviced at this dealer, so far they haven't let me down; my SA has always been Samantha Kirtley and she has provided the best customer service by far. Their Sales & Finance staff is the best to deal with, they make your buying experience as smooth as possible; not to mention their Parts Dept which is highly professional and have an excellent CS. They could improve a bit on their car wash quality assurance after car has been serviced since it is poorly washed, dried & vacuumed, those white dried up water marks are hard to rub off, thus my 4 star review. Overall I'm very pleased with their service and would recommend BMW of el Paso",4.4
76,"October 25, 2014","Had to call dealership a week latter for no return call. Purchased only because best price. Special ordered and will to wait for vehicle. Difficult to get dealership to get details to bank to complete loan details. Buying experience very disappointing. Obtaining vehicle at factory otherwise would have rejected this sales. If the servicing at this dealership is as ""disappointing"" as the sales aspect, this vehicle will be dumped. Overall experience deserves rating of NIGHTMARE. This dealership does retain the reputation that others have warned me about. Other BMW owners have purchased their vehicle out of El Paso for this reason and have their car service in ABQ. Only completed this transaction for ONE individual (previous customer) intervened and wanted me to give them a chance for new dealer ownership with improved management. MISTAKE.",1.8
77,"September 28, 2014","Service is STILL horrible after 4years later... I had an appointment at 11:00 I got there early at 9:45 I didn't leave from BMW at 5:45 in the evening. I was hoping that the service had change but I was wrong. and As for Samantha Kirtley she isn't people friendly. She would stay in her office, Does not comfort her customers at all! And their pricing is still ridiculous they're trying to get rich overnight. ",1.2
