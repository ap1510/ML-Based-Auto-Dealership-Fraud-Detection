21,"March 08, 2019",I have purchased five cars from Alderson over the years. I have always been pleased with the service. One of my cars is older (2008) and requires more attention than others. The Alderson service advisors always explain the work that needs to be done and what it will cost before the work is authorized. James Radwanski has been particularly helpful. He has done research on needed repairs and found Mercedes repair bulletins that paid for some of otherwise expensive repairs. I have never had to go back to the shop for repairs or maintenance that wasn't completed properly the first time. I have confidence in the service department at Alderson in Midland.,5.0

29,"December 22, 2018","Where do I begin? They never have a Loan Car; You can never get a “timely” appointment. It’s usually more convenient to let Park Place (Ft. Worth) handle ..... not only my scheduled services, and repairs. They only have low skill maintenance technicians (Oil Change, etc.) working half days on Saturday. I could go on, but it’s pointless.

32,"October 19, 2018","The people were all amazing. Brooke was prompt, and efficient, as well as super kind. Arthur was also super kind, and engaging. I was 20 min late for my appointment and they still got me in. However, my A service took over 3 hrs. Which is way to long. Also to spend  350$ on a service is incredibly too much. I travel constantly. I have had Mercedes for quite awhile. I’ve had them serviced in virtually every dealership in the west. This is the most expensive by at least 100$. 

I picked midland Mercedes because I really enjoy the people there. Unfortunately I just can’t afford to service my car there. I’ll only b back if it’s an emergency. ",3.6

101,"December 16, 2016",Aaron Wickander is a great service Manager. He kept in touch with me while my car was being serviced texting and calling me back.  My GL 450 was fixed faster than I expected and the quality of work is great! Me. Shine was really nice and fun to talk to as he drove me to my work and picked me up to after my car was finished. Great friendly people at Alderson's ,5.0
102,"November 24, 2016","I went through the bank drive in last week, and as I was exiting the drive through lane I turned a bit too soon and scuffed the right rear wheel of my new E 350 on the curb!
I barely had 1,500 miles on the car.  I called my sales person, and he scheduled me in to have the wheel re surfaced (much, much cheaper than a new wheel).
Aaron Wickander contacted me by email to confirm the appointment.  I dropped the car off, and when it was ready Aaron notified me.  He kept me informed while they had the car, and it was ready when I arrived.  He greeted me personally, and walked to the car with me, while I inspected the wheel.  I am amazed at the wheel repair.  The refinishing job was absolutely perfect, and so was the level of service I received from Aaron.  That is why I have been a customer since 1992.",5.0
103,"November 17, 2016","I was warmly greeted by the Service Manager, Aaron Wickander when I arrived to have my car serviced. He treated me as though I was his most valuable client, even as I explained I only needed a few service items that needed attention. He arranged for a driver to take me home. The driver was was exceptionally pleasant and thoughtful on the 15 minute journey. Before I arrived home, I had already received an email confirmation of the work to be performed along with contact information for Aaron in case I had any questions. The service items took a few days to complete but Aaron kept his word and ensured the the job was completed and all quality checks were performed. This added value to my experience. I'm very happy to see Alderson treats the customer as though it is their privilege to serve. I've been to other car dealerships and get treated as though I am a nuisance and lucky to get eye contact or a greeting. Seems everyone is constantly looking at their smartphones. I'll be a repeat customer at Alderson and I'll ask to do business with Aaron Wickander. ",4.4

110,"October 03, 2016",Frank Aranda was more than helpful. We left extremely happy with the experience. I didn't have time to learn all the features of my vehicle the day I bought it because my 6 month old daughter was upset.

115,"September 10, 2016","I took my Mercedes GLK 350 for its first service at the Midland, TX Alderson Dealership. I was greated and had the door held for me as soon as I pulled up which hasn't ever happened for me at any previous dealer I bought vehicles for. I was instantly helped by the beautiful receptionist and met with Dakota Hampton who took my information and gave me details on my service. He made sure the service technicians would check out the problem I was having with my cigarette lighter as well. He gave me a number I was able to communicate through to get updates on my car which was great. Once my service was done and my car was cleaned inside and out, I met the service manager Arthur and he tried to help me with the cigarette lighter problem as well. The problem didn't appear with them around (of course) but I was reassured if it continued they would do their best to fix is. Sure enough 10 min after leaving the dealership the problem occurred. I had 42 percent battery life and within that 10 minutes the battery dropped to 33 percent while on the charger. Then the chargers connection  began to come and go like it had been prior to bringing it to the dealer. I even bought a brand new charger. Overall I had a good experience with this dealership. ",5.0

119,"July 07, 2016","Bought a New S550 2015. Love the car. Every time it rains my mud flaps go out. Alderson has fixed them each time. Last week had same problem took car into dealer to fix without appointment. They gave me a loaner car. Had to return loaner because I did not have garage door opener. So took my S550 back and agreed I would bring it back and they would loan me another car. Brought back to get a loaner and the Service Department  manager said, ""NO""! to another loaner car. Wasted my time. He was very rude to me. I do not feel like a valued customer. Gave Sergio Rivera (service manager) every opportunity to make some kind of inkling of apology but never got it. Finally serviced my car and gave me my car back unwashed with Service Light on and some kind of tire issue. When I make a turn it swerves and it is not handling quite right. I have no doubt Service Dept. can fix it. BUT pretty sure they have no desire to apologize for how rudely I was treated by service manager. Mainly wasting my time going back to dealership, after I was told to come back for another loaner and then treated as if I was making it up. Wow! There is more to the story... I bought 2 brand new cars from this dealership and planned to buy another. After being treated so rudely by service manager and have yet to receive apology from him I think I will pass. Mercedes Benz are my favorite cars and  the dealership is less than a mile from my house, One reason I bought it. Customer service and a little kindness goes a long way. Too bad Sergio Rivera Service Manager has decided I am not worthy of some kind of apology. Seriously had he apologized even in the slightest bit I would have been satisfied. BUT my car was returned to me with a service light on and I feel like I am not a Valued Customer.

120,"March 10, 2016",They take a very long time to do any service. They rarely give you any updates and expected the customer to call and check the status of the work. Had to return our Mercedes 5 times to get one issues corrected and it took 6 months to correct ,2.2
