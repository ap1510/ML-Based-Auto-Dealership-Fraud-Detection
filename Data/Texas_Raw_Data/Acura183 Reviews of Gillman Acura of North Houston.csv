1,"March 24, 2020","Be very Leary of this dealership!!! I was contacted by at least 3 different people from this dealership and came up with a pretty sound deal....UNTIL I made a 2-1/2 hour trip to get there and the deal matched NOTHING that I had been told prior!  Very disappointing and upset that I even thought of trusting these people!

2,"February 25, 2020",Made appointment for service yesterday. Very easy and quick. Robert gave me his name and told me to see him when I arrived. Upon arrival at 10 he greeted me an brought my vehicle in for diagnosis. Within half an hour came back and told me what they had found and what the cost would  be.He said they could get me out by 1pm. At 12:30 I signed for the repair.and was on my way. Great service experience. The service manager Bob and advisor Robert were both friendly and professional. I definitely be back.,5.0
3,"December 31, 2019","I bought a car from this dealership in August 2019.  When I purchased it, I also purchased some extended warranties.  When I read over the fine print, I decided that I wanted to cancel the warranties. On 9/6/2019, I sent an email to the employee who did my financing and requested to cancel.  He said he would do that, but it would take about 6 weeks to reflect on my account.  After 6 weeks and nothing in my account, I emailed him.  I got no reply, so I tried to call the finance manager.  At least twice, I left a message for the finance manager to return my call.  That call never came.  I also got online and chatted, and again asked for a return call from someone in finance. Again, I never got a return phone call.  I would have dropped by in person if I didn't live 300 miles away. I then reached out to the Texas DMV to get involved.  I also decided to try one more time to email the employee who did my financing.  He finally returned my phone call on 12/4/19.  That was 3 months after the initial request was sent.  He told me that he would submit the paperwork, and it would be effective on the date that the initial request was made.  Nonetheless, it took several, emails, phone calls, voice mails, & chatting to accomplish this.  The fact that I didn't receive a return phone call is disturbing.  I do not recommend doing business with this dealership.  There are too many other options.  Furthermore, the price that was listed online was not accurate.  When I arrived, they added $2500 to the price because the windows were tinted and anti theft rims were added to the car, and they couldn't be removed.",1.0

7,"May 11, 2019","While out of town on a business trip, my wife noticed that her vehicle had a flat tire.  Due to flooding in Houston, she couldn't get roadside assistance.  She called Team Gillman and they quickly sprung into action and picked up the vehicle.  They found a huge nail rendering the tire not repairable.  

Because she wisely bought Road Hazard protection, Team Gillman got it covered, installed a replacement tire and also replaced the battery under the factory warranty.  

They had her back on the road without a single dollar out of pocket in a matter of hours.  Way to go Gillman Acura.  Thanks for taking great care of our vehicle and family.

8,"February 28, 2019"," My experience here was not good. My husband and I knew the car we wanted before we even entered the building, if that would have not been the case already we would have left.

The ""internet sales manager"" who helped us was on his phone almost the whole time playing some game. Is that what you normally do when you are trying to sell a car? NO! Then, when we went for the test drive (besides being on his phone the whole time) he did not know ANY of the answers to the questions we were asking. He would say ""I'm not really sure?"". Really??? I have been to many dealerships and I have never seen that kind of behavior from a sales man. He did get some of the fees knocked off the purchase price which helped, but as a whole the experience was disheartening. 

Then, when I received my plates in the mail did not receive an inspection sticker. I called the dealership to tell them this and they kept saying how it was not possible, well it obviously WAS possible since I did not have it. I had to go back and forth with the receptionist many times before she told me she would send me another after she checked with the other receptionist who apparently sent my plates to me. I am still waiting on a call back from her about this issue...

Bottom line- there are too many Acura dealerships in the city- GO TO ANOTHER!!!",1.2
9,"February 23, 2019",The manager Amir is a liar. He forced my hand at making a deal promising me back $600 from Acura and when I called to get an update he says he never told me that. I specifically told him I didn’t have the money to make two payments in one month and he shook my hand and gave me his word. He’s a liar. ,1.0
10,"February 01, 2019","Spoke with some one named “Nikkie” on line and through text. I made a reasonable offer, on a Honda Crosstour, but they haggled over price for literally hours through text messages. They ask me to come to the deakership, while I was still at work. I was told that the sales manager does not take internet customers as serious buyers... and prefers you to drive to deakership. I told Nikki that I could come after work but woukd like to know if my offer was accepted before I make the hour trip. He/she responded by telling me that another customer was at the deakership and interested in the vehicle, and purchased it. Then Nikki, had the nerve to ask me if I was interested in a different vehicle. I would rate this dealership negative stars if possible. ",1.0
11,"January 17, 2019","Jennifer Gipson, Internet sales manager, worked very hard to ensure our deal was fair and that we left happy. She went above and beyond to ensure customer satisfaction. She rocks! The SUV we purchased is beautiful the staff is very professional. I highly recommend Jennifer and Gillman.",4.6
12,"January 10, 2019","Bought a used Acura RDX. Dealership indicated it passed a 120-point inspection. They reported it had nothing needing repairs; in good condition, etc. In less than a week of owning it, brakes start squeaking - turns out, my car has only 1mm of brake pads left on front end, about 3mm on back end, back rotors need replacing, etc. Mechanic said, ""I wouldn't even drive it to work tomorrow without getting it fixed first.""

When I called to speak with Amir (manager), he was defensive, made statements such as, ""We have proof that 2 weeks before you purchased, your brake pads were at 5mm and no one else drove the vehicle in between - I don't know who you're taking your car to or who's telling you that but the brakes were fine; we're not going to do anything about brakes""... etc. Not sympathetic, not concerned, just defensive, implying that my mechanic doesn't know what he's talking about, etc. No apologies, no attempts to ""make it right"" as a businessman, just passive hostile responses. I wasn't even asking them to fix the brakes - just inquiring how my car passed the 120-point inspection.

I would've been fine, if, when I asked, ""Is there anything wrong with the car - anything that needs fixing?"" they had said, ""Well, the brake pads are pretty worn - you'll want to get them fixed right away,"" but they continued to maintain that it passed a 120-point inspection. 

My mechanic/shop is highly recommended by thousands of people, and they have been here for many years. Plus, my car is squealing now when I brake, so you do the math.

I would like to say, though, that my salesperson, Angelique, was very friendly, patient, hard-working and nice to work with. But overall, it leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth, especially when the manager doesn't really want to hear what I'm saying, and I get stuck with a big brake bill when I haven't even owned the car 1 week.

13,"January 03, 2019","Let me start by saying I have provided the Gillman family with 25 vehicles purchased either by me or friends that I have recommended, but none at Gillman Acura.  Now I realize why.
I know two great salespeople there and I wanted to give at least one of them a sale so I went in to test drive a new RDX on 12/17/18.  I had already been in contact with another Acura dealership and an Infiniti dealership and was already given a quote of $80K on my trade - a 2019 Range Rover Sport - by BOTH other dealerships.  I test drove the vehicle while the used car guys looked over the Rover.  I was presented a piece of paper showing me what they were willing to give me on the Rover - $78K but was told they would work on it and get me where I needed to be.  I decided that Monday evening to go ahead with the purchase if they could acquire a blue vehicle AND agree to the trade number that the other two dealerships had already given me - told my salesperson about 8pm.  I thought more about it overnight and spoke to my salesperson first thing Tuesday morning to tell him I had decided I wanted a black vehicle instead.  He said ok.  I heard nothing else from the dealership on Tuesday - on Wednesday morning about 10am I received a call from the dealership from Ray with used cars.  He was pretty rude and proceeded to tell me that I would need to sell my trade vehicle outright to someone because there was no way they could give me the $ that I was quoted by the other dealerships OR the $78K they had shown me on THEIR paper.  They could only give me $75K.  At this point I hung up and was furious...who can be this dishonest in a day like this?  Later that day, Amir, a sales manager called me but I was still too mad to talk.  I texted my salesperson and asked if there was ANY reason I should call him back.  I was told he was probably trying to make it all right.  So, I called him back.  Amir proceeded to go on and on about how I had asked them to get a blue vehicle (not talking at all about why I was mad).  I was so shocked we were even talking about this that I didn't say much.  I did, however, tell him that I had PROMPTLY let them know of my color change decision.  Amir said, well, I got you the blue one.  Now remember, I heard nothing from them at all Tuesday and this is now Wednesday afternoon at this point.  He asked was I sure I didn't want to see the blue one and I said NO.  ""So you want a black one now I'm hearing?"", he said.  I said yes that's what I told y'all.  Amir then said, ""Well, I will check at our sister store and if they don't have one then I'll let you know where one is and you can go get it from whoever that is"".  At this point I was DONE.
At this point I texted my salesperson and said I really appreciate all of the help you have given me but I'm done.  I will be going somewhere else and this has officially ruined the Gillman name to me.  It even put a bad taste in my mouth for Acura too.  Salesperson said ""I understand"".  I made an appointment with John Eagle Acura, who was VERY pleasant to deal with and helpful in wanting to get me what I needed.  On Thursday, Amir from Team Gillman Acura called me again.  I thought, well, I guess I should hear what he has to say.  Amir said that there was apparently some confusion - when he told me that he would tell me where a black vehicle was and I could go get it from them if he couldn't get one, he meant it as a convenience to me - I call BS.  Amir then proceeded to tell me that he had heard that I no longer wanted to deal with them at all.  I said that's correct and he said he didn't understand.  I said well, when your company is this dishonest with customers, I don't know why you don't understand.  I have never had a dealership go back on their word AFTER someone agreed to do a deal with them. He said, well, I got you the black vehicle you wanted.  I said ok but that I would NOT be interested in doing business with them or any other Gillman dealership thanks to him.  He was surprised and said ok Happy Holidays. and I said you too.
I am still in shock about how all of this went down.  I have had nothing but GREAT dealings with Gillman Jeep and Gillman Honda.  The people at Team Gillman Acura should really take note of how well those other dealerships are run and try to use some of their practices.  It would really help them knowing what's right verses what's wrong and the RIGHT way to deal with potential customers.  I will go out of my way now to refer people to any other Acura dealer in town to keep them away from a bad experience like I had.  This was such a bad experience that I ended up buying a vehicle from West Houston Infiniti - they were AMAZING to work with and were very upfront in all they did.",1.0
14,"October 30, 2018","Hello,  My name is Sherrie Rice. I didn`t buy my care from here, I was in a car accident and the other person Insurance sent me to Gillman Acura to the claim Adjuster who name is Rusty Lofton. I brought my car in on last Monday 10/22/18, Enterprise rental car came and picked me up, I got the rental car,  which was covered for 5 days and went on. This past Monday 10/29/18. I called Gillman Service dept. to check on the status of my car. I spoke with the receptionist name Abby, She stated oh your car has been ready. I asked her why no one called me to inform me to let me know. She said oh I left you a voice mail. I said I never received it, Abby says oh maybe I called the wrong number. So I rush after work to return the rental car, The guy tells me ACC insurance stop payment on your rental, I'm like what, yeah it stopped on Wednesday. I again asked why no one called me. I was charged $185. because of this. I want my refund, because none if this was my fault. Can someone please help me get my money back.

21,"December 01, 2017","For the past 10 years my family and myself have only owned/leased an Acura (totaling over 5 vehicles). We have been loyal to Acura not only because of the quality of the car but most importantly on how we were taken care of, at least until my latest visit to Gillman Acura. Every other dealership/car repair place I have ever been to will waive the diagnostic charge especially when you agree to do service at their location. My service representative, Garrett, refused to remove the diagnostic charge which was $160! He also charged me higher price on all of my repairs that I needed than other Acura dealerships would have (I called and verified). To top it off he treated me like a lower being that wasn't intelligent enough to understand anything. This is also the second time I have received a dirty borrowed vehicle from this location. There was crumbs of food and wrappers all over the seats and floor. When I was checking out I was told that my car was washed and cleaned up for me. I thought it meant that I got the complimentary car wash like I have gotten every time I get my car serviced at an Acura dealership. When I got my car it hadn't been washed, vacuumed, and it even had the technicians trash still in the car. When the customer satisfaction representative called about my service I told her how dis-satisfied I was and all of my concerns. She was very understanding and said that she would be forwarding on my comments to the Service Manager and the GM. I thought I would at least get an email from them acknowledging the complaint. I never heard a word from anyone (It's been almost 6 weeks). In the future, I will be driving 3 hours to get service from another Acura dealership who I trust will not only give me the best price but also look out for whats best for me, my family and my car and NOT their pocket books. I will NEVER be returning to Gillman.",1.0

27,"January 12, 2017",I worked with Mrs. Crysta Pickett and she made the experience of purchasing a vehicle so easy and smooth. She answered all of my questions with honest answers and she was so helpful and nice.

She was wonderful and I advise anyone looking for a vehicle here to ask for Crysta....she'll definitely make your day. :) Kudos to Crysta,5.0
28,"December 14, 2016","If I could give this dealership zero stars I would. We had an absolutely terrible experience at Gillman. We arrived on the first day to look at a particular car we like. We test drove it, and when we talked price, it was not going to work, which was fine. We started to look at other options. We found a car that we liked, test drove it, and went in to talk numbers. The numbers with this car were not what we were looking for. We were a little annoyed as it was late, we drove all the way from Katy, they knew what price range we wanted, and still showed us a car that didn't fit it, but that was ok and we left. We got a call from the financing guy the next day saying that they were able to work out a deal and get the car in the price range we wanted. My husband told him we would be able to come the next day, however the financing guy said he would only be working  a half day and we would need to come in that night in order to get the deal he was offering. So, my Husband and I drove again from Katy to Spring to get the car, we got there around 7:30 PM. We got to the dealership and waited because the person we needed to speak with was with another couple. When he finished with them, he came by spoke with us, and told us it would be a couple more minuets. While we waited, he helped 2 other couples that came in after us. We sat there until about 8:30. Frustrated I asked the lady at the desk for the information for the manager, I explained that we were ready to buy a car, and have, at this point, been waiting over an hour. One of the sales guys who was overhearing our conversation told me that he has other customers, I told him I understood that, but he told us an hour ago it would only be a couple more minuets. Once the financing guy was done with the 3rd couple, he came over to us, told us he was drawing up the paperwork, and then we would be able to sign the paperwork. Finally, at 9:30 at night, I had enough, I had work the next morning, I found a sales man and asked him if there was any way we would hold the car we wanted to purchase. I told him we had been waiting over 2 hours, and we needed to get back because we had work early in the morning. He told us that the car we wanted was being sold right now. Apparently, while we were waiting to sign the paperwork for the car, the financing guy already sold the car to another person. He still knowing this, told us that he would be with us, and he was working on the paperwork. At no point did he tell us someone else was looking at buying it, he was working with someone else, or anything. It was a complete waste of my time. I spoke to some manager, she said she would relay the information to someone else, it's now Wednesday and I have heard nothing from anyone. I am happy to say that we did go to Don McGill Toyota of Katy and got a car from there. The experience was completely different. I definitely recommend if anyone is  looking to buy a car go to Don McGill Toyota, they went above and beyond to work with us!!

29,"October 28, 2016","Stay away...worst service I have received in any dealership. They will do anything to get you to their dealership and then treat you like dirt. Not worth the time. The sales rep was overbooked and did not even delegate to another salesman, I waited 30 mins and when requested that I be shown the car I was interested in, a salesman simply pointed me to some people already viewing the vehicle and suggested I look at it along with them. I left without even looking at a car or speaking to my rep who had called me and made the appointment. Complete waste of time.",1.0
30,"September 11, 2016","Here is part of an email I sent to Chris Gillman and I received no response.
 
Companies ask for surveys from their customers to find the areas of strength and areas requiring improvements. On 16th of Feburary 2016, to celebrate a milestone, I went to your dealership and purchase an MDX for my wife. I asked for cooling seat, Navigational system, and all wheel drive as a must. While testing this vehicle, I specifically asked April if the vehicle had cooling seat since I can see the Nav. system and she said,""Yes."" 

After the purchase of the MDX, my wife and son discover that the vehicle did not have ventilated seat. I approached the manager for a solution and they did not give me one that was satisfying. 

After the above incidents,  I received a survey in which I am suppose to assess the company on service render by sales team. Even though this took time from me, I completed the survey in hoped that the involved parties would use it to improve on the services. Having knowledge of sales, I understand that great companies build life time relationship because they want their customers and their children and so forth to come to them for service. Utilizing the survey data to improve on the customer service to ensure the above takes place.

During the month of July, I searched via online for 2017 MDX advance to replace the above vehicle. Even though I have received numerous of emails from you and other sales individuals in your dealership, I looked at other dealerships instead of yours. I valued honesty and reliable services more than anything. When I received a call from April on July the 4th, even though i did not want to deal with her - I stay polite. She invited me to give your company an opportunity to earn my business. After a careful assessments of the emails that I received from you, other sales people in your company, and the call from her, I thought your company wanted a chance to show that they can do better, so I decided to give your company another chance to give me a better customer service. 

I came in on the 8/20/2016 at 6:36pm. At 6:41 pm, I was approached by a young lady who politely asked if I was being helped and I asked for April since she and you invited me. Few minutes later, April approached me and I told her that I wanted the MDX Advance with cooling. She told me to hold and she will go see if she has one. After few minutes later, she came back with Andy, and a man who introduced himself as Amir the operation manager. 

In a confrontational manner in front of other customers, he stated, ""I understand that last time you were here, you gave us a bad rating! So what are you doing back here! Who invited you?"" I informed him that I was invited by April and he stated, I can not give you an MDX advance for the price of technology."" I have not even spoke of price nor has anyone asked me what price I want it for. I was under the impression that the written emails and phone call were an outreach asking me to give your company an opportunity to earn my business  not an invitation to verbally insult and assault while threatening me with arrest. I truly believed that the survey was being used by your company as a means to improve on your service to customer not to abuse those who do not agree with the service rendered. 

It is very shameful that such handling of a customer is allowed like inviting him/her to be abused, humiliated and threatened with arrest in front of other customers is allowed in a large dealership such as Gillman in retaliation for a bad survey. While it appears your employees practice vengeful set-up for bad marks on surveys, why ask for a survey from customer only to turn around and abuse, insult, and threaten me?",1.0

He made it seem as if she was making things up and that we had painted the car ourselves! (How in the world would we paint an entire car we just purchased ourselves!??)  Needless to say, wife wife left there fuming.  Bob then contacted her to bring the car back up so that someone else can look at it the following week.  She responded to him and emailing that I would be bringing it up on Friday.  When I get there, I was told that Bob was not in, nor was there a rep to look at the vehicle.

39,"January 12, 2015","My wife and I went to shop a car last Saturday, 01-10-2015. We arrived closed to 5 PM. We were looking for a used Acura TL as our TL was totally lost in an accident.

The sales manager April greeted us and said something you'd get best purchase experience today. Then she brought in a young salesman Paul Jesus to us.

Paul showed 3 cars which are almost identical to ours. It's raining, so we briefly drove each and glanced interiors of the cars; but without inspect exterior carefully. When we returned to his office, it's already dark.

We were not really planning to purchase car that time as we haven't had shop around yet. However Paul was very eager to sell one to us, and push for a deal before we have had a time to think our plan with my wife. Paul even move a black TL to the outside if his office. After negotiate the price, we signed the purchase agreement...

After I drove the car home and parked inside garage, I start inspecting the car. Gosh, I was astounded to find the following defects:

1. The driver-side headlight seal was open and water mark damages inside.
2. Two scratches on top of hood was covered with glue-like things.
3. On LCD display panel, there are a couple of warning messages saying ""the engine was not run in appropriate status, need to bring back to a dealer.""

From the Caffax record, this car failed the state-emission-inspection twice on the 11/19/2014. The inspection sticker on window shows passed on 11/20/2014. When we questioned why and how this happened, Paul couldn't answer but insisted nothing to worry about this. He also mentioned the car was to be certified, But we asked why it wasn't, he went to ask and told us because only a limited #s of certification are allowed by Acura for a dealer. Now, I know this is not true. The truth is this car would never pass a certifying process as these known issues has not been fixed. 

I was so frustrated for whole Saturday and Sunday, as I paid total more than $31K for a car with serious issues. The worse is that sales people never told me the defects and problems. I felt like to be cheated. 

I bought the car back Monday morning, today, 01/12/2015. The first thing was to return this car and get my money back.

Paul was nice and helped get it through.

I appreciate Paul's assistance and Gillman took back the car without extra difficulties.

Paul Jesus is a nice guy. However the whole experience with Gillman Acura was bad. 

I purchased my last TL from John Eagle Acura, and everything went through so smoothly and the best deal. John Eagle sold me a brand new TL for $34K that time, and Gillman tried to sell a used for $31K. Unfortunately Acura stops making TL from 2015, and John Eagle does have a 2013 or 2014 TL available.

40,"January 05, 2015","I could not be happier with my Certified Used Car Purchase from Gillman Acura.  I was first attracted by the aggressive Sales Price that appeared to be well below the Consumer Reports National Average.  So, I effectively purchased a new car for about half the original MSRP.  I enjoyed the Full Disclosure on the Vehicle History & Car Fax Report, and this evidence further fortified my confidence that Gillman Acura only sells high quality vehicles.  I was particularly pleased with the trade-in value for my old vehicle that was roughly equal to 2 other estimates from CarMax & Texas Direct Auto that I received over two years ago!  The 2-year extended warranty options were fairly priced at less than half of what I was quoted for a comparable 2-year warranty from Mercedes-Benz for a similar sized Certified Used E-Class.  All of the staff was extremely helpful, friendly, & informative, and I never recall feeling the pressure of the ""hard sell"" when it came to the Sales Price, Trade-In Value, Financing Options, or the Extended Warranty Options.  In fact, it was almost ""too easy"" (getting in & out in less than 3 hours) and everything seemed to meet or exceed my expectations.  Being New Year's Eve, I was especially impressed with the attention to detail & customer appreciation that I felt from all of the employees.  They even ordered pizza for everybody (from my favorite pizza parlor, no less)!  The Starbuck's coffee machine will be a welcome relief if your experience lingers over 3 hours, and the waiting area is comfortable & clean.  This is my very first Acura purchase, and I cannot communicate how impressed that I was from start to finish.  Even though I live almost 40 minutes away, I'm already looking forward to my first Service experience.",5.0
41,"September 17, 2014","9/1/2014: I had an appointment to meet with Katherine Klein, salesperson at Gillman Acura. However she forgot to book the appointment, was busy with someone else when I arrived  at the dealership and completely blew me off.  

9/1/2014: Test drove the TLX with Brenda Russell , we agreed on a purchase price ( subject to my wife coming to Gillman the next day to test drive the car).  She found a car in inventory and I gave her $1,000 check to reserve the car for 48 hours, with the written agreement that if my wife liked the car we would make the purchase following the test drive.

9/3/2014: My wife and I arrived at Gillman  at the scheduled time; Brenda did not come to work that day or make provision for anyone  else to deal with us.

9/3/2014: We were assigned a third sales person, my wife liked the car and we met with the Sales Manager (Ray Gagliardo) to finalize the purchase agreement.

9/3/2014: Ray Gagliardo had the paper work I had signed with Brenda; however when he tried to access the car details in the computer he found that she had “mistakenly” reserved a 2014 TL as opposed to the 2015 TLX we had agreed to.  

Gillman did not have a properly equipped Silver TLX in stock and Ray said he would try to trade for one with another dealer and asked for several days to find a car.

9/8/2014: Gillman found a silver 2015 TLX.  
We signed the sales contract and I drove my new Acura home. 

Gillman did not have the emergency spare tire available (as promised on my taking possession of the car). I told them that if they had advised me that there was no spare that I would have delayed taking delivery until everything was complete as agreed. 

9/9/2014: Gillman called to inform me that there might be mistake as to the VIN number on the Bill of Sale.  The VIN on my purchase contract was not for the VIN on the I now had in my possession.

I was driving (and had insured) a car that I did not own.

I had the wrong car; and the car that I had “purchased” could be anywhere doing anything.

I held  (potential liability) for a car I did not control

Ray Gagliardo and I agreed that too many things had gone wrong and we needed to unwind the deal. 

Gillman cancelled the sales contract,  released me from liability, refunded my money and collected the car from my premises.

52,"May 08, 2014","I've been shopping around this week for a used SUV, and took off work this morning to check out one at Gillman Acura. I've spent a month researching, checked out the other 4 that are available in Houston and within my price range, and this is my last candidate. 

I got help from Paul, who was friendly, knowledgeable, and engaging. Nice guy, no complaints. By far the best sales guy I've dealt with this week. We took a test drive, went over the details of the car, and everything went great until we got to pricing. The online price was pretty much the same as every other one in town at that trim level but with higher miles. We went over the numbers, and I had a price in mind already that I knew was reasonable and competitive with my other top choice. I also had my trade-in appraised by Carmax the night before and I was willing to settle for less than that offer for the convenience of doing it all in the same place. I got my car with 2 miles on it. It's in near perfect shape, with every single receipt I've ever been given in the glove box. I'm only replacing it because of a back injury I suffered and I can't drive a small car anymore.

When I made them my offer for the SUV, I was told it was impossible and that the internet price was as low as they could possibly go. I was also offered $3,000 less than Carmax offered me for my trade. Nowhere near what I'd hoped for and insulting - but I get it, that's how these things work.

I told him it wouldn't work, and he went back and forth for at least an hour playing the ""let me go see if my finance manager will accept your offer""  and ""are you sure you can't go $50 a month over your budget"" game before I ran out of time and had to leave. 

An hour later I looked up the ad again to double check something, and THE INTERNET PRICE HAD BEEN LOWERED BY $1,000. They took $1,000 off the car that I spent an hour haggling on AS SOON AS I WALKED OUT. After telling me it was impossible. I called up Paul, and asked him what gives. He put me on hold, and couldn't give me any explanation when he came back. He told me it's normal and they update the prices on Fridays. Oops, it's Thursday. I told him that I'd like to come back so we could see what the APR would work out to, but that they needed to do the right thing on my trade since they wasted my entire morning. No deal. No negotiation on the trade at all. No explanation on the price change, or why I wasted my entire morning listening to them insist that I was being completely unreasonable - when the car was now within $500 of what I offered them. 

And of course it's the same story all over town. As long as everybody plays the same game, nobody has to go the extra mile. I swear it would be great to get a deal on a used car that I can feel good about - what's so hard about that?!",3.0

55,"April 16, 2014","For many years I took my vehicles to a local Goodyear for service or to a local Jiffy Lube for an oil change -- to save cost.  After I bought my first Acura, I realized the maintenance inspections that were performed at Gillman Acura were superior to anywhere else.  They did the job right the first time and stood behind their work and their Technicians were extremely knowledgeable and well trained.  At one time I had an issue programming the garage door opener on the vehicle and was becoming frustrated.  The shop Technician/Foreman, Mike Sadlowski, noted that he lived by my house and if I could not get it to work with what he showed me -- he would come over to help.  Turns out -- the problem was entirely with me -- but certainly that was an ""above and beyond"" I did not expect.  Since then, I bought 3 more Acura's (wife and kids) and now own two RDX's and two MDX's. 

Gillman is always very competitive on service (brakes, oil change, etc.).  Their pricing is very competitive, and I don't have to worry about a shop (like Goodyear), that may not always have mechanics that are fully knowledgeable on an Acura.

Ron Mascardo in Service has been consistent for us throughout the past 5 years since we bought our first vehicle in 2009.  He has helped us by arranging for a loaner car when we needed it, and he has always keeping us informed of the progress and with issues as they present themselves.

Overall, I have had a great experience at Gillman Acura.  I  bought 4 vehicles from Gillman and continue to give them all of our business for service.  In the end, it is because of the people like Ron and Mike that really make a difference.

57,"January 05, 2014","I went to this dealership looking for a used vehicle. I was greeted by a salesman called Andy. We test drove a couple of vehicles and I liked one. We started the price negotiations and it went south as the dealership was not willing to move from their price point at all cause they already had a discounted e-price. My research told me that all dealerships negotiate over and above the e-price so I was insistent.  I left the dealership without a car and all was good till this point.

I called a few hours later with a new offer. The phone was transferred to a different salesperson (Andre) and he was very very rude and arrogant. So I decided not to buy from the place after all.

A couple of days later I got a call from the original salesman (Andy) with a new offer but still not what I was looking for. But since I needed the car I was willing to talk about it.  I called him back and got Andre again (instead of Andy) and the same rude response. I told him that I am just returning a call with the offer that one of his colleagues made and then he seemed to talk in a normal tone. After at least half a dozen calls I got hold of Andy and told him that I can meet him halfway with his new offer. I even offered to give a deposit to hold the vehicle so that I can travel to Houston to pick up the car on Jan 2nd (since Dec 31st and 1st were holidays I didn't have any means to reach Houston from College Station). He said that he will get back in an hour but never did. He called me the next day and left a message that I can get the car at the suggested price if and ONLY IF I come today else I will have to take the dealers offer. I was irritated - its Jan 1st and there are no buses running and I informed him about it. Then how is he expecting me to travel!!! 

Andy called again today and said that his manager has agreed to my new suggested price. The way he suggested it was that as if the dealership was doing me a favor - oh come on! You are unable to sell the car and hence you are giving me a price which was reasonable to begin with and acting as if you are doing me a favor.... Not done!

Overall the experience was a bad one. The staff member were courteous and so was Andy but the attitude of the dealership was not a great one - you are selling a car and I am buying a car. No one is doing anyone a favor...",2.4

59,"November 01, 2013","I am very disappointed with Gillman Acura in Houston, Texas.  After traveling over three hundred miles to purchase a vehicle from Gillman Acura in Houston, Texas, I am sad to say that I am very disappointed in my purchase, as well as the customer service that I received from this dealership.

After purchasing my vehicle, I received a letter nine days later from General Manager, Chris Gillman stating that after purchasing a vehicle from Gillman Acura, would not be the end of their responsibility.  Mr. Gillman also stated in his letter that Gillman Acura would complete my car buying experience by providing unprecedented levels of service, convenience, and personalized attention, which was not true for me, and stated not to hesitate to contact him, a sales consultant, or his service manager if I had questions or concerns.

After receiving this letter from General Manager, Chris Gillman, I immediately contacted Mr. Gillman concerning issues with my vehicle.  I left several messages for Mr. Gillman, but no return calls.  Almost a month had passed, and yet no return calls from 
Mr. Gillman.

This morning as I attempted to leave for work, my vehicle purchased from Gillman Acura would not start.  I haven’t even made my first payment on the car.  I realize that I purchased this vehicle as is, but to not start before making my first payment is questionable.  Was this vehicle fully inspected before selling, or was I just told that it was?  I took my battery to an auto facility to be checked, only to find out that the battery had a dead cell.  I have not driven the car over six hundred miles, with over three hundred of the miles included in the travel from Houston to Lancaster.  As of today, I have only had the vehicle less than thirty days.  I priced a new battery, which is around $164.00 plus tax.  I should not have to spend this amount before making my first car payment.  

I contacted Mr. Gillman to discuss my current and previous concerns, only to be forwarded to Sales Manager, Greg Densmore.  What a mistake!  In my opinion, this guy is in desperate need of customer service skills, and is not a man of his word.  He doesn’t believe in the customer is always right.  After speaking with him and addressing my concerns, he became very argumentive.  Instead of offering a resolution to my concern, he offered to buy back my vehicle.  I asked him a question about the buy back process, and he withdrew his offer to buy back my vehicle, and disconnected the call, which was in very bad taste, and totally unprofessional.

Well the apples doesn’t fall far from the tree, because I contacted General Manager, 
Chris Gillman again to discuss my concerns and to inform him of the offer and treatment that I received from his Sales Manager, Greg Densmore, while Greg had already got to Mr. Gillman to express his actions before my phone call to Mr. Gillman.  Mr. Gillman’s actions were identical to his Sales Manager; and in my opinion, he is also in need of customer service skills.  Mr. Gillman stated that weeks had passed, and accused me of doing damage to my own vehicle, not accepting the fact that I had previously contacted him and left several messages.  His reply was that he never received any of my messages, which I believe to be untrue.  Mr. Gillman stated that he had no proof of my concerns, but yet offered to buy back my vehicle.  After accepting his offer to buy back my vehicle, he reverted his offer to buy back my vehicle.  Mr. Gillman concluded that he will not make good on my purchase, and refused to make any repairs or replacements. I found his attitude to be very unprofessional, and he also disconnected the call without notification as well.

I find my experience with Gillman Acura to be totally unprofessional, not a dealership that cares about their customers, does not mind deceiving customers, and does not care about the reputation of the dealership.  I will never travel that many miles to purchase a vehicle, and I most certainly won’t purchase from any Gillman Dealership.  I just wanted to share my car buying experience with you, so that you will be aware of the possible treatment you could receive from Gillman Acura in Houston, Texas.


 Lemon law
Lemon laws are American state laws that provide a remedy for purchasers of cars and other consumer goods in order to compensate for products that repeatedly fail to meet standards of quality and performance. Although there may be defective products of all sorts ranging from small electrical appliances to huge pieces of machinery, and there is even a ""puppy lemon law,"" the term ""lemon"" is generally thought of as applying to defective vehicles such as automobiles, trucks, SUV's, motorcycles, etc.
These vehicles and other goods are called ""lemons."" The federal lemon law (the Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act) was enacted in 1975 and protects citizens of all states. State lemon laws vary by state and may not necessarily cover used or leased cars, and other goods. The rights afforded to consumers by lemon laws may exceed the warranties expressed in purchase contracts. Lemon law is the common nickname for these laws, but each state has different names for the laws and acts.
There are two types of warranties. Express warranties are usually statements in writing such as those provided by the manufacturers in Owner's Manuals and other written sales or advertising materials, or by a sample or model. Implied warranties are broader in scope and assure consumers that the retail product would meet certain minimum standards of quality whereby the product is fit for use for the purpose intended. In each type the manufacturer assumes the liability and responsibility to correct the defect or to repurchase or replace the product.
Federal lemon laws cover anything mechanical. The federal lemon law also provides that the warranter may be obligated to pay the prevailing party's attorney in a successful lemon law suit, as do most state lemon laws.

61,"July 08, 2013","Back in march, my girlfriend and I visited the dealer to purchase a used vehicle for her and trade out of her old one, the inventory was great and prices seamed to be so cheap that we thought this was going to be a great experience. It wasn't. We found a vehicle and she fell in love with it, a 2009 VolksWagen Tiguan SEL it had everything she wanted and was in our budget. So we left because she wanted to think about it. Well After multiple texts and 6 Phone calls from George Hobbs(our dealer) And him telling us that there were 3 other people looking at the car and one person had put in an offer we rushed back to the dealer the next day only to find out no one had been looking at it, he was just eager to make a sale. So we decided to put in offer in... And then it was just downhill from there. My girlfriend had been pre-approved through her credit union for an auto loan and the interest rate was to good to beat. My girlfriends Pre-Approval was for a set amount and we could not go over. Even after explaining this to the dealer he tried to trick my girlfriend into filling out a loan application by covering up what the document was, thinking we wouldn't read it. So after that was settled we moved on, then that's when all the hidden fees came to surface, making the vehicle almost $1200 more and that's not including taxes. After Fighting with him for a good hour on price we finally settled for an out the door price. He handed us the keys to the vehicle and saying we needed to come the next day to sign the papers because the finance manager was out for the day, he didn't show us any papers on the final price and asked for NO signatures. So the next day when we went to sign the papers, we were in the room, the finance manager, sales manager, and George Hobbs. They handed her the papers with the price and it was NOT what we discussed and agreed on the day prior. When we tried to explain to the Sales and Finance manager that the price was incorrect George Hobbs Called us lairs and said that we didn't know what we were talking about. He later shot himself in the foot by saying that he did agree with us on the price but after reading the Pre-Approval letter from her credit union she was allotted more for fees so he re-did the paper work after we left. Upon hearing this we told the sales manager he needed to fix this, then George Hobbs left the room and returned with my girlfriends old car key, handed it to her and said he didn't need the sale, then looked at the sales manager and asked where the window sticker was for the Tiguan so he could put it back out on the lot. Well thankfully the sales manager took control and the price was corrected. So we left and enjoyed the vehicle. And then in mid June My Girlfriend was driving her car home on a back road going 30mph and the vehicle started to smoke, so she stopped the car and got out and within minutes her car was completely in flames. So even after all the trouble we went through it wasn't worth it. She loved her car and had to sit on the side of the road and watch her vehicle burn to the ground. Needless to say we will not be returning to Gillman and we certainly will not be referring anyone there either.",2.2

From the moment we got to the lot I was greeted by a salesman named Gary Gaind and I stated to him that I was there to purchase an Acura RDX. I told him that I am a straight forward guy and don't like dealing with salesmen because of all the haggling you have to do to get the best price for a vehicle. He said he understood and asked which RDX I wanted to test drive and he went and got the keys, my mom loved the car and wanted it. He said here at Gillman we want to please our customers and said he would be right back. Gary came back out with sales manager Doug Chappell and I was thinking here we go. Doug listened to my every demand and I told him what I was willing to pay with in reason and not a penny more. Doug said ok lets go. 15 mins later I was in the finance office with Raheem Drummonds, a fellow squid, (Navy veteran) and he did not try to sell me any thing extra,he was very straight forward and to the point. Less then 10 mins after that my mom had her new Acura RDX. Gillman Acura overall from my point of view deserves way better than a 5 star rating. Gillman Acura of North Houston was OUTSTANDING!!!!! If your in the market and want the ""No Haggling"" hype you here from other dealerships around Houston and want a luxurious vehicle  at a great price and get treated with the respect you deserve then give them a shot I did. Gillman Acura of North Houston ""You Guys Rock!!!"" Thanks a million!!!",5.0
65,"May 15, 2013","After suffering a horrible rollover accident in my Acura MDX I phoned my service advisor, Ron Mascardo to let him know that I would be in need of another vehicle.
No more than two hours later that same day I received a phone call from Ron about a vehicle they had that I would be interested in.  I thought the vehicle sounded great and based on my history dealing with this dealership felt totally comfortable and at ease that this was a good vehicle. I asked if pictures of the car could be sent to be. Because of my accident I'm not able to get to much out of the house to come take a look at. 
At that time Ron referred me to salesperson April Porter. April sent several pictures of the vehicle. I spoke to April after review of the pictures and told her I was very interested in the car.  
After $2000 was taken off the price of the vehicle and a complete inspection of the car I purchased it that same day!
The following day April delivered the car to my home, paperwork was signed, check written and the car was mine.
The overall experience was so smooth, hassle-free and professionally handled. I appreciate this so much since lately things have been difficult for me since my accident. 
I hope these employees will be recocognized for their outstanding customer service!!!!",5.0

67,"March 28, 2013","I have been taking my cars to Acura Service for the past 8 years and the main reason is because of Mike and Ron.  They both clearly enjoy working there and it shows, making the service department a very friendly and welcoming place to be.   Not once in 8 years have I ever had to bring my car back because something wasn't done right or stopped working.  Once it's taken care of, it's taken care of.  Ron is always available and accommodating to tight schedules and Mike has the car done when he says it will be done.  They always explain what was done, what needs to be done, and what to watch for in the future (with an older car).   I trust both Mike and Ron completely and there is not one thing about my experience with the Gillman Acura service department that I would rate less than 100% satisfaction.",5.0

69,"February 26, 2013","My boyfriend and I went with a friend to purchase a car and the salesman insisted that my friend lie on the paperwork and say that she and my boyfriend were married in order for my boyfriend to cosign for her. They look out for their best interest and do not care about their customers. The salesman only wanted to make money and INSISTED THAT WE LIE. Who does that?! I also visited them twice (it takes me 1.5 hour to get there!) to ask for a copy of my paperwork and the finance department was not available. I eventually talked to someone and they took down my information and said that the finance department will call me first thing in the morning. It has been a week and they have not reached me. I called AGAIN and left a voicemail message and STILL no reply. I will visit them again soon and I will not be happy. They seem unresponsive and do not care about their customers after the customers have bought a vehicle from them. The receptionist does not know what goes on there. She told me the finance department is there, but I waited for 45 minutes and eventually left. ",1.0
70,"January 28, 2013","Looking on-line, I found a specific MDX in a rare color combination.  I called the dealership and spoke to Dung Lee.  Although very hard to understand, he was very nice.  He said the car I wanted was available and asked for a deposit of $1000.  I gave him my credit card number and told him I really wanted that car.  He asked me to fill out the credit card application on-line, which I did.  My credit is very high and so Doug, the Sales Manager called me and told me the price of the car. I said ok, but as Mr. Lee knew, I had a 2008 MDX to trade in.  Everything still fine.  I told Doug I of course wanted the best price he could offer on the MDX.  He said he would get back to me before he left that evening, last Sat.  He didn't call.  I'm from out of town and was trying to make arrangements to come get the car the following week.

Sunday the dealership was closed, so I called DOUG on his private line first thing Monday morning.  Voice Mail again.  Now I'm thinking this isn't good as I was trying to pick up the car on Tuesday.  Called again, voice mail.  Called the dealership this time and by gosh he had just gotten in to his office, something about him having to be the finance man, because the gentleman was out with back surgery, blah blah blah. When I asked him about some other things I wanted to have done to the car, tinted windows etc. he said QUOTE I have it recorded, I NEED TO CHECK AND PUT MY HANDS ON THE CAR TO MAKE SURE IT'S STILL HERE, and more blah, blah, blah.  I finally interrupted him and said before we go any further, you needed to positively insure to me the car was still there. (Don't forget I had put a $1000 deposit on the car).  He said he would check and get right back to me.

He NEVER called me back.  I called his private call again and told him the deal was off.  Later in the evening, the salesman, Mr. Lee left a voice mail message that he could get me another car!  Of course the one I put the deposit on was sold.  The integrity of the SALES MANAGER DOUG is non-existent.  If they had the last car on earth that I wanted, I wouldn't buy it from them.

71,"January 17, 2013","I've had two Acura TLs, both serviced by Gillman Acura for years. The first was acquired elsewhere, the second I bought from Gillman based on my service experience. Scheduling an appointment for regular service is always easy and convenient, and loaner cars are always available. On several occasions I've needed emergency or unscheduled service, such as tires repaired or replaced, and they've always managed to work within my available time. Their courtesy is impeccable, and their waiting area - if you should need it - is well appointed. It should go without saying at a luxury dealership such as this that I've had no complaints whatsoever with their work. I've had no complaints with Gillman, ever, but some of my peers who own other luxury brands seem to have constant complaints about their cars and service departments. I've owned other luxury brands myself and Gillman's service exceeds them all. Acura makes an exemplary product, and Gillman Acura sells and services them in an exemplary fashion. I recommend them highly, and trust them enough that Gillman will be my first destination this summer when my daughter is old enough to buy her first car.",5.0
72,"December 10, 2012","I'm from out of state and was looking to purchase a used Discovery.  I talked with the salesman and agreed with the listed price.  I asked if I could put a deposit down so I could get an independent inspection done on the car.  The salesman said I would have to put a $1000 deposit down (on a $9,000 car) and he would only hold it for 24 hours.  I asked if he could hold it for more than that in case I couldn't get the inspection done the next day and he said he would have to ask the manager and call me back.  He called me back 5 minutes later and said that not only could they not hold it for more than 24 hours, but now he wouldn't accept a deposit at all.  He said if I wanted the car, I would have to purchase the car right then without being able to get an inspection done.

I got a very funny vibe from the whole conversation.  When they changed their minds about holding the car for 24 hours after I mentioned inspection makes me feel they were trying to sucker someone into buying a car with known problems.  I would not trust them at all.",2.2
73,"December 04, 2012","Our experience at Gillman Acura was positive. Shannon gave us a great description of the vehicle and without doubt we could tell he understood his job and the product he was representing. Shannon was friendly gave some of his back ground, experience, education and history. Chris sealed the deal by showing us Gillman family members are directly involved in the day to day operation of the business - very important in my opinion. 

Austin handled the financial matters very professionally not pushy but thorough another highly educated employee that seemed to enjoy working at Gillman. 

My wife and I walked into the dealership for a look at a new product and walked out with keys in our hand to a new RDX. We felt like our trade was in line with fair market value and the price of the car was most reasonable. In fact later the same night we sold another car to Gillman and they were consistent with our handling with that transaction as well. Doug handled the second deal and was pleasant to work with. 

I highly recommend Gillman to anyone looking for a dealership with a strong work ethic and employees and owners that care about customer service. These folks are all about it. ",4.8

I would not recommend using that particular Acura dealership. ",2.6

77,"September 14, 2012","Sales person was rude and repeatedly lied and attempted to mislead us. The finance manager lied about the laws governing transfer of title and about finance law in Texas. Many of the services and adjustments that were promised in witting prior to transfer of the vehicle never occurred. Raheem wanted us to sing over our trade in without filling out the mileage and buyer information as required by law and also wanted us to sign a blank transfer of title form. Also they wanted to run a credit check on us when we payed cash for the vehicle. Finally, all of this took more than six hours to finish and the finance manager needs to learn that being a veteran does not give you licence to treat customers like crap. Over all a terrible experience and if  i had not been so enamored with the car I never would have let them treat my wife and I so poorly.",2.3

After all that is what they advertise on their website ""state of the art auto body shop"". When I went to pick it up, I started pointing out the poor job they had done with the car, it had swirl marks, paint runs, compound all over, blend lines, over spray molding mirror, the vertical moldings were scratched and sticky, and the car was dusty and filthy. The body shop manager, Randy Ille was rude and disrespectful when I pointed out the poor job they did on my car. He said ""I don't care if you don't like it"".
I took it back to get viewed/inspected by someone else, in this case the body shop manager and he said I could not expect it to look like a brand new car, I just wanted to look right and just like the other side.

When I brought my car in to have some work done I let Ron in service know I was ready to buy another Acura. I let him know the type of car, color, interior etc. and within the hour April in sales called me with just the right car. 

I decided on a certified used TXS and I couldn't be happier. April was pleasant and easy to work with and she made sure the car had everything I asked for and more. I thought car buying was suppose to be painful, but everyone treated me so well it was a actually fun. Even the financing with Raheem was a breeze.

I was comfortable with the whole process...I never felt like I was being mislead or thrown a sales pitch. I used USAA's car buying service and not only did they meet that price, but came down some more.  I got the exact car I wanted for the price I wanted and my Raheem and Luis were nothing but honest.  No sales type pitches, no phony promises - great service, good people. Will always buy and service my vehicle at Gillman. ",5.0
82,"April 10, 2012","From my original internet inquiry, Jordan showed respect and courtesy by offering initial information by phone without pressing excessively. Gillman people followed up with additional calls planning a test drive.  When my wife and I came in for the drive, Jordan made himself immediately available for the drive.  He demonstrated all the functions of the MDX during the test drive.  We were already pretty much sold on the car based on personal research, but the test drive and his demeanor gave us confidence to proceed to the pricing stage. 

We had just come directly from a bad experience with a Mazda dealership where they played the infamous changing price game when financing was discussed. I have some past experience selling BMWs years ago, so I am not a novice at buying cars and as I said before, I do my research before shopping and have a decent feel for what price is fair. I felt they jerked me around. Jordan, in contrast, met my price expectations and did not play games.  This made it simple and enjoyable to close the deal.  Financing at 1.9% was a big plus too.

The finance manager was very friendly and made spending more for this vehicle than our first home also painless while explaining the benefits of various coverages. Delivery of the vehicle only took an hour or so and we were happily on our way. My wife thoroughly enjoyed driving the MDX home.  Jordan-you were right.  The DVD of songs that came with the MDX Tech Audio were awsome and really showcased the new technology.

In short, this experience was great and how buying a car should feel.  Thanks to all.",5.0

85,"April 02, 2012","This was a pleasant buying experience from start to finish.  

On our first visit to the dealership, it was Yousef who took us on a drive in the Acura MDX and actually pointed out the features that made us decide on the Acura.  The only reason we didn't use him to buy the vehicle was because it appeared on the web site that we'd get a better deal going through the internet department.  

Jordan did a great job communicating via email in a timely and informative manner.  His quick response and friendly manner encouraged us to make the appointment to come in.  We arrived early and Jordan was tied up with another customer when we arrived at the dealership for our appointment.  He introduced us to April, who worked with us through the negotiations for the final deal.  She was knowledgeable, friendly, and made us feel very comfortable negotiating a good price for ourselves.  We appreciated the efforts of the Sales Manager to help ensure we had a nice loaner car overnight, instead of waiting for our car to be delivered.  We were tired and his concern for our having a long wait was very thoughtful.

Jordan also did a great job helping me become familiar with the vehicle when I picked it up on Saturday.  I had occasion to call April on Saturday afternoon when we needed to know why our car wouldn't start and she was immediately helpful and patient.  

This was not a high pressure sale.  Had that been our experience, at any point, we would have walked out.  Overall, both my husband and I agree this was a better buying experience than our BMW purchase a couple of years ago.  Thanks!",5.0

Two months later the AC must have obvious leak becasue AC would not blow anything but warm air. Had to add freon and hope that this is not something am going to have to have serviced or constantly having to charge up and/or repair/replace.  Not much confidence in something that the dealer obviously was trying to promote as a major benefit (150 point inspection) and used to try to increase customer confidence in the purchase - unfortunate fact.
Salesman verbally promised an owners manual would be provided as part of our purchase agreement since there was not one that came with the vehicle. After 3 months, several phone calls and emails, I still have not received the owners manual and thought I would share this with you and express my disappointment. It may one day show up in the mail but have had to send my daughter off to school and hope she does not have need for the owners manual to try and figure out something with the truck before I can get her one.

I came back because of the &quot;EXCELLENT SERVICE&quot; and friendliness of the staff.  It is the employees:  sales, Finance, cashiers, the shuttle persons, the parts and the service persons and their attention to me, the Customer, that make Gillman Acura the reason I came back.  I missed the genuine concern for me as a customer and the care given to both me and my car when in for service.  What else can I say except, &quot;way to go Gillman, way to go!&quot;

Thanks Linda for being there with me and getting me back into another great car -- ACURA -- for life!!!  I love driving my Acura TL and am so glad to have one back in my  garage.  Thanks again!

Mr. Dunlop kept moving from customer to customer and ""plopping"" papers down for me to sign with little explanation and just leaving for me to finish the paperwork on my own, and then picking it up when he was done with another customer.  I did not feel that there was much one-on-one attention.  The wait to have the car washed and detailed was very long... Why the car was not better prepped for the sale I don't know.

He is very personable, knowledgeable of the vehicle and gave a great tutorial when going over the Technology Package.

132,"May 20, 2011","This was my first car purchase in a number of years.  I have typically leased cars because I dreaded the car buying experience so much.  I chose to go the internet sales route because I knew dealerships typically had folks asigned to the internet sales. I had visited Lexus and Volvo prior to coming to Acura and did not enjoyed being bombarded or ignored when I walked in the showroom so it was a huge benefit for me to have someone to ask for.  

Wayne went above and beyond to make the car buying experience a GREAT one.  One of my first cars I owned was a Honda Civic purchased in the early 90's from Gillman Honda in San Antonio.  I remember that experience being very positive as well and it was nice to see that the service that Gillman continues to provide is exceptional. Though my initial visit took place later in the evening on a Wedneday the Wayne, Ray and Louis didn't rush a single step.  I came back in on Thursday to finalize the deal with finance and enjoyed working with Doug.  He was very well prepared for my questions. I must admit that I probably owe Louis an apology for being a bit short with him.  I was not prepared for the finance talk that late in the evening so it caught me off guard.  

The auto industry is pretty challenging and I can imagine it's difficult to find good talent.  Given the challenges of the business, varying customer needs and personalities it can be difficult for the consumer to have a positive car buying experience.  Wayne mentioned that he is pretty new to the organization and I feel he's a great asset to your team.  ",5.0

We purchased our 3.2 TL from Gillman in 2001 and these 3 individuals have helped keep my car performing like new through 170K miles. From accommodating emergency appointments, loaner cars, quick service turnarounds and unparalleled integrity, these guys are such a pleasure to deal with.

It's said that a great price may get you in the door but exceptional service keeps you coming back. This couldn't be truer than with these guys on the Gillman Acura North Houston Service Team.

142,"March 21, 2011","The reason why I gave such low ratings is because, I have never experienced such horrible customer service in my life. I visited before with quite the same experience, thinking they would have changed their way. Well, they didn't. 
My first experience, when my son and I went looking for a car. I hoped to get him a(n) Acura TL, used of course. When we first arrived, no one greeted us, no one sought to ask if we needed any type of help, I had to search for a salesman. He found us a TL 04, saying it was in great shape, and has never been in any kind of accident. That's not what my son or I saw. It had scratches, deep ones, and impressions on the bumper as if a car rear ended it. it also had black paint gummed over some scratches, something you would see a dealer do. We asked for the price and he said, "" $14,500,"" then I asked for the internet price on the car, because, well, that's where it was found. He probably thought I was born yesterday, and said "" We don't have internet prices. Here at Gillman we offer the best price, the best price! A no haggle deal! "" But I contested to that, and told him ""Sir, I found this car online, for this car dealer ship. It said the internet price was at 13,000."" He then seemed a little aggravated with me, he began to give no attention, giving a vibe of annoyance. While my son was looking at the car he walked away, and never returned. We went searching, and asked around, and everyone seemed to give little care.
 After that incident, waiting more or less than two weeks, we returned. A little different, we were greeted by a salesman, but this time were taken to a different salesman. I have to say, Im kind of in shock. How can a Acura Dealer have hired such arrogant salesmen, as if they are the ones with the money. The salesmen we were greeted with was nice, at first. He did the little routine, asking us how our day is, and what not. I felt a little confident, ""We were going to get what we want to day."" I felt like I had to reward my son, he proved to me that he deserves this car, making straight A's, taking advanced placement classes;AP. I wanted to give my son what I could have never gotten when I was young, something, when I was a kid, would find insane! I asked the man  if I could look at the Acura TL Type-S 2007, he looked at me, gave a grin. He asked me in a condescending way ""Do you even have the money to buy the car?""In shock I was, ""What do you mean? I'm asking to see the car, aren't I?"" He replies "" Anyone can ask for a car,"" and looked at me from toe to head. I was dressed in my work clothes, not attractive. He seemed to think just the way I dressed I could not happen to have money. I replied to the arrogantly remark, ""Sir. What are you doing, you have no right to talk in that kind of way."" He started to ask, ""are you going to buy the car?"" ""Do you have the money on you?"" At this point Im looking around in total disbelief, I cannot explain to you how this man was making me feel. How he was making my son feel, how he was disrespecting me in-front of my son, I began to say ""Sir, you go take me out to that car, or get me your manager."" I swear to you, everything that happened from when I entered felt like a dream, this could not have been real. My son aggravated, went to look for another salesman, and to complain about how we were being treated, they seemed to not care, not one bit. The only thing they all said was, ""well, sir its a very nice car, and they go fast, so we look for serious buyers."" ""Was I not a serious buyer? Did I not explain my self to that man? Do I not look like a serious buyer? Hopefully at this point you feel a little bit of reality, to what you are doing."" I told the man, and the asian salesman. I wish I could remember the name of the man, once I do I will post it on here. I tell you people, no should never have to deal with such horrible customer service. I wish no one will experience what I have. It's been branded onto my memory. If you can, I say try another dealership. Thank you, and for those who actually read this, I hope you didn't experience what I did. Good day.

The only issue I had was when I brought the car back in for the accessories to be added.  The loaner car was filthy and smelled of smoke was the first thing I noticed.  Then, when I came back later that day to pick up my MDX, I found that the all-season mats were just placed on top of the carpeted mats, which meant that they were not installed, which I paid for.  When I went to get into my MDX, the 2nd row mat was not even installed, just thrown in the back.  Jeff had to get the installer to come back and put it in the floor - which again, was not installed, just placed on top of the carpeted mats.

The proper way would have been to remove the carpeted mats and place them in the back of the MDX and INSTALL the all-season mats the correct way.  I did this myself when I got back home.",5.0

170,"September 03, 2010","I was in the dearlership last night to pickup my pre-owned vehicle, and was overall very pleased with the outcome of my vehicle and service.  As promised, they repainted the front and back end of my vehicle and it turned out great!  My salesman, Raheem, was very friendly and very helpful. The only drawback of my visit and purchase was, I was told by Raheem that the dealership only lets the salesman put in $7 dollars worth of gas in pre-owned vehicles. Only ""new"" vehicles were allowed full tanks of gas.  This was a shock to me since I feel it shouldn't matter what type of purchase you made, as long as you made a purchase with them. In some cultures, driving a vehicle that you just purchased off a lot can be very bad luck.  I drove my vehicle home on a almost empty tank! I never heard of such a policy like this though. My family has purchased 2 pre-owned vehicles in the past from other dealerships and never ran in to a situation like this.  They were courtesy enough to provide a full tank of gas.  Eh, why not spend an extra $40 bucks to keep a customer satisfied, especially since I purchase the vehicle at the online ticket price with no other discounts.  Other than that, my overall rating of this whole car buying experience was good. Very friendly staff, great extended warranties, and great selection on vehicles!",4.6
171,"August 23, 2010","This is the second car that I've gotten through Gillman.  My primary reason for staying loyal to Acura and Gillman was my experience with Rick in Gillman's service dept.  He has been great with all of my service issues.  When I leased this car, Thao and Dave made the transaction easy and painless.",4.8

173,"August 11, 2010","Raheem Drummonds was a great representative for Gillman Acura.  

The only issue we had was post purchase.  I brought the car in for the xzylon and Dr. Vinyl treatments and during that day one of the Gillman people backed into my car.  The scratches were repaired but it took the ""wind out of our sales"" of our Acura TL purchase.",4.4
174,"August 05, 2010","Great service and the time taken to complete my deal was fast... I really want to thank Dave Walter for his help with my financing.. I truly appreciate his efforts... Raheem was very diligent in making sure that all of my questions were answered.... my overall experience was great and made purchasing the car alot easier.. 

Thanks!",4.8
175,"August 05, 2010",Billy Jones was exceptional in his customer service to me. He made me very comfortable and feel that I could trust him to put me in the best car for my situation. No pressure to just sell a car was ever pressed upon me as my options were limited but he did assure me that he'd do all he could to get me into something I'd love and he did that with the first vehicle he showed me. I described to him what I wanted and needed and he scored big and thus far I and my 5 children are very satisfied. I hope to purchase from him again in two years! ,5.0
176,"July 27, 2010","I was contacted by my wife about a week ago in regards to buying a new vehicle. I knew she had her hear set on the Acura TL so I began looking online at Acura dealerships near our home. I found Gillman Acura was about 10 miles away so I decided to call and and get prices. When I first called I began dealing with a salesman that did not seem to be very interested in helping me. He was slow to respond to my email and every time I tried to call him I got his voice mail. Normally this would not have been that big of deal however I work in Afghanistan and because of the time difference I was only able to deal this issue for a short time. After 3 days of playing phone tag I was just about ready to give up on buying a car from Gillman Acura. I informed my wife of the problems I was having and she asked that I try one more time with a different salesman so I did.
That is when I when I began dealing with Raheem. I explained to him I was interested in getting an Acura TL for my wife and I explained to him the trouble I had with the previous salesman. He apologized several times for the previous salesman and began walking me though the process in buying a vehicle. He understood that I worked overseas and was quick to provide and answer to every question I had. Raheem was able to set up the entire sale over the phone so all my wife had to do was go in, sign papers a drive off with her new vehicle. 
Raheem along with the Finance Department were a great help and I would recommend this dealership to anyone looking to buy a car.  ",5.0
177,"July 26, 2010","Hassan provided an excellent service so he made the purcharse a great experience. He was clear and very helpful from start to finish. A temporary manager (I do not recall his name (he is an asian guy)) did not want to fixed the broken rearview mirrow, even knowing that the full time manager promised me to fix that the day before. Hassan helped me on this and finally the mirrow was repaired.  ",5.0
178,"July 21, 2010","Im so disappointed from this body shop, I have been dealing with GillmanAuto group of companies for over 5 years now and I never had a single problem with them until today. I thought this kind of customer service never exists on Gillman Companies  until June 29,2010 . I thought I made the best choice selecting Gillman Collision at North to do the repair of my car but unfortunately when i dropped my car the customer service was missing and I personally experienced the followong, All the employees were not smiling Khaila, Megan and specially Karen the Manager Randy was very helpful in the begining until I picked up my car and the shocker begins, there was over spray all over my car, left parklight was not working. I came back the next day and brought to there attention and they even denied it telling me that theres no way my car can get overspray but Hello !!! my car did'nt go anywhere it was sitting and waiting to be repaired inside your shop for 13 working days 3weeks including weekend and front front and fender got painted, now you tell me thers no way it will get oversprayed. Now July 21,2010 Im still waiting for the Randy the Manager to call me and tell he's going to do to my car...     ",1.5
179,"July 11, 2010","I bought a 2010 TSX that is about 4 months old. I was told that I really needed to have all my regular scheduled maintenance done at the dealership for warranty purposes so I decided to try it out for the first time.

Horrible decision. Not only are they highly over priced but the customer service gentlemen was horrible. I requested a loaner when I made the appointment and when I arrived he laughed at me and said I should have called. Needless to say, I did not get a loaner and I sat there for about 3 hours. What a joke. 

I had to ask multiple times to check on things and follow up because the rep clearly wasn't worried with following up on my questions. It even took me asking him 3 times over a 30 minute span to check on the loaner vehicle that he still hadn't checked on for me. 

Another thing, prices were horrible. $60 for a rotate and balance!!!! I had more than that done, but I needed that also. I am sure no one in the world can do a rotate and balance like Acura and this is how they justify the raping you get.

Conclusion: Will never go there again if I am the one paying for the work. Horrible customer service, professionalism and all around experience. I would rather go to NTB and WOW, NTB sucks.

Thanks Gilman Acura for all the help",1.2
180,"May 05, 2010","I love Acura vehicle and would not let any other auto body shop to do the body work. I thought the dealership owned body shop would do a much better job than others. The answer is ""NO"" they might be even worse than others. I brought my 2004 Acura TL to their body shop for the keyed damage all around my vehicle and came out the paint was not matched with the skirt and front & back bumper. The paint is a lot thiner than the original and get chipped easily. They are a big rip-off service department!!!! DO NOT TAKE UR ACURA TO THEM!",1.8
181,"November 01, 2009","I love Acura vehicles but despise this dealership.  The salesman who sold me my vehicle was rude, and after this ""barely used"" sedan developed serious issues, he refused to hear my entreaties, insisting instead that the car was perfect on the lot.  He sent me over to service where they also ignored me and told me to screw off, that I was just a troublemaker.  Apparently, these didn't read the 22 TSB's issued since 2006 to deal with the defective parts in my vehicle that emerged after just a month of light municipal use. The Acura/Honda service database documents these problems and while I got most of them fixed at another dealership under warranty, I wonder why the salesman was so ignorant as to not know the vehicle would develop 14 separate mechanical and electronic issues after just 200 miles of driving around the mean streets of suburbia.  He also lied when he assured me that this vehicle was ""perfect"" because they do a rigorous ""50-point"" or what not inspection before selling.

Solution?  I finally just drove (or towed my car, rather) to another Texas Acura dealer and they handled the problems, no questions asked.  Their service department was sympathetic and told me every single one of my problems was documented in the Honda system--in fact, they showed me the TSB documents, and pinpointed why each emerged.  They were disappointed that Gillman couldn't do something as basic as an alignment check, clutch test, chassis inspection, weld repairs, brake inspection, etc. before marketing this car to me as ""basically new.""  Without warranty, the total vehicle repairs would have cost me almost $2000.  But my new dealer was sympathetic, and managed to get Acura corporate to cover all repairs under warranty.  Acura also told me this is not the first time they received a complaint about sales or service from Gillman.

Sigh.  There are some great Acura dealerships around Texas, but this is not one of them.  Shame, too--I always buy Acura.  I'm going to make sure they scam as few people as possible from now on.  Good job, Gillman, now you've got an online campaign against you.  Watch out for a nice website with your name on it, soon.  ",1.4
182,"August 29, 2004","I brought my 2002 but less than 2 years old RSX to Gillman for the Texas inspection as I moved to TX from out of state.  I told the service employee a few times that the car was less than 2 years old, yet they still performed the unnecessary $40 inspection instead of the $14 inspection.  Although every person at the dealership was extrememly friendly (maybe it's just a Texas thing), I will be taking my car elsewhere for service.",2.8
