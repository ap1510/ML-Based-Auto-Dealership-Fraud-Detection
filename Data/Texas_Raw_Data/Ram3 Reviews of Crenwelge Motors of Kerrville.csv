0,"May 20, 2020","I took my 2015 GMC truck to service for JUST a front low beam bulb change and rear license plate bulb change.  Total charges $ 221,  For about 45 minutes of labor.  I would advise anyone having service done there to call ahead for a quote....I did this and was only given parts prices.....",3.2
