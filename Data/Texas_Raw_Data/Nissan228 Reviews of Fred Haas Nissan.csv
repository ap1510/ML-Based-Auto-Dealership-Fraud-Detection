The staff was friendly and the process was relatively fast. I want to say a special thank you to Dain Whyte - I very much appreciate your assistance. 

You cannot go wrong with Fred Haas Nissan. The experience was much  better than Fred Haas Toyota County and World - who wouldn't even take the time to talk to me as I asked to negotiate. Keating Nissan is a joke and Baker is just as bad as the Toyota dealerships.

Fred Haas Nissan is the one stop shop. You won't be disappointed.",5.0

8,"May 10, 2020","We just purchased an Nissan Altima from Fred Haas Nissan. We were so anxious because it was for our 20 year old daughter in college. As soon as we drove up, we saw Ms. Patty the Manager standing outside the building. Ms. Patty took us into her office and offered refreshments. She had such a pleasant disposition and answered our preliminary questions. Then Ms. Patty ,the manager, put us in the capable hands of Ms. Star Norris. She took so  much time explaining and showing  the different cars to my daughter. They test drove 2 of them. Then she spoke with us at length; answered all of our questions; and even gave my daughter a tour of the shop. 
She was so professional and kind. Then we worked with Mr. Ivan A. from Finance who I thoroughly trusted getting us the best interest rates and info on GAP and warranty insurance. Also, Ms. Patty kept checking in on on us and I felt so taken care of. We will be back definitely because we are a “Nissan” family. Oh- and to end it- Ms. Star took a picture of my daughter with her  new car!
Thank you all so very much. Such a great experience!",5.0

10,"April 24, 2020","The dealership was awesome!!! I got great help from James Hodge, look for him when you are looking for new car. We came for a used truck we were looking on Carfax. We just missed it but they worked really hard to get us as close to it. It was very nice and the courtesy shown to us was refreshing. ",5.0
11,"April 12, 2020","I went to trade my 2017 Camaro for a used Dodge RAM that they had on the lot.
Charlie Bui was the salesperson who helped and what a great experience he provided. He is not your typical pushy salesperson who gives you a headache trying to sell your a car. He was very calm, informative, and helped reach out a fantastic deal for the trade.
Charlie is hands down my favorite salesperson. 

Overall the experience at Fred Haas Nissan was impressive. I was shocked to see who well I was treated even though I wasn't buying a Nissan. 

Definitely recommend them. 

Thank you Fred Haas Nissan for helping me get my dream truck. THANK YOU!",5.0
12,"March 16, 2020","Best dealership I’ve been to hands down, they were really helpful in getting me into the right vehicle. Unlike most dealerships that are just trying to make the sale. I felt more comfortable doing business with Fred Haas Nissan as they always greeted me with a smile, offered me snacks and drinks, and were understanding of my situation.
I would definitely recommend this dealership to a friend or family member.",5.0

21,"December 02, 2019","Bought a new 2019 Frontier from this dealer. The sales experience was not bad. However, I test drove the truck on the bad roads around the dealership and experienced a very rough ride. After the sale, I drove more on different roads and discovered the problem is the truck. I took it to their service group and their method of troubleshooting a bad ride is to compare it to another one on their lot. This means no real troubleshooting!!! Jim Blackburn wrote the service report that said all 4 things I complained about were normal. Nissan Corporate could do nothing as their ""experts"" are the service people.

Now I am trying to figure out the rough ride problem without their help. 

Don't buy a Nissan Frontier from Fred Haas Nissan and expect good service!!!

23,"April 29, 2019","I have bought 3 Nissan Vehicles (2 Murano and 1 Altima) so far; and today, I promised myself that I will NOT buy anything else from Nissan ever again.

I took my Murano 2015 to the dealership for inspection/service as the check engine light has been on for couple days. I have tried to reset the light, but it keeps coming back. 

Prior to coming to Fred Haas Nissan service center, I took my car to AutoZone and AutoZone scanned the computer and gave me the report of error codes, FOR FREE. The codes were about the Active Grill Shutter malfunction. Then, I took the AutoZone's inspection report to Fred Haas Nissan Service, show it to the service supervisor, he said their tech will take a look. After 1 hour waiting, the supervisor gave me the report which has the same error code/issue that AutoZone's report says. And he asked me to PAY $138 for their diagnose labor. So, they told me what I already knew?!?! They didn't even take out any part for inspection...

It is very ridiculous to me that AutoZone can diagnose for less than 3 minutes for FREE and Fred Haas charges $138 with 1hour wait time for the same thing. Very disappointed.

I felt confident that I was dealing with an honest person who knew my situation and was giving me the best advice and price for the car that I ultimately purchased.  If anything goes wrong with this car I feel that I can contact him and that he will make it right. I am sure that time will tell if that is a true assessment. 

I also like the fact that they have additional complimentary services to their customers. Great dealership that I would recommend!",4.8
31,"January 03, 2019","Had purchased the extended vehicle warranty. My specific package had tire coverage. Brought in for replacement and was told the tire wasn't covered. After reviewing my paperwork, I found it was covered. Service rep didn't look at extended warranty plan. Seemed very uninformed about process at Fred Haas Nissan service even though he wasn't a new employee. Finally got things sorted. The repair took over 3 hours and a loaner was never provided. To date I have had two service visits that took three hours and no loaner provided. Don't buy their bs about a free service loaner. I made a mistake buying here.",1.0

38,"May 25, 2018","My fifth wife and I went to Fred Haas Nissan in search of a new vehicular device after our adopted daughter crashed our car into our garage after a night of eventful partying. We were politely greeted by a gentlemen named Raj. He asked us about our needs for our new vehicular device and quickly led us into the right vehicle. After being outside in the hot, humid climate, we came inside and offered us bottles of Fiji water, at every other place we had visited prior no one even offered us any form of hydration which was a delightful gesture. We ended up purchasing a 2017 Nissan Versa from him, a fuel efficient and inexpensive car in which we can be confident in lasting us a long time and getting every penny out of it. Definitely reccomend Raj Lal and the crew at Fred Haas Nissan. ",5.0

This is not his business, the person that I will pay is myself. I don’t know if he was looking  for the appearance of the persons for the type of car that you have or What else but this was not good experience. 
He told me that for change the starter and the diagnostic the total price will be $1,140.00 
So I decided to fix my car in another place and the total was $400 with new parts.

66,"July 07, 2017","I purchased a pre-owned vehicle from this dealership about 2 years ago. When it came time to sign the contracts the finance person sold me an extended warranty for the car that was to last 60 months or 120,000 miles, whichever came first - this all at a cost of about $2700.  The car has been great, running without any mechanical issues.  Over the weekend my air conditioner went out. When I called to verify my warranty coverage, I spoke with a finance manager Dane White who informed me that I had been sold a new car warranty and the coverage actually began on the first day that the new vehicle was placed in service - my warranty has expired and that there was nothing that I could do about it. He advised me that I signed the deal, that he wasn't employed there at the time and that I needed to bring my vehicle in to have it looked at to see if they could do something to ""help me out"". What they originally did was misrepresent the warranty coverage and sell me something that wasn't worth the paper it was written on. I will be taking my car to have the work assessed tomorrow as Mr. White suggested - we'll see what they do to ""help me out"" since they are the ones who screwed me over in the first place.  I'll keep you posted Facebook - in the meantime, buy your vehicles somewhere trustworthy.

07/06/2017 - Update ... Spoke with Laura from the dealership's customer relations department this evening.  The dealership has advised that they would cover the cost of diagnosing the issue with my vehicle.  I will make an appointment with the service department tomorrow 07/07/2017 and go from there ... I've been driving in Houston's sweltering heat for several days now and I truly hope to get this matter resolved.  I did inquire as to what the dealership would do regarding the issue regarding the repairs and the dispute over the warranty that I purchased and was advised that after the diagnosis, I was to revisit the matter further with management.  Stay tuned, we'll see what happens.

07/10/2017 - UPDATE - On Friday I went to Fred Haas Nissan and was able to have my vehicle assessed at no charge.  I was also able to speak  both Laura Morgenstern from the customer loyalty department and the general manager John Hays who were very pleasant as they addressed my issue.  During the diagnostic process they did ascertain that my A/C compressor has failed - they also discovered two other mechanical issues that would normally be covered by the warranty if it was in fact, in effect as I had believed it was.  I was provided with a complimentary loaner car to drive while the dealership tries to reconcile the issue with the warranty.  It is my hope that all of the work that would be covered by the warranty will get done and that this issue can be put to rest.  I am appreciative of the management from Fred Haas Nissan for addressing this issue so far ... I'll keep you posted as to the outcome of all of this as I am still awaiting word on the pending repairs.   

07/14/2017 - ISSUE RESOLVED - Thanks to Fred Haas General Manager John Hays for resolving my issue with the dealership.  Mr. Hays personally took charge of the problem and worked with his staff to resolve it completely.  All of the needed ""warranty covered"" repairs were made to my vehicle and my only out-of-pocket expense was my deductible.  Mr. Hays also agreed to honor the terms of my warranty as it was represented by the employee who sold it to me.  Mr. Hays personally called me daily with follow-up reports on my vehicle and was very reassuring that everything would be handled and it was.  I am very pleased with the outcome of how my issue was resolved - in the beginning things were a little rough but after the General Manager got involved everything went smoothly.  Thanks again to Mr. John Hays for all of the hard work and the personal customer service and courtesy that he extended to me during this process. ",4.4
67,"June 28, 2017",I bought my car in 2015 at Fred Haas Nissan and I get my car serviced there as well. They are so helpful and tell me what exactly is needed for the maintenance of my car. They go the extra mile to make sure everything is done right and they take the time to explain it. Ive been very happy with everyone there and they always do such a great job.

68,"June 22, 2017","My rating of this dealership is primarily because of my experience with two young sales associates, Mason Mai and Allen Trevino, who were extremely patient after spending 2-3 hours with me, two nights in a row, trying to find me the perfect car (SUV) with the right exterior color, interior, rims, packages, etc.  I drove some of the cars twice and changed my mind at least five times.  Allen is a new employee and still training so the amount of professionalism and knowledge he presented was very admirable.  Likewise, the two managers and finance person I dealt with were also patient and professional, and they all did whatever was needed to make me happy...even after I became angry because of a misunderstanding on the price of one of the cars.  I was speaking to 3 different dealerships, but ultimately chose Fred Haas because of their patience and professionalism. ",5.0

final arrangements  a short exercise and I was out of there with my new car.  I would recommend this buying experience to friends and family.

71,"April 08, 2017","I have mixed feelings for Fred Haas Nissan while I write this review.  After reading some previous posts, I have a few opinions.  Buying a car can be difficult and emotional experience.  Do your research first, shop around, look at reviews and be prepared to negotiate.  If you do not like the deal, walk away.  Over the past 2 weeks, we had our 2007 Pathfinder fixed here and our Service Manager was upfront about the costs and I asked what I could expect before bringing the vehicle in.  You will always pay more for service at a Dealer but they know your vehicle and you do not have to always do the recommend fixes.  

Now on to our buying experience.  Finding a salesperson that you trust is difficult.  Luckily, I asked around before selecting a salesperson at Fred Haas.  There were 2 salespeople highly recommended here,  Moses and Lorena.  We choose to deal with Lorena.  Over a weeks time, she spent the time to build a relationship and trust between my wife and I.  She easily became our advocate even though she is trying to sell a vehicle.  After some challenged with NissanUSA policies around Loyalty and Veteran rebates, we still purchased our Murano here.  If it wasn't for Lorena, we would have went somewhere else.  I have emailed John Hays directly about our experience and NissanUSA.  

Overall, I would still buy another vehicle here and service our older Nissan.

75,"January 28, 2017","My neighbor purchased his Nissan from Fred Haas in Tomball and was so impressed with the dealership, he had nothing but praise for them.  I came looking for the same great experience and was not disappointed.  Fernando Marquecho, the salesperson I dealt with, was very kind, never once pushy, and constantly looked for ways to make my buying experience the best.  Each time we discussed items on the used car that needed to be fixed or replaced, he found a way to get it done.  He also figured out a way to give me almost double what other dealerships had offered for my trade-in car.  Even after the buying process took me on to Charles Hall, the financial manager, Fernando was always available for questions and help.  Charles was genuinely kind and helpful and found creative ways to help me get my monthly payments into a range I was comfortable with.  He thoroughly explained my great warranty and new financing, never once becoming impatient with my questions.  Days later when it came time to install a new part Fernando ordered, I dealt with Laura Morganstern, one of the managers at Fred Haas.  She was also friendly, kind, and helpful, and continued the pattern of exceeding my expectations.  She found a way to get an extra key made for me, and agreed to replace a piece I had not noticed was missing on the car the day I purchased it. Even the Service Department people I dealt with were kind, helpful, and punctual.  I continue to tell my friends and acquaintances about the great service at Fred Haas Nissan in Tomball and will definitely return there for future vehicles.",5.0

We have purchased many new vehicles for myself, wife, and daughter over the past 30 years.  This gentleman went out of his way to make sure everything went well through the whole process.  Truly a blessing I am sure to have someone like this in this organization.  In addition this process began via a request for a vehicle on Fred Haas website.  This began with Ms Stephanie Martinez who responded to my email, called me and set appointment.  She also provided me with ALL l the information I requested up front before the appointment.  Unlike the other two dealerships I visited, Stephanie had exactly what I requested waiting on me.  The other dealerships had add-ons for a surprise when I showed up.

Greg Sanders and I reached a very good deal over the phone, and when I arrived at the dealership, Kerry Smith treated me like I was buying the most expensive Nissan on the lot.  He took the time and made me feel welcome, offering a drink and everything the dealership had to offer.

91,"January 09, 2016","I went in to the service department today (around 830am) to have my oil changed, which I have done anytime I need an oil change since I bought my Nissan (although I did not purchase it from Fred Haas). After completing my multi-point inspection, David (I believe is his name) came to inform me that I had an oil leak that he recommends be repaired before it leads to further, more expensive damage. We talked about the diagnosis fee of $119, but if I decided to have it repaired today, at their dealership, I wouldn't pay the diagnosis fee. I approved for him to have the technician go ahead and do the diagnosis. After about an hour (around 11am), David came to give me a price (what he later informed me was just an ""estimate""). I needed two repairs...one being $299.90 and the other $179.94...which was listed on the repair recommendation report I was given. I decided that those prices were reasonable so I approved the repairs. For one, I was told that they didn't have a shuttle to drive customers home so that they didn't have to wait all day at the dealership for repairs. I definitely wasn't staying there for the 3 hours that he stated it would take to repair the car after I had already been there since that morning so I opted to call Uber for a ride home. After no phone call from the dealership, I decided to call and check on my car at 3pm (since they closed at 4pm and I would need to arrange transportation back there to pick up my car) when I was told that it was still not completed but it would be ready by 4. So I head up to the shop to make sure I'm there before they close. At 3:58pm, David calls me to the checkout counter and tells me that they replaced my wipers for free (because they needed to be replaced) and that my total for all services today would be $648. I nearly lost my mind!!!! That was approximately $140 more than the original quote I was given. No one seemed to care that I had an issue with that charge. My labor was $539, which I feel someone could've informed me of ahead of time. The parts were only $80. I have had repairs done here before, on plenty occasions and I have NEVER been told one price and it ended up being a drastic amount more. The lady checking me out kept asking me questions ""Are you paying with credit card?, Are you ready to swipe your card?"" In my mind, I was thinking ""Look lady, I'm trying to process this charge and you're rushing me to pay""!!! I was livid. Had I not had $140 more because I wasn't expecting that, what would the outcome had been??? Everyone was rushing me because they were closed, but I was NOT happy at ALL with $648. David, then, offered me a coupon for $50 off, which still made me spend more than I had planned, but I found it very thoughtful of him. My complaint is NOT towards David, the employee, but more towards the process of pricing prior to repairs being done. If it's an ""estimate"" relay that to the customer & work towards preparing a better, more accurate estimate. I have NEVER had a single complaint about Fred Haas Nissan since I started using them 4 or so years ago to service my Altima, but today's experience has left me skeptical about trusting them with my mechanical needs.",3.0

95,"July 18, 2015","Back story: My husband was calling around to Nissan dealerships trying to locate a 2012 (we like the older body style) Pathfinder. Fred Haas ""phone lady"" tells of one in particular and for us to come in if we wish to see it. Meanwhile, I check it out online, carfax, etc and found a ""coupon"" for $500 off if we print the ad. Score! After work, hubby heads over and I go to join him from Katy. Since he arrived earlier, he talks with the sales guy, Raul. After searching for the keys to take it for a test drive, Raul, says, the car has a ""sold"" note on the keys. So he checks with the sales manager and he says, ""no, I don't have anything on it"". Turns out, another sales person (didn't catch the guy's name) has a family interested in the same vehicle and they are 'coming in to buy it."" WHAT!? That doesn't equal sold in my book! Sales manager orders the other sales person to take the keys and bring the car around for my husband to test drive.

Fast forward: I arrive at Fred Haas about 30 minutes after my husband and they just barely brought the car around. (Hindsight: The sales guy was clearly stalling to give his customer time to get there.) We hop in and take it out for about 15-20 minutes. We go in to sit down with Raul, he goes to an office, comes back out, and says, ""it was sold while we were out taking it for a test drive. I'm so sorry!"" 

My husband and I were in such shock that this other family bought this car, sight unseen, that we didn't process what we were being told quick enough. 

Some more hindsight:
- 1. What car deal on the face of this planet has EVER processed in less than 20 minutes!? We were simply told it was sold, because they had ran the guy's credit and saw that he was approved. (We would have been as well). 
 - 2. Possession is 9/10 of the law. We had the keys and should have been given the opportunity to go through with the sale if we wished to pursue it. 
 - 3. This dealership took advantage of the fact that we look young and treated us as naïve prospects, which I'm sad to say we bought into, without any type of fight. We lost out on a great deal because the other sales guy pulled a sneaky move, to not lose out on a sale.

I never feel like they are over charging and Rick was very imformative and kept me in the loop with my car.  He was very friendly and professional.  The last time I bought my car in it was for an oil change and the manager (not sure of his name) was also extremely friendly.  I was very pleased and satisfied with everyone in the service dept.

I really enjoyed my experience as she is very knowledgable about her vehicles and what consumers are looking for in their respective vehicle purchases. She knew that I was in a great hurry to get back to work and she took care to get my vehicle purchase processed as quickly and as seemlessly as possible while maintaining the highest level of customer service quality.

117,"September 07, 2013","First off let me say that all vehicles are such sensitive and highly important pieces of transportation but they're also more than that, they can be the barrier between life and death so it's the utmost importance that we can feel motivated, encouraged and prioritize the needs of our vehicles while maintaining safe driving etiquette. When I went to this dealership for service on my Versa, I left feeling proud to be a Nissan driver and I feel safe because they inspected my car for free and gave it a wash for free too all with Godspeed. It's those feelings that carry on with you on the road and it makes a difference most people don't think about. If I think anything whatsoever is wrong with my car then I also know I have a wonderful dealership to take it too for service without having to worry about some other problem showing up under the radar. By taking care of your car, you're taking care of your life and the lives of others around you. They're prices also helped me feel more inclined to visiting there more.

They vacuumed my car, but a piece of trash that was on the floor, was just set up on my front seat and left there.  My service adviser Michael was very nice, polite and knowledgeable.

121,"July 08, 2013","I had a great experience at this dealership.  I highly recommend you work Kyle Barkley in internet sales.  I would try to contact him through their website and setup an appointment with him instead of just dropping in.

Kyle was able to give my wife and I a test drive of a couple models, answer our questions, and show us some features of the cars.  He did so in a very low pressure way.

I was looking at Honda, Toyota and Nissan, over a few week period.  During this time Kyle was always very responsive to my emails and txt message questions.  If I didn't ask a question for a few days, he'd just leave me a txt or email checking on me.

When I started to get really serious about the Nissan, and it came time to negotiate, it took some work but I feel we came to deal that both the dealership and I were happy with.  I did use the 'Plan D' option, so there wasn't a lot of wiggle room (google it if you don't know what I'm talking about / find out if you apply).  Also, this dealership offered me $500 more for my trade-in than the next highest dealership, and this was without me having to push.  When it came time to sit down with the finance person, I was worried about all the stories you read about how the deal you thought you made all of a sudden changes, but those fears turned out to be unfounded.  They did try to sell me on an extended warranty (I passed but might get it later).  What was really impressive was they'd told me a ballpark rate to expect (going through Nissan financing).  But in the end, without me having to even ask, they came in a lot lower than what I was expecting.

I encourage anyone to shop around; that's part of how you get a good deal, but I would recommend to anyone (friends and family included) that they start and end at this dealership.",5.0

FIRST time my husband and I have ever left a dealership without talking about a deal.  We were told that the finance people were too busy to talk to us about exchanging our vehicle for another and that the salesman would be in contact with us on Monday to tell us what they had come up with.  Well here it is 6:00 Monday evening and no call!  Doesn't surprise me my husband said that we wouldn't probably here back from them. 

I will not deal with them ever again for a vehicle.  I have two years of free oil/tire rotation with them so I will have to go there for this, which is fine the service department has been outstanding!  If there was no way for us to exchange thy should have told us this on Saturday, no harm as I am happy with my Altima, we just went in to see what might be possible.  

I ad previously been telling my co-workers to go to this dealership however after this experience that will be no more.

From meeting me in the parking lot during the middle of a thunderstorm to engaging in an hour of fellowship while waiting on paperwork from management, Frankie definitely made me feel like a unique customer and not a numbered 'sale'.  The same can be said for Jessie, whom I dealt with in Frankie's absence.  Overall, there are some really honest people at Fred Haas, the place is clean, the selection is solid, and the service department is quick and friendly.  While I was quoted comparable competitive prices on my Sentra, I'm glad to have done my business with Fred Haas.   ",5.0

166,"July 28, 2012","I went in looking for a used car.  I first met with Casey Allison, who was super friendly, but did not try to pressure me like some car salesman can do.  Instead, he was just a nice person who listened to what I wanted and tried to show me the cars he had that may fit the bill.  

I came back later with my husband and Casey did his best to work with us to come to a deal.  Eventually we did.  With Casey's help, we were able to make it part of the deal to get the cloth seats changed to leather, which was important to me.  Then enter Fred Burmeister who helped Casey out.  Fred was just as nice as Casey.  Both very easy to work with and never any pressure.  I am still waiting to get some work done that was part of the agreement, but anticipate that experience to be just as easy as working with  their sales staff.

I dreaded buying a car, but Casey and Fred both made it painless and were willing to take the extra step to make sure I got exactly what I wanted!  Thanks to you both!

167,"July 27, 2012","We purchased a new 2012 Nissan Rogue Special Edition on Thursday, 26 July 2012.  We evaluated 6 manufacturers with visits to a total of 11 dealers.  We did our homework and shopped via the internet.  We had very well defined specifications and expectations for our selections.  

Two dealers stood out:  Fred Haas Nissan (sales associate Richard Roser) and Fred Haas Toyota (sales associate Michael Gregory).  Both won our confidence that we could get the deal we desired.  Both delivered quotes that met our expectations.  But of course, we only bought one car.  The final experience was delivered by Fred Haas Nissan.  

The purchase process from start to finish took less than an hour.  The orientation and explanations we received were very clear and well organized.  The process was extremely fluid (Thursday afternoon).  

The facility was very impressive.  Clean lot, clean cars, clean office and a very clean delivery of our new purchase.  Everyone was focused on customer service, especially Mr. Roser (sales), Mr. Gonzalez (finance) and Mr. Hernandez (service).

Well done Fred Haas Nissan.  Although I spent a lot of money, I got a great car at the price I wanted AND you delivered the perfect environment for a satisfaction filled purchase.  Thank you!  ",5.0

194,"June 27, 2012","I will be honest and say that I dread purchasing vehicles because of the hours it generally takes to complete the deal.  With that said, I was pleasantly surprised and highly satisfied with the professionalism of the staff in all the departments.   My sales representative, Malek Panahi (281-516-6700), who is very knowledgeable about the vehicle and application process was truly a delight to work with.  I never felt rushed or pushed to make a decision and I was not 100% positive I was going to buy a vehicle at the time.  This was refreshingly different than what I have experienced at other dealerships over the years.   Malek took his time and became familiar with my life style before making recommendations that were accurate.  He also gave me enough space to speak with my friend who accompanied me in private and always seemed to know when I was ready for another question to be answered.  In other words, I was never waiting to be helped.  I so appreciated the manner in which he assisted. 
 
This dealership has a fantastic selection of inventory with a large volume of different colors and features to explore.  I came in around 8pm and was out the door with a brand new vehicle washed, filled up and financed by 10:30pm.  Although the dealership does close at 9pm (Tuesday) they stayed until the purchase was complete.  That included a test drive, and looking at a different model than the one that was purchased.  Note: I do not have superb credit, some flaws...in the low middle 600 range.  I also had a trade-in ($3000) with high mileage, and with dealer incentives did not come out of pocket with any money.  The finance department did a superb job of searching for the best interest rate through a variety of banks.  I am pleased with my payment and interest.  The vehicle I purchased is the Murano SUV 2012.  

I was introduced to the service department which is just beautiful.  There is a spacious and open waiting room with free amenities such as coffee and drinks.  Inside the service department waiting room is a large window showing the garage so that you may watch your vehicle being worked on.  The staff again is very friendly, and frequently checks-in with you to see if they can offer you anything while waiting. I have to say the dealership itself is aesthetically pleasing.  I love my new vehicle! Thank you Malek and Fred Haas Nissan staff. I look forward to doing business with you in the future!
