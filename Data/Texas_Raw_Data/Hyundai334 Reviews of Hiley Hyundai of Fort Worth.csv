1,"January 21, 2020",See Chad for the best deals in the Metroplex. He will work with you to get just the right vehicle. He will also work on getting you just the right financing. He seems to always make it possible to get the best deals when no one else can. ,5.0
2,"October 29, 2019",I went by the dealership to test drive a car to get a Visa Gift card.  A couple days went by and the card did not arrive so I contacted the dealership to inquire about it.  They were courteous and professional and to my surprise the matter was resolved almost immediately and the communication was excellent.  As it turns out I was in an accident that evening and will be needing a car and Claudia at Hiley Hyundai will be first on my list. ,5.0
3,"September 27, 2019","If I could give a half a star I would.  However... I made an appointment to go in to get a Certified Pre-Owned Tucson.  I did my application over the internet.  When I got there, I sat down with the sales guy, who was not the person that I was told to ask for.  Strike 1.   I told  him I wanted to look at the Tuscon they had on their website, it has low mileage and was exactly what I wanted.  He starts telling me about other Tucsons.  I was like, I will look at them, but I am really interested in ""this "" one.   He gets on his computer, and brings around a completely different one... we test drove it.  It was nice.  However, he never stated that the one I had initially inquired about, was sold, blew up... or anything.  We get back to his cubicle and he says he cannot find my credit application.  I tell him I received an email stating you did.  So, he asked me to fill out a paper one.  So I did.  Then 10 minutes later he magically was able to find it.  smh.   So... he then comes back and tries to sell me a brand new 2020 Elantra.  Which I test drove... because why not...right?  Its a nice little car...the one I test drove was all tricked out, it would be perfect for my daughter.  They showed me the breakdown of what my monthly payment would be etc... and I told them that was too much...and was about to get up and say bye felicia...one of the finance guys comes and tells me that I didn't make enough money for them to finance my purchase.  Nevermind the fact that they never showed me the car I asked about, and then they tried to sell me a completely different car.  I have a feeling they have this car on the website so as to get people to come in... ""Certified Pre-Owned, under 20K""  It was NOT on their lot, anywhere. My bf walked the entire lot while I was dealing with the sales person.  Which explains why I was never showed it.  That is very un-ethical.  So... we left...obviously.  Drove to Weatherford.  And guess what?  Walked out in less than 2 hours with the car I wanted and paying $350 less per month than Hiley ""offered"".   No issues... no problem...Dealt with one sales guy and then the sales manger...thats it..they worked with me on the price, gave me $1500 more on my Trade in than Hiley offered me.  So... we left...obviously.  Drove to Weatherford.  And guess what?  Walked out in less than 2 hours with the car I wanted and paying $350 less per month than Hiley ""offered"".   No issues... no problem.. worked with me on the price, gave me $1500 more on my Trade in than Hiley offered me.  So.. I will be making the drive to Weathorford from here on out.   After reading other reviews... I wish I had gone to Weatherford first.   If you are thinking of going to Hiley... think twice.  The sales guy, kept trying to get me to get a 2020 by telling me the cost of maintaining a car that doesn't have a warranty... as if I don't already know that.  ""Don't you want a warranty?""  Don't you want brand new car""??  Not the kind of dealer I want to do business with.  Glad I met Jerry in Weatherford.  Side note... Hiley will run your credit thru every available option....so be sure you want to buy a car there...because if you decided to go somewhere else... it shows up and it actually can be negative.   So... negotiate the deal BEFORE you sign ANYTHING.  You don't have to have them run your information before negotiating.  Better yet... just don't go... drive on out to Weatherford!!",1.4
4,"November 25, 2018","This dealership was friendly and helpful at first.  I did NOT want the extended warranty, but the financial manager added it my contract anyway.  When I asked him to remove it, he said he did not NEED to redo the paperwork.  I could just remove the warranty after-the-fact by sending a cancellation order later and that my payments would go back to the original stated amount. But, afterwards - he told me a different story saying the Extended Warranty amount would be credited to the last few payments of the note.  I told him this wasn't acceptable, but he told me he could not change the contract.  I asked for verification that he did cancel the warranty.  He never gave it.  So I called the Extended Warranty office myself.  After 2 months, it turns out that it NEVER WAS cancelled.  I would have been paying for something I had not agreed to and didn't know I had.  I tried to contact the manager of the dealership and he never returned my numerous calls.  After I signed my contract with them, they were VERY uncooperative afterwards.  They knew I was short on time when I came in to purchase and needed to make this deal quickly. They took advantage of that and used it to cheat me.  They also entered my address incorrectly on the financial documents, so I didn't receive my first two statements and had to make my payments by phone.  I feel this was done intentionally in order to keep my fooled that the warranty fee was removed.  I had to cancel the warranty on my own.  The warranty company is supposedly sending me a refund soon.  It will be a check made out to Hyundai Finance.  When I receive it, I am supposed to take it to Hyundai and they will credit my loan.  I am not satisfied with the method of adjusting the refund so even though I know I will lose money on this transaction, I will get rid of this vehicle right away. I NO LONGER WISH TO DEAL WITH HYUNDAI !!! The finance manager that I dealt with is Rick.  ",1.6
5,"August 31, 2018","Simply put, Hiley Hyundai of Forth Worth had the right car at the right price for a car for my son.  Good enough deal to fly from New York State to Fort Worth Texas to get it.  But that is a small part of the story.  Dealt with Rodney, he made the transaction as simple as possible.  He picked me up at the airport, flight was delayed 2 hours, he checked on my flight and called me to confirm delay before I could even call him.  Drove to dealership, car was as EXACTLY as described.  Signed paperwork and was on my way.  He checked on us 3 times as we drove back to New York to make sure our journey was going as planned.  Car performed flawlessly,  temp outside was 100+ degrees, no issues.  I have purchased cars out-of-state 7 times or more, have dealt with some honest folks all over the country.  Rodney was the best.  My son loves the car.  Next time I need a car, I will look here first and give Rodney a call.",5.0
6,"June 22, 2018","I was hesitant to purchase a car and didn’t have any experience buying a used car. We ended up at Hiley Hyundai just because we passed it on the way to another dealership. It’s a hidden gem that has recently changed ownership - Even though there wasn’t the huge selection at other dealerships, they had some great cars at very competitive prices. We shopped all day but liked the cars and customer service best at Hiley.

Rodney was extremely helpful throughout the entire process, very patient and did not pressure us at all. He was fantastic following up, even after the purchase. He definitely went out of his way to make sure everything was taken care of. 

Manny, the manager, was very nice and made it easy to feel like we were getting the deal we wanted. There wasn’t extensive back and forth, but instead he made it a quick process. Chapa in finance also helped make sure we completely understood the warranty and didn’t pressure to buy any extras. 

I would absolutely purchase another car here without Rodney, and I know my family will contact him first for their next purchase. ",4.8
7,"June 15, 2018","I brought my car in for an Airbag light being on. I tried to explain that my car is under the extended warranty and that I would have to pay $140 upfront. Which I didn't have to when the issue is covered. I asked them if they would unplug my battery to see if the light would go off, they told me to do it myself. Very rude and very unprofessional! BTW, I took my car to a dealer closer to my house and EVERYTHING was covered under the warranty like I tried to tell the service guys. ",1.0
8,"June 07, 2018","First of all. The other reviews can't be correct. Hiley just bought this dealership in April 2018 so any reviews prior to then are bogus!
Worst customer service experience I have had in a long time. They told me my Azera was due for the 15,000 mile service. It was over $200 which seemed like a lot so I checked my manual and discovered the 4 wheel alignment they performed was not recommended. Also they had me on the severe service schedule and they put the wrong weight oil in the car. I wrote them the next day but it took several weeks and several emails for me to get a call (I asked for an email).
I was told Texas was a ""severe service state"" because temps got above 80 degrees and/or lower than 40 degrees. They also told me a four wheel alignment was needed every year or 15,000 miles and told me the oil weight was fine even though the receipt says it is wrong.
So I contacted Hyundai Motor America and inquired about what I was told. Hyundai responded quickly on a holiday weekend no less and told me the car should not need a 4 wheel alignment unless there was uneven tire wear or the steering wheel was pulling one way or the other. They also sent me the requirements for using the severe service schedule which was not what I was told. 
I wrote two more emails, one to the dealership and one directly to John Harrelson, who had called me, telling them of my communication with Hyundai. Still no response. 
I am on my 8th Hyundai and I bought my Azera from Hiley in Burleson. I was happy Hiley moved so close to where I live but I don't think they care, they just want me to go away.",1.0
9,"May 16, 2018","I spent hours of computer research trying to locate a dealerships to feel comfortable with. So I set off on April 25, 2018 to a couple dealerships. These dealerships were very kind and welcoming, but unfortunately, I could not come to a purchase agreement.

2012 I purchase a new Hyundai Elantra from Manuel Hyundai, therefore, I decided to go by that deslership, which is now HILEY HYUNDAI. I was met in the parking lot by Derron Jones, sales represtitive for Hiley. Derron Jones was absolutely professional, kind and most of all a good listener. I decided to purchase my Hyundai Kona Ultimate from Derron, feeling confident with Derron’s professionlism. Derron Jones went beyond and the extra mile for me. I appreciate him deeply.

In addition; everyone at Hiley’s I came into contact, treated me as a preferred customer. Everyone was black -n- white, I did not question their word.
According to my impression Hiley Hyundai should be your next dealership to visit, I guarantee you will probably purchase a new or used vehicle from them...Bar-Non !!!",5.0

If you are looking to purchase a new vehicle, then you need look no further than Frank Kent and their wonderful team of professionals Sales and Service Staff! I have bought many vehicles from numerous Vehicle Dealerships and they by far exceed any purchasing experience I have ever had. First of all, they are very honest! This is the main reason I keep going back to them. They are upfront with everything and nothing is ever hidden. They are Fair! They will work with you to get you the best possible deal on your new vehicle as well as your trade in. They are Professional!  If they don't have the exact vehicle you are looking for, they will find it and find it fast. I would highly recommend Mr. Cory D. Session as your Sales Consultant! Mr. Session has been with Frank Kent for a long time and is extremely knowledgeable on all their vehicles and services. He was very honest, fair, professional and very efficient in finding the exact vehicle I wanted. Don't be fooled by other Dealerships like Jerry's in Weatherford! The Frank Kent Hyundai team can't be beat by any other dealerships around!  Don't forget to take advantage of the extended warranties they offer for their vehicles. I purchased the Platinum package on both my vehicles.  The windshield/tire/rim replacement, dent and ding repair, all regularly scheduled maintenance as well as extending the Limited Warranty to 10 years 100k miles more than pays for the cost (which is very low).

185,"December 16, 2015","We went looking for a pre-owned car and found a good one here. The sales team was nice and it felt low pressure, however once we decided to go for it all the typical car buying issues came up. When negotiating pricing you have to keep on your toes, you come up with a price and they will try and meet you in the middle but a lot of times it is just extending the loan terms out longer. They even ran the credit check wrong, between my wife and I, switching our information. Not even sure how that happens. Also super high pressure to get a warranty. Good sales experience ended after we tried out and decided on a car. Though for the most part they were very good with follow up, asking if we were happy with the car after purchase. The used car, was well maintained so I'm glad there was no issue with that.",3.8

Then when I arrived he said the car was sold two days ago, but that they have other inventory to show me.. and that he tried calling me earlier that day to inform me of that, which is total BS, because I spoke with him just before I left.

255,"September 30, 2013","Dealing with Sheri Ballard at Frank Kent Hyundai was the first pleasant car buying experience I've had ever.  I was purchasing a car for my son to take to college.  My son had already test driven several cars without me and had told me what he wanted.  My job was to try and get the car he wanted in the price range I’d previously set that we knew we could afford.  I was working with several Hyundai dealerships and Sheri was the fastest and most courteous salesperson I’ve come across in getting the deal done.  We spoke by phone and email and I only had to step foot on the lot to sign the paperwork and drive the car away.  I was gone from the dealership in about an hour.  Although I had to return the next day for an accessory that hadn’t arrived by the time I picked up the car, this was minor and did not interrupt my process in getting the vehicle to my soon at college quickly.  This was the ultimate best experience when buying a car and will always be my preferred method now that I know it is possible to have a positive buying experience and not have to spend an entire day at a dealership dealing with an aggressive salesperson.  I purchased exactly what I wanted for the price I wanted and knew that price to be reasonable.  I did not set out to stick it to the dealership but also was determined not to overpay for a vehicle since the depreciation is so high the minute the new car is driven off the lot.  I also wanted a reliable and dependable car for my son that would last him through college and beyond as this is the last car I will purchase for him.  The warranty is unbeatable and the 36 month free BlueLink Assurance feature was a pleasant bonus.  I will be returning to Frank Kent in the future if I ever need to purchase a new or pre-owned car and will most definitely work with Sheri Ballard.",5.0
256,"September 29, 2013","I began my search for a ""gently"" used car on the internet. The vehicle I found of interest was at Frank Kent in Ft. Worth - a name in the car business I was familiar with from growing up in the Metroplex area. I knew that my father had bought at least two vehicles from F/K but I had  no prior experience with them personally. My inquiry was promptly responded to by phone message and e-mail from Ms.Shari Ballard with the information I requested. It was clear from the beginning she would gladly be available to assist me when my schedule allowed. This was important to me.
My wife and I arrived at a time when most are finishing dinner and were met by Ms. Ballard. I had informed her that IF we could come to an arrangement I would like to take possession that night. Ms. Ballard had made sure the car was spotless and gas tank full. She was the consummate professional and completely charming. The vehicle was precisely as described and so we proceeded to negotiations - the phase of car-buying that people dread the most - comparing the experience in pleasantness to getting a root-canal.
I don't claim to be a world class horse-trader but I have made a living selling Nissans before. I knew to probably expect an hour of offer/counter offer,  sales-reps scooting back and forth between myself and the sales manager, and at least a modicum of pokerfaced ""who blinks first"". I dug in.
Negotiations lasted exactly 7 minutes, (and that included Sheri bringing us bottles of water). The longest part of the experience was in counting the money - seriously, and yes, some places still gladly accept cash. 
Bottom line - Frank Kent is not the ordinary Used Car Dealership, and Sheri Ballard will receive my referrals and future business.",4.8

They were extremely apathetic when i took my car in, and honestly, they did not want me to leave my car there. Then, when they discovered problems with my car, they refused to give me a car to drive. I HAVE THAT COVERAGE, and my warranty would pay for it! He suggested I go to the local car rental place, and then submit my receipts to my warranty holder, and be reimbursed! This is unheard of in the service world. I WILL NEVER BRING MY CAR BACK HERE!!! The lack of sympathy, and desire to help is astonishing!",1.8

When it came time to sign the papers with finance it was a horrible experience. The man (I can't remember his name) was rude, hardly said a word to us, and gave the overall impression we were an inconvenience. He threw all our papers in an envelope and didn't even make sure everything was signed. We had to return multiple times to sign different forms. Overall after we agreed to buy the car it seemed that we were in everyone's way. I have told multiple people not to buy from there. We have bought many cars over the years and this was by far the worst experience we have ever had.",1.8

Never got through until next day when I was told I should take my car to Vandergriff Hyundai to avoid paying a deductible. In other words, they kept my car a day and a half to tell me that I needed to take it elsewhere. Phoned a week later to ask if they would honor a coupon I received from them in the mail. Guy on phone wasn't sure and didn't offer to find out. I then asked for a price on turning my brake rotors. He said he didn't know and again, did not offer to find out. If the service desk people are this incompetent then how can anyone trust the actual service being performed? I suggest the service manager take a used car from the lot and drive over to Vandergriff and just observe what happens in their service department. Vandergriff has the best I've ever experienced and I will never take my car back to Manuel Hyundai even though it's 10 miles closer.",2.8

I knew exactly what I wanted. Georgiana gave us the best price by several hundred dollars and even threw in free window tinting.

When I arrived to sign the paperwork, I was expecting to be hustled a bit, but it was surprisingly straight-forward. I was in and out of there in no time. Since they didn't have the color car I wanted they had to arrange to get it from another dealer and I picked it up the next day.

The next day I picked up the car and everything went very smoothly. There were no surprises, hidden upsells or pressure. They did everything they said they would and more. I didn't feel at all like what I thought a car sales transaction would be like--more like simply a friendly transaction between two regular people.

I live along way from where i was going car hunting and thats why i wanted the price up front, but almost every dealer wanted me to come in and wouldn't give me a price on a new car.  Then i got an email from dan defrank at manuel hyundai.  He told me his best price he could do on what i was looking for and asked when i could come see the car.  I told him it would be early as i didn't want to spend the whole day car shopping.  He came in to work early before his schedulded time just to meet with us.  He knew everything about the car and was never pushy or impolite.  I was prepared for a long game of cat and mouse but none of that happened. I told him i had my credit report and what financing i wanted and he was able to get everything approved with no problems, and no running back  and forth to his manager.  We then wanted to look at some other sonatas because with the great finanincing we got we could get a little more car if the price was right.  Well not only was it right, it was a fantastic price on a limited sonata.  We also had a veracruz that we wanted to trade in and he had no problem with that either and gave us a great value on our trade.  Dan has made me and my wife customers of him for life!!!!

turn of the computer and get in your boring old car and get yourself to Manuel Hyundai and drive a 2.0T.

I drive 30 miles one way to work in a truck & was debating trading the 10 yr old truck for an SUV large enough to haul a horse trailer, or buying a high fuel mileage smaller car and keeping the truck for farm use.  After much searching on line, I requested dealer price quotes on the 2001 pre-owned Hyundai Elanatra & Sonata thru Edmunds.com. I received immediate responses from three dealerships, all of which seemed eager to meet with me.  Two of the sales responses were what I consider typical - ""Come on in.  We're ready to deal and can get you in a car today!"" Not an approach I find attractive.  The third response was from Dan DeFrank at Manuel Auto.  Dan listened to my story and offered CONSTRUCTIVE suggestions that showed me he truly wanted to help me arrive at the most appropriate solution FOR ME.

Dan sifted thru several vehicles available at Manuel Auto and, after many emails back & forth, I went to the dealership & drove several cars.  Dan took a great deal of time helping me learn about each one and about the different deals available - new vs used, car vs SUV, etc.  I was able, finally to make a decision and purchased a new 2011 Hyundai Sonata at an EXTREMELY fair price with very competitive financing.

His first question to us was how much of a monthly payment we needed and he got us a lower one than we were expecting.  Dan will do what ever it takes to take care of his customers.  We will follow Dan wherever he goes!!!,5.0
308,"April 19, 2011","To begin with, I can not say enough good things about Dan Defrank.  I have bought many new cars in my life and this one is for my daughter (College car).  I don't need to tell you, but with the demand on Elantra's, I have had horrible experiences tracking one down that had the features we were looking for (Limited, Pearl White).  

However, from the initial conversations with Dan, he was very professional, understanding and most of all, VERY helpful.  As I mentioned above, I have bought many cars in my day and this was one of the (if not the) smoothest transactions I have ever done.

If there is anyone I know looking for a car in this class, you can be assured I will be sending them to Dan DeFrank.  If all car sales transactions were this smooth, the entire population would be buying cars much more frequently.  It is the ""Pain in the Ass"" factor that people resist and with people like Dan, that is eliminated.

My ex-wife and I both may be seeking new cars in the near future and the Sonata (turbo) is of interest to me.  I assure you if I do in fact go that route, I will be contacting Dan.  I will say however, I will need to get a little better deal (off sticker) than I did on the Elantra :).

I want to thank Dan one last time for all the effort he put into this sale.  I'm sure they could have sold that car with a lot less effort, but his willingness to help and make my daughters day was greatly appreciated.

Regards,

310,"April 17, 2011","Dan DeFrank was a joy and relief.  He was a relief from the high pressure sales techniques of some of the salesmen encountered at other dealerships and joy because of all his detailed information. I was interested in buying the sonata.  Dan patiently detailed the differences between the GLS, the SE and the Limited.  Then we test drove them back to back.  After quite a few hours, I walked away to consider the differences and make my choice.  Dan let me know that no matter what my choice, he would do his utmost to obtain the car from another dealership if they didn't have it on the lot and to work with me on the price.  After my purchase, Dan spent more time going over all the features of the car and manuals.  This is in contrast to previous new car purchases in which I've driven off the lot not knowing how to pop the hood or open the trunk.  I heartily recommend him, and consequently, Manuel's.",5.0
311,"April 15, 2011",It was no work for me at all. I had visited several other dearlerships and it was a huge hassel waiting in a office for hours and then told to go home and wait for a call which never came . Dan always returned my calls and since this was my first new car I think he may have a customer for life ! I will recommend Dan and the Manuel dealership to everyone! Jeff in finance was great also!,5.0
312,"April 12, 2011","We purchased a 2011 Hyundai Sonata last year from Dan when he was at a different dealership.  We went back to that same dealership in hopes of purchasing another new car from him only to find that Dan was no longer there.  After we went through the ""normal"" dealership crap...we left very disappointed in how much that dealership had changed.
   
Knowing how well we were treated before with Dan, we went searching for him on the internet.  We found him at Manuel Hyundai in Ft. Worth.  We live in Mesquite, TX and Manuel Hyundai is in Ft. Worth, TX.  Based on past experience with Dan we felt the drive would be well worth it.
  
Dan did not let us down.  He was so great to work with.  He was not pushy and just gave us the information we needed to make a very informed decision about purchasing a car.  His professionalism was great just like last time.  He didn’t try to force us to do anything that we didn’t want to do.  We purchased a 2011 Hyundai Elantra from Dan and are so glad we made the drive.

If you are looking for a new car, Dan is the man!  Check him...you will be glad you did.

314,"April 06, 2011","We had an excellent experience at Manuel Hyundai!  This is a smaller, laid-back dealership.  Dan DeFrank sold us our car.  He was straightforward, thorough, and very helpful.  Everyone at Manuel Hyundai went out of their way to accommodate us - Dan even offered to bring our credit apps to the car for us to fill out so my toddler, who had dozed off in the backseat, could catch a nap.  We shopped around for weeks before buying, and I highly recommend Manuel Hyundai.",5.0
315,"March 29, 2011",I had done my research on KBB before calling in. I was able to go over detailed pricing with Dan during our first phone conversation. When I got to the dealership I was ready to purchase the car.  The whole process was hassle free and speedy. Dan was very helpful in the whole process.  He also was very helpful in sending me the necessary forms in advance to sell my old car. This enabled me to sell my old car and buy my new one in the same day. ,5.0

317,"March 28, 2011",Dan DeFrank listened to everything that concerned us and addressed each one with professional and personal concern. He knows his cars. He knows how to listen. He knows how to match you with a car that fits you like a glove in every way possible -- from mechanical to financial to emotional.,5.0
318,"March 17, 2011",Dan worked with me over several days so I could get the car I wanted.  There was never any pressure to buy.  He worked with me and didn't push me in any direction or to make a decision before I was ready.  He investigated numerous options - even cars located at other dealerships.  I would recommend Dan to anyone.,5.0
319,"March 17, 2011","Much better experience here than at some of the other Hyundai dealerships I dealt with in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. Pricing was on par with what I expected from online research. There were no ""dealer installed options"" that were unwanted and not asked for. In my experience some dealers will advertise a price for a car but when you get there to look at it they've added after market wheels or something and jacked the price right back up to what you didn't want to pay in the first place. Overall Manuel has given me a straightforward no bs shopping experience. This was the second car I've bought from them. I have recommended them to friends and family in the past and will continue to do so. Keep up the good work Manuel and don't try to be like some other dealerships who shall remain nameless on I20 in Arlington, cough, excuse me. ",5.0
320,"March 12, 2011",The best experience ever! Dan DeFrank made my purchase a walk in the park and I am a picky buyer.I traded my Honda Fit for an Elantra. WOW no comparison. Fit got 32 mpg hwy and struggled. Elantra get 39 mpg and rides like a dream. Dan made me a great deal and goes the extra mile to help the customer. Something I see less and less of.,5.0
321,"March 09, 2011","I had a great experience at Manuel Hyundai with their salesman Dan DeFrank. He was very knowledgable about the vehicle and let my son and I take it for a test drive without him. Nowdays most salespeople never leave your side, it was very refreshing to be trusted and left to make the decision on my own. I got what I wanted for the price I was looking for in a very timely manner. There was no pressure to buy extended warranties or any extra insurances. I was told what was available and my decision was taken without question. I'm very happy with my purchase and will definitely look at Manuel for future purchases.",5.0
322,"March 07, 2011",Dan was wonderful. He went way over to help me not only in buying this car but helping me figure out insurance.  He explained many things about the Sonata that I didnt know. My move to Dallas was hard but Dan made it much better-I would come back again.,4.8

I picked up my new car after work.  Love the car!  Total time spent during lunch and after work was less than 1 1/2 hours.  Dan was straight forward, on the level, and has my recommendation if you are looking for a car.",5.0

326,"January 23, 2011","My husband and I have been to a few dealerships in the last two weeks and we finally found Manuel Auto dealership off the, I-30 freeway to be the best, by far! I first contacted them on the phone and asked a lot of questions. One of their salesman, Dan Defrank was so patient with me, I never felt like he was rushing me to get off the phone. He answered all my questions. When we went into the dealership to see him he was just as nice, I never felt pressured at any time. Again in person he answered all the questions my husband and I asked him. He knew every aspect of the car. I have never in my life have come across anyone that was so polite as he was. He knew exactly want we wanted. We never at any time felt pressured into buying a car. He was extremely patient with us. I never felt rushed. The finance person Jeffrey was just as nice, he also took his time with us and worked with us to find the best financing for us that we could afford.  I have never been anywhere before that I felt like we were royalty.  I plan on telling anybody I know that they should go to Manuel Hyundai dealership off the I-30 freeway, in Fort Worth, TX. If we every need service for our new car, or if we buy another car in the future my husband and I plan on going back to them and I will ask for Dan Defrank. He is the best!",5.0
327,"January 20, 2011","I purchased a new 2011 Hyundai Sonata SE 2.0 T just before Christmas.  I did most of the deal using the internet and phone.  My salesman was Dan Defrank. Dan was extremely helpful in guiding me in choosing the absolute best car for my needs.  Dan was not pushy and allowed me to drive several different cars.  The Sonata SE 2.0 T is a pleasure to drive.  I am not an aggressive driver and get excellent gas mileage.  The extra power is available any time I want or need it.  I have owned many cars which were more expensive, but none as pleasurable to drive. 
 
Thank you Dan.

330,"January 11, 2011","Don’t buy from Dan if you enjoy haggling over price.  Dan will give you the best deal up front and you can take it or leave it.  

I took it.  Dan offered me a fantastic unbelievable price on the car of my dreams, the Hyundai Santa Fe AWD at the price of a FWD or even lower.  It was even the color I wanted.

When I stupidly forgot my proof of insurance Dan let me use his computer and phone to contact my insurance company and bring one up online. 

Dan then went over the features of the car thoroughly, even though this was a Friday night and he was working late. 

Dan got me a fair value for my trade as well.  

I highly recommend Dan Defrank and Manuel Auto Group.

331,"December 31, 2010","All of my business with Manuel Hyundai was over the computer. After we came to an agreement on a price of a 2011 Sonata GLS I took over my used car and had it appraised by them. Two days later I was signing the paperwork and driving home with the car I wanted. 
 Thanks to Jared, Georgiana, Joe, and Jeffery for making this one of the very few good experiences I can say I have had at a dealership. I will recommend you to all my friends and family.

332,"December 16, 2010","I was having a bit of difficulty in finding the specific car I was looking for in my first choice of colors & options, a 2011 Sonata Limited 2.0 Turbo w/navigation in Pearl White. Unfortunately, there was a limited inventory of cars with the exact package I wanted. As a result, I decided to opt for my second choice in Pacific Blue. 

I located a car at Manuel Hyundai in Fort Worth. Georgiana received my inquiry and promptly gave me quote that was among the best I had received for the car. After undergoing more haggling than I desired with competing dealers, Georgiana was upfront with me & gave me a no haggle price that was to my liking-which was particularly important to me since I was driving 4 hours to shop for this car. No fuss. No back & forth. Just an open door that essentially said, 

""Here's your no nonsense price and come get your car.""

Sometimes working with car dealers can be a chore, but Georgiana and the folks at Manuel Hyundai did everything in their power to put me at ease and made the car buying experience a snap. I was pleasantly surprised with the buying experience at Manuel Hyundai and I would definitely take my business back there.",5.0
333,"November 24, 2010","I had been looking for a reliable commuter car/road tripper with lots of cargo room for my wife and I. We compared Honda Fit, Toyota Matrix, and the Hyundai Elantra Touring. The Touring wins hands down! Price, standard features, all of it! I did all of my communication through email. This is the way to go! You aren't pressured in any office to ""buy today"". You are told the deal in writing and can research it before you ever hit the dealership. I spent very little actual time at the dealer. Dan Defrank, the internet salesperson took great care of me and communication was very quick! He located the car I wanted (it is pretty rare), and got me a price I was definitely happy with! With all the bad apples out there in the car business, it was a pleasure to work with someone I felt I could actually trust! I totally recommend Manuel Hyundai and their internet guy Dan Defrank. It really was a great way to go about buying a car. He called a few days after purchase to see how everything was working out and to not hesitate to come on by if anything is wrong. The one small issue is not something that could have been foreseen by anyone. While waxing the car, I realized the paint job on one small lower section isn't smooth. Just a small production error that they're aware of and will remedy when I bring it back in after Thanksgiving. I'll update the review after a while as I have more experience with the ""service center"", but the sale was really low pressure and great!!!",5.0
