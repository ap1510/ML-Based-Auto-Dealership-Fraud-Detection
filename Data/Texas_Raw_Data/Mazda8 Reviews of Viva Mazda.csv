0,"March 13, 2017","I had a wonderful experience from the beginning, when  purchasing the my mazda 6. I have to recognize sales representative, Mr. Lorenzo Maldonado. He did a wonderful job in presenting the vehicles. He did not pressure or attempt to haggle me. He let me take my time and answered all my questions. I also have to give kudos to their entire staff. They make you feel as tho they are here to sincerely help you, the customer. In addition, their finance manager was thorough in explaining all the paperwork. Their service department employees are very welcoming, helpful, and professional. Finally, they have a very modern and comfortable waiting area with snacks and free beverages! Wow! What more could one ask for. I just had to mention, my vehicle has the best 5 star crash rating among other sedans in it's category.I did my research. :o)

1,"September 17, 2013","Rudolph Mazda East is the best place to go if you are looking for a bad deal. It has now been a year since I have purchased my car and I found out this weekend that have messed up yet again. 
-started out by buying an RX-8 
-as soon as I drove off the lot check engine light came on 
-asked them to fix it 
-after the initial issue I dealt with the manager Mike Rosebeary 
-I got the run around for about a month 
-each time they inspected the car they assured me it was ""fixed"" and the check engine light would come on the next morning 
-the dealer went so far as to say that he would put his family in this vehicle (I feel bad for the dealers family) 
-again and again the mechanics could not figure out the issue all while pressuring me as much as they could to keep that car 
-finally after a month of listening to them lie to me they agreed to switch the car for something else 
-by this time it was too late to cancel my loan at the bank -the car that was exchanged was not a bad car and I like it (Mazda 3) 
-I thought it would end there 
-this weekend rolls around and a park ranger runs my plates and tells me they are canceled 
-of course the plates came from the dealership. 
-They gave me the license plates for the car which I no longer owned (RX-8) 
-fortunately I got off with a warning on the plates 
Never have I had a worse experience shopping. I went to this dealership because a friend recommended them to me. I will never buy from a Rudolph dealership ever again and I will make sure people know the type of treatment to expect from this company. I also feel bad for whoever ended up the the 06' Black RX-8. It would be wise to pick another dealership and they are not looking out for the customers best interest.",1.0

4,"December 07, 2011",I just purchased a CX-9 Grand Touring.  I requested a quote from the dealer website and Mike  had a really quick response.  He help me get the price I want and gave a great presentation of the CX-9 and a test drive.  I was very please with his service as well as other friendly staff members at Rudolph Mazda.  Not only was the experience great but everything went smoothly and quickly.  I would really recommend Mike and Luis.  I hope to purchase more from them in the future. ,5.0
5,"December 06, 2011","I have purchased four vehicles in the last seven years, and this was by far the best experience I have had purchasing a vehicle.  Mike Rosebeary(Internet Mgr)is friendly, knowledgeable, and all around great to do business with.   I highly recommend Mike and everyone at Rudolph Mazda.  The Rudolph family has definitely won me over and I will remain a loyal customer.",5.0
