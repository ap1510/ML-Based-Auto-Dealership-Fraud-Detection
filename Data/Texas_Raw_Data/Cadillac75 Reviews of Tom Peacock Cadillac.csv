0,"June 23, 2020","My deceased husband and I have been Tom Peacock Cadillac service customers for approximately 15 years, and we bought our new 2014 Cadillac CTS there, where we continued to have it serviced. On May 18, 2020, I brought my car in for service and liked the loaner car I was assigned. Immediately I started talking to the sales department about purchasing a car like their rental I was driving. Tom Peacock Cadillac has made my life a living nightmare for over four weeks with their unscrupulous sales practices. 

I have filed a formal complaint with the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles, and they are reviewing my complaint now. I just happened to come across this wonderful State agency. Their number is 1-888-368-4689. They will send a link to the dealership complaint form. 

I made my purchase at Bayway Cadillac, on the east side of I-45 near Costco in The Woodlands, where I got more for my trades (I had two--my husband's truck and my car), a new Cadillac with better features, a better warranty, and saved more than $6,000 over the life of my loan. The Bayway sales staff are kind and have shown they truly care about me. I am a 75-year-old widow with a doctor-prescribed service dog, because I have PTSD and MDD (major depressive disorder) following the horrific events surrounding the sudden and unexpected death of my husband.  

I will NEVER spend another cent at Tom Peacock Cadillac where I feel I have been taken advantage of, abused, harassed, and treated disrespectfully. When this mess started over four weeks ago, I let my guard down because I thought I had friends there. I was sadly mistaken. I would give them zero stars if i had the option.",1.0
1,"May 21, 2020","Buy any car from this dealership with confidence. I bought Preowned SRX three months ago. Ran in to some problems and ""used"" car salesman Dana and his supervisor Thomas were of NO help or can I say ""useless""? They don't return calls and gave me run around for THREE months. So if you want to buy preowned vehicle, stay away from these two.

However, you can absolutely trust Steven, the GM of Tom Peacock. He took care of my problem in ten minutes and he was very pleasant too. I would recommend this place with confidence except those two bad apples in Toms barrel of employees.",3.4

3,"March 01, 2020","I recently upgraded from my SRX to the fabulous XT5. I was very reluctant to do so but the warranty was up on my SRX so I had to decide if I was going to stick with the SRX for the long haul or get a new vehicle that would be under warranty. My salesman, Tommy Simon, was the best at helping me make the best decision for me and my lifestyle. Never once did he pressure me. He just presented me with all the facts so I could make an informed decision. He was very patient and answered all my questions and being the thorough detailed woman that I am, I had a lot of questions. At one point he even provided one of the managers for me talk to help me make the best decision. This is the fourth car my husband and I have bought from Tommy and we keep coming back to Tom Peacock because of Tommy He is honest, trust worthy, patient and an overall nice guy. We trust him with major financial decisions such as purchasing a vehicle. I highly recommend him to anyone. Tommy will be up front with you and tell it like it is. He will go to bat for you and there are no high pressure sales techniques with Tommy. Check him out today!",5.0

5,"December 13, 2019","I just purchase a new SUV from Tom Peacock Cadillac.  This vehicle is my first Cadillac.  Buying a new vehicle can be quite stressfull, but the experience was made stress free by the salesman, Boris Ackerman. Boris was very informative and knows the product he sells.  All the other staff I interacted with during my visit and the buying process, were very pleasant.  I am a satisfied customer.

6,"September 01, 2019","I just bought a 2009 Cadillac XLR from here. I own one already so I know what common problems to ask about. I had to buy it sight unseen due to the distance. This car I understand is a used car (56,600 miles), but I am very upset because all of the expensive issues with the car were problems I specifically asked about, it is obvious that it was an out right misrepresentation and leaving bad reviews all over the internet is my only recourse. When I got the car delivered it was raining so when I finally had a chance to try the top it doesn’t work (I asked about this). The leather on the dash has shrunk and looks really bad (I have a text where the sales person said it looked great). The windshield has 2 un repaired cracks, the driver seat doesn’t go up or down. Who ever worked on the seat just didn’t bother to put it back together. Jenifer the sales person was nice, I even sent her a letter and a gift card. I was willing to overlook everything even the leather, but not the top. It is potentially thousands of dollars to get this car back in order. Even if I wanted to just sell it I won’t be able to do so. I understand this is as is sale, but such  obvious out right lying is unacceptable, and I hope this review saves someone else",1.0
7,"June 26, 2019","Went into the Dealership with my Tired Out 2010 SRX good car but it was starting to have issues I had just left Tom Peacock Nissan who at the time were running a deal , I had spent 2 days on the phone with a salesman at Tom Peacock Nissan  working on the deal , I thought we had the deal locked in on A Altima trade in was appraised credit approved just needed to bring in my SRX so they could make sure it was what I said it was , once I arrived they started really downplaying the value of my trade in I  was passed around to 4 different Salesmen and (  FOR PEOPLE WHO KNOW ME THIS IS A BIG NO NO I WILL WALK EVERY TIME )  so already frustrated to say it politely , I went to Tom Peacock Cadillac ( I KNOW SAME FAIMLY, HANG WITH ME )  to the service department just to get a New key programmed ( PRO TIP, CADILLAC KEYS ARE NOT WATERPROOF LOL ) Told my Story about Tom Peacock Nissan to the Service Manager , I really wish I could remember his name so i could give him credit as well sorry bud , He asked me why i was not trying to buy another Cadillac I told him that I had not thought about it because I was price shopping dealers for trade in and did not see any special offers, so he asked if I wanted to speak to one of his sales men while I waited on my Key, I told him I was  Not in the mood to speak to another salesman that day but that I would but only while I waited on the key, He introduced me to my Man, Arber Neziri Right out of the gate he was straight up and honest, I worked with only him the whole through the whole experience , I told him where I needed to be as far as payments and Arbor with the assistance of Ben worked his A#% off to make it happen and they did take some time to get it done , but the whole time I feel I was treated the same as if I had walked in with a bag of cash looking to buy so on Saturday I walked out with my 2019 XT5 LOVE THIS CAR  I could go on but i cannot say enough about this Dealership and Arber but i wont , I’m going to leave it with this final note , If you’re looking for a new car and you don’t go into Tom Peacock Cadillac ( NOT NISSON ) And at least give Arber a shot at getting you what you want at the price your looking for while giving you the full 5 star service then you are short changing yourself",5.0
8,"April 27, 2019","On 4/25/19 I was in urgent need of roadside assistance. My location was approximately 26 miles from Tom Peacock. Garth Guy arrived in record time. He diagnosed and resolved issue, again, in record time. Garth is professional, courteous, respectful, extremely knowledgeable and skilled. Service after the sale is just as important as the sale. Gary is a great representation /representative of that service and of Tom Peacock. Thanks Garth!!",4.8
9,"April 15, 2019","I am ruined!  I can never buy from any other dealership.  I will only buy from Tom Peacock Cadillac!  We’ve purchased 3 Cadillac’s from Tom Peacock Houston in the past 10 years we’ve lived here.  I have been completely spoiled and can never go back to anyone else!  The sales department is great to work with but what really sells the car to me is the service department!  Yes!  You read that correctly!  I am a busy woman and I appreciate a high end service department!!  We have owned several BMW’s and other luxury brand cars but none of the service departments in town compare to Darrell McCormick at the Tom Peacock Service center in Houston.  I have had issues with so many service departments and we have 2 daughters that share a BMW and I regret that purchase because dealing with The Woodlands BMW sales and service departments has been a negative experience.  I live in The Woodlands and Darrell, from the Cadillac Service department, will send someone to me wherever I am to switch out my car with a beautiful loaner Cadillac while the service is performed on my car.  Within no time , I receive a call from Darrell letting me know the status of my vehicle.  When my car is ready it is washed and returned to me wherever I am.  I pay for the service over the phone (the loaner cars are free!) and rarely have to drive to the service center.  I should mention that the service center waiting area is very nice.  They even have a quiet area for readers, etc.  they have complimentary food and drinks and the one time I had to go up there everyone was very nice and they worked on my vehicle quickly.  I prefer to have my car services done by going on the app to schedule an appointment with Darrell.  Darrell can see the status of my oil life as well as several other features due to the technology of advanced algorithm and on board computer system.  If I do need to call and leave a message however, he is prompt to return my call.  He has always been a gentleman and I’ve never had that “you’re dumb about car’s” feeling that I get from other service people in the past.  Darrell is so respectful, professional and genuinely kind.  The service is always done properly and I have grown to trust this service department completely because Darrell is so honest.",5.0

12,"January 20, 2019","The purchase was great  all the way around including the interaction with Mr. Asher (Finance). Mr. Powers was very courteous ,thorough and understanding of price-point etc.  He followed up with me after purchasing the car although I have indicated  will need to come in for assistance with On-Star & noticed that telephone  does not sync well at all!! Mr. Powers cheerfully agreed for me to come in & would ensure that entire process with On-Star & Que System(Telephone) is done properly!   ",4.8
13,"December 23, 2018","We were looking to purchase a new Cadillac and saw were Peacock was advertising some demos at a good discount. Advertising was on line, on Tv and posted on each car. We met with our salesman (TKeya) who was informative and to be honest we feel like she was kept in the dark about the scam. She said that the dealership was able to offer this car at the advertised price because they had allowed customers to qualify for all the incentives rather they qualified or not.  We test drove the ATS for a couple days and was ready to make our purchase. I was preappoved for my loan but when it came time to sign our papers, the price of the vehicle had increased by over $10,000 including our trade in. We were advised that we could get the incentives. Approximately 6 phone calls of jumbling around numbers and scammy financing deals and we walked , RAN away from the purchase. I am 59 years old and have purchased 15+ new cars and this place is the worst! Lots of older folks looking at cars while I was there, makes you wonder what there doing to those folks. Horrible don’t buy a car here, DOUBLE CHECK YOUR PAPERWORK BEFORE SIGNING ",1.0
14,"November 14, 2018","Jane Doe from Houston, Tx | November 12, 2018
I recently took my car to Tom Peacock for repairs. I was hearing a noise but I was thinking it was part of the problem at hand because when they diagnosed it they heard it too. After the repairs, I still continued to hear the noise. Being discusted with the dealer I went to another mechanic shop and they heard the noise immediately and discovered it was a leak in the steering system. I want to remind you, Cadillac test drove my car after the repairs, heard the noise and ignored the noise. This is unacceptable to me and clearly shows that the repairmen are not interested in any other noises they hear. It seems the repair department is over booked and don’t t give the necessary attention to card being serviced.",2.4
15,"October 23, 2018","Since moving to  Texas 18 years ago we have bought several cars. All of them through Tommy Simon at Peacock Cadillac. We had referred other people including family members also to deal with Tom Simon. They, and we, have been thrilled with his service, his consideration, and attention to details. Anytime we have had a problem Tommy has arisen to the occasion. We will continue to be not only a customer but a friend to Tommy.  ",5.0

17,"May 11, 2018","I recently purchased a car from Tom Peacock. Beautiful dealership with great employees. Tommy Simon is without a doubt the BEST salesman I have ever dealt with. He really listened and took care of everything including programming my car perfectly before I took delivery. In addition, I was shown the service department so i will know where to go when I need an oil change.

20,"January 20, 2018","My wife and I had the best experience we have ever encountered at a dealership today Tom Peacock Cadillac. KT Ahmed was a Great sales consultant.  My wife told him what she wanted, the range she wanted her payments to stay. She drove away in what she wanted. Need I say more. Great job KT.

Turns out the car we traded in and was allowed $23,000 for trade in is now on the lot for sale with a sticker price of $29,998. My wife is furious. We understand everyone is in business to make money but she feels she was really taken advantage of. Nothing we can do now. We will not refer any one there or buy another vehicle from them.",5.0

Thanks to Tommy, I am now a proud owner of a new Cadillac XT5.",5.0
31,"December 02, 2017",I have had more than one issue. The most recent is being old by a service advisor to take my car somewhere else as they cannot give me a loaner. When I bought the car I was told I could always get a loaner for service. I have not had an issue with getting one until today when I was told I must have an appointment and I should go somewhere else because they could not service my car. The service writer walked away from my car in the middle of the conversation and one of the sales managers laughed at me when I called to dealership. This is what Cadillac service looks like I guess. Very disappointed. ,1.0

33,"November 29, 2017","My sister and I went to Tom Peacock looking for a used Cadillac.  As none of the vehicles matched our expectations, we almost left.  BUT -- while looking for a color chart, we met Freddie and discussed what we had in mind.  He told us he could put us in a ""new"" vehicle that would be exactly what we wanted.  Yeah - UnHuh - Sure.
We went home never expecting to hear from him again.  Almost immediately my phone rang and it was Freddie saying he had found exactly the color combinations we were looking for.  So we agreed to meet the next morning to look at what he had available.
Long story short, we drove out with our 2018 XT5 Cadillac and want to highly recommend Freddie and Tom Peacock in general.  As this was our second purchase with them, we already knew that their service is excellent.

I was connected to Leonard Young, Internet Sales Specialist, who graciously offered his assistance that very day. When I arrived he asked me what features I wanted in a vehicle  and then showed me both 2016 SRX and 2017 XT5 and provided me with comparative information on both vehicles. My time was limited that day so I test drove only the XT5  and Mr. Young was very helpful in providing me with information about the vehicle. I returned the following day with my wife and, with Mr. Young's assistance, test drove the 2016 SRX and we later decided to lease an SRX with the features we both wanted.  Mr. Young explained and set up many of the technical features in the SRX for us which was of tremendous help as we had not purchased a new vehicle in over 10 years. He also showed us the dealership's service center and offered his personal assistance whenever we might need it.

55,"December 13, 2014","This dealer is the most unproffesional dealer I have ever dealt with. I went in to try to purchase a used vehicle I saw through their website.  First of all they gave me the run around on saying the price they had online for that vehicle was a mistake, than they tried to tag on a $1,200 ""reconditioning fee"" on top of the negotiated sales price. That is straight up ridiculous!. This is a 2013 car with low miles I was trying to purchase, what makes them think it would cost $1,200 to recondition a vehicle like this. Also, you dont just try to sneak in some additional amount onto the sales price you had already agreed to sell it for and then say oh, is company policy. Let me tell you this is BS and you guys are full of it.  Most reputable dealerships will include their ""reconditioning fee"" on the sales price of their vehicles, bottom line!

57,"November 06, 2014","I visited Tom Peacock Cadillac and my sales person was a man named Richard Bluiett in pre-owned cars department. I was very nervious about taking to the car of my dreams 2010 BMW 550I. But Mr. Richard Bluiett had walk with me all the way through finance to handing over the keys to my new ride. We had a one-on-one review about my car and programming etc. He also talk to me an extended warranty on this type of car. I am happy that I listen to him but most of all I am very happy about my monthly payments and how helpful he was with me and all thousand and one questions that I had that day. Mr. Richard Bluiett you made my experience a great one . I give you all 5 stars in my book. Plus at the hospital where I work , they  all like cadillac's so they will be coming your way pretty soon and asking for you Mr. Richard Bluiett OUTSTANDING SALES GUY.

58,"October 31, 2014",I was unhappy with some of the dealerships in the Houston area and a family friend recommended Richard Bluiett at Tom Peacock Cadillac. He did and awesome job and most of all it was stress free. I would encourage anyone who is in need of a vehicle  and good customer service to go see Richard Bluiett at Tom Peacock.  Although the deal took a couple of days I was patient and Juan was great with me when it was time for me to sign my paperwork. ,5.0
59,"June 30, 2014","I was reminded by the General Manager that this is a Premium Dealership , I guess that means Lie Cheat and Steal , the used Car portion is the worst ever seen ! They ran all the numbers , promised several things never given , I started to leave when another salesman said as is no make ready  , then told all would be repaired. Well do not believe  a word they say , it is all lies . I bought a high priced Junk that had been in an unreported front end collision bad enough for headlights to come on by themselves , front end is shot , My advice is stay away from these cheats , an employee explained , something he did not mean to do but his resume made it online and boy did he tell it right , they add on all sorts of hidden items and after paying for Tax Title and license in cash , it turned up in my payments along with a letter claiming that since I had a freeze put on Experian way back do to ID theft , I found out the 1.9% interest rate I was told I qualified for with a score at 800 with the other 3 created ratings all above 800 or just below , payments jumped from $230 for 36 months up to $285 for 48 months ! I had to refinance and at that time all their affiliates  trying to sell me one thing or another called 7 times knocking my credit scores down , this after receiving a nasty letter from then claiming my credit was not good enough . They lied so many times and the car is Junk , that was a good dealership but not anymore , I am too mad to write , STAY AWAY from Tom Peacock ",1.6
60,"March 09, 2014","The experience with Tom Peacock Cadillac and Rick Anchondo was a nightmare.  I would NOT recommend anyone to go and purchase a vehicle from Tom Peacock a long as Rick Anchondo is the Director of Sales.  Rick is nothing but a typical new car salesman and is condescending towards his customers.  His exact remarks to me as a customer while negotiating a price was ""if you cannot afford a $500 payment, then you don't deserve to drive a Cadillac"".  

He wasted two days for me and when the time came to finally make the deal, he reneged and refused to sell me the car on the terms his salesman and I had been discussing.  

I would sincerely ask everyone to go visit Ron Carter Cadillac and NOT Tom Peacock only because of Rick Anchondo.  Someone at Tom Peacock Cadillac needs to look into his customer dealings, courtesy and service.

61,"November 27, 2013","On 9/5/2013 I purchased a Mercedes 2006 S class for asking price. I could not test drive the car because it was in the service dept. being inspected. My salesman, Chad, told me ""I had better jump on it because it is a great car and has had a number of calls on it""....so I did. I took delivery of the pristine ""looking"" Mercedes the next day, still with no inspection sticker and an empty gas tank. I sent out an email that same day addressing 7 items that needed to be addressed including a loud grinding noise from the engine compartment and a severe overall vibration. I was told by Mike U. the Used Car Manager who, btw, is no longer there, that those noises were because it had 130,000 miles on it. Right!! This is not my only Mercedes Mikey!! When challenged, he said that is what the service manager told him. BOTTOM LINE: Mercedes Benz North did over $6,500.00 worth of life-threatening repairs to the drivetrain, replaced all engine and transmission mounts, tie rods, valve cover gaskets, rear main seal, traverse control arm, front end alignment and replaced the AC compressor. SERIOUS STUFF!  The car was unsafe to drive and should never been sold. When trying to settle with Tom Peacock Cadillac I was denied what was previously promised and told by GM Steve Hainline, per new Used Car Manager Josh Parker, that ""my ship had sailed"" and that I had signed a ""Sold As IS"" Disclosure Agreement. Not even an apology!!  This is far from over.......",1.4
62,"July 12, 2013","WORST Car experience ever.  Not sure about buying a new car, I'm sure they may be better than the Pre-Owned vehicles personnel.  DON'T EVER BUY A PRE-OWNED ANYTHING FROM THIS PLACE.  Came down $500 on price but then when I was signing paper work, I see a ""Dealer Prep"" fee of $299.00.  I was pissed because in other
words, they took off $500 but then added back $300.  I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD TO PAY FOR ""DEALER PRE"" AND ESPECIALLY $300.  All the other dealerships we did
business never charged this and still always filled up with gas and detailed inside and out.  After a lenghty discussion they took it off but when we picked up the black truck,
it had only 1/2 tank of gas and it hadn't been washed.  Finger prints all other and smudges.  No extra key and they say because it is ""as is"". Also, was going to do some
other repairs and never heard back from them.  Horrible, Horrible!!  I will tell everyone I know.  Used Car Manager is very shady.",1.4
63,"July 12, 2013",I was looking to purchase a new car and had visited several dealerships and given the run around. I saw a posting on Facebook for this dealership and a contact person. I went in on July 1 and drove off the same day with a brand new car. LaDonna and Tony in finance were very helpful in closing my deal. I now have a brand new 2013 Cadillac ATS. ,5.0
64,"March 27, 2013","I went in on 03/01/13 to get a part for an friend who owns a CTS. I was approached by LaDonna asking me about the part. I told her the part was for a friend and I did not have a car. LaDonna asked me and my boyfriend for 20 minutes of our time and she guaranteed that she could get me in a car. We filled out the application and waited a few hours and she came back and told us to return the part and call and get some insurance. The deal was for a 2013 CTS. I called and paid for full coverage insurance. We then were sent over to financing to sign paperwork, which is what we did. We were handed keys and we left. As of today we have been to that dealership every week because they are asking for different documents. I found out on 03/23/13 that the deal has not been finalized. I tried calling the finance company and they cannot locate me or my boyfriend. I have been calling the dealership everyday and can't talk to anyone. I do not know what is going on with the deal. Oh! I also gave them $1500 for a down payment, which they have cash the check and it has cleared on my account.",1.2
65,"March 07, 2013","1. Salesperson did not know how to change the dial on the radio let alone bigger user questions.
2. 90 days later and they still have not called about my license plates.  When the first paper ones expired and i went to ask about what to do, they claimed that they had no record of me.
3. Called to set a required Cadillac service appointment.....got a voice mail in service, left a message and never got a return call.
4. A survery from Cadillac asked if the dealer explained various different things about the car including if they've sent a technician to my house to properly install the garage opener.  About 50% of the benefits I had no idea were available/offered.
5. A follow up phone call would have resolved about 80% of the many questions I still have but once they sell you a car, you are on your own.

Buyer beware of Tom Peacock Cadillac.  They are not the ""high end"" dealership that Cadillac dealerships should be.",2.6
66,"February 21, 2013","My name is Haley Gross and I was looking for a VW New Beetle. I searched and searched, I found one at Tom Peacock. When I went to test drive the vehicle the employees were very friendly and willing to help. This was my first vehicle to go and buy with my parents and I felt very welcomed and taken care of. Kt Ahmed was the man who helped me with the vehicle he was very nice and helpful. Then when it was time for all the paper work me and my parents met with Mike Brodeur he was funny and very helpful. He made sure to take care of my parents and I. I enjoyed going there and would recommend it to anyone.",5.0

68,"February 04, 2013","The initial visit is WONDEFUL, but once they make the deal the great service faded away. The finance Manager Josh was very unfriendly. He failed to fully go over my contract at signing. He rushed me through the signing and when I asked him to further explain he did not. There was also a young lady who monitored the snack area, she was very unfriendly. A friend and I asked her to help because the coffee was low. She acted like she did'nt even hear us. then I asked her again and she got this ugly attitude and frowned for no apparent reason. I had to learn about the many benefits my contract offered through the internet.  And thank God for Onstar, they also explained more of the benefits I had. I've gone in several times since my purchase and discovered that customer servic is just poor. I have decided to go to another cadillac dealer for service. I will never refer anyone to this dealership. I would like to add that my salesman was great despite what I experienced with others. ",3.8

From the first point of contact Cornelius went over and beyond the call of duty for a salesman to make this event one where I will definitely recommend him as well as Tom Peacock Cadillac to family and friends!!",5.0
71,"May 12, 2012","I visited your store today at 4:00pm and no one even asks if we needed help, said hello or someone will be with you.  I believe you have a good dealership, but today I wasn't sure.  There was a tall lady talking to the reception desk that looked at us out the conner of her eye, but again never said anything. I told my wife you all was most likely having a bad day...

72,"March 08, 2012","Just leased a CTS for $12,000 and I'm thrilled to pieces with it. I've been driving the same Chevy Cavalier since just out of college, and I'm so excited to have my first luxury car. And to think in a couple of years, when the new has worn off, I can just turn it in and get another one! 

At first I wasn't sure if leasing was a good idea, but after I added up the miles I put on my car, I was better off leasing than buying. George was SOOOOOO patient and helpful, and made everything incredibly easy. See you in 2 years George :)",5.0
73,"March 08, 2012",Bought a certified used CTS - finance sold my wife diability insurance ($1500.00) that was never actiated. Paid car off early - visited dealership for refund - told they would apply it toward principal - never happened - paid car off - approaching one year since purchase - still can't get my money refunded. Lots of promises - not action. Beware of after the sale service - it doesn't exist.,1.0
74,"February 17, 2012","BEWARE!! Tom Peacock is advertising that you can purchase a new fully loaded CTS for $12,000 cash. This advertisement was aired on TV and if you call both the receptionist and sales person, they will tell you there is no catch, that the car is yours for $12,000 cash upfront....BUT THERE IS A CATCH. The $12,000 is a one pay on a lease and you will have to trade in the car after 3 years or pay the full amount of the vehicle's worth (which wasn't disclose to us right away, it require continuing questioning of the salesman on why the dealership was selling CTS for $12,000). The sales person tried to still tell us that this wasn't a ""lease"" but obviously this is a REALLY BIG FALSE ADVERTISEMENT CAMPAIGN. I hope you don't waste your time at this dealership or get duped getting a CTS and find out later that you have to return the car!!
