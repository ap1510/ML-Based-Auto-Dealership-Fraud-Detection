3,"June 08, 2020","After having my vehicle for 6 days, it broke down.  They DID NOT stand behind it   NO SUPPORT. if I could give negative stars I would. Zero concern for my well being when I was broke down on I-10.   I had to use my extended warranty and thank goodness I had it.  A joke.  I would not recommend them to anyone  ",1.0

9,"April 05, 2020","First, the phone system is archaic. You CANNOT reach anyone. Once you get the automated system, if you don’t know the exact extension, you’re instructed to press “0” for operator & are then told operator not available, & are disconnected. 
My claim involved the optional insurance for tires & wheels. Around October 2019, an item fell off of a trailer I was behind, after dark. I swerved & missed hitting it with front tire, but the rear ran over it. Soon after, the tire wouldn’t stay inflated. I took it in, & the tire was immediately replaced. 
Within days, the replaced tire kept losing air pressure. I returned to the dealership to have it looked at. They told me my wheel was bent, & until replaced, wouldn’t maintain a seal. I told them I had the coverage, so they were to begin the claim process. They kept truck while this was happening. After 4-5 days, I returned to check progress. Nothing so far. At this point, I asked them to mount my spare so I could use truck until parts arrived. Great idea!
About (2) weeks later, I received a call asking when I was going to bring truck back in so repairs could be completed. I asked if parts had arrived... “Umm, I’m not sure. What is it we’re doing to it?” I explained, & was assured they’d get right on it. A few days later, I received a call informing me that the insurance representative had told the service writer they declined to cover the repair. I told the service writer that was unacceptable, I’d purchased the policy, & that this was EXACTLY what it covered. I was given the number & told “see if you have any more luck.”
I called the tire/wheel insurance company, gave my claim number, & asked why this wasn’t a covered occurrence. I was told they DID NOT deny the claim, they’d simply requested photos showing the damaged area of wheel (clearly visible to even an untrained eye). It was recommended I return truck to dealer so they could take & submit the pictures. I was able (miracle) to reach someone in service by phone. I was told I could take the photos as easily as they could... 
I took the photos, called the insurance rep back & obtained email address of where to send, & submitted. A few days later, the dealership called & asked if they should close out my ticket. I told them no, & what I’d done to revive progress. I gave the insurance rep’s name & extension so they could contact them, & get approval to order parts. 
This carried on until FEBRUARY... I left message after message with no return calls. Finally, I received a call message that parts were in, & I should call to schedule an appt. I tried & tried, but could never reach anyone. Finally, I drove to dealership, walked in, & spoke to receptionist(s). They pointed out the office of who I needed to speak with. I walked in, sat down & waited. I was told they weren’t taking appts, so it was first come, first serve. I replied, “Well, I’m here. Let’s do this.” 
A couple of hours later, all was repaired & I was on the road. 
I have NEVER had any experience nearing this level of incompetency. Truthfully, however, the service employees were always friendly & polite. I made more allowances than I should’ve along the way as to why things could possibly become so confused. Maybe I should’ve been more demanding? Guess the squeaky wheel really does get the grease...

12,"March 09, 2020","Stacey Mofit is a great serviceadvisor. He listens and explains the process honestly and directly. 
But unfortunately. Due to the repairs were recklessly performed my vehicle was damaged. The repair on my window is awful and they scratched the metal on the inside of my window and didn'tput it back together completely. I have to take it back for more repairs. 
I am praying they will be done and corrected next week.",4.0

14,"January 22, 2020","The check engine light came on on my truck.  I took it to Philpott Motors and they diagnosed it as an issue with the catalytic converter and that it had to be replaced.  I made an appointment for the next week.  They replaced it under warranty and returned it to me the same day.

I have always had superior service from Philpott Motors.  ",5.0
15,"January 18, 2020","I was quite pleased with my salesperson and the vehicle! I would note though that when I was finishing up on the finance end, that the staff not involved, in the front were loud and unruly and made it difficult to discuss some matters on the phone. Management could push for more professionalism while customers are present.",5.0

I was able to pick it up couple of hours later.the battery was replaced at no charge because of warranty. I have always received good results with the service department.,5.0
25,"November 02, 2019",Did a great job with service. Personally I feel that Staff bring more to the company than service. Wonderful people that care. Even though I got stranded the next day on a road trip after getting my truck serviced and checked out. But it was not their fault because the battery had a dead cell. Will not use anyone else but them on my truck.,5.0
26,"October 21, 2019",easy to drop of vehicle ahead of time. They called promptly when they addressed the issue. All parts were not in stock and they had to keep another day. Did not inquire about loaner. Had to book 30 days in advance so don't know why they did not have parts. Repair and workmanship appears very good,4.8

29,"October 08, 2019",I lost two vehicles to Imelda (including my 2017 F250 that was just a baby with about 3500 miles on her. I called my salesman Brunson Ableson and told him what happened. He knew exactly what I wanted even though I hadn't seen him in several months and he remembered me once I told him my name. He located a 2019 version of the same truck within a day. The only hitch was getting two drivers to go pickup the truck over in Louisiana so it was delayed a day. Cory in finance was great to work with too. ,4.8
30,"October 03, 2019",Always excellent service at Philpott! Staff is friendly and service is quick and always done correctly. I will forever recommend this place for service and sales!,5.0

33,"September 25, 2019",I did not buy my Ford truck here but the service was excellent.  Got my oil change and regular service fast and got me back on the road.  The service manager helped me go over some of the features in my truck that I was having issues with.  She was very knowledgeable of the features and the vehicle.  ,5.0
34,"September 04, 2019",I have in the past have all ways set appointments to have my truck service at PhilPott.  This last time I had a 9:30 A.M. appointment that I made a week in advance.  It took them a hour and a half to service.  I feel if someone took the time to set an appointment and shows up to there appointment should be a head of people show up out of the blue.,4.2
35,"September 04, 2019",Very friendly and helpful with having the work done in a timely manner. All the employees were friendly and helpful. Very nice experience would return again,5.0
36,"September 03, 2019","Brought my truck in for a recall...
Stacy Moffett is always a pleasure to do business with.
He’s very thorough and cares about his clients.",5.0
37,"August 31, 2019",Philpott Ford service has always been very reliable. I have always been able to count on getting my vehicle serviced and repaired. Tabitha was extremely helpful with my service questions. The service department is the reason I purchased my F-350 from Philpott Ford. ,5.0
38,"August 27, 2019",I had a 7:00 am appointment for oil change and tire rotation.  At 7:00 am I was checked in.  Was out the door by 8:05 am with all service completed.  I have ALWAYS had excellent service at Philpott Ford.,4.8
39,"July 22, 2019","I had an 8:30am appointment this past Saturday and arrived a little early so I wouldn't miss it.  The advisor told me it would be a wait due to the number of walkins they had, which completely negates the point of having an appointment. I asked him if it even helps to make an appointment and he said sometimes it does and sometimes it doesn't.  That is a horrible policy.  At any other dealership I have ever had maintenance work scheduled for a vehicle they always put appointments first as they should. I finally left between 9:30-9:45 and their service techs left plastic covers on my seat and paper mats on the floor board that I had to remove for them.  When I got halfway down the road my windshield wiper fluid low alert came on because they didn't refill it for me. Isn't that a basic thing that gets done when you do an routine maintenance check?  I didn't have time to go back so I bought some yesterday and did it myself.  They're sloppy and need a better policy in place for people that make appointments.",2.8
40,"July 15, 2019","Tabitha McCray worked very hard with her service department to figure my trucks issues.  She also spent alot of time on the phone with my ""extended warrant"" Ihad purchased trying to explain things to them in an effort to have them pay some of my expenses.  I have never had a bad experience with service department and service advisors at Philpott in Nederland.",4.0
41,"July 14, 2019",Thanks to Ed Marcus for scheduling an appointment the day I called about my F250 check engine light on. He frequently called me about the status on the repairs and the timing for completion. His knowledge of Ford trucks is amazing and reassuring.,5.0
42,"July 08, 2019","I was able to make an appointment the day after I called. My car was in and out while I waited.
Competent and courteous service.",5.0
43,"March 20, 2019","Brunson made this the easiest car buying experience. I went there knowing what I wanted and no one tried to talk me into buying anything different. They answered questions honestly and no game playing on the price. Brunson even found the color I wanted.  I will definitely buy my next vehicle from here !
