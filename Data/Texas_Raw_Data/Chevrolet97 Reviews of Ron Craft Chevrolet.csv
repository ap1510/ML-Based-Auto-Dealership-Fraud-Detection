9,"May 10, 2020","I've always been a person who knows what he wants and it was no different when purchasing a Cadillac. Fortunately for me Alex Rivera was there to listen instead of push other vehicles on me that where no where near in my plans. This made my experience smooth and easy when I communicated that I wanted a sedan, blue, top tier trim (close to it), with reasonable miles if not new. Straight away he directed me to a few options, explained to me in good depth, test drove my top 2 choices, and started signing paperwork within an hour. Simply put he not only sold me a good car but also won my future business when it comes to vehicle purchases. ",4.2

In this day and age, it's not easy to find someone who is passionate about their job especially being a Sales person and Charles Hall was one of the few.

59,"May 25, 2018","My car buying experience at Ron Craft was phenomenal. I am located hours from the dealership, found the car online, and they got everything prepared for me before I got there.  I was able to review the paperwork, look at the car, test drive it, and then sign the papers after I follow through with the purchase.  The team was very helpful and never felt pushy in anyway.  They would answer question, and then stand back so that you could make your own informed decision. I appreciated this mentality. 
I would very much recommend Chris for car buying when you need it next.

60,"May 17, 2018","Having set a 3pm meeting with Ron Williams and getting there only to be told he was running late.

Then being approached by another sales rep trying to act like Ron and not bothering to look at the notes Ron had for our meeting but wanted me to go over everything again we had discussed. A older gentleman came by and asked if all was ok and I stated no and then he told me there is the boss right there....well as I live and breath the other man just turn away and went into what was the command center and did not even want to see what the problem was ???I then asked the rep if he was Ron and he stated no but tell me everything ….to make it short he finely went and looked at his notes  and knew exactly what I was there for and then wanted me to walk out to the lot and look at the car. I was informed  in the meeting the car would be up and waiting for me  in front at 3pm.  He left and brought the car around and it had 22k and not the 10 k I was told ; then I asked for  12.5% off he went and came back saying no deal price stays as is. Well that my review; hope things would have worked out for a sale.",3.0

65,"May 02, 2018",I went to Ron Craft Chevy on a Saturday shopping for a car for my youngest daughter. I was helped by Chris Wright. He showed me the Chevy Cruze model that was in my price range. I also told him I was looking around at other places to see what was out there for the budget I had to work with as well. I told him I would be in touch. I brought my daughter back on Monday. Chris showed her the available colors in the Cruze model I had looked at previously. She test drove it and loved it. I bought it right then and there. Chris took care of my daughter and I. Not once did Chris pressure me either visit. It was the easiest experience buying a car I ever had.,5.0

69,"April 16, 2018"," I had a scheduled appointment with Dalton Sheffield and when I arrived I was met with a very warm smile and a very strong handshake. We sat down for a moment and discussed what I was looking for and the price range and within 10 minutes Dalton drove around a truck and we went for a test drive. He nailed it. The perfect truck for me. I cannot say enough about this young mans mannerisms. I have bought several cars in the past and I must say that this was probably the most professional sales person and the most pleasant purchasing experience. Along on this great adventure I also had my daughter and my two-year-old grandson which after the first 15 minutes was no longer glad to be there. While working the deal  Dalton also entertain the baby and never missed a beat.  One of the things that really stood out to me was the fact that he focused on me as his customer,  but as his only customer he greeted and smile to other people that approached him but he worked my deal I was his priority at that time.  Another thing that I found very awesome was the general manager of the dealership actually come out and greeted me asked me if everything was going OK and was so sincere and making sure that everything was going  smoothly, that was a first for me. I could ramble on about how awesome my experience with Ron craft and as Dalton Sheffield as my sales person but I’m going to sum it  by saying that Ron craft has my business and as long as Dalton Sheffield is selling vehicles I’ll never go anywhere else or buy from anyone else. Ron craft rocks and so does Dalton Sheffield! Thank you Dalton Sheffield and Ron Craft!",5.0

I was on the market for a car and I had my eyes on the corvette, and I asked the salesman that I would like to take a look at the car, a colleague of mine had accompanied me and he asked for test drive. The salesman Chris asked me to look at videos and said the people in the market for a corvette would actual do research and buy the corvette without even taking the test drive, judging by our modest looks and personality. He also tried to cheat and sell some CPO on an already CPO car and was trying his best to fleece from us. Worst part is they make u wait for hours before they even show you the car. Did not even offer us water. We could sense judgement in his speech and the whole dealership was like that.",1.0

84,"September 30, 2013","Purchased a used Cadillac DTS via their internet sales. I was told that and received via fax a clean CARFAX report. I asked additionally if the car had ever been wrecked and if car had any body damage that I should know about. I was told that the car was in ""like new"" condition. After several issues with this disorganized bunch in attempting to close the deal and pay for the vehicle, I finally was able to make a bank transfer and arrange for having the vehicle shipped via a car hauler. When I received the vehicle from the delivering party, I was disappointed to find out that the vehicle had been wrecked and poorly repaired on the right front bumper, the driver's side and the left rear bumper. The repairs were so obvious that I noticed them immediately as well as the did the driver of the car hauler. I called the dealership and spoke to the salesman and he told me that the CARFAX didn't show any repairs and that he actually never saw the vehicle. For the last two months I have attempted to seek a settlement with the dealership, asking each time to speak to the general manager. I have yet to receive a return call from her and was finally told that they would offer $300 for repairs that will cost nearly $2700.

89,"June 21, 2012",Our car buying experience was painless. Our family has bought two cars from Ron Craft and have recommended friends who have also bought from Ron Craft. They are knowledgeable about the cars they sell and will spend time showing you everything about your vehicle. They guide you on making an informed decision on your car purchase without the typical hassle that comes with buying a car. I will buy all my cars from Ron Craft.,5.0
90,"June 21, 2012","RonCraft always goes above and beyond for our family.  We have purchased 3 cars and have recieved exceptional service with each vehicle.  The Salesmen and Managers are courteous, knowledgeable, and patient. Andy was very patient while I made up my mind.  When I finally made a decision, the Manager, Bill even made sure that my visit to the dealership was satisfactory. Buying a car or trading in a vehicle can be a stressful event.  Our trips to Ron Craft were nothing buy pleasent.  I will always recommend Ron Craft. ",5.0
91,"June 21, 2012","What a wonderful experience! I was weary of making the leap on a new vehicle and was more than pleasantly surprised with my experience at this dealership. From the second I walked in the door, I was made to feel like I was their only customer. The process of choosing my vehicle was easy, too. I told them what I was looking for and I was shown several models that met my standards. At the end of my dealings with the finance manager, two of the sales and another lady met me outside at my freshly detailed vehicle and took my photo - about a month later I got a really cool personalized calendar in the mail! Talk about above and beyond! I even had TJ calling me in the weeks and months after my purchase to make sure everything was running perfectly and that I was still happy without the purchase. No doubt that I will return to Ron Craft for my family's next vehicle! ",5.0

93,"June 19, 2012",Awesome!!  Great experience from start to finish.  I love my new Eqinox!! Thank you Fred for answering my many many questions.  Corey was very helpful at finding the best rate and you can't beat $11.95 oil changes for life.  ,5.0
94,"June 13, 2012",Was greeted promptly and offered cold water. Was impressed with trade in value and fair price offered immediately ....no games and I had already done my research. I am a woman and expected to be hassled. I was treated great and better deal than expected. Thank you Ron Craft!!!!!!!,5.0
95,"September 17, 2011","Still waiting for warranty work to be done! Brought my vehicle in aug.24 for oil service & told them then that the dash compartment door would not pop open as it should. The part was suppose to be ordered. called back on sept.2 to find out status of part to be ordered & spoke to paul who took my # & said he would call me back. A female called back & said it would be another couple of days. Sept 12 I went to dealership to find out what the problem was. Spoke to mike isham who assured me that he got the part ordered. Took my vehicle in sept. 14, wrong part was ordered! I don't understand the complications of getting my vehicle fixed! I have been given the run around from day 1. I also told them that my a/c was occasionally not blowing cold air. They still have not checked that!  What is their problem????????",1.3
96,"August 30, 2011","The Finance Manager is a lunatic!  He actually came racing out of the front door screaming at me through the parking lot.  I had to get into my vehicle because I wasn't real sure exactly WHAT he would do next.
He was cocky, arrogant and condescending!  He treated me exactly like how you would expect a dealership to treat a woman...like an idiot.  He, however, proved that he was indeed the idiot.
I've since read horrible reviews on this dealership (and apparently this is typical behavior at this dealership).  The General Manager didn't even feel it necessary to respond to the complaint.  It appears as though this type of behavior is accepted.
