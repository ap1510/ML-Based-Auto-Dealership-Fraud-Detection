2,"November 02, 2018","Brought my new Tundra in for its first free tire rotation, a part of the ToyotaCare program provided with new vehicle purchase. I called Stewart Toyota yesterday to make an appointment for my first 5k tire rotation per the ToyotaCare program. I asked if I needed to make an appointment for this and was told it’s best to make an appointment so you don’t have a long wait. I let them decide the best time to bring my truck in for rotation and was givien a 10:45 am appointment time. I arrived at 10:35am and dropped off my truck. An hour and 30 minutes later I got my truck back. They said “sorry for the wait”
They not only let me down they let the ToyotaCare program down. I can’t trust them for any future ToyotaCare program promises. They don’t keep theirs!",2.2
3,"April 03, 2018","If I could rate this dealership with anything less than 1 star I most definitely would! After Harvey hit Houston we of course needed a new vehicle. Being skeptical about buying from a dealer in Houston, we headed towards Dallas and stopped here where we bought a 2015 Dodge journey from Kristen. She constantly bragged about the dealerships integrity and how they were a family owned dealership in a small town so their reputation meant everything. After guaranteeing nothing was wrong with the vehicle, we purchased it. In the 6 months we have had it, it has been in the shop 4 times so we decided to trade it in. Upon doing so we found out from other dealerships that the car had been in an accident from the previous owner and resulted in a bad Carfax so the value of the vehicle depreciated a significant amount which put us way upside down. Not only did they sale us a terrible vehicle but when I called the dealership to see if they could help us in any way, I spoke to a salesman named Todd that was extremely rude and disrespectful! He resulted in telling me at first that they didn't know that the car had a bad Carfax then tried covering his lie by explaining that ""legally, we don't have to disclose that information."" After I let him know that I was disappointed in his reaction and response as a customer and that I would be leaving reviews to warn possible future customers,he recommended that I call back to speak with a manager. It's a shame that not even the manager has enough common decency to call back to discuss the situation we are concerned about that involves the dealership he runs. So much for integrity, this dealership is just bad business all the way around!",1.0

5,"April 26, 2017","This is the 10th car we have purchased from this dealership in the last 15 years.  We have always felt that we received a good deal and personalized service each time.  It is understood that salesmen move on to other jobs, but the leadership and commitment is still there.  Highly recommended this dealership.",5.0

7,"August 07, 2015","My wife and I were traveling back to Houston and experienced a growling noise in our right front wheel assembly. We were fortunately near Stewart Toyota in Corsicana, TX. The service representative, Terry Keeton, met us as soon as we pulled in to explain our situation. The service group took the Highlander in and checked the vehicle for the problem. The noise had quit by the time we got to the dealer, but the completely inspected the vehicle to insure that we did not have a problem. We did not have an issue. A rock or some obstruction had evidently lodged in the wheel assembly somewhere and caused the noise. Stewart did the inspection quickly and did not even charge us for the service. This type of Toyota representative is why we only buy Toyota cars. Thank you Stewart and Toyota.
