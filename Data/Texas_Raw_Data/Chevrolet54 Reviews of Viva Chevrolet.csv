When I had an issue with GM financial, Viva said they‚Äôre not GM and GM says it‚Äôs the dealership‚Äôs issue. Viva finance managers will lie to close the deal! Do not buy from them! You‚Äôll be sorry if you do! ",1.0

3,"December 08, 2018","Viva is hands down has the best service center I have ever taken any of my cars for service. The one reason is because of service specialists, Gus Torres. He always goes above and beyond to take care of my family and me. Always gets my vehicles done, washed and delivered on time. I will always go and recommend Viva Chevy service department because of Gus. Thank you always for treating us right Mr.Gus. Viva needs to get him to train more people like him.",5.0
4,"November 27, 2018","Paul Duran and basically all the staff at Viva Chevrolet always make me feel like they do care about my concerns with my vehicle. I have gone to other Chevy shops in town and they don't even look at me when I drive up none the less ask what I'm there for. I literally walk up to service people and they keep brushing me off. Viva Chevrolet everyone makes sure to say hi!
After my vehicle was with Viva I never had to call and ask the status. They always text, email, and call which is great customer service. I am super impressed w/Viva and will continue to go there for anything and everything! 
Thanks to all!",5.0

9,"January 21, 2018","The Sales department did a good job at working around my budget and getting me an affordable car. It is about $85 more than what I was wanting to pay but all things considered that isn't too bad. The service department however was not good to me at all. Before I even bought the car, it had a broken tail light and they said they would fix it. First time I came to them and asked them what was the status of it they said they didn't have it and would need to order the part and would call me when it came in. Two months later still no call so I go back to the dealership and they ordered the light bulb and not the actual part that was broken. From there they said that they would order the right part but that I would have to pay for it but that they would send me a check to pay for it. Months later and I didn't get a phone call, no check, and when I went back, again no part. Finally after having the car for almost a year it wasn't until I talked to Adrian Lopez that the issue FINALLY got fixed. Why did it take almost a year to get a part in that was broken BEFORE I even got a ""new"" car? if it was ""new"" why was it already broken and not repaired and why did I have to go through so much work to get it fixed? I'm the customer not the employee. It shouldn't be me that is doing all this work to get this fixed when it was the dealership who said they would fix this car if I bought it from them. If the dealership is expecting trust and loyalty from their costumers then they should give us a reason to have it. How can I trust this dealership if they say that they will fix a part and call me when it comes in and then never do either of those things? Why did I have to go TO the dealership several times within a year to get an issue fixed  that should have been fixed in a few days from the purchase? I don't feel like you care about the customers the way you say you do. At least I feel like I can go to Adrian Lopez and he will get the problem fixed seeing as within a year he was the only one who finally did. So to him I say thank you.",4.0

12,"December 20, 2017","I had some really bad issues with my vehicle and I didn't want to take it to a mom and pop shop because we all know what would happen there. I stop by the nearest Chevrolet Dealership were Guz Torres and his team did many tests to try and figured out what was wrong with it. In no less then 5 hours they got my Camaro back and running as if it was brand new again! They had a very friendly staff and Guz went all the way out of his way to get me a rental car for work purposes. If your looking for great customer service, quick, and efficient work on you vehicle there is only 1 place to go. Stop by with Mr. Torres he will take care of you! Thank you for everything!",5.0
13,"December 19, 2017","Oscar was amazing. He followed through with us and was very patient. We had been looking for a suburban in our price range since September and knew we had to wait for the right time. When I contacted Oscar again in December, he helped me without hesitation and remembered who I was. He worked hard to get us the best deal and was successful. Not only did we get the car we really wanted, but Oscar went out of his way to ensure we were in and out of the dealership in an hour and half. With 2 toddlers and an infant, that was the best part of it all. Thank you again and we couldn't be any happier with our purchase!",5.0
14,"December 13, 2017","Excellent service!  I had been with other dealerships such as KIA that had horrible service and never made you feel wanted.
I couldn't believe how much they were willing to give in order to make you feel wanted and to know that you were getting a great deal!
They really bent over backward to give me the best possible payments, zero down, and no payments for 90 days during the holidays!  I coudn't believe it!
The quality of the product plus the warranties and protection given from the manufacturer definitely gave me peace of mind.
Their sales team is the best and were extremely helpful in every way.
Best purchase I've ever made! ",5.0

18,"October 17, 2017","Went in for an oil change and I feel I got ripped off.  There are coupons that could have been offered to me, but they weren't. I got charged over 70 dollars for an oil change.  As far as 5 points inspection, or whatever they call it, I seriously doubt it. I asked to have a loose cable dangling from the bottom of my truck looked at and put back where it belongs.  All they did was place the cable over a piece of frame, by the time I got home it was dangling again.  Lazy service department and not very thorough. It makes me wonder if they even rotated the tires, because when I got home I checked the pressure on them and they were all off.  I would have been better off taking it to Pronto Lube, or Pep Boys, or a mom and pop shop on Alameda.",1.6

31,"October 17, 2016",Bought my truck during labor day weekend. First long drive to Cruces heard a rattling sound on the drive back.  Took truck to have it checked out.  Provided a rental as stated by dealership since I had purchased the warranty.  My truck was in the shop for 3 weeks but Gus kept in touch with me once a week on the status of the truck.  Truck is fixed with no problems.  I am satisfied with the service provided and rental as promised.,5.0

37,"September 28, 2016","I'm giving Viva Chevy a 5 Star rating because this team ROCKS! I recently had to drop off my 2015 Chevy Silverado with the service team at Viva Chevy, due to a dead battery.  My service technician was Daniel.  He was very professional and easy to talk to about the truck.  After a brief overview of the truck, he assured me that the truck would be fine and that they would find the source of the problem. Daniel was swift in also noticing that my truck had a recall to take care of and asked me if they could take care of that as well.   A Chevy Malibu was loaned to me for the duration of the service repair so I could get back to work. (A beautiful and fun car by the way) After several days, Daniel notified me via email and phone call of the status and that upon approval, my truck would have its battery replaced under warranty.  A day later, Daniel called me to let me know my truck was ready.  Overall, this service went very well, and I was pleased to get back into my own vehicle. I highly recommend Daniel and the team at Viva Chevy!",5.0

41,"February 01, 2016","I purchased a truck about nine months ago from Jesus Alderete.  I have bought many cars in the past but for the first time I received service without being pressured to buy. Jesus was patient and listened to my needs for a new truck and was able to offer different options within my budget. Jesus is a candid and reliable professional.   I was so glad with the purchase that I bought a suburban for my wife a few months ago.  Now I know who to look for in my next purchase.

Jesus also guided us to the Finance where Manuel Beltran explained the financing options and  also helped in securing a good interest rate from a local bank. The complete process was smooth and prompt,

I will highly recommend Jesus Alderete and Viva Chevy team at Montana. By the way, they allowed me hit the dong!!

42,"November 25, 2015","I feel like this may have been a good experience over all, but the manager named Robert Herrera is the single most shadiest person I've ever dealt with. I was warned by others not to go to Viva but against my better judgement I gave them a chance. Let's put I this way, make sure your forms are signed by ONLY YOU, because Herrera had no problem signing things in your name. Dude should be fires",1.2

44,"September 01, 2015","Bought a 2013 chevy sonic from this company around 2 months ago. I stated I was in the military and was looking for a good reliable car. I had a pre-approved loan through my bank and I was able to put down half of the total amount upfront as a down payment. Now the problem is that my pre-approved loan was around 7% interest and they offered me a loan at 6%. Being the naive and inexperienced guy I am I accepted that offer. So I bought the car thinking I recieved a good deal with 6% interest only to find out over a month later I am paying close to 17%. Sure enough I read over my car paperwork again and there it was 17% Now yes it was my fault for not reading the paperwork as thoroughly as I should of. But at the end of the day how can you trust this business? Here I am, A young soldier (with excellent credit I may add) wanting to buy his first car and I get taken advantage of like that? That is no way a reputable business should operate. Horrible company and I want Viva Chevy to know this will not be the first negative review you will be hearing from this man.",1.6

47,"March 28, 2015","My sister took my mothers 2010 Impala in to be looked at for the steering and the shifter not unlocking.  I told the service advisor (Jesse) to not do any work that was NOT covered by the extended warranty.   About 1 hour later, he calls and tells me that he has already started taking the shifter apart and that I told him to do it.   I again told him, I DID NOT tell him to do the work and told him he was a liar for claiming I authorized the work.   In total, they took 15 days to change the power steering pump and then they left all the parts from the shifter on the floor of the passenger side of the car.   When I took the car to my normal, honest mechanic, he discovered that they had left out one of the parts for the shifter during the time they had the car for the 15 days it took to repair it.
So, when I returned for the part, the service manager refused to find my part and blamed the loss on my mechanic.   I have used my mechanic for years and years, (Show & Go - on Dyer St in El Paso) and they are as honest as they come.   They are some of the few mechanics I would definitely trust.   Viva Chevrolet lost my part because they had the car for a ridiculous amount of time.",1.2
48,"June 11, 2013","Viva, motivated to Fail!

My original intent was to have a tow package installed on a 2011 Traverse.  After calling and pricing first, we chose Viva because they were well below their competitors.  It turns out its because they only quote parts prices.  Asking to have a tow package installed doesn't get any gears turning in their brains.  The real price was closer to $550 with labor, which was okay because it was similar to what I had researched and was around what I truely expected to pay.  I let the gross pricing error slide and I gave viva the benefit of the doubt. 

The tow package was scheduled for a Saturday (it was a 1/2 day job).  Three days later on a Monday night I finally got my car back.  Service did not call to let us know, but instead allowed us to ""chase"" them via phone.  When you finally get Ralph his famous line is ""I was just going to call you.""  He wasn't.  However, after getting it back I was pleased, briefly.

That weekend I went to a friends house to get my new trailer they had stored while my vehicle was equipped with the tow package.  After hooking the trailer up, the electric didn't work.  I called several times and was told to bring it back.  This time I took it on a Friday.  After chasing Ralph down via phone and finding out he was ""just going to call."" We learned they would need to keep the car over night.  They had gotten the tow package electric to work, but now the vehicle power wasn't working.  Saturday was more of the same and we also attempted to call the service manager.  We were told they would need it until Monday.  

Monday rolled around and my wife made several calls to the GM and service manager.  Ralph finally called us back, neither manager bothered. They said they would need the car over night again.  Tuesday came and still no real update.  I finally stopped work to call them and said enough is enough.  Remove the accessories and refund my money.  What happened next was truely remarkable.  The staff was finally motivated. 

Within 1 hour I was notified my vehicle was ready to pick up.  Ralph sounded so happy to tell me.  As I was driving to get it after work I go a second call.  This time they wanted to know if I would make it by 6pm or if they would need to keep the cashier late.  Really?  I couldn't get them to call once when I was paying hundreds of dollars, but tell them you don't want to do business and they will jump thru hoops to please you?  It's a technique I suppose.  

It's fairly obvious to me that the staff do not respect the management at the dealership.  And when I see how the management neglects the customers, I can only assume that if they treat the employees the same way, it's a recipe for disaster.  I can not believe that the staff are so motivated to watch their leaders fail, yet have no motivation to see the leaders succeed.  It's truely a shame that they dealership has such poor leadership and in the end what you have is a bunch of unmotivated people just going to work to make money with no real desire to shine.  

Viva, where the management motivates the workers to Fail!",1.0
49,"March 29, 2013","our experience with the whole sales team was ridiculous.  we purchased a car from them only to have them call and harass our reference contacts about returning it about a month later, turned out the sales manager lied to the bank about our information knowingly and told us it would be OK, then the dealership did not turn in the correct info for the car so our deal got ""kicked back"".  After talking to Robert about this, his employees continued to harass our reference contacts and when we brought this to his attention he didn't seem interested in fixing the problem. so we returned the car just to find out that they already went ahead and bought our trade in and basically refused to let us keep it saying we had to buy it back.  my husband is active duty military and works really hard and i am completely horrified that a business can treat a man in uniform this badly.",1.0
50,"March 23, 2013",I took my truck in two times to this dealership to have work done it and it was the same negative experience each time. They promise to contact you to update you on your vehicle's status but I didn't receive one call. When I would call no one ever picked up the phone. I was told my car would be looked at and a call back would be made to me regarding the next steps but no looks at the car and no phone call from Ralph regarding the status. No one ever seems to know what's going on and although they order their apologies that seems to be all they are good at. I do not recommend this place for any reason. ,1.8
51,"November 28, 2011",bought a car that gave in about nine months after it was purchased.

52,"October 10, 2011","My husband and I went to Viva Chevrolet to look at used cars as we were in the market for a Honda Fit.  Due to the earthquake in Japan these seem to be hard to find so even though we had wanted to buy new we decided to look into buying one used.  When we arrived at Viva Chevrolet we had a nice salesman help us and he looked to see if there were any Honda Fits at any of the other Viva dealerships and there were so he promptly took us there to look and instead we found a nice used toyota we really liked that had great cosumer reviews and we decided to buy it.  It was late when we did the deal and we were told the other Viva dealership the car we bought came from had the spare key and we would have to come back to get it Monday, we bought the car Friday night.  So three days later we came back to get the key and found that no effort was made to obtain the spare key.  Our salesman proceeded to call the sister dealership to look into getting the spare for us and found that there was in fact no spare for the car. Our salesman told us he would look into it and go to the sister dealership himself to see if the spare was misplaced and call us the next day (Tuesday).  We weren't interested in waiting any longer, as we already had waited three days, so we went to their sister dealership to have someone look for it.  While at Viva Dodge (their sister dealership) we were mistreated and spoke over by the gentleman in customer service and had no resolution.  Upon going back to Viva Chevrolet to resolve the issue that day we were given the run around by the sales manager, Robert Herrera, whom we waited a half hour to talk to and talked to for another half hour before he agreed to have another key made.  This was fine, however, our salesman told us we would have the car and the key by the end of the day this was at 12:30 in the afternoon.  At 5:17 pm the salesman called back telling us the car and key wouldn't be ready until Tuesday morning.  The salesman also informed us the manager waited around until 4:30pm to do anything, at which point a key wasn't able to be cut at a Toyota dealership (the maker of our new used car).  Conveniently enough the salesman got off work at 5 pm.  Our experience was extremely unprofessional, there was no care put into their customer service.  We are making a complaint about this dealer to their general manager.  It shouldn't take 4 days to get a key we were promised to have.   We waited around for a day to be told we wouldn't have our car back for another day.  The manager was dishonest and lazy and we will never buy from this dealer again or any other Viva dealer.  ",1.6
53,"July 31, 2010","I just purchased my first new car here at Viva Chevrolet. I did not start here. I first tried Rudolph Chevrolet. I waited outside for a while and absolutely nobody came out to help us.  My family and I were just left to ourselves.  When I made my way to Viva it was a total 180.  The treatment we received was great. They helped us right away and I got the Silverado I wanted. I also got a $5,000 discount which was GREAT!  Way to go Viva... Too bad for Rudolph.  I just wish the supervisor spoke better English. He was hard to understand.",5.0
