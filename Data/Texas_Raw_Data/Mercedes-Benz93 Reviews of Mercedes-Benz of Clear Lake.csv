1,"April 05, 2019",I referred a friend to MB-CL and they purchase a vehicle.  Most dealerships say that they have a referral program.  Majority of business is base on recommendations or referrals.  I even filled out the paperwork for my referral.  It's been 2 months and several phone calls and I still haven't received the money for my referral.  All future MB referrals will now go to MB of Sugarland. ,3.8
2,"November 30, 2018","After repairs were completed on my 2012 E350 Bluetec requiring replacement of both intake manifolds my engine light came on within two days. Seems like the same problem. There is limited power. I sent a text and called 5 times over several days with no response. Repairs cost more than $5,000 and previous repairs within a few months were over $10,000. It is as if my service advisor just does not care if the work was done properly. Over the years I have purchased four Mercedes and I was planning on replacing my wife’s ML 350. Rest assured, this is not going to happen with this dealership. My car is a lemon (probably spent as much as $20,000-$30,000 that has required(?) very expensive repairs over its life time, and Clear Lake Mercedes is not the place to purchase or service your car. I’m off to Mercedes of Sugarland, Texas to use a trusted service advisor and repair shop. ",1.2
3,"February 01, 2018","I will never be back here again!

My car was worked on here my (Steering Lock Motor) went out on my steering wheel and cost me $1,568.85 to fix. It was dropped off on Saturday and picked up on Yesterday (Tuesday), drove my car to work this morning and my check engine light came on. Called the dealership to find out if my battery would be kicking off my check engine light, and they informed me that it shouldn't but I would need to bring it in. I scheduled it to be brought in today at 12:00pm spoke with Eric the (Service Manager) and told him what my complaint was, he told me that they would pull it back and find out whats going on. I waited for about 15mins in the waiting area he came back in told me I was ready to go. He told me that an engine valve was left open, and that was it. Never one time received an apology from anyone for my inconvenience and their negligence of doing half as work I honestly believe if my husband came with me I would have been treated differently; but customer service is truly an lost art. Eric is a piss poor Service Manager and because of that I would never set foot in Mercedes-Benz of Clear Lake again!",1.2
4,"January 13, 2018",Ana saved the day with extra effort to secure a loaner when actual maintenance turnaround time (4 hours) was far longer than represented from call in number(1.5 hours). She overcame a stressful scheduling situation to find me a loaner since my schedule would not allow a 3-4 hour wait.  Front desk said I did not qualify for a loaner since the turnaround time was 1.5 hours.  Very frustrating and Ana worked diligently to fix the situation to my complete satisfaction.  I greatly appreciate the extra efforts.  Randy Parmley ,4.6

When i received an email that the car was ready i paid on line and showed up 30 minutes later to pick up my car.  I had to wait another 90 minutes.  They tried to make it up to me by offering a free detail.
I have been treated with more respect and courtesy at my honda, acura and mazda dealerships.  I am seriously considering selling the mercedes because of the terrible service dept at mercedes of clear lake.  ",2.4

20,"November 29, 2017",I had talked to Nafi Baber on the phone about the purchase of a new Spinter cargo crew van. He told me that they had a good selection in stock. When I arrived he had a van setting on the lot for my wife and I to look at. It was exactly what we were looking for. My wife took it for a test drive and was every happy with the salesman and how he explained in detail different things about the van.  I have purchased a lot of vehicles in my lifetime and have never been treated as well as I was treated at the Mercedes-Benz of Clear Lake. Nafi kept me informed on the progress of the van because we had a third row of seats put in and a backup camera installed. I also purchased an extended warranty and maintenance agree on my van thanks to Derrick Gray. ,5.0

24,"November 08, 2017","My wife and I went to trade in our Lexus for a Mercedes-just to look around--we wanted a 2018 model. We met Ken, our salesman, who pointed out and explained the features for us. As we were looking in the car lot a E300 2018 White with tan interior had just been unloaded from the delivery van, It immediately got my wife's  eye and she went over to look at it--it was the perfect car that she wanted to purchase. And after a very brief consultation with me of about 10 seconds--you can probably guess that was the car we bought! I have to agree it was the right choice--Ken explained the features and off we went to the office and finalized the purchase--I must also add that I received a very fair price for my trade in of the Lexus. 
We were also briefed on the technical and safety capabilities of the E300 by Marcus which included enabling safety features e.g. blind spot, park assist and technical e.g. mbrace, navigation--and about 2 week later a followup class. 
Then about 2 weeks later an indicator came on that I had low tire pressure in one of my tires. I immediately went to the Mercedes Clear Lake service department. There was a screw in the tire--I has purchased the tire warranty and a new tire was put on the car--outstanding response and quick service by Greg my service rep and Matt the shop. I also need to add that Cindy greets everyone in the customer lounge and ensures they are well taken care of and comfortable. 
I really want to thank the entire team at the dealership for making the purchase, training and service a smooth and rewarding experience climaxing with us ending up with the right Mercedes for us.
P.S. Jerry, the general manager came out and spent time giving us a warm welcome to the dealership.

My bill was incorrect, Alejandro was quick to resolve the issue without any hassles. No loaner car available but the shuttle wait was not very long. My visit was Friday, Oct. 13, 2017.

53,"August 03, 2017","I am very disappointed with my experience at Mercedes Benz Clear Lake.  Having been recently pre-approved with my bank at ExxonMobil I was ready to purchase a band new car.  The salesman, Ozair Azim was very nice while he assisted me in a test drive.  After realizing that the GLE was going to be too small for me and my family Ozair offered me the next bigger vehicle which is GLS.  I was gladly to share the details with my mother which we then later agreed that his would be the best fit for us.  Ozair mentioned a couple times about the exporting trouble they have been dealing with but I was not aware or knew what he was talking about.

After giving me the option to build my own 2018 GLS online, Ozair and his manger rejected my order because apparently the color that I have selected was one of the high demands for exporting companies.  I am extremely disappointed with the dealerships accusation of me being involved with any sort of exporting deals.  This rejection to purchase the vehicle I want was unethical and discriminating. The dealership should not stereotype anyone for the exporting problems they cannot get under control.  This is none of my concern, I just simply wanted to purchase the vehicle that best suits me and my family.  Mercedes Benz Clear Lake illegally labeled me as an exporter for selecting the color vehicle I wanted.

After several so-called negotiations I was presented with the ORIGINAL MSRP price. Once brought to her attention she said it was a mistake.
I was then sent into another room where the representative was not smiling. Apparently he an attitude assuming I would not puchase additional feautures which meant he too would not get his commission. His tone was very aggressive. He told me I would save money if I bought the oil change package. I explained the sales lady previously told me different info. He immediately left the office and went to get her. She and I went back and forth as to what she said. Although she was right, she realize he was upset because of her disclosure. I felt so uncomfortable.

89,"June 11, 2013","This is the bottom line worst car I have ever purchased and the dealership is even worse than the car.  I purchased an ML350, 5 days after I purchased the car it had to go in for service and in less than 20 months the car has been in 21 times!  Everything from the rear hatch not working (constant problem), sunroof, cam shafts leaking, oil leaking, random lights not working, battery going dead for no reason and stranding me, and the last one was the a/c going out completely.  Of course out of 21 times in the dealership my service advisor who is the only decent part of this experience does not know what to do except to schedule me for service for next month in advance because she knows soon something else will go wrong.  When Mercedes was contacted they offered me 1k toward and new car but wanted to give me 25k less than I paid for it!  What a joke,  I wanted to give it back after the first incident and they said they would check to see what they could give me for it, I knew then I was in trouble, I just had no idea how bad it was going to be.  Don't consider this dealership, if the car is not a lemon then your safe but if it is this dealership will make ever excuse in the book not to stand behind a car that is deffinetly not what I thought I was purchasing.

I even bought the extended warranty to cover myself since this was a used car being sold ""as is"". Once I took control of the car I noticed the voice command was not working and my driver seat was tore in an area not readily visible. I took car back to get items fixed and they refused to fix the items since this was an ""as is"" car even though they told me nothing was wrong with it. The extended warranty refuse to pay since this was a preexisting condition. I got a call from the sale rep(Derrick) and the sale manager and they got real nasty with me on the phone and demanding the loaner car back.

The purpose for me to get this car was because I was t-bone in January and wanted to replace my car plus I was making plans to buy a new Mercedes later on. Not any more! Alex Rodriguez should really take his name off this dealership as they are nothing but deceitful people that just want to take advantage of the situation.

Oh let me add I am not a man of money and I even gave them 18k in cash to only be treated like this, what a disappointment!!!",1.8
