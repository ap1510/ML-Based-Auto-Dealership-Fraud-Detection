0,"June 29, 2011","We drove to meet a salesman regarding a new 2011 chevrolet silverado 3500hd. (A $59K truck!!!!) we got to the dealership close to closing time, he met us outside- asked us to take a seat, test drove our trade-in, 5 minutes later he came back, wrote down our phone number, and said he would call us tomorrow when he could get an idea of the value of our trade (which was a 2008 model diesel truck). So much for Bacon wanting to sell a vehicle if it is anywhere close to 6 o'clock!!! The next morning we met with James Brown at Van Chevrolet in Carrolton (TX) and purchased our new truck! BAD Business David Westbrook!!!!!!!",1.6
1,"July 20, 2010","Our Suburban was towed to the Bacon Chevrolet in Palestine.  The first 2 times I called, no one ever picked up the phone after I was transferred.  The third call, I finally got to talk to someone who told me they did not have time to even look at the car and there was nothing they could do and could not provide a rent car until a mechanic looked at it.  (we live 3.5 hours away)  They got it to start and told us it was just the battery.  We were 3 miles down the road with the stabiltrak and traction control light began to come on again and then the check engine light came on about an hour later.  It would not start once we returned home and turned the vehicle off.  I took it to another dealership this morning that has much better customer service.",1.8
