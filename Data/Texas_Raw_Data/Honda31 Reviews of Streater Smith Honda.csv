The other dealers in Conroe wouldn't give me the time of day, by the way. Found the perfect car (unbeknownst to me @ the time) from a wonderful salesman (who cared). I drove that '96 Grand Am til 2007 when it finally died w/ 433,000 miles on it. And I have told everyone! Unfortunately, I moved away from the Conroe area. When I've been close, couldn't afford to ""shop"" for a car. I may be in the market still yet, & may still pay them a visit.",5.0
1,"October 13, 2016","I went in to buy a honda ridgeline. But I was way upside down on used car I was in already. Was told other dealer I need $5,000.00 down with trade. Did not get ridgeline. But salesman got me out of bad car and into a 2014 nissan frontier with $0.00 down out of my pocket. Best sales man Brett Bailey and manager team I ever worked with. Would recommend anyone to buy from streater smith honda!",5.0

3,"April 05, 2016","Steer clear and stay FAR, FAR  away from this dealership and the General Managers', Mike Boston & David Le.  Terrible communication from flow of info from Sales manager to sales rep.  I worked out a fair deal for a 2016 Honda Pilot including the promise that the dealership would match or better my credit union's finance rate of 1.74%.

The vehicle was delivered 2 months later, and we were meeting for the final paper work, I received a written email from the (sales rep) that they would shop around for the best rate using soft pulls and then pursue no more than 3 sources for the best rate to compete with my loan.  Little known to me, the sales manager decided to ""shop around"" and hard pull my credit 11 times.  When I found this out, the financial manager David Meyer said, ...""that was unusual and it usually only goes to about 3 max but it won't affect my score since I have an 849 FICO.""... 

What!!  Totally beside the point, it is the principle of the action of pursuing a rate that starts at 2.5 and goes to 2.15 ...what was the expected outcome??...to lure me in and force me to sign with them if they abused my credit score enough??..I expressed my concern and wishes that the original agreement was honored of matching or bettering my loan instead of ruining my credit inquiry score and not honoring the rate match deal we had in WRITING.  All David could offer was an apology and an, ""oops, our bad"", attitude.

Needless to say I would have left, but our lease was up and I had already waited for 2 months for the vehicle to be delivered.  So we took the vehicle and I am now in the process of dealing with the credit unions and trying to clear my inquiry list from my record.  My score only dropped 3 points but those 11 hard pulls will stay on my record for the next 2 years.

I contacted my sales rep, who no longer works under Mike Boston, as well as the internet sales Rep Catherine Perales,  to relay my concerns and frustrations to Mike Boston and David Le.  
To date, I have heard NOTHING from the Sales Manager or the General Manager, and they have avoided all contact including text, email and send all my calls to voicemail.  Only a generic Thank You and this Yelp request have been received..ha..completely out of touch

Reminds me of old school bait and switch routines.  I am upset this entire deal happened this way, unfortunately, this is not the first Honda dealer that underhandedness and lies have occurred at.  Had a different situation but unfortunate outcome at Sterling McCall a couple years ago, but that is another story.

Do yourself a favor and use Streater-Smith as nothing more than a business who will match you on price and then use that info and go elsewhere to do your business.  They are a very dishonest dealership. You have been warned!",1.6
4,"November 18, 2015","Best Car Buying Experience!!! All, we got some sweet new wheels today  and I must say, Jeff Bashor? , truly changed my Honda experience! He saved the day after having such a negative experience at the Honda of Clear Lake (Don't go to that one! They will lie to you!). I made the drive to Streeter-Smith Honda in Conroe because Jeff and I had a great conversation about what he and his manager were willing to do to win my business. Amazing customer experience from the phone call, to walking in the door and being greeted by name, and even going over every detail of the features of the car to make sure I was completely comfortable with my new car.  Extremely genuine personalities (Jeff, his sales and finance manager also!) and desire to help find the perfect car. BTW, their new fleet of cars are so sick awesome! Take the drive to them and you will be so happy you did! Thank you Jeff! You are a friend of our family now!",5.0

8,"August 11, 2015","I was told they were a fair dealership and in the end fair and honest was not what we got.  We negotiated a deal on a Saturday and had our own financing but were told they would try to beat it.  The vehicle we were interested in was so new on the lot it needed to go through service and be cleaned and detailed so we were told it couldn't be taken home until that was completed.  We got a ""Purchase Agreement"" showing what they would give for our trade in as well as what we would be buying the car for.  Not once did anyone say it needed to be signed or did they offer to draw up paperwork on the guaranteed rate.  My husband goes to the dealership on Monday to get everything signed and is met by a very rude Used Car Sales Manager (Chip) that told him he wasn't interested in the deal they offered to us on Saturday and informs him that it wasn't a binding contract and they don't have to honor what they said and put down on paper for us.  They wanted $4,000 more than what they quoted for the vehicle.  In an attempt to talk to someone above him they gave us to the Sales Manager for the new cars which is his equal.  No help there and as he talked to us he slouched in his seat showing that he had no concern whatsoever for our situation.  We were asked why we didn't sign a contract for the guaranteed rate, well probably because nobody offered to draw one up Mark.  What they did was underhanded and shady.  If the people there priced the vehicle wrong, that is an internal issue and should have been handled as such and the customer shouldn't have had to deal with the recourse on that.  This is the exact reason people are apprehensive when dealing with car dealerships and they give others a bad name.  If I could have given them zero stars, I would have.  I emailed the owner of the dealership and of course have heard nothing back.  Maybe he's ok with them doing business that way and if that's the case, I definitely do not want to deal with them and will let anyone I know how we were treated.  I wouldn't wish that on my worst enemy.",1.2

10,"July 01, 2015","Don't worry we have a good warranty for the car which barely had 42,000.00 miles on it.... Well come to find out they handed us the wrong paperwork for the WARRANTY. What a SCAM. We have been trying to get straight answers from them the last 3 months and could not get a straight answer. Provided us a 1-800 # only for it to be for roadside assistance. Trying to get the car fixed and even this dealership is saying OH WELL, when in fact they are the ones providing the INCORRECT INFORMATION. The warranty company paperwork provided to us was not even a company which had our information, and when I would call the dealership I would get bounced all over the place!!Now we are having to foot the bill for expensive repairs and they are not willing to assist in any way!!! Beware of this dealership!!! I swear they POCKETED THE MONEY. Now we cannot even drive the vehicle without being concerned if we will be in an accident. WE even questioned the problem with the salesman to have it looked at before we left and ensured us the problem had been fixed!!! LIARS",1.6
11,"June 24, 2015","We knew we wanted a specific vehicle so after dealing with a less than pleasant  Spring  Honda Dealership who were unwilling to get us the color we preferred and couldn't give us any straight forward numbers, we backed out discouraged.  Thankfully, we happened upon Mike Boston at Streater Smith.  I emailed him with our preference and asked for an out the door price.  He didn't play games, gave us the out to door price, which beat other dealerships absolute best by just under $2600.  He guaranteed the color we wanted, without hassle, and within hours, I was driving the car home.  He went out of his way to make it a no hassle, easy, car buying experience.  He even loaned us a DVD for the kids to watch on the way home, in our new car.   We highly recommend Mike Boston at Streater Smith, if you want an expedient, honest transaction for your next car.

12,"May 18, 2015","I had such a great experience with my first car purchase (first-time buyer) two years ago, I'm thinking of buying another from them. Brett is a honest, no-pressure salesman - he made it really enjoyable to buy a car. He, as well as the service department, continues to follow up.

13,"May 11, 2015","I don’t usually take time to write reviews, but today I am. Friday I bought a new Honda Odyssey from Streater Smith Honda. I could not be happier. My experience at Streater Smith was great!

I have bought my share of new cars from dealers and have had both good and bad experiences, and some great buying experiences.  Great buying experiences are had at dealers where they listen to what you say and are honest about their prices. Bad experiences are had at dealers that don’t. Again, this was a great buying experience. This is the way it should be.

I looked at TrueCar and Edmunds and reached out to about 8 dealers in my area for quotes. I find it is easier to start this way.  I got back emails with everything from just a call back number to a detailed quote that showed a drive-out price. The typical response was a dollar amount that included dealer installed options that I didn’t want or a statement like “This price does not include dealer installed options”. Some of the quotes was just too high.

Mike Boston at Streater Smith sent me a detailed, straight forward, quote that included the drive-out price. It also included this statement, “*Price includes all dealer install accessories if applicable, available on in stock unit only, must be financed with AHFC (W.A.C.).” His price was the best overall.  Also, there were no dealer add-ons.  

Streater Smith didn’t have the color I wanted in-stock, but they were able to do a dealer-trade. That raised the price some, but they were up-front about it. That’s the price of being married to a certain color.

I picked up the van Friday morning. When I arrived, it was ready to go.  The drive-out price was as quoted. When I met with David Meyer in finance, he explained the finance options and the optional extended maintenance. No pressure. The drive-out price quoted was the drive-out price.

Again, I couldn’t be happier. Honest price. Good price. No surprises. I highly recommend Mike Boston at Streater Smith.

14,"April 12, 2015","
LIES..TRICKERY..DECEPTION..Everything negative that people tell you about car dealerships and car salesmen, THIS PLACE IS PERFECT for experiencing everything above. Juan Moreno quoted me for a 2015 Honda Odyssey EX-L via e-mail. I e-mailed him twice and called him thrice to confirm everything that he had listed in his quote and to make sure that there was no hidden fees or 'Catch'. After repeated assurances from him that there was no deception, and that everything on the quote was 'As Is' and the buying process would be as smooth and painful as possible, I drove 50 miles with my pregnant wife to go look at the car and buy it. After a walk through, test drive, and approval for credit, when it came time to price, he suddenly disappeared in to the ""Manager's office"" and came back after 20 minutes. Then he walked in and uttered the cliched, classic car dealer phrase, ""I made a MISTAKE"". He mentioned that the quote he sent me was too low and that he made an honest mistake and he would try to make it right by offering me a better deal. What he offered was 3-4 thousand dollars higher than the quoted price. We were appalled at this behavior. All this after my repeated attempts to confirm the prices, and accessories offered on the quote. We asked to speak to the ""Manager"", and there was complete apathy. The ""Manager"" did not even bother to show up. Completely unethical practice of sending low quote as a bait to draw the consumer and not honoring the quote. LIES..TRICKERY..DECEPTION..that is Streater Smith Honda (Conroe, TX) to you. I RANK THE EXPERIENCE AS EXTREMELY POOR and give Streater Smith Honda ZERO STARS and would STRONGLY ENCOURAGE CONSUMERS TO STAY AWAY FROM THIS DEALERSHIP.

15,"September 17, 2014","I have purchased two vehicles from this  dealership and when I called and questioned (after I purchased the car ) about why at 53,000 miles a radiator had been changed- I was told a lie and demeaned on the phone whole my kids listened in awe. They dl said it was Texas and this was common- REALLY? After I complained, they actually tried to sell me another car getting MORE money. For months I had tried to cancel my extended warranty and they keep giving me the run around. Finally I was in the dealership so I went to Dave and told him I would like to do what I need to do to finish the cancelation. He got all riled up and started to say he was in lunch and accusing me of doing something with the paperwork and I told him I did not know their paperwork process but I had come in months prior to cancel it and they should have the documents. I was upset by this time and contacted Mike the manager. He tried to snooze me over but defended the workers. After two cars purchased there was no respect and I was demonized repeatedly but two department. I am one of the nicest people around which is oxymoronic to their treatment. Their arrogance and dishonest sales methods are dirty business and would never suggest this place. The Dodge dealership across the freeway and John Eagle which my daughter bought a car from and my mom, respectively has always been treated fair there- that I would suggest. NOT STREATER SMITH.",1.0

I did not think I was going to be able to get into a brand new CR-V with no money down, but Brian was excellent in getting me into a brand new 2013 Honda CR-v.

Thank you again Brian and Streater-Smith Honda, Just north of high prices.

Then called Mike, and worked with him all week until we could look at the vehicle. We did not feel haggled and the communication was very straghtforward from the entire team at Streater-Smith. A new standard was created by this car buying experience. Thank you all for your help!",5.0

22,"August 31, 2012","Great Experience buying a new car !! I worked with Slavco, buying a new Insight in July. My purchase involved a trade-in and financing -- so there was every possible way to over-charge me known to man. I have been around long enough to know all the dealer tricks. But Slavco and the Streater-Smith deal on the car, the deal on the trade, and the financing were all TOP NOTCH. Slavco was very patient, very good at answering questions, and worked incredibly hard to close the sale. It was a sweltering hot humid day, and he ran all over the lot pulling cars for me to test drive. He must have put a couple miles in, just walking to do what was needed to sell the car. He was honest as the day is long. The trade-in allowance was SUPER fair. The financing department was very efficient and knowledgable. I would absolutely buy another car from Streater-Smith. Everyone there was VERY approachable and helpful. (this is my second honda from Streater). The buying experience was better for me than my BMW experience in 2006. On a car half the price of the BMW. Wow. I have never owned a hybrid before -- wouldnt even consider one. I've owned SUV's, BMWs, hondas. I gotta tell you, the Insight is a great vehicle. Best car-buying decision I ever made.

23,"July 05, 2012","My wife and I visited Streater & Smith Honda to look for a new vehicle.  We drove north from The Woodlands hoping to find less high pressure salesmen in Conroe than in Houston, even though there is a much larger Honda dealership closer in Spring with more models in stock.  We were looking for a vehicle for my wife, so she wanted to drive the new CR-V's to see how she liked them.  What the salesman did not know is that my wife is 2 months pregnant, so we need to buy a larger vehicle for her, nor did he know that we had a blank check from the bank sitting at home, ready to purchase a new vehicle.  We just told him that we were looking a new vehicles and wanted to drive a CR-V.  Clarence waited on us.  He was very nice at first, but after standing out in the Texas heat for an hour or so looking at different models, test driving, talking with the salesman, etc., my wife (being 2 months pregnant) was tired, and wanted to go home and think about it.  Clarence then disappeared multiple times for an extended period of time.  When he returned he really began the high pressure sales, asking why we didn't want to buy that night.  He kept pushing and pushing, and would not accept no for an answer.  I didn't feel that my wife being pregant and tired was any of his business, and he should just accept that we didn't want to buy that night.  Well, he did not accept no for an answer, and he wouldn't let up.  Finally I asked him to see if he could get any better price on the car and call me because I was ready to go.  He then said that it was their policy that we were not allowed to leave without completing all of their sales checklist so he had to go talk to his manager to see if we were allowed to leave.  I said ""not if you want to sell a car to me"" and walked out the door.  He followed us out the door still trying to get us to buy a car from him.  I explained that we would not be buying that night, but if he would call me regarding the price, we were still interested.  He has never called.  Based on my experience at Streater & Smith Honda, I would not recommend Streater & Smith Honda to anyone.  I've had a lot of shady car salesman in my day, but I've never had one be so bold as to say we weren't allowed to leave because their policy did not allow us to.  If you're in the market for a new car, I would recommend that you shop elsewhere.  Very poor customer service from this dealership.

We worked with Mike Boston who was very professional. He did not put pressure on us and made the experience the most streamline and easiest we ever had. We were in and out within 3 hours. He has followed up with us several times just to make sure we are enjoying our new Honda Civic. We have been Honda customers for many many years and always enjoy our dealings with Streater-Smith Honda.

27,"March 26, 2012","My wife bought her used Honda CRV in 2010 before we got married. First off the car is a 2007 but it was labeled and sold as a 2008. Now this is not truly a big deal (except maybe adding money to the final sales price), but why was nothing said to her about it? Well lets fast forward to the present day. We now are married and have a newborn baby boy. A few weeks ago my wife brought her car in to get the oil changed as she always does when its time for regular maintenance. I was at work and was unable to go with her as I usually do. She went in got the maintenance completed and life went on as usual. A few days ago I changed her wiper blades to better ones for the safety of her as well as my newborn boy. I popped the hood and noticed that the fluids in the radiator and brake reservoir were low as well as the air cleaner box was not properly secured with all the metal clasps. This upset me because when I am at work my wife uses this vehicle and my baby boy is always with her. I took the vehicle to Streater Smith to address the issues in a very polite manner only to get the excuse from a smirking service employee that they do not top off fluids in the radiator or brake reservoir. The service employee still with a grin on his face said that the radiator stays too hot to check and that if the brake reservoir is low then the brakes are wearing down and need to be checked. I politely said thank you and have a nice day only because I did not want to argue with this employee that obviously does not want to deal with customers. Not once did he offer to even take a look at the vehicle or offer to have a tech look at it. Now if these fluids were low and as he said are due to other problems why did they not say that to my wife? We all know brakes are important and as far as the radiator excuse goes well I know that after two hours of waiting for the vehicle to be finished that the radiator is cooled enough to check. These are potential safety issues and yet they were not even noted on the receipt. Great service guys, keep up the good work. From now on we will seeking our service else where.",1.0

29,"August 18, 2010","This is in regards to insurance repairs done on my 2002 Honda Accord.   

Background:  To be brief, a thief broke into my car and tore apart my steering column and trim to try to hot-wire my Accord.  The damage was mostly cosmetic with the exception that it began to have periodic issues starting.

The Problem:  Streater-Smith Honda Service was recommended to me even though it was over 20 miles from my home.  I began working with Service Advisor Dee Dee Johnson.  I left my Accord with them for a few days.  They were not able to replicate the starting issue and proceeded to replace all the trim pieces and the ignition switch.  I provided these parts because I had already purchased them shortly after the incident.  Dee Dee walked me out to my car in the parking lot and everything looked fine at a glance because all the trim was put back together.  Upon returning home, I decided to inspect their work a little more detailed.  Without removing anything, I was able to reach my fingers up though the steering column adjustment lever and feel something was wrong.  Instead of replacing the plastic cover which protects the ignition wire contact points, they put a piece of foam tape over it and call it “good”.  When I called Streater-Smith Honda about this finding, I was told “the cover wasn’t mentioned on the insurance adjuster’s estimate, so it wasn’t replaced”.  First of all, if a shop finds addition issues with an insurance repair or any other repair, isn’t it normal to say something and recommend the job be done correctly instead of applying a band-aid and saying it is done?  I would hope so.  Streater-Smith Honda did not.  They passed it off as fixed.
I took the car back into them to fix what they had not done correctly the first time.  I again left it with them for a few days while I traveled for work.  In order to replace the small cover, I was told they had to replace the ignition and all the locks to match the new ignition.  Everything would be rekeyed and I would be provided with a new set of keys at pickup.  I was contacted when ready.  I picked up the car, but was not escorted by any company representative to inspect the rework and left assuming everything was fine.  Within a week the intermittent starting problem happened again.  I immediately called to let Dee Dee know that the starting issue was still there and I would need to arrange to bring it back, but that I was very busy with work and travel that since it was only intermittent and hasn’t left me stranded, I would wait until my schedule freed up or the problem got so bad I couldn’t drive it, whichever came first.  
Just over a month later, my schedule began to slow a little where I could plan some time to take it in.  About that time, it began acting up again and not starting on the first try.  I became suspicious of the workmanship of Streater-Smith Honda and decided to make sure they put everything back together again correctly.  I carefully lowered the bottom column cover and found the alignment posts bent and mutilated.  In addition, after only removing the three screws which attach the cover to the column, I went to remove the wire harness grommet from the cover and found it wasn’t attached like it was designed to be.  In fact, the grommet on the wire harness was pointing up instead of down, so it could not have been reattached to the column cover as designed.   I then noticed that the point the wire harness attaches to the bottom column was broken.  Since this cover was new and installed the first time it could have only been broken the second time when they took every apart to replace the plastic ignition cover.  The technician apparently wasn’t careful removing the bottom column cover and broke the grommet attach point try to remove the cover to work on the ignition.  The cover is designed to be difficult to remove/replace and the ignition switch & wire harness would have to have been adjusted to install the cover correctly.  This must explain why the harness attachment grommet was turned in the wrong direction and not attached properly.  
Based on my findings, I was no longer comfortable taking my car back to Streater-Smith Honda (my right as the insured).  I was instructed by my insurance adjuster, that to get the cover replaced, I would have to work it out directly with Streater-Smith since it was a “customer service” issue.  I proceeded to contact them and spoken with both Dee Johnson (Service Advisor) and Mark Miller (Service & Parts Director).  I was told they would not replace the bottom column cover ($20) their technician broke because 1) I had removed the cover (how else would I have found out they broke it) and 2) I took it to another dealer to finish trying to fix my Accord.  
Conclusion:  You are better off taking your $25,000-35,000 investment to another Honda dealer with technicians that are careful and treat your car as they should.

30,"October 14, 2009","I purchased a used 2004 Nissan from a Streater Smith on 10/29/07. When I purchased the vehicle the Streater Smith’s Buyers Guide Information Sheet for the vehicle stated a ""balance of factory warranty still applied” and a ""service contract was available at an extra charge"". I purchased the Nissan Gold Security Plus Vehicle Protection Plan (72 months/100,000 miles - with $50.00 deductible) from the Streater Smith at the time of purchase. This month (10/1/09) my vehicle had a major repair (Complete Transmission Replacement at 56,000 miles) and we were informed by Clear Lake Nissan that our warranty was not valid. We contacted Streater Smith and they informed me that shortly after we purchased the vehicle Nissan declined the warranty and the Streater Smith sent a refund check to our financial institution for the purchase amount of the warranty. We were never contacted by Streator Smith (mail or phone) informing us that the warranty was declined, they simply sent a refund check to the financial institution and that was all. I purchased a vehicle and a warranty in good faith from Streater Smith and was never informed at the time of purchase that the warranty could be revoked or declined at any time...if that was the case I would have never purchased the vehicle. The Dealers Buyers Guide on the vehicle when I purchased the vehicle clearly stated that a ""Service Contract"" was available for this vehicle (I don't uderstand how this could be declined if it is advertised as available at the time of sale). The ""Nissan Gold Security Plus Vehicle Protection Plan"" that I purchased from Streater Smith clearly states ""I agree that my Service Agreement is effective NOW"". My experience with Streater Smith has not been good, we called Streater Smith many times and left many messages to contact us...they never return our calls and when we did get through we basically got a tough luck response. My vehicle was repaired at Clear Lake Nissan near Galveston. They also could not understand why this had happened. The Service Manager went out of his way to help me in this bad situation. He got Nissan to install a reconditioned transmission in my car and cover half of the cost. It still cost me $1,800.00 dollars, but at least they helped when I could not get any help from Streater Smith.",2.0
