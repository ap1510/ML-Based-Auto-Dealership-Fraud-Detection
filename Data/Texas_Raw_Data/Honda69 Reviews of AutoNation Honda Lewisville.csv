0,"June 22, 2020","We came to pick up a car that was serviced and we communicated the last name of the person who had dropped off the car, car type, color, etc. However, this dealership had erroneously put the first name as the last name. Then, the person who catered to us, Joe Sims, asked us who spoke to the person on the phone but we weren’t told we had to provide that specific information considering the database should find customers based on last name and vehicle type and more. Then Joe Sims’ tone to us was very mean because he was blaming us for giving the wrong name which is wrong. We gave both the first name and last name. Then, we gave the phone number and then we were referred to another very nice guy. While the second guy was very nice, Joe Sims was very mean to us. ",1.0

WE RECEIVED 3 EMAILS LETTING US KNOW THEY WERE PREPARING THE CAR AND IT WOULD BE PULLED UP AS SOON AS WE GET THERE.  HA!!  WE WENT IN, AND WAITED FOR 15 MIN AND ISHMAEL FINALLY PULLED THE CAR UP...BUT IT WASN'T OUR CAR.  THEY MADE IT APPEAR AS A MISTAKE.....THEN THEY SAID THEY'D GO GET IT.  ANOTHER 15MIN AND THE MANAGER Wolf Quintero CAME UP AND SAID ""OH, THEY ARE BRINGING THE HOOD BACK TO PLACE ON THE CAR BECAUSE IT HAD HAIL DAMAGE. SO IF YOU COULD GO EAT AND COME BACK....""   I ASKED HIM WHY IT WASN'T DISCLOSED AT FIRST.  ""WELL WE WERE GOING TO FIX IT, NOT JUST SEND YOU OUT WITH HAIL DAMAGE.""  I THEN ASKED HIM WAS THAT THE ONLY PLACE?  HE THEN HE SAID, ""WELL, NO, THERE'S ALSO SOME ON THE ROOF OF THE CAR.""  I WONDER WHY HE DIDN'T DISCLOSE THAT AS WELL WITHOUT ME HAVING TO DIG DEEPER.  I TOLD HIM IT WASN'T SHOWING ON CARFAX...HE SAID ""WELL THAT'S CARFAX'S FAULT.""  I SAID NO, IT'S YOUR FAULT BECAUSE YOU OWN THE VEHICLE AND COULD HAVE TOLD THIS TO ME 2 DAYS AGO BEFORE I TOOK OFF WORK AND BROUGHT MY CHILDREN 45MILES HERE TO SEE THE CAR.  HE JUST SHRUGGED HIS SHOULDERS.  WHAT I THOUGHT WAS FUNNY THOUGH WAS THEY WERE TRAINING A NEW SALESMAN BUT IMMEDIATELY PULLED HIM BACK AWAY TO ANOTHER AREA WHEN THEY SAW THIS GOING SOUTH, AND MAYBE DIDN'T WANT HIM TO SEE THE BAIT AND SWITCH THEY WERE PLAYING.  I TOLD WOLF, THE MANAGER, IF I COULDN'T TRUST THEM WITH THIS, THEN I COULDN'T TRUST THEM WITH THE REST!!!  MY TWO KIDS SAW THIS WHOLE EXPERIENCE AND SAW WHY A LOT OF PEOPLE, INCLUDING MYSELF, HATE WITH A PASSION BUYING CARS BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE THIS, AND DEALERSHIPS LIKE THIS TRYING TO SCREW YOU OVER.

3,"July 07, 2019","The Honda CRV EX is Honda’s best-selling model. Due to its’ popularity, I was expecting a difficult sales negotiation process. After making contact with Nart Abzakh of AutoNation Honda Lewisville, it became clear I was wrong. Nart is a genuinely happy, transparent, honest, and direct person. My car purchase could not have gone any smoother and the out-the-door price was very competitive. Nart is the fifth star in my rating.

4,"June 08, 2019"," I began searching for my dream car the Honda Civic Type R, contacting dealerships through USAA. The salesman from Autonation Honda Lewisville Taylor was kind and invited me in to talk about the vehicle. I arrived to Autonation Honda Lewisville for preliminary talks. Negotiations started off fine. The facility itself was decently taken care of other than the bathroom having urine all over the floor. We got a decent deal on the car then we began filling out credit apps and having our credits pulled. My wife, also my anonymous would be co-signer and myself all applied because they needed all of us to see which one would get approved. We found this odd. Following I put a security deposit on the car after we got approved. Afterwards we waited for the vehicle to arrive as a brand new Sonic gray pearl Type R was in transit, the exact color I wanted. In the meantime they asked for a few things and I provided. Where things turned is when my would be co signer and wife got their credit pulled three separate times by Autonation Honda. My wife didn’t even sign on the car, yet they pulled her credit multiple times. We were outraged but we had already pulled the trigger on the deal. They stated that different lenders need to pull it, however my would be co-signer has purchased a lot of cars and this has never happened to him. Also the name on the lender who pulled his credit was Honda financing .Ultimately my anonymous co signer and I signed for the car. When the car arrived we sat down to sign papers, my family sat down with the finance guy Dan. Dan was fine at the beginning however then when speaking about the warranties he started making unprofessional remarks whilst my wife and I were discussing which warranties to add. Dan made remarks about how my wife and I were “a young family and just moved to texas.” His opinion was uncalled for, my family thought these remarks were very unprofessional, rude and no way to speak to your customers. In continuation, in regards to the warranties,  he states if i were to place an aftermarket turbo for example into my car and something went wrong he would fix the things around it with one of the several warranties I added to my purchase. Dan also told me that I was the primary owner on the car but had me put my signature under the co-owner and the loan was therefore not in my name. Dan was very shady and my family question his credibility. fterwards when picking up the car, I was absolutely enraged seeing that this dealership drilled the two holes for the front license plate into the front bumper of my 40,000+ car. I spoke to the Sales Manager Austin a few days later as I was trying to get over it however, he states that this is the law and that Honda requires this. Austin states that the car cannot leave the lot without it. I asserted to Austin , they should’ve relayed to me they were going to drill holes prior to buying the car as I am new to a state that requires front plates. Austin then states they wouldn’t have thought of doing that. The dealership doesn’t understand that there are other ways to mount a front plate than drilling holes into someone’s vehicle. Let alone their most expensive vehicle. Once again I question the credibility of this shady dealership. The whole purchase was a nightmare and I am scared to return to the dealership period let alone to have my vehicle serviced in the future. I DO NOT recommend ANYONE to buy a car from this dealership. Very shady and unprofessional. ",1.0
5,"June 05, 2019","Foreword to the novel: The L in EX-L stands for “leather.”

The wife and I saw a very reasonably priced Honda Fit for sale and decided that we would drive two hours to see and hopefully buy the car. This vehicle was advertised as EX-L and having leather seats. Since we noticed that there were not any pictures of the back seat, and the pictures availed seemed to show a cloth interior (pictures can be deceiving) we made sure to call ahead and ensure that the seats were leather and we also specifically asked if there were any tears or stains in the back seat, informing them we were driving two hours to view it. They assured us that, being an EX-L, the seats were leather and there were no stains and there was no damage to the car.

I can get over the multitude of scratches, paint chips, and the various exterior stains that could be cleaned as these are minor issues.

What I could not get over was that there was hail damage to the roof as well as...

cloth seats... that featured...

a stain in the back seat...

that we specifically called ahead and asked about (before driving two hours there and back). The salesman gave a “hmm..” and continued to try to sell us the car as well others, but I saw all of this as a sign not to trust and do business with them.",1.0
6,"January 02, 2019","Drove 50 miles one way to take a look at a reasonably priced suv for my daughter. No indication of hail damage listed on the description, nor could it be seen in the photos and no mention from Omar before we made the trip. 

This wasn’t some slight damage here and there. The car would be a total loss if turned into the insurance company. I’ve seen cars at auctions with less hail damage being sold for pennies on the dollar and this big name dealership is actually trying to see this a clean pre owned vehicle. 

I was absolutely disgusted and will never do business with any AutoNation ever!",1.0

8,"November 30, 2018",Never visit this place. Customer service is way poor. I had simple question about audio code: and I call services and talk to Joe. Joe make me feel like it's too much for me to ask for help and rude as xxxx. He even made the comment as I answer my own question without let me finished talking. I ask for manager and she is same as joe poor customer service. Instead of listening my question she just ask me what type of car I have.. I guess this is the type of customer service are being trained and accepted only at this location. Very disappointed.  Never visit this location again.. ,1.0
9,"August 16, 2018","Went there on a Saturday to look at a car which was on their website while I was there. The rep I met with was Ahmed - be wary of this person, deceitful and cheating. I would have been ok if the deal wouldn't have worked out. What bothered me was having to spend 2 hours and him making all kinds of excuses why he couldn't show me the course, and trying to sell me something I didn't want.",2.0

And why do they always want to call and talk to me right after I leave? If I was looking for an apartment to rent, would I get my credit history checked first, before given the price?

11,"January 31, 2018","I live in NYS and was trying to help my granddaughter who lives in Dallas find a reliable used car.  We went thru the listings on the internet, decided on the ones we wanted to test drive and called and set up an appointment.  When my granddaughter showed up they had her drive totally different cars.  When I called to ask what was going on I was told one of the ones we were interested in had been sold while she was there and the other one wasn’t ready to be test driven.  then thy called back and said it was there and again when she went they had her drive a different car.  Excuse again was that the car wasn’t ready to be test driven and they also had a different sales person work with her although we had both spoken with the original salesman that day and he was going to show it to her.  
When I again asked what was going on the salesman emailed us pictures showing extensive body work being done on the car.  The Carfax report they provided for this car stated the car had NOT been in any accidents and had no other problems.  Hmm!  Who’s lying here?  

I wouldn’t buy a flea from this dealership.  Found them very dishonest, annoying and underhanded.  Worse customer service I’ve ever had at a car dealership.  Save your time and avoid this place.",1.0

13,"January 10, 2018","Bought my new Honda Civic from here (great experience with that) but called them because my tire pressure gauge kept coming on and I thought it was malfunctioning. Called and dealership said they could reset it in 5 minutes. This was during a workday but I had already checked and filled tire pressure for a few days so I wanted to fix this.

When I arrived it was pretty empty but no one came to greet me. I had to meander into the service area and grab someone sitting at a computer doing nothing in particular. He came out and inspected the tire and we found a nail that he said needed to be replaced. He quoted the cost and I told him I had a work meeting in 2 hours could it be done. He said yes they weren't busy so I gave the green light.

It took over 3 1/2 hours to complete the job. As I complained and said I have to go I kept getting ""its in the shop being worked on right now"". For hours. I had to cancel my meeting (and the following one) which cost me money as I own my own business. I never got an explanation or reason for the extraordinary wait.

I used the website chat the next day to talk to someone to leave a complaint (not looking for anything just wanted to let the owners/management know) and the chat desk representative took down all my information and told me they would reach out which they never did.

This is unacceptable customer service all around and I will never have my cars serviced here again. Reading other reviews with similar ""it's being worked on"" I believe there is a systemic problem with the service department. Avoid it.",2.0

It didn't, told to buy gas cap. 2 days after gas cap purchase engine light still on. Took car back and had to ask for rental. 2 days later after hearing nothing Lester said they couldn't fix we would have to take to Kia. Picked up car to take to KIA. Next day called 7 times to ask for rental, kept being placed on hold (later find out Lester was not there) and never called back. Mike Bright called back after receptionist was cursed out. Asked for money back. Mike said he started 3 days ago to ""fix"" the place. Found out the car had been in dealership day before we purchased and it was never looked at even though they claimed it was certified. He took car back again we received a rental without asking. Mike was great.  Returned to pick up car and noted several places the car had been damaged while in their care.  Took car home 2 days later the battery died.  10.6 voltage would not charge.

17,"April 24, 2017","This by far is the worst Honda dealership and Honda service shop that I stepped into. The customer service is horrendous, the sales reps and the service mangers are so frustrating. I parked my car into the garage and no one has come to me l, i saw two service managers just talking and I had to go to them to get their attention.  Service drive manger Christine Phan helped me but as soon as I informed her about my warranty I had with the car, she started to give me a ugly face and treated me even worse.I went in there because my check engine light came on. I waited for 4 hours and no one even called me or anything. To me, the shop was not as busy because i got there around 9:30 am.  I waited and I couldn't wait any longer because of work. So I asked her co worker, Joe Sims, to get Christine so i can leave and he just stared and sighed and called for her. Its really frustrating how ignorant these managers can be. Finally Spoke with Christine and asked for my car. She brought my car back and she didn't even tell me and just walked away without even a small apology for the long wait. She is by far the worst service advisor I ever experienced. I bought 3 cars from this same dealership and a very loyal customer to here. Im ashamed of how crappy this service is to be honest. Please avoid the service here, Especially Christine Phan-Shultz and Joe Sims.",1.0
18,"April 04, 2017","Car is fine. Took 3 hours from start to finish, and we were paying cash for our car. Totally, completely unwilling to work with us on price. Salesman stated, ""well, we have to make money you know."" 

Things I care about when shopping for a car:
1) Car value
2) Efficiency in buying process

I could care less for fancy facilities and people dressed in suits wearing nice watches. I don't care that they're a mega car dealer or have useless frills. I want a car a good value, and the buying process to be efficient. The car we bought, I know we overpaid for. By $1000, based on valuations from several sources. They were completely unwilling to work with us on price. And the entire process took 3 hours. We went through the deal because the car was very nice, and was exactly what we wanted, just overpriced. Will most likely not use them again for our next car purchase. ",3.0

I recently took car in for the airbag recall and while it was raised up, the tech advised me that the front bumper had been repainted and said it was a poor job. The car also has some heavy scratches on the driver's door that were touched up when I purchased the car.

21,"January 04, 2017","When I made my appointment I was very specific in asking about how long the oil change would take. 
Oil change is certainly not a detailed process so I was quoted an hour maximum. This place does NOT offer a loaner vehicle while you wait they make you ""rent a car"" from them if you want one.
I was on time for my appointment but after one hour there seemed to be no effort to contact me as to the status of my car so I went to ask. I was told it was taking a little longer.  asked why as it was just an oil change. No real answer given. 15 minutes later I asked again. He said , ""what do you want me to do""... I said"" get me my car please"". I had another engagement I had bought tickets for to attend with my daughter who was home from college and did not want to be late.
 15 minutes later again I frantically asked him to just get me my car. He said ok it is in the garage ready BUT he still did not have my paperwork ready for me to pay/check out.... He hen had to see his service manager because I had a coupon and the manager needed to approve it. Ughh, that seriously took another 7 minutes to get done before I could finally pay for and leave with my vehicle.

Our family eagerly drove over to the dealer after work. Everything seemed fine at first. We were greeted warmly, shown the car, features were explained, and off went the salesman to get the pricing ready. Guess how much the OTD price was on the pricing sheet - $1000 more than what I thought we went to purchase the car for. I called the BS and got up to walk out.

28,"December 13, 2015","Very disappointed in this place, just purchased today12/12/2015 a 2011 Chevy Cruze, they had on sell, test drove it, seemed to run ok, and was treated very well by the sales person, Raghu and finance Manager Johnny Marquez they did an awesome job! however the vehicle did not turn out as i would have liked, got home on a short drive to Little Elm, ENGINE LIGHT goes on, I call Raghu and he says to check the gas cap, since he filled it up it might be loose, and it was already late, so I told him if that did not work I would see him on Monday since they close on Sunday. Since the check engine light was on, I decided to take it to O'Reilly auto parts to run a free diagnostic, the tech there gets 2 hits and he says, you have several misfires on the engine, and the Turbo on the car is not working properly, so that being said, this tells me that this dealership does not run the whatever point inspection they say they do, or this would have been caught, took the O'Reilly Autoparts guy 2 minutes to figure this out (2 MINUTES!) This car is going back on Monday 12/14/2015!! Can not trust the people in-charge of making sure the inspections are done on their vehicles. I would be weary of their repair people as well.

29,"December 02, 2015","Recently purchased a 2009 Honda Civic from them.  Car drove fine and the salespeople were friendly, but the customer service after the sale was HORRENDOUS!

After driving the car for a few days, we noticed a couple of issues.  The gas cap was missing, an interior light was not working, and the battery cables were corroded.  On top of that, we were not given the registration paperwork.  Then, the starter died!

It was obvious that the car had not been put through their ""inspection process"", so I took (towed) the car back to AutoNation Honda Lewisville under the ""3 day car return guarantee"" program.  At first they tried to tell me that the 3 days had expired, when in fact, it had not.  I purchased the car on Friday, December 27th, and returned it on Monday, December 30th.  My sales person and his manager promised me that they would fix the starter, replace the gas cap, fix the interior lights, and run the car through the ""inspection process"" again to give me peace of mind.

Instead of just returning the car like I should have, I took their word that these issues would be resolved and kept the car.  What a mistake on my part.  We picked up the car this morning and the starter was fixed (at least the car started up - they could not provide documentation that the starter was actually fixed).  Also, no documentation was provided that another inspection was done.  No one could find the registration!  While driving back from the dealership. the check engine light came on.  Guess what, the gas cap is still missing!  The interior light is still not working, so they obviously DID NOT run it through the inspection process like they promised.

From the start of the process Martin provided me First class 5 star service, he helped me via email and text to answer any questions I had even before I reached the dealership. Once I arrived he helped me find the Accord I wanted within a few minutes and helped me to negotiate the deal. Martin should be a role model leader sales consultant to the whole dealership I was very pleased with the whole sales process, he even took the time to explain how the car worked and even offered to help me afterwards as well with any follow-up questions or concerns. I was very lucky to work with Martin a very friendly and professional sales consultant who listened to what I wanted and took the time to help me.

I would also like to thank Randy Giles and Tonie Welker, both very professional and friendly and quickly worked with me to complete the financing paperwork.

There were no ""games"" back and forth. We negotiated a great price for my trade and the new vehicle we wanted to purchase. We were given a Smart Choice price from my initial contact with Jocelyn. This price was hard to beat by other dealerships and I was told by other dealerships the deal  ""would not happen"". They were wrong. 

Masoud and AutoNation worked extremely hard to find the car my wife and I were looking for. A white on black 2013 Honda Touring 2wd. Unfortunately, they could not locate one that was not a demo. It was like trying to find a Unicorn. They tried very hard to put us in the car we wanted. So my wife and I compromised on the interior and went with a light grey interior (which we are glad we switched, we love the color combo). 

Masoud and AutoNation made the whole deal seamless and stress free. Masoud took care of everything in regards to the deal. Masoud even waited after hours for me. Masoud was in constant communication with me and everyday updates were given. 

Financing was a breeze - Jae made the process stress free..

New Car Sales Manager, Randy- was extremely nice and inviting. 

Overall - if you want to save yourself the headache of negotiating and going through the car buying process. See AutoNation first and ask for Masoud!

39,"October 16, 2013","The service and repair department at AutoNation in Lewisville cost me money that was unnecessary and at the same time put my wife and daughter's life in danger. . Here is our scenario: 

Back in July, my wife took our Honda Civic to AutoNation Honda in Lewisville, TX. She had heard some loud noise coming from under the hood. They looked at it and stated the tires were wearing unevenly and that we needed new tires. We proceeded to go get tires for the car which cost over $300 but the noise could still be heard. We took it back to the dealer a couple of days later for a second time and miraculously, they found a problem with the CV joints. They supposedly fixed the issue at that time but did not offer any condolences or credit for the tire cost. At this point, we were disappointed that we spent money that was not necessary but at least we thought the car was fixed because the noise had stopped. Well, we were wrong.... This past weekend, my wife was driving the car with our 4 year old daughter and my wife said it felt like the front right tire was about to fall off. She stopped at the first place she could find which was a Valvoline shop and they were nice enough to take a look at it for her. They put it up on a jack and said the tire was fine but the mechanic that did the CV joint was an idiot and had no business working on cars. He used a regular nut instead of a castle nut and he failed to put a pin in it as well. He stated that the nut that was on there had come loose and was a half of turn from coming off all together. in his words, if that would have happened, my wife would have lost complete control of the car and no telling what would have happened to her and my daughter. He tightened it for us and wrote us a letter to provide to the dealer that explained what was wrong in his opinion. I took it back to the dealer for the 3rd time. I spoke with Chuck, the service manager, and after another inspection, he agreed the mechanic did indeed use the wrong nut and did not put a pin in it. Chuck admitted it was their mistake.  

My wife and I have lost complete trust in the Honda dealership and the vehicle. How can we trust that it is fixed this correctly this time? How do I know my wife will not lose control of the vehicle at any time??? We asked the service manager for an extended warranty or something for our trouble and for the money we had to spend for their mistake and  he offered us $100 credit at their store! What a joke! I have spent 15 to 20 hours away from work trying to get this fixed, spent over $300 on tires that were not needed and now have a wife that is afraid to drive her car. I am very thankful that my wife stopped by the Valvoline shop that morning! I am also thankful and I am sure you are as well that I am not contacting you to inform you that my wife was in an accident due to your mechanic’s mistake.

41,"March 20, 2013","Bought a corvette with 49k miles from bankston nissan 10/2012 2 monthes later all the paint on the rear of the car bubbled up very bad , car had a CLEAR CARFAX .... But i did not think anything of it , but the car had been repainted because you could see all of the overspray on the inside fenderwell , estimate to have repaired was $3000 to $4000 .

2/2013 bought a 2008 accord with 80k miles from bankston lewisville ( Autonation ) ... CLEAR CARFAX Again .... took the car to the shop where i work and find out the driver door had a lot of damage and was repaired and repainted and the body work was very bad ..... so i took the car back the same day and swapped it for another car , that i am happy with !!!

3/2013 Bought a 2008 accord for my daughter paid $17000.00 which is nada CLEAN retail price !! ... Did not get a chance to look at the car because my daughter was busy , checked it out a week later .... Guess what ... NOT THIS CAR ALSO HAD A CLEAR CARFAX !!! ... This car has damage all over it ... the whole right rear of the car had been completely repainted and it did not even come close to matching the original paint .... the whole front end of the car has been repainted and it looks really bad , the driver front fender looks like somebody took a cheese grater to it .... Looks like the car was painted with spray paint !!! ... The first car i bought with damage i did not think anything about it , the second car i bought i didn't really think anything about it because they had no problem putting me in another car so no big deal !! 

Well now with this car im thinking something is not right about this dealership ... the whole autonation company !!

My wife called the dealer and told the salesman about the damage he let her talk to the bodyshop manager who told my wife that they did the repairs there at autonation honda !!! ... Are you serious ??? ... Why did they they not report the damage on the carfax , i think they also did the repairs on the other cars also but i don't have proof of that !! ... But how can a multimillion dollar dealership get away with not reporting to carfax when they repair damage on a car ??? ... We were told to bring the car back and they would make it right !!! 

Well i drove to lewisville honda which is about a 30 minute drive from my house and when i told the salesman that i was bringing the car in for the damage to be taken care of he said well i need to see what we can do because we found out that we told you the wrong information , on that car we actually did not do any repairs !!!! .... Are you serious ??? ... Now all of a sudden they change there mind and say they didn't fix the car !!! ... Hmmm ..... sounds like the body shop manager said something that he wasn't suppose too !!! 

So now i guess i'm pretty much screwed , but i just wanna pass on the word to keep somebody else from getting screwed !!! ",1.8
42,"February 01, 2013","Needed a used van and Odyssey was it for my family.  I listened to the different ratings and refused to go to Bankston Lewisville.  Instead, I went to Frisco, where every van we had seen online seemed to have been sold before getting there.  Then we went out to McKinney, guy talked us into buying a car before even seeing it and having it shipped.  We got all the paperwork signed and financing approved.  Next day we get a call from McKinney that, that car had been sold!  At this point we kind of had it and almost turned away from Honda altogether.  By the time my husband got home from work it was late and our only choice was to go see the Honda dealer in Lewisville, Bankston.  We got there 15minutes prior to closing, sales guys were gone but one of the managers were there.  Bobby sat down with us and gave us the carfaxes for two possibilities.  A couple of days later I went in for a test drive and loved Kim and his knowledge of the vehicle.  I told him that I liked the car and my husband would be in after work to also look at it.  Kim told me he wouldn't be there and introduced me to Paul, who would show us the car in the evening.  After my husband got home, we headed over there and a sense of panic took over when I did not see the van alongside the other used cars that were up for sale.  Immediately the thought, ""not again!"" came into my head.  Turns out that Kim had put a ""sold"" sign on the car.  Seems like he trusted me as much as I trusted him.  The finance people were very upfront and told us that they couldn't match our credit union rate, so we financed through the credit union.  We drove the van home that night even though we didn't have the credit union stuff finished until the next day.  I was thrilled by the service and help my family and I received!  I never once felt overwhelmed by salesmen lingo.  Did we get the best deal?  Well, you always think you could've done better.  There is a mat missing, but you can't expect perfect on a 2008, 84K miles vehicle.  Besides, Kim said he would do his best to find me one and that's all I can ask for. I did not let my positive experience cloud my judgement and I took the car to a mechanic within the 3-day return policy.  The mechanic said, ""you got yourself a really good car there.""  Enough said!  :)",4.8

44,"December 14, 2012","Let me start. This is the WORST EXPERIENCE I HAVE EVER HAD AT A DEALERSHIP.  The most horrible service, the most horrible attitudes, and to be brushed off..wow.  

We started our trek for a used car that we would be able to use for several years.  We were looking in the lower price range, and we understood what type of vehicle we were looking for as far as miles and use.  We had an appointment with one person, after US calling THEM several times because apparently they dont respond to the internet inquiries. We were having to pusue them.  We finally did talk to someone, some manager that would give us a ""great"" deal.  So, we set an appointment for the same day.  Then 30 minutes before we are to be there at our ""appointment"" time, we are called and asked if we could come in the next day, why you ask? Oh, because they were with another customer...what? theres only one person??  We agreed because we were told that the car would be ready for us to drive when we got there ther next day.  We get there the next day, and its the wrong car, and not only the wrong car, but over our price range by a couple of thousand of dollars.  When asked where the car was that we were interested in, after much to-do and research, magically it was not at that lot, even though it stated it was.  It was in ""the shop getting fixed"" at the dealership across the highway.  We left disaapointed but with a promise for a call early the next morning with a reason the car was in the shop.  Early morning to me, means before 2:00pm, in which again, I had to pursue them.  I was told the person we were working with was not even working that day, and had tyo go through the whole process again - but he promised he would call for us.  Now, because he did what he said he was going to do, I have respect for Jim.  He did call back, but this time the excuse was ""the managers were in a meeting"" so he couldnt find out what we needed to know.  He promised to call back.  Which he did.  The car was just being made ready to go on the lot for sale.  He even went across the street and test drove it and another car we were looking at.  He was honest enough to tell us that the one car was horrible, and not to waste our time, in fact he turned it back into the service manager and told them.  But he did like the other car.  We had an appointment to come out and test drive it.  Finally.  We went to the dealership, and as promised, we were taken over to the neighboring dealership.  As we were pulling in we saw the car we wanted, all pretty, and clean and freshly washed.  As we got out to get the keys, we were informed that the car was going to the front because someone else just bought it. After several conversations, Jim said there was another car like the one that we wanted.  We did test drive it, and it had a few driving issues that concerned us, and was ""mislabeled"" for the price.  Before we decided to buy it, we agreed to go back to the dealership to see if Bobby could give us a ""deal"".  What a freaking JOKE... Deal?  My tushi.  

Now, First of all, we never talked to Bobby, he never came and greeted us, introduced himself, and much less never apologized for all our running around and inconveience.  xxxxxx.  I have never been so detached from a car salesman ""manager"" ever.  The three cars we had as our ""great deals"" were a joke.  One had over 200K miles, the other one had 3 thread bare tires, and once they replaced them, they would not be able to give us the same deal, and the other car, was nowhere to be found.  You kidding me???  When we were leaving our salesman told Bobby, who was walking towards us that we were not interested in the deal, and we thought he was finally coming to talk to us, but instead he strutted beyond us, shrugged his shoulders and said, ""ok"".  Never in all my years of buying a car, have I ever been so peeved at a lack of professionalsm, a lack of interest, or a genuine lack of respect towards a customer.  We are not high maintenannce customers, and we werent the ""big ticket"" item of a new car, but customer service is still custromer service.  If you dont want to be bothered with just any other customers but new car deals, then get the used cars of your lots, because last I checked, it is still a sale. 

In all fairness, Jim did the very best he could with the hand he was being dealt. We have no issue with him. Bobby, was an absolute tool for never even acknowledging us on a personal level, or even giving us the respect as a customer.  I will be writing this same review everywhere. And when we do buy a new car in a year, we will NEVER COME HERE...

48,"June 20, 2012","My husband and I bought our first car from a dealership here and had a great experience. He knew exactly what car he wanted and the financing department went above and beyond to help him get into the car even though he didn't have long enough credit history. We had great service with getting the tags and everything after the purchase as well. It didn't feel like a dealership that stops caring once they have your money.

My husband and my purchase was in April 2010 and since we had such great service I took a friend there when she was in need of a car. Unlike my husband she wasn't sure exactly what she was looking for and the sales person wasn't pushy and gave honest advice on what was and wasn't a great deal. Another sales person came over with a car from another dealership that fit her needs and they got us set up for a test drive and she loved the car. She needed it immediately and they gave her top notch service with getting the financing set up. The sales person was running back and forth doing whatever he could to make her financing work since she had literally zero credit.

We ran into an issue with picking up the car because she needed to pick up money from the bank and get proof of insurance for her new car. She didn't have a way to get to the dealership so the sales person actually came to my house where she was staying and picked her up the next day even though it was out of his way just to make sure she could get the car.

Unrelated, Other small complaints about bankston is that their service is a little expensive, however lower than other honda dealerships. One thing to consider if you're buying a used car is the option to have extended warrenty. Honda only offers a certain kind of warrenty at the time of purchase.

61,"July 16, 2009","My 2002 Honda Accord SE just hit 105K miles.  I was looking for a good price on the timing belt service.  I called most of the dealers in North Texas and found Bankston to be cheapest among all.  Honda Cars of McKinney quoted me about $1200 for this service.  I also wanted to get my transmission serviced which was an additional $99.  I had a 20% off coupon from them so it would bring the price down to $1040 plus tax and shop supplies.  I called them again the next day and they quoted me $1100 for exact same service.  Called the third time and they quoted me $1400.  At this time, I was frustrated and decided not to take my car to them because they were unreliable.
I called Ruth Riley, David McDavid and Bankston.  All of them quoted somewhere between $1000 and $1200 for this service.  Please note that I am not only getting the timing belt changed but also changing all belts, balancer belts, seals, water pump etc. etc plus transmission flush.  All said they will accept other Honda dealers coupon but when they heard 20% off, they backed out.  They were only willing to honor up to 10%.  

Anyway, Bankston was cheapest of them all so I called them again to confirm that the price they quoted me is correct and they were.  The only difference this time is that they said they will accept 20% off coupon from Honda Cars of McKinney.  I went down there and asked the service rep to give me a final quote in writing.  He made an invoice for $846 after 20% off and taxes etc.   I left my car there.  I did get a call from him saying that I need brake oil and power steering oil flushed which was an additional $200 which I declined.  He also told me that I need a new air and cabin filter..additional $100 which I declined.  I also needed alignment but my tires hardly have $5000 miles on them so I’ll pass on that too.  Anyway, he said that in that case, my car is ready and I should come pick it up.  When I got there, my TOTAL invoice was for $799.  I saw a charge for $10 misc. fees but I did not question it as I was saving $47 by not showing the invoice he printed before I dropped my car off.
Anyway, I am very happy with the overall quality of work so far.  The car feels like it did when I bought it new.  I would recommend this dealership to anybody who lives in North Texas area.  The only bad thing is, they don’t have loaner cars but they do have rental facility on premises and will probably share the rental cost with you.  I didn’t ask for it so I can’t tell.

I had been speaking to about 6 different Honda dealerships, and Chelsea was the only person who called to check in with me- and was the only person to find the exact vehicle I wanted after several other Honda dealerships told me that ""that vehicle doesn't exist,"" or ""you need to choose different colors/options.""  

After she found it, I went to the dealership and she directed me to Scott Pruettiangkura to further discuss the sale.  Scott was very knowledgeable and friendly.  I was very nervous before going to the dealership to buy the vehicle because this was my first time to buy a brand new car by myself.  However, I had just graduated college and been hired as a teacher so I qualified for Honda's recent college graduate program.  This gave me a 5.99% interest rate and 90 day payment deferment.  Scott also gave me a great price on the car.  I was trading in a 2002 Honda Civic, and got a good amount for my trade.  We completed the deal and I was told the vehicle would be in the next week.  The next day, Scott called and said the vehicle was no longer available because the other dealership had sold the vehicle.  However, after checking with me, he immediately ordered a new one to be built and it arrived at the dealership after about 2 weeks.   

After it arrived, I went to the dealership and completed the sale.  The car had 3 miles when it was given to me.  Scott spent a lot of time showing me all of the different features and answering all of my questions.  Even after the sale, I have emailed Scott with different questions and he has been very prompt and helpful with his reponses.  I love my Element, and am very glad I chose Bankston Honda.  If you go to this dealership, ask for Chelsea or Scott and you will be well taken care of.  ",5.0
63,"August 01, 2008","Even though the car was ""certified"" after the sale we found undisclosed hail damagage they refused to fix and it was in the shop within a week because the air conditioner went out. I was very displeased with the overall experience and feel as though they pull one over on us by saying the car had been certified after receiving a 150 point inspection.",2.2
64,"April 23, 2008","I do not recommend this dealership for service and hence Sales. They picked me up from my home which is 15 miles from the dealership during the initial sales. Later during a recall inspection, they refused to provide me a transporation (Shuttle service) and said it is available only in 10 miles radius. It is so riduculous.",2.2
65,"May 30, 2007","The salesperson was so rude!  He was very impatient and did not provide information about the car unless I asked for it.  I felt rushed to make a decision.  He was annoyed when I asked to see the car again.  When I picked up the car the next morning, he still acted irritated.  I'm dismayed that any business will allow someone like that to represent it.",1.3
66,"March 26, 2007","I conducted my buying experience online and over the phone and got a great deal on a new 2007 Civic EX. Bankston's price beat several other Honda dealers in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. (that includes only the dealers that responded by email - all have web sites that claim to respond to emails, but I found that of 8 dealers contacted, only 4 responded)
When I went to the dealership to purchase the car, the entire process took about one hour and they didn't pester me about buying a bunch of additional options or packages.
As with conducting business with any dealership, do your research and know current prices, including pricing of options, and always be specific in your questions. Thoroughly read the dealer's email responses to make sure neither party is making any assumptions and print copies of the emails to take with you when going to any dealerships.",4.0
67,"February 18, 2006","Leased '06 S2000 Jan 6th after trading in '02 S2000.  Took them over a month to pay off trade-in's loan.  They still have not provided my plates and registration after 6 weeks, and they have not returned a check they did not cash after 6 weeks.  The management never returns phone calls- had to call American Honda to get them to call me back.",1.5
68,"May 26, 2005","Went in for a noise problem but also for a transmission replacement. Tranny was making a whining noise. Waited a week and picked it up. Noticed new rattling noise from the car while driving home and took it back. Waited for an hour or more and then was told that the transmission they JUST put in was defective and that they need to put in a new one!! Also they rotated my tires but i I had just put on new tires on the front but they moved them to back so I told them to re-rotate them to have my new tires on the front. Left and waited another week and came back to pick the car up. Transmission seemed fine but noticed they failed to re-rotate tires even though I asked the service advisor if they had done it minutes before walking to my car, but I guess he misunderstood what I meant. So I waited again for about 15min. Finally took it home and checked the car and found that the transmission oil level was very low so took it back. Noticed transmission jerks slightly from full stop to moving but for now, we will live with it and hopefully its just a minor prob/characteristic. Honda extended the warranty for automatic transmissions for 6yrs/100k according to our service advisor.Bankston did cover cost for rental while my car was in. Service Advisors are very friendly but the actual tech/mechanics can't be counted upon at ALL. Would not go back to dealership for service.This is my 4th tranny in 3 years. All  3 transmission replacements were done at bankston honda. Getting 2 new trannys within 2 weeks is rather disturbing for Honda reliability.",2.5
