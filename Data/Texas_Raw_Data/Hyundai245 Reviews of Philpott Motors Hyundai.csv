He always makes sure to understand my car's needs from my perspective and stays in touch to let you know if something has changed or a part needed to be ordered and lets you know as soon as it comes in. You can't ask for more than that. ,5.0
5,"April 13, 2020","We enjoyed the entire experience from walking up on the lot as a casual, possibly interested customer to driving off the lot with a beautiful new car, sold at a fair price, with a full tank if gas and pristine interior and exterior--after an excellent review of the functions, buttons and options from our salesman.  I've long been a fan of Philpott and its team, and they have just gotten better over the years. Looking forward to continuing this relationship.  Nancy Beaulieu

Philpott was our first stop on our quest for looking a new vehicles.  We met Joe in the parking-lot and he carefully discussed the 2017 Tucson SE Plus features inside and out. We did our homework before we got there and realized this vehicle was well worth a test drive.

85,"May 26, 2017","Jason Simon was my salesperson. He was very respectful and courteous. On the test drive, he was not overly talkative (like many salespeople tend to be) which allowed me to hear how the car sounded during various road conditions, and unfer acceleration and braking. He was attentive to my needs and those of my wife who was with me to help check out the vehicle. Jason was also very patient in letting me drive several vehicles to make sure of my final choice.    Jason made great effort to make sure everything was right after the sale. He contacted me to make sure I was still pleased with the vehicle and that everything was ok. He also contacted me once the license plates arrived. When my wife went to pick up the plates, he made sure to give my wife the valet key that he had found that I did not receive at vehicle delivery. I thought that was a true sign of great service as I did not realize the car came with a valet key and had not asked Jason about it.   The negotiation experience was professional and at no point did I feel the dealership was trying to take advantage of me. I got what I thought was a super price on the car. The finance experience was also very good. I was able to purchase GAP insurance and a Hyundai extended warranty at prices that made me feel like I got a great deal not only on the car, but an overall superb deal.   The entire purchasing process was very professional and everyone was respectful and courteous. Unfortunately, this is rare in the car businrss but it was most refreshing to experience it at Philpott Hyundai. I will definitely return for service and for future car purchases.",5.0

Just when I was beginning to lose hope of finding a reputable and respectful dealership, Kendall and Philpott saved the day!!!",5.0
89,"May 04, 2017","In my search to replace my vehicle, I had gone to numerous dealerships in and around Houston.  I cannot stress enough how much I dislike dealing with car salesmen, sales managers, and the like.  I decided to expand my search because I was not finding the exact car I wanted to buy and I stumbled on Philpott Hyundai.  Since I live about 2 hours away from the dealership, I contacted them through the website with an offer on one of the vehicles.  Jason responded immediately to let me know that he was taking my offer to his manager.  I called Jason to make sure we were on the same page regarding the offer and everything he said to me checked out.  I made an appointment to come in the next day, and when I arrived the vehicle was there waiting for me.  You shouldn't be amazed when people do what they say they will do, but I was.

97,"March 25, 2017","My experience with Philpott Hyundai far exceeded expectations. I actually bought a car from them about nine months prior to this purchase, so I knew when I needed another new one to call them. Craig went far behind the call of duty to make sure I got exactly the car I wanted with the least amount of hassle for me. He had my paperwork and car completely ready for me as soon as I could drive in from Houston (I drove two hours just to work with this dealership) and sat with me while I waited for finance to be ready. It was fast, friendly service, and pretty much unsurpassable by any other dealership in my opinion. Thank you Craig and Philpott Motors.",5.0

My vehicle has been in the service department for 7 days and they were unable to fix it. They did not want to replace the audio system because Hyundai engineers wanted to use my vehicle to learn how to rectify the problem. Nothing was done on my car the first 3 days because they didn't have a flash drive to use for the software. I left 2 flash drives on the front seat of the car when I brought it in, and told them they could use them. How incompetent can these people be?  Hyundai engineers are inconsiderate of the customer.

219,"September 09, 2015","Kendall my sales person was great, enjoyed my experience with him. But The finance office really didn't take the time to explain the services to me and was a little rude by trying to add extra fees and services I didn't want.  They tried to change the price that me and Kendall agreed to so be careful read all paper work. Btw this was my first new car purchase ever ! ",5.0

224,"August 29, 2015"," Justin Frederick did a great job in selling me my new 2016 Hyunai Elantra . Gave me the blue book price I asked for and the car note I wanted.  Spent about 1 hour and a half from start to finish,which is important to me because I work in the  afternoons Mon-Fridays. Never any pressure or tension spent with this salesman and no wasted time.  Did so well with my first deal that we came  back 10 days later and bought another one for my wife from Justin.Thanks to the Dealership manager for throwing in the free floor mats.  He was great too!  Same great deal as the first time and about 1 hour and 15 minutes this time. Both car payments for 5 years came to $454.00 combined :$232.00 for my car and #222.00 for my wifes. We loved both cars so much we will be back next summer to buy a new Accent for my son when he turns 16 next July.    Love the Service department and we keep out cars serviced there. Thanks to Otis and Sandra who keep our cars running and our time spent there to the minimum.  We have been Hyundai car owners since 2008 and we will be Philpot Hyundai owners for LIFE!",5.0

243,"September 18, 2012","I have recently purchased two new Hyundai's from Philpott. David Lithicum was such a good salesperson, I went back to him the second time. He was kind, courteous and very informative about the vehicles. The first purchase was very difficult for me as I had recently lost my husband and needed someone I felt I could trust to make me a fair deal and he did just that. The second purchase was as pleasant as the first. I needed an SUV for more car seat  room for my four grandchildren. David also impressed my friend who went with me the first time and she ended up buying a new vehicle for her daughter from  David as well. I will continue to recommend Philpott and David to my family and friends. Thanks to David Lithicum for a job well-done!",5.0
244,"May 04, 2012","Dealing with Chris Hofpaiur and the Philpott team was probably the best car buying experience that I have ever had.  They gave me a good price on the car that I bought, a decent trade in price and delivered my new car right to my driveway.

I have never dealt with a dealer who went this far out of the way to make a transaction smooth and simple.

I highly recommend Philpott Motors.",4.8
