0,"February 27, 2020","EXTREMELY unprofessional. Don't waste your time on any deals they try to throw at you.

I came in to get a quote on a lease for an Equinox. I made it very clear to the salesperson, Brandon, that I was not going to be making any decisions that day because I needed to discuss the details with my father, but I would be back later in the week. The salesperson made me extremely uncomfortable and basically forced me to stay and sign the lease that day, saying I will use their quote to go to another dealership and get a lower price.  I tried telling him multiple times I'm not certain about signing anything and I needed to leave, but he kept making me feel uncomfortable and guilty for leaving. Look, I've worked in sales. I understand that it's part of the job to get people to make a decision. Preying on a young female and making her uncomfortable when she clearly is there to just get information is NOT the way to go. I don't understand why he was wasting his time on me when my intentions were clear. He could have easily drawn up the quote, sent me on my way, and made another sale. 

Instead, I spent at least 3 hours working through the paperwork, still trying to back out of the deal. It got to the point I just couldn't argue anymore with this guy and there was no way I could get out, so for the price I was getting I just went along with the sale. Again, young female that doesn't do well with pressure. Sign the papers, he takes my GM discount number and asks for my SSN. I tried to whisper it as his office door was open and there were other customers in the dealership. He repeats my SSN out loud, basically calling out my identification for anyone to hear. Dealerships are normally supposed to make you fill out your SSN on a form, not say it out loud.

After standing around waiting for an eternity without even being offered a bottle of water or coffee until I was able to see the salesperson again, I was told that due to my current employment status I had to wait until the next day for approval from dealership management to allow me to complete the lease forms without a co-signer. However, this was communicated to me after the car was prepared for me and my boyfriend took a $30 uber to pick up my car so I could drive the new one home. 

On Monday I tried calling the salesperson to check in and see if the management approved my application. No answer. I get a call from a different number an hour or two later; however, I was busy at work and did not see the call. No voicemail was left so I had no idea of who was calling or why. Eventually, I call the number back and get directed to the salesperson. He says there's still no word from management. This telephone tag goes on throughout the week. The salesperson eventually calls at the end of the week and tells me I did not get approved and need a co-signer, which is a little ridiculous given I have proof of income and with how much time they spent with me (at the end of the month when incentives are ending and sales quotas need to be met) you would think they would be fine without the cosigning. 

I told the salesperson I *might* come by later, and it would be after 3 pm if so. However, my plans changed and I ended up going to another dealership that treated me much better, without pressuring me or guilt-tripping me. However, my GM discount number was locked by Classic Chevy. I called the salesperson I was dealing with and asked him to release the number. Instead of complying, he was trying to get me to come back to him to make a sale. At that point it was too late, so again I don't understand why he was wasting his time. Anyway, he says he will release the number and hangs up.

I received a call a couple of days later from the dealership asking if I was still going to make my appointment for that day. I told them I never made an appointment and had already bought from another dealership, but asked the person on the phone if they could remind the salesperson to unlock the number. She says she will and hangs up.

The discount number is still locked. I tried calling the salesperson again, no answer. So the next day I call the sales manager (at this point I am beyond pissed). No answer, so I left a voicemail. The next day, no call. I tried calling the GM at this point, no answer from the dealership. There must be some company culture here about not being responsive because for management to even be unresponsive is ridiculous. As someone with loyal connections to GM and the auto industry, I deserve to be treated with some respect. There is absolutely no professionalism at this dealership. If they expect to get me to come back in the future, they should have been willing to release my discount number and treated me as a client, not a piece of meat to make a sale off of. 

I will absolutely never step foot into this dealership again and I will tell all my friends and associates to avoid this dealership at all costs.",1.0
1,"February 18, 2019","Classic Chevy had contacted me around April 2018 regarding a vehicle and I did a test drive with one of their salesmen.  I decided to wait on buying. When I decided to purchase, I stopped at this dealership to do a 2nd test drive of the Chevy Equinox. That was 12/15/18.  This dealership had an Equinox in Kinetic Blue, with $17,998 in very large yellow numbers on the side of the vehicle.  The vehicle was up on a platform in the air so that everyone on the freeway could see it.  

Since the salesman that I dealt with in April had quit, in December I dealt with salesman, Sean Khwaja.  He said that Chevy was offering “Employee Pricing” on their vehicles, and this would drop the price even lower than the advertised $17,998.  I asked him to email me the following Monday with the price with the “Employee Pricing” discount.  

I did not hear from Mr. Khwaja, so on Tuesday, 12/19/18, I emailed him and asked him for the price with the ""Employee Pricing"" discount.    

Mr. Khwaja sent me a Purchase Agreement with a price of $24,953.22.   The advertised price of $17,998, that we had discussed, was not listed anywhere on the Purchase Agreement.   I told Mr. Khwaja that this was not the price that was advertised on the side of the vehicle.  

He said the $17,989 included rebates for things like Costco member, active military, National Realtors Assoc bonus cash, returning a lease, owner of a competitors vehicle, and USAA member bonus cash.  

I do not believe that Chevy’s available rebates added up to nearly $7,000.   Most of the offered rebates were only $500 each.  In addition, it is highly unlikely that any one person would qualify for every single one of the rebates.

I believe that advertising the price of this vehicle to the general public at $17,998 is deceptive pricing and/or false advertising since it includes rebates that they did not disclose when I was looking at the vehicle.  In addition, the dealership knows that it is unlikely that any person would qualify for every single one of the rebates they claim that they are deducting to come up with the $17,998 price.   

I told Mr. Khwaja that jacking up the price by $7,000 was false advertising.  He did not respond to that email.  ",1.4

3,"August 31, 2018",Just wasted 4 hours with Rohil who thinks he knows all there is about car sales but doesn’t.  Then after a deal approved by him and the used car sales manager gets sent to finance they reject it.  4 hours of my life lost. ,1.0

6,"June 09, 2018","If this guy is a salesman, the my dog will be an elite sales! We had an appointment with one of their online sales manager. When we walked in the showroom we were told the guy was not there, but he claimed he would be there in his email. Then this well dressed guy took care of us. I told him that we had a limited budget and we hope him showing us no matter LS or LT. this guy brought us the price of the LT as well as our trade in price which was ridiculously low! We told him we could not afford this one, then he asked us to telling him our prospective price. We told him a number we saw in the Cars.com which was the lowest price of a LS model. This guy hit the table with his palm heavily and said: it’s impossible to buy a LT with your price, good luck! We were shocked! We did telling him that we wanted to take a look at both the LT & LS! He pushed us to showing him our bottom line, but he did nothing for helping us finding a proper vehicle but laughing at us! I did not know how they trained this stupid guy. Our budget was not enough for a LS, but it’s enough for a traverse! Finally I guess this guy thought he was selling luxury vehicles, those people had low budgets did not worth his time and respect!",1.0

8,"October 24, 2017","Purchased my 2017 Chevrolet Silverado High Country from Maggie. Maggies smile, customer service and knowledge of trucks was top knotch. And she made the buying experience so simple. Not at all like previous pain staking buying experiences from past. If you are looking for a new vehicle, and more specifically, a new truck...go see Maggie.",5.0

11,"October 09, 2017","Worked with me on the price and payments. Very friendly and worked around my schedule. Made the experience fast and convenient. Only thing i would change is the credit check.

17,"September 27, 2017","After my horrible car accident I had to endure the loss of a totaled veichle. So I started my hunt for a new automobile. I visited several different dealerships who seem to all have the same goal ""make money and get them out the door."" They didn't want to hear about my loss and how I only had the weekend to choose a car. I decided instead of showing up at dealerships why not utilize the internet and research. Surely GREAT dealerships know how to promote their business. I came across Classic Chevrolet and they had two vehicles that I was interested in. JB was my salesman and if I may add.. I enjoyed working with JB. He made me feel like I was apart of their team. He kept me informed every step of the way. I appreciated his humble, smart, and witty personality. See...the key with JB is...it wasn't about just making a sale it was about me leaving happy and satisfied. ",5.0
18,"September 27, 2017","JB was more than patient and thorough with me, it was good vibes from the moment I walked in until the time I left. JB made the car buying experience seamless while I had my dad on the phone as my financial advisor all the way in St.Louis (lol) and was more than helpful with questions and concerns that we had. This is my first brand new car and I'm in love!",5.0

24,"August 21, 2017","I went to Joel Roger Classic Chevrolet in search of a new truck courtesy of my husband only to leave in utter disbelief of the lack of professionalism displayed by Daniel from Argentina. At first glance he could've passed for a service tech in his dingy short sleeve button up, stained jeans, and worn tennis shoes but despite his lack of care in his appearance I gave his salesmanship the benefit of the doubt. I was torn between a Silverado LTZ and the High Country while my husband wanted to purchase a Colorado for himself possibly on the same day if not later this week. Had it not been for Daniel's lack of product knowledge and professionalism we would have gladly purchased at least one vehicle today. Every question I asked about either truck he had to refer to the window sticker. When asked about available features he stated the truck had ""all the bells and whistles"". My husband asked ""so what does that entail?"" And Daniel replied ""all the whistles"". While funny in hindsight, it did not aid in our car buying process. We've purchased vehicles before and never had any problems. Daniel never invited us inside, had no idea where the vehicles were located on the lot and had us walking back and forth across the lot in the Texas heat. He asked us to wait outside while he went to grab keys to a truck and then proceeded to yell across the to get our attention and waved us over. Not sure if it was because we look young or we looked as though we were not able to buy today (I had jeans and a tank top while my husband wore his favorite jersey and shorts- nothing fancy but definitely appropriate for the 98 degree heat in the shade) but Daniel sure did not seem to want to sell us a car. He merely opened the vehicles for us to look and left it at that- probably because he knew nothing about the vehicle. No manager turn over. No trying to get the deal done. Nothing. We are already pre-approved through USAA and had our sizable down payment in cash. All I needed was to make a decision on which truck I wanted. If you LOOK under 35 DO NOT go here because no effort will be made to earn your business. ",1.0
25,"June 28, 2017",Customer service was great here! Minimal wait time and very attentive to my needs. I especially enjoyed RayGina's customer service. She made sure I left happy and was very detailed oriented. You don't find that level of service everyday so I do appreciate it! ,5.0
26,"October 27, 2016",Literally the most honest and fastest car purchasing experience I have ever encountered. No games. No hassle. No trying to sale us what we didn't want. Everything made perfect sense. The whole team was top notch! Thanks DK!!,5.0
27,"October 14, 2016",He was amazing and fast. He got me the car and I wanted and was extremely patient despite me being super indecisive. I would recommend anyone to get their car from him. ,5.0
28,"October 14, 2016","I was in the market for the an awesome truck with the best deal. I looked in San Antonio, did not find anything so I started looking in Houston. I called the dealership and starting working with DK. He listened to what I wanted and got to work finding the right price. He was very patient and made the process very easy. I will never go to any other dealership when buying my next truck. ",5.0
29,"October 14, 2016",Mr. Woodard was very helpful and understanding did exactly as promised. Living almost 300 miles away I was a bit skeptical but at the end I have zero regrets buying from a dealership far from home we finished all the process and had my vehicle delivered in less that 3 days after coming in contact with him. Would definitely look into purchasing from them again.,5.0
30,"September 09, 2016","This had to be the worst service center that I have ever visited! I took my Malibu over to get a keyless remote door opener made. I scheduled an appointment for a Friday morning at 10a. There were also a few recalls that needed to be taken care of. When I arrived the service center attendant told me that they could not make the remote, unless I had the title. That would have been fine if only he would have told me that when I made the appointment. I told him that I would have to go get the title but to go ahead and take of the recalls so that when I came back, I would only have to wait on the remote. I had no one to take me back on Friday evening only to get a ride Saturday afternoon and nothing had been done at all. Not even the recalls. It was about 1pm and they close at 5pm on Saturdays. I gave them the title and fussed a bit about the recalls not being done. The service center attendant that was there, at this time told me to come back at 3pm and he would have it taken care of. I went back at 4pm and they still hadn't even touched my car. It was still parked in the same place. This was a terrible experience and a HUGE waste of my time. They had my car for about 30 hours without even touching it!!",1.0
