3,"June 05, 2018",When I sent in they knew my credit rating sucked. Tried qualify me for 2018 but instead having to get a 2012 fiat. Before I drove off told Ramsey make sure oil was changed everything was done. Within 2 weeks oil light came on. 5 weeks a.c. went out and they wouldn't fix no cost even though I haven't made my 2nd payment. Mgr was extremely rude on phone. Steve never returned my call and now I'm having check engine light come on and off. I was also told my first oil change would.be free. My car isn't the problem it's the service dept that is. And when your woman buying vehicle by yourself dont. I put 3;500 was also told I can upgrade in 6 months..,3.4
4,"April 30, 2018","Before I go into detail about my nightmare... I need to say that I absolutely LOVED working with Mustafa and Corey from the preowned car lot of Mission Mitsubishi. They definitely helped me and my spouse out with this whole thing. 

My spouse and I were qualified for an auto loan through Capital One but they only allowed up to go to certain dealerships with somewhat of a limit on what we could purchase. Since I just moved to Texas I definitely needed a reliable/safe car to get around... we found a 2012 VW beetle that I instantly fell in love with. We decided that was the car I wanted. Once we got to Mission Mitsubishi we were approached by a very kind and charismatic salesman. We met him over at the used side to test drive and little did we know... this is where the nightmare would start. 

We sat down in a little cubicle to crunch numbers and after almost an hour of waiting we had a paper in front of us with a list about things that were wrong with the car... or so we thought. We told them that we wanted to see the history of the car and next thing you know another salesman comes into with our original to shake our hands. We told them we wouldn’t shake their hand yet because we aren’t going to buy a car that is messed up. There was a small misunderstanding about the list... at the top of it the title was cut off. Apparently it was a list of common issues with used cars that (according to the second salesman) could NOT be sold so it wasn’t anything wrong with the car. We saw the history — it was spotless. That put our minds at ease. Back to the numbers we go! My spouse was feeling ill at this time (low blood sugar) and thankfully they had a vending machine with soda. We were sent to wait for finance for another hour. 

Finally the car was purchased and they were going to clean it up and fill up the tank for us. This took 2 almost 3 freaking hours. We didn’t know why. We were getting annoyed and while we waited we had the salesman try to sell us another car for my spouses Jeep. She liked the outlander so we figured you know what... why not? It’s a new car it can’t be bad and the credit score bump of “paying off” the Jeep would be nice.  While we were test driving the outlander we each had 5 hits against our credit scores. All from different places. Only ONE was Capital One. Which is where we said we are getting the loan through. We got back and we told them that we would like to talk numbers BEFORE any credit scores were checked again because the 4 extra hits weren’t appreciated. We couldn’t get the outlander. No big deal. We were basically pushed into a Mirage (which was fine my spouse drives a lot to work and back) and when we got back we said the same thing. No credit pulls. Just throwing out numbers as much as we could. By the time the salesman came back we had 12 credit pull notifications. TWELVE. Let that sink in... trading in for the 30 point bump was basically just covering the pulls. My spouses blood sugar started to drop again... we told them we needed the keys to BOTH vehicles to go because it was getting bad. 30 minutes later, “I did some more crunching!” And NO KEYS. Finally we stood up and went to walk and get our keys. She could have fainted in the dealership after we told them multiple times that we needed to go NOW.

When we got home we were trying to show our family the car and whenever my brother in law went to start it up... it didn’t start after a 30 minute drive. So we went to open the hood and the hood latch was broken. We called the dealership right away. We get our call returned the next morning, “We meant to tell you that it needed to be sent to VW to replace the latch! Bring it in sometime!” My thought? Okay... so you sent us home in a car where we had ZERO access to the brain and you magically forgot? Is this why you kept us there for 7 hours? To make sure the car started when we went to drive off the lot? 

The next morning the car started so we thought maybe that was a hiccup. Wishful thinking on our part. We parked after a 15 minute drive - DIDNT START AGAIN. We were stuck in the hot sun for an hour waiting for the car to start again so we could take it back. While we were waiting for it to start we noticed that there were screws in the cup holder... which made us look around. The splash guard under the Beetle was TAKEN OFF. We were done at this point. Know why? Because that’s how you FIX the hood latch. They broke it after we purchased the car and they decided to not tell us. 

We get to the dealership and the Beetle was taken away to VW. One week passed. We got our plates! No car. Before we hit 14 days... the Beetle was ready. We asked if it was fixed... actually fixed this time. “Absolutely! No problems. I promise.” Guess what happened the next day? It wouldn’t start. We took it back and this time we demanded to speak to managers. We wanted this fixed... NOW. At first the sales manager (Steven) came to talk to us and asked if we thought about a new car. My wife and I both LAUGHED asking how can we afford another new car when we just got a loan out for $13,000. He walked away. This is when we met Mustafa. He was AMAZING. He put us in a newer loaner that he covered himself. 4 days later our car was ready. It worked! Everything was fixed and it didn’t come out of our pocket. After 3 days of the car starting and running flawlessly we were very pleased... that is until the car died as I was trying to get onto I-35 and the truck behind me almost hit me. Mustafa and Corey met us that night to get us in a loaner. Mustafa told us to come back on Monday and we would get everything fixed (meaning me in a different car.) 

We brought breakfast for Mustafa and ourselves Monday morning... we were getting everything situated. I fell in love with a 2017 Lancer... paperwork started going through. I was so excited that this whole thing was going to be far behind us. Several of the salesmen on the used/preowned side of Mission said that they told our previous salesman to NOT... I repeat.. NOT sell us the Beetle when he came in to get the keys for the test drive. What the actual xxxx? We spent the morning laughing and having a blast with Corey... eventually we found out that we couldn’t get the Lancer because we were using the Beetle as a trade in and it HAD to be on a new car. No big deal... Corey let us look at Mirages. I was really bummed because the color choice was poor at the time. Red, silver, or blue... eventually Corey asked my favorite color. Next thing you know we are test driving a Plum/wine red (depending on the lighting) Mirage and I was in love. We told Corey that we wanted it and we left that evening in the car. 

When we got home we were getting the paperwork ready to be put up and we noticed there was a paper saying we had etched windows... we didn’t see that anywhere on the car yet we paid $500 for it. My wife called Corey that morning and he told us to bring it in whenever we wanted to have it done. We agreed to go in once the plates came in... however that dragged out forever and we finally caved this Wednesday to have it done. We walked in and had Corey paged, talked with a few familiar faces, and went to the service waiting area. Painless. 15-20 minutes after Corey brings us the keys and the tank was topped off. On our way we go! We stopped for food and I noticed how high up the etching was... concerned I looked at all the windows. Crooked, high up, and some of the numbers weren’t complete. That night I took pictures and contacted my insurance company. They told me that the etching was in fact too high. USAA told me this. It wasn’t a small insurance company. Today (Saturday the 28th) we went to pick up our plates and asked to speak to a manager. A service advisor put our plates on and we asked him where the location of the etching should be. He told us the lower corner. My wife uncovered the etching and he even said, “That could have been a lot lower and not crooked.” He continued to say that he has heard several complaints and concerns just like ours. 

We had yet another manager come out and speak to us because at this point we were wanting something done about it. We explained to him. He said it looked fine and that it was a personal preference... when I mentioned the insurance company he told us that there isn’t a reason why they should have said that so again is fine. I’m currently reaching out to USAA again because of this and the fact I feel like this manager was lying to us since he said he has NEVER had a complaint about etchings. Too bad a service advisor said otherwise. We asked to speak to someone else. That’s when we met Zach. We told him the WHOLE story like I’ve mentioned in this review and he offered us 3 years of free maintenance and if we weren’t pleased (I expressed my trust issues with this place after being lied to repeatedly and their service department screwing up the Beetle even more) he would personally pay out of pocket to give us the $500 back. We got it in writing and it’s currently stapled to the paper we got with the etching cost in my car. 

Overall? I will never go back to the dealership unless if I know that I can directly work with and ONLY with Mustafa or Corey. I will not recommend this dealership or service department to anyone regardless of the free maintenance on my Mirage. The only things I can truly say is that I’m SO glad this whole thing is behind us and that I hope like xxxx the service I get when I go in for maintenance doesn’t match other reviews on Yelp! when everyone talks about how rude the people were towards them.

6,"January 26, 2018","So I just bought my 2015 Honda Accord from this dealership! Loved my sales guy James he was awesome ! But absolutely hated his manager ! Steve and the finance guy ! They are so pushy! And change there prices on you after 1 day !  And then they will text you every day with stupid quotes that they get from the internet to try and make you feel like they know you but they don’t since you only meet them for like 30 mins! If you don’t have to go here, don’t ! The only reason I went here was because the price of the car was a good deal but the whole experience sucked !! ",1.0
7,"December 15, 2017",The salesman was informed ahead of time of my credit score and the amount I had to put down. Originally was told I was approved but after picking up my car realized I was missing a key. Went back to get the key and was tricked into giving them the one key I had and told I was no longer approved. Next day they said they approved me under my sister and to pick up the car. 2 weeks later I received two different stories about not being approved again but Tyson promised he'd keep me in the car i just had to come in the owner promised we will work it out I mean I'd had the car almost a month now! Well the car got impounded and I called to tell them I'd bring it in after I picked it up. He said don't worry he could pick it up and it would be no problem. He even promised if he couldn't keep me in the car he'd return my down payment! Well when I returned to the dealership both Tyson and the owner are no where to be found but they sent me to the sales manager Louis and things got worse from there.  Louis made sure I knew he didn't like me or care to even try to help me and refused to give me my items from the car saying he would never have helped me any way but he couldn't control Tyson or the owner. After some rude nonchalant remarks from Louis I decided to take my leave and informed Louis that this was customer mistreatment and that I would post a review in all major sights if it wasn't corrected. This in turn made Louis say he would press criminal trespassing on me and I was never allowed there again (not that I wanted to be there but who throws a tantrum because of a bad review) whelp 2 days later Tyson finally appeared and so did my personal items but not only did he refuse to work out things with the car but kept my down payment and said since I said I would make a review he didn't care and refused to do anything. I also spoke with the tow lot who informed me the price to remove the care was 215 yet the dealership claims it was 498. All I know is i gave them all I had trusting the contracts we were signing and the words given to me. NEVER AGAIN. 500 down payment 200 insurance 50 on car accessories not to mention the full tank of gas I had just gotten,1.6

17,"March 27, 2017","I usually hate dealing with big dealership sales people, but when i got here it was instant customer service. I dealt with a extremely nice gentleman named Ramsi,and the minute we got there he was very interested in our needs and wants before even showing us a vehicle to ensure we got what we were looking for, he asked ahead of time problems that might come up with credit or credit history and then went above and beyond doing everything he could on his end to make sure we left with the vehicle we fell in love with and we did! Not to mention the manager came in to introduce himself to make sure everything was going good and to see if we needed water or coffee or anything! All around absolutely best experience at a car dealership! Process was fast n easy and excellent customer service! My grandkids even enjoyed the playroom and being able to not have to miss their favorite shows because we were there. I definitely recommend anyone looking for a vehicle go see ramsey at mission Mitsubishi!",5.0

19,"March 05, 2017",I bought a car from this dealer and I tried to tell the sales man that I did NOT want a little car. He told me that was all I could be approved for because of my credit. I knew my credit wasn't too hot because I was rebuilding it. He assured me that as long as I kept the car for 6 'moths and paid the payments on time that he could get me into the car I wanted. Which I knew didn't sound right because I would be upside down in the car at that time. But he gave me his word and promised me he would be able to get me out of the car. Well here I am 6 months later all payments have been ontime and I also always pay more than the actual payment needless to say I'm now stuck in this lil sardine can for a long time!!,1.0

I asked if they used ALLY, they said yes.  I told them to hit my credit once with Ally.  They hit it twice with another company also, causing my credit rating to go down.

25,"September 25, 2016","I have been buying new cars for almost fifty years. I went there to purchase another new car. These people use every high-pressure sales technique that I have ever seen. They take your keys to your trade in and won't give them back to you so that you can't leave. They ""double team"" you by bringing in the ""manager"" so that both he and the salesperson can pressure you. to buy the car. In the middle of the paper signing process they surprise you with a new charge that they never mentioned to you earlier. They promise you things like ""one year free service,"" but it is nowhere in the final contract so that is is your word against theirs. It's a typical fast-talking, sleazy car dealership. I feel that I was railroaded into buying a car because they just outlasted me. Don't go there alone unless you can be as pushy and obnoxious as they are.",1.2

30,"January 14, 2016","We bought the lancer right after thanksgiving, I fell in love with the car. The salesman was awesome at the time of the sale, and Dina was the best delivery person ever. The trouble started when we picked the car up. When we got home we noticed two small scratches above where the plate was attached. This was not there when we bought the car, and could only have been done by the service department when they attached the plate. I was heartbroken, this is my first new car and they gouged it. My husband contacted our salesman Roland Duran by email, he said they would fix it. I didn't want to take the car back, worried what else they may do. My husband never heard back from Roland. We have emailed about five times, no reply. I have two free oil changes, I'm not taking my car near them. This is the fifth Mitsubishi my husband has bought, first from this dealer. I will not recommend them, nor go back. As of today we have not received the plates for the car, and my husband says he has to go get them.

32,"November 12, 2015","My experience with this Dealership was not as good as I would have hoped. I will say that the salesmen was very nice and helpful, but only to a point. Everything seemed good while in the process of picking out a vehicle. I was already interested in the Outlander ES, but he suggested and really tried to sell me on the sport. I was really interested in the ES, but he kept assuring me that the Sport was a better fit for my family, which was the focal point on get an SUV period. I took his advise and went with the smaller SUV, he gave me all of the information I needed and answered as much of my questions as he could. He then asked me if the price was fair for me to work with and i said yes because that was roughly what I was paying for my car and that my credit report would prove that, so it all sound like it was going well. Then we went on the test drive which left me feeling like we booth we're very sure that Outlander Sport was the right choice. Once inside we started to try and fill out all the paper work. they we're willing to use there bonus cash event deal to help pay my negative equity. Then he went through all the information with my wife and myself. As we were hashing out all the details he called my old dealer to get my cars info so they could pay what remained on it and tack it on to my new payment, which was ok because there bonus cash event would take care of most of it anyway. By this point I was like ""Oh wow i found a dealer that was willing to work with me"" but was I for a bit of a surprise. After some time the sales man comes back after checking up on some stuff ,with one of his managers. The manger then begins to tells me that my personal vehicle I bought from my dealer was not being reported and that my dealership had lied to me about doing so to help my credit, little did he know i had just looked at my credit report from Transunion, just a few day's earlier and saw that they were reporting it every month since i bought the car 2 years ago. Then he proceed to tell me my credit was really bad and that i could not be financed by anyone, which was odd because he then tried to tell me that they could work something out by getting me into a Mirage. At this point my wife got upset because she could tell they just wanted to make a sale instead of trying to work to sell us what we wanted. By this point I told him thank you for your time but I'm not interested because I need a bigger car than the Mirage for my family (which is also smaller than my car), he then began to tell me that he had a friend that worked for the credit bureau and could help to get my payments of the Mirage be even lower. This was an obvious attempt to hook me on a car i had no need or want for. The funny part is they put all the hard work to get me into the Mirage, why couldn't they work as hard to get me into the Outlander. My income could pay for my monthly payments easily.  I mean xxxx  I would of been fine with the payments and been content with being in debt to them for the car my family wanted and needed. 

That was my experience and I will be very hesitant to go back.I hope Mitsubishi looks into how many sales and costumers they are losing out on at this location in San Antonio.

36,"September 02, 2015","I purchased my 2015 Lancer GT from here and seemed to have a good experience on purchase day, that's where everything went wrong. I came back to for my first oil change and asked about paint chips across the hood of my car and what can be done about them because I had way too many to count (13 above the drivers headlight alone). They advised me it was from rocks and that they sent images to Mitsubishi and they weren't going to cover it under warranty. I leave and find a huge chunk of paint missing from a side skirt which was not there when I dropped off the car and called and they agreed to fix it (service dept is great with every aspect I've had to deal with them on) While there I spoke with a manager about the paint chips again and was under the assumption that they would fix that along with the large chunk of paint as it appears to be a bad paint job (rare but my luck would put me with that problem). I picked it up and paint chips are still across the hood, spoke with a different manager who couldn't help because he was not the manager I spoke with previously. I have not gone back since and have more paint chips, including ones down the side of my car now (obviously not from rocks on the highway) I plan on going for that when I get time (it's a 45 minute drive) as well as other issues. I have had such a horrible experience not just with the dealership but with Mitsubishi in general that I do not plan on buying another car from this manufacturer again. ",1.6

46,"April 10, 2014","The Story:
First off, we had Tony P. as our salesman. He was great! Very friendly and honest. Now for the ""financing"" portion of the experience. Go to their website, check out their prices which are correct. No where on the site does it say there is a $3000+ fee for in house financing and a 24.99% interest rate. They also said the interest rate could range between 16% and 24%. Then was told, there's no budging on that, it's 24%. I understand that they take the risk in financing but when you call to ask about their in house, they don't tell you exact details until they have roped you into the dealer.  I called ahead of time, inquiring about the in house financing option. Of course they leave out important details, make you waste your time viewing the vehicle, driving it, driving to another lot and then drop the fine print on you when it was asked up front!

The finance rep Ceasar (should have been Napoleon) definitely not a people person. He has the it's a take it or leave it attitude. It's not what you say, its how you say it buddy! Joe the Manager was the same exact way.

Just from that aspect of deception, I would not deal with Mission Mitsubishi going through conventional financing or not, Wouldn't even deal with them if they came back now and said they would honor the internet pricing they have posted.

DriveTime is looking better and better by the minute! Now that's saying something!

The Outcome:
After this review was submitted, I received an email from Louis G. (Internet Manager)""I have read this email and I will make this right. will you please call me when you can so we can talk."" After speaking with Louis and expressing my view and feelings of how Ceasar treated me and my wife, the issue of this unexceptional individual was taken care of. Louis also asked me to bring my vehicle in for service, 27pt check, free of charge in exchange for taking this review down. The service was done on my vehicle but then I had more of a chance to speak with him one on one in his office. First, the vehicle we looked at was not available for in house financing, when we were told by our salesman and Ceasar that it was. The $3000+ ""fee"" could also not be taken off making this $13995 car $16995 and a 24.99% interest. Making the cost of this car almost DOUBLE of what the internet pricing is and what it's worth in reality over a 4 year period.

We gave this dealer the chance to ""make this right"" and honor their internet pricing and deception of the $3000+ ""fee"" tacked onto the in house financing option even though I said earlier that I wouldn't even do business with them regardless. After checking again with a different sales rep, I was told there are no additional fees, all you need are references, $1000 down for any of their hand chosen in house financing cars. This rep would not give any % on interest.

Now, I am greatful for the free service that was performed but nothing was made right. What would make this right? Honor your internet pricing without the hidden $3000+ fee. Oh, did I forget to mention that my down payment was going to be $3000? Kinda ironic how that ""fee"" is the same amount of my down payment.

Upon thinking about the whole situation, I didn't think it would do anyone (consumer) any justice to have this review taken down. I thought it would be better to keep the original content and then update it with the outcome I have added.

I hope this helps someone to avoid this dealer. I'm sure there are a lot of dealers out there like this, just so happens that this one got caught red handed.",2.5

    Everyone was friendly, and so far the vehicle is running splendidly.  I was a little taken aback by the push for extended warranty/service package, as the car sale had been no pressure at all; I finally took it after negotiating the price downward.  One disappointment was that there was no followup fone call, letter, or Email from the dealership to thank me and/or enquire as to my state on contentment.

94,"March 18, 2011","Staff was friendly and courteous.  Did not pressure us at all.  Accepted USAA Auto Circle voucher with zero issues.  Even fixed minor issues on used vehicle, that was already well under KBB, for no extra charge!  They really go the extra mile to provide great service at Mission Mitsubishi.  I highly recommend them to anyone if you want a relaxing atmosphere to buy a vehicle.",4.6
95,"March 17, 2011",We went to Mission to compare prices and to look at a used vehicle. I did tell our salesman that for the right price I would consider new. He ended up making a deal that we could not walk away from and we ended up getting 2 new vehicles! The only problem that we ran into was the main Mitsubishi office did not understand the deal and kept calling us for payment when it was the dealership who was to make the payment. However; the dealership worked extremely hard to fix the problem and they got to the bottom of it! We are VERY happy with the way it turned out.,4.8
96,"March 17, 2011",I took my car in for repair to the door locks. During the repair the repair tech in stalling lock damaged the door. Greg had it repaired with no problems. This a good place to have you car serviced with major repairs. Also not if but when my car breaks down I will take it back to mission mitsu. The knowledgeable staff here just wont quit till they get it right.,4.8
97,"March 05, 2011","I was looking through the newspaper and I saw an advertisement from Mission Mitsubishi saying they are having good deals on repossessed vehicles. I saw they had a good deal on an Infiniti G35 so I called the dealership and spoke to a gentlemen by the name of Monty. I asked him if the car was still there and he told me that it was. We scheduled a meeting that day to see the car.   I saw the car. Fell in love with it. Monty and Zack, the sales manager, helped me with acquiring this car at a great price. They were very friendly and they really cared about what I needed about this car. They even gave me 100k warranty on the car. This dealer and sales personnel don’t try to scam you. They really are concerned for your needs and wants. I recommend Mission Mitsubishi to those who are in the market for a new or used vehicle.",5.0
