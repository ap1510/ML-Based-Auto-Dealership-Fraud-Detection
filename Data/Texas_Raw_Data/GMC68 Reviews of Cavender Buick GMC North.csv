0,"October 10, 2019","I bought a new 2007 Avalanche from Cavender Chevy, and all major service was performed by Cavender GMC North for last 10 years. This summer, the computer aboard began sending false signals resulting in loss of engine power and traction control while driving. Online blogs show this problem is not uncommon and I furnished them to Cavender when I asked for repairs to be made. Cavender made other (unneeded) repairs for $467 and next day, same problem. Now Cavender won't return my calls, won't refund me. Repeated calls were made including to William Donohue, Joe Stallings, Todd Cavender. None returned. I haven't reached out to Bobby Cavender yet -hoping I don't have to.  Maybe Cavender can fix the easy stuff, but they can't tackle the tough stuff.  Avoid service dept.",2.0
1,"February 13, 2019","True definition of unprofessionalism and lack of customer service is how I would describe my experience at Cavender GMC/Buick. I was incredibly disappointed with their service. I inquired about a used car and originally worked with Adam Ochoa and Roger Rivera (sales manager?). After a few days of planning, I was able to make a trip from Austin to San Antonio on 02/18/19 to test drive the car I wanted. I was looking to make a decision fairly quickly. Upon arrival, Daniel Ramirez was assigned to us. Adam came by to introduce himself, and both salesmen made sure to emphasize they took turns being the “Salesman of the Month”. After being presented with hypothetical numbers, I decided to move forward with my credit application.  I requested to be run with my credit union first (preferred lender). While I waited, Daniel spent his time offering a $960 “insurance” for tires, paint, and leather conditioning. Despite asking about the price and terms of the bumper-to-bumper warranty Cavender offered, I did not receive an answer better than “It covers anything the light touches”, but no price or terms. I was declined for financing with the Credit Union, which I was prepared for (I am rebuilding credit). I spoke to Ron (finance) and agreed to run my credit with two more lenders. After an hour wait, Daniel came back to the sales floor to inform me I was approved with one of the lenders, with a higher down-payment. I requested the full terms and conditions of the loan to discuss them with my husband, and his response was “I don’t have them” (first attempt). Daniel said he would find out, and call me. At this point, I had spent SEVERAL hours at Cavender and decided to drive back to Austin. I did not hear back from Daniel that day. My husband and I decided we could offer a 50% down-payment if we could get a low note, OR purchase the vehicle cash if it was the best option for our family. I reached out to Daniel the next morning (02/19/2018) at 11AM to request the terms (second attempt). He responded finance had the paperwork, but I would get a response as soon as possible. I called again at 2:30PM and was told they were swamped and he needed to call me back. At 5:45PM I reached out to him, yet again, and he responded “Still Swamped” (third attempt). I decided to reach out to Roger in hopes of obtaining the terms of the loan and I was told he would “look in to it” (fourth, and last attempt). By the end of the day, I still did not have the terms of the loan I got approved for. After wasting our time with this dealership, we decided to apply for a loan through the same Credit Union directly, and went to CARMAX in Austin (famous for no haggle pricing). We drove our new car home yesterday! In the end, we walked out with a much better deal. We paid a relatively comparable amount for a newer car, with less miles, luxury package.. and the price included bumper-to-bumper warranty! The car I wanted had been at Cavender for over 180 days when I went to see it, and last I checked, it’s still sitting in their lot. Save yourself the headache, this dealer is not doing YOU a favor. Spend your money wisely, and go elsewhere. You won’t regret it! ",1.2
2,"March 22, 2018","I bought a certified Denali  two days ago and was treated with the upmost respect.  Cody the car salesman did an excellent job of explaining and demonstrating all things to me    The finance people and another guy but I don’t know his title were so nice and friendly to work with    I would go back there and buy vehicle anytime.  I highly recommend all people that love GMC‘s visit Cavender‘s North San Antonio   They also had in inventory out of this world five floors of cars    Thank you for all your help and for the beautiful vehicle that I ended up getting. 
 This is definitely a five-star car dealership. ",5.0

4,"November 25, 2017",Lee was a pleasure to work with once again. We are returning customers and would not consider using another sales person. His dedication to excellent customer service shows in every encounter and his willingness to deliver the vehicle we desire continually goes above and beyond our expectations. ,5.0
5,"August 23, 2017",Just want to say that don't ever buy a used vehicle from them without the extended warranty.  I bought a used car like 2 and a half months ago and thank God I added the extended warranty.  The vehicle is at a shop right now after been taken there several times because the steering column was making a weird noise. What they said it was there is not wrong with it we couldn't find anything. I ain't no mechanic but when your steering wheel vibrates when you hit a pothole it got to be something wrong. Well I took it to 2 different mechanics which one of them is the guys from the extended warranty and they said the column was bad plus 2 more things that add up to 5k . I just want to say stay away from them and I will never go to that dealership again.  Thanks for selling a car who they supposedly did a inspection and who I paid 12k for it then not even 1500 miles down the road it has to be get fixed for 5k more and cavender just said thanks for your service. ,1.8

7,"February 26, 2017",My sales man Randy Villareal along with the whole team were just amazing. I cannot explain how fast and smooth of a process it was. I will most def be returning to them when I need them. They do as much as possible to help I must add that our credit is not as great and we were still able to get a great deal with no hassles. ,5.0
8,"February 12, 2017",My experience with Cavender Buick was simply amazing.  From the minute I arrived everything went smoothly.  My salesman was Stuart Lagerson and he was very helpful throughout the whole process. I am a very happy customer and will return to Cavender in the future. ,5.0
9,"January 27, 2017","Bob Dowland is the Service Manger I use he is exceptional.  He can assist me with any question about my vehicle over the phone.  If my car needs to be brought in to be fixed we set a date and a time.  On that day and time my car is fixed in a timely manner as well as well as being fixed right the first time.i have  confidence that when I bring my car into Bob it will be fixed right and also be road worth, which makes me feel safe.  I feel secure with any answers, suggestions he says I need to do to my car.  Bob Dowsland is an asset to Cavender not every Service Manager is honest, trustworthy, available to customer all the time., and cares for his customers.  Bob Dowsland has my bussiness",4.6

14,"July 27, 2015","Absolutely the worst customer service I have ever experienced!!!!! I had my brand new denali broken into, this was the first dealership that came to mind to have repairs. I was told it would take 2-3 weeks for me to have my vehicle back. It was towed to their dealership on June 24th, it is now July 27th and they still have my vehicle. I have not received any calls or emails on my vehicles status. I would not recommend ANY Cavender locations to anyone. I have complained and I guess nobody cares to give me a call back. I will be letting everyone I know about my experience with Cavender!!!!",1.0
15,"June 04, 2014","I experienced an issue with their service department. When brought to his attention, President Bobbie Cavender stepped up to the plate and personally took care of me. He personally picked up my Acadia at my home and personally returned it the next day. He provided not yet due warranty service at no charge. In my opinion, he went above and beyond to make it right for me. This dealership is part of the Cavender family of dealerships. They have a much deserved fantastic reputation. Bobbie certainly maintained it in my case.",5.0
16,"April 02, 2014","I was not an easy client and Ian Bertini was the most unbelievably kind and understanding salesman I've encountered.  He answered every question I had in detail and he never said he didn't know the answer even if he didn't.  He was quick to find the answer and produce results.  I left the dealership without purchasing a vehicle and what I didn't know is that while I was taking a break and trying to figure out my next step in the car buying process, he was steadily working on finding the perfect vehicle for me within my financial means.  He called me up, asked me to come in one more time and see what he was able to find andI ended up in a brand new Buick Encore (I have never purchased a new car before) and absolutely love it.  I know there were a lot of other financial people behind the scenes working to make the sale happen for me as well and I'd like to extend my appreciation to them as well.  The in house sales experience was the best I've had in 20 years.  However.  I will say that the only thing that left me feeling incomplete was the ""survey"".  I was told before driving off the lot that in about a month I would recieve a survey and it would give me the opportunity to give my feedback regarding the sales experience and I never recieved it.  I called and spoke with a sales manager who told me that not everyone gets them and there is nothing more that can be done.  I find it unfair that some customers get to rate their sales experience and others don't.  What factors determine who gets the survey?  What did I do not to deserve the survey, or what did my sales manager, Ian do to deserve less recognition for all of his hard work than others?  This left me feeling like the sale was incomplete and made me feel dissappointed in the closure of a sale.  I hope they tweek this process in the future because I can't be the only one that feels something is unfair about this process.  ",5.0
17,"December 27, 2013","Had to take my car back 3 times and it still was only barely acceptable, not fixed as prior to servicing. Starting to have even more issues several months after which are appearing due to terrible servicing / body shop repairs. Very disappointing. I thought Cavender would be a better company since family owned. Next time going back to Alamo Toyota for the excellent service and any body shop repairs needed. They fixed my vehicle back to exactly like prior to car accident.

I would never recommend Cavender, especially this location/dealer.",1.8
18,"October 17, 2013","I had a wonderful experience with this gmc dealer. I went to them looking for a estimate on a rear brake job for my gmc 3500 dually, Curtis Kirk greeted me and my issue with amazement. When i arrived just to get a estimate, i told him i been to a few other shops prior to seeing him that day and in fact that i know i didn't need rear rotors but i did need them turned. He then looked up the estimate but the estimate came up wrong, so he made some phone calls and next thing i know...............i had the shop foreman/manager, parts manager and the truck master tech, standing next to me working on the right estimate. We got the estimate down to i knew what i was paying out the door. The next day i decided to actually use curtis for my problem, i took my truck up to him and dropped it off. He got me a ride home and stayed in contact with me through out the whole repair, we found that i needed hub seals and my parking brake repaired(since its rear disk brake)......................they gladly offered to show me the worn seals and worn parking brake shoes. I went to see since i don't trust many mechanics with my vehicles, upon arrival the service manager greeted me since my service advisor was off(it was the weekend), he took me and showed me the worn out parts and also got the master tech that was working on my truck to explain what was wrong. I signed up for the repairs after a quick price adjustment to add the extra parts. I told the service manager i cant pick up til friday and he was completely cool with it. So they completed the repairs and i picked up the truck friday, i came to find out the estimate to add the parking brake repair and hub seal repair was off but the service manger and my advisor stuck by the original price the quoted. I was very pleased with the repair and their honesty, i will be taking my truck back to curtis and the cavender gmc.",5.0
19,"April 16, 2013","Lee Cox was incredibly helpful.  He took the time to understand our financial situation, refused to let us work on a transaction until he was satisfied that the vehicle we were looking at met his own personal expectations, and was very up-front and honest throughout the whole process.  His knowledge of the industry, the manufacturer, and the market were apparent in his communication with us.  He responds to telephone calls, calls back when messages are left, makes himself available, and takes the time to be very personable and friendly with his customers.  

Cavender Buick GMC was a well-run, clean dealership, and we had no problems with any staff members there.  We were acknowledged immediately upon arrival, directed to our salesman, and all of our questions were answered.  When we walked in with financing pre-approval, the dealer was able to beat the rates we walked in with.  

Positive experience!  ",4.4
20,"January 10, 2013"," I purchased a used 2007 GMC Yukon a year ago due to needing a larger vehicle.  I had a 2007 GMC Envoy that I traded. The Yukon I purchased had high mileage but I was confident that Cavender/GMC sells reliable vehicles and can service the vehicle if there were any issues.  

I am one who takes in my vehicles for regular maintenance like clockwork.  I noticed I my low oil light came on about 200 miles before the suggested 3,000 miles oil change.  I took my Yukon in right away to be looked at and explained the low oil light and my concern.  I have a habit of asking my service rep to be sure to let me know if the mechanic finds anything that he thinks needs to be addressed to take care of it.  I am a big believer in taking care of issues before they are issues.  And clearly I had confidence in Cavender GMC that they would address any issues head on especially when I clearly was a repeat customer and never questioned what they suggested I have done to my vehicle.  The low oil light continued to come on anywhere from 400 to 200 miles before my required scheduled oil change suggested on the sticker on my windshield put there by the Cavender Service Person, in which I believed I could trust to ensure my vehicle would get the attention it needed to continue to run smoothly.  Because that’s what they do for a living, right?    Wrong!  I reported this problem and did whatever service they suggested to fix this issue.  Starting in January 2012 until December of 2012.  I even called to discuss my concern thinking bringing my vehicle in on a Saturday was too hectic and if I had a complete conversation explaining my concern more attention would be given to the problem.  I called and spoke with David Lust and thought I had expressed my concerns to his understanding but all David could say was all of this is within GMC guide lines.  WHAT!  GMC, GMC!  General Motor Corporation says its within their guide lines to have to add oil after only being driven 2,500 miles?  If that is really the case I was ready to write a letter to GMC and advise them to shut down their factory because those guide lines were ridiculous!  I ended my conversation with David and decided I had to take my vehicle in and talk face to face with someone.  And that even I knew those expectation were not believable. 

I called and spoke with Marshall Lane and explained my concerns.  He looked at my vehicle and said yes this is a problem that should be addressed by our GMC expert.  Marshall asked me when could I bring my vehicle in during the week?  We tried several different appointments but due to my job and not having transportation other than the weekends we could never make it work.  Out of frustration I called Marshall and said look I can't come in during the week, Marshall said, don't worry Ms. Browning, bring your vehicle in and I'll get you something to drive, it may be a truck but I will get you something.  Finally some help, I thought.  I showed up that next morning and Marshall came through for me.  My loner vehicle was the biggest truck I had ever driven.  Marshall asked me, will you be ok in this, I smiled and said of course.  I drove off feeling like someone finally was listening.

Marshall called me that afternoon and said they thought it was the engine and that the pistons’ and rings needed to be replaced but not to worry, he was going to put it through my extended warranty and it would be taken care of.  I thanked him.  It went back and forth between Cavender and the extended warranty company adding that there was even a memo from GMC regarding this issue.  Which I called Marshall to so that I could stay in the loop as to what happening.  Marshall assured me this issue would be taken care of.  Finally about 3 three weeks later Marshall informed me that the warranty company had denied the claim since the records had shown that this issue had been addressed several times over the past 11 months.  And that the drive train warranty had just expired this past August.  In other words the warranty company was not going to pick up the tab for something that could and should have been addressed prior to the drive train warranty expiring.  In which case the denied my claim.  Marshall advised me that this issue was being reviewed by the service manager as to what their next step was and he would get back to me.  Marshall got back to me the next day letting me know that the repair costs were going to be taken care of by the Good Will GMC Policy.  The What!  Whatever just fix my vehicle.  What you call &quot;Good Will GMC Policy is you got caught not taking care of a problem back when it started and the Warranty Company called you out on it, and wouldn't pick up the tab for you team just being lazy and lucky for me because I'm sure if they hadn't of been involved I'm sure the staff would have told me I would have to foot the bill. But since there was a third party involved Cavender GMC had to fess up to their lack of service.  

I will say I am grateful to Marshall Lane for doing his job and getting off of his butt and taking care of this for me.  He was very kind in the fact that I needed additional help with transportation. Unlike all the other service reps didn't feel the need to do their job for almost a year.  Good Will my rear end!  Now my Yukon should be ready today and now since I clearly cannot trust Cavender GMC to address and handle issues with my vehicles I will be at Jordan Ford this weekend to get something with low mileage and hopeful their service team will take customers concerns more seriously.  It’s too bad I really did enjoy the ride of my Yukon but it really doesn't matter because if it isn't taken care of its not riding anywhere anyway.  

I can only hope this review makes it to your review website but if it doesn't I wouldn't be surprised.

24,"June 11, 2012","I am a widow and was  looking for a car and needing trustworthy, reliable assistance.  After visiting numerous dealerships I discovered my experience to be a smooth one at Cavender.  My sincere thanks go out to Justin Taylor for finding my dream car.  David Hagen for meeting my budget and roy Fernandez from the body shop for fixing a dent and making a 10 year old car look like new.  I highly recommend Canender !",5.0
25,"May 30, 2012",We had 2 vehicles that needed body work.  Roy Fernandez was able to give us an estimate on both vehicles and have both repaired in the same week to accommodate our work schedules. Would recommend Roy and Cavender Buick Repair Shop to anyone.,5.0
26,"May 13, 2012","Chose to visit dealership based on Internet ad for a car we were interested in. Randy Villarreal was very helpful and friendly. We attempted to negotiate the deal and David Hagen became involved. He was extraordinarily rude and inappropriate. Example:  I suggest a price. He says, ""That will never happen in a million years."".   He says he underpriced the vehicle on the internet and, ""just watch...I'm going to raise it $1000 now.  You'll see if you look at it online again.""  My wife expressed a concern about a sound she heard from the brakes and asks to have them checked. Mr. Hagen says they've already been checked. My wife says she heard noise when test driving. Mr. Hagen says, ""You don't have to keep repeating that, I said yes ma'am."". I was ready to walk, but ultimately this is a business deal and we completed the transaction.  The reason we questioned the brakes having been checked is that there were 3 other defects that we noticed (should have been obvious) but the dealer hadnt caught them during their inspection  Mr. Villarreal was trying to be a buffer and we did appreciate his help. We would not recommend the dealership based on our interaction with Mr. Hagen, however other employees were friendly.  ",3.0

34,"December 06, 2011","I have a 2011 Buick Lacrosse CXS. I have tried diligently to not get any dings on this car.  However, I did it myself.  Backed out of garage and broke the plastic casing on driver rear mirror.  Since it was time for the second oil change, had the dealership order the part and scheduled maintenance.  Marshall was very helpful and the parts people knew just what was needed without even seeing the car.  Brought the car in at 7AM and it was immediately taken in for repair and oil change.  Little over an hour later it was finished.  Dan Houghton (Service Manager?) made sure everything was just right.  I have to say to anyone who uses this site as a means to determine if they're working with a dealership that stands with you before, during and after the sale, then this dealership is one you can trust.  I'm a retired Army Officer and I have a reputation to say what I mean and always ""mean what I say.""  This Lacrosse has been everything I expected.  The dealership, from my salesman David Knight, to the great service department, and the personal oversight of Bobby Cavander has earned my trust and most certainly will earn my business.

40,"September 21, 2011","My husband and I recently purchased a 2011 GMC Acadia from Cavender. This dealership provides such a high level of customer service in both service and sales, we will not buy a vehicle from anywhere else. Our salesman was Ken Sanquist. He was very helpful and professional through the entire buying process. He listened to what we wanted and showed us exactly what we asked for. There was no pressure, only honest advice and a friendly personality. Ken also spent a lot of time covering the features of the vehicle and ensured our complete satisfaction before driving off the lot.

We were so impressed with this dealership and Ken that we came back and bought a 2011 Sierra 1500. Without hesitation, we recommend this dealership and Ken Sanquist to all of our friends and family. We could not be more pleased with both of our car buying experiences. If you want total satisfaction in your car buying experience with great customer service, go to Cavender GMC and see Ken Sanquist. He is hands down the best salesman we have ever worked with before!

44,"August 24, 2011","Just bought a new Buick Enclave from Cavender, the second new vehicle (first was a 2009 GMC Yukon) we have bought from Cavender Buick GMC in the last few years.  My experiences with this dealership are uniformly outstanding, from the sales floor to the business guys to the service group and even the body shop (the first week I had the Yukon, I scraped the bumper backing out of my garage.  When I took it to the body shop and asked them to take a look, one of the supervisors came out and worked on it for nearly an hour, cleaned it up and would not accept payment.) I have great respect for the owners as businesspeople and as people.  It is the rare customer who does not meet Bobby Cavender during the buying,or even the shopping, experience. He just wants to be sure you have a positive experience with his dealership.  These guys understand customer service as well as any businesspeople I know. I don't know how many cars I have bought during my nearly 50 years driving, but I do know this is the best dealership I have encountered during that time.  You can't go wrong with Cavender Buick GMC.  They just won't let you.

Great individual that I have to give thanks to...not only for being a great ""customer service representative"" and ""salesman"" but because he served as a U.S. Marine and sacrificed above and beyond for his country.  He is great!!!  Keep up the good work!!!",4.4
46,"August 22, 2011"," I have bought cars for the past 45 years and would put Cavender at the top of the list.  As my salesman in buying my last two vehicles I couldn't ask for a more courteous, knowledgeable,and reasonable individual as David Knight. Coming to a final price was painless and favorable to both of us. He also willingly addressed questions and problems I had after taking delivery of the car.    David Lust is my service consultant and he has made my visits convenient as well as addressing all my concerns and requests.     Joe Atilano is not only very personable but allowed me to be with- out my car for only one day. Moreover, he did a great repair job.    I will continue buying cars at Cavender Buick.",5.0
47,"August 03, 2011","We love our Buick LaCross and the sevice dept. has been great inspite of all the construction they got going. David and Jack were great to work with and made us feel
good about our purchase of the LACross. Great Customer service is hard to find these
days anywhere...but we got treated with the best at Cavender Buick. This is the best 
new vehicle purchase experience we've ever had.

48,"June 22, 2011","I recently purchased a Buick LaCrosse CXS fully equipped from this dealer.  I had narrowed my choices down to the Lexus ES350 and the LaCrosse.  My criteria boiled down to value and true luxury (for me the one with the quietest ride).  In comparison of the two vehicles, there is no comparison.  The LaCrosse won hands down.  This car truly has a luxury feel about it.  Not just quiet inside, but ""weird"" quiet.  There is absolutely no wind or road noise that enters the cabin.  I'm a musician and I love my music when I'm driving.  I had a choice of a six CD player with the Lexus or a 10gig recordable hard drive in the Buick.  I now have over 60 CDs recorded and a menu to play by song, by album, by genre, etc.  And the hard drive is only a little over 10 percent full.  Just recently went in for the first oil change.  Couldn't be more pleased.  Everyone helpful, done quickly, washed and ready to go in less than 30 minutes.  I can't say enough about the sales experience.  I drove several LaCrosse models.  I was there every week for over a month.  David Knight my Salesman was very patient, answered all my questions and I never felt pressure.  I think he knew the car would sell itself which it did.  I believe I got a very fair deal on my trade and the price (which was a couple thousand less that a Lexus).  Since driving this car I have been stopped many times to be complimented on the looks of the LaCrosse.  I will definitely stay in this car line for years to come.  Looking forward to the introduction of the LaCrosse Hybrid.",5.0
49,"June 15, 2011",Sales process was excellent little over an hour total time including test drive. But that wasn't the end. 2 days after purchase noticed huge nail in one of the tires of the new truck. Manuel saw me in the service sept and after I told him what happened he went to manager and they agreed to pay half the price of the tire without me asking for it. They have earned my business.,5.0
50,"March 31, 2011","When I walked into the dealership around mid November the first person I bumped into was Felix Declet. I had purchased my 2001 Suburbsan from Covert in Bastrop in 2000 and in early November my wife and I spent about a week in Bastrop with our travel trailer and 2 Boxers for some R&R. I figured I would be buying from them again and so we visited them 2 times while we were there. We ""built"" our vehicle, discussed discounts and rebates and then decided to go home and discuss it more. 

Soon afterwards I needed to ask someone (anyone) some questions so, as I worked very near Cavender at 281 & IH37, I decided to drop by one day. I met Felix first. Felix answered my questions and clarified a few things. As I was leaving he asked me some question (I cannot remember what) and I thanked him for his time and told him we expected to buy from Covert due to pricing. Felix only stated that ""We compete quite well with Covert"" and I left. 

Some days later I decided to let Felix compete with Covert. Our salesperson that we visited with at Covert was ""ok"", but I had left with some reservations about him. His follow-up to my queries left a lot to be desired while everything with Felix was attended to immediately. When I was close to ""pulling the trigger"" I emailed the Covert guy and told him ""exactly"" what I wanted and asked for a final quote within 3-5 days. He never did respond so, in essence, he eliminated himself. 

By this time I had decided that he would have to decimate Felix anyway as I really liked the way Felix explained things, his professional demeanor, and his willingness to go the ""extra mile"". He never tired of my questions and always followed up on my needs. This was a 2011 GMC 3/4 4WD Deisel PU and this is an expensive vehicle. I did my homework and am totally (I have had the vehicle for over a month) satisfied with my experience. I had told Felix of my experience with Gunn Honda in 2006 that was horrible. It took me over 3.5 hours to get out of their building when I bought my Accord. Hell, I thought they wanted to adopt me! Felix assured me that it would not be that way with Cavender and is was not.

I am most appreciative of Felix's honesty & character and always ""doing what he told me he would do"". I felt trust from him from the time I first met him and I would recommend Felix & Cavender to anyone. Even 5 weeks later he is working with me on accessories and minor problems as he promised he would. Thank you Felix.

Regards,

Jim Cahalan

54,"March 25, 2011","I was widowed about 6 months ago and going through the process of having to purchase a vehicle was quite unsettling for me.  I'd already narrowed down my selection to a Suburban, knew my budget and was ready to buy, however, I needed the salesperson to meet certain criteria for me to feel comfortable with this significant a purchase.  I'd walked away from other dealerships and was ready to do so again, but didn't have to.

Monti Samuels met my criteria...that criteria being a person who would be a sincere advocate for the customer.  When a person possesses this quality, it shows. I'm very grateful he was among the several sales consultants from which I could choose to help me.   

I feel confident in my vehicle selection, thanks mostly to Monti.  He listened and listened, showed me many vehicles, walked me through many steps and asked me many questions which helped me select the right Suburban for the right reasons.  I also ran Monti in circles and asked him to ""jump through many hoops"" during the negotiation process, of which he did without hesitation.  He remained calm, caring and my advocate from the moment I walked into Cavender.

At the time of purchase dealerships were not important to me, the sales consultant was.  I actually purchased from Monti that day....Cavender just happened to be where he worked.

Monti is still my advocate.  He's still looking out for me, which is also looking out for Cavender.  Next time I have to purchase a vehicle I will remember not only Monti, but Cavender as well.  Cavender can be very proud and honored to have Monti on the team.


Sincerely,
Lajuana Kubany",4.8
55,"March 12, 2011",Monti Samuels provided excellent customer service. He attentively listened to my request for information about the latest 2011 GMC Yukon Denali and 2011 GMC Acadia Denali. His immeasurable knowledge allowed him to give insightful information on standards and additional features flawlessly. His honesty and sincerity was surprisingly refreshing. He methodically presented the pros and cons of each vehicle. This delightful experience allows me and my wife to thoroughly examine possible options and accurately select the precise vehicle for our potential wants and tangible needs.  ,5.0
56,"March 12, 2011",I bought a 2007 mustang gt cs from him and the service was great!

We had even gone to new braunfels to shop. when we passed by cavender and saw my car on th lot. Mr. Cox was very helpful I'm answering our questions and ensuring that we were completly satisfied with the car befor we bought it. We would defiantly buy from cavender again! ,5.0
57,"March 11, 2011","I have purchased several vehicles from Cavender over the years,and it has always beem a very positive experience. The dealership is always pleasant and I,ve received excellent service on my cars when they have needed recommened oil changes or recall work from the service department. My salesman, Lee Cox, has been extremely helpful with the purchase of my car. He explained how the vehicle worked,and all the steps involved in the buying process, answering all my questions completely, with lots of patience,and a polite and friendly attitude.  I would recommend Cavender dealership and Lee Cox to my friends and family looking to buy a new or used vehicle.",5.0
58,"March 11, 2011","This is our second time working with Cavender dealerships and we have had positive experiences both times. This time we worked with Alexis, who was very patient and kind during a time of choosing a different vehicle than what we had driven previously. She provided excellent customer service both before and after the sale. We have also been extremely satisfied with Cavender's financial department. They make buying a car a pleasant experience. We learned that Alexis had only been at the dealership just over a month when we had the pleasure of working with her. We hope she will be around for many years so that we can be repeat customers!",5.0
59,"March 11, 2011","We went in to just look at the 2011 cars and ending up buying a Buick.  Since we were there, we ""just looked"" at the 2011 GMC trucks.  And ended up buying a new truck.  Hubby has driven nothing but a Silverado for years but LOVES his new GMC Sierra.  This is our third vehicle purchase from Cavender Buick GMC and from Manuel.  Why?  Not because Manuel is a hard-pushing salesman but because Cavender goes out of their way to make us feel like family.  Everyone that works there, from the owner on down, puts their customers first.  And Manuel in particular makes it easy to buy a vehicle.  From putting up with endless questions to ordering accessories to making service appts.  No one does it better!",5.0
60,"March 10, 2011","I went looking for a luxury car.  I had looked at the Lexus and wanted to see what
the Buicks had to offer. Felix showed me the Buick Lucerne CXL, I was alittle hesitant
on the vehicle, because I really had my mind set on a Lexus. Felix did a wonderful
job of showing me all the perks of the Buick Lucerne, it had all the same accessories
that the Lexus had but at a better price. Felix was so knowledgable, and so professional.  I really enjoyed my buying experience with Cavender Buick, GMC.
Thanks to Felix Declet.  I will recommend him and Cavender Buick, GMC to all my family

61,"March 09, 2011","Purchasing a vehicle a Cavender GMC was very convenient and easy.  Felix Declet was very knowledgeable and listened to my list of wants in order to find me the perfect vehicle.  He was able to guide me toward a Terrain which has been perfect for my growing family.  Felix also took the time to show me the features of my car and how each one of them worked.  After the sale I have continued to be impressed with the many perks of my Terrain.  Each month I receive, via e-mail, a report showing how my car is performing.  When my tires needed additional air I was able to see this quickly through the report and address the problem.  I would definitely recommend this dealership and especially Felix to my friends and family.",5.0
62,"March 09, 2011","My husband and I purchased a pre-owned 2000 Buick LeSabre 9 years ago at
Cavender Buick on 1604/UTSA Blvd and have been very satisfied with this vehicle.
Our most helpful agent was Lee Cox, and we decided to contact him recently about buying
another pre-owned car from Cavender Buick, now at 1604/281 (San Pedro Ave.) here in San Antonio, TX.  We had received several promotions from Mr. Cox and Cavender Buick through the mail, plus my husband Joe had seen some TV commercials by Mr. Cavender on good-quality preowned vehicles on stock.  Before we bought the LeSabre, we had acquired a preowned 1993 Park Avenue here in SA.  We like the smooth ride and
dependability of the Buicks.  

Service at Cavender Buick, particularly by agent H. Lee Cox, is the very best.
William, the financial officer, was helpful and professional also.  We plan to
continue doing business with Cavender Buick and Mr. Lee Cox in the future.
Satisfaction guaranteed *

Thank you.

63,"March 08, 2011","I want to start by saying this, ""I did not buy from Cavender"". The dealership was Great, My salesperson Monti was Great, but when it came down to price, I had another dealership beat their deal on a new GMC Acadia. Needless to say I bought from another dealership, and even though I may have saved a few hundred dollars on the price of my Acadia, I would have gladly paid double to get the Cavender experience back that I passed up.  I know that a new car is a car, no matter where you purchase it, but when it comes to the ""after buying experience"", I now know why they say ""you get what you pay for"".  I don't say this a lot, but I wish I had listened to my wife! My next car will be from Cavender, and I will only deal with Monti! I plan to service my Acadia with Cavender, and will not shop elsewhere in the future, as long as they keep a sales staff like Monti employed!
I just want to say thank you to Robert Cavender, and his Staff for helping me learn a life lesson, I look forward to doing future business.

He was not pushy or controlling like most car salesman and explained every question of mine in great detail.  He gave follow up calls to made sure I did not have anymore questions and to make sure I had the best experience ever.  This by far has been my #1 buying experience out of the 10 vehicles I have purchased in my lifetime. My wife and I enjoyed this experience and will be sending our friends to our new car salesman.
