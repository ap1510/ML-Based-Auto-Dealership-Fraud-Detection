0,"March 10, 2019","In the past I have bought a few vehicles at this location. But now they are GREAT, it was so easy and Mike Cosby went above and beyond to make sure I got what I needed. The new management has made such a huge difference. I called the dealership, spoke with mike, told him what I wanted, a few hours later he said co.e get it. I bought a 2019 lonestar, and got it $ 5000 less than other area dealers were offering . All around the best shopping experience of my life.",5.0
1,"December 31, 2016","I knew what truck I wanted  and what I was willing to pay before visiting dealer.  Ray helped me find a truck in Texas, and Tyler offered me a fair price. Dealership picked up the truck from another dealer 3 hours away and I had my new truck the next morning. ",5.0
