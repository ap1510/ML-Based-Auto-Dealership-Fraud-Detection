1,"February 06, 2018","In October 2017 a semi-trailer truck rear ended my Ford Fusion Energi and it was totaled. I liked the car so I decided to replace it with another Ford Fusion Energi. I couldn’t find one that was exactly the color and had the packages I wanted, but after contacting several dealerships Helfman Ford said they would order one for me. I was told it would take 8 weeks and it would certainly be available before the end of the year. Since my car had been totaled, I did not have a car but I though getting by for 8 weeks would only be somewhat inconvenient. I put down $2000 for them to order the car. The 8 weeks pass and I call to check on the status of the car. I am told the salesman is no longer working for them and they would look into the order and call me back. When they called me back they said it would be 2 more weeks before it was available. I asked this salesman if it would actually be 2 weeks or 2 months. He told me 2 weeks was probably too short and 2 months was probably too long and that the previous salesman had “overpromised”. I am told they will call me to keep me up to date on what is happening. Two weeks pass and no calls. Another week passes and I decide to call. The salesman tells me he will look into it and call me back in 10 minutes. Two hours pass and the he finally calls. I am told they don’t know what happened and it did not look like the car would be available at all. They do offer to refund my $2000, but I have been waiting 11 weeks, without a car, and I am told they do not know what happened. That is pretty much the definition of incompetence. Also, if I had not called them after 3 weeks I highly suspect I would still be waiting on their call.",1.0
2,"February 17, 2017","Took my car in twice, they didn't have all the parts needed to finish repair the first time. On second drop off I got a call saying they disconnected my battery and now car will not start they sent my car to mercedes in which then stated the one of the modules was fried. I told them I drove it in I expect to drive it out. 1600 dollars later and they claim it wasn't there fault. They were not qualified to work on a mercedes electric system so they shouldn't have an now I have to pay for it. Beware of Helfan they are not a credible collision center. I went online after the fact and now know their shady business practices.",1.0
