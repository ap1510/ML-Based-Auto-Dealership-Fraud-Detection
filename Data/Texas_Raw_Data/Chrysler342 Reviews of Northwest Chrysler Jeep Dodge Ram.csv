341,30-Oct-10,This was by far the best experience ever.  I purchased a Dodge Ram 1500 - Laramie and everything was flawless.   I was extremely impressed from the sale to the financing and could not say enough about NW Dodge.  Ronnie and Beto did a great job! The salesman event took his time to pick up my vehicle in Dallas and bring it back to Houston.  ,5
340,07-Apr-11,"Overall, the service was great!!! I was little disappointed they didn't wash me Dodge Challenger like I thought they would, I didn't have time to speak with the Service Manager about this, but I was a little upset, I hope it was just an oversight. Thank you ",4.8
338,09-May-11,"Raymond was very knowledge about the Charger and was aware of all the changes between our old 2006 model and this new one. The whole pricing / trade-in evaulation experience was great - no high pressure - no going back & forth  - very up front about our trade-in, financing, options - and the time needed to get some of our extras added  ",5
339,09-May-11,"This was the best car purchasing experience I have ever had.  I did not feel like anyone was trying to pull ""the wool over my head"".  I was honest in what I wanted and my price range and they helped me to leave with exactly what I wanted within my price range.  I would absolutely recommend this dealership and we will return next time we purchase a vehicle.",4.6
337,10-May-11,"Personally the best dealership i have stepped into!
Worked with me on a NO hagle deal, did exactly what they said they would do.
Was personally met, greeted and congratulated by the GM Mr. Jim Hatfield.
Dave Walters worked his butt off to make sure i was getting the best deal possible too!
All around great truck buying experience!",5
334,12-May-11,"Overall, buying our truck was a good expierence.  I do have a complaint with the finance department, as I started getting reject letters from finance companies, I realized that my social security number was incorrect, which ultimately closed the door to a better intrest rate.  Had they gotten my social correct the first time, I would have definitely gotten a better intrest rate in my opionion.  Otherwise, our expierence was good and the people were great.  Ken did a fantastic job and has since contacted us on several occasions to make sure everything is still going great.  Will definitely refer family and friends who are looking for simplicity and a good deal on a car.",4.2
335,12-May-11,MY CAR SALESMAN WAS DAVID PERRY. HE IS VERY COURTEOUS. HIS CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS GREAT AND MADE MY FIRST CAR PURCHASE A GREAT EXPERIENCE.DAVID CALLS PERIODICALLY TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS WELL WITH MY NEW VEHICLE. I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS DEALERSHIP TO FAMILY/FRIENDS.,4.8
336,12-May-11,"My sales person, Maggie was the best!  I was not looking to purchase a car at the time that she called me, however, she convinced me to come in and I decided to buy the Durango.  She worked dilligently to make sure that I received what I wanted and at the price I wanted.  I am very happy with my new 2011 Dodge Durango Crew. ",4.6
333,13-May-11,"I gave this rating because the customer service with Maggie and Raymond was and still is amazing. I love my vehicle and am very happy that I purchased from Northwest Dodge. I am completely satisfied with the price, quality of the vehicle, and experience with both Maggie and Raymond. ",5
332,14-May-11,"We went to NW Crysler, Jeep, Dodge to look for a little larger vehicle than we were currently driving. The lease on our Jeep Compass was closing, and we were very happy with it, but just needed a little more room.
We looked on-line at their inventory, and even chatted with a dealer representative about what we were looking for. An appointment was made for the following day and we met Kent Adams who helped us look at only the vehicles that we were interested in.
The entire visit was pleasant, and not at all like your horror stories commonly heard in times past. Not only did we get the vehicle that we wanted, but the deal was right as well. We would definitely recommend NW Dodge to any of our friends.",4.5
331,15-May-11,"I never give perfect scores because perfection is unobtainalbe, but to give this dealership anything less would be a grave injustice.

I would recommend this dealer and this sales person to anyone looking to purchase a vehcile.  The service is great and I and there was no pressure.  They put me first when buying the car and did not try to push anything on me that I could not afford or did not want.
",5
329,16-May-11,"Raymond, and the credit manager were great. I was looking for a used truck for my stepson, and found one, and they put me in it, and worked with me and made me feel like my business was important. I've purchased many cars and or trucks in the past and at many different dealers, but this by far was the best experience.  These guys sold my neighbor a new truck too, and now my wife doesn't like my truck anymore, so now I'm going to have to go back to see Raymond, and get a new Dodge, to replace my Chevy. I'm looking forward to the trip, and would tell anyone, ""GO HERE FIRST!!!""",5
330,16-May-11,"Dave Perry, the finance team and the General Manager are all ""Awesome"". They really care about making a buying experience comfortable and easy. Their commitment to detail on an individual basis is phenominal, as well as, their involvement with community organizations and devotion to our armed service men and women. No other dealer offers so much, and, a purchase is not necessary. No salesmen here, just friends. We purchased two new jeeps, one of which, is the ""All American"" custom jeep that Northwest created for a special event in honor of our ""Wounded Solders"".

With Warm Appreciation,
Michael & Kim Allen",5
326,17-May-11,"I had a nice experience with Northwest Dodge.  Jeff helped me find the perfect car for my family.  It fit everything I needed, and in my budget.  The finance department was great.  I would recommend this dealership to anyone.  The dealership was really nice and the staff were all very friendly and helpful.  ",5
327,17-May-11,My purchase at the this dealership was a great experience. Mr. Taylor showed me the Jeep I wanted to see and 2 hrs. later I was driving it home. They were friendly and quick.I would recommend this dealership to all my friends looking a new or used vehicle.,4.8
328,17-May-11,Jeff was a great guy! he really made me feel comfortable and extremely helped me alot!i would most definately recommend the dealership to one of my friends. Jeff made sure that I didnt leave without my car! he even arranged to have my previous vehicle towed to the dealership.,4.8
323,18-May-11,Jeff was a great sales person. He answered all my questions quickly. The entire deal was just about worked prior to me arriving at the dealership. Jeff located the specific color combination that I wanted and went and picked it up same day. The finance department was also very helpful and easy to work with. I think his name was Victor. I would recommend the dealership and both of these gentlemen for future business. ,5
324,18-May-11,"hassel free,fast and straight to the point.i would recommend everybody to go there great customer service.i was having other issues at another dealership so i found a car that i wanted at northwest dodge so i called he told me he could get me in that car and guess what he was not lying, which we know thats what you normally expect when dealing with car dealerships. Oh.....I love my Car!",5
325,18-May-11,"I came into this dealership really not looking for a new car.  I was just curious to see some of the new models.  A salesman Jeff took me around the parking lot and I ending up taking a few test drives.  By the end of the day I walked out with a new Dodge Nitro.  I love it!  The manager, salesman and finance manager met my every need.  I will continue to visit this dealership for my regular maintenance.  ",5
320,20-May-11,"Dan Paxton provided excellent service regarding showing me the type of vehicle I was interested in and negotiating the price to meet my needs. Treveor Krish provided excellent service regarding the final steps to include vehicle readiness and fill up of fuel. Both gentlmen did an outstanding job in performing their duties. 
Miguel also provided excellent service regarding the loan terms and each question I had while signing all documents. 

I had a wonderful experience at Northwest Dodge and will definately be back for future business.  ",5
321,20-May-11,"After being ""jerked"" around at another dealership we found a vehicle online at this one. Our experiance from start to finish was excellent.  Everyone was very professional and there was none of the stereo-typicall car dealer BS.  We recived a fair price for our trade and were able to see the invoice on the vehicle, it matched the invoce price on the web within $5, no copy machine tricks or folded paper.  We were in and out in a few hours, that included the washing and gas up of our Jeep, a trip to the bank and the paper work.  I highly recommend this dealership to my friends, family and anyone else.  I will be buying my next automobile here without question.",5
322,20-May-11,I had a great experience at the dealership and my salesman was on top of his game.  I believe I received the best possible deal considering the circumstances.  I would send anyone I know to Northwest Dodge for a new car purchase.  I appreciate the honesty and the exceptional assistance I received from Doug Daniels. ,5
316,21-May-11,"Nobody likes car salesmen, but Andrew treated us more like a friend than a customer. He was honest, friendly and worked hard on getting us the price we wanted. We never do this, but we liked him so much, after the sale, we bought him a burger. THAT is how you know you're dealing with a great salesman. We will continue to give Andrew our business when we are in the market for a new vehicle. ",4.6
317,21-May-11,"I WOULD LIKE TO THANK NORTH WEST DODGE INC FOR THE TREATMENT I AND MY FAMILY RECEIVED AT THE TIME WE WALKED INTO THE PREMISES TO LOOK FOR OUR 2011 DODGE DURANGO; WE WERE LUCKY TO BE RECEIVED BY MR KEN BAKER ONE OF YOUR PROFESSIONAL SALESMEN THERE WHO GAVE US THE CONFIDENCE NOT ONLY TO BUY THE NEW 2011 DODGE DURANGO CITADEL BUT ALSO TO BUY A NEW DODGE NITRO; MR BAKER SHOWED:

318,21-May-11,I buy a new car every year are so he is a no hassle salesman we bought one car then bought two cars with him in a two week period how many customers would do that we really like your dealership hope you take good care of him these kind of people are hard to find look foward to more deals with northwest .,5
319,21-May-11,"I had gone to the dealership to service my 2006 Jeep Grand Cherokee, and had been in the market for a new vehicle for some time.  As I started looking around, Doug Daniles came over an introduced himself.  Doug took the time to look through several of the 2011 Dodge Ram 1500 trucks they had on the lot with me.  We made our way through several vehicles before I found the one that made me say WOW!  It turned out to be a 2011 Dodge Ram 1500 Sport.  It was fully-loaded and looked great.  Then comes the fun part... working out the deal.  I had a number in mind that I could comfortably live with and would give me peace of mind.  Unfortunately, we we a ways apart initially on the price.  However, Doug kept after things and we were able to work out a great deal.  Car buying can be a bit of an anxious time, but Doug worked hard to make sure things went smoothly.  I am proud to say we were able to close the deal pretty quick, and I am the proud owner of that truck.  I would definitely recommend looking up Doug Daniels at Northwest Dodge if you are in the market for a new truck.",4.2
312,22-May-11,Ken Baker always anticipates my automobile needs and goes the extra mile to see that my needs are met.He makes me feel that I am his most important customer even though he is always busy. John Ogden Bellville TX.If the car I want is not available he will find it and keep the same price.He always answers his cell phone or calls me back promptly.Overall I have been very happy with this dealership even through the change in ownership,5
313,22-May-11,"We had an overall excellent experience except for a small blemish on one of the trucks Rambox cover. I am still waiting for it to be repaired.
The sales man is very knowledgeable and the pricing very competitive.
I will definitely return to this dealership.",4.8
314,22-May-11,I was in the market looking for a particular truck that was hard to find. Andrew worked very hard on getting the exact truck that I was looking for. He treated me more as a friend and that made it feel as there was no pressure compared to having a salesman be just a salesman. I will definitly be back to see him again when I'm in the market for a new vehicle. ,5
315,22-May-11,"Ken quickly cut through the usual red tape and saved me time by getting down to the best price quickly without having to spend wasted hours negotiating.  Ken obviously knows his vehicles and has a great grasp on how best to make a ggod deal.  In fact, Ken has sold me two new vehicles.  I specifically came back to Ken for the above reasons, as I do not like to sit and wait while un-experienced salesmen wander back and forth to the sales manager.  

Ken is highly recommended.",4.8
307,23-May-11,"This is the third vehicle I have purchased from Northwest Dodge/ Jersey Village. My first two experiences were somewhat time consuming, but this time the process was much quicker. I was also pleased with the fair trade-in value I recieved, and the motivation to help me find the best financing was great! Nice experience made possible by Jeffrey Taylor in sales, Ray in service, and the gentleman in financing in which,regretfully, I have forgotten his name.Thank you.",4.8
308,23-May-11,We have purchased a 2001 Dodge 1500 outdoors man. it was a great price and the saleman was on top of his game . we came in looking for a jeep .after talking to Ken he told me the jeep wasnt what i need it was a truck instead he was right Thank ken for helping us,5
309,23-May-11,My experience with Ken Baker brought me back to your dealership buying four cars in the past year or so.  Ken made my car buying experience a pleasure. He is very knowledgeable in all areas of the business. I also had great luck working with finance and overall management.   Thanks for the great service.,4.4
310,23-May-11,"I really appreciated the eagerness to help and the friendliness of Mr. Baker!  He made me feel welcome to the dealership and was happy to help grab as much information abou the vehicles we looked at.  Even gave us more options and changed our minds from what we originally came in for.  We started off looking for a Jeep and when we told Mr. Baker what it was for, he suggested the Dodge Outdoorsman package on the pickups and met everything we needed plus some!  ",5
311,23-May-11,"We have dealt with Ken for a number of years which is why we keep returning to this dealership. He gives you the facts you need, finds the car you want at a price you can afford and is not over the top aggressive like some of the other dealerships we have been in (and not returned to.)",5
302,24-May-11,"I have given the above review of your dealership for two reasons. First of all the proximity to my house, and the wide asortment of new and used vehicles. Secondly, and the main reason is for Ken Baker! I have purchased two vehicles from Ken and would not buy from anyone else as long as he had a comprable vehicle. I have visited Ken on many occaisions to look,kick tires and buy a vehicle. Everytime Ken has taken time, and provided quality, knowledge, and profesionalism. I have sent several people to Northwest Dodge with the instruction to ask for Ken specifically. Although they may not have purchased a vehicle they had nothing but high remarks about the  service they recieved from Ken. I and my family look forward to many dealings with Ken Baker at Northwest Dodge.
Thank You,
Robert Sumpter ",5
303,24-May-11,"My overall experience was good. Salsperson Maggie was very friendly and assisted me with my first Jeep purchase and I love my vehicle.  The service team has also been very helpful in assisting with needs and returning phone calls. Took a little while t get new promotion with purchase under control,pleased in the end. Will recommend this dealership and Maggie to others!",3.8
304,24-May-11,"Andrew G as Northwest dodge went above and beyond assisting me with my sale.  He Isn't a pushy sales person, which is the main reason why I made the purchase.  He also knew most of the technical specs of the vehicle off the top of his head.

Thanks!  I'll definitely be coming back.",5
305,24-May-11,jeff taylor did an outstanding job for me he got me in the truck i wanted for the price i wanted to pay he got me the money i wanted for my trade miguel in the finance department did a great job too i will recomend my friends and family to this dealership great job guys thanks.,5
306,24-May-11,"Ken has sold us multiple vehicles in the past years and he is the reason why we continue to do business at Northwest Dodge. We had a not so great experience when we purchased our last vehicle(on the part of previous management)however, we feel very honored to be severed by Ken so we continue to return. ",5
300,25-May-11,"They didnt seem to all be on the same page. Original appointment was made with one rep, then when we got to the dealership we were put with another rep, due to first rep was busy. Rep we were put with was also with another customer, and tried to handle both at the same time, leaving my husband and myself a little dissatisfied with the situation. We ended up leaving and calling back the next day to speak with Nick Hill to resolve the situation. 

We ended up getting the service we desired from Maggie, and she the best job she knew how to, in order to make sure we got the vehicle we wanted for the price we were looking for. The only other issue was that a brand new car, had transmission issues that left us paying for a brand new car with mechanical issues. This was originally a concern to us, as we were unsure what the repairs would do to the value of the vehicle. We were assured it would not de-value the unit, and were also told if issue continued, we would be able to look at option of switching unit out for what we had originally thought we purchased-- a NEW CAR with NO PROBLEMS. 

The service was performed in a timely manner, and overall the experience was just ok. A suggestion for the dealership would be to make sure that sales reps inform customers of their schedule at the dealership, so that customers are not calling up there or stopping by trying to purchase a vehicle or resolve issues and feel like they are being put on the back burner because the sales rep is out that day. ",3.6
301,25-May-11,"Jeff Taylor's attitude with a haggling customer was terriffic.  he was very understanding, not pushy, but made the deal.  I see why he has been the top Salesman for every month this year.  Northwest Dodge should really appreciate having Jeff on staff.",5
297,26-May-11,My experience with Ken Baker at Northwest Dodge in Houston was great. I have not dealt with a sales person as real as he was. He led me to a great service tech for work on my current truck. He also exhausted himself working with me on my trades and down payment to keep me where I wanted to be. I felt safe and comfortable and will return for all of my automobile needs.,5
298,26-May-11,"Ken .. Baker.. Has helped me out on several occastions. He was a fantastic dealer, even though i called him a million times. He was patient, and understanding. Tried his best to work everything out for the better....

I would reccommend him to any and everyone that needs a new car. 
Plus i am sure he can sway anyone to a dodge. ",5
299,26-May-11,"I WAS ON THE MARKET FOR A NEW TRUCK FOR PERSONAL USE, AND FOR MY COMPANY AS WELL. I HAD SHOPPED AROUND AT ALL MY LOCAL DEALERSHIPS AND FOUND THAT MOST WERE VERY INFORMITIVE, BUT WHEN I SHOPPED AT NORTHWEST DODGE, KEN BAKER DID NOT FORCE HIMSELF UPON ME. HE MADE IT CLEAR HE WAS AVAILABLE IF HIS SERVICES WERE NEEDED. HE WAS ON STAND BY FOR A FEW HOURS WHILE I BROWSED. ONCE I HAD MY QUESTIONS IN ORDER, HE WAS EXCITED TO GET STARTED IN HELPING ME FIND THE BEST TRUCK FOR ME, AND THEN FOR MY COMPANY. HE WAS ABLE TO LOCATE A VEHICLE THAT WOULD BEST SUIT ME AND MY FINANCIAL NEEDS. HE WAS EAGER TO MAKE SURE THAT I WAS COMPLETELY SATISFIED AND COVERED MANY DIFFERENT SCENARIOS THAT WOULD BEST SUIT ME. I WAS EXTREMELY COMFORTABLE WITH KEN FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. I HAVE SINCE BOUGHT 5 TRUCKS FROM HIM AND MY COMPANY HAS BOUGHT 4. I HAVE SENT MANY OF MY FRIENDS AND COWORKERS TO SEE KEN AS WELL, AND THEY ALL EXPRESSED THEIR EXCITEMENT IN DEALING WITH KEN. HE IS A TRUE ASSET TO NORTHWEST DODGE, AND I PLAN TO DO BUSINESS AGAIN WITH HIM AND NORTHWEST DODGE OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS AGAIN.",5
296,27-May-11,When I purchased a vehicle from ken baker from northwest dodge I felt that our transaction was real genuine. He treated me with respect And really took the time to focuse on what I was looking for. I would recommend this dealer ship to any one due to such a positive experience with this seller. I love my new dodge thanks ken!,5
295,28-May-11,"The customer service was impacciable,we were met by Ken Baker immediately and he went over and above to guaranty that all our needs and concerns were met.WE could not have ask for a more efficient salesperson to help us through the process.Ken always had a smile and made us feel confortable.After having the expierence of the accident earlier in the week, and the stress that came along with it,  it was very refressing to have Ken as our salesman.All things considered the pricing was good,and we would defintely recommend the dealership to anyone looking to purchase a vechile new or used.Ken made sure to give us all the options avaiable.(new and used)",4.8
294,29-May-11,Ken did an awesome job fixing me up with my used Dodge Grand Caravan in November 2009. The service could not have been better. On follow up issues Ken continued to exceed all expectations so that all matters were dealt with to my complete satisfaction. I would have no hesitation recommending Ken or returning to him with repeat business.,5
292,31-May-11,"
Thank you for offering this survey.  I have just had one of my best experiences buying a car... EVER!!!  Ken was absolutely Perfect to work with.  He gave me just enough information to let me make my own decisions and not the 'pushy' salesman I experienced at another dealership.  Loved Him.  Also the Sales Manager,  Sterling was everything you would want in a Manager.  With a winning team like these guys, I will definately refer my friends to your location.  And on a seperate note.  I live in southwest Houston and drove to the 290 location because of these incredible gentlemen.  
Thank you to Northwest Dodge.
Vicky Hayes",5
293,31-May-11,was very friendly...worked fast and never pressured me at all...was very comfortable working with Ken..would definately go back to him to buy another car...and person in the finance department was very nice too.....will come back to your dealership...    ,4.8
290,01-Jun-11,"I bought my wife a Grand Caravan in Dec '07 from Northwest Dodge, and the experience told me I'd never be back.  I knew I'd be buying myself a Wrangler Memorial Weekend, so I started shopping in April.  I went to several dealers in the Houston area except NW Dodge, unsuccessfully.  Went to a club meeting with the TX4WD Tomball/Conroe chapter, and a Houston Jeeper told me I had to go back to NW Dodge and speak with Jim.  ""He sponsors our club and the Wounded Warriors"".  So I went back to NW Dodge, and was pleasantly surprised.  They had new owners, a new manager, and a new attitude since my last visit there.  I made the deal I wanted, got the Jeep I wanted, and was actually pleased with my new Jeep purchasing experience.  I have to thank the TX4WD Tomball/Conroe Chapter and The Houston Jeep People for talking me into going back to NW Dodge.  It was low pressure, comfortable, and I saved a couple thousand dollars (Thank You Tread Lightly)!  I will be back to get my wife the 20-- Grand Caravan when the time comes.",4.8
291,01-Jun-11,Ken started as a salesman and ended up as a friend. What a great person he is. He was honest from the start and did his best to beat a low internet offer I had from a different dealed. I keep going back to just say hi and i will for sure buy my next car from him. I only wish the service department is as good as the sales.....I had to wait more than two hours for an oil change. It is good I guess that I had Ken to visit with.,5
289,04-Jun-11,"Went to Tomball Dodge first. Haggled over prices of vehicle and trade-in for 4 hours. Could not come to acceptable terms. Understand it is a business and a business needs to make profit, but I felt like I was at village market haggling over money. Left there and went to Northwest Dodge. Sat down with Ken Baker. Told him what I was looking for 2011 Dodge Durango. Pulled up a list of inventory on his computer. Told me straight forward what he could do and that was that. Bottom line. He was very straight forward and honest. I wish that had been our first stop but luckily it was our last. He sent us to the finance department while new Durango was being detailed. I can not remember the gentleman's name who we dealt with but he was the same. Straight forward and to the point. I told him I wanted to go with my credit union and all he asked for was a chance to beat them. Told him he had to beat 5 years at 3.75%. In about 10 seconds he said he could do it for 3.69. Impressed. He handled paperwork fast and thouroughly because he understood we had no time to waste. Entire experience was pleasant and would recommend dealership and new Durango. Only complaint is Dodge website uses Kelly Blue Book to compare trade-in values but the dealership does not.They use NADA which is quite lower. This should be addressed.

288,07-Jul-11,The experience at Northwest Dodge was great because we were able to leave with exactly what we travelled there for (4 door 1500 Dodge Ram Hemi) and the price was right!!,5
287,01-Aug-11,"I bought a 2010 Dodge Ram 3500 in November from Northwest Dodge in Houston, Texas. When I test drove the vehicle, the only problem I noticed was a slight vibration. I told my salesman, Raymond Bennett about the vibration and he said that it would be fixed after the Thanksgiving holiday. Raymond said the vibration might come from the tires/rims that were on the vehicle. I found out that the tires/rims on the truck were aftermarket and they were installed by the dealership(before I bought the truck, they called it the Ranch Hand Package) and not Dodge Corp. I can't take the truck to any other dealership because they will not look at the truck because of the rims/tires on it. 
I brought the truck back in December, not realizing they would have the truck for two weeks. During this time I recieved a few phone calls on status updates, any other time I called I had to leave a message and got no response. I did speak with the GM Jim Hatfield because service was not returning my phone calls. When I picked up the truck the vibration was still there. 
I brought the truck back in January again because the vibration was still there. They had the truck for month this time and when I picked it up...the vibration was still there!
I spoke with the sales manager at that time, Ryan Atlaw. I asked him if he could have the stock tires/rims put on the truck and I recieve some kind of montary compensation for the price of the aftermarket rims/tires they would be taking off. He said the he was not allowed to authorize that and I would have to speak with the GM. I tried to speak with the GM, my wife even wrote him a email and he never responed. He was avoiding my phone calls. 
I was referred by a Northwest Dodge employee to contact my finance company. My finance company referred me to Dodge Customer Service. I filed a claim with Dodge Customer Service. Dodge Customer Service contacted the dealership and spoke with Ryan Atlaw. He agreed to have the stock rims/tires put back on the truck and go from there. Maybe five - ten minutes late the GM contacted Dodge Customer Service and told them that he refused to fix the truck based on pervious conversations that he had with me. I only spoke with the man once and the conversation was fine. 
I contacted a lemon law attorney but was unable to file a lemon law claim because it was a modifcation that the dealer did not something that Dodge corporation did to the truck. Also, I did not have enought repair records for the same problem. 
I attempted to take the dealer to arbitration as per the agreement I signed when I purchased the truck. Northwest Dodge did not respond to arbitration and they lost their contract with American Arbirtators. 
I recently took the truck back to the service dept at Northwest Dodge. A different service person looked at the truck and said that the front passenger tire was cupping. He recommended that I rotate the tires to help with the cupping. He also said that I needed to get the suspension looked at as well. They rotated the tires that day. When I came home I noticed that the tires had not been rotated at all! I went back to the dealer and spoke with the serivce manager Roy Henderson. Roy was very helpful, wanted to help me and also returns phone calls. He refunded my 40.00 dollars I paid for the rotation and was going to have the tires rotated for real this time. Roy and another service guy, Russell, came back to me and said that the tires were not able to be rotated. Russell explain the reason why the tires could not be rotated and he was very helpful. Both Roy and Russell said that the would get with the GM and sales manager to address the problem. The GM told them that since we refused the solution to put stock rims/tires back on the truck then he can not do anything to fix the truck further. Putting the stock rims/tires on the truck was my solution, he is the one to refused to fix the truck. 
I paid 61,000 dollars for this truck and I expect to have a truck that runs good not one that vibrates. The dealership has no sense of customer service. I wish I had looked up reviews before I bought the truck from them because they are all bad! Buyers Beware!",2
285,24-Aug-11,"I came in with a mailer saying that i would be able to get more for my trade and free gas for a year. I was told they could not honor that for reasons mumbo jumbo to me? That was what got me through the door in the first place. When i finally made a deal on a car, it was sold from another dealer. i had to wait three days for them to find me one. When i did get my car it  had over 200 miles on it already. Over all my experience was OK.",3.6
286,24-Aug-11,"I had the best experience here at Northwest Dodge.  Due to credit issues I didnt believe I could finance a car, I called the Dealership and just happened to get connected to Raymond Bennett, who was a professional, he got me in a New car no money down, I was in and out within 3 hours, with my new car.  I love that guy!",5
284,07-Nov-11,"I went into this dealership to buy a used car that had been on their lot for over 75 days. I had the misfortune of dealing with the manager, Feras/Firas. He was extremely rude, discourteous, and a true nightmare to deal with. When I asked about the price and tried to negotiate a little on price, he outright refused and told me the list price was the FINAL price. He would not even budge by $1.00, which showed me that he clearly did not care for my business. I didn't want an outrageous discount, but a little bit of flexibility would have been nice and expected in a used car sale. He did not even bother to talk to me directly, but instead sent the salesperson over with a huge red inked FINAL PRICE on the top of the page. He made it seem like I was shopping at a department store where there is no haggling or space on the price. I did not have a problem with the price, but the way in which Feras handled the situation was shocking and insulting. I would NEVER recommend this dealership to any of my friends or family members. This dealership does not understand the meaning of &quot;customer service.&quot; ",1
283,25-Apr-12,"I contacted this Dealership over the internet. Jerold Jones contacted me back. I told him i was in touch with 7 other dealerships via the Internet and wanted his best price on a Wrangler Unlimited Sport. First he asked what the best price I had was and said he would match it. I told him I wouldn't bargain that way, I would give my business to the person that gave me the best price! He gave me a price that was well below anyone elses. when I took that price to the other dealerships, they all told me there was no way he could sell me a Unlimited Wrangler at that price. A couple even told me to send the Window Sticker off of Northwest's website. When they and I tried to retrieve it again it said invalid vin#. Jerold said thats the way it reads when it has sold! Also the dealership website posted a coupon for $500. It read; negotiate your best deal then give the coupon to your sales person. He claimed that was already figured in the price!  There is nothing worse than being lied to in your initial conversation with a sales person. They think customers don't have any common sense! I printed off all the info and coupon before it came up as invalid vin# My suggestion is stay away from this dealership, I have a feeling this is common practice!

282,01-Jun-12,"Terrible Experiences. Will never go back. First, the service department got grease all over the suede part of my seats during an oil change. They were very disrespectful during the whole process. That was a year ago. I decided to give them a second chance last week. I went to buy a new wrangler and chose a white one that was located in a different city. Great price on it and my trade in. I was very happy. It was supposed to arrive the next day and instead of getting a call to say it had arrived, they said the jeep I bought had been sold and there were no other white jeeps in the entire country. They ""searched"" for 2 days and I ended up goin and getting my trade in. They didn't apologize at all... Did not care about me whatsoever.",2.2
281,22-Oct-12,"I have a 2009 dodge ram 4x4 crew cab with a lifetime powertrain warranty that I purchased from this dealership. I have taken my truck here for all but two of my oil changes and rebuild of a rear differential failure due to poor design with no problems,  but lately I must say it has been a nightmare to have my truck serviced there. It has been in the shop for cylinder 3 misfire since July 23, 2012 and it is STILL there. Now this misfire has been occurring since March of 2011 in which case they did an ""RR"" type of repair to ""fix"" it. Well here we are October 22, 2012 still not fixed. The dealership has replaced the cylinder head, lifters, rocker arms, oil channels, injectors, and computer and told me to pick it up Aug 2, 2012 that it was ready. Well no sooner than I get into my truck I notice it runs rougher and as soon as I take it out of the dealership the engine light comes on, so I immediately turn around and tell the service advisor A.J.  it’s NOT fixed. For about 2 months they try to do little tricks and such to get it running correctly and still nothing. So a ""Chrysler"" field rep inspects the vehicle and determines it’s a bent rod. Which then the dealership says its water damage and wont honor the lifetime warranty. They have not shown me the ""evidence” as to how it was determined water damaged and I have spoken to the actual tech that did the work in the presence of my service advisor A.J. and asked him if he noticed water damage, he said none was detected. AS for a bent rod, there are other ways to bend one not just water damage such as if a valve drops too far and hits a cylinder, basically a mechanical malfunction or a defective rod. When I picked up the truck nothing on the invoice stated water damage, I am familiar with what water damage consists of and it looks like a chocolate milkshake when you drain the oil. Especially when you pull the cylinder head off it would be very noticeable. Water would be in transmission and in both differentials and none was indicated on my invoice. I would have to have this truck up to the headlights in water with the inside of the cab soaked which would smell like mold by now since it’s been in the dealerships possession for THREE months. The service manager ""ERIC"" tell me that there is no clearance between the cylinder and the head so that if you took a spray bottle and sprayed into the intake it could bend a rod. So I told ERIC, ""What happens when I take my truck through fog, car wash, or just rain on the freeway?"" Ridiculous!! 
Spoke with the General Manager ""JIM Hatfield"" was totally clueless and not helpful. They tried to give me my truck back on OCT 19, 2012 on an empty tank still not fixed with Jim saying ""it’s not going to break down on you"", yet this man clearly admitted to knowing nothing about the mechanics of his product. Immediately I questioned where have they driven my truck since I left it with 3/4 tank full. The service writer “A.J.” admitted to taking my truck home just to make sure it runs right. That’s over 300 miles driven; I believe water damage that happened to my truck occurred while in the dealerships’ possession since it has rained in three months’ time. I have been in constant contact with Chrysler customer care and they have submitted a ""corrective action"" complaint and have gone above the area manager's head ""Steve Euhen"" because his handling of this is very unprofessional and has not returned any of the emails or phone calls of my Chrysler customer care manager in over a month. Being that I’m on medical orders from an injury I sustained I need my truck to get to doctors and physical therapy and when I return to full duty I will go on to training and I need my truck!! I feel totally taken advantage of with the unprofessionalism that this dealership has displayed to me and I will NOT recommend them to my fellow soldiers, family, and friends. If you buy a dodge, DONT BUY IT FROM NORTHWEST OR GET IT SERVICED THERE!!

279,27-Jan-13,"We liked Duke Montross, Internet Sales Manger. Everyone at the dealership was friendly and courteous. 
I had been looking for a used Jeep Wrangler, off and on, for about 6 mos. I saw one advertised by Northwest on Autotrader.com (as well as some other sites, including their own). I checked Northwest's site and it was listed there. I received a window asking if I needed to talk. I was able to instant message with Janell Standley and found out the Jeep I was interested in was available. We then talked by phone and told her my wife and I were going to come look at the Jeep, but we were driving about 40 - 50 miles and to make sure she had the vehicle and keys, she agreed. Arrived at the dealership and was advised that Ms Standley was at lunch and salesman, Duke Montross would help me. Ms Standley is not a sales person. Our sales person was Duke Montross. My wife and I both liked Duke, he was kinda laid back, not pushy and from what I could tell answered our questions to the best of his knowledge. I test drove the vehicle, my wife and I discussed the vehicle, and started talking deal with Duke. Duke talked about getting some extra things done, oil drain plug, repositioning the top, a couple of tires, and a better spare tire. Duke told us a price $1000.00 more than the internet. I produced a print out of the price advertised on autotrader.com and their website. It appears Duke nor his sales manager (I think his name was Rick Lester) knew the price on the internet. They agreed to abide by the price advertised without a fuss. We agreed on the price and that they would take care of the oil drain plug and repositioning the top, but would have to see about the tires. It was also agreed upon that we would have a chance to have our mechanic check the vehicle out for any major problems and if a major problem was found we could return the vehicle. I presented the $500 off coupon from their website. Duke advised that they would not give another $500 off, something about it did not apply to this and was already in there. I requested the manager tell us. Duke, the manager, my wife and I went out to the vehicle. The manager told us he would honor the $500 off coupon, and he would still take care of the Oil drain plug problem and the repositioning the top, but could not do anything on the tires. We felt the deal was fair and agreed. Finance Manager, Moises Avila, is who we did all the paperwork with. He was very knowledgeable and friendly. We had questioned another charge on the paperwork and Mr. Avila advised us that he had gotten it waved. We also did not have any problems with getting the addition of our mechanic review added to the Final Sales Agreement. We purchased the vehicle and drove it home that night. ",4.6

It took him several days to help me find the perfect Jeep but he kept telling me to ""stick with him"" and we would get it done.  I will definitely recommend him and the dealership to my friends.  From Reece in sales, Ernest in finance and Susan who delivered our Jeep, it was an enjoyable experience.",4.8

Reese ensured that I didn't leave without a new set of keys. He worked with the finance person to get me a great deal and it was well worth the wait (which wasn't very long). I really appreciate the phenomenal service that was provided not only by him but by the women in the ""wrap up department"". Overall I had a great experience from begining to end and am very happy with my new vehicle.",5

I would recommend Northwest Dodge and especially Duke Montross for your next vehicle.",5
270,20-Feb-13,"Reece Broussard was great! I had been researching a Camry on Autotrader for a couple of months-this one popped up at a fair price-while I was doing the loan application the computer dropped the price $1,000. I expected resistance from Reece on the reduction, but he took that in stride and we continued at the new reduced price. In 2009 I bought a 2007 Camry in Arlington through Autotrader and that worked out well also. I live in San Antonio and both times it has been worth the time  and travel to leave San Antonio to purchase a vehicle. My experiences and those of friends here in SA have been nothing short of putrid. The salesmen are incredible manipulators and liars- the finance people are very skilled at taking advantage of anyone who has not done their research and does not understand that one does not need a useless ""extended warranty"" and GAP insurance and extending a loan to the ridiculous time frame of 72 months!They take adavantage of your ignorance-educate yourself!!! Walk away unless you completely understand ALL  the numbers!!!!! Vultures is the best term I could use in print.The same vehicle in San Antonio would have cost at least $3,000. more. No drama with Reece-all this boils down to 5 words--Do your research! See Reece!",5
269,23-Feb-13,"Reece called me about a new truck after another dealership declined to finance me, this was totally unexpected and shows that he remembers past customers. He also remembered and asked about my wife and son as we have all purchased vehicles through him before, this set me at ease and reminded me why we enjoy dealing with Reece and will continue to do so. I travelled over an hour to this dealership to see if they could beat some of the other dealerships that I had researched on-line, they not only beat the other dealerships but Reece and the team had to go the extra mile to get me approved as I had a few items that presented challenges. Reece kept me informed every step of the way especially the finance portion and made sure that I understood and explained in detail what was occuring. My overall experience was great and it was nice to see everyone that worked there smiling and asking if I had been taken care of or if I needed a drink. I will recommend this dealership to all my freinds and family that want to have a great car buying experience.",5

My wife was able to take her time and pick what she wanted without feeling pushed and persuaded by sales talk like many consumers are familiar with. Being we are from out of state, and my wife and I weren't able to be at the dealership at the same time, Reece and the Finance department catered to our needs on the paperwork and made it a smooth transition for our trade-in and purchase.

261,09-Aug-13,"When we walked in Northwest Dodge there was no one around. Everyone was either busy or at their desk on the computer or eating. After we waited patiently for a minimum of 15 minutes and did not get any service, we approached the desk of William Thomas, JR. as he was eating at his desk. We asked him if he could help us and he said sure! The customer should not have to approach the salesman. Anyhow, we saw a vehicle online we liked and William explained that the internet price was not the sticker price, so pretty much the price listed online was not matching up to his offer. OK, so lets test drive the vehicle! William explained that the vehicle was not ready to be driven so we 
can come back the next day to test drive and he will have it ready. Wrong. William called us asking if we were coming back the next day and also asked about our financials, etc. We explained we were interested in the vehicle and agreed on price but still wanted to do a test drive before making our final decision. In the meantime we got paperwork ready and it was submitted to our personal credit union for further review, so once we drove the vehicle we could drive out. Again, the vehicle was not able to drive when came back the next day. William was calling our credit union asking about a check and not worried about satisfying his customer but himself. The paper work arrived at our credit union with approximately $1000 in extra charges that we were unaware of. We immediately called William and he said come in and he will take care of it. Once again, we arrived and had to wait for service. We would have appreciated someone else being available to help us or William to say, you guys go test drive the vehicle and I will be with you when you get back. Unfortunately the vehicle was not ready. At this time we were beyond upset because we had to wait around and then got asked to come in and the vehicle was not ready as promised, then there were unexplained charges added to the total price! What is going on? We had also left a deposit so the vehicle would not get sold. When we asked to speak to a manger, William hesitated and did not get the manager. He continuously tried to explain things himself which were unnecessary because at this point I was an extremely dissatisfied customer he did not get the manager for us as requested. I walked to the booth where the managers sit and  requested for my deposit back. The managers response was, ""WAIT I'll be right with you!"" I kindly said ""No, Thanks, we have been waiting long enough"" I got my check back and left the dealership. Till this day I hate that we wasted all that time at Northwest Dodge and I will never go back there nor recommend them to anyone. ",2.2
260,30-Sep-13,This was the worst car buying experience I've ever experienced! Walked in and everyone was too busy to assist my wife and I. We were interested in purchasing a 2014 jeep grand cherokee summit and were overlooked from the initial contact. I had to walk around the dealers lot myself and find a young salesman whom was jumping a truck trying to get it to start. Never has this happened to me and never will I visit this dealership again. I will never beg a dealership to take my hard earned money and take time out for a customer. I took my business to river oaks jeep and i must say they definitely know what customer service is!! ,1.2
259,07-Nov-13,"From the very beginning Rick was honest, helpful, and polite.  This was the first dealership I went to when I started looking and I let him know up front that I didn't even know what I wanted yet.  He was very patient and let me browse without hovering so I could have time to decide what I liked and did not like.  Even though he wasn't around, he seemed to pop up when I had a question about something.  He would politely answer and let me return to browsing.  I never felt like I was being pressured into purchasing a vehicle.  Needing to be sure I was getting a good deal I went to another dealer.  They promised me they could get to a predetermined price with the features I wanted and tricked me in to driving to their dealership during inclement weather.  Once there, they could not deliver on their price.  I went back to Rick and told him my experience.  Unlike them, he was once again honest with me telling me he could not get to that price.  Reasons were the same as theirs, the vehicle with the features I wanted all had extras that I didn't want causing the price to go up.  Rick was determined to find me a Jeep and expanded his search.  We finally found the one I was looking for.  The walk out price was within $500 of the predetermined price from the other dealer and was a match for my budget.  I have purchased many cars in my past and REALLY wish there were more salesmen like Rick who made the experience as enjoyable and stress free as possibe.  Purchasing a new vehicle should be and exciting time, not riddled with arguing about price and features.  Rick easily made this the most pleasant vehicle purchase I have ever made.",5

Took it to Northwest dodge and the looked at it and tightened them up. Several months later the rails became loose and a bolt fell out. and when we stepped on the rail the front part of the rail popped off. Now I am back at Northwest Dodge trying to get it fixed and the service manager (Paul) is more worried about who is to blame. He is worried about who put the rails on. I explained to him It came with the truck when I bought it from his dealer ship.  (part of the express package) Instead of just advising that they would take care of it, he wants to post blame on something or someone. The vehicle is still under the bumper to bumper warranty a new truck. I bought this vehicle thinking it would last.  I would not recomend the Dealer ship to anyone. They get you then stick it to you.

After waiting days for them to get back to me and me trying to talk to the loan department myself i got an approved loan from the bank and put a deposit on the car!  I already switched my insurance over to the new vehicle and cancelled my extended warranty and gap insurance on my trade in which already had a trade in value in the loan contract.  After spending a couple hundred dollars switching the sensors from my aftermarket rims back onto the stock rims and submitting paperwork (that was rushed through as a courtesy) requesting a day off from my duties as i am a doctor in the US Army i was ON MY WAY to pick up my new vehicle when i received a call from the dealership manager (not LJ) telling me there was no point in me coming in to pick up my new car anymore because they sold it to somebody else just then and that i was out of luck!!!!  I was stunned to say the least!!!  After telling them but i already had an approved loan and they already had my deposit on the car they told me ""well sorry maybe if you had an 800 credit score it would be different!!!!!!""  I then told them i wanted my deposit back that day, needless to say i was very disappointed, or i would call a lawyer the manager then told me ""fine have your lawyer call our lawyers"" and then he hung up on me!!!!!

235,30-Apr-14,"If you saw my driveway and how many cars had ""Northwest"" on them you'd know...
2010 Challenger, 2013 Wrangler, 2014 Ram 1500.
I've been entirely pleased with the automotive experience at Northwest Dodge.  From sales to service, I've always been treated with exceptional friendliness.

236,30-Apr-14,"Overall the experience was pretty good. They were anxious to get me in a used vehicle they were wanting to sell. I did not see the final numbers until I was in the finance area. I took the deal but they could have shown me all options for the price I would be paying. (i.e. I could have gotten a new vehicle for the price of the used one.) Once in the finance area however, I took the deal. I had some buyers remorse later because I did not look at all my options. But a lot of this was my fault for not thinking it through.",4.4
237,30-Apr-14,"We drove into the parking and Brandon immediately came up, introduced himself and proceed to show us the jeeps.  Brandon was extremely knowledgeable and was able to answer all or our questions.   There was no pressure to purchase and when they did not have the actual jeep we wanted, Brandon was quick to search and find us one.  

Since the purchase Brandon has been in touch to assure we are happy and do not have any problems with the vehicle.

After looking at several dealerships, Brandon was polite, knowledgable and allowed us time to make a decision without being pushy.  We did buy the same day from Brandon and if I had a dealer ship, he would be the type of representative I would want.",5
232,01-May-14,"its a great dalership because since the moment my family and i steped out of our car, a friendly face was there, waiting for us. Got my new 2014 challenger!! dream come true! :)",5
233,01-May-14,Oscar Torres was very helpful and patient with me and my daughter. We looked at several vehicles and we found one that we liked. Oscar took the time to listen to my needs and wants on a vehicle and found one that fit my family. Thank You again for your help and service. I will definitely send my friends and family to him and this dealership. ,4.8
231,08-May-14,This experience was the easiest and most friendliest purchase of an auto i have ever made. The time to do this was about 2 hours when i drove off the lot. Travis was very friendly and knowledgeable about the Challenger i purchased. He never made me feel pressured or stupid for asking questions. I called him on Tuesday afternoon to tell him i would be in for my test drive and he was completely ready when i got there. it was the most pleasant experience i have had with purchasing an auto. I would also like to say that the financing manager Billy was very easy to deal with as well. Thank you for a great purchasing experience.,4.8
230,11-May-14,Maggie as well as the credit department were great and easy to work with. A much different experience than we have had at different dealerships with other car purchases. We will definitely be back for our next car purchase!,5

227,19-May-14,"I have gone through the new car buying process several times now, and I always seem to have to prepare myself mentally with the hassles of the typical new care salesperson. They usually have their typical routine of how they screw people over. I was pleasently surprised with how amazing Maggie Prokos was during the my jeep wrangler purchase experience. I'm not going to lie, I went in ready to play ""bad cop"" and put up a fight for what I wanted but I quickly found out that wasn't necessary with Maggie. Not only did she make the entire process flow seamlessly, but she made it enjoyable and I really felt like I had known her for years. If I ever need to purchase another vehicle, there is no way I would consider going to anyone other than maggie again. ",5
226,09-Jun-14,"Avoid this car dealer's service department. Communication is atrocious. They will not inform you about the length of time necessary to perform service or repairs. I scheduled an appointment for service and was told to arrive early the next day. I called back later in the day to check status and to determine what time I should expect service to be complete. Only to be informed that no work had been conducted on my car that day and that it wouldn't be assessed until the next day due to the back-log of vehicles requiring service. 

When I asked why they didn't tell me to bring it in tomorrow if they couldn't service it until then they seemed incredulous and wondered why I would do that as it would push my vehicle even further back into the service queue and may not get looked at for another couple of days as the back-log tended to build during the week. 

I reluctantly agreed to leave it but asked if they would perform service the next day.The response was ""yes"". The following day the report was that they had sucessfully changed my oil and planned to move onto my additional service requests the next day. Two days for an oil change? When I asked whether they investigated my chief complaint, a steering related problem, they informed me that they intended to do that tomorrow. 

The next day they informed me that they had investigated my steering problem and would order the necessary parts. Order parts? Isn't this a car dealership with a service department? A dealership that sells the brand of vehicle for which I requested service? Isn't a dealership service depatment where OEM parts are stored and come from when you take you car to a non-dealer for service? 

The following day they informed me they had performed the alignment on my vehicle which seemed odd as they had not corrected any steering related work since the parts had not yet arrived. I lost confidence in this dealership's service department (and was stunned by the unbelievable estimate for repairs) so I collected my vehicle after four days. I was charged for an oil change and an alignment which the subsequent repair shop stated would have been physically impossible to complete due to the damage in the rack and pinnion linkage and the wear on one of the tie-rod ends. 

The service manager promised a full refund for the oil change and the impossible alginment. After more than two months, I've given up any hope of every seeing that refund. I initiated all communication, never once receiving a call from the service department to provide me with a status report or estimates. 

Do yourself a favor, steer clear of Northwes Dodge Service Department. Worst service I've been experienced in a very long time. ",1
225,21-Jun-14,"Travis  went above and beyond, he picked a great SUV for us and got us a rebate. Travis is a great sales person, excellent at his job, and he's a people person. Travis cares so much about his customers and developing a good relationship with them. Travis also gave us his personal cell phone number in case we have any questions or problems. I would recommend any and all of my friends and associates to come see him. ",4.8
224,05-Jul-14,"I was very pleased with the overall experience at Northwest Dodge.  The sales person, Maggie Prokos, was very professional and helpful and explained the process that we would follow to purchase the new Jeep.  We used one of the on-line buying service which made the process smooth and hassle free and the dealership lived up to its commitment.  Ms. Prokos was professional and friendly during the entire purchase. Mr. Jones and Ms. Glenewinkel were also very professional and helpful.  Overall a very good experience on a new vehicle purchase.",5

219,12-Jul-14,"W e had an outstanding experience purchasing a 2014 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited Sahara. This vehicle was going to be a birthday present for our daughter and we shopped around just casually for about a month. My wife and I are very busy and met Markeith Lewis at Northwest Dodge and he made the whole buying experience less stressful. We waited and he kept searching for the exact one we wanted and could afford. He stayed in contact with my wife on what was coming in and to come take a look. I was out of town at the time and made it in a few days later and the rest is history. Very professional, trustworthy individual I felt very comfortable working with and no pressure or stress.",5
217,22-Jul-14,"Now if I did not put 5 stars it was solely because of the other sales people I dealt with before my sales person. I actually went to this dealership twice, first time I left unhappy due to rude and pushy sales. The second time we went in to try again except with Markeith, oh boy are we glad we did. He is such a great sales person!!! He actually listens and understands where you are coming from. Not only does he listen, he tries to work with you. So long story short.. I got my Grand Cherokee! I totally recommend Markeith!",4.6
218,22-Jul-14,"Honestly, I went into the dealership with little hope, for its been my experience that I when its to good to be true, it isn't!  I went in looking for a particular SUV and came out with ""my"" truck.  Lincoln was awesome, he come out greeted me, made our contact personal, and he gave me a new leash in life.  I could not had asked for a greater deal.  Then again, after seeing the news on how The Dodge Cooperation helped out a fellow Marine, I was extremely proud I made this decision and met the personnel at this dealership.  Maggie thank you for your assistance, good luck and God bless. This dealership has made me a true believer that there are fresh starts! I will remain a loyal customer to the dodge product.   ",5
216,28-Jul-14,"I have never been to a dealership where there wasnt a pushy sales person but here at Northwest Dodge I found just that. Markeith Lewis was helpful and patient and not pushy. I went in to look at the Journey towards the end of the evening and decided to buy. It was past time for Markeith to leave and he didnt once act like I was an inconvenience. He made sure my car was detailed for me to take home. The finance guy and the customer service lady were very patient and courteous as well. I upgraded to leather seats and took my vehicle back a few days later for them to tend to that for me. I was given a loaner car until I got my vehicle back. I was so pleased with the service there that I took my mother in law back to see Markeith a week after I bought my vehicle and he was just as patient with her. And when she bought her car and the next day wasnt happy she was told to bring it back and they would work with her until she was happy. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a new Dodge, Jeep or Chrysler.",5
215,30-Jul-14,"Went in f or service on a Wed. And left with a truck Friday. Service dep.. Nothing to write home about, but sales and finance depth. Exceptional. Markeith was awesome gave me his card on wed. And I gave him a call that Friday. We met up and to my surprise the trucks I was looking at on their website was actually in stock. After testing driving the vehicles we closed the deal. Next was finance, we all know how that goes, but Billy was great as well. Except for a little hiccup at the my experience was great. Kudos guys, keep up the great work, us (the customer), need more guys like you in car sales.",4.2
214,03-Aug-14,"My husband and I recently purchased a 2014 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  It had been 14 years since we had purchased a new vehicle and we (especially me) were really shocked at how the car buying process has changed not to mention how much prices have increased.   Our sales associate was Travis Hance.  He greeted us as we pulled in to park.  He was very knowledgeable about all the current and past Dodge, Chrysler and Jeep products as well as a lot of other vehicles.  We were very impressed with his knowledge and all his help in getting us a vehicle that we are comfortable with.  Travis was always smiling and eager to answer any and all questions.  He was never pushy or over anxious just to get a sale.  He made us feel more like friends than just customers.  All of this means a lot not just to us but to all customers.  They are more likely to remember a good and pleasant car buying experience and return to that dealership.  Thanks,  Mary & Pete",4.3

209,12-Aug-14,"I'm not afraid to say that I shopped around a lot before settling on a Challenger at this dealership. From the start Markeith, the internet salesman, was very outgoing and honest. He and Moises definitely went above and beyond to make this purchase smooth and as painles as possible. As a first time buyer I can say that any anxiety I had quickly disappeared seeing how much these guys worked on getting me a great deal on a car I had always wanted. Two thumbs up, five stars, 10/10, yada yada yada this place is fantastic.",5

204,01-Oct-14,"I made an appointment to take my Chrysler 300 in for a timing chain recall, airbag light ""on"" and tapping noise in the engine.  I told them to rotate the tires, change the oil and do a state inspection while the car was in.  Long-story-short, two weeks later they had only done the inspection on the car and were not going to even start working on my car until the next week.   Why did they even take my car if they weren't going to work on it for weeks?  They have a sign in their show room that states among other things, ""I will be very sensitive of my customers time.""  This is simply not the case.  My car rental during the first week was $620.  They took care of the second week.  I picked-up the car at the start of the third week having only the state inspection done.  I'm not sure if its incompetence or just bad customer service but I could not take it any more.  Obviously they don't have their act together an I don't want idiots like this working on my car.  I highly recommend that you do not use these guys.  Total cost of this experience $660.",1

And now that its not working the service guy said it would cost about $ 1200 dollar. But my problem is we get a call saying it will be covered and 30 mins later we get a call saying its not. Because who every checked the truck never recorded on the computer. they have no record of show that they even checked A/C or anything else. That's not the way you do business people.

200,07-Nov-14,"I took my daughters rental car back to pick up her vehicle that the service dept had for three weeks. We pulled into the service area, unlike Ford or Toyota no one greeted us. We got out of the rental car and had to take two baby seats out. Since I was not accustomed to doing it; then it became somewhat cumbersome. Fifteen minutes later we got both out and yet no one had acknowledged our presence. My son goes into the temporary building and four of their employees were there and no one said anything. I went inside and we stood in front of a desk where an employee was on the computer. Three of the four walk out; the one in front of us never said anything. I guess I am use to someone saying ""I will be with you in a minute"". Another employee comes in from the back door and I asked if anyone was working today. He asked if I had a car to return, we said ""yes"" and he said we need to go see the cashier. No signs were displayed, but he directed us to the main building. Walked up to the cashier, who doesn't greet you,...you have to just tell her you are there to pick up a car and which one. ""Sign here, go stand out there"". Where is there? We go back to the service building, pick up the two car seats for the kids and walk to where we thought ""there"" was. Five minutes goes by then ten, really, all they are doing is pulling up your vehicle. Go back inside and ask the cashier if we were in the right place. ""Just go out front"". Did as I was told and finally our vehicle pulls up. Guy gets out, we load the car seats by ourselves and he walks off. There was no ""thanks for coming in"" or  any type of gracious gesture on his part. Really...this dealership should change the name of ""Service Dept"" to something else because they all need to go to ""charm"" school and find out that we don't have to buy a car from them. Thank goodness my Ford Dealership doesn't treat us this way. How in the world do they stay in business???",1
199,28-Nov-14,"I've bring my Jeep for a warranty service since the cylinder head needs to be replaced three times. I brought the car and have told the service advisor what the problem was the first time that i brought the car there and they just reset the computer and the check engine light came on again next day that i took the car. Then i brought the car there the second time and they have said that i was right and now they need to order the part. Now the part arrived and the car is still there and its not ready yet. The problem becomes when they ""schedule"" an appointment and i bring the car and they do not touch it for 4 days. The second time they schedule the appointment again and they didn't touch the car for three days. Now, the third time, the car has been there since monday and they just told me that they have not touch the car and they will not be able to finish before next tuesday. I do not understand why the dealer schedule the appointment and then they do not touch the car for several days. Even when is a manufacturer defect, the dealer didn't gave me any car rental. Ive bought a car at this dealer 10 years ago and it was great, with this service ill never go back to that dealer and will make a huge campaign against them for this crappy service.",1.4
198,06-Dec-14,"I brought my vehicle 2013 Dodge Charger in to NW Dodge the on Friday October 3rd for the following service repairs 
1.	Rear main seal leak
2.	Vehicle hesitation when accelerating from low speeds (red lightning bolt on dash) 
3.	Seat clicking when stopping and starting
On or around October 6th I received a call from Michelle letting me know the vehicle was ready the only item they fixed was the rear main seal and replaced the oil pan gasket they did not notice any other issues, at that time I took an advisor and a mechanic for a test drive and showed them the hesitations I was experiencing and the clicking sound in the driver’s seat.
On around the 26th I called after hearing from anyone to find out how much longer it would take to complete the repairs they said it was finished and ready to pick up ( no one called me) when I arrived they said they found no issues with the seat track and they had resolved the hesitation I was feeling by changing   plugs and putting in an air filter I then requested the service manager go on a test drive with me I showed him the issues that I originally brought it in for during the test drive he confirmed the repairs they made would not in fact fix the issues I was experiencing and that  it was the transmission acting up so we went back to the dealership and he took it back in for repairs.  
I spoke to the GM at that point showed him my car explained at 48K I should not be experiencing so many issues and inquired about trading it in Patrick was completing the repairs at this point I left the vehicle with him I was already in a loaner and they now knew for sure what the issues were.
On around the 17th of November I called Michelle inquiring about the status with my car she said she had no idea and that she thought I picked it up she said she would look into it… after not hearing from her the next morning I called North West Dodge and spoke to a lady named Barbara at any rate no one knew where my car was so I went directly to the dealership… It turned out that Patrick had the vehicle however no repairs were ever made he then asked if we could go on a test drive with his mechanic they got a laptop and brought the car up front…  the hesitations were not as noticeable as they were before they then decided to chance the throttle housing and TPS we switched drivers and the mechanic drove the car at that time I checked the on board computer and saw the vehicle had been driven 145MPH both Patrick and the mechanic were in the car with me they both knew I was extremely upset by my actions at that point the interior of my car in the front seat  was dirty the cup holders had pennies and soda in them the seat belt on the passenger’s side was sticky from a spill the chrome on the center console had scratches on it he even put his computer there when we changed drivers even key 1 seat was reprogramed to adjust to someone else they had been driving my car everything was readjusted I brought it in with almost 48K the gas had been used I had this car clean inside and out the only marks on it were on the driver’s side bumper where I had a sheet of rubber hit it on the highway. When the mechanic parked it in the new service bay I noticed a scratch on the passenger door all the way to the metal and two gray marks one on the passenger’s side of the hood and bumper when I brought it in we walked around the car and took notes that stuff was not there when I brought the car in I talked to Ken Baker he said he would wait till it is done then we will show a GM Ken knows how well I care for my car and he saw it when I brought it in. As of December 3rd no one has called me to give me any type of a update I called Michelle twice yesterday both times left a message she has yet to respond.

Ken Baker is a great sales person he is honest and caring he is the only reason I have bought so many cars from them but until they get the right people in the service department this dealership will not grow to its full potential.

I love the fact that Oscar Tores(my salesman) showed me exactly what I wanted to see and asked me if I wanted to look at anything else instead of trying to walk me through the entire inventory. I felt very respected and enjoyed my time there. He kept me informed of everything and told me what all my options were. I walked out that day with a car and have been loving it since.

192,06-Feb-15,"It is supposed to be a pleasure to have a new car, but my experience with Northwest Dodge was HORRIBLE and DISSAPONTING. They promised me great quality and what I received was CRAPT, with extra costs, the only thing they wanted was to sell me the car and did not show any customer service. When I came back to pick up my new car with the new features that I wanted installed (Sun roof and DVD player) I saw what they did with my car it was complete crapt. They literally got those DVD players and tied it on my headrests that looks absolutely HORRIBLE and was not what they offered me and NOT what I PAID for at the beginning. What they did was EXTREMLEY cheap and BAD QUALITY. 
After I saw this I went to talk to Roberto Rendino (Manager of Sales), the attention to me was horrible he did not offer me to sit and resolve the issue I was just standing there discussing. ALL he cared about is trying to convince me that what they sold me was what I paid for and that it was a miscommunication between the sales guy and I.  I am beyond ANGRY, I don’t recommend this location to NO ONE there customer service is horrible. I will NEVER return there again. I got ripped off and received LIES from these employees.

Robert stated it sould be a couple of days before they would be able to look at it and determin what the issue was. On 01/30/2015 Robert Longoria called me and stated the turbo needed to be replaced, oxygen sensors and the catalytic converter, they gave a quote for the the catalytic converter and the oxygen sensor for 2200-4400 On 02/04/2015 Robert called stated the turbo was covered under the extended warrinty i purchased, and they were waiting for the MPP ( mechanical protection plan) inspector to go and inspect the truck,. I spoke to the inspector and he verified that only the turbo was covered under the extended warranty i asked him if i would be able to get the other 2 things done some where else because the charge with northwest dodge was too high for me and he said yes. I got a call from robert again and he stated that if i did not get the other issues fixed with them the turbos warrinty would be voided.( this was not true since i had already spoken to the inspector myself). I told Robert that i only wanted to have the turbo done since it was the only thing that the insurance covered. I called rober on 02/09/2014 since i had not heard from him he stated that the truck also needed an oil change and the crank case filter i asked him about the cost and he quoted me $360.00. On 02/11/15 I called robert and asked about the status of the vehicle he stated that it would be ready the next day he asked again about the oil and the crank case filter he said the truck had no oil at that point i agreed to have the oil change and the crank case filter changed. on 02/12/2014 Robert called stated that the truck was ready, went that evening to pick up the truck and on the ride home it was making a horrible noise, once home my father and i checked out the truck and noticed that the pipe from the exhaust the one that meet the catalytic convered was cut opened completely and never got reattached. I was unable to contact the dealer since they where closed for the day. On 02/13/15 drove the truck back to the service department and spoke the service manager,he then inspected the truck spoke with the service guy and came back and told me he could not fix it. that he had to replace it and he could not replace it for free and it would be 4400 dollars to do it. I dont understand why they cant fix something they did, that cut on the pipe was not their when the truck was brought in and now they cant fix it, i have lost time , hours at work and money only so they can tell me they cant fix something that they are responsible for.

184,16-Feb-15,"I have to admit I came in expecting a typical experience. After meeting Travis Hance at Traders Village last weekend I was pleasantly surprised to find a stress free environment.

Travis took some extra time to explain different trim levels and features, and we picked out the perfect Jeep. He even helped us get signed up for Houston Jeep People events!

Thanks to Northwest and Travis we had a great experience!",5
185,16-Feb-15,I've never had a car dealership guy listen to my wants and needs thanks for your help Jason dunaway.I will definitely be back.thank you ,4.8
186,16-Feb-15,"Thank you to everyone at Northwest - I am the proud new owner of a Jeep. I am a Jeeper gal! Travis was awesome and answered all my questions - he even got me a loaner while my running boards were being installed!

Thanks guys! Thanks Travis!!! (He even gave me a pen)",4.8
183,17-Feb-15,"If your looking to buy a vehicle, I would definitely recommend you go here!!!! When you call and make an appointment or go up there, ask for Maggie!! She was very helpful and pleasant! She was able to get us everything we asked for!!! ",5
182,19-Feb-15,"When you go ask for Mike Cruse! He gave us the best experience we could've ever asked for. We had walked onto this lot expecting to see a few vehicles and to be able to find what we wanted based on what we knew. We found out differently. We got out & not too quickly, but Mike could tell we had questions. He came over, was more than friendly and actually cared about how we felt about this buying car situation and was wanting to answer any of the questions we had. He spent 3 days with us because we wanted that time to find THE perfect vehicle, and he was able to provide every needy detail that I had in mind. He helped my husband and me come to a mutual vehicle by helping us see both sides. 2 different people with 2 entirely different desires for a car. Mike KNEW his stuff and he KNEW his car information and he WANTED to provide us with the best deal on a car for what WE wanted, NOT what he wanted to sell us. He bent over backwards in order to help us find the perfect car, just for our family. We are young and he didn't give up on us even when he could've easily walked away. He didn't give up on our dream. He searched high & low for OUR vehicle. Go to Northwest Chrysler Jeep Dodge Ram and ask for Mike Cruse and he will give you the best bang for your buck (best car for your dollar) that you are happy about. I will definitely recommend Mike to all of my friends, and will be going back to see Mike when we replace our next vehicle. ",5
181,21-Feb-15,"Travis helped me pick out the perfect Wrangler after we met at Trader's Village. He was patient when I asked for the addition of running boards. He then made a phone call and had them installed before the end of the day. Unbelievable!

When he asked if I would write reviews for him online I was more than happy to recommend Northwest. Travis even called the next day to make sure everything was going ok.

Thanks guys for changing my mind about dealerships!",5

175,06-Apr-15,"No one in the service department knows what they are doing. HORRIBLE customer service. I DO NOT RECOMMEND this dealership/shop! Bought my 2014 Journey in April 2014. In May 2014. transmission started slipping. Due to the inconvenience of loaner cars, they could not get my vehicle in the shop until November 2014. Since November 2014, my car has been in the shop 4 times for a total of 3 months. Each time they said it was ready, I would pick it up and have it right back in for not being fixed. Service Advisor's NEVER called with an update. I would have to track them down only to hear ""I haven't heard anything yet"" This last time my car was ""ready"" I was told 3 days later to pick it up. I got in my car and not even out of the parking lot and figured IT STILL WAS NOT FIXED! I had to leave it for a 4th time. Apparently, the service tech's do not know what they are doing after having my car 3 months! I hope to never have to deal with this shop again and will not buy from them again.",1

Maggie got right to work, was informative, honest and very friendly.  She helped up find the vehicles we needed and got us the deal we were looking for.  We then went to finance and our finance guy (sorry I forgot his name, but he was a young UT graduate) was wonderful!  They both stayed there very late to help us wrap it up in one night and were smiling and pleasant the entire time!  We are more than happy with our experience and the next time we're in the market for a new car or truck we'll be back!",5

So naturally I checked back with them to make sure I should come in Saturday to test drive as it appeared the car had been sold.  I was advised the car was definitely still available even after I mentioned it appeared sold.  So after driving for an hour and sitting there while the car was being looked for 30 minutes, of course it had been sold - the day before.

Not a fun experience, I only wanted to test drive that one car and was not interested in going to look at what else was there.....Pass on this place going forward.",2

169,21-May-15,"We purchased a truck in February and paid with a cashiers check. Strike #1: take in the check and give it to the finance guy expecting to sign a receipt but when this is brought up he gives a snide comment about wanting a picture handing him the check. Strike #2: 2 months later there are still no plates and tags after repeated calls and speaking with multiple people. Finally speak to someone in finance for the 3rd time and she states that accounting lost the check we gave them. Speak to the GM who promises this will be taken care of ""This week"" (LIAR!!) It is now 3 months from the time we purchased the vehicle and we finally find out that they need us to go to our bank to get another check issued and that they will not be giving us our plates and title until the sale is closed. (It's not closed because they have incompetent people working for them to LOST the check and now it is our responsibility to get them a new one. Strike #3: go to the bank to get this resolved (NW Dodge refused to send a representative with us to fill out any forms) The bank needs to fax a form for NW Dodge to fill out and the person the bank speaks to on the phone says they don't have a fax machine. This dealership will not do anything to help the customer other than relieve you of $$ but only if you are financing a vehicle. ",1.4

167,30-May-15," I found my own bank to extend a loan for my business vehicle. I then went to northwest dodge so that I could make the purchase through them I told them who would approve the loan . After they did all the paper work they told me I needed 4500 down with my trade in . I called 2 weeks later and asked was the deal still good . The dealer checked and said yeah your good to go he then took $1000 deposit. Upon getting there ""45min drive"" I was told that they were able to get me approved ""duh I knew that "" ,but I needed an additional 2 grand :so I declined the deal and asked for a prompt  refund well a week in a half  later still nothing I've called several times to speak with a manager and I'm still waiting.........???? this is just a inconvenience  ",1.8
166,04-Jun-15,"From jump I was lied too.  I started the process online due to my time constraints. When I went to the dealership I was greeted by a used car salesman who appeared to be trustworthy and honest.  I test drove the vehicle and found no problems with it so I began process to purchase it.   I was contacted by the salesman who told me I was approved at a high interest rate due to my credit.  He told me to come back in after work so we could complete the paperwork.  I was told the car had a front end alignment and brand new tires and was a courtesy for new buyers. When speaking with the finance manager, I noticed there was an extra charge of roughly $2900.00 on my paperwork, when I enquired about it, I was told I couldn't get financing without purchasing the gap insurance and extended warranty.  At that time I told them I wanted to seek financing on my own as I knew it was unlawful to force me to purchase their service agreement and gap insurance.  This was on a Friday, so I was allowed to take the car home for the weekend. While driving home, I noticed a loud knocking coming from the back of the vehicle when I hit a bump, because the dealership was closed I chose to park the car at my home for the weekend and contact the salesman to let him know of the noise.  On that Monday when I went in to sign the agreement, I informed the salesman of the noise, he claims he heard it when I test drove it, and he would have it repaired for me, I just had to make an appointment with his service center.   In the meantime I started the process of signing paperwork and the service warranty and gap insurance was still on it.  I refused to sign when the finance manager said he would speak with his manager to see about removing it.  When he came back he said he couldn't remove it completley as American Credit Acceptance was requiring it.  I informed him at that time that I knew it was unlawful however I had already put a down payment on the car and didn't want to lose that.  When I took possession of the vehicle, I immediatley filed a complaint with the TX Department of Motor Vehicles against Northwest Dodge and American Credit Acceptance.  During the investigation it was determined that Nortwest Dodge misrepresented ACA and they never told them I had to purchase the agreement.  Northwest Dodge had to refund the service contract in the amount of $2601.50  to ACA which was applied to my principal balance.  During that time I also scheduled an appointment for the service center to repair the knocking in the rear drivers side of the vehicle.  I dropped my car off and within an hour was called to come pick it up.  I was told the vehicle was repaired, however when I drove off the noise was worse.  I immediatley turned back around and took it back to the service center.  The service manager took the car back to the shop and later came  and said it was the rear strut and she wasn't authorized to repair it.  I told her that the salesman told me it would be repaired free of charge she said without his authorization she couldn't do it.  I immediately contacted the salesman who informed me that he was off and would contact me the following morning to have it repaired.  I have yet to hear from him.  Fast forward March 2015.  My vehicle isn't road safe because the right front control arm was damaged beyond repair and had to be replaced.  The mechanic explained the vehicle had this major damage before I purchased it and there was no possible way the vehicle had a front end alignment with that type of damage so the salesman lied to me.  Furthermore, that vehicle should not have even been sold as it was a danger to myself and other motorist so he could not let me drive away knowing the control arm was one pot hole away from breaking.  I authorized the repairs and immediately filed another complaint with the DMV.  I am so disappointed that this ""reputable"" dealership treat customers this way.  I am disturbed that they lied to me not once but twice just to make a sale and put myself and other drivers in harms way.  The sad part is, there is only one employee in that entire company who has shown an ounce of integrity and I wonder if that was due to the complaints lodged against them.  I tell anyone who is looking to purchase a car to steer clear away from Northwest Dodge.   If word of mouth can build a business, it can harm one as well.  I got the last laugh though.  Since then I have purchased two more vehicles at another dealership.  Just think, had they been honest, I would have purchased both from them as a happy returning customer.",1.6
165,22-Jun-15,"We bought our Acura MDX 2007 from them almost 3 weeks ago. We saw this vehicle listed in their website and pretty impressed with it because it mentioned that it had the entertainment package with 6 CD disc changer, navigation package, sunroof/moon roof, leather seat and a clean title. By the time we got there it was already late, however we took time to inspect the mechanical part of the vehicle pretty well. Since the vehicle had the entertainment package with the navigation system, it had a lot of functionalities and buttons associated with it, so we did not have time to check each and every button. It was partly our mistake that we relied on the ad and did not check everything in the entertainment system or I can say it was our bad luck that we did not carry any cds to inspect the cd player. 

After purchase when we arrived home we wanted to go for a nice drive so we grabbed some CDs and DVDs. That’s when we realized that our 6 disc CD player that they put on the ad doesn’t work. We called them the next day which was Friday and explained the situation to the sales associate “Micha” who sold us the vehicle. He told us to bring the car on Monday (since Saturday and Sunday was his busy day) so he can have a look at it. Monday when we were ready to take the car to the dealership, our car did not start. After we got the jump start and took it to multiple places to diagnose we found out that the alternator was bad. After unsuccessful multiple attempts to get hold of the sales agent we called the dealership directly and found out that the sales agent was working that day so we just showed up at the dealership and explained the situation to the sales agent. He asked the service team to have a look at the vehicle. The service team only looked at the CD player and said they can’t fix it. In order to fix they have to take apart the player and send it somewhere or to get the sub contractor to work on it. The service team called Micha to ask how to approach the problem, he said he will talk to his manager and get back to us. When we mentioned to the lady at the service team that it’s a false hope to get a call from Micha, she assured that if he doesn’t call, she will call us first thing in the morning. Since that day nobody has called us. I have called Micha multiple times and left him messages. Once I was able to get hold of him and he said he thought the lady from service team already called us. He said he will find the update and call us back after talking to her. Off course I never heard from him again after all his promise to call me back. I had also left multiple messages to the lady at the service department and never got a call from her either.

The dealership claims that the vehicle goes through 75 point inspection. My question is what’s the point of us buying from them versus buying from a small dealer, if the dealership is not going to do anything in the time the vehicle doesn’t have features and reliability as they put up in their ads. Now we have to spend a lot more for this vehicle than we ever expected for. We thing that it is deceptive business practice to sell something that you claim but you don’t have.

163,09-Jul-15,"The absolute worst overall customer service and service department I have ever experienced.  I would be embarrassed if my paycheck came from there and I provided such lackluster and horrible service on a daily basis.  You fix cars, you check in vehicles for service, you paint stuff:  its not rocket science.  My one day repair turned into 4 and I had to check the work and send it back because it looked like an 8 year old did it.  Every person I dealt with had 'sloped shoulders' and would not take responsibility for anything.  It was always somebody else's fault or some other departments issue.  In the end, I ended up with a fixed truck, a head ache, a few hours missed at work, and a door ding that they could not have cared less about.

I've been a Dodge truck guy for a long time  and the experience I had at NW Dodge will likely make me rethink my next brand purchase.

One thing is for sure, I will go to Tomball or Katy if I EVER need any warranty work done in the future.  A good friend who has been in the car business his whole life warned me about their service department but I ignored him.  My mistake...I should have listened.

Bottom line, do yourself a favor and stay away from this xxxx hole of a service department.",1

159,25-Jul-15,"I was there interested in buying a 2010 Challenger RT, cash!! I told the sales women, France's, I was just there to look and I wasn't ready to buy that day. Frances gave me a price of $21,876 drive out. This car had original bad tires (53,000 miles), bad breaks, the steering wheel trembled, the a/c   needed Freon, so as any other customer I tried to negotiate for a lower price. I was told that was the lowest price. I decided to leave and think about.  The next day I went back to look at the car again at 6:30 am. I was waiting for Francis but around 9am, I approached Ken Baker, fleet manager. I expressed my interest to him and asked him if he could help me get a lower price, I told him of all the defects I found in the car. He went to check and came back with a higher price than what Francis gave me. He said it would be $1142 more because they would have to fix it and would then sell it for a higher price. I asked that they not fix anything and sell it to me at $21,876. Frances arrived and asked me if I was going for buy it at the price Ken gave me. I told them I wanted it for the first price Frances gave me $21876. They said no, so I left. The next day I called and asked Frances to see if the car had been fixed and what the new price was. She said the car had been washed and tires had been replaced, she didn't know the price so she was going to check and call me back. She never called, so I decided to go in person. She was hanging out at the front desk when I got there. I asked why she hadn't called me and she said she was in a meeting . All I wanted to know was the new price. I asked her to check the price so she went to Rick Lester who came back with an even higher price $22571+TTL....Every time I asked for the price , they would raise it. I asked for what had been done to the car, he said it didn't matter and the price he was giving me was the final price. I asked if all the things I mentioned had been fixed, he said NO, we don't do that, we just sent it for an inspection. He seemed frustrated and told me again that, that was the final price. He told me the car was being washed at the moment and was going to be sent to the auction...He said said ""You know what, I rather send the car to the auction than sell it to you!!""...I was completely shocked and disappointed at the dishonesty and disrespectful. He opened the door for me as a signal for me to leAve his dealership. I felt really upset and disappointed. I waisted so much time driving all the way from Clear Lake for this type of treatment. When I got home, I was looking online, and this same exact car is posted for $20991....A lower price than I was initially given and was willing to pay. This place is a joke and belittles  customers!!! I have left a message for Jeff Sebastian to call me and hope to hear from him so I can tell him personally of my horrible experience.

158,07-Aug-15,"I would not do business with this dealership because you cannot get anyone in Service to call you back or answer the phone. I have called multiple times, trying to get warranty performed on my truck and either no one answers the phone, or I get a promise for someone to call me back who never does. I figure someone is a very busy person as I never get a name or direct number. The times I have had my truck in for repair, I have always had to leave it overnight as the appointment time does not seem to mean anything. I was told the appointment is just to see the advisor, not to schedule repair. Because  service dictates who I buy from, I will not be buying any vehicles from this dealership.  I will say the advisors have been friendly when I went there. ",2

156,14-Aug-15,"Worst experience ever! I am from Austin. I had made my deal online with the internet sales manager, Michael Cruse. We had already agreed upon price, terms and my wife provided everything he needed to have the paperwork ready to go as well as making sure the preowned vehicle we were purchasing was added to our insurance policy.We were also trading in a vehicle and my wife had filled out the preinspection estimate and received a certificate for full market value. We also provided all of the original paperwork with the car, recent repair ticket to demonstrate $1800 in recent replacement parts. Mr. Cruse assured us he had received everything and the vehicle ""was ready to go."" We explained to him the urgency of everything being prepared. THIS WAS ANYTHING BUT A NO HAGGLE/NO HASSLE EXPERIENCE!!!  We knew Mr. Cruse would not be there the next day but he assured us his friend, Jeff Taylor, would take care of us and again reassured us everything would be ready to ""sign"" and ""drive."" Not only was Mr. Cruse not there, his ""friend - Jeff Taylor"" was not there and so we were passed along yet again to another sales person, Dax Edwards. This is where all of the real problems began. Not only was the vehicle not clean as we were promised, it needed an oil change, a brake job and was still being inspected and serviced, which we were quoted would take 2 to 3 hours and none of the paperwork was ready. He said they did not have our finance application and all but called my wife a liar. He was RUDE, ARROGANT, DEFENSIVE AND CONDESCENDING. On top of all of that, I went to inspect the vehicle back in the shop and IT IS DAMAGED!!! THERE ARE DENTS AND DINGS AND SCRAPES ALL OVER THIS VEHICLE, none of which are clearly portrayed in the pictures displayed online, nor verbally told to us when we inquired as to the condition of the vehicle. When we arrived at our appointed time, we discovered all of this and began the ""waiting game"" this dealership likes to play with all of its customers. We received excuse after excuse of why the vehicle was not ready. Here is the best part! Dax was trying to sell us the vehicle at a higher price!! We had already negotiated our deal the day prior and they tried to go up on the price after we drove 160 miles one way on a weekday! All Houstonians need to be aware of the lies, deceit and trickery this dealership plays. They do not care about your valuable time and will misrepresent the facts to you and give you excuse after excuse. We were willing to give them an opportunity to get things straight, so we left for lunch and asked them to call us. Two and a half hours later after no reply and me sending emails, texts, I finally called and asked were we going to be able to get the deal done and he told me at that point it would take 2 hours to get the brakes done and one a half hours to -- get this, sign the paperwork. SIMPLY RIDICULOUS AND ABSURD BEYOND BELIEF! DON'T WASTE YOUR PRECIOUS FAMILY'S TIME BY GIVING THIS DEALERSHIP ANY OF YOUR HARD-EARNED MONEY. I sent the sales manager emails and texts while all of this was going on while we waited in Houston for over 4 hours to get this resolved, and never had the courtesy of a reply. When I returned to Austin, I sent another email to the sales manager and still have not had the courtesy of a return phone call or apology for wasting 9.5 hours of my time while I drove 320 miles round trip, missed a complete whole day of work doing so, and waited 4 hours for a reply or return call/text/email. They obviously don't need any more business, they are too busy to take care of new customers. Quoted from my text with Michael Cruse:  ""Very good. I have the entire deal ready to go. The 4Runner is ready. My buddy Jeff Taylor will get you wrapped up."" This is the promise we had received and so we headed to Houston to purchase the vehicle.  Thanks, Northwest Chrylser Jeep and Dodge from Vaughn and Michelle Shelton. I think I'll send this to Jimmy Fallon of The Tonight Show to include on his ""Thank You Notes"" segment.",1

I was told A)  my new car took synthetic oil (which I was never advised) B)  They had not ran the $100 special in months & C)  I could pay for just the one oil change that would $80.  So for $65, they flushed a 10 year relationship down the drain.  Note:  I provided the make, model, ect when I made the appointment.  Be careful with this dealership and shop around.",2.6
150,07-Oct-15,"Won't honor its own advertising. Sends out a promotional offer and refuses to honor it even though all term were met. Adds thousands of dollars to vehicle price for unnecessary paint sealers, upholstry treatment, window etching, dealer prep. Have to fight to get these taken off price but not sure they were because of confusing finance forms.  Can't get straight answers from anyone.  Horrible dealer, stay away!!",1.6
149,13-Oct-15,As a customer of Crystal I was very well pleased with her personal commitment of our family purchase of the 2015 Nissan Altima to prepare her for college.  Currently owning BMW/Landrover products this vehicle Crystal sold us is comfortable and she was not pushy at all so that totally gained my trust an purchase.  Hope she continue performing that way an When I'm in the market again you guys will be my 1st stop.,5
148,10-Nov-15,"Everyone ws very polite, helpful, and friendly. They moved quickly and fully explained everything. Everyone was great. I loved my experience and would recommend people to go there as well.",5
147,28-Nov-15,"I was not expecting to buy a truck today but I did. This is the third vehicle we have bought from Northwest Dodge and we will continue to go back. From the front door to the final handshake, everyone was amazing. ",5
146,02-Dec-15,only stopped to look.. The sales staff was very friendly and did not use pressure. A great deal was made on a new ram and trade in was more than fair. Very pleased and highly recommend this dealership ,5
145,07-Dec-15,"Maggie Prokos (sales) and Shawn Cranford (finance) were absolutely incredible.  Maggie knew/knows her products and inventory, understands and respects the customer's time and my impatience, and most importantly makes you feel like you're part of the family.  Shawn, well with this guy I have to say this was the most painless part of a car-buying experience I've ever encountered.  Usually you wind up in a finance person's office at the end of a brutal sale only to be confronted with a pushy after-the-sale finance person pushing warranties, among other things on you.  Shawn was super nice, quick to the point of the products, explained them very well, and was in no way pushy about the experience.  That made me very happy and was without a doubt the sole catalyst in me spending another $2500 on an extended warranty.

All in all I have to say car-buying in the past has always been one of those ""I would rather be pulling teeth"" experiences for my wife and I.  I walked into the Northwest dealership on Friday at 1:45PM and was out the door by 4:00PM with exactly what I wanted for a trade amount and a new vehicle (2016 300S).  My experience (and the deal too) was so good in fact, the wife and I returned on Saturday morning and drove off with another new vehicle (Dodge Journey Crossroads) for her.  Wonderful experience and I would highly recommend this dealership and it's staff to anyone looking for new Dodge, Chrysler, Jeep, or used vehicles.  Prior to this experience, I would have never given any car dealership I've dealt with any more than a C+ rating.  This however gets a full A++++ rating from the wife and I both.

Maggie, Micah, Shawn, Bob, and many others that simply walked by and talked to us with a smile (and in one case a good joke) - I simply say THANK YOU!",5
144,19-Dec-15,"Had a bad clutch and wasn't optimistic that the dealer would accept a trade in, but I was wrong. Sylvester was a great help and I appreciate all that NW Dodge has done for me.",5

142,01-Jan-16,I recieved great service at this dealership. I went on what seemed to be one of the busiest days 12/31 New Years and still recieved fantastic service. Max Dao helped me and he was very personable and tentative. Thank You Max,5

139,18-Jan-16,"I called to ask questions about a 2014 RAM 1500 posted online. I had specific questions regarding the after market wheels, tires and lift on the truck. I originally spoke to Kayla, who could not answer those questions but assured me she would have someone from the used car department contact me with those answers. An hour and a half later, a gentlemen from whom I can't remember his name called me back. He preceded with all the quizzing questions of what I was looking for, how long I'd been looking, when I'm buying, so forth, so I cut to the chase and told him why I originally call and what I wanted to know about the specific truck. He put me on hold to come back and tell me ""yes"" the truck is here, when will I expect you? I again told him what I wanted to know and when he had those answers to call me back because this call was wasting my time! He then got really loud saying ""you didn't talk to me, you didn't talk to me."" I said no, I talked to Kayla and gave her the specific questions I wanted to know. He again said ""but you didn't talk to me!"" At that point I asked to talk to Kayla and he hung up on me. Guess the sell isn't that important to them, so I'll move on down the road...",1

I couldn't recommend this dealership enough to anyone looking for a new or used car! ",4.8

133,08-Feb-16,They have had my car for over a week and it is nowhere near complete. All I brought it in for is a fog light and squeak noise from exhaust. Took 4 days for me to get a loaner. From the looks of it my car is going to be there another week. Called the service manager but he has not called me back. ,2
132,15-Feb-16,"Although I can assume that all or most of the Northwest Dodge employees are as thoughtful, diligent and dedicated to their profession as was Mr. Kristek, I credit his work and efforts for the great purchase I was able to make.  Northwest Dodge should have more sales persons like Mr. Kristek.  The key to my appreciation of Ed's value to Northwest Dodge is NOT just what he did for me before the sale (helping to find the right truck, putting me with the right sales persons, informing me on the various qualities of my truck, etc), but what he did AFTER I had made my purchase.  Ed continued to help me with minor repairs to the truck, finding me with after market vendors for spraying my bed liner, and also giving me ideas about how to maintain and protect my truck to ensure it will last and give me the best value.  Mr. Kristek is a very hard working and honest sales person, and based on the negative experiences I had in looking for a truck before I arrived at NW Dodge, that is a rare combination.  Thanks again, Ed.  I will be back.",4.8

129,24-Apr-16,We had a great experience at Northwest Dodge. Bob is a great guy. Not a typical salesman. He is not pushy and genuinely wants to help. We went there twice. The first time helped us and spent all day trying to get us taken care of. We just couldn't buy at that time. He followed up regardless. Then are car got flooded in the cypress area and we had no choice. He remembered are needs and wants 3 months later and was able to get us where we needed to be. I finally got the Challenger of my dreams. Thanks Bob Williams at Northwest Dodge!,5

No matter if you have an appointment or you just put your vehicle in line at 6am and wait for them to open at 7am (so you be the first one)  they still going to take at least 2 hours to change your oil and on top of that they always have this sad unhappy bossy face they talk to you like you're asking them money not a customer who is there to spend money and expect a good service anyways I purchased one of their service packages which includes 3 oil changes 3 tire rotation and 3 car wash but this is the second time I take my truck there and have to wait for more than 2 hours to find that they didn't wash the truck or rotate the tires because as they claim the tires don't need to be rotate and they don't have enough time to wash the truck finally today when I asked them about the report the receipt that shows what service they performed on my truck and to provide the remaining balance of my service package they said the printer is not working and the cashier has already left

Completely disgusted. Not one apology, not one call from a lead manager. Just told to top off my oil ever gas fill up to fix my problem.",1
118,23-Jun-16,"First let me say that I have bought 3 vehicles from North West Doge in the past and have been up to this point delighted with the service, that all changed this week .
My story 
I searched the Internet for a trade in price on my car , because It is a high dollar/ low volume car, an online quote was not possible.
The very next day I get a call from Richard Farenhold of North West Dodge asking if I still had the car because he had a Client that wants the exact car , he had been looking for this car for months and it was at the top of his ""need to buy"" list 
After meeting with Richard, I spend 4 hrs waiting for them to give me a quote, the alarm bells should have rang at this point , evetially I received an acceptable quote and apologies for the delay as they were waiting for  replies from other dealerships !!!!! So there was no ""Client"" that wanted to buy this exact car, it was just punted out to all the high end dealerships.
Finally we agree I would transfer the car to them on Thursday (today) 
After completing and signing all the required paperwork and the document reviewed by Grant Rhine (USAA Manager) all that's left to do is to get the exact mileage (a few miles different than Monday) 
I grab a coffee outside when Grant comes out and said that he had just been called by his ""Big boss"" and that he had been told not to buy my car and that his boss had ""cut his legs off from under him"", nothing he could do.
No explaination was offered or given .
There is a level of emotion attached to any car, I was already stressed at letting my dream car go earlier than expected, the very last thing I needed was this additional stress. 
Would I use North West Dodge again ? Resounding NO , they were in my opinion, economical with the truth from the start, being told by Richard that he had spending authority up to 15 million dollars earlier today sticks in my throat.
Anyone considering either a trade in or buying a car from North West Dodge ? In my opinion, forget it 
After speaking to another dealership and relaying this story, he said yeah I'm really sorry you had this experience, I've heard similar stories before when dealing with North West Dodge 
So it's probably not just me 
""We hear you"" is the current spin from Dodge , how about you change that North West Dodge to ""We don't care how much we mess you around,  because we are so financially strapped right now we can't afford your car"" 
That' I s just my unsubstantiated opinion. Yet they still punt out the rough and ready Viper for >$145k 

I really hope that  the Chrysler head office reads this and are suitably embarrassed, but I doubt they will be either allowed to see it or give a flying F about this discraceful event. 
To say I'm extremely angry is an understatement.",1

116,03-Jul-16,Thank you Eric for being upfront and honest!! Eric listened to me- discussed potential outcomes and delivered. Appreciate it. The only thing I recommend is for dodge to visit a discussion around an after hour shuttle. Everyone is not from Houston with family to pickup and everyone does not trust uber. Service the customer overall. Great job Eric!,5
115,05-Jul-16,The sales team worked with me on looking for the actual car that I wanted. Multiple test drives and all of my questions answered. After leaving the dealership to keep an open mind no other dealership came to quality service like Northwest Dodge. Never pressured to buy. It was how car buying should be done. ,5

Ed is exceptionally knowledgeable, helpful, forthright and honest. He is, by far, the best salesman I've ever dealt with (and I've purchased 9 vehicles in my life, including the 2 from Ed). He doesn't apply pressure, takes the time to understand your needs (I have a back condition that requires a certain form of seat) and will bend over backwards to ensure that you are satisfied with your purchase.

From what I read , my wheel sensors probably need to be replaced which everyone on the blogs said is somewhat easy. My car is still under warranty so I want to make sure a Dodge Dealer took care of this issue. I don't remember who my fiancé talked to, but the guy told him, I'd have to leave my car there for 3-4 days and they could not schedule a time for us to just drop off my car and pick it up. They also told him they would not provide a loaner car. This is the absolute WORSE customer service. Total BS. I was looking at buying a new 2016 RT Durango from them or Tomball Dodge, but it certainly won't be from this inconsiderate business. Tomball Dodge scheduled an appointment for me to drop off my car and said they will try to get me a loan car if it takes longer than promised.

Matt from service said i should have read owners manual. So i asked why they deny me she told me i only had 2 services not 4. i told her i have copy of receipts proving this .  she said if i did that would prove they are lieing and now they are reviewing the facts after i immediately sent in receipts . ( lesson here keep all receipts when dealing with liars in service ) or you will be screwed at every turn. i will repost the results. please at all cost stay as far from northwest dodge unless you have $70,000.00 to waiste on vehicle that will be worthless in a year. i am contacting Ken Graft the owner in a minute. i hope this helps others ( as of 9-22-16 truck still in shop total pricre is $6800. plus in parts in labor still no response from northwest dodge ) do not use this dealership for anything it does not matter how good thier sales department is if they will now service vehicle properly or advise you of future services needed then they lie to chrysker and say you never had service work you will end up with a blown up vehicle like me and parts not available i will be lucky if still in business next week. i will take them to court and sue them to recover all losses caused by thier negligence  i dont know how they even have a service department  ( ps with in 1 month of tire rotation now missing both front hubcaps not reinstalled properly ) the cost dont seem to end i bought my vehicle new with 57 miles  and put $20000 down and traded in mint 2012 dodge hemi  so if they treat me like this what chance do you have",1.2

85,29-Nov-16,I dropped off my Jeep Wrangler unlimited late in the afternoon at the dealership service center. I had to hunt down and find a service writer (only one on duty) and wait for him to finish his personal conversation. Then it took 30 minutes for 2 warranty items to be written up which at that point was still acceptable. When he laughed when i asked about the reserved vehicle and told me they take reservations 3 weeks in advance to be available and that they were out of rental vehicles that was when i started to get upset. But to top it off they said oh go over to the Nissan dealership they have plenty and all you have to do is climb over 2 fences and through the bushes to get to their dealership that is when I understand why the service department is so screwed up. Also when I talked with the Nissan folks they said that this happens all the time and is why they have so many crossover customers. Then the topper came when the service writer could not give me a firm date on when they will be able to service my vehicle and it will take about a week. Totally ridiculous. Poor management and it is obvious that no one cares about the customer. ,1.6

There were a couple of scratches on the vehicle that they gladly fixed. When I picked up the car, it was detailed and had a full tank of gas. Overall, a very positive experience.

71,21-Mar-17,"My Magnum has been in the shop since December 2016.   It sat for a couple of months, without contact, before receiving information that the service writer was no longer there.   Which left my vehicle in limbo.    Than, after telling me the car was repaired and ready for pick, I was forced to return the vehicle because the repairs where not adequate, having to return the vehicle.   It appears to me that the dealership has a problem with keeping service writers and/or techs.   I picked the vehicle up last Thursday or Friday, only having to return within 5 minutes.   Now, I don't know what's happening.   I'm never kept up to date on what is going on.    I've been having my car serviced and repair there since 2005.   Glenn Price was my first and the longest serving service write with the most integrity.   Since then,  I've been bounced around.    So, what's going on with my vehicle.    This is not the first time I've had to contact the upstairs office regarding the service of my Magnum.   I've been told by dozens of people that I've been too patient with Northwest Dodge and I should complain to Chrysler directly and move to another dealership, which there is one closer to my home.",2.4

63,13-Jun-17,I bought a brand new and very expensive Challenger from them. They seem to have forgotten it as they have to ask me the same questions every time I go in about the car's history. That's a minor thing. Their Service Department is beyond incompetent. From not having Nitrogen for months and totally messing up my tires and then refusing to refill the tires with Nitrogen because it's expensive to simply being very rude when asking to be educated about what work is being done to my car. I've been there 3 times and there is no way I am ever going back. ,1

I went up on Tuesday to get a value for my trade in, after being there a while,he comes back and tell the truck is $57,000 that is 13,000 more than the price that was advertised. I talk to the sales manager he told me they don't have to honor the price that was advertised. So I warn everybody to watch out for this shady dealership, I wouldn't trust them for scams they are doing that this dealership on the hard working people !!!!!####",1.3

51,09-Aug-17,"My boyfriend and I were given terrible customer service by this salesman. He didn't seem to care about anything we had to say when we were explaining our situation and he barely communicated with us during the process. he asked very few questions and hesitated a lot when we answered him. It was our first time looking into new sales and we were looking for someone who could be honest and respectful at the same time. He was very arrogant and rude when it came to negotiating prices, instead of being straight forward. Yes things didn't come out the way we wanted and we were understanding, but the way he treated us was unacceptable. Customer service should always be a #1 priority in sales, even if the deal might not work out. The dealership is nice, but I'd go with a different salesman. One who actually cares about the person and the vehicle, not just the car. Also, it's impolite to throw someone's DL onto the table where they're sitting, you should probably give it to them in their hand, like they gave it to you. It's just common courtesy. ",1
50,12-Aug-17,"My Dodge Ram 1500 driver side door lock and handle were damaged beyond repair after an attempted break in. NORTHWEST DODGE service FAILED to tell me body work was need in order to repair it correctly. Didn't bother to tell me they couldn't fix it right. But they could sure take $500 for a substandard repair. They changed the handle/lock. Gave it back to me with a loose door handle. When I brought it back to fix it, they tightened it slightly and said that's as good as it gets. NEVER TOLD ME BODY REPAIR WAS NEEDED TO FIX IT CORRECTLY. They also did a passenger airbag recall repair. Shoved the vent housing into the dashboard. Had to return to get that fixed. Also reinstalled the driver side door panel incorrectly after 2nd handle issue. Bowed out interior panel along the window ledge. I had to re-align it myself. THEN THEY ALSO FORGOT TO PUT A HUGE BOLT BACK INTO THE DOOR. Service manager, threw his service advisor under the bus, blaming him for not telling me body work was needed. AND they don't do body work there, so ASSUME they farm it out, charge you double and take their cut. THERE ARE PLENTY OF DODGE SERVICE DEALERS IN THE HOUSTON AREA.

43,28-Nov-17,"Not happy. This is the third truck we have purchased from North West Dodge. But this recent experience was not good. We did purchase a 2017  Ram 1500. We drove 50 miles to shop for a truck. After the deal we drove back home and by the time we got home the check engine light was on. 3 days later our sales guy did send someone to my job to pick up the truck and they provided a loaner, which was good. However when my truck was returned to me after 3 days, all my personal items I left in the truck were missing. I did call immediately, as well as several follow up calls to inquire about my missing items. I am not happy with this latest transaction, and most likely won’t return, nor will I refer anyone.

I just hope they can make good on this purchase if they can't fix it. Nate Shaw was very helpful in getting us a loner car when know one else would.

32,02-Mar-18,"NEVER go here for any reason.  Rude, unprofessional, condescending.  Service managers are terrible and blame other employees for mistakes.  Brought Jeep in Feb 19, for a transmission issue, was given the run around for 2 weeks. I was  told I would get a call in two days about what the car and the issue.   I never got the call.  I called 4-5 times during the 2 weeks to find out what the status was with my Jeep.  I was not given a rental car and told that they would not give me one until they determined it was a transmission issue. Finally, Feb 28th, after speaking with Jennifer in service, I was told to come in March 1st at 3 pm to pick up vehicle.  

After getting a ride to the dealership and waiting, I was told by Kenneth Turner, that no one has worked on my car, my car is not ready and that Jennifer should never have told me that it would be ready. He continued to berate me and blame a minimum wage employee for the false information I received.  He said that the car will be ready end of day, Friday and I could pick it up then. End of day, he kept reminding me.    It was only then that I was offered a rental car,which I refused.   In addition, when I asked him why my car has been sitting here since Feb 19th, he said ""I have cars here since December still waiting to be worked on"".  What a worthless service department and dealership.  

There is no excuse for their petty behavior and lack of professionalism.  ",1.4

16,15-Sep-18,"I have recommended this dealership to many family members,  but this is the first time I came with a financer trying to tell me the price that was on the window of the car was wrong , it's not the salesman fault. The overall price of the car was already negotiated. Why would a financer try to do that again?  First bad experience I've had here.",3
15,17-Sep-18,"To say I am frustrated is an understatement... I live 5 1/2 hours away and found a listing for a vehicle at this dealership I was interested it. I had been in contact with the salesman via email and text messages and worked numbers on the vehicle I was interested in for two days. I had finally gotten numbers I was happy with and told them I wanted to purchase the vehicle but since I live out of town it would be a few days before I can come in. After settling on a number that was in the ballpark, even though they needed to see my trade in person for concrete numbers, we had both some idea of where my payments were going to be. After agreeing I was then told that what they quoted for my trade-in was now going to be lower because they thought my vehicle was a V-8 and after completing the paperwork they realize it’s a V-6. So at this point I was already a little frustrated but am an understanding person and know mistakes happen and was still interested in purchasing the vehicle. Knowing I have great credit I NEVER give consent for credit checks until I am 100% sure I’m going to purchase something. At this point I was still OK with Numbers and had planned on making a trip to get the vehicle and turn in my trade. Being confident in my purchase I went ahead and gave consent and completed a credit application. My fiancé also talked to the manager and gave him his card information and told him to charge $200 to his card as a deposit to hold the vehicle over the weekend on Thursday. Today is Monday, and this morning without a doubt my mind I was going to Houston to pick up my new car! I was then texted that the vehicle I wanted was sent to auction over the weekend.... umm what?! I am so frustrated that my credit was ran and also the manager never charged my fiancé’s card to hold the vehicle. If this would’ve been done it would’ve communicated to other salesman and managers that the vehicle was no longer available and that someone was coming to get it. At least one would assume this especially after running my credit application on top of it. So not only was the quote for my trade-in originally wrong which changes the price, my fiancé‘s request to deposit was never completed, my credit was ran and docked, and now the vehicle I was going to purchase is gone. I am extremely upset, frustrated, and disappointed. I know that my credit check cannot be reversed, and the car cannot come back, so the only one losing here is me. At the very least I believe I am owed an apology and explanation as to why this happened. I’m already upset because I take pride in my credit history but to not contact me for several hours after telling me the vehicle is gone after running my credit is wrong and unprofessional and I believe at the very least I am owed an apology and explanation. 😡 ",1

5,27-Mar-19,"If I could give a lesser star for this ""establishment"" I would. Customer service? There is none, went in there and spend well over 60,000 dollars for what was supposed to be a brand new vehicle only to find out that it was what the managers drove. And boy did they drive the heck out of that vehicle. Had to wait around for financing for over two hours, apparently only one decided to work that day. Financing then, after we told them that we didn't like those numbers and that we were going to use our own financing decided to laugh at us. Wow that's unprofessional. We had to bring the vehicle back the next week because again the manager who drove it before us messed up the rims on one side and had weather stripping sticking out. So back we go to drive 30 miles to get something taken care of that honestly could've been fixed during our two hour wait when we purchased the vehicle last week. When we finally were able to pick up the vehicle after said things were fixed the radio had malfunctioned and the backup camera was no longer working properly. Not what you would expect when you buy a brand new vehicle, maybe from a used vehicle. Then came us waiting for them to pay of the vehicles that we had traded in. They told us the expected wait was no more than 10 days, flash forward to 3 weeks and they have yet to be paid off. Every time I would try to speak to dannie, who was our salesman, he would say he wouldget back to me but never would about the financing, he would get back to me about leaving a positive review for him but not about the things I had asked him. Finally got tired of dealing with Dannie so I demanded to speak to a manager, got transferred to the GSM, Jim. He seemed very understanding and was wanting to make things right. He said that he would find out why the vehicles had not been paid off yet and would get right back with me. Flash forward to the next day in the afternoon still no phone call from Jim with answers. I call again to figure out what the issue is and demand to speak to someone higher up. Now speaking to Rick the manager and he had no interest in making this right or doing any type of costumer service. Just a quick lesson for you boys down there at the office your customer service doesn't end when the client drives off the lot with said purchased vehicle. It continues on and on so that hopefully the customers come back to you for another one or they tell their friends and family about the wonderful experience they had and for them to purchase their next investment there. Customer service is how you want your business to be known for. Dearest dodge: is this how you want your business known for? Horrible customer service? Better yet no customer service? 

Update: found out through our bank that our check was cashed by the dodge dealership on the 15th. Now on the phone with corporate filing a formal complaint and will be speaking to my lawyer.

Update: spoke to corporate and they tried to get ahold of financing but no shocker here they weren't available. Case filed. I then called back to northwest dodge to speak to Rick (hope I'm getting that spelling right) the manager again to see what he had to say about the new information that I was told from our bank and to inform him that I had filed a formal complaint with corporate. He then proceeded to yell (yes yell, he raised his voice and verbally assaulted me) at me telling me that that was not what he said (talking about the check not being cleared) and that after telling him that I made a formal complaint against everyone we dealt with and gave them names he said ""I hope you get the spelling right"" then proceeded to yell at me some more. Wasn't till after I raised my voice and told him that he does not speak to a woman that way did he finally calm down enough to let me speak. I have never in all my years been treated with such disrespect from a huge company. I really hope someone sees this and sees that this company does not live by its values as it is advertised which says ""We treat people R.I.G.H.T. with Respect, Intelligence, Greatness, Honesty, and Teamwork."" Apparently your manager Rick didn't get this statement in his orientation.",1
4,27-Oct-19,"6 weeks ago we made an appointment for 30,000 mile maintenance on our 2018 Ram 3500..
We arrived early only to be told they would not be able to get to the truck today and didn’t know when they could but we had to leave the truck to stay in line for service and they would let us know. We currently are based in Austin so we then had to rent a car.
When we returned 3 days later to find the oil had not been changed and they claimed my husband that not told them about our maintenance contract we has received from this dealer when we purchased the truck  I had a copy with me and it was in their computer. and they were not going to honor it for the tire rotation or the filters that are required to be replaced at 30:000 miles.
They did the oil change while we waited took about an hour and they also washed the truck and didn’t charge us.
   Everyone was very pleasant. But we had returned because we had the maintenance contract and they had this sign that said 40% off maintenance services. We will not return The filters are required maintenance by Dodge. Tire rotation is clearly stated in the contract. They also did not adjust the tire pressure after rotating the tires.",2
3,22-Dec-19,Very disappointing experience. Will limit my spend to Oil Changes only. I have always struggled with the inflated cost of services but to have to deal with disrespectful employees claiming to be Management is unacceptable. Had a gentleman actually call me an xxxxxxx for looking for my truck when they could not find my Truck or Keys. I do appreciate Ms K Woods calling to apologize on behalf of her teammate. ,1

1,11-Feb-20,Worst customer service.  They claim that oil changes paid in advance don't expire and don't even give you a heads up when they do.,1
0,05-Jun-20,"Your are the worst dealership in Houston.  You ruin my sons car after it was brought in to get a seatbelt light off.  Now it needs an engine because as usual you did something wrong and will not fess up to your wrong doing.   I just beat cancer and I’m not going to be beaten by you.  That horrible service advisor Phil recommended some other services that it needed.  One of them was a flush where they did not replace the fluids.  We got down the street and the truck started smelling.  We pulled over and I said then that they forgot to replace the fluids.  We called but everyone was gone.  We had to wait till the dealership opened after the holiday.  Now they are saying it needs a new engine.  And we pay for it!!
It didn’t need one on the way in.  I’m not letting this go. I paid 1700 dollars for you to do some work not work to break his truck.  ",1
