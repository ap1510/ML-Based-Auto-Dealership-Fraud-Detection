3,"July 18, 2019","Kia has an amazing package deal. Great for families. Our sales person/communication leader Zach and I totally had opposite personalities where it would seem that a sale wouldn’t possibly been made, but when we both communicated with each other and understand each other we both personally came out on top. I believe that he made our family happy despite our differences. He overcame our differences in personalities selflessly when others would have thrown in the towel and because of that he worked extra hard to make me happy. He saw me for me and understood what my families needs were. We are all human and he took the cards that he was dealt with and made it into a positive experience for him and our family. Not only did he work through our differences he helped our family make a very important decision understandably possible, within reason and superseded our family’s expectations. He humbled himself to make sure that we were genuinely happy. That in itself speaks volume of how great of person he is and how dedicated and loyal to the company he advocates for.  It showed me and our family that he cared, which also speaks great  volumes about the choices Kia makes when hiring their team members. Just like family despite differences he had our backs no matter what. ",4.4
4,"July 15, 2019","I bought my first Kia here 6 years ago.  Although it was used, in 6 years I put gas in it, put new tires on it, and got my regular oil changes.  I never had any trouble with it.  So I came back for another Kia Rio.
This time, I've purchased a brand new one.  Only 11 miles on it.  
It's the first new car I've ever owned after over 4 decades of driving!  
I'm excited about the features this one has that I didn't have with my first Kia Rio.  The 10 year warranty has me feeling really secure.  The gas mileage is great, and I love the way it handles. 
the service was great all around.  Brandon really took his time with us.  He and the financial salesman worked with us to make it possible for us to afford it, and Brandon gave us lots of instruction regarding the way the car works.

5,"July 09, 2019","Went in to the Bloomington, Indiana Community Kia to trade in our current 2007 Sportage and purchase a newer used Sportage.  After working with Zachary Bird and getting a comparison of the warranties offered for both new and used we decided to purchase the last 2019 NEW Sportage that they had on the lot.  So happy to have a new Kia with all the bells and whistles and knowing that this will most likely be the last vehicle we will have to buy in our lifetime unless of course we live to be 100.",5.0
6,"May 15, 2019","I just purchased my 3rd Kia vehicle. I had been very impressed with my first two vehicles ( RIO and a Soul) and had to come back. I purchased a Kia Soul in 2016 and though I didn't always think it was the cutest car on the road - I was convinced it was reliable and a good fit for me. I was involved in an accident on May 4, 2019, I can honestly say that the Kia Soul is extremely safe. Airbags came from areas I didn't know there were air bags. Both vehicles in the accident were totaled. I had a couple bruises from the seat belt but was completely fine. As I began my new search for another car, I did visit other dealers to try different types of vehicles. Needless to say I ended back at Kia. The salesman, Zachary Bird was awesome and worked very hard with me to make something happen. We agreed on a 2017 Kia Soul with less than 5000 miles. I left the dealership and within ten minutes I had a call back from Zach. His manager, Bret Dearolf was thinking that they could do a better deal for me. I went back on that following Monday and drove home in a new 2020 Kia Soul. These guys are fantastic and I am totally sold on the Kia. I strongly suggest to all the buyers to give Kia a chance - they are impressive.

8,"April 30, 2019",I highly recommend that people steer clear of this dealership. Mr. Robert Stanten was very helpful but the Appraisal Trade-in Associate was not. I felt I was low balled and found the  dealerships  offers insulting. It was a waste of my time and I went ahead and purchased a vehicle somewhere else with a better trade in offer and a great sales price on my new vehicle purchase. Also they didn't want to honor the price as advertised on their own website. ,1.2

10,"November 29, 2018","We needed a vehicle to replace our wrecked one, which we also bought at this dealership. Over the years, I have come back to this dealership several times to buy vehicles for myself and my sons. I like the reliability of their used vehicles and their new ones offer great variety. We get our vehicle serviced here, and have confidence in their work. Caleb, our salesman, was informative and pleasant, not pushy at all.",5.0
11,"October 03, 2018","This was our first time to look at KIA vehicles. We were impressed. Micheal Grant was great to work with, as I’m sure I tried his patience while making up my mind on the vehicle and color to choose, He answered all our questions and was eager to make sure we were getting the car we wanted. Terry, General Manager, walked out in the rain to welcome us. That was so nice and unexpected. Collin our Finance man was so nice and fast on getting us taken care of. Mr.Grant had the car fueled up and ready to go when we finished the paper work. Very pleasant experience. ",4.8
12,"October 02, 2018","AS ALWAYS - I just purchased my 2nd Kia vehicle last week.  My salesperson was ""Caleb.""  I traded in my 2012 Kia Soul which I had bought new there as well, for a 2018 Kia Soul, this time, loaded with the options, and I LOVE IT. 

The sales & finance staff were great, and of course I haven't yet had the need to bring my new car in for servicing, but when I do, I expect the top-notch service I've already received by the service department!

I can genuinely say that I have no reservations recommending COMMUNITY KIA, BLOOMINGTON, INDIANA",5.0

24,"August 11, 2018","I spent 5 and a half hours at another Kia dealership (with my daughter for her own purchase which was an ABSOLUTE NIGHTMARE) the same day before I went in to Community Kia to purchase my own. The difference in the customer service I/we received is beyond comprehension. Community Kia was fast, totally professional, absolutely dedicated to me while they were working with me, friendly, AND I got a great vehicle at a great price.  I have purchased many vehicles in my life and this was by far the most painless and probably happiest experience I have had with a car dealership.  All around a very pleasant experience and I not only will continue to do business with them myself but I would recommend friends and family in a heartbeat.  ",5.0

31,"July 24, 2018","Went in for airbag light. Although out of warranty, they informed me coverage had been extended for my issue so there was no charge. Also notified me of three recalls needing to be addressed. Dropped it off Monday morning, they did all of the work that day, picked it up at five. Did a complementary oil change.

Got it fixed, paid nothing, free oil change. That's five star service to me.",5.0

From time to time employees spoke to me to see if I needed anything to more comfortable.  My car was serviced actually a bit earlier than my appointment and we completed in a very timely manner.  Once completed each item serviced and checked was gone over in detail along with estimates of time before additional future service might be required.

I spoke with Amy on the phone earlier in the week when I made the appointment to have the oil changed and, then again, when the service for my vehicle was complete.  My husband usually does the oil changes for the vehicles; however, he was not able to do so this time.  I decided to come to Kia Community because they did a recall service for my Kia a few months back and I thought that the mechanic and all involved did a great job.  I am just sorry that I did not catch the other two ladies' names (one at the service reception desk and the cashier).  I appreciate the Community Kia Service Department.

Amy checked my vehicle in and was so professional, prompt, and nice.  I so appreciate her excellent attitude.  I brought my vehicle in for a recall and it appears that Ricardo (88) did a GREAT JOB attending to the recall and the complementary Kia Multi-Point Inspection (thanks for that - helps me know what may be requiring attention soon).  I also appreciate the lady who verbally reviewed the multi-point inspection with me upon the pickup of my vehicle.

They provided the easiest buying experience without any pressure sales tactics or other questionable sales methods that you experience at other dealerships. Before buying my Soul from Community, I had walked out of a few other dealerships due to this kind of behavior. For the past year, since I purchased my Soul, I have had all service done at the dealership. They send out monthly coupons, have a comfortable waiting area with complimentary snacks while you wait. I highly recommend purchasing your next Kia from Community. ",5.0
84,"August 05, 2017","I feel like we have covered this in the previous review, but I will reiterate the high points of said review.  We appreciate the fact that we were not swarmed when we got to the dealership.  Our salesman let us wander at our leisure, then he answered questions and made suggestions.  Robert Staten (our salesperson) was very knowledgeable about KIA's products and was friendly to boot.  After we made our tentative decision, he helped us negotiate a deal we could manage and were happy with.  The financial manager was also friendly and guided us through the process as painlessly as possible.  All in all the dealership was well run, clean, and a positive atmosphere for what is not normally a desirable situation for our family.

86,"August 04, 2017","We came to Community Kia to browse for a Soul. Robert Staten came out and spoke with us. After telling him what we came to look at, he got us some keys and let us shop through them. He encouraged us to test drive one around the block. We drove the soul around and came back with even more interest than we had before. Once we came in Robert asked us what we thought about the car. We really liked the car. He also brought up the warranty benefits of buying a Kia and that he would try his best to get us into one that same day even thou we had nothing for a down payment. After speaking with him about all the different options available to us, we decided to get one. He didn't even mind that we were not 100% sold on the color that we wanted so he brought us back out to see all the colors that Community Kia had available. He was very patient with us and was never pushy or overbearing. Robert is really the reason we bought a Kia Soul that day. Our experience with the finance department was very pleasant. Boliver Allmon was great about explaining the buying experience and answering all our questions. Community Kia is really an excellent dealership!",5.0
87,"July 10, 2017","Would give zero stars if possible.  Like other posts I have read, we had the same disreputable business service as others.  Found a vehicle on their website, made an appointment to test drive, within hour of appointment we called to verify it was still available and to let them know we were on the way because we were driving an hour to get there.  Yep, get there to be told the vehicle had been sold.  The person our appointment was with was not there, evidently the appointment confirmation is a generic form with Internet Sales Manager, Richard Battle, name on it.

After I left I noticed 2 nicks in the windshield and scuffs on the paint. I called and spoke to Willie who said Yes bring it in and we will get it taken care of and give me a loaner.  So I did that following Monday. I was given the loaner car by Willie. It was a 2010 Chevy cobalt. So this is where it begins. It had a horrible smoke smell. The interior was completely dirty and had not been cleaned. The check engine light was on and the car had over 80k miles on it.  I didn't complain because I was needing to leave.  I called Max after leaving and said the check engine light was on. He said that it's fine it just needs to have the computer reset. That next day the car was making horrible noises.  I called Max on my way home from work and he said ""I'm on my way out to get my girls....but you live close by just hurry and come"".  So I did. He put me into another loaner that was a 2013 kia soul..... This one was dirtier than the first. Had bags and diapers every where. Someone's personal stuff and a dirty fuzzy stirring wheel cover. I felt like I could catch something in this car or waiting for a roach to show up. I said do yall ever clean these cars.

104,"March 05, 2013","This is a letter I sent to the owner of Community Kia, Roger Elswick, after our purchase at their dealership. (We never received a response, just goes to show how they truly don't care about the customer or the customers experience.) It is lengthy, but it spells out exactly what we had to deal with when buying from Community Kia, dishonest people at a dishonest dealership, that lack the ability to offer quality customer service.

Hi Mr. Elswick. I wanted to contact you in reference to a recent used car purchase we made with your Kia dealership, Saturday, January 26. My husband and I have been searching for the perfect minivan for our family in our price range, we found it at your dealership. At least we thought it was the perfect minivan when we drove it off the lot. We were very excited to have found our minivan with all the options we were looking for, decent mileage for a used vehicle, nice color, interior in decent shape, drove nice, etc. However, the very next day, Sunday January 27, on our way to church the check engine light came on. After church, my dad hooked it up to his computer to see what code it was pulling. Sure enough, it pulled 0420, Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold (Bank 1). There is no coincidence that the check engine light came on the day after we drove off your lot. I guess I should mention that when test driving, my husband noticed that the Navigation was locked. Al sent us over to your Honda dealership, said to say Willie sent us, and Paul came out and unlocked it in 2 minutes. After unlocking it, he proceeded to tell us that the only time it locks itself is if the battery is unplugged. So, I'm not saying that your service department was trying to be shady, but it sure screams slimy business when the check engine light mysteriously comes on the day after we drive our car off your lot. Especially since we know the battery had been unplugged, causing the Navigation to lock. I understand that when you sign an ""as is clause"" that there is an understanding the car could have some issues. In my opinion, you can't be aware of an issue if someone is trying to hide that issue from you. Seems like when your name is Community Kia, Community Honda, etc, that you want to be an upstanding business in the community. How can you be that business when your service department is hiding problems with used vehicles from buyers. That's a horrible way to do business, and I don't know how you, your salesmen, or your service department personnel can sleep at night knowing you are doing shady business. So, my husband, Garrett, called your dealership Monday morning to ask what your guys could do about it, since it was blatantly obvious you were trying to hide the problem from us in the first place. My husband spoke with Willie. He told Garrett that he would speak to the service department and call him back. When that afternoon rolled around and Garrett hadn't heard a word from Willie, he called back and spoke with a William. William then told Garrett he wanted us to bring the van in to Honda to have their technician look at the problem. Garrett called Paul at Honda, since he had helped us with the navigation on Saturday. Paul told Garrett for me to talk directly to him and he would take care of things. Let me add, we live in Waller, an hour and a half from your dealership. So, I, being the stay at home mom, get childcare for my 4 year old, and tote my 2 year old along with me to the dealership on Tuesday morning. I get there and Paul asks if I wanted his guy to bring me home. I laughed and said, I live an hour and a half from here, I don't think your guy wants to drive that far. He asked if Willie was going to put me in a rental. I told him there had been no mention of that. So, thankfully, Paul moved fairly quickly and got things squared away and had Enterprise rent me a car. I specified with him that we would not be paying for the rental or mileage on the rental, he reassured me that no, Kia would be footing the bill. So, I come home in my rental, still hoping that your dealership would do the honest thing and take care of an issue that should have either A. been presented to us when test driving your vehicle, or B. been taken care of by your dealership without hiding it from future buyers. That afternoon, my husband hadn't heard any news, so around 4:00 he called Paul to see if there was any updates. Paul told him the cost would be $917, parts and labor. He said that Willie would be willing to ""do us a favor"" and cover the parts, and we would have to cover the labor. Willie was supposed to have called Garrett to figure everything out, but since Willie didn't call Garrett, Paul wasn't able to order parts that day and was going to have to wait to order parts on Wednesday. Paul then told Garrett that Willie only wanted to pay for 1 rental day, seeing as how Willie drug his feet and never called my husband like he was supposed to (mind you he has never returned a call to my husband when he said he would, my husband was always the one that had to call him), we were going to have to make an extra trip on Wednesday to take back a rental and be without a car because Willie can't return or make a phone call like he says he is going to. My husband then called Willie to see what the issues were with everything. Garrett had to wait on hold for 20 minutes for Willie to pick up the phone, the receptionist asked him if he wanted to leave a message and Garrett told her that no he would not leave a message because Willie doesn't know how to call people back. So, he waited. When finally getting Willie on the phone, Garrett asked him why hadn't he received a phone call back. Willie then started in with his millions of excuses, telling my husband that he didn't have to help us since we bought an 'as is' vehicle, even though your dealership was shady in the first place by resetting the code, but y'all can't own up to that because that would mean you would have to be honest and that's obviously not a word associated with your dealership. My husband, never once was rude to any of your employees, was always nothing but nice in trying to fix this issue, but your employee Willie was intent on being condescending in the manner of telling him that he was ""doing us a favor"" by offering to pay for parts. Let me add, this van has sat on your lot since November, we were told that the van was ""almost sold"" a few times before us, but those interested were unable to get financing, supposedly. So, the way we see it is we did y'all a favor by getting financing and buying the car in the first place, but Garrett was told that ""y'all could put it on Ebay and have it sold in no time"". So, your dealership is willing to take a car back from a couple who finds the underlying issue of a check engine light revealing that the catalytic converter needs to be replaced, $1000 in work and parts, but you will unplug the battery again and clear the code and then put it on Ebay and sell ""the problem"" to someone else. Anyway, Willie told Garrett that we would have to pay for everything up front and y'all would mail us a check to cover the parts, almost $1000 that we weren't planning to put into that car so fast. $1000 that we shouldn't have to have put into that car period. But, you guys are doing us a favor. Willie then agreed to let us keep the rental an extra day, yes, let us.

I find it sad that it's hard to find a dealership these days with honest owners, hiring nothing but honest people. Is this how you want your dealership to be known as??? Dishonest?? Can you honestly say that you guys weren't at fault in this matter? How would you feel if you were in our shoes, you and your wife had just bought a used car, the next day the check engine light comes on? You would feel taken advantage of and ultimately sorry that you made the purchase. Don't get me wrong, we love the minivan, we are sorry we weren't told the truth or even given the chance to see the check engine light and make our own decision. Will we be using your dealership or any dealership in your group of ""Community"" dealerships? No. We will never be back to any of your establishments, and we will be leaving feedback on every website we find associated with your dealerships. We think others should know what they are potentially walking into when they consider buying a car from you. They can expect dishonest business by dishonest employees. Frankly, that's sad, with a name like Community, you'd think you could trust you'd be walking into a dealership who takes pride in how they do business, and by doing so is honest in how they do business, but that's not Community Kia.

Sadly, we were extremely happy Saturday when we drove off your lot. Our girls were so excited to be in their ""new"" car, we were excited to have a ""new"" car that we could be proud of. It's very hard to be proud of your ""new"" car when you have to fork out $1000 the next week for an issue that should have never been an issue. I hope that there isn't another young couple that walks into your business and is taken advantage of like we were. I hope that no one else has to have this feeling when doing business with you. I hope that no one else has to scramble to figure out how they are going to come up with $1000 to fix an unnecessary issue. It's actually laughable to read your ""about me"" page and see your statements and views on customer service. We saw none of that when dealing with your dealership. The only time we received decent customer service was when dealing with Paul at Honda, and he isn't even an employee of Kia. You say, ""Serving the Baytown community with integrity and abiding commitment, the Community principle of serving the community is something we apply in our business transactions every day. We provide more than just pre-owned or new Kias and service, we offer Baytown and surrounding communities quality service and commitment comparable to that of a family’s."" If this is how a family treats each other, hiding problems, then making you find them and pay for them. That's not a family I want to be a part of. You also say, ""Community Kia’s concentration in customer satisfaction has served as a premise for our business, and our community involvement has helped us become fully aware of Baytown’s needs. For this reason our entire services are shaped to meet these needs diligently, without hesitations."" Well, we still don't feel as if our needs have been met, let alone met diligently or without hesitation. This entire ordeal has been nothing but a headache. I really wish I could be writing this email to you saying that your dealership is amazing and did an outstanding job in helping us, but I'm not.

I hope you have taken the time to read the entirety of this email and taken time to think about it and take it to heart. It seems to me that you need to make some changes in your business, because you are not living up to your motto. In my opinion, when one customer walks away unhappy, you have failed at your job. ""All in all, the Community Group focuses on the community; our low prices; first-rate quality; and outstanding customer service to ensure customer satisfaction 100% of the time!"" Guess you should change that to 50% of them time. Because we were discarded as if our satisfaction meant nothing.

Since sending this letter, we have yet to receive our license plates. When my husband called the first time about them, he was told they ""couldn't"" mail plates (we live an hour and a half from this dealership, not driving all the way there for plates), this was after calling and talking to a hand full of people and being told to call someone else, then someone else, etc. I finally called to follow up after my husband was told by the Sales Manager that he would ""look into it"" (never heard anything back of course), and was of course told to call someone at their Toyota dealership, who told me to call my salesman (who hung up on me for no reason), then I had to call their Toyota dealership again and speak to their title department, again, to make sure they had my address correct, and was hung up on yet again (supposedly a mistake). So, if you want to speak to someone on the phone, good luck finding the correct person in the first place, and keeping them on the phone. I won't even mention their Internet Salesperson who told us we would get free XM radio for coming in and making a purchase, she was wrong about that, and we were given an ""IOU"" for $100, and told we would be mailed a check for that mistake. It's 2 months later and we haven't seen the check. They are ""looking into that' as well.

My advice, just steer clear of Community dealerships. If you want work done on your Honda, go talk to Paul. He is a wonderful guy, who will do his best to give you the quality customer service you deserve in an honest manner. He is the ONLY person I would do business with in that group of dealerships, I will, however, never be going back to any of those dealerships simply because of how we were handled by the people at Community Kia. Go search for another dealership, they aren't worth your time or money.",1.0

106,"October 25, 2012","Everyone at this dealership is as friendly as can be, there's no problem with how they treat their customers or potential customers.

However, I knew I should have walked out of there when, after I agreed to a price on a 08 Focus, my salesman, Floyd, walked over to a room with glass walls I could see through, started dancing around and giving high fives to the other guys in the room!

I somehow agreed to the Focus after having driven a different car that day, and not taking a close look at the car. This was my own mistake that I now regret. The fact is, though, this place is shady.

The car had two dents on the drivers side I didn't even notice until later that weekend. Fine, I let that go. Worse, though, was that it was kinda noisy. It seemed to run fine to me, and I thought that's just how the car sounded. Pretty much a year to the day later, my dad heard it and said something sounded wrong with a bearing or tensioner. I planned on taking it in to the service center and having it looked at, since my 2 year ""bumper to bumper warranty"" was supposed to cover everything under the hood and car, save for tires, brakes, AC and fluids, routine things.

Sure enough, a week later I throw the belt, driving home from work. The tensioner or pulley was bent at an odd angle I could clearly see, now that the belt was off. Long story short, my bumper to bumper warranty does not even cover the circumtine belt and tensioner. My only question is, what DOES the bumper to bumper cover? Whatever isn't broken yet, until it breaks?

I realize I should have been smarter buying this car, and tending to that noise sooner, but the fact remains that they sold this car like that. Dents, messed up tensioner, and for $15,200! I was a complete idiot for buying this car from Community Kia, in Baytown, but that doesn't change the fact that this is a totally dishonest car dealer. Don't be fooled by the friendly personalities.",2.5

108,"April 24, 2012","I made the trek to Community Kia in Baytown from across town after receiving a good internet sales quote from Shana on a Kia Optima.  The test drive went well and my saleperson Traci was very nice to work with.  It wasn't until I started talking numbers when it all went south (doesn't it always).  
The Sales Manager started off with a decent quote but he was adamant that the price only was valid for a 3 year lease, limited miles, and a balloon payment at the end of the lease.  I contradicted that I was not interested in leasing and he rebutted that it was not a lease by throwing out terms like balloon payment, residual value, etc. - A LEASE!  The encounter turned around when he offered to let me take the car home for the weekend to test drive and make a decision which I was more than happy to do.  Obviously at that point the car had been test driven numerous times or loaned out as it had 675 miles on the odometer.  I drove the car for the weekend fully expecting to return to purchase it on Monday as it is a nice vehicle.
The price negotiation began again when I returned with a different General Manager, this time straying away from the original price quote because I wanted to finance the car without the lease.  All of the sudden the price jumped another $500.  
To wrap up this review, I thought we had agreed upon a price that was satisfactory to me, the numbers were configured to exceed my price request for a drive out total (drive out = total price of the car inc. all taxes, title, doc. fee, minus rebates; obviously not to this dealership, it means a financed price plus a TTL down payment), and I canceled the deal after going round and round with the General Manager about how I had been mislead.
All of the headaches from shopping at Community Kia along with the numerous drives I had to make out made this car buying experience the worst I have EVER had!  Good riddance and good luck to the person who buys the car with 900 miles already on it.",1.8

115,"July 12, 2011","Well I have to say that my overall experience was just DISAPPOINTING. The staff is super nice, but I feel they are a little dishonest. I went in originally on Friday the 8th of July. I spoke with Shana with internet sales and she assured me that a deal could be worked just come in and ask to speak with her. I did this and was approached by Al, another very friendly person. He spoke with me VERY briefly and Rich, one of the finance people, very unapproachable, spoke with me as well. Unfortunately for me they could not help me and they were honest as to the reason why. Then on Monday the 10th I received a call from a very friendly guy by the name of Lincoln. He also seemed very nice, confident and sure that he could work a deal for me even after the other gentlemen could not. Now mind you all these people work at the same dealership. Unfortunately communication is not their strongest suite. So I spoke with him told him what I had spoken to Al and Rich about, what they had told me and told him the same thing I told them. I had nothing to put down, needed my payments to stay where they were and what I wanted in a car. Well Lincoln PROMISED me he could get this done, even told me I had been approved for a loan, He could keep my payments where they were with nothing down and all he needed was to see the trade in. Well I already new what I would get for that, Rich and Al gave me that info. Long story short, Lincoln came back to me after I insisted I did not want to look at the vehicle unless I knew I was going to get it, Gilbert assured me I would get it, and Lincoln tried to tell me that I had to pay $200 dollars more than what I was paying monthly and I was not able to do that of course. So the moral to the story is that these guys are no better than a lawyers. They weasel you into the door by talking sweet and confidently to you and then set you up for a disappointment. I read several reviews on this dealership and felt OK with it. But honestly there is no such thing as getting what you want. I probably could have looked at a much cheaper vehicle but the size of my family is the biggest factor. So needless to say, if your a Hamster and can drive in a compact car then go for it you can pretty much afford it. If you want what your looking for you need to go in with a paid off luxury vehicle and a pocket full of cash.",3.0
