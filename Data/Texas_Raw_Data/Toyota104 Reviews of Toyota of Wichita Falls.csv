His courtesy and care to work with us was greatly appreciated and impressive.   We found the model car we wanted and after picking up the car we had and have only one question at present to be answered.  We noticed a day or so after receiving the car, that there was not exterior molding (I thought I had added this feature) and the paper work I have does not provide me enough information to determine if that extra was included in the price.  I still would like to determine if it was or not,  ",4.6
