0,"June 17, 2020",Very disappointed how unresponsive this dealership was. Phone calls and emails were unreturned and ignored. I even tried to contact the sales manager and he didn’t return calls. I bought a vehicle at Fernandez instead. They were very responsive. The only person who responded and tried was Clarissa Gomez. Kudos to her. ,1.0
1,"July 20, 2019","I've had two buying experiences here, one when the dealership was Fiesta Honda and the other now that it is Northside Honda.  Both times I received a good vehicle at a decent price.  The first time I was satisfied with my experience in finance, the second time I was not.  I've made multiple trips and calls to Northside to learn the status of a couple refunds from the last car.  On one of the trips, they realized they had not yet refunded the old service contract as promised and did so.  As far as the $500 left from the last GAP policy, I don't think I'll ever see it.  The GAP company confirms they cut the check two months ago and the dealership already cashed it.  Nobody in finance knows anything nor can they point me in the direction of somebody that can help.  Overall I feel things were better when the dealership was Fiesta.  ",3.4

Northside Honda
is THE WORST PLACE TO BUY A CAR!!! OMG, tell me why the finance manager after we left his stupid cubicle, and i went outside ready to LEAVE. he comes out four DIFFERENT times for me to sign papers he forgot about....sounds trusting eh? IM LITERALLY LEARNING HOW TO USE THE CAR, and this MAN KEEPS COMING UP TO ME FOUR TIMES Because he is a finance manager who doesn't know his paperwork.
Plus paperwork was wrong he put down that i was going to be going for 15K Miles for 36months and the wrong payment. I agreed to 12K Miles for 36months. And he gave me a different price that is different by what i initialed to agree upon. ( i have NO CLUE where he got this quote FROM! outer space?!?!?!?! do you ALL NOT COMMUNICATE?!?!?!?!?!
He put the wrong address on my paperwork and i told him that isn't the right one, he goes back to TALK back to me and say WELL we do not just put anything there you gave us something with this address. i open up his little yellow folder with my info and i take out my DL paper that they copied and showed him. Look that's my address. and he said WELL SOMETIMES THIS HAPPENS. yeah it happens but you can talk to me in a tone as if im the one who messed up.
This guy doesn't have a clue what's going on, your corporate office doesn't know a xxxx thing, your salesman do not even know the horsepower of a 2.0 Accord, i mean what else? Why do you even have a business?
im not one to complain but DAAAAAMNNN they did SUCH A HORRIBLE JOB!!!!!
The finance man even forgot to get my down payment $$$. Worst idea ever to come here. i don't write reviews and talk openly in public about things like this but WOW WOW WOW
they surprised me. im 1,00,000 UNSATISFIED.
DO NOT GO HERE!!!!! since the finance guy forgot to take my downpayment he came outside to get me to come back. after he power walks to his office leaving me behind to go find him because of his mistake i found his little office.. that's how you treat your guests who go buy 30+ thousand dollar cars?? WOW
im pretty upset. and i want to thank Northside Honda for making me HATE this place. I do not trust not a single one of them.
thank you for ruining the fun time i was going to have in the car. you replaced it with negativity because of your customer service. wait there isn't any.
Let me know if you need a honda i can help you get one from somewhere else. You will be 100% wasting your time i promise you that. They do not know how to do business and need a lot a lot a lot of help. Time is value, and your value is 100% wasted here.
All i am for THEM is a commission for the managers and their salesmen.
SoOOOo all in all i learned my lesson. do not give your money to hungry feens who only want their stupid commission and meet their sales goals. honestly for how rude they were i should have just walked out of that xxxxing place. Now i know better. Also i want to honestly take care of you guys. i do not want you to go through the things i went through.",1.0
3,"September 08, 2018","I went to Fiesta Honda and everything seemed smooth. Although it was smooth I felt as if the customer service was o.k. The salesman and the other sales manager I worked with seemed like they only cared just enough to not seem like a's. This made every minute uncomfortable to a degree, I felt like all I was happy with was the car, the price a bit, and just felt awkward through the process when I was with these guys. The only saving grace I believe was... Angela at he food counter in the morning shift, Vicki at the reception desk and Christopher(salesman) that day. Nonetheless great price, both good/helpful and figity/awkward people. 

The old saying personality makes the company is true. And this place misses the mark but still gets 3.5 stars",3.2
4,"July 30, 2018",Beware.  Not there to help you buy and finance a vehicle as an honest business.  You need an experienced person in purchase and finance or you will walk out without your shirt.  They are there to maximize the profits at every turn.  They ware you down with extended wait time and slick operators.  Not for someone looking for an honest turn on your dollar.,1.4
5,"June 20, 2018","Check your brand new cars before leaving!! Customer service was good they made sure I was happy with everything but all that great service went out the door when i drove off with my brand new car , after a couple of days one of my friends noticed a scratch on one of my rims on the driver side and when I looked closer I found both my drivers side rims were scratched and of course I took the car in to get it looked at and they took pictures but said they would contact me in a couple of days to let me know what was going to get done and of course they did not answer my emails after several days and kept saying they would look into it and get back at me. after several weeks they finally responded and said I made those scratches and that they weren't going to do anything about it. So my advise, even though you might be buying a brand new car make sure it is not damaged anywhere because they will do nothing about it after you leave.",1.0
6,"June 04, 2018","A very dishonest team!

Between the final negotiated price to actual signing of the contract, they increased the purchase price and tried to explain that it was for internal purposes and my final cost should be the same, unfortunately it was not!

Stay away from this dealership!  There are 2 others in the San Antonio area who are willing to take your business.",1.7

9,"February 23, 2018",I worked with Sasha on a purchase of my car. She is friendly and very pleasant to work with. I would definitely recommend her and a dealership to my friends.

Overall I'm very satisfied with the experience.,5.0
10,"February 19, 2018","If you buy a car from this dealership make sure and ask for Val, he jumped through hoops to get my sister and I the car we wanted and in our price range. Very genuine guy, and just wants what’s best for his customers.",5.0
11,"February 15, 2018","We arrived 20 minutes until closing. We were looking for a new vehicle, the staff opted to show their inventory towards what we were looking for and staying open after hours which might not have seen a purchase . We test drove a typical unit to get a feel for what we wanted. The manager offered the show room model which had more bells and whistles for the same price. We have purchased other vehicles from other dealerships like ""simple price"" which made us feel obligated to buy. This purchase has been the best experience. Thank you Fiesta.",5.0

16,"January 26, 2018",Val made purchasing a vehicle very easy . We had just moved to the area with our three month old baby and needed a car that would be safe for him . My husband had a truck and the CRV provided all the space we needed for cargo and is not too large for me to drive ( I am 5 ft 3 in ). Val explained everything very well and knows all the features that are worth purchasing . We got it all taken care of within 24 hours and they were flexible with our schedules . Highly recommend .

27,"June 11, 2017","Fiesta Honda Dealership is simply amazing. While customers wait on their vehicle, they insist on you going to a customer wait room with generous snacks and treats for you while you wait. I was in such a panic about my huge oil Leak Problem and Mr Tobin took great care of Everything! They were so patient, kind, and made sure that each customer was helped. I greatly appreciate Mr Tobin as well as Carlos for their PHENOMENAL service! I highly recommend anyone who needs service on their Honda vehicle to come here! ",5.0

I wish I  never gone there. I  charged more than should be. I have the quote for a car that I check but I bought a car with same features with different price on contract. Now you can judge",2.2

31,"May 28, 2017",From the moment I had been contacted by fiesta I had been pushed aside. For example when I arrived thinking I was talking to a sales rep I was pushed aside. I was treated like like I wasn't important when one of the donts is you take care of the customer that arrived first not push him off to another salesman wrong answer. Made me feel unimportant. They don't listen to you when you don't have a down. Then I had surgery in January for a hernia so I missed two months of work. The salesman didn't listen to the customer . And then they had Ford F-150 they didn't even inspect but they had it on their website. They need to listen to what customers are saying,2.0
32,"May 24, 2017",This is our third Honda from Fiesta dealership. Was in & out in less than two hours. Oscar was professional and provided great service. Will be back,4.8
33,"May 17, 2017","I always get answers on my questions.   Some of the employees understand the inner workings of the complex dash board settings which at times can be intimidating to us.  I only wished they gave classes at the time of purchase regarding these settings.   A one on one presentation is given but who remembers what they say when you just made such a big purchase?  Otherwise, we love the Touring CRV!   It's fantastic and we love to travel in it.  We have noticed a change in personnel lately and when it  changed hands a few years ago.   We also live 5 minutes from this dealership!  So convenient!",4.4
34,"May 17, 2017",Had to have major repairs which required overnighting parts.  Received a loaner car for 3 days.  Alena was very helpful and contacted me about the progress of the repairs.,4.6
35,"May 03, 2017","Terrible.  Once the deal is done so is the good service.  Bought my car a year ago 3 months in they recommend that I get new brake pads.  Take the car to my mechanic, I was at the dealership for service because I bought the service package (more on this in a minute).  My shop says that the brakes are only half way through the life of the wear on them.  So ok make a note that this dealership tried to get me.  A car wash comes with the service and believe me if it wasn't free I wouldn't waste my time.  I would rather take it to a fundraiser car wash than pay for the wash.  I have asked for a call from the finance manager to discuss what to do with my remaining service since I am moving and there is no transfer mechanism to transfer them to another dealer.  I was told that I needed to come in and fill out a form. I am moving... can the form be emailed to me? No you have to come in and fill it out.  So I show up.  Ask to speak to someone in finance, and now told no one is available.  I am handed a form and asked to fill it out and fax it back.  ""So it could have been emailed to me?"" I ask.  Receptionist says she doesn't know not her department.  Cool, can I speak with whoever s department it is. No they are unavailable.  I bet if I was buying a car someone would talk to me.  I get better service from the shade tree car dealership I bought my 1999 Tahoe at 7 years ago, and they have no vested interest in me as a customer.  This dealership never calls me back.  After the brake incident I asked to have a service manager call me so I could see what happened, crickets. I have called the finance manager and left a message, twice, crickets.  They can send me emails about cashing in the equity I have on my car or whatever they want to do to try and get me back in the buyer seat again.  Never going to happen.  I wont step foot back in this place for service or purchase another vehicle.",1.4
36,"March 19, 2017","After fixing the gas snesor in the gas tank, some gas got onto the carpet. I returned the next day to tell them about it. Immediately they gave me a loaner car, took my Pilot to the detailer and had the entire interior cleaned and made sure it was completely void of any gas odor. I couldn't have asked for a more satisfactory end to a mistake.  Thanks Alicia and everyone in Fiesta Service",5.0

38,"March 08, 2017","Bought a 2008 from Fiesta Honda, drove to Florida and had to call many time and no one had the decency to call me back.  The upper management are pieces of Crap.  My sales person, Richard Furst, was very nice before I bought the car, now he does not even call back and answer my many questions.  The finance guy, Ruben Lopez was very charming, but now no return calls.  The Supervisor, Phillip, was very angry at me and told me all sales are final.  He is the worst of the worst.  The Service is very poor.  They don't respect women at Fiesta Honda.  Bunch of RED NECK, xxxxxxxx.  You have other choices, go to other Honda dealers, but Fiesta Honda.  Nothing good about them.  They are liars and cheaters.  I have been waiting for the plates for 5 weeks, called day and night, no one knows where the plates are.  I called Austin, DMV, they checked and found no submission of the paperwork.  This is ridiculous.  DMV told me I should lodge a complaint about Fiesta Honda.  I had the complaint in my e mail.  I called Fiesta Honda to tell them about my intention when I was told the plates are in their office and will FedEx them to me, asap.  What the xxxx..  I said to myself.  If you can avoid them, please do.  They are NOT HONORABLE PEOPLE!!",1.2
39,"February 15, 2017",Nathan Thomas is a commendable young salesman. He imparts knowledge and understanding in ways that we 80 year olds could follow easily. He found the perfect car for us at a price we found more than acceptable. The entire experience was efficient and thorough. We want you to know this young man is a terrific asset to your dealership. We cannot complement him enough. He is outstanding. J Ash,5.0

41,"December 14, 2016","I took my car in for oil change and the latest recall from Honda. I was greeted and politely sent into the service rep area to let them know what services I needed done to my car. Aleena was very knowledgeable and friendly and explained the recall would require several hours. She offered the shuttle service to drive me to my home and would let me know by phone what service was needed after the free inspection of the car was completed. Sure enough, she called and told me there were several things that needed to be watched, but no further service was needed today. She said she would call back when the car was ready and the shuttle would pick me up to return for my car. Everything was great. The shuttle driver was very polite and drove very safely. Aleena was great and I will go back again for my expert Honda service. Oh yeah, I almost forgot. I found a coupon on their website an my oil change was done at a discount too! Great day at Fiesta Honda. ",5.0
42,"December 09, 2016",The service department is so disorganized.  I scheduled bringing in my Honda for an airbag recall.  I had to cancel my appointment because I lost my ride home.  I called to schedule for the next week and was told they don't have the airbag in stock and it would take 4 weeks to get it.  What would have happened if I had shown up the previous week as scheduled?  Apparently the person who made the first appointment was unaware that they would be unable to service my car at the scheduled time. ,1.0

46,"August 02, 2016","Worst car buying experience ever. My husband and I were looking for a new Honda vehicle recently and was in discussion with Fiesta Honda for almost a week and discussion was not coming to any conclusion. For almost one week, they called us everyday giving stupid deals but not coming to a conclusion. After one week, they called us and left a voicemail saying that we are ready to make the deal in -- price. After getting that voicemail, we tried to contact them for the whole day to make sure that we got them right but no one responded. In evening, thinking about the saved voicemail from their manager, we reached the facility but they were again making all stupid offers and not even considering or bothering about what they said on the voicemail Wasted whole evening.

Very bad staff behavior and can't even keep their own words. Even when you have a proof of what they said to you over the phone. No plans of ever doing business with them.",1.0
47,"June 19, 2016",My husband and I were dealing with another Honda Dealership.  The time frame to finally receive  a negotiation price took almost a week with no satisfaction.  My husband called Benson Honda on Saturday and spoke with BRANDON SANTIAGO and explained our dire need of a specific vehicle.  Within 30 minutes BRANDON returned our phone call with promising to beat the other dealerships price.  We arrived at 8:30 p.m. and left at 9:45 p.m. with an amazing satisfied drive out price.  At this point just waiting on PDI and Monday morning we will be driving out as super happy customers.  He made it hassle free & with 4 kids time is of the essence. BRANDON expedited our needs as a priority.  We have purchased several vehicles in the past & I must say this was the most pleasant experience.  Thank you BRANDON !!,5.0

52,"December 07, 2015","I arrived with the tow truck hauling my crashed car.  Blany Raby and Joe Pfeifer in the Collision Center took excellent care of me.  But the man who went above and beyond was Antonio Segovia. He drove me all the way home at 7pm without a thought for his personal time.
My experience was so good that I decided to shop the Benson Honda used cars on line.  I found 10 I wanted to look at.    I called Mr. Raby the next day and he alerted the sales department to take good care of me.  I arrived at 5pm and was immediately taken under the wing of Michael Lingan.  He drove me around 2 different lots so I could see all of the cars that I wanted to see.  He knew that I had to leave at 7pm, but he did not rush me and continued to watch out for my time.
Even though the time was short I was able to negotiate a very favorable deal on a car.  I left at 7pm and returned the next day to efficiently close the deal.
I highly recommend Benson Honda for any car needs you have.  They will certainly be my car dealer from now on.

58,"September 12, 2015","I bought 3 more cars from Benson Honda thanks to my superior salesman Rob Drury!  I took my daughter to get her first car and I was trading in my 2015 pilot for a smaller car.  I really didn't know what I wanted for myself; planned on a civic for my daughter.  Anyway my salesman Rob Drury spent all day with us on 3 separate occasions, literally.  He was very patient, professional, knowledgeable and offered some very useful advice.  We ended up getting a civic and an accord and just like last time in 2014 everything went perfectly with minimal negotiation and a very fair deal. The floor manager gave us everything we wanted at the price I was willing to pay and the finance department was incredibly efficient.  I left happy and of course my daughter was thrilled. 

My wife felt left out, so less than a week later we went back to Benson Honda to get the windows tinted on both cars, and Rob Drury spent another day with us, and he was again perfect.  We test drove the CRV, and Accord, but my wife wanted to trade in her van and get the new 2016 Pilot which was has limited availability currently.  Rob was able to find us exactly what we wanted and the manager gave us the deal we wanted so we were all very pleased with the process.  After the sale Chelsea in customer relations continued to impress me by ensuring that we had everything we were promised (we had to get some options installed the next week.)  

When you go looking for a new or used car be sure you start with Benson Honda and ask for Rob Drury and find Chelsea (trust me on this one guys).  You will be glad you did and you will appreciate having them both helping you.  I almost forgot to mention Kaileigh also in customer relations who helped schedule the tinting on the civic and accord.  She was also very nice and patient with me, and helped me decide on the right tint darkness: tougher decision than you might think.  

One last thing is their brand new showroom and service dept.  Everything is so nice and new, and buying a car can take some time so it's really convenient for anyone with or without children to be able to sit comfortably with free cookies, soda and coffee while waiting.  ",5.0
59,"August 08, 2015","Visited there recently in search of a specific model of vehicle. Advertisements heard over the radio and seen online said that they would beat any price. This, however, was not the truth. After testing driving and figuring out the exact model with the exact features that we wanted we began the negotiations. Our salesmen did not seem very motivated or knowledgeable about the vehicle that we were interested in and appeared to be reluctant to help us negotiate a price, stating ""He (sales manager) would never go for that"", despite the fact that another local Honda dealership offered the EXACT SAME vehicle with the same add-ons for a lower price. Since I was in no hurry to buy I began to leave. I was stopped at the door by the salesman who was helping us and also the sales manager. Typical tag-team sales pitch. He pretended to like he was interested in meeting me closer to my desired price, however, he made no real effort. He kept going on about ""he"" payed for the window tint (that is a factory install), and ""he"" payed for the interior protectant and explained that no other Honda dealership does that (I found that most do at no extra charge).  And he kept going on and on about ""rail dust"" and how ""he"" ensured the vehicle was cleaned after arrival to the dealership (most dealerships will clean the inside and outside of the vehicle you purchase while you're completing the paperwork.

63,"June 18, 2015","Good afternoon, I tried reaching out to the Benson dealership I purchased my vehicle from, but the assistance given was not up to my standards.  I will try to give the short version of my experience.  Last Wednesday, June 10th, I purchased a used VW CC 2010 from Benson Honda.  Test drive went great, and purchase experience was fine, but what happened after is my concern.  I drove the car home and started to notice a tug on the transmission going into/out of first gear.  I would release the brake pedal and the car would jerk on it's own, non stop.  I took the car back to Benson the next day and they told me they wouldn't be able to take it a VW dealer till Friday.  I said that's fine, but I do not want to drive this vehicle, it's not safe.  A few hours later they had informed me it was taken to VW Alamo Heights.  Alamo Heights said everything checked out just fine, but to drive in sports mode to alleviate the problem.  In my mind I was thinking I shouldn't have to alter my driving experience for something I just bought 24 hours prior.  I went along with the diagnosis and tried sport mode, issue still persisted.  When I looked at the paperwork, I noticed the date and mileage were before all before my purchase date.  Benson Honda had taken in my vehicle for the SAME exact issue I was concerned with. I was informed by Benson that because VW checked out the car and said it was ok, they went ahead and deemed the car suitable to sell.  The problem I have though is Benson thought well enough to take the car in for said issue, but they were satisfied with VW saying everything was OK.  I went back to Benson with this information and I was repeatedly told to deal with VW, that it was no longer Benson's issue. I did have the used sales manager reach out to me earlier this week trying to assist me, but he offered to pay for the repairs (which were no cost thanks to extended warranty I purchased) and to give me a vehicle to drive while my car was being worked on (I already made arrangements ).  I contacted the general manager of this incident and got no reply from him.  The main issue I have is I was sold a car that knowingly had a defect.  Then when I found said defect I was told to deal with VW on my own.  The car needed a whole new computer for the transmission and I have not yet been able to drive my car.  I am hoping this message gets seen by the right individuals and handled appropriately.  ",1.8

That to me was an incompetent excuse. They offered to trade for one but it would have an additional pricing of 1200.00 dollars because of extra equipment or I could just buy the blue one for 800.00 more.Typical car salesman dishonesty. The sales person looked confused and asked another sales person what an LXS was? Considering this was a pre-determined deal it should have been an easy experience.

I wanted to say how pleased we were with Philip Rodriguez who sold us a new 2014 Honda Accord EXL last Saturday 8-16-2014. 
 
Where do you find these people? 
 
This young man made us feel very comfortable, and with his knowledge and demonstration of the car's technical superiority over the Ford Focus we were contemplating purchasing, ( Phillip didn't know we were thinking about the Ford purchase), he answered every question we had, without fault.
 
I immediately felt the difference between the two cars. There was no comparison when I was directed to the drivers seat of the Honda. 
 
I was very surprised how well the car was designed.
 
This car has more appointments on it than my 2007 Cadillac DTS, fully loaded.
 
So, I want to thank you for the pleasant experience that we had with Phillip, my wife just loves her new car. I'm very satisfied with the way we were treated, and I feel that we have found a new home.

75,"July 25, 2014","I had an alignment performed as part of some other work. When delivered, the alignment was off. Way off. Rear toe tolerance is 0.16 to 0.04. It was delivered at -0.05. Normally this would be obviously highlighted in red on the printout, but the printout was delivered in black and white. I raised the issue to the service advisor who divined that my car ""must have a bent strut for the alignment to be that far off."" What insight! He could tell from some numbers on paper in the office what his mechanic who was under the car failed to see! Or, maybe the strut is fine, but the alignment wasn't correct? Maybe the mechanic messed up? There were no ""before"" numbers provided, so that's a failure. Tire pressures weren't set correctly, so that's a failure, and I looked at the eccentric bolt on the rear control arm and there seems to be room to adjust it more in either direction, so it doesn't look maxxed out due to a bent component. It is within the realm of possibilities that a part really is bent, but shouldn't the mechanic say that? Maybe ""The rear toe is off because there's a problem with the control arm""? I did pay for an alignment, if it can't be performed it would be nice to know. Isn't that what you pay service departments to do: diagnose and repair?

84,"May 04, 2014","I spent 3+ months researching cars to make my selection. It came down to Honda, and Accord seemed to fit the bill best. 

E-mails went out to several dealers with specifications, requesting a quote. The only dealers that stayed in the game were those that answered me with the information I requested.

Phone calls came next, and I was down to 3 in San Antonio. I visited one dealership but did not have a warm feeling about my visit. The second dealership was Benson Honda. I had visited them very early on when I was just thinking about getting a new car, and I remembered that the lady with whom I had talked was friendly and helpful, but she was with a client and I was in a hurry anyway.

I heard from her again a couple of times, nothing pushy, just ""checking in."" So, I asked for her when I visited the second time, and the rest is history. Vivian Aguon immediately became my advocate for getting exactly what I wanted. We drove, we discussed, we tried everything that we thought might be a good fit for me.

Anyone who has spent any time in a dealership during the car buying experience knows that this can be a really miserable time. Not so here. Vivian was interesting and very involved in my selection process. I was impressed how hard she worked to get what I wanted. Here's the kicker - I challenge anyone to top this.

I have a nerve condition that is aggravated by anything pressing on a certain area on my backside. The bolsters on the Accord I was most interested in set the condition off, and it looked like I was going to have to scrap it. Vivian got a tape measure and measured the space between the bolsters of the car I owned at the time, and then proceeded to measure them on every car I had gone through. The 2 that 
looked like they might work were not cars I really wanted to buy. I was unhappy.

Vivian asked for me to hold on for a second, and she disappeared. When she came back she was smiling brightly and said that we were going to make the Accord work for me. She and the GSM, Noah Caballero, contacted a shop that does interior work for the dealership and verified that the seats could, in fact, be modified. She took me to the shop so I could see what they did there, and I was on board.

Rather making this long story longer, here it is:
I own that Accord. The seat bolsters are entirely flat (nirvana for me). I have everything I wanted in the car. And best of all, I feel great about my experience at Benson. I would never have thought someone would try so hard and think so far out of the box to make the difference between getting a car I did not like or making the car I liked fit my lifestyle.

After my experience with Vivian, I did not need to see any more dealers. Benson got my business, because Vivian knows her business. The best relationship with a dealer and its people ever!

I drove from Houston to purchase one of the last new 2013 Honda Pilots in the state and Benson had an EX-L for under $33K, so I called them and decided to visit them. I figured the trip would be worth it if I could reduce the price for a new pilot since they prices are a little inflated.I made them aware of the amount I wanted to finance with TTL. I verified all information over the phone and spoke to Vivian over 5 times since they confirmed the appointment and assured me that it would. I drove 200+ miles and after arriving, Vivian passed me on to another sales person, who I had not talked to before. Also, they don't have any open areas to have a confirmation so we had to sit in another sales person desk that was covered in pink and fluffy ornaments all over. After taking down the information and getting the car for test drive, I find that the car has 700+ miles on odometer, which was not great, but I figured the price would surely come down. When they brought the first offer to me, I was floored to find out that they wanted me to finance over $36K. After reviewing it, I noticed the trade in was paid in full, so the only two other items was the sales price and $750 cash back from dealer. The sales price was $35K, so I told sales rep that the website had a price under $33K and I was expecting not to pay even that given the 700 miles on the car. The sales manager then approached me and said that the price on their website was the price with no dealer installed items, which brought up the price to $36K and that the $35K was a $1,000 discount. I told him that I did not care for the items and could be taken off since I did not care for the window and hood additions. He said they would not come off and that that was the best price. I told him that even with the options, this car was going for way more than 2014 models and 700 less miles, but he would not budge. I called Gunn Honda and went there so that my trip would not be in vain. I purchased a 2014 EX Pilot for under $30K, I also priced a 2014 EX-L with less that 10 miles and it was under $33K, which had dealer installed items also, but still less than Benson. Bait and switch tactic was deplorable given my long trip, the facilities are below par, and the incompetence and greed of sales team was just as bad. Gunn Honda had great service, staff, facilities, and car availability with no dealer installed items. ",1.6

I basically walked around with my aging mother for 35 minutes before walking in and waiting another 10 minutes for a sales person. The store was NOT busy. Julio was very helpful and was with a customer at the time but said he would also help us. All I wanted was a basic Civic new for my mother. I had a price quote from Benson and after we were shown the one she wanted we got a price of 2300.00 more than what was quoted! Julio said it was because of the additional accessories. The prices for things we didn't need were ridiculous. 499.00 for a pinstripe and 499.00 tint didn't make sense. 1200.00 for a spoiler! I mean who are they kidding. I asked to speak to a manager, Chuck who was condescending and completely clueless tried to claim everyone charges the same and it's set pricing. That's funny coming form a dealership that says they negotiate. I showed him the pricing I was quoted directly from them and he just laughed and said ""we gotta get you here somehow"". Wow! So lying to a customer and having them drive all the way in under false pretenses is their practice of doing business. Whatever happened to being honest?

http://www.dealerrater.com/dealer/Benson-Honda-review-1610/. After I read NavaidRafiq's complaints, everything starts to make a sense. I can see a pattern there. What is described there must be a tactic to deal with their customer. In a very clever and confusing way, the total cost will be more than MSRP at the end. I guarantee you that you don't even notice it if you are not careful. A finance manager won't answer to your questions clearly either. I was lucky since my wife caught that because monthly payment is little higher before actually sign on the final documents. Somehow, my trade-in price wasn't applied and hidden into unorganized handwritten document. Even after we caught this, they still try to deal more. I understand that a deal can go bad, but their attitude makes me really mad.
And, the situation was getting worse since they misplaced my car keys for the trade-in. I am not sure how other people can see this place with professional sales people. They would be look better in a flea market. After hours of tormenting, we were sitting there another hour until they return my key back. Although, they offered us a ride, but we refused it. What are we going to do next day without a car? When my wife refused the ride, the sales person we dealt with jumped on us right away. He said, ""my car is $19,000 one, what's wrong with that?"" Probably, you can understand what it means without my explanation. If you want to go to Benson, you need to bring at least $19,000 worth of trade-in.... I understand he would be frustrated since he failed to close the deal, but I don't think he has a right to say so. He is the one who failed to calculate the cost correctly and messed up the deal. More clearly, missing keys is really a stupid mistake can't be happen in a dealership like this. But, they don't seem to be sorry at all. I even heard some sales people said 'bad day!' They were cursing at us... speechless! They don't even have a key box to keep their customers' keys! All I just wanted was to get out of there as soon as possible. But, they will hold you there as long as they possibly can either intentionally or not.

102,"November 07, 2013","My husband and I had the pleasure of working with Aaron Salazar. When we first walked in to the sales floor, we were not greeted by a single salesman, and we were quite shocked, so we stopped and started looking into a car that was on display when Aaron approached us and asked if we had been helped. We answered immediately that we had not and he directed us to a desk and asked what we were needing. He was very knowledgable, professional, patient, and respectful. I am very picky and demanding when it comes to picking a new vehicle, well in everything we purchase, and he met our every need and helped in every way he could in the most respectful way. He even stayed two hours later after they had closed because he was willing to meet our expectations and go out of his way to help us. We have now had our vehicle for two months now, and he followed up with us recently to see how our new vehicle is doing and how we like it, and also has gone out of his way to continue to help us. I could not have been more happy and pleased. I highly recommend having him as your go-to when you purchase a new vehicle. He made us feel like close friends that he wanted to take care of instead of ""commission"". He deserves the highest praises for his hard work! Thank you again for everything Aaron! Benson should be honored to have a great person working and representing their company! ",5.0

I would like to report a terrible experience with David Nelson in finance. When my fiancé and I went into Benson Honda on 10/9 (Wednesday) to purchase a vehicle we had a vehicle buyers check from Randolf Brooks Federal Credit Union to pay for the car out right. We found the car we wanted at the right price and had a wonderful experience with the salesman. It turned out to be a different story in the finance office. David insisted that we listen to how he could offer us a much better interest rate and warranty than RBFCU ever could. We told him that we were happy with our current interest rate that we already obtained and we had been satisfied customers with RBFCU for years. Another huge issue we had is that we didn’t want more hard pulls on our credit reports. With some coxing he said he could drop a point off of our already offered interest rate by putting us with Wells Fargo. He said we were approved through RBFCU so Wells Fargo would definitely finance us with no problem. So, ignorantly trusting, we signed the papers to set the deal in motion. Unfortunately I failed to notice a pre-checked box with the words “assigned without recourse”. David never mentioned that if Wells Fargo didn’t accept us, then he could legally do more hard pulls until he found someone who would finance us.  And that’s exactly what happened, even after we explicitly stated we were only ok with one more pull to see if we could find a better interest rate. We take the car home under the impression that we would be financed through Wells Fargo, which is what David told us as we shook hands and left his office on 10/9 (Wednesday). A few days pass and I get repeated phone calls while I’m at work, sometimes just a single ring from a (210) 341-1356. On 10/10 (Thursday) I receive a call/voicemail from Ryan our salesman, politely asking us how the car was and informing us that our mats and trunk tray were available for pick up at the dealership. We go in that afternoon and pick up our mats and nothing was mentioned about a problem with financing. After that day I received one call on 10/11 (Friday), one on 10/14 (Monday), one on 10/15 (Tuesday), one on 10/16 (Wednesday), one on one on 10/18 (Friday). I was able to answer the call on the 18th (because I happened to be off work before the finance office apparently closed for the day) and it was David told me my social security number was flagged and I needed a paper verifying that my name did indeed belong to my social security number.  Wells Fargo accepted us, but was just waiting on verification of my SSN. I was pretty upset that he didn’t bother to leave me a voicemail earlier to tell me what was going on. I was angry and wouldn’t have the chance to go down to the SS office until Wednesday morning. I asked for his email because I find it easier to correspond that way since I work two jobs and have odd hours. I emailed him stating how incredibly upset I was at the inconvenience and that due to my work schedule he’d have to wait until 10/23 (Wednesday) for the paper. I check the mail on 10/14 (Monday) and find a letter from SACU stating we were denied an auto loan. Frustrated and confused I check my Credit Karma and my fiancé checks his and we find multiple pulls from Wells Fargo on 10/10 (Thursday) and Chase on 10/14 (Monday). Furious, I head over to Benson Honda after work on 10/21 (Monday) to find out what’s going on.  The story, according to David, is that on 10/10 (Thursday), the day after we took the car home, David’s boss and head of the financing department, waltzed into the office and saw we were pending approval from Wells Fargo and took the liberty of running our credit again with two other financial institutions to find one that would accept us without needing proof of my identification. And he did it all without David’s knowledge. Well, first David told me he wasn’t sure who was responsible for re-running our credit, and then he told me he was pretty sure it was his boss, and then the final story was his boss was ultimately responsible. I expressed my dissatisfaction with the lack of communication, but David didn’t seem apologetic or offer to bring his boss in for an explanation of the events. He was rude, interrupted me, and was overly aggressive when talking to me.  I left Benson Honda baffled and horribly upset at how everything I was trying to avoid during the process had ended up happening after all.  If I had the chance I would take the car back and call all debts even, but unfortunately the world doesn’t work like that. I will NEVER buy from Benson Honda again, nor will I refer friends or family to them.  My fiancé has been getting his car serviced there for years, but will no longer be taking his civic there for oil changes or maintenance of any kind.  I would like to personally speak to the General Manager and Finance Manager about this. To at least find out what really happened and not have to listen to the c*** that David threw at me the last time I was in his office.

Fifty percent of my service experiences have been totally unacceptable. My dissatisfaction ranges from poor service from the shuttle driver to excessive repair time ( minor service) with an appointment, to out right poor advisement and absolutely no appreciation for a customers time.

126,"July 27, 2013","My experience with Benson Honda was terrible.

Complaints

1) The saleswoman I dealt with was not friendly. If you are going to try to sell me a product, use small talk, be nice, and courteous. She spent the entire time walking around while I was sitting in a cubical. You think a car salesman of any trade would know how to sell their product.
2) I was offered MSRP for the car($22,265). It was a brand new 2013 civic EX-L. I then told her that I had been quoted the E-price for the car, which was approximately $20,600. After waiting a long time, she came back and offered me $21,700ish, which included the already installed tinted windows and the Honda Destination fee. Why aren't these fees included in the E-Price.
3) Before she gave me an offer on the car, I asked if there were graduation discounts like other dealerships offer. She said they were already applied, but she still offered me the MSRP. AKA she lied.
4) When she came back with a payment, it was $479. I'm not stupid enough to be sold a payment. The interest rate on that payment was 12%. I'm a finance major and have masters in banking. I complained about the payment, and it was lowered to $399. I told her i was looking for about $350, which is roughly a 3% rate.
5) The only debt I have is credit card debt. Everything else is money in my pocket. I work in lending for a financial institution. I understand how underwriting works. I have sufficient income to pay the loan. My debt to income isn't high at all. I also have a credit score of 734.
6) I asked her who they check their rates with. She said ""Chase, Wells Fargo, aka the big banks"". Since I work for a financial institution, I know that Chase and Well Fargo do not care about consumer lending. That isn't their target market. The target market of consumer lending is credit unions. I mentioned Randolph Brooks and Security Service, and she played it off by saying they check their rates too and insured I would get the lowest rate possible.
7) I never agreed to the $399 payment. The saleswoman assured me it would go down. I wanted the loan over 6 years.
8) I talked to the finance guy and he told me my interest rate was roughly 4.5% through Honda. When i asked him about a credit union, he said that i'd probably get 3.5% for 6 years, but I shouldn't do that because Honda gives you a $500 rebate, and I'd actually save money by financing through them.
9) That guy had no idea what he was talking about. The different in 3.5% and 4.5% throughout the life of the loan is $1,000, so they would make an extra $500 off of me. Also, I was lied to by the saleswoman saying that they check the credit unions. She did not try to get me the lowest rate possible like she promised.
10) To this day, I have no idea how i was quoted 4.5%. The payment of $399 is a little bit over 7% interest. The actual payment of 4.5% is $365.
11) I ended up walking out and will never do business with them. They are a bunch of scam artist who pray on people who don't know what they are doing.

Moral of the story, don't go here. Also, always bring a financial calculator and ask about the hidden fees. Check their math on the interest rate/terms and make sure it's right. They just try to screw you over. Don't believe what they tell you because they get paid to lie.",1.2

129,"June 16, 2013","Received a letter ""guaranteeing"" they could get me out of my current high interest loan since I had been making timely payments. I went in close to closing time. I asked if they were closing I could come back some other time. A manager came out and said to just wait for a moment and he could page a salesperson. After waiting for 20 minutes a salesman finely comes out and catches me right before I am almost in my car and getting ready to leave. We looked at some Honda Civics that I liked. After waiting for almost 30 minutes, come to find out that all the keys to the cars that we wanted to test drive were all signed out. How can all the keys be signed out to almost 4 vehicles and we are the only customers at the dealership. It doesn't end there. I said I could do without the test drive that I was just ready to see what they had to offer. Well after picking out the car and the salesman taking my info he takes it to his manager then comes back with a ridiculous offer. The letter said they could get me into a new or certified used vehicle with little or no money down, with payments at or below my current payments and that they would ""Guarantee"" a new or used upgrade regardless of who had financed my vehicle previously. Well the offer they brought back was for a $2000 down payment and a payment of $629/month for a Honda Civic that had a retail value of $22,999. First of all I don't know there definition of little or no money down but to me $2000 is not a little amount. Secondly the $629/month payment was way off of my current payment of $337/month that they had promised in there letter that they could keep me at the same or lower monthly payment. The managers working out my deal were not friendly at all. One of the managers would not even look at me in my face and after I would not budge on the numbers just walked away and said ""it is not going to happen"". The salesman assigned to us was very professional but the managers were very rude. I don't know who they think they are but they need to be careful who they are dealing with. I am retired army and still have close ties to close friends that are both retired and active duty in San Antonio. I will not recommend this dealership to any of them nor will I ever come back there. I hope that the managers and whomever is running this place take a close look at who is working for them. I know a little bit about management since I spent 20 plus years of active duty with a tour in Iraq.

Within a few minutes I received the lowest price for the 2013 Honda Cross Tour that I felt comfortable with.  I printed my USAA Car Buying Certificate along with the pre-aproved Electronic Check and drove up to the dealer.
Upon arrival I was met by Mr. Aaron Salazar (Sales Consultant) who took me to their new cars lot located just 1/2 mile from the dealership and  showed me three cars, I test drove them and decided to go for the Cross Tour after his professional attitude and knowledge of each vehicle convinced me I have made the right decision.  Through life I have purchased cars and this time has been the most rewarding one due to Mr. Salazar's positive attitude and willing to go the extra mile for me.  Although the Benson Dealership has many professional Consultants I can only strongly recommend Mr. Salazar, it was a pleasant experience having him as my consultant.  The next phase was seeing Ms. Kimberly Roland (Finance Manager), it was almost 8:00 PM, Saturday night and she took care of me as if I was her first customer of the day, very friendly, great smile, professional and answered all my questions related to my purchase order and vehicle registration/plates.

One salesman came up to us without a smile or even introducing himself to us to ask us what we needed. We asked where the used Honda Accords were and he just said ""up there"", basically not making an effort to try to show us where. As I was asking him questions, he was just very rude and seemed bothered that I was asking him questions. Never once did I see this man smile. I asked him about certain Accords that I saw online and he didn't seem like he knew where any of them were. He finally went inside to figure out where his inventory was. He came back and just said ""we sold it"" or that they weren't there. He asked me if I wanted to see a white Accord and I told him I wasn't interested in that color. He then asked me if I wanted to see other cars that they had on another lot so I agreed. We then went to the other lot and looked around. I saw one that I was interested in but it did not have a price. I asked him what the price was and he said "" I don't know somewhere in the thousands"" Okay. So I asked him again and he snapped at me saying that he needed to know first if I liked it because he did not want to waste his time showing me a car I did not like. I was offended when he said that and we just decided to leave. I will not tolerate someone being rude to me when I am going to be making a very big purchase.

He answered all of our questions and more importantly to me, he treated me with respect and professionalism.  As a 40-something yr. old female who has bought all of her own vehicles, it is a bit of a sore spot when a sales person ignores me in favor of the man accompanying me or presents a vehicle based on the cosmetic, superficial aspects such as mirrors and cup holders.  After my test drive and final decision, I shopped dealerships looking for the best deal.  Benson, through Jay, came back with the best deal by far.  They were also the only dealership to go after and procure the EXACT vehicle I wanted.  I will definately recommend Benson Honda and Jay Conley for his professionalism and customer service.",5.0

138,"March 22, 2013","My salesperson was Jay Conley. I was very impressed by Jay's professionalism. My employment involves initiation of new business relationships, reviewing current relationships and the forensic review of prior relationships. I have found that most problems in business relationships begin before any documents are signed. Jay did what I train employees to do. 1) make sure you understand what the other party wants and epects 2) know what is is negotiable and what is not 3) clearly communicate what is possible and what is not, ASAP. 4) work in earnest to make the sure other party is satisfied before signatures are exchanged.  

Jay took the time to understand the transaction I wanted. He accepted what I delcared as non-negotiable and provided me immediate feedback on what was possible and what was not. I have the wherewithal to do the deal I want, where and when I want. I chose Benson Honda because Jay Conley was the professional he was.   

4-03-13 This matter is beyond the control of the sale staff but affects my business relationship with Benson Honda. Benson Honda failed to remit funds owed me in a timely. I agreed to a rather long period of 10 days to receive a check from the sale of a vehicle to the dealership. Seventeen days after the sale, I still don't have the check. No calls from the department responsible for payment. No more business from me. I get my check and license plate and we are done. Best wishes in your future relations.   JWI",5.0

146,"July 17, 2012","DON'T BUY ANYTHING FROM THESE SCAM ARTISTS!!!

I went in and bought a car last Thursday (or at least I thought I did...) They called me Saturday and asked me to come in and sign some new paperwork for my loan.  I didn't necessarily mind this, b/c the lady I did my paperwork with told me that if they received a better offer than what we had agreed to (and we both signed all loan paperwork agreeing to)they would go with the one that was less.  Needless to say, I thought my loan rate was going down, so I showed up to sign.  When I showed up, the guy doing my paperwork tried to slip my loan agreement in front of me to sign it quickly.  Fortunately, I read it!  They raised my interest rate AND added more months to my payoff!!!! On top of that, my payments went up!!!  Of course I refused to sign that deal, and the guy told me he would have to look in to it the next day (today).  

I received a call today from the original person I did financing with there and she was EXTREMELY short with me (like I was the idiot who screwed up) and had no problem lying to me and telling me I got a better deal...  

I've NEVER bought a car and got a call from the dealership saying the interest rate went up AFTER I signed all the paperwork with them! I wouldn't have bought the car at that monthly payment!  The funny thing is that I have the paperwork that both her and I signed which has all rates we agreed on! 

I guess Benson Honda has no problem trying to renege on even their SIGNED agreements...  

STAY AWAY!!!

148,"May 11, 2012","Mike and Jeff didn’t listen to what my needs were, they lied to me and my bank, and repeatedly used bullying and intimidation to try to force me to complete the transaction. When that didn’t work Mike tried to put hands on me.  I will never deal with Benson Honda again and am telling all of my friends and coworkers this story.  

I started my communication with Benson Honda on 5/4.  I explained that my husband and I both had health issues, and that I would like to negotiate as much as possible over e-mail so that our visit to the dealership could be as quick as possible. I also explained that I had secured some financing on my own but I had completed the Benson Honda application as well.

After being contacted by several people that didn’t contact me back, I started communicating with Mike Cuellar and Jeff Bouchard. Jeff was wholly unhelpful when addressing the issues and accommodations that Honda and the county provide for disabled customers.  I would provide him with the information and his response was always to defer me to someone else and ask when I would sign the papers.  It was during this time that Mike started calling me on the phone.  

During these phone calls I explained the accommodations that I needed, discussed the amount that was going to be payed on my trade in, discussed financing, and the total price of the entire transaction.  This culminated in my husband’s physician faxing documentation for his handicapped plates and Mike faxing an invoice to my bank detailing that the entire transaction was going to have a total of $27,494.26, including negative equity that I was rolling into the new loan.  On 05/8 Mike got aggressive with me and tried to bully me into signing paperwork committing to buying the vehicle before I’d gotten approval from the lender.  On 5/9 Jeff did the same thing asking when I was going to “finalize this damn transaction”.  I explained to them both that I was not signing anything until the lender was satisfied with the documentation and the loan was approved.

For some reason, Mike could not fax an invoice with all of the correct information my bank was requiring, so I took off work early to go to the dealership on 5/10 to attempt to complete the transaction.

As soon as I arrived at the dealership I was shuttled into Mr Cuellar’s office and my car keys were taken.  My husband and I waited for 30 minutes without any communication until Jeff came in with a bunch of papers and started spewing lies.  He said that no one had committed to the 27k number, nor had anyone committed to giving me $10,000 on my trade.  I could not provide validation of these claims because Mr. Cuellar had told me all of these things verbally and I  hadn’t gotten a copy of the invoice from the bank faxed to me.  The crux of that conversation was that they were raising the price of the transaction to $32,000.  That included an enforced requirement to purchase a 7 year extended warranty for $3,000 and GAP insurance for another $1,000.  When I explained that was unacceptable, they shuffled off to the back office for another 30 minutes while I snatched my car keys off of the desk.  

I was then escorted to the back office where they attempting to convince me that charging me 5,000 more and extending the payment term wasn’t a big deal because it would only raise my payment by almost $70 per month.  I explained that this was not the deal that I was promised on the phone and that I wasn’t purchasing and putting an extended warranty into a loan when I could purchase the very same thing any time before the original warranty expired without having to pay interest on it.  Jeff would not budge. I had to purchase the warranty and the GAP insurance or he was not going to sell me the car.

I stepped outside to discuss the offer with my husband and realized how awful this offer was.  In the end it was $200 more than our existing car payment.  We decided against the loan and I returned to the showroom to decline the offer officially rather than just sneaking out.  I saw Mike first, and when I politely told him that I was not going to buy the car, he freaked out, called me names and started hollering about how he’d spend days on this loan and demanded to know why I was leaving. I explained that the terms of the loan had changed several times, weren’t what my bank had agreed to, and the additional payments weren’t worth it to us.  Mike attempted to take me by the arm and walk me back into the back and I stepped away to keep him from grabbing me.  He then said that we had to discuss this with his manager before I would be allowed to leave.  I explained that as an adult, I can leave whenever I wanted and that I’d already retrieved my keys from his desk.  He was screaming something about my not being willing to work with them as I left the showroom.  ",1.2
149,"April 18, 2012","I enjoyed working with Phil through the buying process. The car we purchased was actually ordered for us as the dealership did not have any CR-V EX models with AWD available. We contracted on the vehicle on 3/31/2012 and did not receive the vehicle until 4/17/2012. Phil, however, tried his best to make sure that we were OK and updated throughout the waiting process. He gave us a loaner to drive in while waiting and called at least once a week to tell us what was going on. Once we were ready to pick up the car he made sure to have everything ready to go including our accessories that we ordered. He also took time to help us set up our bluetooth with our phones and made sure to explain all of the features of the screen to us before leaving the dealership. He took the time to explain pretty much everything and we appreciated it. I would definitely recommend him to friends and family. He made the process easy and worth the wait.  ",4.2
150,"April 14, 2012","I got a letter from this dealership saying that because I was paying my car on time each month I had the opportunity to trade it for a new one or refinance to get my Apr as low as 3.99%. So  after talking 3 times on the phone with a lady representing the company and assuring that they I was gonna get another car for the same price or lower and possibly a new one, or maibe refinance to save up to $80 on my bill each month so I decided to go. It took an hour and 25 minutes to get there, so after talking to the sales man and taking all my information he ask me what I want my monthly payment to be and I told him the same or lower maibe $20 more if I really like it but no more, so they bring a new Honda civic and say that I qualify for that one so we took it for a ride, and I really liked it it was nice but I knew it was too expensive for me. I knew that I problably was gonna need to get a used car of around $12000 to keep my payment the same. So we went back to the office and he says that thy can take my car for $5000 plus I have to pay a down payment of 3000 dollars and the payment its gonna go up about $150 a month, so I said it was too much for us and we probably be better off refinancing, so he lost all interest in me and just left to talk to his boss, he didn't try to show me a cheaper car or any more options. After a long wait he comes back and tells me that the can refinance my car and have the payment go from $231 to $217 a month so its $14 that I be saving a month and about $160 a year, so I was a little dissapointed but at least it was something. So I asked the guy how much did my Apr go he said it staid the same, and I ask how is it possible to lower my payment without lowering my Apr  and he didn't had any answers he said I had to talk to the finance guy. So when I got to him that was the first question I asked and he said that since I'm starting a new loan that's why but it didn't make sense to me, so I asked when its my last payment and he said 5 years from today, so I said I had paid my car for a year and two months now why would I pay for an extra year just to save $14 a month that is ridiculous and I'm gonna end up paying way more than what I'm paying now. He said that since I'm starting a new loan at the end of it my Apr would go lower, no thanks they made me waist 3 hours there plus an hour and a half drive for nothing this was such a waste of time and I'm really mad at this company they were trying to rip me off but I catch them on time, so be careful with this people or better yet just stay away!",1.0
151,"April 10, 2012","My daughter recently bought a ""certified"" pre-owned car from Benson.  It was my understanding that ""certified"" meant it had been thoroughly inspected, repaired and you shouldn't have any problems in the near future.  It didn't take but about amonth before she started having issues with the brakes squealing and the car stuttering when accelerating. She tried to have it repaired but was having difficulty arranging a time to take her car to the shop as she is a single parent and has to work long hours.  When she tried to make another appointment she was told that her ""warranty"" had expired and her issues were her own problem.

She took the car to a different dealer who basically told her that she should not be having these types of issues with a ""certified"" car but they could not help her and told her she needed to take the car back to Benson.

I have tried to call the manager of the pre-owned department twice and have had to leave voice mails both times.  The first time he was on another line and the second he was in a meeting.  I have yet to receive a return phone call from him.

Evidently Benson believes in the philosophy of once you buy a car they don't care.  I am concerned as my daughter traded in an almost new Civic for an older model because she needed a 4-door sedan with the new baby.  What happens if she breaks down with the baby in the car?  It becomes obvious that the term ""certified"" simply means ""we're going to charge you more for the car because you think you're getting a car that is mechanically sound and reliable but in reality we don't care.""",2.6

157,"March 01, 2012","After purchasing our 2012 Honda Oddysey, the dealership gave us a 3.5 Interest rate, and we purchased the extended warranty.  However, I returned two weeks later and completed the extended warranty cancellation paperwork. The finance manager, Lori Solis, told me to give the secretary the cancellation paperwork.  I asked for a copy, but she told me she could not make me one.  I returned a few days later and could not get any help in getting a copy, because the secretary was not there.  About a month later, on or about 15 Feb, my wife and I returend to get to see if we could get a copy of the paperwork, and found out that it was missing and was never submitted.  Finally we got with Chris Gans, and he took the time to help us complet a new cancellation form and submitted it.  We are still waiting the 4-6 weeks to pass, to see if the cancellation is in affect.  Another thing is don't believe the sales person nor the ticket price on the vehicle, they told us that they were having a special,and we, after lowering the price about $2000., still ended overpaying a few thousands over the sticker price, after it was all said an done.  Try to get your finance done through a bank,right now they have lower interests thatn the dealership.   

I've notice how everyone is helpful when you first show up to look, and purchase a vehicle here, but afterwards, they most representatives ignore you, as if you have no need to be there.  Its like a fish, when it sees the first bait it attacks, but after is has already eaten there is no interest. From what I have seen in the past two vehicles that I have purchased, thats nothing new with most dealerships; but they surely rave about customer satisfaction.  Not sure that if I purchase another Honda, it will be at this dealership. I'll probably go to Austin and see if I get a better deal and hopefully find a place that has the best interes for the customer.",3.0

188,"November 04, 2011","Horrible experience and very unprofessional.  The salesman was good and worked with us somewhat.  But, it was obvious either he or the manager was looking to make their monthly salary off of us.  My horror with Benson was not as bad as others but I went there to buy a new Honda Accord. You expect to do the back and forth when it comes to price but it was obvious the dealership wanted to make as much money off of me as possible without giving me a square deal. I pointed out the prices at Gunn Honda were much cheaper so they made an effort to match the prices at Gunn. I had my eye on a 2011 V6 Demo on the show room floor but was going to pay the same price for the demo as the 2012...(I must point out the first time I went to the dealership to see it as advertised on their website it was gone...the general manager was driving it and and I would have to return another day to see it). After the back and forth they dropped the price to be a whopping 1000 dollars under the 2012...not worth it. The salesman went back and the general manager is yelling, and I do mean yelling, at the salesman saying, &quot;Tell him No! I don't have time for this!&quot;. The general manager then slams the so called invoice in front of the salesman. When the salesman returns the general manager has lowered the price a whopping 500 dollars (this made it 1k off of the 2012). I pointed out to the salesman the manager seemed upset to which the salesman stated he has gotten use to it. To ensure Mr. Tom Benson doesn't think this guy is the best, I took my business elsewhere and purchased the same car at another lot. The manager of that lot is the most unprofessional person I have come into contact with. Simply worthless and he does not respect his sales staff, whom he works with daily, and he definately does not respect the customers. The sad part of this story is I figured they would only come down a little bit more and I was willing to pay it and I would have bought that car that night. However, that temper tantrum was a turn off and I will be dog gone if I will give Benson my money when he employs a bi-polar manager. Mr. Benson, I wonder how many people this manager has ran off? This may have appeared to be a sales tactic but I felt personally disprected and offended by his behavior. You may not care about my feelings but as I said before, I do not think this is the first time he has done this. I encourage the Benson Honda sales staff to continue to add reviews to keep the ratings up as this is the only way they will not have an overall 1 star rating. Our sales person Richard was good. he tried hard to seal the deal as is expected by a salesman. He appeared to be knowledgeable as well. If I was rating this based on Richard alone there would be many more stars...however, the leader of this place needs to be fired. Funny how another person had a situtation where he callse the manager &quot;Unprofessional&quot;...may not just be me...Mr. Benson, FIRE THAT GUY! Heck, he is running up miles on your cars that could be sold!  I do not know the managers name and really do not care to to know his name but he was working on 31 Oct 11 in the evening and he sat in the corner office.  I do not think he had a mustace but he did have a beard.

191,"October 07, 2011","I recently took my vehicle into Benson Honda for an oil leak.  The same day, they call me back and say there is no leak, the drain plug just needed to be tightened.  I explained to them that I checked that already and the leak was coming from elsewhere.  They insisted that my vehicle was “fixed”.  A few days later, oil is still leaking on my driveway so I look under it and it is filled with oil again.  I take it back and they have it for 3 days then call me and tell me that it’s the oil pan gasket.  I insist that it is coming from a different place so they replace the oil pan gasket and check for leaks and find a leak from the rear main seal.  So they have to drop my transmission to fix it and now take about another 4 days to get that fixed.  My wife goes to pick it up and when she brings the vehicle home, I notice it covered with scratches, dings, my rear bumper was messed up and creased from being backed into something and front bumper was scraped as well and a bunch of mismatched touchup paint trying to cover up spots on it that they had put there.  Not to mention that my vehicle now had about 90 miles added to it.  I called them back and my wife took it back in and then Richard “service director” was being real rude with my wife and telling her that there is no way that they did any of that and pretty much telling her that she was making it all up.  She then told them to check the paperwork and see if there was damage on it when we brought it in.  Richard then went in and checked and came out and said they would fix the damages.  I go today to pick it up and some of the scratches are out but there are still dings and a lot of touchup paint on my vehicle.  That is not the way I brought my vehicle in to them!  I then tried to talk to Craig Davis (supposedly runs the place) and he denied to speak to me about the incident telling one of his workers to tell me that he was too busy to deal with that.  That is totally UNPROFESSIONAL!  If there is a matter of this sort, you talk to the customer to try and fix it!  I then talked to Richard again and he stated there was nothing he could do and he doesn’t believe that any of his workers did the damage to the vehicle.  I asked him about the mileage on the truck and he said that they have to test drive it to make sure it works properly and I then said what if the damages happened while they were test driving the vehicle and he said that impossible because they don’t drive that far.  He contradicted himself by saying the miles on the car are from the test drive but they don’t drive that far.  Me and my wife have been loyal customers of Benson since 2004 and have purchased numerous cars and had many family members purchase vehicles from here, but I can honestly say that we will NEVER return to this dealership again!  Not even to change the oil on our vehicles!  My level of trust has gone out the window with these people!  If I were you, I would stay away from this place!",1.0

194,"August 21, 2011","Issue number 1:
my battery died in August of 2011 so I of course called Benson to get a replacement.  It was replaced previously while under the Honda bumper to bumper warranty.  When it died the second time Benson refused to replace the battery.  The battery was installed in 10/2008 and died 8/2011.  The battery (factory) states it has a 36 month replacement but since the battery was replaced under warranty that warranty no longer applies.  Thanks guys really appreciate you looking out for your customers.
Issue number 2:
I am driving by the dealership on Saturday, service light had gone off while shopping.  Pull up and sit in the express lane for 5 minutes.  No one stops to ask me anything, very odd usually have service department guys swarming me when I pull up.  I walk in the express service department and ask for an oil change from one of the gentlemen behind the counter.  I immediately get a shake of the head stating that they are no longer taking any oil changes for the day.  Although its 15 min before close when I finally walked inside I was rather surprised by his response.  I was even told they would not have taken any more oil changes after 2:30, an hour and a half before they close.  So once again I had to go somewhere else to get my car serviced.  Interesting that I can pull up to a jiffy lube and get my car serviced and cleaned in under 10min.

I bought by Honda new in 2006 and have had it serviced at Benson ever since.  Unfortunately my experiences over the past month has been enough to make me move on.  I would think they would value the customer experience at this dealership as they had in the past but apparently that is no longer the case.  I am glad there are other Honda dealerships in town that are willing to take my money.

195,"July 17, 2011","I first traveled from my home just outside Austin down to San Antonio to buy a Honda from Benson Honda back in 1988.  I had a very good experience then, and when we recently were shopping for a new Honda, I requested a price quote from them again. I also requested quotes from all the Honda dealers in Austin, Temple, San Marcos, and San Antonio. Andy Irizarry, sales mgr. at Benson, had exactly the car I wanted and he also quoted me the best price of all the dealers.  Beyond that, while many of the dealers bombarded me with ""form"" e-mails that made it clear no one had even read what I was writing to them, or knew what I was looking for, Andy's communications were personal and specific to my needs.

We made the trip down and bought the 2011 CR-V from Benson.  Salesman Mike Cuellar handled all the leg work, and was friendly and knowledgeable.  The whole process moved quickly and efficiently.  Andy was on site all afternoon, and was available if we needed him.  We drove home that afternoon in our new CR-V, having paid exactly the price Andy quoted us by e-mail at the beginning.

This was an excellent, no hassle and best price car buying experience.  I gladly recommend Andy, Mike, and Benson Honda.

I took it back to Benson, and they said I needed a new seal on the master cylinder. Since I had so recently purchased the car from them, I asked them for a discount off the almost $500 dollar repair bill. Cliff, the sales manager, flatly refused to give me a discount, saying ""You bought the car as is"". However, when my boyfriend spoke with him, he came away with a discount of about 15%. I think this is discriminatory and prejudicial against me, a woman and Hispana. Cliff thought he could just talk like that to me and get away with it.

201,"May 27, 2011","I recently bought a 2011 Oddysy, and had a problem with the tailgate.  I should have taken it to where I bought it (Benson), but instead I took it to the dealer closest to where I live.  I had made a Saturday appointment for 9:00am, but when I arrived, they had no record of it.  I waited there for nearly 8 hours before they finally told me that they would have to order a part.  I was not happy at all, but all I could do was schedule another appointment for the following Saturday.  When I arrive at 7:30am the next Saturday for an 8:00am appointment, they told me that the computers were down, so they wouldn't be able to check me in, tell me if the part was in, or even begin to look at the repair.  They suggested I wait until the system came back up.  They said I could leave it with them until the following Monday, but that they couldn't guarantee it would be ready then.  I live about 30 minutes away from this dealer, so I asked if I could get a loaner or a rental since this was their mistake.  They refused, so I told them that I would just have to go to another dealer.  They told me that since the repair was under warranty, and I had started the claim with them, I would not be able to transfer the service to any other dealer.  So, I sat back down and waited.  At noon, there was no progress to get the system back up, and no attempt as far as I could tell.  I finally left fuming, and called Benson.

Then I called Benson and talked to Cory.  I explained what the other dealer had put me through, and he said he thought he could take care of the problem.  He just asked me to fax him a copy of the report from the other dealer.  He called me back within a few days to tell me that he would take care of getting the part transferred from the other dealer to Benson.  He scheduled the repair for the following Saturday at 8:00am.  When I arrived, Cory immediately came out to get the keys from me.  Judging from the large number of people that were already in the waiting room when I arrived, I figured I was in for a long wait.  I was completely wrong, though.  Everyone that was already there, including me, was out the door in under 2 hours.  Everyone there seemed to know what they were doing and were gettin gthings done.

Thirty-one minutes later, a tech walks in, hands me a $0.00 receipt, let me know they had replaced my battery, thanked me, handed me my keys and showed me to my car.  Awesom.",5.0
281,"May 26, 2010","I have been using Benson Honda Service for 10-12 years.  I have always found them to be fair,courtesy, professional and ""do what they say they will"".  The service this time for for my 2005 Honda Odyssey Van. The van had 100,000 miles, and I needed to replace the timing belt.  I visited Honda service prior to the work for a quote and information related to this service.  My contact was Richard De La O.  He quoted me the price, explained the procedure, and time required.  Richard also gave me a $100 discount coupon for timing belt replacement.  We set the appointment and the work was done satisfactory at the price, and time required. This was another example of the professionalism that I have experienced every time I have visited Benson Honda.   ",5.0
282,"May 25, 2010","If I were able to rate my experience at Benson Honda, my reviews would be higher than a score of 5 for all the questions asked above!! I've taken my vehicle to this location in the past and have been completely satisfied each time! I do have to admit that this last time was way beyond my expectations and because of that I will never send my Honda to another dealership for service!!  Keep up the good work Benson!",5.0
283,"May 21, 2010",John Caylor was an unbelievable salesman. There was no pressure and he wasn't pushy. He was full of information and was very helpful. He has been a great asset after buying the car as well. He is great with customer service and making sure the customer leaves happy. Albereta Williams was also amazing and was very eager to make sure the customer left happy. They both were truly awesome and i would go back to them in a heartbeat. ,5.0

285,"May 20, 2010",Benson Honda is one of a kind. The customer service is superior because of their friendly and knowledgeable staff. They treat you with the respect and provide the best service possible. I have gone to other Honda Dealerships and Benson Honda is by far the best dealership.,5.0
286,"May 15, 2010","My wife and I had the best car buying experience after looking at multiple Honda and Toyota dealerships in San Antonio.  The salesmen (John & Jeff) and sales manager (Craig) worked very hard to give us the lowest price on our new Honda CRV beating all dealerships in San Antonio and Houston.  The staff is very knowledgeable and willing to help.  If you want and a relaxing environment without games or feeling pressured, I would HIGHLY recommend checking out this dealership.  Thanks Benson Honda!",5.0
287,"May 11, 2010","I just wanted to say thank you to the Benson Honda Used salespeople for working with us on the price of the used CRV we just purchased and for fixing the keys not working for my sister Danielle.  I had to walk out of North Park Toyota last week as they would not help us the way you have. We had a stressful few weeks of nervous car shopping.  We prayed and God led us to ya'll. I am very happy with everyone at your location. All your employees Dana, Anette, and Art. They  were all so helpful and awesome. They made us feel very welcome and they were very sincere.  I would recommend you to people as a warm atmosphered, and trustworthy dealership.

This experience has been a great blessing and now my sister and her family finally have a reliable car.  It really really means alot to us.",5.0
288,"February 27, 2008","They went above and beyond to accomodate us.  We got a fantastic deal and will only purchase future vehicles from Benson Honda.  They were friendly, curteous, knowledgable, patient and just plain great!  We also shopped at competitors and were not happy with the level of customer service.  But at Benson Honda we felt like we were #1
