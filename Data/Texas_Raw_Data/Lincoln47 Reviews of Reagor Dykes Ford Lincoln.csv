12,"March 22, 2018",Much improved service. Turn around time improved. Waiting area and bath area much cleaner than previous visits. Only improvement would  be the music in show room was very loud. Ask someone to turn down and was done immediately. With in five minutes a young lady turned it up and made a remark about it being turned down. The same lady went back and ask that it be turned down. It was not just loud and blurring Western Music and here seemed no one was in the sales area. It stayed down this time.,4.8

46,"April 15, 2015","I began working with a salesman and his manager to purchase a car that I found while shopping online. Concurrently, I was working with another dealership to get the best deal for myself, of which these guys were fully aware. The manager offered me a deal which I thought at the time was the best I could get. I agreed to pay $2000 to hold the vehicle for delivery. I then contacted the other dealership to let them know and they then made me an offer I couldn't refuse: $1000 less down payment, almost $100 less per month, and a few thousand less on the overall price of the exact same vehicle. Obviously, this was a much better deal, so I called these guys to apologize for the inconvenience and have them cancel the transaction.

The manager proceeded to admonish me for poor business principals and told me my choice was ""just wrong"". He refused to cancel the transaction and said he had no authority to return my money even though he knew I wouldn't be purchasing the vehicle from his dealership. The manager went on to speak badly of the other dealership, stating he had done all of the work and they took advantage of that so he deserved something from it and he was keeping my $2000. When my husband got involved and asked for a supervisor we were told nobody was available and the call was ended abruptly.

I should mention that all of this transpired within 2 hours (between 5:30pm and 7:30pm).

I have never been treated so badly by someone in customer service. His attitude in losing a deal is absolutely uncalled for and childish. I completely understand his frustration, however, that does not give him nor Reagor Dykes Auto Group the authority to keep my money. We never had anything in writing, I never signed any type of paperwork, let alone a contract, and there is nothing indicated on their website nor was it discussed with me that if I put down money and changed my mind, they would retain the funds.

When I spoke with Bart Reagor the next day, he rambled on for awhile about how these particular employees were like family to him. He tried convincing me to buy the car from him despite the issues I had; when I refused, he flat out said he would not give me my money back because we ""had the makings of a contract"". How unprofessional, let alone illegal!",1.0
