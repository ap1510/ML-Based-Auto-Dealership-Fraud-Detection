1,"March 17, 2019",I do not recommend this dealership to anyone the sales person and the managers are very unprofessional they say that they will put you in a vehicle and that‚Äôs a lie I was with the sales guy and I guess his manager called him and told him something he did not even reply one word to me he just walked off and left Standing there like a piece of trash and when I walked to my car I realize that he had the keys to my car..He didn‚Äôt even have the courtesy to give them back to me I had to ask him for them I guess he wanted me to walk home!üëéüèº,1.0
2,"March 01, 2019","Went in to test drive a two door Jeep Wrangler and had the worst experience I had ever had trying to purchase a vehicle. I was treated very nice till it came to sitting down at their desk to write up some paper work. The sales manager took over and was trying to rush us into just signing for the vehicle and pushing us out the door. As soon as I mentioned the word ""negotiate"" his demeanor changed and said that they do not negotiate. I tried to mention what I found the vehicle going for at another dealership and he just said no and tore up the paper work and walked away. I ended up finding the exact same Jeep for the price I wanted the following month at Dallas Dodge Chrysler Jeep Ram.",1.0
3,"December 23, 2018","Stay away from this dealerships Service department.
Completely unprofessional and unethical.
Had vehicle in service for 2 weeks before ""diagnostics"" even run.
Upon ""diagnostic"" results, it was determined a $715 ""fix"" would resolve issue.
After ""fix"" issue was not resolved and exactly the same as before.
Upon 2nd ""diagnostics"" it was determined that ""fix"" would require another $785 ""fix"".
Fool me once , shame on me, fool me twice...you know the deal.

Stay very far away from these thieves....
Merry Christmas!",1.0

10,"March 23, 2018","I had a fantastic purchase experience buying my 2018 Dodge Challenger. I worked with Melisa DeBolt.
She is a true professional and handled every detail perfectly. From the time I ordered the car to the day it came in. She constantly kept me updated every step of the way. I bought my car from my patio in Florida. Dealing over the internet and by email and text can be tricky.
Melisa is the best iv‚Äôe ever worked with. I love the car, I love the deal I got at Freedom.
Melisa has a customer for life.
Call, email or go see her. You will be glad you did !",5.0
11,"March 21, 2018","The absolute worst service every. If there was a 0 star I would chose it. My driver took my 2015 Ram 3500 in for service and got a quote of $1200 to clean my egr and replace a key fob. After sitting on my truck for more than a week and promising completion dates, they finished the work after a week and a half. My driver went to pick up the the truck and they gave him the wrong bill twice and pull out the wrong truck. Finally they bring out the bill matching my truck and it was more than $3200. This was $2000 more than what the initial quote was. The service guy said they fixed 3-4 other things on the truck so thats why the bill increased. They said I called them and told them to fix everything wrong. The only reason I ever called to the dealership was to check the status of  completion and I continuously got the run around about the completion date. I NEVER told anyone to fix everything that they found. My driver spoke to the service manager and they figured they were doing us a favor but knocking off $400 from the bill for some thing we didn't ask for, but we didn't ask them to fixe the 4 other things either.

37,"August 15, 2017","IF YOU LOVE YOUR CAR, GO TO ANOTHER DEALER FOR REPAIRS. A neighborhood mechanic told me that my son's car needed a WATER PUMP. Took the car in, DARYL in service told me that is was NOT THE WATER PUMP and  I paid them $2500, so $2500 later, after weeks of being in the shop and paying for new belts, head gaskets, hoses, etc...my son gets the car back. I told them to perform a tune-up and oil change since he would be driving the car away for college this fall and I did not want him having car trouble while away at college. The car was still LEAKING antifreeze within a week of having it. My son took the car back to FREEDOM DODGE because we were told by Daryl that the service and parts were under 3 yr. warranty and that they would fix it for free. I was told that Daryl was conveniently out all this week so I had to deal with a man named Tim. TIM  called my son to tell him, wait for it......THE WATER PUMP NEEDED TO BE FIXED. THE WATER PUMP. I told Tim that the WATER PUMP was the problem WHEN I FIRST BROUGHT IT IN and was told by DARYL that is was NOT THE WATER PUMP. So Tim, tells me we need to pay another $800 for the WATER PUMP that was supposed to have been fixed when I first brought the car in but DARYL said that it was NOT THE WATER PUMP. I know that I am a woman and I hear how service providers take advantage of women, I just hate that FREEDOM DODGE has proven that they do this too and that they do not care about their customers or what the situation is THEY JUST WANT THE MONEY! I now do not trust that they will fix the car right. They will probably mess up something else so that we will have to bring it back for them to repair AGAIN. How do I know that they didn't mess up something so that we have to bring it back to them AGAIN.  I do not have any faith in FREEDOM DODGE any more that I do a common robber breaking in my house stealing my money from my purse. FREEDOM DODGE just does it LEGALLY!!! I am a single mom working 7 days a week trying to put my kids in college. I am taking my son's tuition money to get his car fixed, AGAIN. I will not ever take me car to this dealership ever again. I am scared that they may cut my son's brakes or mess up something up so that we will come back and pour more money out to them.  This is a scam and a shame and they should not be able to legally do this to unassuming women. It is not fair, it is not right. I do not know how they can sleep with themselves. I pray that God will hear my prayer so that no one else goes through this insanity!!!!!",1.0
38,"July 28, 2017","We finally bought my Jeep Wrangler here after going around and around with the salesman and finance guy on the price and interest rate for over a week. We traded in my old car and a few months later started receiving parking tickets in the mail for my old car that we had traded in, come to find out this dealership sold my trade in to someone else and didn't remove our license plates! We had to call the dealership numerous times to get them to finally pay the parking tickets! It was to the point the tickets were going to be filed on our credit if they weren't paid. What kind of dealership doesn't remove the previous owners license plates and replace with dealer tags?!? It was ridiculous that we had to call them so many times before this issue was taken care of! Now we have traded in my Jeep and we were informed we needed to go back to the dealership to fill out paperwork to cancel the extended warranty (that they basically force you to get, apparently the dealership makes money off of selling this to you) so we did. We were told we should receive a check in the mail in about 4 weeks. It's been about 2 months and still haven't received anything so we called the warranty company and they said the dealership has not submitted the form we filled out! Needless to say we have contacted the dealership numerous times and no one has returned our calls! This dealership has horrible customer service and I would never purchase a vehicle from them again! Dealing with them is a nightmare!",1.0

44,"June 17, 2017",My wife and I had a great experience purchasing our 2017 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland.

66,"April 20, 2016","My wife and I went to buy a new jeep.  On my arrival I was stopped at the entrance by someone I thought was a gate guard.  After he had me pull over and get out of the car, he said he was a sales person and then directed me to where I could park,  (very unusual to be stopped at the entrance and be asked to get out of the car).  Once I parked several other sales staff came over immediately and when i told them I already had met someone at the entrance they looked at him and laughed and said that I should drive home and come back to deal with them ( I was unsure if they were joking or being honest since two of them made the same comment).  When my wife explained the car she wanted and found out that the car was not available on their lot she said we would come back when they had it because she needed to see the actual car before buying it.   This surprised the salesman but after questioning us a bit longer he understood that was the only way we were going to buy the car   They took her one year old car to get an appraisal ,and came back and told us that there was a ""small"" loss on our car and proceeded  to go over the numbers very quickly.  When i stopped him and re-directed him back to the appraisal price they said was KBB, he  said that was the price and what did I think it was worth.  I told him that I had also gotten a KBB and other appraisal prices and that their price was not even the low end number on any of them.  By this time my wife had stood up to leave and I said we were leaving also.  The sales person kept saying ""sit down"" (not politely) and that we had already come this far and repeated ""sit down"" several times.  We said no thank you and walked out.  When a dealer is this dishonest and does not expect their customers to do advance research on vehicles being traded in and being sold, they will not get our business.  I will never deal with this dealership again.  I only wish I had read the reviews of this dealership prior to going there, we would have gone elsewhere.",1.0

The day after Christmas I inquired about a 2007 S6 Freedom had listed on there website, after negotiating for 3 days, we finally agreed on full price. They would not budge a dime on the car. The only stipulation I had was to get a PPI (pre purchase inspection) before I bought the car. They agreed and I gave them my credit card info to hold the car and my financing information including my social security number. The salesperson William Smith said he would set up an appointment with Audi to get the inspection done. 2 days go by and never got a return phone call. Gave William a call and said he had to go to a meeting and would call back asap. Never got a call back. Called back a day after and said he was busy at the moment and would call back. Never called back. No word on the cars status. Cant get hold of manager, no return phone calls. One would think they would want to sell the customer a car when they are paying FULL PRICE!

85,"October 19, 2014",This was the worst experience I have ever had with buying a car. I wanted to see a Jeep Cherokee but instead they show me a Jeep Commander. I told them that this is not what I want. The financial manager got offended and told me because I wanted payments in the 300s this what I can get. He did not know if I would go up on price if I was shown what I wanted. He comes back with this sheet of paper that demonstrates the prices of cars and the estimated monthly payments.    I told them no and walked out. I went to Don Davis and was shown exactly what I wanted. I had to come up on monthly payment but it was okay because I got exactly what I came for- A Grand Cherokee Limited. I purchase the car the same day... Freeman Dodge Chrysler missed out. It seems to me that they profile their customers. ,1.0

90,"March 12, 2014","My father drove me to this dealership as my family has had business with them for quite some time. I was very impressed with the forwardness and willingness to assist that was shown to me. Because I already had my mind set on purchasing a particular vehicle, the entire process took little under an hour and a half. After a quick test drive and signing of papers, I was shown all the features for both safety and entertainment the car had to offer. I was thoroughly pleased with my visit and I recommend this dealership to anyone looking to purchase one of these brands.",5.0

93,"May 31, 2013","I have purchased several vehicles in the past, some new... some pre-owned. This time I purchased a new Chrysler 300 S. I searched for this vehicle on-line and looked at various dealerships to compare pricing etc. Freedom Chrysler had the car I was looking for and so I decided to make the short drive from Grand Prairie to Duncanville. I expected to be there all night, haggle over the price, the financing etc. (the last new car I purchased was in 2011 and I was in the dealership for 6 hours). To my surprise, this purchase wasn't anything I've expected or ever experienced. Travis Ferguson and his team handled the sale in a very timely fashion. Everyone was very professional and courteous. Most important to me was that there was no hassle. That is why I rated the Customer Service and Friendliness with a score of 5.  

Jason Reed handled the financing portion of this transaction. I liked dealing with Jason, he got things done quickly, he is very laid back and funny. The entire process from A-Z was really ""painless"". That is why I have rated my Overall Experience with a score of 5.

The whole staff that I worked with was wonderful, Jay, and his Used Sales Manager Jesse Walker and the Finance Manager Kyle.

We gave him some significant challenges (that other dealerships weren't even willing to attempt to overcome) and he tackled each one with a smile.  We got what we wanted/needed on the trade and a price that couldn't be beat on the new car.  On top of everything else, we made the deal in less than an hours time!

105,"August 27, 2012","taking advantage of a second chance financing customer wanting to re-establish credit.14,999 for 08 impala wow,did not expect that from a dealership other than we finance car lot , however Freedom Dodge priced a car that other dealerships in the area priced at around 8900.00. Matter of fact I found 7 cars , 3 of them where 09;s. Really would like to know why the need of a grand slam with this used car. What a shame for what i thought was a reputable dealership. Oh well i'm sure others have taken the bait. Just wanted a fair shake and a fair deal but it does not look like one can get one at Freedom Dodge. Will do my part going forward in buyer beware at Freedom Dodge.

106,"March 29, 2012","When i first arrived i was approached by a sales woman, don't remember her name, but could tell it was going to be a bad experience when she didn't know the difference between a charger and a challenger.  She wasted my time by telling me features that were only available on the charger when i was only interested in the challenger.  She then introduced me to her manager who introduced himself as Big Country!  Not very professional if you ask me.  They then spent another 20 minutes checking out my trade-in only to offer a 1/3 of what it the trade in value should have been.  I got 3 times the amount at the dealership i bought from.  I was so mad and fed up with the experience that i immediately walked out.  I don't know why anyone would ever buy a car from this place!!",1.2
