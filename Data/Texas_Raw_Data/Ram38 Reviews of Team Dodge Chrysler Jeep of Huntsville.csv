21,"April 17, 2018","I am from several states away, tried to purchase a dually from this lot. They pushed hard for me to put a refundable deposit down ""just to hold the vehicle"" so I did. When we seen the truck, it appeared to be a flood truck, the seat mounts was rusted, a lot of bolts and brackets rusted, rusty mud under the dash. The exhaust was leaking at the manifold, and several trim pieces loose. This ""very clean, like new"" truck was far from that. The dealership would not refund my deposit, I had to file a dispute with my credit card company. ",1.0

24,"October 23, 2017","I wanted to buy local.  Gave the type of car and date/time I would be there.  Salesman had nothing ready for me to look at. When he did find a vehicle online I was presented with a description and no pictures.   I was there 2:45 hours and talked to my salesman no more than 20 minutes because he was talking with they guy behind the glass. If a salesman cannot make a decision about selling a car; don't hire that salesman.    The finance part was great; quick in and out.  I was told to be there at 11:30 to pickup the car, but salesman had another customer he was helping.  I waited for about 10 minutes and then felt rushed with the explanation of new car.  Overall, the salesman was courteous and professional and we received the car we wanted.  I just wished buying a car was more of a pleasure .",3.2
