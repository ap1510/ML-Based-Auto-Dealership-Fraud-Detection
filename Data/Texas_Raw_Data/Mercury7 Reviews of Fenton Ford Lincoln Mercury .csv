6,"September 15, 2015","I had my CPO vehicle in for service and to have recall repairs made, and it all went well.  Tech was courteous and dealership asked me to schedule a return appointment to try and find results for another issue.  I scheduled an appointment and showed up at the appointed time on the designated date.  I was to leave the vehicle until the following Saturday, and pick it up on my return.  I called on my way into town and was told the vehicle was not ready (6 days at dealership).  I called on Monday, talked to RJ, car was not even on schedule, something came up, NONE of the work had been done (oil change, rattle noise).  Called Tuesday afternoon, still not in, should be in tomorrow....Wednesday it STILL WAS NOT IN THE SHOP.  I called Ford Service  and complained.  The vehicle was serviced and ONLY had the oil changed and tires rotated, two other repair items ignored and I was  it was ready.  And it gets better, they told me I needed to  take it to another dealer.  So I did.  Meanwhile, I acquired a 2015 F-150 from another dealer (one I wanted, not one they wanted me to have because it was in stock), installed a trailer brake controller and stopped by with Ford Motor Company document in had that had instructions on how to activate the controller.  The service writer AND service Manager looked at the written instructions: ""I've never seen this before.""  Then Mike said ""We can't do this; we didn't install it!""  and Oscar said, ""You will have to come back because our IDS machine is tied up right  now, and we have  to reprogram the whole dash.""  Well, bucko, the Ford supplied instructions specifically reads that you merely have to 'enable' the factory brake controller feature...not reprogram the dash.  So obviously these guys want no more of my money.  I will never darken the door on ANY Fenton dealership again, for ANY reason. ",1.8
