0,"March 03, 2020","I will never buy a vehicle from this dealership, again. The customer service after your initial purchase -goes way down.Thanks for nothing! After I cancelled the platinum extended service contract they are dragging their rear ends getting MY refund over $2000 to me. I don‚Äôt understand why it takes 6-8 weeks to process, when it only takes minutes to check all your credit history and put you in a vehicle. I was told by the corporate office that they had not received the paperwork. Mr. Borque states he has sent it and now ‚Äú it‚Äôs out of his hands‚Äù!",2.2

3,"June 13, 2019","Absolutely the worst service department I‚Äôve ever dealt with in my life! They gave me a quote of $2,364.83 for a alignment and 4 tires! When I mentioned I just purchased the vehicle a few months ago Donna went and got permission to do a free alignment  and all of a sudden my tires aren‚Äôt bad but if I want new tires. I‚Äôm responsible for the purchase of tires. I ask why should I be responsible for tires on a vehicle I just bought and she responded maybe we can warranty them out but of course that didn‚Äôt work so she got the head mechanic to tell me it‚Äôs the way I drive that has my tires worn on the outside of all four tires. Meanwhile they get the general manager ( Keith leger )
And he tells me I hit a pot hole or something.... I responded with I guess one big enough for all 4 tires? He said yes and gave me that we care about all or customer crap and walked off üò° now I drive a bmw that sounds like a monster truck while driving ( tires roaring noise )",1.0
4,"March 13, 2019",I've bought 5 BMW's all from a John Robinson. Lonnie in finance always works to get us the best deal. I live in Hoston and have several local options but never get the same level of personal service and ease of doing business than I get from this Beaumont Team. They exemplify the BMW ownership experience and is the reason we are loyal to the brand and this location. John is a true pleasure to work with. ,5.0

They were waiting for me when I got there (along with my two puppies, which were in their kennel). Everyone was so friendly!  I was very grateful they allowed me to bring my puppies inside!!!  You won't find customer service like this at a BMW dealership in Houston. ",5.0

28,"April 21, 2015","To make a very long story short, I bought a car that did not function from another dealership.  That dealership was not addressing the issue quickly or efficiently enough.  I owned the car for three weeks and at least 10 or more days out of that three week period, the car was at another dealers service department with major issues.  I went to Mike Smith BMW to see if I could find another car to replace the expensive clunker I just bought.  John Robinson greeted me and guided me to the right vehicle for me.  He was extremely knowledgeable, sincere in his approach, and not overly ambitious with his sales technique.  He, along with Loney Bourque, was able to get me out of a nightmare of a car and into a Certified Pre-Owned car that I am very satisfied with, so far (knock on wood), and at a much better interest rate than what I previously had.  They're all Aces in my book and if you choose to buy a BMW in Beaumont, do not trust what you are buying unless you are buying from them.  Mike Smith BMW Beaumont is ""Five Star"" service.  -JRS",5.0

Buying experience was excellent with John Robinson. That's where it ended. Service department sucks. I would not recommend this dealer for your BMW service. May have to go to Houston for service.",3.0
31,"September 05, 2014",My husband and I had the best experience purchasing a new vehicle.  John Robinson took his time and worked with us to get exactly the car we wanted.  There was no pressure to buy.  He answered all our questions and was extremely patient.  ,5.0
32,"February 17, 2012",Mr. Calcoate was just simply the best. Thanks for your time and helping me make yet a major decision and a great one with the purchasing of my BMW.,5.0
