1,"July 03, 2019","Everyone in sales and finance, including Mr. Buckalew are outstanding!  But I still have a very minor dent on my door.  The ""dent guy"" comes in on Wednesdays.  This amazes me.  Work does not allow me toget off on Wednesdays.  I have had this dent in my new truck for a month.  

I do recommend this Chevy Store for sales and ownership.  <><",2.6
2,"June 10, 2019","I went into Buckalew Chevrolet on Saturday 06/08/2019. I had spoken to Jeff Rae a couple of times the day before about what I was looking for in the truck I wanted to purchase. I was assured that the vehicle was on the lot and it would be there when I arrived. When I entered the dealership I was greeted by the receptionist even though her phone was constantly ringing. I told her who I was looking for and Jeff came right over as soon as he finished with the customer he had in front of him. He had a some paperwork that he was finishing up so he introduced me to a salesman by the name of Ryan Mccollough. Ryan took me right to the vehicles I wanted to see and told me about the discounts and all the other deals that were going on this month. ( Jeff had told me the day before but I was not sure if I wanted to get a 2019 or a 2018 at the time) I found the Truck that I was interested in and we took it for a test drive. At no time was I rushed. I do not believe he looked at his watch even once while I was trying to figure out what color I liked best. After I picked out the vehicle we went back in to see Jeff. He had all the paperwork completed and I went right into finance. I was in finance about 5 to 10 minutes and I drove off in a brand new truck. 
The dealership was extremely clean, there were no high pressure sale pitches, and everybody was extremely courteous and I felt like the did the research to find me exactly what I wanted and needed at the lowest price possible.  ",5.0
3,"March 09, 2019","Service department is horrendous. My car has been in for service four times already. Every visit has taken two weeks. The reason is because my car sat for a week before they even thought about working on it. This last visit required a special order for the part. I waited until dealership received the part and then took my car inn for service. Again, even though they had parts, my car sat for a full week before they started to work on it. To top it all off they did NOT correct issue. I wish I could upload videos of how my car sounded before ""repair"" and how it sounds now. It is far worse now after replacement of new steering column. Terrible service dept - after the numerous poor reviews you would think management would correct issue.",1.0
4,"August 07, 2018","This place is a dying breed really as the name on the sign means something because they still own the dealership.My moms salesperson Amy Mcguigan was exceptional and I would highly recommend you ask for her if you want a pleasant no bs experience. This was by far and away the easiest vehicle purchase I have ever been a part of.Scott Kaufman one of the managers was awesome too..Donnie Buckalew even came by and visited with us as well,most dealers wouldn't bother to take the time.If you are in the market for a Chevy or a used car I highly recommend Buckalew Chevrolet.No hidden dealer fees that a lot of dealers charge to pad their bottom line.",5.0
5,"March 26, 2017","I began my search for a new suburban at Buckalew Chevrolet, my salesman Jeff Rea was incredibly knowledgeable about the vehicle which was a plus but one of the best things was I felt comfortable with the process there. He had my car appraised and as soon as it was over he handed me my keys back which made me feel like I could leave if I wanted too! Then I told him I needed to pick up my kids soon and he had the vehicles pulled that would work for me and went over the features quickly but efficiently, no messing around with maybe this one or that one, it was too the point and not a waste of my time! 
I went to other dealerships and had horrible experiences, I had one just down the freeway, that actually kept me there for over 2 hours, wouldn't give me my keys back, brought around cars that I wasn't interested in but tried to push and of course the vehicle I went in to look at had miraculously just been sold!
I kept comparing the other dealerships to Buckalew and to Jeff Rea and realized that I would much rather do business with them! I also realized that although the other dealers seemed to have a better price when I went back to compare apples to apples there actually wasn't any comparison! The other dealers were adding in ""dealer packages"" and not being honest about their prices. Buckalew showed me everything I was paying for and not adding any hidden fees or charges. 
I finally went back to Jeff and made the deal! I got there late one evening but we worked the deal quickly and instead of making me wait he put all the paperwork together and I came back the next morning. We were able to go straight to the finance office and John Withrow had us in and out in less than 10 minutes!
I have bought several cars in my life and have actually worked at two different dealerships and this was the easiest, most painless car buying experience I have ever had in my life!!! 
I would and have recommended Jeff Rea to anyone looking to buy a Chevrolet in the future! ",5.0
6,"January 27, 2017","Dissatisfied with dealerships handling of request for a second key for Chevrolet Cruze purchased from them. Being a used vehicle even though costing thousands of dollars, the car came with only one key. They proceeded to explain my options on how I can spend money to get another key. After over thirty years of loyalty to Chevrolet, I am seriously considering if I will purchase my next new vehicle from them.",1.0
7,"September 23, 2016","Rick my Internet sales Manger was terrific. He was prompt to contact me, listened to my needs and wants and matched that to the perfect vehicle. I love my new truck. They even made sure I got the best deal and worked to get me the financing I needed at a terrific rate. Their financial specials are awesome. I have already had my first service check up and the service department were friendly,and timely. I love my dealership!!!",5.0
8,"June 24, 2016","When I read some reviews about poor performance of a company, I have to wonder about the person who wrote the review. you can believe this with blind faith, that you would be better off going anywhere else than work with these folks. In fact RUN!!!!!!!!!!!! the service writers are too inexperienced and act like they are doing you a favor. as far as the mechanics, very inexperienced. the back of the shop is filthy mess and parts laying around. and to add insult to injury, items were stolen out of my vehicle. 
the list of the workers:
1) Donnie - does not know what is going on in the service depart and just make excuses. was supposed to get back to me but now is MIA!
2) Kevin - poorly trained and likes to hear himself talk. asked if they had an express service to put a filter and denied they did. to my surprise Express Service is listed on their website. 
3) Noah - witnessed him rough housing the vehicle and has no clue about the vehicle or diagnosing. told the technician he would not change the filter unless he changed the housing. That is because he busted the housing,  I was there when he did it. I got to pay for it. He knows nothing about diesels. then to add insult to injury, he stole items out of my vehicle. you are a real classless act!

after 40 years, I see this dealership has not changed. 

Liars and Thieves - have no use for them!!!!!!!!!!

if you are smart, RUN RUN RUN !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

9,"October 28, 2015","****Please do a walk around on your vehicle when you leave it at there Service dept*****
****Check your White vehicle for the little dots in your paint that is rail dust and is covered by warranty***

I had my wife's vehicle in there Service dept  for warranty items. First item was for rattle coming from the front bumper area. They called me two days later to tell me that they could not look at my rattle because the front bumper had a dent in it. I told them that my bumper did not have any damage when I drop it off . There service writer Rick did a walk around inspection and there was no damaged when I drop it off.
Well today I got to speak with Steve Romine and he told me he was not covering the damaged.
Second warranty item it was in for was rail dust. I went to pick it up after being told it was done but of course it was not done at all. Rick told me he was going to get his Manager Steve. Steve told me that they did it but I showed him where it was not done. he started to tell me that vehicle do not have rail dust any more. I told him that was impossible because vehicle are shipped by rail road car. Then I showed him all the other vehicle on there lot that have rail dust. He went on to tell me that warranty on pays them $15.00 to remove rail dust. It took them twice to fix the rail dust mean while  i'm driving my new Chevy truck with a rattle.By the way if you have a  WHITE VEHICLE look at your paint closely those little yellow/orange dot in it  well that  is rail dust and the dealer should warranty it.

10,"July 22, 2015","We would recommend Buckalew Chevrolet  to anyone, because they are what every car dealership should be: top notch customer service from a company built on honesty and family values.  We purchased a 2015 Tahoe and love it. Mona Hamby was our sales person and was a total pleasure to work with. The service we received from Mona Hamby  was top notch PLUS she knew EVERYTHING about the features of the Tahoe. We've been buying vehicles from Buckalew Chevrolet for many years and would not think of going anywhere else.

11,"July 18, 2015","We had a specific car color and interior that was hard to find in a short time frame and they got it done. Hernand Hernandez did the research, made the calls, and got the car we wanted for a great price! From the secretary that took our call all the way up to the gen manager Barry Millenson was just a great experience.",4.8
12,"July 15, 2015","Left car on may 14.....no communication from service dept for six weeks except for two times I called. Investigated my concerns, said they could not fix, and gave car back to me exactly as it, and did not even get a quote from body shop as I requested. 
They did give me a loaner, and replace carpet. I was very Ill and could not bombard them with calls...they obviously did not care about contacting me. Second bad experience here. Would never ever ever use again !!!
In what universe is it ok to not contact a customer for six weeks, regardless if what else is going on ?",1.5
13,"July 07, 2015","We had been shopping for a 2015 Chevy Tahoe for a few months. When we went into Buckalew to look at the Tahoe's, Hernand helped us. He showed us several Tahoe's and took us on a test drive. We came in several times to see Hernand he never pressured us. He went out of his way to show us several Tahoe's. When we finally decided to buy our Tahoe he was there to help us all the way through getting us a great deal! Hernand went over and beyond for us making sure we got exactly what we wanted. Thank you Buckalew and Hernand Hernandez!

14,"July 05, 2015","Made appt for 2015 Tahoe to have a/c charged,  a wash & detail, plastic trim on steering wheel replaced, front side windows tinted, and 2 tires replaced under warranty due to damage. When they took vehicle to have windows tinted, they damaged another tire! Picked up nail apparently? So 3 tires replaced. The steering wheel trim was NOT replaced. They took 2 weeks!!! Within reason all maint takes time. But not 2 weeks for what needed to be done! ",1.7
15,"March 11, 2015",Three hours from home on a trip and our 2009 Tahoe starts act up causing some serious hinderance to our driving plans. I did a little research and found the problem may be covered under a previous recall. I showed up at the dealer at 8:30 on a Wednesday and was out by 10:30! The problem ( throttle position sensor) was covered indeed by the recall and I paid $0! Now back to our vacation! ,5.0
16,"December 26, 2014","My 87 year old mother took her car to Buckalew service because a warning light came on her car's dash. They told her that it would cost ""thousands of dollars"" to repair her Buick. And that she ""needed a new car"". When she refused to speak to a salesperson they sent her away. She had me look at her car and it only needed a $20 dollar water pump, nothing else. Her car still runs very well to this day. 
I called the dealership to complain and Donnie Buckalew could not have cared less about attempted defrauding people who came to his dealership/service department for repairs. Seems they prey on women and elderly for their sustenance. 
Will never do business there again, nor will my family. How many others have been ripped off by this place?",1.0
17,"December 14, 2014","I can't say enough good things. The personal service that Hernand Hernandez gave us is by far the best we've ever had. He was beyond helpful. My wife and I arrived at the dealership late, with our two young sons, and at no time did we ever feel rushed. Even when it came time to visit with the financing guy, we were still treated very well.  I recommended Hernand to my mom for her recent purchase and she had the same great experience my wife and I had.  Everyone we dealt with was very family friendly.  Anyone who is in the market for either buying or leasing a vehicle would do themself a favor buy dealing with Hernand.  ",5.0
18,"November 07, 2014","They had a recall on our Chevy, we took it in and had it serviced. They DID NOT repair our car. They actually broke the part they were supposed to be fixing, and now they REFUSE to fix it. HORRIBLE service, I will never buy from this company and you can bet I will let everyone know that they are RUDE, and refused to fix an issue that THEY BROKE! What a bad place to do business.",1.0
19,"November 03, 2014","I took my Chevrolet Silverado in for a few minor things to be fixed on the morning of Novermber 3. I dropped vehicle off at about 7:30 am. My service writer Nick took the information and stated he would contact me to inform me of the work. At about 11:30 am, I called to check status of repairs and was going to ask if I would need to leave it overnight and obtain a rental. NIck never returned my call, I ended up calling him 8 times over the course of the day and left several voicemails checking the status of my vehicle. Didnt mind it staying overnight, I just needed to be informed if a rental was necessary. They close @ 7 and I called for the 9th time about 6:00. Talked with another service advisor and they actually had to yell at Nick across the service department to ask if the vehicle had to stay overnight. Well, it did. Also Nick stated there were no rentals available and it was too late to call Enterprise, etc. So I had to pick up my vehicle with no repairs done, but more importantly no communication at all from Nick. Extremely dissatisfied with Buckalew Chevrolet and Nick. Will never return there but wanted to leave this review in the case anyone else is going there. ",1.0
20,"July 26, 2013","I took my Chevy Cruze in for an oil change and tire rotation. When they were done, no one came to go over their additional findings with me. They just handed me my paperwork and said thanks. I had asked Cordale to be sure and ask them to check my brakes and brake fluid  oil cbecause I had three different service lights coming on. I knew they wouldn't be able to fix it right then, but at least would know what needed to be done on another date. Well, they obviously didn't check anything because the lights still came on after I left. I took it back by the following Monday and they checked the brake fluid and said it was low. They wanted to write up a ticket on it and charge me over $100 but I couldn't do that. So they finally decided to just fill the fluid up and see if that took care of it, and it did. Also, there was a nail in my tire on the day I had my oil changed and no one bothered to tell me about it. I had to read through my paperwork and find where it said that, after driving to work all week. It would really be nice if they would send someone out to go over the findings with the customer before sending you home. Other dealerships do this. I will not go back to this dealership.",2.4
21,"February 07, 2013",My wife and I went in to this dealership and had the best experience we have ever had.  Everyone was so friendly and never did we feel our salesperson was pressuring us to buy.  He went over all the features of the Malibu with us.  He showed us two different trim levels and really explained the option differences.  When we made our decision to purchase he went over all the figures and explained all the fees and taxes.  I would strongly recommend Buckalew to anyone who would like to have a pleasant buying experience.,4.8
22,"November 05, 2012",It took them four days to even look at my car!!  Then another two days to fix it. The problem was under warranty but they said I needed to have something else done and it wasn't under warranty which would cost $200.00.  I agreed to it. Went to pick up my vehicle and they wanted $500.00.  I'm still fighting with them. ,1.0
23,"August 25, 2012","  Took my 2008 Avalanche in for service, warranty work. I have had my car serviced at Buckalew before. I bought this vehicle used from Ms. Mona Hamby at this dealership. Outstanding service and sales folks. This company makes you feel at home. While having my vehicle serviced I toured the lot with Ms. Hamby and was shown the 2013 Chevrolet Avalanche, last year for this model. Black Diamond, well I was smitten. Bought one and left my other in the shop. I will pick it up later because it is such a great machine I don't want to part with it. This "" Black Diamond"" is a fantastic automobile. 
     Great service and the sales and finance department was fast, smooth no hitches no gitty-ups. Just plain good folks to work with. The owner introduced himself , again to thank me for the business. 
     I would not hesitate to recommend this dealership to anyone.

24,"March 08, 2012","Beverly in the service department at Bucklew Chevrolet was very rude.  Said that our warranty on our pre certified vehicle, we just bought in December 2011, was expired.  I told her we purchased the vehicle with the 12 Month/12,000 miles bumper to bumper and she told us she could only go with what was on her computer and we would have to pay for our service.  We asked if there was anything she could do to address the problem with Mac Haik, and she said that was our job.  Overall interpretation of her attitude was she did not care to assist us and wanted to charge us.  Why would I trust her with my vehicle?  A simple call to Mac Haik, by us, to Lee Roy, sales manager, fixed the problem in a matter of minutes.  Of course we will have Mac Haik, who is on the other side of town from us, service our vehicle.   Boo Beverly!",1.0
25,"June 23, 2011",Mr. Koukas came very highly recommended to us and we were not disappointed. He was personable and very easy to talk with. Jimmy went above and beyond in serving us in our indecision and even come in to work with us on his day off!!! Unfortunately we did not purchase a car from Buckalew Chevrolet but we certainly can see ourselves purchasing one from them in the future. With each visit we were met with a smiling staff and an extremely clean and appealing environment. ,5.0
26,"March 24, 2011","   As we pulled into a parking space in front of Buckalew Chevy, the so called seasoned professional car salesman was stalking us in front of our car waiting on us to step out of the vehicle (vehicle still runnig mind you).  We were preyed upon as soon as we stepped out by him going after the wife and little ones that were with me.  We did find the type of vehicle we wanted and finally purchased at another dealership in town but the vultures could not bring the price down more than a few dollars below that internet price (laughing out loud). The sales rep. with his diamond encrusted ""sticking it to the customer"" car dealer super bowl ring looked smugly at me and sir this is the best that we can do.  I went to a competitor in town and promptly bought the same vehicle with better mileage, warrant and it was ""certified"" (the other was not) for a better price (approximately $4000.00 cheaper).  I will not be returning to the shark infested waters of the Buckalew parking lot anytime in the near future to purchase a vehicle.",1.0
27,"June 12, 2006","My husband went there after a LOOONG day of shopping at every car dealer around.  The staff was extremely friendly, did not try to sell us something we didn't want and took us ot exactly what we were asking for.  They gave us a decent amount for our trade and gave it to us straight on everything dealing with the sale.  Even the financing.

Needless to say - a Buckalew vehicle is in our driveway tonight.  I have never come on to something like this to write a review - but this shows how extremely satisfied we are.",5.0
