1,"February 01, 2012","The sales experience that I received at Bentley of Austin was above and beyond. My sales associate was Mr. Jeffrey Kahn and he made my car buying experience one that I will remember for the rest of my life. I came in from out of town and from the pickup at the airport to the signing of the documents Jeffrey was there giving top notch service. Thanks and I would highly recommend Bentley of Austin. 
PS : I purchased a Bentley and I love it!!!!   ",5.0
2,"December 10, 2011",My salesperson was Jeffery Kahn at the John Eagle European Dealership.  I found him to be extremely professional and knowledgeable.  I was given a tour of the showroom facility as well as the service department and personally introduced to the service department manager.  The price I paid for the Bentely was fair to both parities and I would definetly recommend both Jeffery Kahn and the dealership to others.   ,5.0
