13,"March 08, 2019","Salesman and the lady that processed my paperwork made it A good experience. The operator at the front desk was rude and unpleasant, otherwise it would of been a five star rating. It was the rolling of her eyes and popping the ear bud out her ear and asking what could she do for me now among other words...( rude tone) that took away from the experience. 
The service manager Linda is very pleasant and provided excellent service when I went to pick up my spare tire for my truck.
Thank you for your service and I'm looking forward to future business.

The service guy told me I had free car washes for life but he said my window sticker with the code was not there. I have never had a window sticker up in the top left hand corner of my windshield. How can I get one?

38,"February 19, 2019","I made an appointment to have my wife’s 4Runner serviced. It took the service guys 1.5 hours to perform the oil change and tire rotation. Unsure why you take appointments if the wait is no longer than an unscheduled walk-in. I paid extra for a service agreement, which, by the way, you should be ashamed of the misleading that went on there, your service coordinator tried to charge me for the services performed. When I stated that I’d perchased the extended service agreement, she became indignant towards me stating I should have told her when I arrived, oh contrar, she should have looked it up. It took 2 key strokes to verify I wasn’t lying to her, why couldn’t she just add that step to her check-in process. It was a very bad experience, as if my time was not valuable to them at all. Disappointed to say the least. ",2.2

46,"February 14, 2019","I made an appointment immediately after lunch to have a tire replaced. I did not expect this to be a lengthy process since it didn't involve any major repairs... Take the old tire off; put the new tire on. I was at the dealership for about 1-1/2 to 2 hours. All associates I dealt with were courteous and friendly. Toyota Service Website needs improvement. Delete appointment button does not work. The site should also have a way to update the user profile. I have a duplicate vehicle listed and can not delete it. Poor design and functionality. Additionally, a text was sent to my phone asking if I wanted updates, but it was unclear as to the proper way to respond. I asked for updates but received none. I also receive text asking if I would like to schedule my next service, but it, too, is poorly worded and obviously not checked or responded to which will, unfortunately, make the texts a nuisance.

I was told by a young Sales Person that there was no more financing deals they ended in December and that things I was asking for were not available so I left that dealership and decided to go home and call Patrick. Patrick answered all my questions and informed me that the other dealership was wrong about the financing and some options I was interested in.

Patrick was extremely helpful as well as Dillon in pointing me to the right truck for me and I was able to get the financing and everything worked out better than expected. Kinsel has the knowledge and they are very professional and friendly.  I will continue to use Kinsel. Patrick Pena is the reason I came to Kinsel this time and he’s the reason I bought what I bought.

Over 9000 cool points to both of these individuals, they deserve recognition and 3 tier chocolate cake in the break room (or angles food, whatever they’re into) and those sparkler type candles that makes it look extra exciting, like in the movies.

2. I came one time for service and was called the next day saying I needed to come back to have my filters changed. So another trip back to Toyota.
3. That same time I had my tire light on. This dealership said they couldn’t figure out why, so put air in and sent me on my way. Tire light came back on later that day. Took it to Discount Tire and I had a pretty obvious nail. Another wasted trip.
4. This time I had a missed call from Toyota. I had dropped my car off for service and assumed they were calling to say it was finished. No message left. I called the number back and the gentleman asked if he could schedule a service. I said “No, my car is there now getting serviced. Is it ready?”  He said, “So you don’t need to schedule?”..... he finally checked and my car was ready. I had expected a call when it was finished. 

I love Toyota but can’t stand this service department. The reps are always running around frantically and then act confused when they can’t figurd out my pre-paid service plan. Yes I understand I bought my car in “a different region” but come on! I bought it from a a Toyota dealership!

I told them this was a mistake due to the fact that I had not reached the 3 years (2 through Toyota and an additional year for keeping my Kinsel Toyota sticker on my rear window) or 36,000 miles yet. They then went to inspect my kinsel sticker and came back and said that It was an older sticker and that they didn't recognize it. Maybe they thought it was fake?? After a few goings back and forth we came to the aggreement that I was correct and therefore did not have to pay. Upon being handed my receipt one of the sales associates slammed his finger down on the 3 year anniversary printed on the receipt and said ""THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME ITS FREE!"" I didn't feel it was appropriate for him to raise his voice and point that out. I am well aware of when I purchased the car and can do simple math to determine my 3 year anniversary date.

The light continue to come on which was an indicationthat the air pressure of the tires are low.  I returned the service department and explained the situation.  They checked the air pressure of the tires and I was told that the problem was that there was a malfunction of the SENSOR indication of the air pressure and that if I wanted the light to go off it would cost me $250.  This was not a problem BEFORE I bought the new tires and had them placed on my truck, therefore I do not think I should be charged $250 just to have the air SENSOR indicator repaired.  The sensor was in perfect shape before the tire change therefore I think it should be taken care of at not charge.",2.4
