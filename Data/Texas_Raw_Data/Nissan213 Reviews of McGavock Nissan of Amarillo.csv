136,"June 24, 2017","We have owned 4 Nissans and were about to buy our fifth. Sadly, this will not happen. McGavok Nissan used to care about customer satisfaction. That is not the case in Amarillo, Texas. Not only phone calls are not returned, especially by a McGavok, and when they are.... they misrepresent the truth. My 2007 Murano was brought in around March 2017 for a noise, that according to service department service writer Ben, and confirmed by a mechanic the timing chain was going out. During the same visit, my battery was replaced as it had gone bad according to Ben. Alternator was not checked. The car was brought back in for timing chain replacement. Car was kept for 6  days. Upon picking up, same noise was heard, informed Ben. Power steering pump went out shortly after that, car towed to McGavok, three days later fixed, noise still there so that was not the problem either. Three weeks ago, the noise got even louder and boom, the car left me stranded and towed to McGavok Nissan by Cierra towing. Left notes as to what happened. Was not called on Monday. By 1:00 PM called Ben and it was the alternator. They had one in stock, instructed them to install. The car was kept until Tuesday afternoon where I had to call again and was told it was ready. I asked why I was not called and Michelle stated Ben had called my husband and left voice mail. Not true. I had left my cell with my key fob at the time of the tow on Saturday and was not called. When I picked the car up on Tuesday, the noise was gone. The alternator was the problem all along. I could have had my car three months back in the same day at the tune of $750.00 instead of the 3400.00 for timing chain. Service manager after being called twice and the general manager stated nothing could be done to make it right since the noise factor remaining after timing chain problem not listed on a work order. Not only did I state to Ben but also mentioned on all the surveys about the work performed that I received.

The Finance Manager, Justin Reavis, was also very nice to deal with and was not a pushy person to deal with at all, but was knowledgable and informative in what we needed and felt we could afford.

We talked about where to look and after an internet search decided to try McGavock Nissan first. Online  we found some nice possibilities and one vehicle really caught our attention--a 2016 Nissan Frontier.  The next Saturday we arrived at the dealership and  looked at trucks. We had been there less  than five minutes when  sales representative Bob Cowley came and introduced himself  and offered his assistance. He was very nice, patient, and answered all of our questions regarding buying new vs used and every other question  we had. We told him what vehicle we really wanted but we hadn't written down the stock number from the website. He walked us in to the show room and offered us beverages and snacks and asked us to wait inside where it was warm and he would go out on the lot to find the truck we had described. He was back with the exact truck we wanted in a few minutes, and we were astounded that he found it with so little description to go on. The test drive was great, and I know we bombarded Bob with even more questions, which he answered calmly and concisely.  Bob got all the information for the finance manager and while we waited, he would check on us to make sure every thing was ok and again offered us a beverage and snack. We just couldn't believe how well we were treated, not like customers, but more like we were really great friends. Such a wonderful experience!  Justin Reavis, our finance manager, came out and explained everything, from our monthly payment to our warranties, when to bring our 2016 Frontier in for oil changes and maintenance. He answered all of our questions and was so great to us, just like Bob was. Bob helped us get our cell phones synced and we were on our way.

206,"February 12, 2016","We had an awesome day with Gerald! He was very polite, helpful but most of all PATIENT!! We test drove several cars and he was very knowledgeable about each one. He never once seemed frustrated, even after the million questions we had... He made sure that we were going to be happy with whatever choice we made! The staff at Nissan made us feel ""at home"" which is something we hadn't experienced at previous dealerships. We left very happy :)",5.0
207,"February 12, 2016","Gerald is super friendly and helpful.  He answered all of my never ending questions and was positive the whole time.  We test drove everything I asked about and made sure I was happy.  If he didn't know an answer, he would find it on the website or ask someone else.  He saved my wt parking permit which saved me $40.  When I brought the truck in to get leather seats, he helped me move items out of the way before I left.  He personally brought each car to the closest spot to me.  Great job Gerald.",5.0
208,"November 19, 2015","We drove home with our first car, a new Nissan Rouge and we couldn't be happier that we got it from Mcgavock Amarillo!! Mr. Marvin Green was the best Sales Consultant for the job. He got us in a great deal and in the shortest amount of time. He was very professional but treated us like family. He made our first car buying experience easy as a breeze. Also, the staff were courteous and served us with genuine smiles throughout our transaction at the dealers showroom. We could not contain our excitement when we drove our car for the first time. We will definitely be recommending!! Thank you Mcgavock Amarillo. More power!",5.0
209,"September 13, 2014",Went in to trade car I've only had for 9 months thinking I was just wasting my time.  Boy was I wrong.  Salesman Marvin Green and staff got me into a brand new car at a lower interest rate and a deal that just made sense.  Wasn't the typical car buying experience as I never felt pressured or bothered.  I would definitely recommend visiting this dealership.,5.0
