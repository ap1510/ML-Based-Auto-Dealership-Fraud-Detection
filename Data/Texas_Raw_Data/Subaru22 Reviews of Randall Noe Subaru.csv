Shannon Wagoner is the best Sales Manager I have ever worked with, she made my purchase happen after another Dealership would not.  Everyone in the dealership is friendly & helpful from the moment you open the door.  Would not hesitate to recommend Randall Noe Subaru for your car purchase, what a great team.",5.0

2,"June 01, 2019","Purchased a 2018 Subaru BRZ from Randall Noe Subaru a few months back, it was by far the best experience I have ever had! The sales managers Kayla and Shannon went above and beyond to make sure my vehicle needs were met, they were both very courteous and friendly. From the experience I've received from them, I will only buy and have my vehicle serviced with Randall Noe Subaru! ",5.0
3,"July 28, 2018","When I purchased my 2017 Outback from Sam it was a fantastic experience.  I greatly enjoy this vehicle.  I now wondered, ""How will they treat me in the Service Department""?  I came in for my oil change and tire rotation today.  The Service Manager, DC, examined my vehicle and Cory took it to the service bay with no time wasted.  Service Consultant, Stephen was the ultimate gem of my visit.  He treated me with great respect and I watched him handle other service appointments.  He also was very personable with these customers.  I am a bit finicky with my vehicle and Stephen answered all of my questions.  To my surprise, he also had the service team change my interior air filter to make sure that the airflow stayed consistent in this extremely hot weather.  

This is what the Randall Noe group should continue to do...hire people like Stephen!  Thanks again, Mr. Noe.  I would love to offer this type of testimony on one of your upcoming marketing projects and media spots.  

Every day is a new day and I will be back at Randall Noe for my vehicle needs!

Best regards,

4,"August 24, 2017","DO NOT BUY A USED VEHICLE FROM THEM.  I purchased a 2014 Subaru Forester from them less than 2 Months ago.  After signing the papers I discovered that the radio did not function at all and the AC Compressor begin to work intermittently.  I contacted the dealership and they offered to have the radio fixed which was the least they could do.  When I had another dealership confirm that the AC compressor was bad,  I contacted Randall Noe and they said since I didn't buy the ""extended warranty"" they wouldn't help me at all.  That repair costs around $1000 and Randall Noe said they wouldn't even give me a penny toward it.   Obviously, they do not care about taking care of the customer or being honest about the vehicles they offer for sale.  I will never do business with them again... and if you have read this review, you should reconsider purchasing a broken vehicle from them. ",1.2

6,"May 25, 2017","After checking the web page on line, I decided to drive to Terrell ( approximately 45 miles from my home in Dallas ). This visit was not only well worth the 45 minute drive, but  the contact with my Sales Consultant ( Brent Billingsly ) was the perfect blend of knowledge & sales without the aggressive push to close the deal on the spot. There was no excessive calling and he had all my contact info. Jason in finance and the Sales Manager Shannon Wagoner were outstanding partners in securing my business. Thanks "" Randall Noe "" of Tyler Texas you're the best!       Marva J. ",5.0
7,"May 14, 2017","This was my first car buying experience and I didn't know it could be this painless. Everyone at Randall Noe Subaru was wonderful to say the least. Sam is an awesome salesman, friendly but in no way pushy at all. He answered every one of my questions. Justin the finance manager helped ease my tension even more, working with me to get the numbers right where I wanted them and really helping me understand it all in layman's terms. If this is how car buying is supposed to be I will definitely keep my business with these guys at Randall Noe Subaru. I also wanted to give a special shout out to Charis, their internet sales manager in getting me started on the path to being an extremely happy customer. Thanks!!!",5.0

9,"May 05, 2017","Price was exactly what I wanted to pay and what I wanted in my Forester, Excellent service, prompt with paper work, all staff friendly and helpful. Same staff was there from 2 yrs ago when my daughter bought her Subaru Crosstrek 2015. ",5.0

11,"April 08, 2017","I want to thank Randall Noe Subaru for great customer service.  I found my 2017 Outback with help from Sam and Kayla.  This was an easy transaction that took less than 30 minutes.  I am also taking advantage of of the additional Love closing where a rep is coming to my residence to go over the enhanced technology that is on my Outback.  I highly recommend the Subaru Outback and if you are in the DFW area, Randall Noe is the best place to buy one.  The staff there is the best I have seen in new car sales.  Thanks again!

12,"September 01, 2016","I was looking for a Subaru Legacy Limited ( one year pre-owned or New ).  I had also met salesmen and  test drove Audi 5, Mercedes C250, E350 and BMW 528 in the Dallas area.  I wandered upon Randall Noe Subaru from the Subaru web-site as I was not finding many 2016 pre-owned Legacy Limiteds.  But Voila - there was one in Terrell and in a color I liked and less than 10K in miles.  My sales experience with Randall Noe was driving out to take a test drive, doing additional research on the car, looking at a new 2017 car at Subaru Plano and getting a price quote from Subaru Mckinney on a new 2017.  I then talked price with Randall Noe Dealer and 36 hours later I was purchasing the car.

I would like to call out Salesman ( his business card has Sales Consultant on it ) Eric Showler for his friendly and thorough way of walking me through the Car's features.  I found his dual style of he driving the car to show the features in detail and then letting me test drive the car immediately after switching drivers very effective.  There are alot of features on that car ( Eyesight, Blindspot detection and auto correct, Stereo with integrated apps, ... I learned more with Eric about the Car than I did with the Subaru Plano test drive and all other calls with Plano and Mckinney dealers combined.  Besides really liking the car, Eric made me feel comfortable with the dealership and I opted to purchase two days ago.  The pickup experience went as expected - no surprises.  Price negotiation was done over a couple days in advance by phone/email.  No surprises when picking the car up.

I interacted with one Subaru plano at the dealership and one Mckinney plano dealer by email/phone.  While I did not have a problem with either of those, Eric did stand above the crowd on the overall sales process ( mostly through knowledge of the car and willing to spend time with the buyer to explain it all ).  I bought a Certified pre-owned 2016 with less than 8,000 miles on it ... it looks (and smells) like the new 2017 models I test drove.  ",4.8
13,"June 09, 2016","I was sold on the car the second I sat down in it, but it was still refreshing to not have a salesman trying to push something on me.  He explained all the features, seemed real and honest.  Very down to earth guy.  Ryan was awesome.  He had to make the real sale.  I had a price when I walked in and anything over was too much.  He was honest with me about the cost of the car and a little pushy (but respectful) it's his job.  I couldn't recommend these guys more!  Very professional!  Go buy a Subaru from them!",4.8
14,"May 28, 2016","Sam is one great salesman! He is kind, honest and helpful without being pushy, which is rare in car salesmen these days. And Ryan, the finance manger, is super nice too. I was dreading the car buying experience but with Sam and Ryan it was pleasant and easy. Thank you both! If our Subarus ever wear out we will be back! ðŸ™‚

15,"May 27, 2016","A great buying experience. The staff was knowledgeable, friendly, helpful, and no pressure. Randall Noe himself introduced himself and asked about my experience. He spoke in superlatives about his staff and he was right. Sam, Shannon, Kayla , and Ryan worked together as a team. I could not have gotten better service plus I got a good price on my Crosstrek.

16,"July 10, 2015","Living in Dallas, my exchange with the Sales Consultant Kayla Lowery was limited to emails & phone calls..  Kayla was always prompt to return my emails & calls.  I got my 2015 Outback at the EXACT price that I was promised!  Not only, but all the paperwork was prepared & ready for me when I arrived in Terrell.  There were ABSOLUTELY no nasty surprises (some good ones, actually).  Ryan Ruiz was wonderful, taking over an hour to go over essential details about the vehicle (like he said: it's a computer on wheels).  I had a misunderstanding about the car on the way home & called the dealership, very concerned.  They were excellent at answering all my questions & educating me on the situation.  Shannon W. even called me back the next day to make sure everything was alright. It is unheard of in this day & age that someone will seek you out, knowing you may not be happy: but she did!  Unbelievable!  I cannot recommend this dealership enough.  I saved so much money just making that 30 minute drive from Dallas. It was stress-free.   Stop at Pop's Honey Fried Chicken or Ham's Peach Orchard.  I am so happy I bought from Randall Noe Subaru.  Thank you Kayla, Ryan & Shannon.",5.0
17,"May 20, 2015","Ryan is the poster child for the stereotypical salesman that the world has come to loathe. While talking to me about the car I was interested in he shamelessly lied to me about the dealer add-ons that he wanted to charge me $3000 for when the actual value of the package is probably around $200 but really doesn't add value to the car. Talked about home awesome the security bolt is and how it prevents people from taking your car by disabling the starter if you remove the bolt. Well, the manufacturer has already done that by installing an engine imobilizer if the proper key is not present. Also, he conveniently ignored the fact that even if someone removes the security bolt it really doesn't matter. One only needs a paperclip a piece of aluminum foil placed in to the bolt receptacle and the car will start just fine. He spoke to a paint protector that had been added to the car which was nothing more than an overpriced wax job that really doesn't protect the paint. He was just selling lies. His manager Shannon was just as bad. To your face she is a sweet old grandma but in reality she is a salty old snake in the grass. Never have I witnessed such a gross misrepresentation of the value of add-ons at a dealer. Smart people will keep a wide berth of this dealership.  ",1.4

19,"February 11, 2015","My husband and I went to Randall Noe Subaru to look at a Forester. We were also shopping at another dealership, but we wanted to check out this particular vehicle before making our decision. We had our two small children with us, so we were trying to be quick with our decision. Immediately after arriving, we asked our salesperson, Ryan, if we could take a test drive. He didn't let us test drive it right away, he asked us to come inside, so that he could ask us some questions first. He then tried to qualify us with his questions. We explained that we would be paying cash, that we would be buying a vehicle that day, either from Randall Noe or another Subaru dealership in the metroplex. Eventually, he let my husband test drive the car. He completely failed to mention the hail damage on the vehicle, or that the vehicle had been in an accident, until my husband examined the front bumper and it fell off of the car. The fact that the vehicle's condition wasn't disclosed was concerning. When we sat down to negotiate the price, he asked us about financing, despite the fact that we insisted we would be paying cash. We told him that the price would have to be worked on before we would make a deal. So he left, for FIFTEEN minutes, to come back and talk to us about payments. When we explained AGAIN that we would be paying cash, he finally told us that the price was non-negotiable. Our experience was awful and we ended up purchasing our Subaru later that day from another dealership. If Ryan would actually listen to his customers and not be such an arrogant, slimy jerk, he would have made a sale that day. I will say that there was another employee working with him, who was actually quite pleasant, but we couldn't recall his name. But Ryan was an absolute xxxxxxx.",1.0
20,"August 03, 2014","I recently was in the market with my wife to purchase a 2015 Subaru Outback. I met Paul Jackmann and Michael B at Subaru of Denton dealership as my salesmen to help me out purchase a Subaru. They both were very nice. When we went into the dealership, they greeted both me and my wife well, explained everything about the Subaru to us and gave us a very nice test drive tour of both the Outback and Foresster. We worked with 5 other dealerships in the area (including Randall Noe in Terrell, TX) to find the best possible price on the 2015 Subaru Outback 2.5i limited. Paul/Mike were very adamant on the prices. They would not budge on the prices at all. When we got the best deal with Randall Noe and told both about it, they seemed to take a don't care attitude and started bad mouthing Randall Noe of misrepresentation and swindling their customers. 

Yesterday (Sat), we went to Randall Noe to purchase our Subaru. Our experience with Randall Noe has been wonderful day #1. The salesman there sent us all the estimates + drive out prices (including TT&L) in writing via email and later on even sent us the buyer's agreement showing the total drive out price clearly. She also took multiple calls from us, answered all of our questions and assured us multiple times they are not going to surprise us with hidden costs etc. Well, that was indeed true when we went to pick up car from them. It was a smooth, pleasant experience. Both their sales and financial folks did not pressure us and we were out in 2 hours from the dealership driving back with our new Subaru home!!

I am quite surprised and shocked at such horrible, negative tactics played by Subaru of Denton, Plano or Mckinney by bad mouthing other dealerships just to be able to gouge their customers by charging more. They tout of customer service and care. I laugh at that because I was going to pay them 2,000 extra $ for the car thus pleasing their pocket and getting screwed myself in the end.

So my message would be go to Subaru of Denton/McKinney/Plano to test drive the car and learn about the car but go to Randall Noe to buy the car. They will cut you the best deal. Go to Subaru of Denton/Plano/Mckinney if you have too much money growing on the tree and are looking to throw it in the lake or it is not your hard earned money.",4.5
21,"January 30, 2013","I'm active duty Airforce serving our nation at Barksdale AFB Louisiana. This is the closest subaru dealer to my duty station. After finding and agreeing on a price/trade-in on a 2011 subaru outback (Sears and the used car team were great!!), we went to close the deal. I wanted to title and register this vehicle in Illinois. I am an Illinois resident that's my home of record where I hold my drivers license and other vehicle registrations. This is where the problems started. Like I said I'm AD military. It was late on a Saturday so Tim Bell the F & I guy let us take the car home because he was lost doing an out of state registration or because he didn't want to deal with it so late in the day. We then drove 3.5 hours back to Shreveport. We returned the following Monday. Tim was very short with us, he continued to bash USAA (who we had pre approved financing with) and was very negative about what needed to be done in order to register the car in IL. We sat around waiting only to have him come back 30 min later and tell us Randall Noe was no longer interested in the sale. He ended the conversation by walking away while I was still conversing with him. Titling the car out of state was too much work for him, thanks for supporting our troops Tim. Maybe next time I go to work I'll say fixing military aircraft is too much work and xxxx with freedom, not! Because that's not the type of peson I am, I wish Randall Noe felt the same. So pretty much I wasted 7 hours of driving and gas just to be told that Tim and Randall noe subaru wouldn't spend a few extra minutes to help our uniformed military members. Thanks for nothing Randall Noe.",1.4
