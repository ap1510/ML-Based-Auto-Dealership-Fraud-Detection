0,"June 24, 2020","I just bought a Lincoln Nautilus from Sandy Small.  I am a retired Master Sargent from the Air Force and have purchased many cars in my lifetime from all over the world.  Never have I experienced the customer service I received from Sandy.  Some car salespeople have high levels of business efficiency, others have high levels of personable warmth but few can pull off both.  Sandy was highly efficient, yet with that southern hospitality that made me feel like family - not just a customer.  Kudos to you Sandy!!!!!",5.0
1,"June 22, 2020","If a Lincoln is on your list of next car purchases, go see Casper. Casper and his team provide 5-Star service, answer all your questions, stay after if needed and let you come in on your schedule not theirs. The shopping experience for a new Lincoln doesn't get any better than North Park Lincoln. Excellent!!",5.0
2,"June 19, 2020","I recently purchased a vehicle this past weekend from North Park Lincoln, and it was by far the BEST EXPERIENCE I have ever had at a dealership! This is my second car purchase, but I’ve had 3 cars in total. Joe Lopez was outstanding and went above and beyond during my visit. He made this process stress-free by taking the time to answer ALL of my questions and making sure my fiancé and I were comfortable and accommodated during our visit. He was also very professional, knowledgeable, and friendly! I will definitely be back when I’m due for a new vehicle!",5.0
3,"June 06, 2020","Wow! Impressed with salesperson, Matthew Uresti. Very knowledgeable about Lincoln vehicles. I told him what I was looking for and the second crossover I saw became mine. The finance department was thorough in explaining everything right down to courtesy pick up for maintenance with an appointment. 
Thank you Matt and North Park Lincoln for making my purchase stress free.

5,"May 27, 2020","Our experience with Casper was outstanding! He made my husband, myself, and our 8 year old daughter feel welcome from the beginning! He genuinely cares about his customers and for the first time in being at a car dealership, we did not feel pressured! Even the extremely sweet lady at the front desk, Casey? printed out coloring sheets for our daughter! Even though we decided to not purchase a vehicle at this time, we will definitely recommend Casper and NorthPark Lincoln to all of friends and family.

7,"April 19, 2020","so .. I am a 24 year old from Houston. and it was definitely worth it. I worked With Kasper and it was an in and out deal. A great value and awesome service. You can see everyone surprised that a young lady like myself just bought a '17 Lincoln Continental  and all thanks to Kasper and his team. No words can describe the happiness I have for getting the car I ALWAYSSSS WANTED :D

12,"March 19, 2020","Joe Lopez worked with me to get into a 2016 MKC lease 3 years ago. As lease end approached this month, I found a 2019 Hyundai Santa Fe Ultimate on the Kahlig Auto website, but the vehicle was located in San Juan, Tx. Joe arranged for the vehicle to be brought to San Antonio within 2 days for me to test drive then buy. I called Joe for this 2nd purchase from NP Lincoln because I appreciated his professionalism, genuine kind and helpful manner, and overall knowledge of the vehicles I was interested in. Today I also met Amy Martinez in the finance department and had an excellent experience as well. Amy explained the financing process in a clear and professional manner. Another great car buying experience!",5.0
13,"March 05, 2020","Our greatest car buying experience by far!! Worked out the complete deal with Casper from our home in Florida. When we arrived, Dalton was waiting for  us at the airport. We then spent less than an hour at the dealership before driving off in our dream Black Label Continental.  Everything was prepared and perfect. This is one first class, top notch dealership!! We will definitely be back for our next Lincoln.",5.0

17,"January 24, 2020","I recently bought my first Lincoln...a 2019 MKC.  The entire experience was positive and pleasant.  My sales consultant was Matthew Uresti.  There aren’t enough words to express how impressed I was by this young man.  He was knowledgeable, informative, and professional.  I never felt pressured or rushed, and he answered all of my questions and concerns with the utmost patience and care.  I look forward to doing business with him again and will recommend him to all of my family and friends.",5.0

19,"January 22, 2020", My husband and I recently purchased a Lincoln MKX and were undecided whether we wanted to trade in our vehicle or keep it and purchase the MKX without trade. Both Matthew Uresti and Matt Barrientes were very patient and offered us both scenarios. Very impressed when the transaction was completed. Thank you to both “Matts” and Amy Martinez in the business office. ,5.0
20,"January 16, 2020",Casper was amazing eager and willing to show us any car we might be interested in and make sure we had an enjoyable experience in choosing the right one. Our experience in buying my MKC with Casper and his side kick Dalton work well together to get things going. We are very satisfied with the service we received from Casper and the dealership with our trade in and vehicle delivery process going smoothly.,5.0
21,"January 16, 2020","We recently went into North Park Lincoln to look at the MKCs. We were helped by Casper Kasperski, and the entire experience could not have gone more seamlessly. He listened to exactly what we were looking for....he listened to what we were wanting to pay, and he made it happen. There wasn't a long drawn out negotiation. It was painless! I would recommend Casper and the North Park Lincoln dealership to anyone who is looking for a new car. They are AWESOME!",5.0
22,"January 16, 2020","Kent Kasperski was our first connection with North Park Lincoln.  We had been looking for a new Lincoln for quite some time and had recently broadened out search outside of Houston.  Kent was so nice and made us feel in good hands from the first moment on.

However, I do feel like the finance guy, who we signed all of our paperwork with (I cannot remember his name),  was a bit pushy and a bit dishonest when explaining some of the additional adding of financial options.

Overall, it was a good experience.

Thank you!

23,"January 12, 2020","On January 30, 2019, I decided to lease a Lincoln to take advantage of the end of year incentives.  I walked into  North Park Lincoln Mercury in San Antonio without an appointment and was lucky to get Casper Caspersky as my salesperson.  Being a woman of 75+ in age, I was anxious about being taken advantage of.  I had been listening to the Carpro show on the radio for some time and had planned to use their VIP method for the purchase  but had run out of time.  Casper found a Lincoln MKZ that fit all  requirements for what I was looking for in a new car at lease payments I wanted to make.  I don't see how the car buying experience could have been better had I used the Carpro VIP method.  Casper and his assistant Dalton helped me with an orientation on how to use the many features included on the car.  Dalton even helped me with issues I was having with my iPhone.  I couldn't recommend anyone more highly than Casper and his assistant.

27,"December 18, 2019","Billy W was my salesman.  He has been incredibly amazing.   I never felt pressured to buy, he was knowledgeable about their products, and has been in touch after the sale to assure my satisfaction.   I love my car, and would highly recommend Billy W.  North Park is blessed to have Billy on their team.   ",5.0
28,"December 06, 2019","I wish I could include a picture of our certified preowned (CPO) 2015, $40,000+ car, sitting on a tow truck in our driveway--less than a year after we bought it at the North Park Lincoln. This is actually the 2nd time the car wouldn't start and had to be repaired. There was also a battery terminal issue they admitted to missing in the CPO inspection, causing the 1st issue with our car, less than TWO DAYS after purchase.
We paid more than $1,100 for the most recent repair, not shockingly it wasn't covered under the CPO warranty.  After being towed to the dealership, they couldn't even diagnose it for 8 days, and initially told us they didn't have any loaner cars. In the end, we got a smaller loaner car that wouldn't fit all 3 of our car seats.
Manager Trey Horner assured us that he would take care of us, ""Mr Kahlig was involved,"" they were going to help us trade it in for a better car, on and on .... Over a month later, they haven't even had the decency to call me back.
In my opinion, this dealership is no better than any smarmy used car shop you pass on the side of the road--and Trey and the rest of the staff are dishonest and only looking to sell you something. I will tell everyone I possibly can, for the rest of my life, how awful an experience we've had with Trey, this dealership, and the Kahlig auto group. Hopefully others can avoid the frustration, and wasted money, that we've experienced.",1.0
29,"November 27, 2019","I recently bought a used Porsche from North Park Lincoln and it was a great experience.  Casper Kasperski and Dalton took care of my every need, and spent as much time with me as I needed.  They were very pleasant and knowledgeable.   The  purchase process was very efficient and smooth.  I bought from out of state and they took care of all Colorado paperwork and taxes.  The dealership is very high quality and I highly recommend Casper.

believe to be the ultimate in style and quality.  I called and visited with a gentleman

Within a day or two, I called back and bought the truck over the phone, sight unseen.

35,"October 06, 2019","We purchase a 2019 MKC from North Park Lincoln on 30 Sep 2019.  All of the personnel we dealt with from the Finance Depart and the Sales Representative, Matt were outstanding. We had three meetings with Matt prior to the purchase of our vehicle.  On each day, he was dressed in a suit and tie that were neat and very professional.  I told him that he will go far in life.  He was very polite and professional.  Beside giving us an in-depth review on all aspects of the MKC and all the technical aspects to me and my wife his speech was clear and gave me the confidence he know what he was talking about .  He was very well organized.  He also told us that at anytime in the future he would be available to assist us on any of the technical feature on the Lincoln MKC.

40,"August 21, 2019","I was a well motivated buyer, having previously owned a 2000 and then a 2008 Navigator, I knew the quality of the product. So I did not need much convincing that I was making the right decision to purchase this extraordinary vehicle. But, I appreciated very much the thoroughness of our discussions about the vehicle that solidified the soundness of my decision to purchase a previously owned 2018 Navigator. They were professional and thoughtful and made the whole process very easy and comfortable. Also, I must mention C-Rod (Chris) who assisted in the financing and provided most useful and necessary information about the vehicle. He contributed a great deal to a a very pleasant experience. Kahlig has fielded a great team. Thank you..",5.0

They were patient, attentive, and even came to our home multiple times to make the even process more convenient so we could test out various SUV configutations with car seats ( twins on the way) and our two young boys. We ultimately decided on a 2019 Navigator Reserve which is easily one of the nicest vehicles we've owned. I would highly recommend this team and this vehicle to anyone in the market. ",5.0
48,"June 04, 2019","I have been buying cars from North Park Lincoln for several years now. From the very first car I bought, the service has been awesome. When I buy, I always go Kent (Casper) Kasperski for all of my car needs. I tell Casper what I want and he goes out his way to get it. I love NP Lincoln and I love working with Kent (Casper) Kasperski. He always goes out his way. He’s very personable and we have built a friendship. I am no longer just a buyer but a repeat buyer. If you’re looking for a Lincoln, ask for Casper. You won’t be disappointed. ",5.0
49,"May 29, 2019","This was easily the most effortless car buying experience that I've ever had and I attribute nearly all of this to my car salesman, Jim Blair. Just as I was about to purchase at my local dealership in Austin, I spoke with Jim on the phone and he convinced me to take the trip to San Antonio and I couldn't be any happier with that decision.

53,"April 14, 2019","I have been servicing my car at North Park Lincoln for the last 4 years and I can't say enough great things about the service department. Zach Perez is the best Ford/Lincoln service advisor around and I would recommend him and his team to anyone looking to service their car or truck. He has on many occasions gone above and beyond what I would've expected of a dealership service adviser. Every visit I was only there for a short time because Zach always had vehicle ready for me free of charge when I arrived (only available if you have Premium Care). In my experience almost all dealerships I have visited had horrible service departments that don't care about the customer or value your time or money. While no service department is without issue North Park Lincoln is as close to perfect as you're going to find anywhere around. Once or twice when there was a small problem with the service(s) performed both of service directors, Chuck and Gary went out of their way to make sure that I was taken care of and my car was back in tip top condition in no time. If you ever need servicing for your car just ask for Zach! ",5.0
54,"April 13, 2019",Casper was very prompt and courteous throughout the purchasing process. He handled an interstate sale in a patient and professional manner including allowing me time to have the vehicle shipped to my location in Wisconsin. The vehicle is pretty much what I expected. Thanks again. Bob Kelly,4.6
55,"April 02, 2019",Went to North Park to buy a car that could be towed behind my new RV for a forthcoming trip out West. Selected a 2019 Nautilus because it could be towed flat instead of on a dolly. Took it to my RV repair shop to have the tow rig mounted and discovered that neither Blue Ox nor Road Master had a base plate that would fit without damaging the cars bumper. They would not have a base plate designed until well after I left on my trip. My salesman found a new 2018 MKX that could be fitted and made the trade. Great team effort!,5.0

69,"October 23, 2018","Today I visited North Park Lincoln, test drove a 2018 lincoln MKC & was thoroughly impressed first of all by the calibre & professionalism of 2 gentlemen who assisted me - Casper Kasperski & Isaac Loera. The level of professionalism & courtesy of these 2 gentleman was only equaled by the composed, quiet & supremely refined ride of the MKC I test drove. Far too often folks only leave comments when displeased however after my experience with this dealership I can say that politeness & professionalism coupled with phenomenal cars are North Park Lincoln's area of specialty. This dealership & car brand are now at the TOP of my list!!!.",5.0
70,"October 13, 2018","Do not believe North Park’s hype.  Their customer service is subpar at best and dishonest at worst.  If I could give them negative stars for service I would.  I don’t think I’ve had a single good experience with this car sales/service company.  They advertise a lie saying they have excellent customer service in an attempt to convince people to spend more with their company.

The Takata airbag recall started this off.  I put a detailed Yelp review in about that.  The managers tried to fix the initial dishonesty of their service employee and onsite Hertz rental personnel.  In fact, I almost thought about removing my review.

However, while we had the rental I have had continued bad experiences in having to come back to the Lincoln dealership once a month to renew the contract. Doing this is a complete waste of my time.  It boggles the mind how the renewal process can't be done over the phone.  Even this I put off to bad service by Hertz and considered removing my bad review.

Then, the part comes in to fix the deadly airbags.  We get a call to turn in my wife's Lincoln MKX.  She does.  She gets another call from a service rep telling her to come pick up the car, that it is ready to be picked up.  The service dude even tells her he will make certain they have her car pulled out and ready to go.  I stay home from my Son's track meet so I can go pick it up.

I go to pick it up today and am about to leave when I notice a box sitting in the front passenger seat of my wife's Lincoln MKX.  It is the airbag.  Her glove box is disassembled and lying on the passenger floorboard.

Why would they tell my wife her car was ready to pick up and then not have it ready?  What a waste of my time.  At least my family enjoyed their time at the track meet while mine was wasted by North Park Lincoln.",1.0

86,"June 18, 2018","We buy my wife a used 2008 Lincoln MKX. A month after buying the car she receives a recall notice about airbags in the car. North Park tell her they don’t have the recall replacement parts but they will call when they get it.

A year later, another recall letter. This one says, ""The Lincoln Motor Company previously sent you a letter notifying you of an important safety recall on your vehicle's front passenger airbag inflator. Lincoln continues to work closely with our supplier's to produce the needed parts for this repair. Until parts are available to repair your vehicle, Lincoln is offering to pay for the use of a rental vehicle as a means of alternate transportation. When parts become available, The Lincoln Motor Company will notify you via mail to schedule your FREE airbag recall repair with your dealer. Parts are anticipated to become available during the second and third quarters of 2018. If you require a rental vehicle while waiting for parts to become available for your vehicle, please contact your local Ford or Lincoln dealer.""

She shows me the new letter. I wonder whay the offer for rental and think it must be a very serious problem. I check the recall. The airbags explode on their own, or in minor wrecks and kill or seriously maim people with flying metal pieces. One woman had the artery in her neck slashed open by her airbag. She bled to death. I also heard the driver side airbag sua sponte explodes periodically.

I immediately called the service line at North Park and am told they do not have the parts. I explain I understand and ask for a rental.  The North Park service rep on the phone tells me I can’t bring it in for two days because the person who handles the recalls won't be in until then. I tell her I'll be there in the morning.

I show up the next morning.  The first person tells me they cannot help me because they don’t have the parts. I say fine, I’ll take a rental. He says he can’t. I read the letter to him, and ask for the rental. He speaks with a Service Lead and comes back and says no. I ask to speak with the Service Lead. The Service Lead tells me I have to wait for the part. I tell him fine, get my wife a rental. He says no, they only supply the rental when we bring the vehicle in for the actual recall repair and they won’t have the part but will call me when they do. I read him the letter, and explain the airbags kill people. I tell him that is probably why Lincoln sent the letter allowing us a rental so they don't have to pay billions in wrongful death claims and even more in NHTSA fines. He tells me no. I say, let me speak to your boss.

His boss shows up.  The same thing, not parts, no rental until the part comes in and we turn the car in for repair. She say I to make an appointment and I will get notice when a part comes in. I read to her the letter. She tries to tell me I am misunderstanding the letter.

I tell her to give me a letter on North Park Lincoln letterhead explaining every excuse I was told by her and the other service reps and lead. I ask her to include in the letter that North Park has no parts available to make the recall repair, how the recall notice letter I have says no rental is allowed for my wife until a part comes in, and to have my wife and children ride in a car with the faulty airbags. I tell her to give me something in writing that says what she just told me and I will drive away. She tells me no, she won't put that in writing.
She goes inside and, I assume, speaks with someone else while I make a phone call to a number she provided. I get hung up on by a machine. I look up the recall phone number on my own and am on hold when the North Park rep walks back up.

She now says they can fit the car in next Wednesday, a week and half away. I ask why she told me they did not have the part for the repair. She says, “I never told you that.”, as if I can’t remember the conversation we just had moments before. I blow that off and say, “ok, where do you want me to leave the vehicle until the recall repair is made?” She tells me I am not leaving the vehicle there but I am to bring it back on Wednesday. We then go over the letter in my hand again.

She asks me why it is so urgent all of a sudden.  She says the recall has been going on for 2 or 3 years. I explain this is the first letter I read, tell her I had no idea this was the Takatta airbag recall to fix airbags that kill people, explain how my son, my wife and myself have ridden in this vehicle not knowing the danger. She tells me to just drive without someone in the passenger side of the vehicle, the airbag is safe in the driver side.  I decide to not explain to her about the lady getting her throat cut was the driver of the vehicle. Instead I point out to this is a family car, and ask where should the passenger sit, in the hatchback section?

She then tells me, well Hertz has no rental cars and won’t until Wednesday. She says Hertz is bringing vehicles in from Brownsville and I will have to wait to get the rental. This upsets me, but I stay calm and ask confirm that she is telling me Hertz has no cars in all of San Antonio, Texas they can rent me? She says yes. I say that is a lie. I call and reserve a rental at the De Zavala Hertz location. It takes me about 2 minutes.

She is surprised to hear I reserved a rental. She says I have to pay for it out of pocket and get reimbursed. I ask her to put that in writing and she does.

It is my opinion the service personnel at North Park Lincoln tried to do everything in their power to avoid making the recall repair and or supply my wife with a rental. If I was someone unwilling to stick to my guns the lies would have worked. I am truly disappointed that I was lied to about the Hertz rental availability as well. Maybe North Park treats other people better than me, but with me, they failed miserably to provide the service they claim to provide their customers. I will never buy a Lincoln again, and I will never go to North Park Lincoln again once the recall repair is done, if the recall repair is ever done at all.",1.2
87,"June 15, 2018","Brought vehicle in back in October to have all service that was due at 100k (brakes, transmission, filters, a/c, etc) they had the vehicle for 4 days and didn't do the requested service work. So I brought it in back about 2 weeks ago for an oil change the service advisor tells me they need to do a transmission flush, and A/C I questioned why they didn't do it when I requested it last visit for them to tell me it wasn't on the service ticket. Well about 10 to maybe 15 minutes later the service advisor comes to tell me there is a leak in the transmission and it's likely to be a costly repair. At this point I believe they saw the leak back in October and chose not to do the work because it was still under warranty and now it is not. ",2.6

 As soon as I made my first call North Park followed up and made this one of my easiest purchases ever. The sales staff and the finance manager had the car ready as soon as I drove up and the test drive and purchase was completed withing 2 hours! (I should add that I talked to both Lincoln dealers in the area and they would not price match and/or make a similar offer)
 Unfortunately I got the car home and received a warning light within 400 miles of initial driving. We were destroyed! North Park offered to drive to Corpus and pick up the car (150 miles!) and they gave me a brand new loaner MKT! North Park replaced a control module, washed the car and drove it back to Corpus.

106,"May 27, 2017","About 4 weeks ago I purchased a used 2011 Cadillac from North Park Used, which is part of the North Park dealership.  This review isn't about North Park New, but about North Park Used.  I would stay away from them at all cost.  As I stated, I purchase the car 4 weeks ago, I have driven the vehicle a total of about 25 miles and haven't seen it since they came a towed it away.  I drove the vehicle from their lot to Flemings steak house, came out after a meal and the vehicle wouldn't start, about 40 minutes later at 10pm, it started and I got it home.  Next morning, vehicle didn't start, called the dealer they sent a tow truck.  They said they were taking it to their Garage or Cadillac.  It didn't make it to a North Park garage, it was some one off fly by night place. They messed with the vehicle for a couple of days then figured a way to by-pass all the security feature and got it started, drove it to the Cadillac dealer and told don't shut if off it won't start again.  The Cadillac took a week to troubleshoot the vehicle finding that the TCM needed to be replace.  North Park had told me on the phone they were going to have the Cadillac dealer repair it, that wasn't the case. The fly by night garage came and got the vehicle, order the part and then ask the shop manager, how to install the park.  The fly-by-night installed the part, but, because they didn't have the right equipment couldn't set the new TCM and reprogram the vehicle to the part.  The vehicle was then towed back to the Cadillac dealer to fix. So in talking with the Cadillac dealer I find out that the fly-by-night that North Park uses, was removing panels and things that didn't need to be.  There was also a new Headlight assembly that was going to be installed.  North Park again told me that everything would be done by the Cadillac dealer.  I called the Cadillac Dealer and spoke with the shop manager, come to find out that was not the case again.  After the Cadillac dealer had the car running the Fly-by-Night came got the car to install the headlamp assembly.  I was kept in the dark by North Park, really bad customer experience.  I still don't have the car, I have to go and pick it up, rather than North Park delivering it.  So if you out looking for a used car, stay away from North Park used car on I35 in San Antonio.

My wife and I recommend the team @ North Park Lincoln for anyone that is shopping for your next new vehicle… no matter what your price range is.  
Great Experience and Good people!!!

Since I would be making a trip from Austin, I confirmed with him they still had it and made an appointment to see it no more than 2 hours later.  I showed up at the agreed time where he was busy showing that exact car to someone else.  He asked me to wait while he took the other person on a test drive.  Obviously, I was no longer interested in doing business with them at this point.  If I am willing to make a commitment to travel a couple of hours to view a vehicle, I would expect a professional dealership to reciprocate the commitment by honoring an appointment.  Extremely unprofessional. I highly recommend going elsewhere.",1.2

After the purchase, he always got back to me immediately when I had questions. Elliot sat with me and answered questions the next day before I drove it off the lot (they kept it a day to make sure it was thoroughly cleaned), and told me not to hesitate to contact him should I have more. Amy in financing was so great to work with. She's patient and explains everything very well, especially when you don't much about financing.

My experience started with what looked to be a disappointment at 1st when i arrived, but quickly was explained and a resolution made that turned this into an experience that was far greater then the expectation originally set by myself. I found a huge focus on customer satisfaction, along with moral factors set that makes this dealership one of the top on my list for the final outcome of a vehicle purchase and feeling happy and confidant of my decision to buy from this dealership (coming from a person who hates dealerships, and having a car problem purchasing about 30+ cars so far in life), I know i was impressed!

142,"March 17, 2015","This 'used car' purchase experience certainly felt *new* to me. New because no used car purchase has never been so pleasurable as this one.

From the moment I drove up in the car I was to trade in to the moment I drove off in a new 'used' car', salesman Mark Trachta treated me as if I were part of the North Park family. 

We navigated the Kahlig website taking a look at all the cars available. There were  a number of superb choices, but we managed to select a few that peaked my interest & I was allowed to go on multiple test drives until I decided on the car that satisfied all of my requirements. 

Once I decided on 'the car' the process to complete the sale progressed with great ease. Mark's manager James Puckett assessed the value of my trade-in & placed a very fair value on it which prompted completion of the deal.

Elliot was professional and attentive throughout the entire process. We never felt like we were wasting anyone's time buying a less expensive vehicle. He made sure to answer every question we had and took any of our concerns seriously. This was by far the best car buying experience we have ever had.

149,"January 01, 2015","I am a first time Lincoln owner after 48 years of driving and operating all manner of vehicles.  During my very first interaction and interest in buying a new car, a very busy showroom receptionist stopped and cheerfully greeted me.  She introduced me to a very polite sales person.  After quickly telling her my interest in the new 2015 Navigators, Sandy Small took me to her office.  Immediately, I knew I was in good hands, and by the wall of accolades and many of the 200+ yearly sales awards, she obviously new how to make a deal! By the way, I later calculated the total of her sales to be in excess of 2,600 vehicles.  After providing my desires and options, she immediately investigated the inventory, not coming up with a most desirable match.  She began examining her probably obvious to her, but not too me, avenues to locate a better match.  Why you may ask, and state her obvious chores... it was the manner in which she did it.  She flittered about quickly through out the entire process making things come together for me and what I wanted-- not what they had, or what they wanted to sell!  This has been many a misfortune and time wasted effort I have endured in past buying experiences.

Sandy spent enormous time and effort acquainting me to the Navigator, the dealership and to Bill Anderson my Service Advisor.  He acquainted me with the service procedures and scheduling process.

I have owned many Ford products in the past, the last over six years ago.  The technologies in the vehicles have come a very long way since then.  What I really like is the online Ford customer account where you can view videos, explanations and ""how to do"" or use the various features of your car.  It provides updates availability via email on my vehicle.

Sandy Small is the most knowledgeable and diligent sales person I have ever worked with!!! Truly first-class lady and best sales person in my many auto buying experience.

THIS week, my ignition had to be replaced along with the battery (from juicing a faulty ignition); cost - $1,000.00. I asked the service manager about the key. The service manager told me I would still use the original key and a 2nd key would cost about $200.  I told him about the 2nd key thing when I purchased the car. He transferred me to used cars, explained the situation...again. They told me they would have the original salesman call me back. I got a call about making an appointment...what? My car is already at the dealership, I was merely inquiring about the 2nd key I was promised 2 years ago and their intention of honoring that promise. So...Used Cars ""passed the buck"" back to Service. I explained the situation...yet again. Service gave me the number to the original salesman. Question?

(MY car has always been serviced  - superbly - by Lincoln but this was my first visit at this Dealership since I just recently moved to SA).    After service the car was washed but apparently with my telescoping antenna out…When I got home I noticed the gross deformity of my antenna and contacted my Svc Advisor, Mr. Andrews.   He texted me back and assured me it will be taken care of and an antenna will be ordered.   Waited for weeks and periodically inquired with Mr. Andrews but was completely blown off.   Finally sent a message to Mr. Sanders, the Svc Mgr.   He took action immediately and I was scheduled for an antenna replacement.   On the 18th of Dec when I met up with Mr. Andrews again, he apologized for “dropping the ball” and assured me a certified technician will be changing my antenna.    When I picked up the car I rushed home and parked it.  (I only drive the Lincoln on special occasions; we have two other cars).   Few days later I sold the car to a good friend of mine and I left for an out of town trip.   When I came back, I ran into my friend who marveled how good the car is but told me the antenna would not retract and the radio cannot be turned off!

While we were there waiting to have a car brought around for us to drive, the salesman told us we would need to wait while he talked to some people who had just driven in.  We just got in our car and left.  We are heading to Austin to buy.",1.0

Great experience we arrived at 12:30 to look around, test drove a few, then out the door with my wife's new car at 4:30.

                       I just bought a used car from your IH35 location, now I love the car I bought from you and I spent 10,000 dollars with you,now that may not be alot of money to you but it is to me. What I have a problem with is that when I was leaving your dealership I was handed my keys to my new purchase and was told 1 key will start your car and the other will not, I have since found out its going to cost me a 100 dollar bill to fix the problem which it has to be programed to start the car. I just wish that was told to me before I signed the papers because that would have made a difference. Honesty is the best policy I think!!!! Where's the pickel guys, should have made it right but didn't even offer that!! when I asked about why I wasn't told that, the comment was made I could have only gave you 1 key!!!! Anyway lesson learned!!!! Won't make that mistake again!!!          ",1.7
