0,"March 09, 2020",Don’t trust their service department. They will lie to your face and accuse you of not following recommended service intervals (even when they have done ALL THE SERVICE SINCE NEW!) I wonder if it was worth it for them to lose a customer that buys a new truck every two years just to try to get an extra $250 out of me?? ,1.0
1,"January 04, 2020","I would not recommend this dealership! We went in to purchase a 2019 Acadia which was listed online at $26,388. Went in and verified the price plus TT&L. Went for a test drive and came back to negotiate. We were then told we HAD to trade-in my car. We told them initially we would trade it in depending on the deal. They ultimately came back with a trade-in offer $5,500 below what we received on the same day at a different dealership. They have since changed the price on their website. If I could I would give them zero stars. ",1.0
2,"December 08, 2019","Treated with contempt and disrespect.  Inquired about a lease, received questions from salesman I thought he should know.  When I said it was sad he did not know, he did not respond but his supervisor (Trevor) did respond with a DISRESPECTFUL and offensive E-mail.  Stay away from this dealer if you want good customer service.",1.0
3,"May 10, 2019","I purchased a 2016 GMC Acadia Denali from Gateway Buick GMC. I came with my own financing & purchased late one weekday evening. I didn't realize until the next day that they gave me two key fobs but only one key. First problem! I called my sell's guy the next day. He's unable to provide a free second key, that'll be $50. Wow! Not even a full 24 hours later and I can't get a 2nd key to my $30k truck! Here's the good part, 3 days later it rains and all of the shiny stuff washes off my tires. I notice a nail in the side wall of the rear driver side and that all 4 are really worn. I called the service manager & was told once you drive it off the lot, we're not responsible. I took it in to THEIR service department the next day and asked if they think the tires need to be replaced. They said if not today, definitely at your next oil change, which in this case will be MY FIRST! I still have several thousand miles before my first oil change as the truck's not even a month old. But needless to say I will have to purchase $800 tires. Please stay away from this dealership! I got my dream truck but I'm not sure how these tires passed any factory safety inspection, as the truck is still under factory warranty! Please go to Sewell. I literally had an Enclave on hold at Sewell and opted for the Acadia - Denali my dream car at Gateway. You cannot beat customer service, which Sewell Buick GMC Dallas has always provided me. I also experienced the bait switch here! Came in because of an internet price on an Enclave and happen to see my dream vehicle which wasn't on their website at the time. Please spend your time and money elsewhere, consider yourself warned. I think its reasonable to expect a certified used car that's undergone a 26 point safety inspection, to have reasonably new tires, when you drive it off the lot. The wear on these tires would've been a deal breaker, had I noticed in the light of day!",2.2
4,"January 01, 2019","Eddie Vargas the general manager of GatewayGMC offer bad service. I visited 4 other GMC dealerships and they value my trade in over $17k but Mr. Vargas was devaluating my trade in, he also did not wanted to sale me a car from his dealership even do I already have been approved for $49k. from my bank. The sales agent was great but the general manager offer bad service at all times. ",1.0
5,"December 07, 2018",I drove over an hour because of two internet prices they had posted.  Their  saleman knew I was coming to see these two vehicles. They raised the price thousands of dollars and would not honor their posted prices.  This is a true BAIT AND SWITCH.  They expect you to just accept the higher price and close the deal.  The Dallas Attorney General needs to look into this business.  They are ripping off the general public and no one is doing anything to stop it.,1.7
6,"December 07, 2018",Got a quote in writing set up appointment to look at vehicle. Dealer called night before the appointment and twice morning of appointment to make sure I was coming. Drove over an hour and vehicle wasn't there. Said owners flew in and where driving it. Voiced my disapproval and left. Called them to see if they could send pictures and deliver the car. After several phone calls and picture sending they send me the numbers and the quote was $1800 more than the original one that I have in writing. Blamed the manufacturer and wouldn't honor the original written quote which was advertised on their website. BAD BUSINESS!,1.0
7,"September 22, 2018","Women BEWARE! Gateway was THE WORST dealership I’ve ever dealt with. I went alone since my husband had to work thinking it wouldn’t be that bad but I was WAY WRONG! First round of negotiations with Bill and his finance team they started out with the MRSP price. I told them no, here is the advertised sale price and that’s where we start. Bill didn’t seem to like that.. maybe he didn’t think I did my homework on the truck.. so he went back to his finance guy & came back but had added in ridiculous fees and low balled my trade. I told Bill no, that wasn’t going to work and try again. He snickered at me, shook his head and said things like “it’s just simple math”. He went back again and he came back with an even more ridiculous offer- Bill and his team at Gateway obviously didn’t take me as a serious buyer. I’m sure if my husband had been with me, he wouldn’t have treated me that way, saying thing like “maybe it’s too much car for you”. But this NIGHTMARE gets better.. when leaving I asked why they gave me such a low offer on my trade..Bill told me it was in excellent condition except for that long scratch down the drivers side. I was shocked to go outside and sure enough they had put a 24 inch scratch down the drivers side door which WAS NOT there when I drove it in! Extremely upset, Bill told me “yes it was there, Amy”. Back and forth he was arguing with me outside the dealership until I just LOST IT!! Then all of a sudden he gets a magic solution and buffs it out!!! Never in my life have I seen a tactic like this used to low ball my trades! It was some type of black rubber compound to make it look and feel like there was a deep scratch on it. No apologies from Bill he just said “it must have rubbed up against something back there.” So upset at how I was treated I told my husband who emailed there general manager Jamie Juarez, with no response from him either. So save yourself money and a big headache and drive a little further down to HERITAGE GMC in Rockwall. They reasonably negotiated with me, gave me $3k MORE for my trade and I got exactly what I wanted!! 
This incident happened 9/5/18- and never heard a single response from them so this must happen often with this dealership. I know companies pay for reviews but this one is for FREE! I would like to tell Bill, Jamie and the finance manager that yes I do know how to do “simple math” I am a CVICU nurse so I use “simple math” daily and I would LOVE to send you a copy of my bill of sale from Heritage GMC Rockwall so you can see exactly what you laughed at.

8,"November 05, 2016","Brad has went out of his way to ensure I get the type of vehicle that best fit my taste. I will recommend Gateway Buick to all my relatives and friends. He did not hassle me, he was honest with me, he worked hard for me to get approved today with his Finance Team. I truly do appreciate his courtesy and sensitivity to my needs, not needs of the company but to making the customer HAPPY. I feel thus far that Buick is my new car family.

10,"September 15, 2015","I bought a 2014 Sierra from these guys. After I purchased it I noticed a vibration in the rear end at highway speeds and also when your driving and let off the gas. I have spoken to the service department several times on this matter. They always gave me the run around one of the older service guys even told me to replace the exhaust ! With that being said I did and that still did not resolve the issue. So I did research on this and found lots of people where having the same issue online. Well the other night my drive shaft snapped in half. The service department is now giving me the run around and are now trying to put the blame on me ! Even tho this problem was there from the time I bought the truck. The service department manager and one of his team members were both trying to team up on me on the phone pretty much telling me I was at fault !
I do not recommend this place due to the fact they will do everything they can not to warranty there vehicles. I still have not heard back from them on my truck and it's just sitting there. Bad customer service. 9/15 Update Gateway Buick GMC Did not honor there warranty !!! THIS LOT IS A CROOK ! THEY ARE MAKING ME FIX A TRUCK THAT WAS DEFECTIVE OUT OF MY OWN POCKET ",1.0
11,"July 26, 2015","Bought a Buick lacrosse used 2011 back in 2013 
From the very beginning I felt like I was pressured into a quick decision from my sales person Robert Pope .After buying the car I had a death in my family made a road trip home discovered the tires was 3 different brands all warn out to different degrees 2 was worn below the legal limit . I was told this at another Buick dealer ship in miss.that I took the car to because the tires thump so bad on the trip .I got back in town went straight there to gateway they would only replace one tire .Also I had mentioned the car would not change gears properly I felt like something was wrong with the transmission they did check it and said that it was fine .After there servicing my car the battery was dead I had to buy a new battery it has been one thing after another with this car now it's back at gateway in the shop and the transmission is out ..
And the price I paid for the car I could of bought a brand new car ,I'm very disappointed with gate way and Robert Pope. 
High pressure from the sales men Robert Pope resulted in me not knowing I maid a very bad deal for this car .

12,"April 15, 2015","Bought a used truck from the used car lot. After 2 paper tags and 3 months later. I found out the dealership never had tge title to sell it to begin with. The truck was on Cargurus for over 60 days. That gave them more than 6 months to get a title. I had to hire a lawyer. Then the dealership told me to file for a lost title. Um,I didnt lose the title and thats not what you sold me! After just under a year they gave me the money that i put down. Nevermind all the payments i made. They even tried to charge me a rental fee. No class! Will never go back to them again. Go to Classic Cherolet. Gateway says they got it? All but the title. Cost me thousands. You want to lose money go to Gateway. ",1.0
13,"March 03, 2015","There is only way to describe my experience at Gateway Buick/GMC and that would be excellent. Bill Lavender from the moment I told him that I would be needing a new vehicle and what I was looking he took control of the situation and within a day, he found the exact vehicle I wanted with exactly what I needed. Before I left with my new car, Bill ensured I understood how to use all different capabilities with OnStar, how to use the GMC navigation and how to set up my phone with the use of hands free. I must admit, the GMC is really user friendly and all of your controls can be done through voice commands which I love because you don't have to look around for things while you are driving and that is a huge safety factor. I love me car and it is fun to drive.

Gateway, you have a great asset in Bill Lavender, because he loves his job and it shows. He wants to ensure that you are happy. It is extremely noticeable, that he cares more about you than making the sell.  Because of Bill you have repeat family business with Gateway Buick/GMC.",5.0
14,"February 10, 2015","i went to buy a truck for my husband did the deal and took it home and my husband got up on the freeway and the transmission goes out,  i wait for the next day in the morning and i have the truck seen by my son and come to find out that the truck has been wrecked on both the front and the rear,  some parts were heated and straightened not replaced that made it unsafe to be driven,  I asked to have it fixed and they said no. they were rude to me and my son when he tried to speak with them about the truck being bad, they said it was my truck and the only thing they could do was get me another truck i did to want that was more expensive or they could send the truck to get it fixed with my warranty that i was paying and fix the back light that was broken.  i got luck and did not get the trek.  i had to have someone pick up my trade and they did not get the keys or key pad.. I received an envelope in  the mail the following week with my keys and my key pad all broken and bent.  I am still waiting for my check that they cashed that was part of the down payment and the loan was not funded. it should have been returned.  Please be careful when dealing with Steve Essex salesman and the general manager Jamie Juarez.",1.0
15,"September 06, 2014",Love the service center at Gateway Buick&Gmc.Every time i take my vehicle their for any type of service they always ready to get me taken care of as soon as I pull in . and it has been like that since I bought my vehicle from there and the service hasn't changed since. Great Guys,5.0
16,"July 31, 2014","We discovered Gateway and met Steve Essex on June 11, 2011, the day we selected and purchased our 2011 Enclave for wife Gwen.  We were struck immediately by Steve's friendliness and competence and his ability to establish great rapport with our family.  Steve showed us the car Gwen had picked on the internet, and then we decided on a different Enclave.  The key to Steve's success in my opinion was being a facilitator, and letting the product sell itself.  That was the beginning of a great relationship among us, Steve, and the Gateway family.  I take our Enclave whom we have named Pearl for her diamond tricoat color, exclusively to Gateway for service.  I enjoy visiting with Steve and other staff members on my visits.  Our next purchase was a 2012 Lacrosse ""demo"" (Little Red) which required a couple of cosmetic touches...Once again, Steve was my go to guy, and he made the make ready and available loaner car a smooth experience.  Most recently, my daughter was on the receiving end of a T-bone accident in our 2009 Silverado, which she credits with saving her from serious bodily injury...USAA totaled poor PUK ...so, what else?  We called Steve on the hunt to replace poor puck which gave its life to save Jennifer.  Last night our family ventured to see Steve at the dealership on what was scheduled to be his day off...Jennifer drove away in a gorgeous 2014 crew cab GMC Sierra loaded to the gills!  We salute Steve Essex as a salesman extraordinaire, and the entire Gateway family for taking care of our family.  We have been a GM family for may years, and have settled on Gateway as our source of transportation for the present and future.  ",5.0

21,"August 28, 2013"," While we are pleased with the car, there has been an unresolved issue since the test drive. Whatever you do, get the 30 day ""certified"" warranty in writing.   Here is what has happened :

July 27 -  after test drive, deal made (paid full asking price) & noticed rims were discolored ( both men said it would be taken care of) since Gateway has the 30 day   unconditional warranty ; this was a major factor in our decision to buy.
July 28th - took delivery of the car; the detail guy said the rims needed to be buffed out since the clearcoat is damaged
July 30th to August 14th - we made multiple emails and phone calls to resolve this issue
Aug. 16th -  had an appt to see Larry in the Serv. Dept - I took a day off work, spent over 2 hours waiting for Jaime(another manager)  to look at our car.  I was told he was unavailable and no one else could make a decision;  Mr. Cloer authorized the rims to be polished but Larry said it would not correct the issue, and suggested possible refinishing with approval from Jaime.  I explained we were going out of town and thus would go over the 1000 mile limit - Larry gave me nothing on paper, but said the computer would verify the date and mileage.
**** this week my phone calls to Larry have gone unreturned;  today I left a message with Jaime - no response.
As of Aug 28th, Mr. Cloer refuses to do anything since it is cosmetic appearance, not mechanical.  The warranty says NOTHING about whether or not it is mechanical.  They simply tell you what you want to hear to make a deal. Evan is a nice guy, though.
They will not commit to honor the ""unconditional"" warranty or the word of their employees !  I felt that we have been given the run-around since the test drive.  This Lexus is the nicest car we have ever owned & since buying it used, we really wanted it to be right. Gateway made sure it was NOT right !!  ",2.6

I worked on a deal for 3 days and was lied to numerous times! They will tell you what you want to hear to get you in the door and pencil whip you in a heartbeat! Be careful and READ and DOUBLE CHECK all figures! I promise they are turning major profit on you if you don't know what your doing! All a bunch of snakes!!! Lucky for me, I know a little about financing and how to figure the taxes. They tried every which way to tack on some extra dollars and caught them everytime! There are too many dealers out there that actually will do you a service and want your business! They work for you!Disgusting!",2.0
25,"July 13, 2012","I purchased a pre-owned certified LaCrosse from this dealership via internet and phone, after locating the car on an auto search engine. My purchasing process was an easy and smooth transaction, and what made it most enjoyable and convenient is that Randy Morgan, the salesperson, was EXTREMELY attentive and considerate to my needs, questions and concerns.  The dealership is about 40 miles out and Randy took the time to personally drive the car of interest out to my place of work, so that I could test drive and fully inspect the car. Randy was also very attentive with communication in my every phone call and text, even on his day off (now that IS Customer Service). After trying to wheel and deal on my part with the internet price, as well as attempting to have an option added, which was also listed on the ""car description"" and to no avail(the manager Stewart was NOT willing to compromise anything at all)I decided the pre-owned certified, warranted car with low miles was still a good deal and purchased it.  Marcia in the financial department was effecient with my financial questions and in returning my calls - at times she seemed to have a bit of an attitude and rushed through number crunching, I did my best to overlook this and luckily, I located a better APR offer with an outside bank institute, so I no longer had to deal or communicate with Marcia. After my over the phone purchase and all paper work signed, Randy once again took the time to wash, gas up, and drive out and deliver my new car to me - I not once had to drive out to or step foot into the dealership while in the process of purchasing my new car. After delivery, I found a couple of minor flaws on the car that needed tweeking, in which I may have overlooked during inspection prior to the sale, so I called Randy, actually drove to the dealership myself and Randy was there to greet me immediately and had a loan car ready for my convenience. Randy had everything that needed minor attention taken care of in a professional and efficent manner and delivered my car back to me the following day (washed and filled up). My ""excellent"" ratings are all based on Randy Morgan and his personal and professional service, and not so much on the dealership or it's Managers themselves, as I believe the manager's could have taken the time and initiative to work out a better deal with the car pricing and/or the listed added option with me (that's their job to make the customer happy) and customer ""word of mouth"" is what brings in their business, but Randy made up for what they lacked.  The Service Department/Body shop did a great job on the minor flaws and touch-ups. Ask for Randy Morgan, for his fantastic and personal customer service without the hassle or pressure!! ",4.3
26,"July 06, 2012","No complaints with the Service department at this dealer.  Was provided a ride home after dropping the vehicle off.  Service indicated that they keep low inventories of certain parts, so they would require the vehicle all week- they provided a loaner vehicle and offered to pick me up.",3.2
27,"June 27, 2012",Went in to dealship looking for a truck. Saw the one on the lot that I really liked. took it for a test drive and come to find out no power locks nor windows. i stated to the sales person that I was not interested in the vehicle because I was looking for that. He said we have other trucks on the lot so we looked.We went in to the office after he spoke with the sales manager they stated they could install them.i was surprised I asked how is this going to look he state it will look manufatured come to find out it was not and I had stated to him I was not looking for a rig up job.... I am sure that it would look fine to most but to me it was a rigged up job with the buttons on the door panel and not the arm rest of the door.... I called to CNL the sale I was unsatisfied and was given the run around. Then told by Marcia in financing that she was not going to CNL the sale. I had to contact my Credit Union. I left messages early in the morning of June 27. Spoke with sales manager and never got calls back till about 11ish about how they will not CNL the deal. That was told to me at 11:30 and when we hung up she stated that she would call me back I have never heard from here since. It is know 1:24. i hav eyet to hear from anybody on this deal. the only reason I know what was being done to the truck was because I took it upon myself to get in formed by the person doing the job. I hav enever had such a bad experience as this. Marcia informed my credit union that my husband said it was a go on the sale and my husband never spoke to her. I am so unhappy and would never do or send business there. My Credit Union called to ask me if it was a go because the dealership had informed her it was. I stated to her it is not that is not what I was looking for at all. ,2.2

49,"July 09, 2011","Robert (my salesman) was friendly, attentive, showed me several options and with each truck he showed me and explained the options and most importantly to me the rebates and discounts with each vehicle.  No hassels, didn't have to ask, no run arounds, no time wasted with going back and forth to managers, etc.  For me it was far and away the best dealer experience I've ever had, bar none.  I had visited 2 other Chevrolet dealerships and an unnamed competitor in the previous 24 hours, and ended up with a more optioned and nicer truck in the price range I needed to be in.  I definitly recommend visiting Gateway, and make sure you ask for Robert Pope.",5.0

51,"July 01, 2011","My interaction with Julian Gutierrez this past visit was very pleasant.  He seems to be extremely concerned with helping Gateway's customers, making them feel comfortable with whatever service problems they may have, making sure I understood completely what would be done to accomplish the job I needed.  It's very obvious to me that Gateway wants their customers to be totally satified with the services they provide.  I have had a previous interaction with Julian and Service Manager, Alan Cavin and both were very helpful and wanted to assure that I was being provided outstanding service.  I am very glad that I bought my Buick LaCrosse from this dealer. ",5.0
52,"June 30, 2011",I had recently bought my new terrain and had taken it in for my new car detail. While in the lobby I left my wife's CDs next to my chair. They were stolen and they were able to recover them... They were great. Would type more but on the iPhone and don't really feel like doing this anymore! Thanks!,5.0
53,"May 19, 2011","I went to Freedom GMC off of 67 first, HORRIBLE idea! They thought just because I was young they could talk down or offer subpar customer service so I left. Went to Gateway GMC the next day and Steven showed me the GMC Acadia I was impressed it was fully loaded but I'd had my eyes on the Yukon Denali...The Yukon that was is in my price range didn't offer half of what the Acadia did, so I decided the Acadia was the best vehicle for myself and my family. Steven and the other employees at Gateway were beyond great! They were attentive and tried their hardest to get me in the vehicle I was comfortable with. They worked with me and thank goodness for that, I used to hate driving but I LOVE driving my Acadia! This dealership offers A+ Customer Service and has a GREAT variety of vehicles. ",5.0
54,"April 20, 2011","I had the pleasure of working with two salesmen, who were both very helpful, and patient with me, even though at times I was not. I was looking for a truck with certain features and accessories; and they went out of their way to find the perfect truck; the truck of my dreams! If you are looking for a place to buy a new Truck, go see one of them, and you too can experience a no pressure place to buy a car.",5.0
55,"March 10, 2011","I looked online at the GMC Terrains I liked and asked for a salesman to contact me so I could get more information. The next morning Steve called me and let me know about the SUV and specials they had going on. He let me know how much my payments would be a month with the down payment I would be giving. (I was approved with their online app.) Steve put all the Terrains with the options I wanted in the front of the dealership so when I got there all I had to do was choose the color I wanted! We went inside he took all the paperwork he told me to bring and I signed the papers! It was quick and easy. The inside of my New car had a glich in the door pannel so I brought it in and they had it fixed within a few hours! Steve was also very helpful and helped me set up my onstar and answered any questions I had. He also called me the day after I purchesed my Terrain and asked if I needed anything. Steve has also called since to make sure I was still happy with my new SUV. The staff was great and if you are looking to by and New or Used car you should go to Gateway Buick, GMC first!",5.0
56,"January 23, 2011","I am not very good about buying new cars, but I do know when someone is trying to take advantage of me. That was not the case at Gateway, they listened to my terms and never tried to pressure me into anything. Steve Essex made my experience very smooth and stress free and I got a great car to boot!",5.0
