1,"June 16, 2019","My main point of contact is Diane.  She leads a great team of professionals, in every shape and form.  The service department bends over backwards to answer all of your questions with excellent suggestions.  I won't have my old Ranger serviced anywhere else!",5.0
2,"April 26, 2019","Traded in excellent condition 2009 Honda Accord for 2013 Ford Limited. Limited sold at Blue Book price as excellent condition. Upon final discussion with sales person was told limited involved in in MINOR rear end accident. Quote from salesman ""I would never sell you a Lemon"".Day 1 mechanical conditions was told nothing wrong. Continued experienceing problems and told no issues. 3 month in problems resulting in 1,000.00 out of pocket. Warranty purchased did not cover.  Immediately after paying for repair traded for New Toyota Tundra. Ran car fax on limited found out involved in rear end accident with MAJOR frame damage. Additional problems found with over 6,000.00 in engine repairs and 3 cracked wheels. I will NEVER do business there again. Took New Edge in for free oil change and will never return to this Dealer again. Pretty sorry that I'll be paying for this for many years to come.",1.0

4,"May 26, 2018",All I can say is this Ford is the best dealership and Mr. Henry Houston was on point on everything he was saying and someone I would deal with in the future ,5.0
5,"October 30, 2017","I would recommend this dealership to any one of my family or friends which i already have.  Lee made my car buying experience easy, stress free, and as quick as the banks allowed.  He went above and beyond with everything he did for us.  I would send anyone directly to him for a car everyday of the week with the great service i received from him and the other people that worked on the deal.  Thanks Lee and Marshall Ford for my new Chrysler 200, I love it, its perfect for a cool Mimi  which is exactly what i wanted.    ",5.0
6,"September 19, 2017","We shopped at multiple dealerships in Louisiana and left them feeling deflated.  We called the delearership and told them we would be there in an hour, gave them details on what we were looking for and how much we have to spend.  They had the paperwork ready along with the exact car we wanted for the price which turned out lower than expected! friendly service too!  ",5.0
7,"July 19, 2017",My parents informed me of their wonderful experience at Marshall Ford with Stephanie. Months later I shared their experience as I purchased a 2017 Ford Edge! I am so grateful! Stephanie is an awesome person and is phenomenal at what she does!!! Every person that I encountered at Marshall Ford was friendly and the process was quick and it really went smooth! Thanks again Stephanie!!! Your expertise and care is appreciated!!,5.0
8,"July 06, 2017","I recently purchased a 2017 Ford Explorer XLT sport at Marshall Ford. Everyone I spoke to in the dealership was very nice. And then there's Gary..... this guy went above and beyond to find exactly the car I was wanting!  I really feel like any other salesman would've told me that what I was looking for just wasn't out there.  He searched, he brought a car to me at work to look at because I was busy.  It was overall a greal experience!  Highly recommended!!",5.0
