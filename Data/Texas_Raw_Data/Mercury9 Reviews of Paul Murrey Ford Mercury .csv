0,"February 24, 2020",I was very pleased with Paul Murray Ford. They were honest and very helpful through the whole process. They made purchasing a vehicle fun again. Was worth the drive to have some small town hospitality. They will always be the first place I check on any vehicle I purchase in the future. ,5.0
1,"April 05, 2017",Went in for an oil change tire rotation and balance after keeping my truck for 3 days overall (several trips back for problems) I now have 4 scuffed rims and 2 with huge gouges in them and my oil light is now back on. The service manager and Johnny Murray will not do anything to resolve my issues. Not to mention I was treated very poorly by the service manager this has been the worst customer service I've ever experienced! Very disappointed in the local ford dealership ,1.0
2,"November 27, 2016",Paul Murrey Ford earned my business yesterday. I went up there for a specific vehicle and was greeted by Lisa. She got to work and found exactly what I wanted and went above and beyond to get me the best deal. As we were closing my deal my wife and I were talking about possibly trading her car in one day. We'll Lisa worked her magic and put my wife in her dream car and she stayed late after closing time on a Saturday to do it. Mr Murrey shook my hand and thanked us for the business. Great people and an amazing experience! I'm proud to be their customer.,5.0
3,"August 02, 2016","Before traveling miles before you sleep and still not find what you desire, why not cruise over to Paul Murrey Ford in Kaufman, a three generation family owned dealership? I don’t think you will be disappointed with the hospitality or the inventory. Chip, the salesperson with whom I worked, was extremely attentive. I explained to him what I needed and the price range and then we proceeded with the usual process of looking over the inventory. There were many automobiles to peruse. There were no high pressure tactics to buy only what was displayed, you were given options in order to make an informed choice.  	With my questions, I asked a lot, Chip was very professional and knowledgeable, he cleared all my concerns. I was allowed to test drive the automobile I had my eye on for a reasonable time. 
Items I requested to be installed before purchasing were done (within reason) without a hassle.   The experience of purchasing my automobile was stress-free. When I picked-up my automobile from the dealership, I left with a full tank of gas, license plates and a clean, detailed vehicle.
When you have tried the rest, go to the best. I don’t think you will be sorry. Ask for Chip. He will make every effort to accommodate and make your car buying a hassle-free experience.

4,"April 23, 2014","This dealership was a pleasure, from start to finish!  The first phone call was answered by a person, not a recording, and he said ""C'mon in.  We'll be here waitin' on you.  C'mon!""  Chip showed me the car (it had a full tank of gas!) and let me drive it around that pretty town of Kaufman.  Back at the dealership, I was allowed to take my time examining the car.  When Chip and I dealt, he treated me fairly and with respect.  He even asked ""What do you think?"" and then listened to my answer, then made a thoughtful, reasonable, and  logical comment.  He took care of my concerns and the deal was struck.  Chip was gracious and courteous, and exceeded my expectations.  Next time, I'll just call Chip first!  Paul Murrey Ford gets my highest recommendation!  ",5.0
5,"May 18, 2012","Scottie and Britt were the best!  I'm from Oklahoma City, but found the Mustang I was looking for at Paul Murrey Ford in Kaufman, Texas, nearly 300 miles away.  Working a long-distance deal is always difficult, but these guys made it really easy.  They made special arrangements with my financer so that I could go to Kaufman, test drive and approve the car, and drive it home all in one simple trip rather than shuttling back and forth a couple of times to get all the paperwork completed.  The car is fabulous and the service was better.  Don't hesitate to go see these guys!",5.0
6,"March 18, 2012","Paul Murrey Ford has some of the best prices around, they were very friendly, and most importantly provided great customer service to both my wife and I while buying a used vehicle from them last Saturday.  I would highly recommend them any time and will be using them again.  It is very hard to find these qualities out of a dealership now a days.  They truly lived up to ""small town"" southern hospitality and I can honestly say I would not buy another Ford anywhere else.  For those of you who live inside the city and around Dallas, trust me it is worth the short drive!!   ",5.0
7,"March 15, 2012","I recently purchased a Supercrew F-150 at Paul Murrey Ford in Kaufman, TX.  Brit and his team are absolutely amazing people to work with and know.  They will treat you with great dignity, courtesy and respect.  This is my second vehicle to purchase from this dealership and will continue for years to come.  I relocated from my hometown about 5 years ago after buying my Explorer (which I kept) to Austin, TX.  I checked several dealerships around Austin, prior to checking with them.  (Huge mistake on my behalf)  Prices and the right rates were not in my favor.  I go visit my hometown and all in a phone call to Brit, just asking for some prices, he says “Come on in, we’ll find you what you’re looking for.”  Not only did I find the truck I have been wanting, but also Brit gave me an AMAZING deal that I could not pass up.  He personally has exceeded my expectations in the vehicle buying process.  This dealership truly knows the meaning of having heart for its customers and doing business the right way.",4.8
8,"August 25, 2011","I talked to Mr. Murrey on the phone, he claimed to have what I was looking for. When I drove there he  told me he would have to order one and I would have to wait 3 months for me to get one. ( Ford Fiesta )

I drove to Town East Ford and found exactly what I was after.  This dealer has no cats to sell, how can they call themselves a dealer? Don't waste your time.   ",1.0
