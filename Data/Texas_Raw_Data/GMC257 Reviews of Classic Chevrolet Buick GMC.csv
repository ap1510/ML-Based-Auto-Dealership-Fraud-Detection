2,"May 27, 2017","My wife and I and her seeing eye dog traveled to Granbury knowing we may make a purchase that day. We were greeted outside by a salesman. He was not aggressive to the point of running off business as I have seen others do at other lots in the past years. We went inside and we went over what my transportation needs were. Very soon, the vehicle of our needs was found. Low mileage,under 60,000, and only 4 years old. It has the features we need and none I won't use. The pricing was fair and the financing was easily done. My older van was used as trade in. I knew it wasn't worth much but they agreed it to. 
My overall experience was very good at this dealership. I would recommend this dealership to anyone for their transportation needs. I did research on the internet at other dealerships and this was the best price I found. ",5.0

represented over the phone.  Since that purchase didn't work out we came by yours to check out the vehicles I seen on the internet.  Michelle Smallwood assisted us and showed us a selection of vehicles in addition to those I had in mind.  She was a trooper covering the sales lot front to back despite a ailing leg.  Once a selection was made, she made the sales price negotiation a pleasant, professional experience.  Though it was near the end of the day, she expedited the delivery process and suggested 
several restaurants in town for dinner since we'd missed lunch during the drive to Granbury.    ",4.8

quality of work performed,  
years of expererience / training of mechanic performing the repair
price includes more than near by lube shops.  ( routine oil change)
service department provided up to date information on my vehicle when others do not.  (recall info)

example;
my last visit was for a 5k oil change.
i always ask for the ""maintenance 1""  because it includes the oil change plus a tire rotation for only $5 more.       my tires last longer due to the routine rotations.

the service dept rep Cody informed me that my Silverado has a recall issue and that they would be glad to take care of that issue right away.     i had no idea of the recall before he mentioned it.

the previous oil change /  maintenance 1  included a serious tire problem that was not visible during a walk around.    im grateful to the mechanic for discovering this tire defect.  he definetly saved us from a possible accident while traveling down the highway.

thank you Classic Chevrolet of Granbury ",5.0

my recent vehicle repair was totally stress free thanks to Bob doyle at the service department.
bob sent a tow truck to my house, had my Silverado transported to the service center at no charge to me. 
Classic provided me with a loaner vehicle during my repairs at no charge.
the repair to my vehicle was completed that week and free of charge thanks to the 100k  warranty.

what should have been a stressful and very expensive repair  turned out to be stress free thanks to Classic Chevrolet of Granbury.  
thank you to eveyone at the service center for helping me with this repair.

He and Mr. Boswell stayed late to let us look/drive the new vehicle.  They did not beat around the bush, so to speak, with my trade in value nor the price of the new vehicle.  We were able to come to an agreement that evening.  The banks were closed so we needed to part ways that night.  When we arrived the next morning, all of the documents were ready and we were able to drive away in our new (cleaned) vehicle.  Thanks so much for a positive experience.  ",5.0

That is an understatement.  She was and a month later still giving us hands-on expert
help and service.

She took me around, as a woman owner this was awesome, to meet all the service 
department heads, who gave me their personal cell #s, and showed me the newly
decorated waiting areas--down to all the locations for the restrooms.  She worked
individually with me on learning the ins and outs of the radio...phone calling, etc.

Classic has really stepped up to ""sharing the country spirit"".  Great Smiles, Service,
Sales, and Sure enough the Best! From a lady who really did not want a new car..
I now am the very proud owner of my new, beautiful GMC Terrain!!!!
