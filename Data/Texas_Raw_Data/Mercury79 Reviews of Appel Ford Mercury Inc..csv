So I asked my salesman Kevin Tran,  to see if I could just try am purchase without a trade.  Frank. Zach,and Kevin went above and beyond to get me into a new car.  Frank was outstanding,  not only did he get me into a nice vehicle, but the rate,and monthly payments were way in my price range.

Words alone can not express how grateful I am, and everyone treated me with such care,  and respect.  I will definitely share my experience with everyone I come in contact with.

That was important to me!

44,"August 11, 2017",I had my truck in the shop to get the A/C blower repaired. They had to change out the motor I was told. I had a four speed blower before I took it into the shop. It came back as a three speed blower with a four speed switch. I would have expected them to replace same for same. At the very least check it for working condition before returning it to me. I was not told they only had a three speed motor when I picked it up. I noticed it when I switch the switch off and saw it stopped on first speed even there is a stop position. Really sad the technician has no pride in his work. Very disappointed!!!,2.6

Overall it was a very pleasant experience!",5.0
69,"May 24, 2016","I would like to commend the staff at Appel Ford Mercury Inc in Brenham, Texas, for the exemplary service they provided during the purchase of a new Ford Transit Connect Cargo Van.  George Borck provided the information I required to initiate the purchase on-line.  Their website is easy to navigate.  His response to emails was fast, easy to understand, and to the point.  Frank Crawford rendered the mumbo-jumbo financial technical terms into everyday Texan (the way English should be spoken in Texas) that was easy for me to understand and follow.  Blake Sander sealed the deal with an energetic personality that relayed necessary information in a congenial yet professional manner.  I explained to him that I would not tolerate any high pressure sales tactics and he assured me that such tactics are not allowed at their dealership and that he wouldn't use them anyway.  These men went out of their way to make the purchase of this van a very satisfying experience.  Each of them did something I find very rare these days - they all looked me in the eye as they were speaking with me.  To me that meant they were truly interested in making certain I understood the transaction and was satisfied with it.  I am very pleased with the van.  It is comfortable to drive and easy to maintain.  ",5.0
70,"April 18, 2016",I bought a new Ford F-150 and had a great experience working with Appel Ford. Blake Sander did a great job finding the right vehicle for me and answering all my questions. Frank Crawford was a big help getting the deal closed in a timely manner. I'm extremely happy with my new F-150 and would highly recommend working with Blake on your new car purchase. The dealership is very clean and everyone there is professional and very nice to work with. ,5.0

74,"February 18, 2016",Will always purchase and use appel ford for service. The people are awesome! Mary an Richard and Mickey are great to work with.. Quick Lane is awesome as well.,5.0
75,"October 01, 2014","Our experience with the Quick Lane which is next door and owned by the dealership has cost us additional money to have the damage done to our Ford truck repaired after they did repairs.   After purchasing four tires with road hazard warranties and free tire rotation, we  have since had lug nuts broken off and replaced with used ones that were the wrong size and then billed for it.   The worst part has been discovering that when they put the spare back they bent and stripped the spare holder to the point that we couldn't get the spare off.    We took the flat tire to the Quick Lane, in our other vehicle,  and asked if they could replace under our road hazard so we could bring the truck and get the spare tire off and replace the spare holder.  Of course, the tire wasn't in stock.  When we explained the situation we asked if we could get a loaner tire so that we could drive the truck there they refused and told us we needed to wait until the other tire came in.    These people could care less.   They lie and damage your vehicle.  When you complain they want you to make an appointment with the manager at the dealership the next day.  Do not use this place for any repairs.  You will be better off down the road.",1.0
76,"June 16, 2014","It was interesting to read the previous review, which corroborated my experience with Richard (service advisor).  I brought my Ford in for service because the MyFord Touch was not working properly.  Before even asking whether I wanted the service, the service department went ahead and updated my software (which I could have done myself at home by downloading the software update).  Richard was EXTREMELY rude during the whole process.  Never asked permission to go ahead and perform service.  On top of that, the software still has issues with it.  This dealership charged me $150 to update my software.

NEVER AGAIN.  Worst dealership experience I have had.  Richard should be shown the door.",1.4
77,"June 04, 2013","I bought my car from the Hyundai dealership across the street. The Appel service department also works on the Hyundais. I have been here twice for service (once on a Ford and once on my Hyundai) and both times were awful. The front desk guy named Richard in the service department is always VERY rude to me. My visits were about a year apart and both times I left very unhappy. The first time he told me that I could get a ride back to my college campus while my car was getting fixed. I sat in the lobby two hours before I gave up on the ""ride"" and got someone else to pick me up so I wouldn't be late for class. This time I asked him (it was the same guy from last year) for a loaner and the response was ""Check your schedule and bring back the car when you have a few hours to wait"". I went to the Hyundai dealership and thankfully they worked with me and got me a loaner car and talked to a few managers.... I never plan on going to Appel for service ever again. I've never encountered someone so rude and unprofessional. I recommend the Hyundai dealership, but not the Ford service department. Take your business elsewhere.",2.6
78,"November 28, 2011","This is an AMAZING place!!!!!! Tonight, after teaching at Texas A&M, I had a road accident on my way back to Austin resulting in a flat tire. Within 10 minutes after pulling into Riata Ford, I was on my way home. Thanks to Thomas, who, like a Formula 1 pit stop boss, quickly and effortless swapped my spare tire for the punctured one, I was able to finish my trek home. These are very special people at Riata, making the dealership a genuine treasure to Manor and Central Texas. Thanks so much.
