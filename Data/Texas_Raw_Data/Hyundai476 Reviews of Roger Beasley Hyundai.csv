0,"April 30, 2020","We first thought we wanted a Telluride and in fact had ordered one from the local dealer with projected arrival time late summer. Unsure of our decision and the fact the other dealer would not let us test drive the Telluride outside there parking lot we thought we would start looking at others. We arrived at the New Braunfels location one evening in February 2020 just wanting to look at and possibly drive a Palisade. Megan James a salesperson came out to greet us. She was very nice and very informed about the palisade. She showed us the entire car and explained all the features. She then said let's take it for a drive. I took the car down the roughest road I knew (Casteel) and then on the highway, we were sold. Came back to the dealership and spoke to the GM Ricky and he advised they had a palisade in moonlight cloud fully loaded the end of April. Not having that color to look at he said they would hold it for us to look at when it arrived. They were more than fare on our 15 year old trade and we purchased the car once it arrived. Both our salesperson Megan James and the manager Ricky were extremely professional and down to earth. We felt really comfortable with both and you would have thought we knew them forever. Highly recommend Roger Beasley Hyundai and Megan James in New Braunfels. 5 Star salesmanship for sure.",5.0
1,"April 24, 2018","I am military. I would not recommend my soldiers ,friend and family to purchase any cars here based on  personal experience at this dealership. I purchased 2018 sonata on 28th FEB.  I inspected my new car again after i signed contract. I spotted couple rock chips on rear bumper, left side rear door, and scratch on left rear window, so I spoke to sale manager if any paint shop near killeen. He said “yes I will make sure take care it. I wanna you happy. “  i was happy with that cause he promised. Also I got writing statment from him. After couple days later, I got call from sale manager saying he is going to have someone pick up my car and get paint job done in Kyle. I said that’s fine. No big deal. I Waited for two days. My car was back, but I was very disappointed. Whoever did paint job was bad job. They didnot  fix it properly.  I called back to sale manager and tried to expained to him.his attitude changed completely. Perry much saying that all he can do. OMG. I wish I could upload the paint job pics. Text him couple pics. He said nothing wrong with it. Even your porter saw the paint job problem when he dropped off my car.   The sale manager just doesn’t care that’s what I have experienced. I am still waiting for His call for the window scratch. I have been waiting for a month.  Can you believe it. that’s how they treat you. Hopeful someone involve to handle it",1.0

8,"November 30, 2017","Buying a new car at Roger Beasley Hyundai in Kyle was by far the best car buying experience I've ever had! (I'm 56, so many cars in my past.) No high pressure sales talk, and they listened to what I said. I worked with Mike and Brady and they both went above and beyond to be sure I had what I wanted. The new car manager Caleb was equally nice to work with. I live a good hour away (with NO traffic) and they even offered to bring the car to me. I drove away happy, feeling I got a very good car for a fair price.  I would recommend them to anyone- the drive is worth it to work a deal with such nice people.",4.8
9,"November 30, 2017","Big Mike (Austin) was absolutely phenomenal and beyond professional. My niece was up against a deadline and needed a car before November 13 because she was heading to college. I contacted the dealership on November 3 to inquire about a purchase and was routed to Mike. Mike assisted me over the phone, as I live almost 2 hours away, and assured me that help could help me secure a new vehicle within one week's time. At 18, my niece was considered a ""ghost"" and needed a co-signer. I stepped in to co-sign and we were approved! After going back and forth with my family, we finally pulled the trigger on Hyundai on November 10. Mike informed me that he would accommodate my niece and I (she was at work) by delivering the vehicle to my niece's job. I was over the moon! To thicken the plot, my niece and I were heading out of town the same afternoon Not only did Mike allow us to handle everything via phone and emails, he delivered the car on time (had it there by 3:30-3:45 pm), helped us with all the bells and whistles, and made sure the windows were nicely tinted. When my niece finally saw her new car, she almost did a cartwheel! Mike made her so happy and I could have bear hugged him because her happiness was my happiness. The only reason we did not officially test the vehicle with Mike in the car was because we had a 2-plus hour drive ahead of us and had to be to our destination by 6:30 pm. However, my mom (her grandmother) did drive the vehicle 25 miles to our home and was the family member to drive the car. She called us when she got home and stated that the vehicle ran smoothly, had lots of leg room (my mom had a double knee replacement and needs to be able to stretch), and had too many buttons to touch! She was very impressed and we all know it's hard to impress a great grandmother! I truly want to thank Big Mike and the entire Roger Beasley family. My mom now wants a car and we already know where we're going when that time comes. Big Mike deserves a HUGE holiday bonus, incentive, or care package. I never felt pressured, rushed, and trusted him throughout the entire process. Give Big Mike a BIG raise! Merry Christmas!!!",5.0
10,"November 28, 2017",A.    Dustin Wolton my salesman was very nice and efficient.  The best part was the fact he wasn’t that typical pushy sales person. Caleb Lester from finance was exceptional as well !!!,4.8
11,"November 24, 2017",Im really happy with my purchase. Mr. Sandy was our sales man. He went beyond exellent costumer service. He showed professionalism and patience though the whole process.

15,"November 09, 2017","As a first time buyer, I came in not knowing what to expect. Brady Spiller, my salesman was nothing but professional from the moment we met. He understood what I was looking for and was straightforward with me as I with him. From negotiations  to delivery of my vehicle, all my expections were blown away. There was no pressure into purchasing unecessary items in finance. Everyone conducted themselves with the utmost professionalism which was much appreciated and noticed.

30,"October 06, 2017",I was shopping a few different dealerships (one of them being 5 miles from my house). I decided to drive an hour to work up a deal due to the commitment and great communication of the Roger Beasley staff.

32,"September 29, 2017","Before we purchased the Tuscon, I drove an Elantra.  I have been impressed with the 'lack' of servicing that my Elantra required.  I considered it a very reliable.  Too early to tell about the Tuscon, but I think overall that Hyundais are good reliable cars.",4.8

43,"September 20, 2017",We love Mike Wheat! He walked us through the process. Besides finance Mike Wheat was the only person we dealt with. This is the third new car that we have bought from Roger Beasley and Mike Wheat has been our salesman each time.,5.0
44,"September 16, 2017","I had a great experience purchasing the vehicle. The only hiccup was that I wanted clear coat. I was told that it was already on the vehicle.  But then they told me I could get the 'protective package'. They told me this was the clear coat I wanted. I said usually this has to be put on and cured. They told me it only took 2 hours. I later found out what I purchased was NOT clear coat.  I was not happy about that.  However, once the vehicle was delivered, things went downhill. When I tested the cruise control on my test drive l, it didn't work. The salesman told me to turn off the SUV and that it would work. It did.  I was amazed that they had not tested it on the ride from the dealership to my house (over 100 miles)!  I drove it back home and didn't drive it for 2 days. When I did drive it again, the cruise control didn't work and hasn't worked since.  I called the salesman told me to just drive it around and break it in.  I am not stupid enough to believe that driving it around would fix the problem---so  I ended up having to leave it at my local Hyundai dealer and I am still waiting for the cruise control switch to come in.  I have been told this is what is malfunctioning but they won't know until they get the part in.  The only thing the Roger Beasley dealership seems concerned with is me signing the contract that it was sold.  They have not helped me get my SUV serviced--that was on my own time and effort.   They keep saying they will make it right, but they haven't done anything to help me.",2.8
45,"September 15, 2017",I was very disappointed in having to keep returning to the dealership to provide additional banking information after purchase had been made.  The first 200 miles I put on my new vehicle were back and forth to the dealership to provide this information.,4.6

47,"September 14, 2017","Kyle Hyundai was great!  My husband and I went in wanting to get numbers for an Ioniq and ended up leaving with a car because Brian S. and the rest of the staff we worked with were so great.  They were extremely professional.  We decided on the Kyle location after going back and forth with the South Austin and Round Rock location and were not super happy with how they handled everything.  My husband and I noticed that almost everyone that was in the store that day purchased a car, during our 3 month car search we hadn't seen that anywhere else.  We would 100% recommend this location.",5.0
48,"September 13, 2017","I've purchased many new cars in my life and usually spend anywhere from 5 to 8 hours at the dealership. I was in & out with my new car in a little over 2 hours. My saleslady, Faith, was honest, forthcoming, & hard working. Everyone there was very professional & friendly. Also, upon checking, the same car I bought was 2k more at a dealer up north.

63,"August 26, 2017","I have bought 3 Hyundai vehicles from Roger Beasley Hyundai, Kyle.  2009 Sonata.  2015 Accent Hatch. 2017 Tuscon (this vehicle).  I knew I wanted the Tuscon that I saw on-line due to it's option.  I went to see my last salesman (Mr Wheat) as I was 100% comfortable with dealing with him as he is very low key and seems sincere in trying to help someone.  The Blue Tuscon I wanted to test drive had just arrived and not inspected by service.      We went out and looked at my Tuscon, and then he then took me and the Tuscon to service where he arranged for the inspection.  I advised that I was 99.9% sure I wanted that Tuscon, but had to bring my wife around 2:00 pm. as I wanted the vehicle in both our names.  He then took my financial information to expedite the purchase if my wife gave the approval.    At 11:45 am, he put me in a Grey Tuscon with the same features as the Blue Tuscon and told me to test drive it until 2:00 pm.  My wife and I called him at 1:45 pm to tell him we were on our way.  We Test drove the Blue Tuscon and confirmed that we wanted it.     We were turned over to finance where the process went very smoothly.

102,"July 06, 2017","Genesis Executive Management, “From my personal experience, all major Auto Companies send very similar Customer Surveys following important Customer transactions. The Surveys, as usually implemented, are a total waste of time and effort for all concerned. 	                 -The Customer has no incentive or reward for their efforts to provide quality feedback and, in fact, the well-intentioned responding Customer is usually punished with resultant marketing materials he doesn’t want or need.  	                  -No complex transactions or processes are ‘perfect’ and therefore almost always can be improved, but any score of ‘less than perfect’ for those processes is typically interpreted by the Surveyor as a ‘Fail’ and negative actions follow. 	      I think this typical type of resulting action is not professional, doesn’t respect Customer confidences and doesn’t facilitate ‘Coaching’ and the continuous process improvement necessary for all competitive organizations. 	                 -The learned behavior for the Customer is then to not provide quality, thoughtful feedback when that is critically necessary for all competitive organizations. A properly administered quality feedback process can be a powerful improvement tool.  regards, Darvis Cormier",5.0

Buying my daughter a car for her 16 birthday from Hyundai was a great experience because of the sales person Brandon who was not to pushy and in a hurry to make a sale. I called Brandon in the evening with some detailed information on the type of car I wanted for my daughter and instead of calling back a couple of days later Brandon called me back the next day with some great news. Brandon called me immediately to let me know that he found the perfect car. And because I don't live near by I wanted to make certain that it was truly the correct car. So I had several questions and never once did he make me feel that he was just trying to sell a vehicle. Now that is what you call great customer service. Thanks Brandon,5.0

This was the easiest & most satisfactory car purchase I've ever experienced & I am very grateful for everything the staff did to make it so seamless.   My first 2016 Veloster Turbo, which I'd purchased from a different dealership only 6 months earlier, was totalled by my (now ex) boyfriend in a careless one-car accident. I'd been having quite a stressful week, what with my brand new car being destroyed & the person responsible being in the hospital due to injuries sustained in the accident & stressing over whether or not I could get approved for yet another new car loan without the benefit of the $4000 cash trade-in I'd had on the original purchase plus having recently been laid off from my job.   I simply couldn't have asked for anything more from Roger Beasley Hyundai! They truly put my mind at ease & made this such a wonderful experience, starting with Brian (the salesman) offering to pick me up from my house (which is about 30 minutes from the dealership) to the quick & easy financing (with a lower interest rate than my previous loan - YAY!) & paperwork process. I will definitely give Roger Beasley my return business in the future & highly recommend them to friends & family.",5.0

Before we came here we went to Toyota and were very dissatisfied with their service. Roger Beasley gave my trade ABOUT 2 grand more than what Toyota offered.

367,"January 22, 2016","I am a long-time fan of and believer in Hyundai's continued commitment to producing high quality, reliable, beautiful vehicles and their excellent warranty packages.  I have had several Hyundai vehicles and am a satisfied customer--so much so that I recommend the Hyundai brand to my friends and family all the time.  I am confident that I will be a life-long customer of Hyundai's, no doubt.  However, I was not previously familiar with the Roger Beasley organization until this week.  You will read in other people's reviews of their excellent customer service, their pleasant, no-pressure, friendly, and knowledgeable approach with customers about the models in the Hyundai line-up.  It's all true, and I experienced it for the time this week at Roger Beasley Hyundai in Kyle, Texas.  This is a wonderful team.  My consultant is Beth Philbeck who is a friendly, caring, and expert consultant.  I came in with a huge problem, namely that my 2005 Elantra broke down much earlier than what I had anticipated it would and much sooner than I'd planned to get rid of it.  I'm a San Antonio-Austin commuter, so a good, reliable car is an imperative for my job.  At a whopping 211,000 total miles, ready or not, it was suddenly time for another vehicle (all original power-train, by the way, with nothing but 3 or 4 tune-ups and AC recharges from local Hyundai service departments and 2 or 3 new sets of tires over the years, honest, that's it.  Can't beat that Hyundai quality and reliability).  Beth got to work immediately presenting me with some great options in her very careful, attentive, and informative manner.  Not long after I arrived, she invited me to test drive a 2016 model, the very cool, zippy, and irresistible Hyundai Accent sedan.  Taking that car out for a spin was wholly unnecessary.  I loved it the moment Beth got the key and first opened the door to it for me.  And you can look up that car's stats--nothing but a money-saving, economical workhorse that does not skimp on style, quality, comfort, luxury, and killer options, to say nothing about its misleading size.  I call the trunk my spare bedroom—very roomy and useful.  Kyle Larmey quickly put some financing options together for me in a respectful yet no-nonsense, forthright manner.  He is friendly, honest, yet bears the same no-pressure trait as do the entire Roger Beasley team.  They aim for a pleasant, rewarding experience for the customer rather than the strained, assembly-line approach of other dealerships.  I was in possession of a new vehicle by lunch time because Roger Beasley Hyundai makes it easy, very pleasant, informative, and a joy to experience that kind of attention and care.  They respected and understood the position I was in and responded to my needs quickly, efficiently, but always checking with me throughout to make sure I was cool with everything, that I understood the information, and that I was satisfied with the manner with which they answered my questions.  I continue to recommend Hyundai to people all the time.  Now, I will definitely send my friends and family to Roger Beasley Hyundai in Kyle, Texas.  They have the vehicle that will both meet your needs and that will fulfill your desires all in one great package.  You will be welcomed with genuine Texas warmth and treated like royalty.  And their excellent customer service doesn't end when you drive off either.  I had to have a follow up appointment with Beth recently to tie up some loose ends, but it was all pleasure and hardly any business.  She's just as friendly and helpful as the day I walked in with a spent Elantra—with the added benefit that now she makes me feel a part of the Roger Beasley family of very happy and satisfied customers with great enthusiasm!",5.0

Kyle Larmey went out of his way to ensure that we had the very best rate, actually finding a rate lower than our credit union, which is unheard of!  He also walked thru each of the ""additional options"" we could purchase, the pros and cons, to make sure we made an educated decision on each one.

That being said, after getting prequalified and all paperwork filled out before we ever got to the dealership, it took FOREVER to be able to sign our papers and leave. The dealership itself is OK. The building is a metal ""barn"" and it kind of looks like it. I know they tried to jazz it up, but it feels kind of ""walmart""ish. Especially with the Texas Motor Speedway sign out front. It doesn't exactly instill confidence when you are buying a $40,000+ car. The waiting area should be more  comfortable and less like waiting in a tire shop. The finance department was overwhelmed and seemed like they were scrambling to keep up with the amount of customers on the floor. Customers were prioritized on a first in first out type of basis rather than quickly shuffling through easy apps that were preapproved. This made our wait with our new 7 month old baby seem interminable. The sales desks are all lined up against the wall with little or no privacy.

444,"August 08, 2015","If you are in Austin - and interested in a Hyundai - need to go to Roger Beasley - and need to ask for Jim-E-O.

After 4 Honda Accords in a row, we got crazy and bought a Hyundai Sonata Limited.

Few thoughts on the decision and buying experience:
- Honda is a great car - looked seriously at the Accord again - but feel like Honda has become complacent, while Hyundai is hungry... so feel like for a better price, we got a nicer car in the  Hyundai Limited with the Tech package compared to the Accord EX-L..

- Used TrueCar for the starting point. Beasley came back with a very fair price initially, and was able to negotiate a little (without any real pressure) to get a little better deal. Might have been able to get slightly better, but not worth the stress and karma hit to haggle over a couple hundred dollars - feel like it was a fair deal for everyone involved.

- Worked with the internet department and got assigned to Jim-E-O. Very nice guy. Would recommend you ask for him.

- One MAJOR factor to consider with Beasley vrs the other Austin Hyundai dealerships. NO DEALER ADD-ONS. The other dealers add an ""appearance package"" that has things like pin-stripes (which we HATE), fabric guard, etc.. for somewhere between $1500 and $2000. That was an absolute show-stopper for me. End of discussion. I'm not going to even try to negotiate to remove charges for stuff I don't want and is purely dealer profit. That alone makes Beasley the dealer to talk to in Austin.

- Beasley didn't have the exact color/trim level of Sonata I wanted - so they did a dealer trade.  Works for me. When the car arrived, we drove down to Kyle to pick it up... but when we walked in the door. Jim-E-O let us know it actually had a pinstripe  (from the other dealer) WHAT??? Beasley said if we wanted it, they would not charge - but they also knew we hated pinstripes - so offered alternative of removing it and making our acceptance of car based on the fact that the removal of the pin stripe caused no issues - or offered to find another car in our config.. turns out it's really pretty straightforward to remove pinstripes with zero damage - but appreciated that they made sure they were doing the right thing and not rushing the process or pressuring us into something we didn't want.

- Since the pinstripe removal took an extra day, Jim-E-O personally delivered the car to Austin tonight. Saved me a trip to Kyle. Gotta love it!

So bottom line - if you are looking for a good mid-size sedan and Hyundai is on your list - go to Beasley - and ask for Jim-E-O!

459,"August 03, 2014","Went in to look at a Mazda Tribute they had on their website. Was one of the only used cars listed that was not a ""Choice Car For Cash"" (defined as This vehicle needs repairs.
It may have a branded title such as prior salvage title, flood damaged title, rebuilt or reconstructed title, or be identified as a lemon law vehicle under Texas State Law.
The odometer may have been modified before Roger Beasley Mazda-Hyundai-Mitsubishi took possession of this vehicle. The vehicle may have prior damage that is not reflected on vehicle history reports. The customer will pay costs for all repairs to this vehicle.) I should have known when a place even offers these types of vehicles - there's a problem. None the less, this vehicle was not marked as such. 
I was greeted immediately by salesman James Munoz. I told him I was looking for that Mazda, although I would prefer a Hyundai and told him how much I had to spend. I looked the Mazda over while he went back to view other inventory that met my needs. He came back and said ""It might be your lucky day"" - I was thinking, ""oh hey, maybe a Hyundai..."" It was a white Mazda Tribute that had just been brought in that day with about 1,500 less miles. Then he explains it hadn't been tested at all, but had a price over a thousand dollars more than I wanted to spend, and that any Hyundai was about 4 thousand more than I wanted to spend. I should've walked right then and there. 
I test drove the Mazda briefly while he made buddy talk, he guided me down a road that wrapped around the dealership. We got back to a Y in the road and said ""that way is the dealership and that way is the highway"" and I just assumed that meant we had to go back to the dealership and did. Later when problems arose on highway driving and I notified James, he said ""I insisted you drive it on the highway"" I asked in what way he insisted and he never replied. The car seemed fine, I had been in an accident and was pressed for time to buy as my rental would expire, so we arrived at a price & began doing paper work. There was the ""Choice Cars For Cash"" paper to sign. I was like ""uhm this was THE ONLY used car that didn't have that designation"" James states ""oh I am sorry, I guess that was a mistake"" and I was ready to walk the deal. He asked what it would take to still sell it, he came down a hundred bucks, threw away the ""Choice Cars For Cash"" form, and said they'd help if anything went wrong with the car. I took him at his word. On the way home, I noticed it shook some over 60mph & also seemed to hesitate and misfire some at times. 
The very next day I contacted them & they ask I bring it back, and that they need me to stay there, so I missed a whole day of work to bring it to their service team. James, his service tech, and James' boss looked me in the eye and said they didn't find one thing wrong. I insisted there was and James brought out some head guy of the dealership who proceeds to tell me how they only sell nice cars, and that they're always safe - and that if it was something that threatened our safety they wouldn't have sold it. He went on to say ""if it was for example a rotor, they'd want to fix that as it isn't safe."" I drove away with another promise to fix anything that happened. I took it to an independent mechanic who immediately found a warped rotor and brake pads were bad. I told James who had the gall to tell me I should've had it serviced there. I told him that I gave them every opportunity to do just that. After several unreturned messages, I finally had an offer from James to replace HALF the bill since I didn't have them service it. I told him that was unacceptable and that I had been quoted around $200 for repair and they should at least pay that. Days later I finally hear back from him that ""his boss called their boss"" and they would send me a check  within 4 days for $200. 
The next day the Mazda would not start. Turns out the battery died. I notified James who quickly accused me of leaving something on. The battery they sold in the car had expired in 2011, and I guess they had just charged it enough to get off the lot. More unreturned messages over a two and a half week span, and contact from Sydna Kobersky after sharing some of my horrible story on their facebook account. She requested a copy of the receipt, which no one had ever asked for previously, simply her way of accusing me of lying about the service done I assume as she had no intention of paying the actual bill of $251.73 as all that was provided was a snide reply and a check for $200 which obviously comes nowhere near the repair costs, much less the battery, or the day off work to get a misdiagnosis from their ""mechanics"". I had ""tagged"" James Munoz in the facebook post, and when I went back to review it, he wasn't tagged any more, he blocked me from facebook! I guess I wouldn't want anyone to know what a shady operation I worked for either. So, I would not recommend you taking your business to this place and hope that none of you experience such horrible accusations and clearly manipulative business practices as I have. The acceleration issue has worsened and appears to be bad coils which will also set me back a lot of money. ",1.0

469,"August 16, 2012","These guys are amazing. They're honest, patient, friendly, and have integrity uncommon in this industry. Ricky was in no rush to put us in a car that we didn't want. He showed us all three SUVs made by Hyundai. We drove all three. He took great pains insuring we knew all there was to know about each. He helped us (emphasis on ""us"") make an informed decision. Got as a bargain price, and superb financing. There simply isn't a weak suite at this dealership. My wife has taken our car in for routine servicing and Ricky has loaned her his personal car while ours was in the shop A-freakin'-mazing! Who'd a thought it could be like this.

Roger Beasley Hyundai will be our very first stop when it's time to buy again.",5.0
470,"August 16, 2012","Eiji was great to work with via email before I ever met him.  Once we got in to buy, we were even more glad we had him as a salesman.  Everything went smoothly (had to go back for the inspection sticker that didn't make it on, but that was painless), and I know I got the best deal around because I had drive-out prices from 3 different cities.

471,"July 20, 2012","Roger Beasley Hyundai was a sfe haven for me and Jim Hawthorne was my angel.I was nervous when I went in and worried about my credit rating. His friendly, cheerful, relaxed manner put me at ease. He understood my needs (and my wants) and just went to work and worked it all out. Got me the car I wanted at a great price and a great deal.He was very knowedgeable about everything and expplained it all in an easy to understand manner. Ihave to say the same goes for Stephen although I was with him for a shorter amount of time. I am very grateful and would recommend them to anyone in a heartbeat.
