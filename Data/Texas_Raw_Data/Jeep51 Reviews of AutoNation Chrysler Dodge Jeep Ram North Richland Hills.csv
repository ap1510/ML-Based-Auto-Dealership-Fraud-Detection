1,"May 13, 2020","Was called by 3 sales people at the same time, one call was even while I was talking to one of them after sending an internet interest.
Was not told initial vehicle was not available to be purchased until after arriving at the dealership.  Sales process took 5-7 hours, which I had to go through twice as we selected a subsequent vehicle.  Sales people are very unresponsive after you have begun a deal.  Sales and Finance team are very unprofessional using vulgar language and dropping ""F"" bombs around children without care.  After finally closing a deal on a truck we were told that it would have the tank filled and be detailed in about 10-15 minutes, although we were told it would be done 2 hours prior while waiting for the paperwork to be put together.  Took us over an hour of waiting, multiple requests of when it would be ready, and finally just saying, can we just have the truck, it was brought to us, cleaned, however the tank was completely empty.
Overall I am unimpressed with the teams ability to assist customers once they have walked in the door.",1.8

3,"April 30, 2020","I had agreed to a Deal with Marcus from AutoNation on a new Ram truck on April 13, he told me he could deliver it the next day. After taking a day off from work the next day to accept delivery they called and told me they couldn’t deliver that day, but 4 days later. Four days later passed and they called saying something was wrong with the truck and they couldn’t get the truck fixed until a full week later when they got the part in... something they didn’t bother to figure out during the 4 days I was waiting to receive the truck and another vacation day got wasted. A full week passed and the part never came in, that’s when Marcus suggested looking for a different truck, after finding a different truck from AutoNation, I requested a quote and never heard back from them on a new quote. Needless to say I moved on to buying a truck from Moritz who provided an excellent truck-buying experience. If you’re looking for a Ram, don’t bother with AutoNation, Marcus along with sales managers Vijay and Julie provided poor communication and a terrible car buying experience.",1.8

5,"November 19, 2019","When I purchased my vehicle I apparently purchased an extended warranty that I didn’t realize was in the deal. Fast forward a year and I traded that vehicle in and the new dealership told me to make sure I request the credit for the product. I called multiple times (starting in December 2018) and left message and finally spoke to Jason S. Who emailed me the document to sign and I did that very same day along with the required document showing mileage at trade in. That was in January 2019, I have called and left him countless messages and also emailed with not one single response. I’ve been calling and emailing virtually monthly and NOBODY is returning my calls. Some very shady business practices. Perhaps a complaint with the BBB will stir up a response?! I highly recommend staying away from this place!",1.0
6,"October 09, 2019",Terrible service department.  Had vehicle return 6 times to fix ABS problem. $987.00 and 4 weeks later it's still not fixed. You will regret taking your car here for anything more involved than an oil change.,1.6

8,"September 24, 2019",This dealer is the worst. I bought a brand new Dodge Charger 392 Scatpack and they added 10 complimentary oil changes.  Well after checking with service the details of my warranty I discovered that it was for conventional oil. Well obviously being a performance car it takes a full synthetic 0-40.  So I point it out to em and after they talked with service Bob my finance guy was supposed to get it handled. He assured me it'll be fixed with no issues to just give him a few days to call the warranty hotline.  Well a few days go by I don't hear anything so I text my sales guy and he tells me Bob's no longer working there and he isn't sure of the status.  So I show up after work explain to someone the situation and they give me the number to the warranty hotline say I can make the changes myself.  I call on monday and fbe warranty hotline said it's no problem this sometimes happens it just needs to be authorized on by autonation.  He went on to tell me I'm not sure why they didn't just call us and handle it why they had me calling....So I go up there Monday night  and one finance guy was arguing with me saying it's not their problem and if I want synthetic I'll have to pay the difference out of pocket. I'm like look I'm not paying extra for ya'lls mistake that was supposed to be handled weeks ago.  He tells me I'll have to talk to jason the finance manager. So here we are Tuesday 9/23/19  I take an early lunch at work to go talk and get this thing sorted out once and for all.  I get there my salesman comes out tells them the same thing that Bob was supposed to get this handled before he left.  So they all group up I'm thinking they are taking care of the situation.  Well my salesman comes out and grabs an owners manual from a showroom hellcat.  He shows then where it says synthetic but they approach me and tell me well it says synthetic recommended not required so you can either cancel it or pay the difference out of pocket.  At this point I'm pretty irate this situation has dragged on long enough I tell him look the 6.4 can't even run on regular gasoline it requires 91 octane or higher.  Why would it take conventional oil?  He then flips to the gas section of the owners manual and says to me see the 5.7 can run on 87 or higher.  I'm like okay but I don't freaking have a 5.7 I have the 6.4 which look it says requires 91 octane or higher.  So he then gets a phone call doesn't say anything to me just straight walks off...  I'm like ooookay I'll wait a few but the dude never came back apparently he just left me sitting there while he had a meeting with the Gm. So I'm stuck waiting for 25-35 minutes waiting for this xxxxxxxx to come back. He doesn't finally some other xxxxxxxx shows up and starts trying to help me I explain to him the situation he starts swearing up and down conventional oil will be fine I tell him no it won't be and if ya'll are so dead set on putting conventional oil in the car you can warranty me 10 engine swaps because that's what's gonna happen. Well the dude gets all pissy and tries telling me that itll be fine and he's been doing this for 10-15 years then he actually threatened to have the police called and have me kicked out for wanting them to honor what they agreed to. He starts pulling out his phone and going into roid rage and yells. The GM and Jason aren't gonna do it! I'm done with you I'm almost done with you! I say okay you can be done all you want but im not done with y'all so call the cops if you want or solve my issue and I'll be outta your hair.  I told him I just bought a 40k car why are ya'll being so uptight about oil changes just fix what ya'll agreed to it's not my problem the dude no longer works here and the mistake wasn't mine in the first place. We even went back out to service where they told him the same thing I was saying and his response was well we'll just cancel the policy then! He walks out all pissy and mad the service guy which also has a scatpack was like yeah that car can't run on conventional we won't even put conventional in that car go get em to fix their mistake that's xxxxxxxx.  So I finally get back in and they pull me into an office the xxxxxxxx tells the other guy just cancel his policy just cancel it! ,1.0
9,"August 30, 2019","Just purchased my first new RAM truck.  I did some internet inventory research and narrowed down to 5 trucks at 4 locations.  AutoNation CDJR in NRH was closest to my home so I started there.  Upon arriving at the dealership we were greeted by Jacob who was accommodating and knowledgeable.  We explained the situation and the specific vehicle we were interested in and he quickly navigated the sales process to get the price we could agree to.  A simple non-nonsense approach to buying a truck,  Who knew you could still do that...hahaha  Great place.  Try them out.",5.0
10,"August 26, 2019","First, I’d like to start by saying our salesman, Jose, in used cars was great. My husband and I purchased a used vehicle from Autonation Dodge 8/17/2019. The car was at another dealership and they needed to go get it. Totally understandable as AutoNation has hundreds of cars across many locations in DFW. We are in the used car sales department when the vehicle gets back and my husband goes outside to check it out. MANY very noticeable damages that were never disclosed to us via the sales person (as he did not know because it was at a different location) nor the listing description on the website and the car was FILTHY. We agree to take care of the damages ourselves in order to hurry the process along and get out of there as we had been there for roughly 5+ hours at the time and one of the sales managers tells us he will lower our payment if we agree to handle it on our own, not to mention I loved the vehicle, damage and all. They provide a quick outside clean of the vehicle and a quick “wipe down” of the inside and tell me to bring it back for a FULL detail. 

We finally make it to the finance office about 7:30pm and the gentleman shows us the final paperwork (payment not lowered as mentioned by the previous manager) .. We discuss with him what we were told and he fixes that issue. We then tell him that our sales guy as well as another manager had told us we could do a deferred down payment for 28 days if we leave a check with them which was a HUGE blessing to us. He says “yep we can definitely do that we just run the check through a system that verifies that it is attached to a real account” .. Okay great. He proceeds to “verify” the check and then says “oops, I almost processed it for today. I cancelled it though so it won’t pull out of your account, you’ll just need to bring me a different check if that’s okay because now this one is saying it is a duplicate check” .. Confused I ask if he is SURE it is not going to pull from my account right now and he ensures me it will not and not to worry. We finally, at 9pm, leave the dealership and although it was a lengthy process with a few issues as mentioned, I was thrilled about the purchase and love the car. Two days later, my sunroof stops working and is stuck open and to top it off, on 8/21/2019, 25 days early, I wake up and the check has posted to my account causing it to be overdrawn due to the other purchases I had made over the weekend NOT expecting that money to come out when it was not supposed to. 

I got to the dealership and had been sitting in the sales office waiting for someone to help me resolve this matter since 10:15am. Unfortunately, not everyone has $1000 sitting in their account to spend right at that moment which is why we opted for the deferred payment that they agreed to do. 

About 11am a finance manager as well as another manager came in to speak with me. I explain the situation to them and I am told they have to contact corporate in order to get an answer on reimbursement of the hold check that they were not supposed to deposit until September 14th. I explain to them that I will need to know what’s happening with this situation THAT DAY and in the mean time will go back down to the used car area and get the detail they had promised. When my car was sent back (at 11am), I was told it will only take an hour in which I explain “that’s perfect. I have to get my daughter by 3” .. About 2pm (still waiting on my vehicle) I begin asking around to see if someone can get me an update on where my car is and why it’s taking so long and I’m told several times that it’ll be just a few more minutes. I do understand details take time. However, they DO NOT take 3 and a half hours! After my 3 and a half hour wait, I am then presented my keys and shown to the door where yet another sales “manager” proceeds to open the door and tell me “your car is right down there on the other side of that gray truck” .. Oh. Okay. So now we don’t even bring the customers car back up to them? They have to retrieve it themselves? I get in my car, and what do you know? It’s NOT detailed. What seems to have taken place is that they took my car back to detail, no one got to it then when realizing they hadn’t gotten to it (after SEVERAL reminders from me to check on it because I had to go in order to get my daughter in time) they did a quick wipe down with what seems to be lint covered rag and the car is just as dirty as when I brought it in. 

While waiting on the “detail” I was told that they had spoken with corporate and will be reimbursing me the $1000 and I should have it in my account within 24 hours. Fast forward 24 hours.. no refund. My husband and I return to the dealership Wednesday 8/22/2019 to be told that cross-check and my bank placed a hold on the check but that I would have the refund within 12 hours. Fast forward 12 hours and then another 24.. no refund. Saturday 8/24/2019, a week after purchasing my car, still no refund. My husband returns to the dealership and he is told that on Monday, when accounting gets in, they will cut me a check for the $1000 as well as for any fees we may accrue due to their mistake and they are so sorry for the inconvenience and the finance manager gives my husband $300 out of his own pocket to help the situation. Fast forward to today, Monday 8/25/2019.. no check was cut for us and we are then told that “they can’t cut us a check because they are showing that original check was already returned to us which it was not and we have proven that to every person up there several times by showing them our bank account/statements. 

The run around this place gives not only its customers, but it’s employees as well, is absolutely mind blowing and the lack of accountability and respect is disgusting. Needless to say, we don’t see ourselves being reimbursed for their mistake but I will do my best to make sure anyone I know doesn’t ever do business here. ",1.0
11,"August 14, 2019"," I chose them because they were close to my neighborhood, but wish I had gone somewhere else. My experience with this dealership is that they are wildly incompetent.  It's actually quite amazing how bad they are.  Kind of like all the clueless people in the world decided to join up and work at  a car dealership to invent new ways of screwing things up.  There were moments throughout the process where I was just kind of shaking my head at how little the sales guy knew, but I thought he was just a little inexperienced and felt sorry for him. Next, they lost my paperwork twice, and I had to keep providing them copies of things I already gave them.  They finally started the lease process then said they couldn't finish it that day and would run the paperwork over to me in one or two days.  Over one week later I had to follow up with them and it was obvious they did not even have a record of me giving them my car and driving around in theirs.  I had to then resubmit everything in person at the dealership again. I should have walked away then, but didn't . 
So we finally got everything signed and I thought we were done. Then,  13 days later,  they called and told me they wrote the lease wrong and needed me to come in and change the terms.  I decided instead to just walk away.  They were nice about giving me my down payment and trade back, but of course they lost my car's title in the process.  Now I have to get my car's title again, but at least I'm done with them and will go to a real dealer next time.",1.4
12,"June 08, 2019","We recently decided to purchase a bigger family vehicle and I was dreading going car shopping again because of past bad experiences with other dealerships always trying to sell you a car that you don't like or showing up to the dealership and the car you saw on the internet not being there anymore. I was helped by Jorge V. and I gotta give it up to him for the smooth experience and professionalism. He took his time to help me find the perfect car and he even helped out with questions I had, on his day off. I got to take a vehicle home for the day to get a better feel for it and see how it ran, with no pressure whatsoever. I was helped out by another associate when Jorge was off and I almost didn't buy the vehicle because he was the opposite of what Jorge provided. I usually never write reviews, but I decided to write this one in hopes of any people out there looking for some positive feedback or if they need a great sales rep to go to. This being the 10th car that I've purchased has been the best experience I've ever had, If you're reading this and are looking for a new vehicle, ask for Jorge V at autonation. ",5.0
13,"May 17, 2019","My experience with this dealership was horrible.  The staff tried to get me to place a $3,000 deposit when AutoNation obviously has a free online reservation system.  The 2014 Subaru BRZ I was interested in had a number of visible defects that weren’t disclosed by sales staff over the phone/online in spite of requests to do so.  The vehicle also had numerous undisclosed internal defects we learned about only after a prepurchase inspection.  The inspection revealed two prior accidents.  The diagnostic of the electronics revealed that the air bags might not deploy, and a body control module problem that left one of the heated seats and auto up/down window functions not working.  The hood support rod was missing, and the steering wheel wrap was badly worn.  The sales reps kept claiming these issues were already repaired or would be repaired, but the dealership has failed to live up to promises to show me they have.  Online pictures and conversations we have had with staff indicate that accident damage and steering wheel wear have not been repaired.  There are no online pictures of the engine compartment that might show whether a hood support rod has been installed.  Management has invited us to call via email but failed to return our calls.  They have this listed online as a 2014, but the online pictures have ‘13 on the windshield.  I honestly think they’re not being up front about this vehicle and hoping to get someone in to buy it who just doesn’t know any better.  ",1.0
14,"April 30, 2019",I spent so much time to find the right vehicle (3 trips) and when we finally settled on one they refused to sell it to me because I had my own financing in place. We had agreed on a price and had it in writing and they backed out because they wanted to run my credit again to go through their financing. I refused to let them do that and even though one of the managers said it didn't matter to them how we purchased they didn't sell me the car.,1.0
15,"April 16, 2019","I sat in the lane to be helped for 30 minutes, no one ever came to help, greet, or even to say I'll be with you in a minute. They were helping everyone around me though. All I needed was my license plates put on. I ended up leaving and going next door to the Hyundai dealers service department. They helped immediately. This is the second time I have tried to get help from Autonation Dodge service department and both times they have left me just sitting there so I know now not to go back. ",1.0
16,"April 13, 2019","2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee air conditioner when set to off, and set to vent,  air conditioning turns on, on its own. Vehicle IS NOT SET TO DEFROST. Air flow eventually completely stops inside my vehicle because my evaporator is completely freezing up. No brainer... Dealer says it's too humid outside and kept my car for 4 days for nothing. My vehicle was washed when I dropped it off, and returned to me very, very dirty. No service bulletins were checked, nothing else was even looked at. Vehicle was returned to me without a fix. Going to work the next morning, I had the a/c turned off and vents blew air conditioned air all the way to work again. Guess I have to try another Jeep Dealer!",1.8
17,"April 10, 2019",The service and experience plummeted to the dregs of most used car dealers. If you want a good experience do not go to Autonation dealerships.,1.4
18,"January 16, 2019","I visited on December 13, 2018 and wanted to wait until after the holidays to let the events of my visit sink in and make sure I was not going on an off the cuff rant.  I am sorry to say that it did not live up to my expectations.  There are several reasons for this and I hope you have a few minutes as I would like to tell you why.

#1.  The Costco Auto Program.
  
I was referred to this dealership through the Costco Auto program.  This program according to their website is very straight forward buying experience.  Which I did not get when visiting this dealership.  I submitted the model and package I was looking for on the Costco website, and that info was passed along to your dealership.  Desmon Clinton contacted me trying to help me find what I was looking for.  The car I was looking for was not available so I was ready to order what I wanted from the factory.  According to the Costco Auto Program I was supposed to receive the MSRP sticker and a Costco Auto Program price sheet.  This is taken directly from the Costco Auto website.

They did price out my vehicle for the factory order, but I did not receive the Costco price sheet.  I was told that they could not get the price on the factory order because it did not yet have a VIN associated with it to put into the computer, and therefore could not give me a Costco Auto Program price sheet.  (Talking with Costco customer service after my visit I learned this was incorrect.  There is a few different ways to get the Costco pricing including on those being factory ordered, and that the staff at the dealership should have known this.)

On top of this I was shown in the computer on several other models that are supposedly in the Costco program that the Costco program would only save me $200 off MSRP.  I did not say this at the time, but I worked for Costco for 10 years and can assure you that one thing that Costco and its members look for above all else is quality and a good deal.  For $200 off MSRP is not even worth the time and money Costco puts into this program for its members.  The warehouse manager from the location I worked at has purchased his last 4 vehicles, and numerous other people I have talked to have bought cars through this program.  I can assure you that they would not have wasted their time for only $200 off the sticker price.  When I contacted Costco customer service they were very shocked at this pricing as well.  

Also according to the Costco website only certain authorized salespersons are supposed to deal with customers utilizing the Costco Auto program.  When I submitted my request online I was sent a page with several names of individuals at this dealership authorized to work for this program.  None of them were the ones I talked to or ended up dealing with during my visit.  While Desmon did try and assist me there seemed to be some confusion on the staffs behalf on how the program and pricing worked.  This left me less then impressed especially when I had to keep informing them what I was supposed to be getting as part of the program.

#2.  Pricing and shipping.

Desmon and the staff found a close match to the car I was looking for.  Unfortunately it is located in the State of Utah.  When I inquired about the possibility of getting this vehicle shipped here to DFW I was told it was possible, but the shipping for it would be $1900.  (I had a quote from another dealership that found one in North Carolina, and was told it would be $850 to have it shipped)  On top of that the shipping cost of $1900 is absolutely astronomical and ridiculous.  For $1900 I will fly to Utah and pick it up and drive it back myself.  The MSRP sticker price on this vehicle was $45k.  The staff indicated that if I ordered it that they would take off the shipping cost for me.  Seemingly doing me a favor.  When I informed them that the $45k price tag and options on this car were more then what I was looking for I was asked what I thought would be a fair price on the car.  I indicated $38-40k.  I was told that was way too low and they could not give it to me for that price.  Upon my own research I learned that this car was internet priced by that dealership for $40k.  When I informed the staff of this I was told that they could get the car for me for that price but then I would be charged the shipping cost of $1900.  When I informed Desmon that I’m paying for the shipping either way I got a sheepish “well.. yeah I guess so”  I found this attempt at not informing me about 1. the dealers internet price and no attempt to match it for my business and 2. the attempt to make it seem like you’re doing me a “favor” but actually hiding the shipping cost of the car in the sticker price, to be dishonest and in bad faith.

#3. Overall customer service.

While Desmon did help me price out and attempt to find the car.  He seemed distracted during my visit, checking his cell phone several times while seated with me in the lobby as we were going over the package options I was looking for.  I got the feeling that the staff was more interested in selling what is in the lot than what I really wanted  When I indicated that if we could not find what I wanted that I was going to factory order it and was willing to wait for it to show up, that all interest was lost in trying to help get the car I wanted at a good deal.  There seemed to be a lot of push back on pricing trying to get me to pay a higher price then what other dealerships had both quoted me in person, and showed on their internet pricing.  With the car in Utah as an example, I was told that MSRP was the best they could do until I showed them proof from that dealers website, then suddenly the price was able to be dropped.  To me this reminded me of the old slimy car salesman trying to pull the wool over the supposedly unsuspecting buyer.  

DFW is a large area with plenty of dealerships in it.  Several of which are participants in the Costco Auto Program.  If a dealership truly wants my business they have to fight for it.  In this day and age of the internet being at your fingertips the odds of a customer only visiting one or two dealerships and not have an idea of what options and price they want are slim.  This dealership was stop #4 for me, but the first Costco Auto Program participant.  The others before had about the same pricing, but did not participate in the Costco Auto Program.  The others who were not Costco participants were willing to drop their sticker at least to try and compete for my business.  At these locations and this I asked a lot of questions.  A lot of which I already knew the answer to, but waited for the answers.  Honesty is #1 for me.  If I feel I am being deceived I would rather drive to another city or even pay a bit more if I feel the crew is being fair and upfront with me from the start.

In the end.  I did end up going with another dealership for my purchase.  They are a Costco Auto program participant and not only provided all the advantages of the program, but gave me a price sheet $1000 BELOW invoice (not MSRP) on a factory order for exactly what I was looking for.  That is also before all the other possible manufacturer and dealer rebates are applied.  So I ended up getting it for below $38k. 

Getting a automated email from the GM asking how they did and replying to his ""personal email"" also got no response.  I guess they don't really care.  Not only can I not recommend this place I will do all in my power to inform others of the lack of integrity, honesty and just plain ineptitude and steer them to a place happy to have their business.

19,"January 16, 2019","TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. READ THE PAST REVIEWS!!
Don't let these guys fool you with stories about the old Allen Samuels Dodge and how they had a big mess to clean up when Autonation took over. It is just as bad if not worse.  Repairs take weeks rather than days, staff does not communicate, and in general, these people really do not care about customer retention or satisfaction. Suggest you drive a bit further down the road and find a dealer that wants to please customers.",1.0
20,"January 10, 2019","There is no way to express just how BAD my experience has been since 2016 and thru 2019 with this dealership and the Dodge Promaster City Vans that I purchased for my business... I returned 2 - 2016 Promaster City Vans to this dealership for trade-in because of continuous break downs before and after the warranty was over. The last 10K miles alone cost me $10K in repairs. Each van had 70K miles... I could write a book about just how bad this service department is and how bad these vans are... I would never have sold these vans to ANYONE and been able to sleep. This dealership was happy to take the trades and bump the price $4K each. I'm fine with that BUT READ ON - I purchased the only good Dodge that would work for my business which was 2-Dodge Caravans (to be used as cargo vans)... NOW GET THIS - 7 Weeks later this dealership has not - as of yet - sent the pay-offs to my lender. My lender is calling me to make payments on Vans I no longer own that are now for sale / or sold by Autonation Dodge. Again, I could go on and on (and I will at every opportunity, believe me) But suffice it to say - RUN AS FAST AS YOU CAN FROM THIS DEALERSHIP!!! AND DO NOT BUY THE PROMASTER CITY VANS (BUILT IN TURKEY!!!)

*** NOTE - I HAVE CALLED THE PHONE NUMBER LEFT BY THE GENERAL MANAGER (IN MY GOOGLE REVIEW) WITH WITH NO RESPONSE FOR 6-DAYS NOW... ONE OF THE VANS TRADED IN ON 12/3/18 HAS STILL NOT BEEN PAID OFF AS OF 1/10/19 AT MY LENDER, ALLY FINANCIAL - BUT IS FOR SALE AT THIS DEALERSHIP'S USED CAR LOT",1.4
21,"December 19, 2018","I connected with this dealership (Desmon Clinton, salesperson) via the Costco buying program.  Initially, the process was smooth and we agreed on a price for a new Jeep Grand Cherokee.  I completed the purchase and, at that point, was satisfied.  EVERY point of contact since then has been a complete frustration.  These are the kind of people that give “Car Salesmen” a bad reputation.  Non-responsive at every turn.  Cheating at every turn.  Ex - my car had 3k miles on it and had been in inventory for awhile - all OK by me - but the XM radio 1 yr demo and the U Connect demo were expired.  I had to DEMAND multiple times that these be reinstated.  Finally, the dealership complied, but for three months, not the 1 yr New Car standard.  The $750 or so I “saved” on the purchase price has been more than consumed in soft cost/time.  Next time, I’ll pay a little more to have a more pleasant buying experience.  Initial rating on price would be 5 star - now it’s 1

I’ll be contacting Costco next.  In fairness, the service dept at this dealership seemed fine the one time I was through there.",1.0
22,"December 13, 2018","Not a fast friendly customer service dept.  There is no one there to meet and greet you in the drop off line.  I always have to get out and go find a service advisor.  When you walk in the office,  there is still no greeting and all the employees seem to think they are invisible and don’t acknowledge you.  
That’s just part of my problem with their  service.  I took my car in for a check engine light.  First time was an easy fix, was told to bring back if the light came back on. 
When I returned i was informed I need an appointment, enterprise was out of cars, and they were backed up.  Also having a 2013 and no extended warranty seemed to be a mark against me.

25,"October 31, 2018","Dealer/Service dept combo review This is a terrible dealership and service department.  I got my 2015 Ram 1500 Laramie for a discount with ""damage"" on carfax that they ""couldn't figure out how to get 'damage' report.""  I liked price though.  I had to stay at dealership all day to get it purchased by 9PM...  I was promised running boards.  I was given wrong size running boards.  It was a fiasco and a strain on my life for like 2 weeks...

Several months later my wheels/axle is squeaking and I have a leak in back speaker (1st heavy rains since owning truck).  I take it in to them.  I had to wait around 2 hrs to drop truck and get loaner.  1 MONTH LATER after dozens of calls and texts I get my truck back with leak fixed and squeak still there--took a week or so for me to realize squeak.  AFTER many more texts and calls they ""refuse to do further work due to aftermarket 3"" level lift DAMAGE"" and refer me to lift shop.  Will be reviewing ""McKinney Pronto Mufflers"" shop that did minor lift later this week. I give Autonation Dealership 2 STARS for fiasco and inattentiveness to others time.  I give the Autonation Service department and enthusiastic ZERO STARS.  If you have warranteed work, take it somewhere else--don't buy from them if you want them to back up their vehicle with service.",1.8

They advised they needed our social security numbers and drivers license numbers to write the contract.  We advised several times we were pre-approved and to not pull our credit.  Three weeks later we are getting denial letters from banks all over the place and the credit pulls were done three weeks after we purchased the car.

2.  We test drove the car and it had a low tire.  The salesman Anthony K said he would fix it.  Six hours later we drive off the lot with a tire that lost 7 lbs. of pressure on the way home.  We investigated further and the tire still had a nail in it which they dismissed.

After some digging we found it was in Austin at another dealership. We asked for a refund on July 5 and still today July 13 have not been refunded.

32,"February 20, 2018","On 2/13 I found a new 2016 Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland I was interested in online,  I chatted with the online operator who put me in touch with g. Obika. I told him I had a trade, gave him the vin number.  I then get a call from Derek Butts  stating he was the sales manager and told me that they could not give me the maximum trade value without seeing the vehicle, I told him I would come by at 10 am on 2/14
 I arrived On 2/14 at 10:15 am and asked for Derek. I was told by the receptionist that he was in a sales meeting but she would text him.  She asked if he was expecting me, I said yes.  Evidently he did not remember me, the receptionist then said he just left and introduced me to Irwin.  Irwin had my trade, in which I filled out online on 2/13 confirmed, and said we would drive the Grand Cherokee.  25 minutes later they cannot find the grand Cherokee .  Finally Irwin stated he would locate it and then come and find me. Another 15 minutes he comes over to tell me the vehicle is not presentable, battery is dead and the carpet needs to be replaced and he did not know when it would be available.  
This vehicle was supposed to be a demo with 6000 miles,  new carpeting?  I emailed Derek later in the day, no response, I chatted with Austin and John A. Neither were helpful and John refused to give me the general managers contact info. But took my info to tell him to contact me.  So I found ithe number on here.  I have texted him....NO RESPONSE.

38,"October 06, 2016","Called about bringing in my 2014 Jeep Wrangler for a rattling noise and a leak of some kind. Got told on the phone that I could not get a rental car that I purchased in my warranty until they diagnose the problem to make sure it was covered by my extended warranty. When I bought the car I was told it was a bumper to bumper warranty and their own employee told me on the phone that ""ya the finance guys will tell you that to sell a warranty when it really isn't bumper to bumper"". So I asked about making an appointment to bring in my vehicle in to be diagnosed and he said they don't do appointments that I just have to drop it off and wait, and that they are running a day behind. So I take my vehicle in on a Tuesday night hoping to get in line to be looked at Wednesday and the lady that helps us says ""I don't know who you talked to but we are running 4 days behind"". So I am supposed to go at least 4 days with no car?? Well she got it looked at that next day and lets us know it is a oil leak but they don't know from where or why and the ONLY mechanic they have there that can diagnose that problem won't get to it for 2 days. It's an OIL leak there isn't much of anything that leaks oil that wouldn't be covered by a warranty. But still unable to get a rental car. After a call to the manager the lady says ok we can get a rental car you just have to be there by 6 to pick it up. We were told it had all been arranged and the rental car place knew we were coming. Get to the rental car place and nobody had called them at all. The rental car place had only one car available and it was much smaller than the car I bought and paid for but had to take to the shop. Guess I was lucky they had that one car or I would still be without a car. 

The service department says they will call you and let you know this or that and you never hear from them until you have called over and over. I called the lady on her direct line over and over with no answer or call back. I called directly through the main number and get connected to the service department and she just happened to pick up the phone. That was the only way I got to talk to her.

Upon arrival I had to wait 9 min before anyone even showed up at the express check-in to help me.  But of course I had to wait even longer because there where customers ahead of me waiting for the same person.  The person that helped me went to a computer, typed, and left.  I am just standing there.  After a while he returned and I asked if I didn't need to sign something or what?  He said - the waiting room is there.  Like I said.  the oil change was done promptly.  Then the fun started.  The young lady took my payment.  No thank you for shopping at Allen Samuels.  No nothing.  She put my keys on the counter and started talking to another employee.  I took my keys and went to the drive way.  No truck.  I waited, no truck, I waited, no truck.  I went back inside an ask where my truck was.  She look dazed - like a deer caught in head lights.  ""Your truck is at the side of the building""  How was I suppose to know that?  She does not care one small bit about customers.  She is poorly trained which means that management does not care about customers.  Tell the customer anything - get their  money - and to heck with the customer.  It is so sad to see how far customer service has fallen at this dealership. 
If service is any indication of the standards at Allen Samuel's, I strongly suggest you look else where for your next vehicle purchase.  I am sure that the sales staff will say anything, do anything, just out right lie to you to get your purchase.

42,"August 20, 2015","My problem: I have a 2013 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon and when driving over 40 mph it would climb to 6000 rpm and keep going and not shift. So I dropped it off at Allen Samuels in Fort Worth on Sept. 20th. Like I have been told and just like I was told by Curtis the rep who singed in my Jeep it will take three days before it can even be examined. Three days later I am told that my transmission was burned and shredded and it would take another five days to get the transmission rebuild kit as they don’t keep the parts in stock. After the transmission was rebuilt the problem was still there so they do some software updates but this does not fix the problem. When day ten is reached I visit the dealership and speak to the mechanic, the service manager and Curtis the rep. The mechanic has no idea what the problem is, the service manager tells me it could take a month to fix it and I have no loaner.  The Jeep only has 22,000 miles on it and I am learning that problem vehicles under warranty get a backseat to cash customers at this point. They want to pull out my entire wire harness as they think it is a loose wire to which I say NO.  Not until you replace the PCM, TCM or transmission valve body.  They keep telling me that they tested fine and those can’t be the problem. I now call and engage the Chrysler complaint line. My contact is Maurice and after many lengthy conversations I ask him what POWER does he have? Can he make the dealership replace certain parts BEFORE they start actually taking the Jeep apart?  Maurice tells me he has no power and the dealership can do whatever they want as they are privately owned. This experience is made worse as Maurice begins asking me how to get through to them on the phone. I have to explain that they have 10 minute hold times IF they come to the phone and that Curtis recognizes my cell number and simply picks up the phone and hangs it up but I can get through by calling from different phone numbers. Maurice suggests that maybe I can take it to another dealership to which I explain that I have contacted Grapevine Dealership and spoke to the service manage there and he really did not want to work on a vehicle with an existing problem from another dealership. I now get a loaner at this point and the guessing continues. My Jeep never once had any error codes and without error codes todays mechanics have a very hard time fixing things. Critical thinking and troubleshooting skills are almost nonexistent. More days pass and the transmission get taken out again and I am told that a STAR issue has been opened by the dealership and a Master Technician will arrive onsite to repair my Jeep. Am I being lied to by Curtis, of course? Do I know it? Yes I do but my Jeep is now hostage to Chrysler and this dealership. I push to have them replace the TCM and they tell me they did but to no effect. I am also, told that the Master Technician simply won’t drive out there and he actually goes to two other sites but will only advise by phone. More days pass and then I am informed that a brand new Mechanic who was just hired will now be assigned to my Jeep. Why would a new employee get assigned to a major problem ticket? Because new mechanics are guaranteed to get paid a set amount (for a few weeks) when they are hired to help get them acclimated to the new job and so they don’t lose pay. My Jeep is of no concern and no one really cares if it gets fixed as it’s a warranty fix and not a CASH problem. Now I am informed that the new mechanic says that my exhaust is plugged up completely in one of the catalytic converters. So he replaces one then the other and the problem is still there. I state again maybe they should be looking at the throttle position sensor, transmission switch solenoids and valve body. Curtis replies they checked out and are note the problem but they want to take my engine apart now because they think there is an air blockage in the engine that is keeping the transmission from shifting. I say “NO”. I speak to Maurice again at the complaint line where I tell him very clearly so I can have it on record that I will not allow my engine to be taken apart when we are dealing with a transmission. On Day 28, Curtis calls and tells me they ‘fixed the problem’ by ‘flashing’ the chips and driving it around hard for a long time. What this dealership did not tell me was that the mechanic took my Jeep out for lunch and had a burger and fries in it. Now hold in my hand a 6 page invoice. My Jeep was 28 days in the shop and I was lied to so many times I lost count. But here is what I learned. Allen Samuels is a crooked dealership so avoid them. They kept my jeep for 28 days and did not wash the thing before giving it back and the thing was filthy. This dealership doesn’t use seat protectors or floor mat protectors and I had to place a trash bag on the seat and paper on the floorboard myself.  When I got my Jeep back the floorboard paper was soaked with oil from work boots. There was a work boot print on top of my bumper (was the mechanic just jumping up and down on my bumper for fun?) My favorite comment by Curtis the rep was when he told me they were tired of working on it and I should come get it if I lost faith in them. The complaint line for any dealership has no power at all but it is needed for a lemon law legal case. Make sure you document everything and find a Lemon Law Lawyer who knows what to do. Let the Dealership keep the vehicle for 30 days.  It doesn’t matter if it’s all at once or several trips.  The magic number is 30 days for the same problem. Make sure you tell the dealer that you will give an F on the review and you will write out your entire experience on the top three dealer review sites. Finally, never ever go back to that dealer again and always follow through on your promises like I did here. I did get a recall fixed after asking for the 3rd time because they always tell me they don’t have the parts and I did get a free oil change and tire rotation but truth is truth.",1.0
