8,"February 09, 2020",I am very impressed with Mid County Dodge. No pressure tactics used. Neil took time with us and on our fourth visit to the dealer we decided to buy. Neil did a great job explaining the vehicle features to us after the sale and stayed in touch. Even after we decided to buy when the Manager found out I am retired military he gave us $500 more off the vehicle even though we did not ask. Thanks for a better buying experience. Sean,5.0

26,"October 02, 2018","I'm working out of state, but was searching for a specific Ram 3500.  Found the vehicle on the MCCDJR website which is also clearly designed and easy to navigate.  I made the call, asked to speak directly with a sales manager since I had an urgent need to purchase.
After only 5 or 10 minutes, the GM and Sales Rep conducted a conference call to confirm the truck met all needs.  We found the truck was only lacking the cold weather package so they added at no cost.  The GM gave me his bottom dollar drive out price,  I agreed, and the dealer began the prep and vehicle delivery process prior to receiving my finance approval based solely on my word.  This ""down to Earth"" and trusting attitude reminded me of the past generations where  a hand shake on an agreement was better than a contract.  I consider this transaction to be the most efficient, easy, and comfortable out of all my previous vehicle buying experiences.  I highly recommend this dealership and will use them again for any future purchases.   This is how customer service across all industries should be modeled.  Thanks again for  the team effort and quick responses to my urgent needs.  Sincerely,  James Tittle.  US Army Retired and happy Ram Owner.     ",5.0
27,"October 02, 2018","Mid County Dodge did a great job servicing my Ram 1500 recently. Set it up to have a couple of recalls taken care of and during the  scheduling call they informed me that it would take about 3 hours, so at least I knew going into it that I would be sitting that long (I don’t mind the wait if I have an idea ahead of time as to the length of the wait). When I arrived I opted to have an oil change and tire rotation as well as long as it wasn’t going to add a tremendous amount of time to accomplish. I was assured that it wouldn’t. As it turns out, my air filter was almost black because it was so dirty; I appreciate that they found that issue. With all I had done, my total time in and out was just a bit shy of three hours . . very happy about that. Everyone I encountered was extremely courteous and helpful. I WILL be going back for service in the future based on this first experience. Kudos to the Mid County Dodge service Department.",5.0
28,"September 29, 2018","Dropped off my truck for repairs and advised them of my Mopar ectended warranty. They called back with estimate which was quite. They told me I did not have any warrant besides power train. Drove back to desler and showed service mgr my contract, ha said they would take care of it. They called back with another estimate 5 days later saying my warranty covered none of the repairs except exhaust. Drove back to the dealer for the 3rd time. Mgr was at lunch. Went up front and spoke to the guy who sells the warranties. He found the service mgr and finally got my problem resolved. Hats off to that guy, he cares about the customer. Mechanics did a great job. Took 8 days due to the Mgr and warranty person in service incompetence. Truck was fixed properly and returned clean and repaired as I requested. Only took 2 days to repair once they got the go ahead. ",3.4

103,"June 11, 2017","I wrote a review just after we purchased our car from this dealership. We had all rights to take them to court over what took place when we bought our car. I assume our review was taken down due to the fact that it entailed so much truth to the crookedness behind this dealership. None of them were honest with us. Long story short, two employees lost their jobs over our situation. Yes, it was that serious. I have recently been contacted through e-mail by them asking me to come trade in our vehicle. No thank you! October 27th will be two years since we bought our car from these people and let me just say, I STILL have a bad taste in my mouth over the whole experience.

This is very dangerous if I am going down the road and this happens.  I brought it in for it to be checked.

178,"January 05, 2016","Oct. 27th 2015 They had the car running when we got there because ""they wanted it comfortable for us."" We drove it. We loved the way it drove. We killed the car not thinking anything at all about them having it going for us. From there we haggled back and forth with money. You know, the whole dealership negotiation we ALL dread. Mind you, no one has gone to pull the car around to start getting it ready. They knew we were buying it. When we finally settled on a number, they took us to the Big guy (Logan). The guy who pinches the buck just a little more to get all they can. When we finalized everything with Logan (in a totally different building) as we are walking out the door, they are pulling it out of the shop, once again running. I cannot stress enough how devious they were on making sure we never saw anything they done with this car. We left with our car! We were told, ""mechanic has checked everything out y'all are all set."" On November the 8th 2015 exactly eleven days after buying this ""great car"" it won't start. The battery was completely dead. Everything hit me right there, here we are paying 187 dollars for a new battery because no one EVER metioned the car had been jumped off. That my friends is why they ""had it comfortable for us."" I called the dealership and asks to speak with Jeremy, I plainly up front said, "" I now know why the car was running and I want to know who all knew this vehicle was jumped off to get it started, and why we were not told about?"" He stated and I quote, ""well yes, I knew it was jumped off, but we jump vehicles off here all the time."" I was beyond flabbergasted. After several minutes on the phone he transferred me, yes you guessed it, back to the big guy (Logan). Logan assured me that ,that is not at all how they handle business there and they are more than willing to give me a extended warranty at there cost. Only about another 4,000.00 dollars or maybe just a little shy of it. ""Are you kidding me?"" I asked. ""You want me to pay you for something y'all knew about and withheld from both my husband and I in order to finalize a sale? Forward into the future. That battery I bought,  two weeks after buying it, it was dead. They knew very well that this vehicle had a problem. They were needing the sale, it was getting close to that 90 day of owning it, they filled me in on that, you know, because it was such a great deal. They stuck us with a problem. I'm currently writing this review now because today 1-5-2015 my vehicle is sitting in a shop and Mid County Chrysler will not return any of my calls today. We are looking at a money pit because there a several dishonest people that work here. Just some extra information for you.

207,"July 31, 2015","Absolutely ridiculous  after sales customer service.Took the vehicle for first decent drive to Houston after having it for three days and 3 faulty sensor alerts.Dealership answer...""not our problem!!""Before I purchased the vehicle work needed doing on the bumper and the roof..Promises of getting work done to a good standard in form of an I owe you from the company aren't real.Days of waiting after day after day promise of getting an appointment ....Eventually I go to the dealership for the 4th time being ""that guy that always complains"" to get an appointment but rubbish work.The response to that is ""well we would have to change the whole bumper otherwise.One problem of  sorting the roof wasn't even done despite having the car for 3 days.You can get a similar warranty for a third less the price with no deductible from the credit union.Do not buy a car from here unless you have the option of driving it a for a day or two.Taking a man on his word used to have some meaning.Not at this dealership.dont make the mistake I made and get fobbed off day after day!!!Avoiding is better",1.7

219,"February 25, 2015"," This was my 3rd or 4th dealership in the last two weeks.
I drove two different trucks, ended up buying the second one. Did I get a good deal?, I hope so, at least they were cheaper than all the other
dealerships and my new truck is really super. My sales person was Rickey George, and I recommend him to all looking for a new RAM.
The dealership was clean, the restrooms were clean and they always had a pot of coffee ready. Normally I have to demand the keys back
to my truck once they get through with the appraisal, but not this time, they gave me thew keys back and made me an offer.
The only bad experience I had was signing the final papers, thats when I learned that not all components were covered under the 
warranty unless there were a defect. I think this should be made known before hand, just saying.

222,"February 25, 2015","We have purchased several vehicles from Mid County CDJR. Everyone their has your best interest at heart...they truly care and try to do the best they can for you. We have used a couple sales people there, Jeremy May and Betty Chardin. They are the greatest. I was a salesperson for 18 years at a Chevy dealer and a lot of things have changed since then, however they still do business the old fashion way...a verbal commentment and a handshake. The Owner and Sales Manager, Alan Tate, is one of the honest and straightforward guy I know in the car business.  Port Arthur and the local communities should be thankful to have him...
