2,"December 19, 2017","Jewel is always friendly and helpful when I need my Cadillac serviced. This particular time I had an issue with my touch screen, needed a state inspection and my oil changed. She made sure that everything was taken care of and the service department worked efficiently to get my car back to me within 24 hours. I would recommend Moore service department to all of my friends and family. They are always friendly in person or over the phone.",5.0

4,"November 08, 2017","I bought this Cadillac from another dealership ( used ) , but I was having problems with the radio controls , so the dealership that I bought it from , told me to take it to Moore Chevrolet , in Silsbee , TX. , because they are the OEM for this vehicle. I made an appointment with them , so that I could get the vehicle evaluated. I only dealt with the ladies in the Service Department , but they were great. They met me at my car when I drove in , and guided me through what was going to happen and how long it would take , then lead me to the waiting area. Brittney Solomon was my contact person and she was great. She came to the waiting area , several times , along with the other ladies in that department , to instruct myself and other customers , on how the progress was going with our vehicles. These ladies were very busy , running around helping people , but each one kept a good / friendly attitude , and seemed to be very concerned about each person , and making sure they were informed and if they needed anything to make their wait better. Brittney , also told me that my car was still under the factory warrant , so that I could get a free oil change and carwash if I would like. I elected to wait until they actually did the repairs on my car , but I did have the oil change and the car washed after the repairs were complete. This was a great experience and my car's radio controls , seems to be working properly now. ",5.0

9,"January 19, 2017","I went in for oil change, tire rotation and brake check. I was in and out in less than an hour which I was totally thrilled about because I went in after work and was tired and ready to go home. The service was great. The personnel have always been very friendly and courteous there and this day was no different. I have bought my last three vehicles from there and will continue to buy from them in the future.",5.0
10,"January 19, 2017",Awesome dealership! Bought my 2016 GMC 2500HD pickup earlier in 2016 with the 6.0L gas engine. Daniel was my salesperson and he was great! The whole buying experience was easy and enjoyable which is saying a lot compared to other dealers I have dealt with in the past. I have moved to Houston since and used a dealership in the area and was very dissatisfied so I drive the extra miles now just because of the friendly and reliable service.,5.0
