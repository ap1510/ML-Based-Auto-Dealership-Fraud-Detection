2,"June 20, 2020","Daniel has treated us like family. I am on my 2nd new 2020 G Wagon and my son has bought 2 AMG’s including a G 63 along with Sprinter Vans. We would not go to anyone but Daniel. He has a customer for life. Ask for Daniel when you go in. His level of respect, attitude and knowledge is like no other and much appreciated.",5.0
3,"June 20, 2020",Excellent place to do business. Daniel was very helpful and patient with us. He's not at all pushy and gave us all the necessary information and helped us make our decision easier.

6,"June 14, 2020",Daniel has been great and professional throughout the car buying process. He is very knowledgeable and helped us select the right features for our custom build and kept us updated on the build and delivery dates. We loved the car when it finally came out. Thanks to Daniel and the team for helping with the contact less closing of the deal and delivery of the car.,5.0
7,"June 14, 2020",Daniel & Ermin were beyond knowledgeable & honest!  This was my third vehicle I purchased from Mercedes McKinney & this transaction was super smooth!  I highly recommend them!,5.0
8,"June 12, 2020","Let,s be honest, buying a car is not a fun experience.  At least for me.  I absolutely hate it. I spent several days and weekends trying to find a good, reliable, and affordable car for my oldest son.   I was not very confident I was going to be able to accomplish this task without enlisting the help of my husband.  And then, I met Daniel Ali.  Daniel was honest and knowledgable when answering my questions, and put me first over other customers.  Daniel made our experience pleasant, seamless, and quick.  No games or slick talk.   If you need to purchase a car, call Daniel!  We are so pleased and definitely recommend working with him.  Daniel, I look forward to buying my next car from you!",5.0
9,"June 12, 2020","Sadly, I didn’t buy my Mercedes from MB of McKinney, but I sure wish I did!!! 

I went in with my fiancé to purchase her MB and immediately I felt the vibes and warm waves from the extremely friendly crew. I made my way to and through every vehicle on the showroom floor. I knew after a short discussion with Daniel Ali that my fiancé would take care of her on this purchase. We enjoyed the time at the dealer so much that we are making it a mission to refer friends and family to your dealership. And on to my friend Tarah Land who I enjoyed talking to so much that I had to... I mean had to buy something. I purchased a service warranty plan for my Mercedes. Thanks Daniel!! Thanks Tarah!! We now have matching Mercedes and we own you all a great deal of appreciation! Thank you!!",5.0
10,"June 12, 2020","Daniel Ali is so amazing and awesome. I don’t have words to express how great my experience was. Everyone there was so helpful, friendly and professional. The financing manager Tarahland made me feel very comfortable and went over all the details.",5.0
11,"February 08, 2020","First I want to say I have purchased 15+ cars in my life and this has to be my best experience.

I was in and out in less than 30 minutes !  I worked with Gerald and Stewart and they both were great!!  
Their communication before and after the sale has been awesome!!  I live in Houston but purchased my used car here and I couldn't be happier.  

The service and experience was First Class.

I will definitely look here for future car purchases",5.0
12,"February 05, 2020","Gerald Cardenas is a lazy, rude jerk...  No sense that he is there to serve the customer.  My wife and I went in to get some basic questions answered about vehicle warranty. The Finance adviser didn't know the answer, he went to get his boss.  He stormed in and boomed out ""I hear you have a question!""  Rather than admitting he didn't know the answer and saying he didn't know, he told me that I should just google it myself, and in a snotty manor, as if I were a moron or something.  I pushed back and said his non answer was unacceptable. He pushed it off on Mercedes Corporate and tried to make me believe it wasn't in his purview to answer warranty questions. I told him I spent a bucket load of money on a vehicle and he better find out for me.  He never did.  Pushed it off to an underling. 

I noticed reviews were stellar until 2017 for this dealer, I would suppose it's when this brat started. 

I would only recommend this dealer for the people we worked with that were great. Daniel Ali, Stellar dude! David Oden, Great! Jamie Khan, Wonderful! Steven in Parts Fantastic!  Gerald Cardenas, not so much...

The G,M, brought the rating down for all of Mercedes, it created a very bad taste for me that Mercedes will have to work to recover from.  The Stink starts from the top.  My Rating is for all categories is strictly for the employees that I dealt with.  The Overall dealer rating is low because of one bad person.",2.6
13,"February 04, 2020","This is one on the best car dealerships I have ever worked with, and Daniel Ali is the best salesman I have met in decades. He was quick to respond, professional and kind and no pressure at all. Our experience could not have not been better.",5.0
14,"February 03, 2020","One of the worst car dealers, not just for MB! My entire buying experience was bad. Then i had problems with number plates. Then with fuel leakage. The Car Internet i had paid for did not work and
had to call MB multiple times to cancel. Today i learn i have to go to the DMV in person now to change the ownership simply because MB has not changed the title of the car i traded in... Heights of lethargy!!!",1.0
15,"December 18, 2019",Daniel Ali sold me by 3rd AMG. I have dealt with at least 4 different MB dealerships in three different states and he is by far the salesman I've had the pleasure of interacting with. Highly recommended!,5.0

17,"November 10, 2019","Lied about diagnosis, another dealer (plano) proved they were lazy so not cover warranty. recommended repair work that was unnecessary, would not respond for discussion. filed complaint with MB North America with customer advocacy",1.8
18,"October 14, 2019","We made an appointment to see car, drove 2 hours to get there and they were selling it to another person. They made us sit for 1 hour while other buyer was approved. They then tried the switch and bait. We talked to manager, all he had to say was sorry. Don’t buy here, CROOKS",1.0
19,"October 05, 2019",Mike Hermus sold 4 Mercedes to me in last 3 years and I would never have anybody but him. He sold me 3 glc300 and a glc250 about a month ago and I’m very happy with all vehicles 1st class guy 5 stars,5.0
20,"September 15, 2019",Super rude general manager. Customers are not respected. This dealership only focus on making from from you but nothing else. i had pretty bad experience with them even tho I have bought 3 cars with them. I trade in my cars with them and they are still holding my trade in credit about 160k. I ordered a car and they just sold my car to others because they take over sticker price from another guys. Don’t buy anything from this dealership. You still have other better choices.,1.4
21,"August 04, 2019","DO NOT waste your time trying to buy a car from MB McKinney. The sales staff is SO rude and unprofessional, and they are quite incompetent too. I’m pretty sure a toddler could sell a car better than them. We bought elsewhere solely because of the fact that Joy, Mike and the rest of the team treated us less than dirt. We had a way more enjoyable experience buying at MB Plano.",1.0
22,"June 24, 2019",Service on my new car had to go back several times. Left messages with the service manager and general manager.  Neither return calls.  Car still periodically does not down shift a low speeds.  Very dangerous when this happens.,1.0
23,"May 31, 2018","I bought a rather expensive bit of scrap metal from these people last December, in the form of a 2010 BMW 535i.  I should have known I made a mistake when the onboard computer warned me of the first mechanical problem just as I was about to drive it off the lot.  
The mechanic who supposedly knows BMW's was absent that day, but I was assured the problem was unlikely to be serious, and anyway the BMW guy was going  to be back the next day, and he'd call me.  He didn't, and as I was visiting family from out of state, I had to leave Texas the following day.  A fact which the salesman was aware of.  No accusations, just saying.  
And yes, I know, buying a car far from home was probably a mistake, but for crying out loud, this wasn't Big Al's Used Car-Orama, you would think you could count on quality from a dealership where they've got $80k and $90k cars all over the floor.  Another lesson learned.
Well, I have now had this lemon for almost exactly five months, and so far I've had to have it towed to a mechanic to have the oil filter housing and the serpentine belt replaced, and now I'm going to have to have it towed again because the transmission has gone out.
From of all of the positive reviews on this site, I have to conclude that these people are doing something right, at least with new Mercedes's.  But they really ought to get out of the used car business, and people looking to buy used vehicles from them need to be very careful.",1.0
24,"April 05, 2018","We had an excellent experience here!  Larry, Sam and the rest of the team were so welcoming and patiently answered all our questions.  Sam was a great salesperson to work with as he was honest and sincere, directing us to the car that best fit our needs. Hard to find that kind of integrity these days.  We never felt pressured and were not subjected to cheap sales tactics.  Larry and Sam are an asset to MB McKinney. Highly recommend this place!",5.0
25,"February 02, 2018","I contacted MB of McKinney on a Tuesday and gave them pics, V.I.N., and a complete description of my trade-in (2016 AMG GTS). I followed with 3 emails asking for some info about the 2016 S63 that I was interested in. 3 days later I still haven't heard 1 single word from them..............

When I finally used the AutoTrader ""Chat"" feature, MB of McKinney customer service rep explained that they have been very busy and will get back with me when time allows, then ended the ""Chat""!",1.0
26,"August 01, 2017","I bought a 2008 Lexus GX470 that I was assured was in great condition and in fact I was told that their mechanic wanted to buy the car but after he and his wife looked at it closer they did not buy it.  I was never told the reason.  Shortly after buying it I had to put almost $1800 in the vehicle for suspension problems.  I am now told that the car needs another $1200-$1800 in work for CV joints and CV axles.  The carfax showed a wreck that they assured me was minor and said the car was impeccably maintained.  Did not expect this kind of treatment from an MB dealership.  I should have checked the reputation of the Sonic group of dealerships.  They are much more interested turning a quick profit than in gaining a long term, repeat customer.  ",1.3
27,"March 21, 2017",I am completely amazed at my experience at Mercedes of McKinney! We pulled up and were immediately greeted by Bradley Roberts who completely made our car buying experience a pleasure. We had no idea what we were looking for but Bradley was very patient showed us everything and explained ALL our options. We went with a CPO and couldn't be happier. They detailed the car explained all the features and Bradley went a step further to help make sure the car was spotless and gave my two girls little teddy bears in the backseat just going a step beyond. At most dealers that's pretty much where the customer service ends when they hand you the keys....NOT with Bradley Roberts. Customer service begins after you drive away with your vehicle. ,4.8
28,"March 16, 2017","Came in for a tire.  Bought a car bc Bradley Roberts made a deal I could not pass up.  Next day he found a better deal on a BETTER car!  Unreal.  No one works this hard to make me happy.  LOVE HIM>  Love dealership.

Who WORKS TO MAKE YOU HAPPY AFTER you buy a car????????????

Unreal.  I am truly floored by the lengths this young man will go to to make his customer happy.

Service Department is also top notch.  And Manager of location is a dream. ",5.0
29,"March 15, 2017","Went in for a new tire.  Left with a new car.  Bradley made a deal I simply could NOT refuse.  When I wanted another feature HE made it happen. 

Friendly, warm and really really hardworking.

Dealership is brand new.  Gorgeous, huge and modern.

Will be using again and again. ",4.8
30,"March 14, 2017","Mr. Bradley Roberts, totally Amazing!
You were truly God sent to me and my husband Calvin Daniel Jr.
 Also, I'll like to mention Mason,  Luis , Manjuel and Mr. Mike. Your kindness will always be remembered. Whatever you do in the future, Please don't get rid of Bradley Roberts. He will get the job DONE!  A Job Well Done

Bradley, brought us such Joy, To God be the Glory!

I highly recommend Mercedes Benz of Mckinney to all my family and friends.
Everyone was super outstanding !!

32,"February 28, 2017","I recently purchased a new E-class from Bradley. I'm a single woman and the car purchasing process is usually something I hate doing. I had been to several other dealerships looking for the right car. I looked at BMW, Audi and Cadillac...even had been in another Mercedes dealership. Everyone of them wanted to ""push"" me into the vehicle they thought was right for me. Bradley was different. He was patient as he showed me several cars and SUV's. He was attentive to my needs and helped me find the perfect car that met both my needs and budget. If you are shopping for a new car, go see Bradley. He cares before, during and after the sale. ",5.0
33,"February 27, 2017",Bradley Roberts was great to work with as was the entire team from sales management (Steve) to finance.  My circumstances were unique in that my wife recently had surgery and was not able to really be out and about.  The dealership bent over backwards to accommodate us and made the purchas transactions one of the easiest I have ever done!,5.0
34,"February 24, 2017",One word EXCELLENT!!! Dougwas wonderfuk with everything. I've looked for this vehicle 6-9 months and finally found the one. Can't forget the FINANCE Department also GREAT!! Everyone was friendly and eager to help. I strongly recommend McKenny Mercedes and don't forget to ask for Doug Burton!!!,5.0
35,"February 15, 2017","Recently purchased my Mercedes from this wonderful dealership. Everything about my experience was excellent but what really stood out was my salesman, Bradley Roberts. Knowledgeable, attentive, and an absolute professional. He went above and beyond with his customer service. I highly recommend Mercedes-Benz of McKinney and will definitely be dealing with Bradley Roberts with my future car purchases.",5.0
36,"February 15, 2017","I worked with Bradley who assisted me to get the car that most fit my needs and desires. Not only did Bradley give quality service and respect my demands through out the entire car buying process, Bradley also assisted me after I purchased car and drove to Missouri from Texas to assist me with some problems I had after the purchase of my new Mercedes. The service that Bradley Roberts provided was beyond his call of duty and this experience with Bradley will be the main reason I will be a returning customer at the dealership. I am giving the highest marks to the dealership because of the customer service experienced by Bradley Roberts from the start of looking for a new vehicle until the completion of purchasing a new Mercedes the type of customer service was white glove by Bradley Roberts he is the best I have ever experienced and as an extremely busy professional with a demanding career of my own, Bradley Roberts made the car buying experience an easy process and I feel Bradley was an advocate for me the customer in working out the deal to best meet my needs. ",5.0
37,"February 11, 2017","My wife and I just purchased two Mercedes vehicles from Mercedes McKinney. We worked with Bradley Roberts and I must say he will work tirelessly to ensure that you have a great purchase experience. I would definitely recommend working with Bradley! He has become more than just our car salesman, he is a friend also.
We also had a great experience working with Larry Reeg, Mike Child and Heidi Clement.
We enjoyed working with all of them and look forward to doing business with them again.",5.0
38,"February 03, 2017","I recently purchase a car from this dealer ship and the experience was more than amazing. I found the car on the website and chatted with Jonathon to set up an appointment. He was very thorough and very informative regarding the car, he took me on a test drive and I knew this was the car for me. While taking my husband on his test drive we decided this was the car. When we returned to the dealership I explained to Jonathon this was the car and we went to the finance department (Amanda) and finalized the purchase which was a smooth process. I left that day with a new SLK 250. I am extremely excited about the purchase of the car. If you need a car ask for Jonathon he will make this process very comfortable for you. ",5.0
39,"February 02, 2017","Being a single woman going to a car dealership can be overwhelming,  Thank GOD I gave Mercedes Benz of McKinney  my business.  It all started with a phone call that got connected to Bradley Roberts.  Bradley had such a warm presence over the phone and didn’t pressure me.  I was very adamant that I didn’t want to come into the dealership  unless the numbers were right via phone and  I didn’t want to haggle over price.  Bradley assured me that he could make it happen.  When I arrived Bradley had the car I choose down to the detail with everything I asked for, he hit the mark.  The thing that impressed me the most is the he was a man of his word, what he quoted me over the phone is the exact deal I got.   He made this experience enjoyable and stress free.   Bradley is truly  ""The Man""  first class professional, high integrity and NOT high-pressure.   The excellent services didn’t stop there, I met with Larry Reeg the sales manger and he treated me like family.  Larry took the time to patiently educate me on the technology perks in my new vehicle, but he also had the scrupulous eye to review my car as though it were his own. I was shocked that he patiently went over the details and safety features of the car even though the dealership had closed hours ago.    Honestly I felt like he treated me like a daughter. This dealership will forever have my business. 

I  could write 10 paragraphs on my experience with Bradley and Larry, but the bottom line is this: They exceeded my expectations (expedient delivery; no haggle price negotiations excellent customer service and attention to detail and most importantly integrity);

Thank you so much!!!

40,"February 01, 2017","I went in to look at a new Mercedes simply because we now have a dealership in McKinney. Now I have the prettiest E-300.  I had no intention of buying a new car when I walked in but found the entire experience, just refreshing. Jon Brown did everything he could to make this the best car buying experience I have ever had. 

I dread going inside any dealership because without fail I either get treated like I don't know what I want or that I am incapable of buying a new car without my husbands approval. Jon went out of his way to find out what I wanted and help me find the perfect car. He worked with me to get a good deal and didn't play any of the GAMES you experience everywhere else.

I just can't recommend Jon Brown at Mercedes of McKinney any more highly. If I could give him 6 stars I would.",5.0
41,"February 01, 2017","I sent a message on the internet to inquire about a new Mercedes. I got tons of people calling me, emailing me, anyways, it was exhausting. Out of the bunch, Bradley stood out because he was helpful, yet not pushy. I made an appointment with him to get the information i wanted about the vehicle. Let's just put it this way, he went above and beyond to get me a deal I was comfortable with and get me the car I wanted with the features I wanted. I absolutely love my car! Bradley not only helped me out with the purchase, but continued to stay in touch even after to ensure that I was happy with my car and that everything was going well with it. I will definitely go to him when it is time to replace another car. It was a wonderful experience from start to finish. Bradley is honest, patient, caring, and very accommodating, which is something rare when it comes to salesman. He is simply the best! I have to say the same about the other staff, Amanda Abshire, Heidi Clement, and Larry Reeg. They're absolutely awesome. What a great team there at M-Benz of McKinney!!!",5.0
42,"January 28, 2017","I have worked with Bradley you can not find someone who work as hard as he will to help you get the RIGHT Car for YOU. He just know's. Smart Guy , wow....... What I saw was how he was able to get the managers to agree with me on what I wanted. Thank you again. May we stay as Friends.",5.0
43,"January 15, 2017","Thanks to my salesman, Bradley Roberts, I had a fantastic experience with a rather complicated out-of-state transaction.  I purchased a used car that had to be delivered to NC.  Mr. Roberts was attentive, responsive, and knowledgable throughout my car-buying experience.  He makes it obvious that he cares about taking care of the customer and answering and addressing all questions and issues immediately to keep them at ease.  If you're buying a car at this dealership, ask for Bradley.",5.0
44,"January 11, 2017","This was the first vehicle (and first Mercedes-Benz) I've purchased at Mercedes-Benz of McKinney. As such a new dealership, you go in expecting a few ""growing pains"" and disorganization, however that was not the case in the slightest. The staff here is extremely professional and take the time to fully explain everything to your satisfaction. Everything inside the dealership was immaculate and well attended to and everyone you interact with is a real class act.

The sales manager, Larry Reeg, dedicated his undivided attention to me explaining (in detail) the financial aspects of the lease he presented. When I asked specific questions, both Larry and the sales consultant Bradley answered them completely and ensured that everything was fully disclosed. I really appreciate the tailored approach to this transaction and will put Mercedes-Benz of McKinney at the top of my list when I am in the market again for a new vehicle. I have since recommended several others to the dealership and await hearing back on their experiences. Also, Amanda Abshire in finance and Heidi Clement in concierge were very amicable and attentive and made the process even smoother.

My sales consultant, Bradley Roberts, has actually sold me another car previously at a different dealership. One of the main reasons I went to Mercedes-Benz of McKinney was to see Bradley again as I truly believe he has my best interests in mind. This was evident based on the deal he put together for me the first time around as well as the ""post-sale"" attention he provided. In this sense, I consider him a trusted advisor and would love to continue working with him for future vehicle needs. That said, if you are in the market for a Mercedes-Benz, I would wholeheartedly recommend you to Bradley. I take this endorsement very seriously and fully anticipate that you will leave fully satisfied by visiting this dealership and a true professional, Bradley Roberts.",5.0
45,"January 02, 2017","I had researched online and was fairly certain of the car I wanted. I stopped by Mercedes Benz of McKinney after going to the gym to just ""look"" at cars. Bradley came out to see if I had any questions or needed any help. I told him I was just ""looking"" but he still very graciously helped me, showing me every car they had of the model I was interested in. Bradley helped me find the perfect car for me, so we bought it that same afternoon! In summary, Bradley was excellent, the best salesman we have ever dealt with!! I recommend this dealership & especially Bradley Roberts! Ask for him by name!",5.0
46,"January 02, 2017","With research in hand, I walked through the door at Mercedes-Benz of McKinney and met Bradley Roberts right away. I showed him the car that I was interested in, and we immediately went for a test drive. Bradley was helpful, direct, and honest throughout our conversations and went the ""extra mile"" to ensure all was done in the way we agreed to. From finance to walking through the vehicle with Heidi Clement, everyone was helpful and respectful. 

Car buying experiences can be challenging, but the experience with Bradley Roberts and the team at Mercedes-Benz of McKinney was different in a very good way. Thank you.",5.0
47,"December 22, 2016","I originally went to MB of Plano and they wanted me to work with them on their terms.  I stopped in MB of McKinney, and met Bradley Roberts.  He was professional, listened to what we were looking for and immediately went to work to find the perfect car... in the manner we wanted to shop.   He looked at his lot, he checked locally, and then went into the Sonic Automotive network and found our car in Nashville.   Within 2 days, we had a great deal on the car we wanted.  

Bradley kept us informed every step of the way as he looked for our car.  He was a true professional and a pleasure to work with.  We will definitely work with Bradley when we are looking for our next vehicle.   Thanks Bradley! ",5.0
48,"December 21, 2016","If you want class service expected when buying a highly valued car make sure and stop by and visit one of the best Sales people in the business, Bradley Roberts.  Bradley is a no nonsense salesman and never pushed anything...being in sales I appreciate this more than you know.  We were treated as if we are family throughout every step of the buying process.  Larry Reeg, Sales Manager, was and has been a long time friend throughout or purchase history with him going back 10 years.  He provides a welcome experience and is a consummate professional.  Lastly, Heidi Clement, Product Concierge, exemplified professionalism during our ""get to know your car tour.""

At 5 pm I called him , he then told me that No one has looked at my car yet. He then told me he would call me in the morning. The following morning came and gone so I called him at 4 pm , his response was that No one looked at my car yet . I needed my car advised him that to pull my car out front and I would take it somewhere, then he hung up on me. To me that was totally uncalled for. This was the first and last time I will visit this dealership . I took it to another dealership they gave me a loaner car and in 3 hours had all the work done and car washed and clean.
