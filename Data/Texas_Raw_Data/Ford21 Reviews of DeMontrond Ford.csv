1,"July 24, 2019","This has been my Ford service dealer of choice for over twenty years. I drive fourty minutes to get to this dealer. They have made mistakes, but has corrected them without a problem. As many dealers it seemed that they started trying to sell more services. On this trip they didn't try so I was happy that they didn't. They only asked if I wanted the tires rotated. I will have them do it next time. As a senior citizen I don't want to do it myself any longer. I also bought parts and they called me as promised so I could drive back to pick them up the next day. So yes I drove 90 minutes two days this week to spend my money at this dealer.",4.4

5,"June 05, 2019","I was greeted right away when I pulled into the service area.  I was just there for an oil change and tire rotation, they notified me about a recall on my vehicle and took care of that as well.  The wait time was not long, and they offer free drinks, coffee, popcorn, and ice cream while you wait.  Very friendly staff.",4.6

16,"March 11, 2019",The only complaint I have is the service department.  My truck was in for 10 days because it took so long to get the parts.  No loaner was offered.  Now the same problem has occurred.   Afraid to take it in because I cant be without a vehicle for 10 days.,2.2
17,"July 20, 2015",I ABSOLUTELY love my 2015 Ford Fusion. I enjoyed all the smiling faces and all the service I received while I was there I would recommend my friends and family to this establishment anytime.,5.0
18,"July 14, 2015",I have bad credit and had been turned down for a new car at several other dealers.  Anderson Ford is literally around the corner from my house so as one final attempt I went into to see what they could do for me. I was taken away at how helpful they were. Everyother dealer I had gone to treated me like I had some infectious disease once they saw my credit score but that wasn't the case at Anderson Ford. They went through everything with me and when I left I drove off in a used 2013 Hyundai that they had. I couldn't belive it.  I won't be buying a car from anyone else ever again. ,5.0
19,"July 06, 2015",I emailed Anderson Ford looking for a Ford Ranger. The nice lady was quick to respond and set us up an appointment with Scott. Scott showed us the new F-150s. Man they were really great. Scott helped us with every question and saved us money too. This is the second vehicle we bought from Anderson Ford. Thank you,5.0
20,"May 15, 2015",I went to Anderson Ford just to check out a FX2 F-150. The people there were so friendly and helpful. I bought when I was intending to come back. They were so friendly and down to earth,5.0
