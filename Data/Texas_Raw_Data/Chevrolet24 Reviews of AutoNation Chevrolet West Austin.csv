0,"January 08, 2020",I have had the worst experience with this location. My car has been in their service department for 2 weeks and they still have not told me when it will be done. I have contacted my service rep Hal many times in regards to some answers. He says he will call back but never does. I have contacted the managers several times about Hals lack of communication. After I speak to them he does call me but it is usually just to say he will call me back (which again he never does.).  I am a single mom and had let him know this several times and informed him I need a car. He knows that my warranty company only covers the rental for 10 days and has made no attempt to help me get my car within that time. I am afraid I will be with no car and stuck with the cost of a rental I can not afford. He has shown no sympathy for my situation and to be honest has no customer service skills.,1.0
1,"December 20, 2019","The atmosphere is kind of weird in this dealership. I get somebody helping me. Then I found the salesman knows less than me about his car. When I ask for test-drive, he cannot even find the car from the parking lot. We walked around the lot several rounds in the cold wind. Ends up that the car I required, which they said available on their website, has been leased to somebody for several months. That's even not the funniest part! We checked the other color, tried to negotiate. Then the salesman started to be mad at me for I was trying to negotiate. If you do not want to negotiate, just say 'this is our bottomline, I'm sorry'! He gave me something called 'ridiculous offer punishment fee' adding 250$ more to the original offer. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Worst dealership I have ever been to. And please, hire some smarter salesmen who can make deals happen.",1.0

I just bought a Pre-owned Truck.
They did Not fill Gas, I drove out of with a Empty Tank! After emailing them about it  they just ignored me ! The truck was not well detailed and told them to please clean it up and they did way worse job than it was, it seemed like they wanted to laugh at me. Henna Chevrolet has always given me a full tank and detailed perfect and Auto Nation failed! I WILL NEVER BUY AGAIN FROM AUTO NATION AND WILL RECOMMEND THEM!
To me either you DO a good job or you Don’t !

3,"August 26, 2019","Update: After a year of dealing with AutoNation Chevrolet, I'm changing from 4 stars to 1 star. Shane Bogardes was an excellent sales rep and provided a great experience a year ago. After that, nothing but incompetence, slick-talking finance guys, and a culture of understaffing and overworking, leading to egregiously bad customer service and consistent mistakes by their collision center staff. Most recent experience below. 

After my original call 5 weeks ago in response to a recall notice, during which I was told someone from AutoNation Chevy would call me to set up an appointment, I didn't hear anything for a week. So I called and left messages and voicemails to follow up, including with the department manager. In total, it took 3 1/2 weeks for someone in the service department to return my phone call. When I finally got my car in there, it then took 4 days for anyone to return my call to give me an update. That 4th day, it took me calling 3 times to get a response. Should I rent a car? Is there a major problem? I had no idea and was Uber-ing around town.

One guy told me he worked from 7am-7pm every day. When I suggested they hire more people, he said they were fully staffed. It's obvious that this place is understaffed and overworked. The lack of customer service, follow-up, and attention to detail across the department clearly demonstrates poor management, and inability to prioritize customer needs and the overall customer experience. 

Ultimately, someone named Tony took over my issue, communicated with me clearly, got my car serviced immediately, and even gave me a free coolant flush (because the coolant problem stemmed from an error of theirs the last time I had work done -- an error caused by understaffed and overworked employees making mistakes). So I did leave there feeling better, and I do appreciate Tony. But unfortunately, it was too little too late. 

While my car purchasing experience was great at AutoNation Chevy, every single interaction since then has been terrible, from their attempt to rip me off on an extended warrantee, to taking over a month to repair a minor fender bender and returning the car with a new windshield rock chip and active error codes, to charging me for a repair that was likely caused by their collision center's shoddy work, to now taking a month to respond to me to get my car in for a recall fix. How is this place still in business? I'll be going elsewhere from now on, and I'm also now not surprised that the Volt didn't bring new people into the Chevy brand like they were expecting. Those of us who are used to Toyotas, Nissans, and Hondas, have come to expect MUCH better from auto service departments. AutoNation should be embarrassed by this and should hire more people so they can provide at least decent service.",1.6
4,"July 29, 2019","The brakes had issues on my Chevrolet car. So, I called on Friday to ask which tow company to use. I was told the name of the company that AutoNation uses. But what I was not told is that my warranty might not cover the tow bill. The car arrived at AutoNation around 1:00 PM on Friday I still did not have a call by 5:00 PM so I called to see if the car had arrived. Then I inquired about loaner vehicles while my car was in the shop. I was told that all the loaner vehicles were out for at least 2 weeks. On Saturday I called to inquire on the status of my vehicle at that point I was informed that loaner vehicles may be available on Monday and asked to provide my driver’s license and insurance. When I did, I was told that I could not have a loaner vehicle since I use Progressive insurance period obviously this was not communicated with me from the very beginning and I needed to secure a rental car. Instead of giving me the name of the rental car companies that AutoNation works with I was just told to call the rental companies. 
So, on Monday I called my warranty company to inquire about how to get a rental car. I was told that AutoNation would have to call my warranty and provide the issue of what was wrong with the car before I could get a rental car. I relayed this information to AutoNation. There was no resolution until Wednesday evening when they finally had a diagnosis of what the issue was. They called my warranty company and told them the issue, then I was able to get a rental car. So, I was without a vehicle Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday. Obviously, this is a huge inconvenience. I would not have expected a car on Friday since it was dropped off after noon. But I would have expected a car by Monday evening, given that they had half a day on Friday, all day Saturday and then Monday. 
I use Hertz rental car typically so that is who I chose for my rental car this time. Once the car was finished on Friday, I was informed that AutoNation does not have a contract with Hertz so I would have to take the reimbursement up with my warranty company. Now this is what I was planning to do anyway however if I had known that AutoNation would have covered the rental car or reimbursed Maine then I would have used the rental car company the nation has an agreement with. But this was not communicated with me either, so it was not an option. 
Now I was given a bill for $153 the bill was the $100 for the deductible on the warranty which I was aware of. But the other $53 was for the tow bill that was not covered by my warranty. Again, this was not communicated to me from AutoNation now $53 is not really an issue but it's the point that I had had so many issues with AutoNation the lack of communication, the stalling of diagnosing the problem, etc. The customer service person I was working with said they would inquire with the service department if they could cover the remaining portion of the tow bill, but they did not. 
When's my car was finished they tried to upsell me on almost an additional $1000 of services for my vehicle. Now this this this was very annoying given all that I have been through and it really put a bad taste in my mouth. The one thing that I will say positive about my experience with automation was that the customer service person that I was working with, Hal, was very pleasant and communicate with me via text whenever I texted him. I would say that is the only redeeming factor of my experience with the service Department. 
However, this didn't make up for all the other issues that I had now I've been a GM owner for over 20 years I'm a very big fan. But this experience in the service Department has been atrocious. And you can understand my frustration given that it was so many days without a vehicle the inconvenience the lack of communication and then at the end trying to be up sold on more services for my vehicle.

5,"March 18, 2019","Purchasing a 2018 Volt last year at this dealership went well. It was only after I did my taxes last month that I realized I had been deceived.
The sales reps assured me that I would get $7500 back from the federal government’s incentive program for electric vehicles. When I first asked the sales manager (1 month before purchase) if that was a tax deduction or what, he said, “No, that’s a check. That’s a check!” The saleswoman that sold me the car also told me that I would be getting $7500 when I did my taxes.  At no time did anyone at the dealership mention that the amount could be less. I have now done my taxes, and the amount I am getting is around $500 in the form of a tax credit. I had made the decision to purchase the car based on what the dealership told me. They deceived me as far as the rebate amount from the government, and I ended up spending around $7000 more than I had expected to.",3.3
6,"August 22, 2018","I went into the dealership on Saturday 8-4-18 and was looking at a 2014 chevy Silverado with around 55,000 for around $24,000 but did not have a backup camera or remote start and that would be added for an extra fee and would bring the price around $27,000  and Jesse Monko , was the sales person . went to the new car sales building to talk to Cory about the finance part .Then they were supposed to run my credit once but they ran it three times .Which is not right .So with my high interest and the extra warranty and all the extras they added it to around $38,000 .Went and talked to my bank and told me it was a bad deal .So went in on Monday the August 6th to cancel .They had a $15,000 check of mine that was supposed to been cashed on the 10th .They told me that they would not cash it but they lied to me and cashed it anyway .So I had to make 4 trips to the dealership to get my money back and talked to , Jason Easley,  all the time and trouble I had to go thru .That is no way to do business .As this truck was 4 years old and could have bought a brand new one for the price .",1.3
7,"April 14, 2018","In the course of several other repairs, they also changed a light bulb over the license plate.  They charged $50 labor to change the light bulb!  No wonder my entire bill was over $950.  They must have thought that I wouldn't notice.  What a rip-off.  Never again.",1.0
8,"February 19, 2018",I took my 2008 Tahoe in for an oil change and tire rotation and was pleased with the service including time to complete the service.  The service writer advised me while I was there I needed my brakes serviced as they were down to indicators.  I took it in the next Tuesday and they repaired the rear brakes.  I then received the next day a survey request for oil change comments.  I also received an email providing a service coupon for brake service ... after I had already had that service performed.  Would have been nice for the service coupon prior to the brake service work performed.  But overall very pleased with this dealership service.,4.8
9,"October 25, 2017","I was in the market for a new Chevy 2500 HD truck. I was not going to walk into a showroom and go through the sales pitch and haggling to make a deal. I contacted several Dealerships that had the vehicle I was looking for. I simply asked for their best drive out price on the vehicle. No, I am not going to come in and talk to the manager. You know what your best price is give it to me. AutoNation Chevrolet in West Austin did just that. Shane the sales representative gave me a price I was pleased with. I live outside of Houston and made the purchase from a dealership in Austin because they accommodated me in my purchase by filling my request. Shane was excellent through out the purchase agreement, explaining everything and handling the paperwork in a very professional and timely manor. The best new vehicle buying experience I have ever had and I have purchased several new vehicles over my lifetime.",5.0
10,"September 11, 2017","Our experience buying a new car at AutoNation in Austin was first-class from start to finish. Shane, our sales professional was attentive, transparent and thorough and just simply made the car buying experience fabulous. But the culture of the dealership starts from the top down and that can be attributed to one man, Ronnie. He has done an amazing job of creating a culture of trust and family that you feel the minute you walk through the door. This was by far the best car buying experience we have ever had and we'll be back again for our next one soon!",5.0
11,"September 06, 2017",I've been going to this dealership for 5 yrs. now. This is the 1 time that makes me HIGHLY UPSET. I'm looking to trade my truck just to get out of this dealership. That's sad because I do like this p/u.,2.2
12,"July 12, 2017","A simple 90K mile service which I thought would take 90 minutes at most took almost 12 hours. And the cost that was published online (between $200-$300) was inaccurate - the actual cost was over $850. I was originally going to wait for my vehicle, but luckily was able to get a ride to work that day, otherwise I would have missed an entire day of work waiting on my truck to be serviced. ",3.0
13,"May 27, 2017",Service was completed in less than 2 hours after drop off.  Only down side the service shuttle only dropped me off at work and it is now the policy of the dealership that they will not pick you up from work or home to retrieve your car.  Since I only have the 1 car this is an unnecessary complication to continue to do business with Autonation Chevrolet West Austin.  Independent shops do offer the shuttle service to and from their shop.  They never follow online service appointments.  It is best to call them,3.2

15,"May 08, 2017","
We recently purchased a 2017 Sparks that I found listed online through a finance company website.  I arrived at the dealership without any appointment and not even knowing the area.  From the moment I stepped in the door until the moment I left with my keys I was treated just like family. Mark Welch, my sales rep, understood exactly what I wanted and was very attentive and even went well above what I expected to help we get set up on the Onstar and Chevy apps.  I am so very satisfied with my buying experience. They were easy to deal with and went above our expectations.  The best is they listen to me and didn't try to sell me more than I needed but got me the vehicle we wanted.  I'm thrilled and I'm gonna be a repeat customer for my next vehicle purchase.

17,"April 19, 2017","Pleasant interior space, very low-pressure process, the most pleasant and painless car purchase I've ever experienced. George Baldauf is a credit to his profession, AutoNation, and Chevrolet; he went above and beyond again and again, long after the original sale.",5.0
18,"April 11, 2017","Tony Do is without a doubt THE best service rep I've ever experienced. My fourteen year old truck finally had a major breakdown the day before I was taking a long trip to my aunt's funeral. As the necessary part to repair my truck was in Fort Worth, there was not enough time to execute the repair prior to the last possible moment I could leave. Tony set me up with a loaner and sent me on my way, told me not to worry about a thing. And, I'm not talking compact car. The loaner was comparable to what I drive, only BRAND NEW. When I returned two days later my truck was repaired and waiting for me at the EXACT cost I was told it would be. When my daughter graduates from college in a couple of years and I'm ready to purchase a new vehicle, I know I'll be going back to Auto Nation. With customer service like that, why would I go anywhere else?",4.6
19,"March 07, 2017","Beware of bait and switch at this place with the manager Mitch the Switch. The online pricing is a lure to get you in and it is not honored. We walked in ready to buy only to leave with a terrible taste in our mouths. On their website they had an offer for a Chevy Colorado for 28,999. I even had the sales rep give me a quote with TTL via text and email. When we got ready to sign the papers they pulled the switch and quoted a price almost 1,300 more. Mitch the switch manager completely wasted our time, he was rude, and unapologetic for the false and deceptive advertising. After our experience I had a good look at all the single star reviews, several people had the exact same experience.  They falsely and deceptively advertise to get you in. Don't waste your time on this place. I guess since we were a Monday sale, they wanted to see how many other suckers they could get in on the bait and switch before the week is out.  I'm not even going to bother going to another Chevy dealership.",1.0
20,"May 16, 2013","Being a first time car buyer I was nervous about what kind of experience I would have, however if I would have know how great of an experience I was going to have I would have gone months ago! I am impressed by not only the transparence of the individuals I worked with but also their ambition to make sure I got what fit my indidual needs. Carl was beyond wonderful, knowledgeable, and really just a pleasant individual - you can tell he really enjoys what he does. The finicaing department was also amazing, I almost didn't mind giving my money up for the down payment :) Ian in finance made sure I understood everything and worked out an even better payment plan for me then I thought I would get. My parents were so pleased by how these two gentalman made the experience they are planning on purchasing there next vehicles from Carl and AutoNation. My car isn't even a day old and I have started recommend people to go check it out! Thank you AutoNation! Go see Carl Brooks today!! ",5.0
21,"September 19, 2012",This place has horrible customer service. A young family member of mine recently bought a car here and was tricked into buying a bunch of extra overages. When I called the managers to complain the guy said that the bank puts on the coverages. So then I called the bank who said that wasn't true. I talked to my own bank that I have banked with for over twenty years who told me it was all a scam. DO NOT BUY A CAR HERE. By the way did I mention I had to leave messages five times before anyone called back?,1.0
22,"August 29, 2012","I purchased a used Jeep Wrangler from David Byers and simply put, I have never had such an incredible experience from a car purchase as I had on this one. David was honest, friendly, and extremely knowledgeable in all aspects of not only the vehicle I was purchasing but the process to own it. I have been in retail sales for over 10 years and learned so much from my time with David. I had such a good experience, that when I or my wife is back in the market I will come find David and allow him to wait and find the vehicle for me. I am not nor have I ever worked for the dealership. It was simply that good of an experience. I highly recommend DAVID BYERS at Champion the next time you are in the market for a new or used vehicle.",5.0
