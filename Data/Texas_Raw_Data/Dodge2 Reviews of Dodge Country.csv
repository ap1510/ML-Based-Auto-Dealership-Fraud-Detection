0,"October 26, 2012","I called about a car that I saw on an internet site and scheduled a test drive. The woman I made the appointment with said she would call if anything about the car changed between our conversation and the test drive appt. I was told to speak to Patrick when I arrived. When I arrived (15 min early) after a 2.5 hour drive, I was handed off to Carlos. I was told that the car that I had made the appointment to see wasn't on that lot and that we would have to go to another lot to find it. We went to the other lot. Carlos went in to check on their computer inventory and said that the car had been sold that same morning. Carlos asked me if there was any other car that I might be interested in. I wasn't.

At that point, I just wished someone had called. However, when I was in the lobby another customer came in looking for a car that his wife had called about. He was told that it was no longer on the lot. And he was asked if there might be any other car that he was interested in.

1) I wish they had followed through and called me the way they said they would.
2) I now doubt that they had the car when I called. I notice that it is still posted on all the car sites.",2.3
1,"July 28, 2012","Son purchased 1998 Kia Forte to travel back home on 30 day leave from the army and he was taken advantage of by being sold a vehicle with 4 bald tires that would never pass inspection in any state that I know of.
Personally I would only be annoyed being a father but to take advantage of a soldier that protects OUR rights and our Country is a down right shame. 
I am 30 year certified master technician that inspected the car while it was here in Pennsylvania. 
After several attempts to contact the dealership I was flatly told there was nothing they could do!
Hopefully this dealership can make right by him and at the very least provide him with proper and Safe tires. ",2.0
