0,"August 27, 2019","Looking to buy online? Do it. I have never purchased a vehicle without looking the sales manager in the eye and driving the vehicle first, so it was a bit of a hyperventilating first step. That said, John, Jerry, Carmen, and Kayla made it easy -- as did Kelsi, the finance manager. Ever spend hours in the finance officer's office doing paperwork? Won't happen when you buy online. I had been researching vehicles for a while, drove some of them locally, and then purchased this one that matched what I was looking for. The team answered all my questions, gave me a reasonable deal, and delivered it the same day -- over 200 miles away! When they arrived, I drove it, signed the papers, and they returned home. Done deal. Easiest vehicle transaction I have ever experienced --- and I have purchased a lot of them.",5.0
1,"August 26, 2019","I gave one review but this is my final review, I purchased my Escape on Saturday, site un seen. I asked for a Loaded escape. (It wasn’t). I left with a Fusion ( loaded on Saturday while waiting on my Escape to arrive on Monday). It arrived, was washed and ready to pick up on Tuesday night. I drove it home and called back on Wednesday morning, to tell the dealer I was not happy and wanted the Fusion. I was told they would see what could be done. I received no call back on Wednesday. I drove to the dealership on Thursday and was told, it depreciated when I left and nothing could be done, drive it a year and trade it in. As I sat on the lot on the phone to my husband, the salesman came to my door & said that Kelsey would contact the bank on Thursday and see what could be done. I received no phone call Thursday. I called at the end of the day & no one would talk to me. Friday at the end of the day, 5:30, salesman returned my call from the morning & said, I know Kelsi contacted the bank, but will be Monday now before we hear back. I called at 4:30 pm and no one will talk to me again. It is 6: 12 pm and no one has contacted me again. I have had a Regal, Fusion, F150, Ford Lariat, Flex and an Escape before this purchase, I thought customer service was important.apparently not. This will be my last Ford purchase from Stanley in Sweetwater.. Everthing was fine until I signed the paperwork, now it’s like I do not matter. John, did not return my call,  Carman and Kelsi didn’t call back.",1.8

3,"August 20, 2019","The service desk focuses on ‘service’ to the customer. They are knowledgeable and their communication skills are beyond reproach.  I took my Subaru for a scheduled oil change, I asked for The Works as I had received a notice from Subaru for a recall on a latch. As that required a trip to Midland, wait time at dealership & return - I surely did not was additional services there. Troy & Jeff took care and attention. ",5.0
4,"August 19, 2019","Our Acura developed a sensor problem a few miles short of Stanley Ford while traveling from Tucson to Dallas.  Troy tested the battery, did some trouble shooting  and recommended we reset the warnings (there were 7 including transmission, emission, parking break and so on).  All problems disappeared and the car worked for the rest of our trip.  Our cost?  Zero, nada, zilch.  I bet when we take it to the Acura dealer for some investigative follow up our cost will be much higher.  I cannot thank this dealer and their attitude of service enough.  They are champions in our book",5.0
5,"August 16, 2019","I saw this car online  and decided to make a telephone enquiry.  This car was in sweetwater and I was in Lubbock. I was able to do a credit application over the phone, later that day  I received a phone call from  a manager stating that my credit had been approved. The following day the  car was delivered to me in Lubbock . Prior to me taking possession of the car I did a walk around inspection of the exterior , where I noticed a dent on the right rear door. I pointed it out to the man that delivered the car and he asked if I had looked at the pictures online?  I said yes, but it didn't show  any dents. I called the Manager  and he said  that if I bought the car he would have that repaired.  I signed the papers  and made sure that the repair was in the contract. On 8/5/19 I took the  car to Sweetwater as requested by the dealership.  I received my car back on 8/15/19 The door was fixed, but the car now has a lot of road noise and I found a bloody bandage and a green leafy substance in the car. This car was never Detailed or even cleaned on the inside. I would recommend to the dealership to make  a greater effort  in delivering a shiny clean car with  a fresh oil change,  and all the fluids topped off. ",2.4

I just Took my car in Saturday for an all around check and just this morning, my tires are under inflated. Once again, they got my sons truck. I gave Them the parts to do the work. One person told me on Saturday it would be finished today by Bobby because there wasn’t much on the roster. However, when I called At 2:00 to check, it hadn’t been touched at all and Troy knew nothing about it being worked on. It’s ridiculous the lack of communication that ends up affecting the customer. I’ve given them numerous opportunities for business, but I will Not any longer.

114,"January 21, 2019","1st visit...turbo went out on my pickup: I was over a hundred miles from home, and was towed in to Stanley Ford after hours on a Saturday.  Monday morning they called, and we made a game plan.  Order parts, fix everything, wash the truck (it was filthy!), etc.  Went Friday to pick it up (yes, they fit me right in - no wait!).  That black truck was so clean, inside and out, I almost didn't recognize it!  Yay!
60 miles later, still 20 mi from home...I lost all power and black smoke was everywhere.  I called Jeff; he said to have it towed back to them by anyone I wanted to use, and Stanley Ford would foot the bill.  Upon closer inspection by someone much more mechanically inclined than myself, we discovered the clamp had blown loose and one of the lines to the turbo had disconnected.  We asked that Stanley Ford mail us a clamp rather than incurring a large tow bill for them and causing me another trip to Sweetwater to pick up the vehicle again.  They one upped me.  Saturday morning they sent  tech out here (160 mi round trip).  He completely replaced the hose and clamp, and discovered the line and clamp to the windshield washer fluid had been damaged as well.  They will mail that to me this week.

210,"February 07, 2017","Worst Ford Dealership I have ever dealt with in my life. I have bought countless Ford trucks, and I was in the market for a 2017 Raptor. Screwed me out of the truck I put a deposit on. AVOID THIS PLACE. The Finance Guy Robert and Sales Manager Michael have terrible attitudes. Will never do business with this place.",1.0
211,"May 29, 2016","Working with Jerry and Danny at Sweetwater was super easy and quick. I contacted Sweetwater through Autotrader and was immediately contacted by Jerry with not only and updated price tag :) but also with current pictures of the truck. As everyone shops around when buying a car, nobody could touch the prices of Sweetwater. I drove out to Sweetwater with my trade in, arriving around 10:30. After a test drive with Danny and some paperwork, I was out of there by 1:00 with my new truck! 

Also, while we were talking, they mentioned numerous times that they are willing to deliver their vehicles and have delivered some pretty sweet rides (custom, limited edition mustangs) to people in Dallas and even North Carolina!

212,"October 06, 2015","It appears that Cars.com is censoring honest real Dealer reviews, so it seemed appropriate to post here.

I drove over 600 miles to purchase what I thought was a 2010 370Z Touring roadster based on the pictures and the title of the ad on cars.com.
 
I had negotiated a suitable price for the car and was looking forward to driving the vehicle home.

I arrived at the Stanley Ford Sweetwater to find that the dealership had mislabeled the vehicle as the Touring model when in fact the vehicle was the Base model with the sport package, a much different vehicle and a less expensive one. 

The Touring version of this vehicle has power seats. The vehicle I drove did not. 

The Touring version of this car has drilled aluminum pedals. This vehicle did not. 

The Touring version of this car has net cargo pockets behind the seats. This vehicle did not. 

I've checked the specs on the 2010 Nissan 370Z roadster Touring model and the vehicle I saw was not the Touring model. 

The salesman simply said that he was ""sorry I drove 600 miles"" to buy a vehicle that Stanley Ford of Sweetwater had incorrectly labeled as a 2010 Nissan 370Z Touring edition vehicle. 

Some courts of law call that ""material misrepresentation"" or ""detrimental reliance"" or FALSE ADVERTISING. 

This seems to be the worst kind of ""bait and switch"" scam that dealers are putting out there these days.

214,"February 16, 2011","I am a single mother & men showed up at my door saying I won 1 of 6 substantial prizes.I took off work to claim the prize & after I could not buy a car they gave me $2.In today's age of technology they should not use hard sale tactics on consumers. I explained to the men that I was a single mother & would have to take off work to claim the prize & they assured me the smallest prize was a $500 wal-mart gift certificate, which I could have really used for my 2 young children.  Since I only make $50 a day it was a no brainer to go since they assured me I had to buy nothing.  They kept trying to sell me something then gave me $2. I just left crying because I felt so stupid that I fell for such a scam.  Why prey on single mothers?  It is hard enough on us as it is.  I guess they have no morals so beware because if they are dis-honest in the small things they will be dis-honest in the large!",1.3
215,"September 06, 2006","After a week of nothing but frustrations from my local Ford dealer, I contacted Stanley Ford Mercury in Sweetwater, hoping to find a particular car I was looking for.  Salesman Synuwae Bryant answered the phone, and told me that they did not in fact have the car I was looking for (a 2006 Mustang V6 convertible), but he wanted my business and was willing to try to find me one.  I decided to give him a chance (despite my frustrations with salesmen at the dealership up the road).  He found the car. And he flew to Kansas to get it for me!  The whole deal took only a few days, and I was able to beat the deadline for the Labor Day 0% financing promo!  The Sales Manager Damon was exceptionally kind as well.  I have absolutely nothing but praises for the staff at Stanley Ford Mercury in Sweetwater.  Customer Service, Professionalism, Friendliness, going above and beyond the normal boundaries of service - that's the crew at Stanley Ford.  It's definitely worth the drive to Sweetwater!  Ask for Synuwae Bryant.  His customer service can't be beaten.",5.0
