Even though it was late in the evening he added that, plus an oil change and a tire rotation I was surprised to get all tos done in less than an hour and a half. ",4.6
13,"August 08, 2019","I have taken my company vehicle about 5 times - I paid for oil change that was never completed , so I have to complain to manager and get it corrected. 2nd issue i- had rotars  and brakes done - I take it to another mechanic  and find out they  finnigan did not so it correctly and left some bolts off. I contacted Jammie (service manager) and he said directors would not refund or pay for the other shop to fix it. Bottom line their service department is horrible,  waist of money and time - strongly suggest go somewhere else.",1.0

26,"May 09, 2018","I have to admit, I was very anxious to hear something about my car on the first day in the shop. It was making a noise that was a challenge to figure out where it was coming from. On day two in the shop, I was set up with a loaner car which helped me considerably since there were doctor appointments that needed to be kept. Not having the parts that were needed for my car at the dealership, there was a wait for them to come in from Dallas. Adam, my service representative, was very good at keeping me informed with the day to day progress of my car. ",5.0

31,"October 06, 2017"," When I called to make a service appointment I was placed on hold for a few minutes during which time I heard about the Friday Special Oil Change for $12.95.  When my call was answered I asked for a Friday appointment but was advised that Friday's are very busy and hectic days but since I purchased the vehicle from Finnegan my oil changes would ALWAYS be $12.95.  I then made the appointment for Thursday.

I also told the service adviser that I had received a mailer last week from GMC/Finnegan with an oil change coupon..one minor problem, it had expired the first week of September.  I received no explanation for this but was again reminded that my oil changes would ALWAYS be $12.95.

Imagine my surprise when I looked at the bill.  When I questioned why it was not $12.95 I was told that the Yukon needed more oil.  Finnegan knew it was a Yukon when I made the appointment but still told me $12.95.

And just to make sure my experience was a bad one my vehicle was returned to me unwashed.

If a dealership wants to sell me new vehicles in the future hen this is not he level of service I expect.
