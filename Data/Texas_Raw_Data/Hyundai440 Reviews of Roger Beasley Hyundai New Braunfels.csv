2,"December 20, 2017","This was the second time we've dropped our car off for an oil change, and both times we have been treated as if we're inconveniencing them. The service workers are not friendly, and they do the bare minimum to service the car. The day after I had my oil changed, my washer fluid light came on. I have never had my oil changed at other places and NOT had them top off all fluids, but they clearly did not do so this go around. It leaves me wondering what else they didn't do. One of the key decision makers in us purchasing this car (at the Kyle location) was the convenience and proximity of the New Braunfels location for service. However, that has turned out to be more of an aggravation than it's worth--to the point that I don't think we'll by another Hyundai, because I'm not buying a car to be treated like we have been at this location.",1.0

11,"December 10, 2017","Everyone at Roger Beasley was very friendly. They made us feel at home. During a brief wait, we struck up a conversation with one of the other salesmen about cars in general. He was very relaxed and attentive but politely discontinued the conversation when our salesperson returned with paperwork. We felt no pressure at all and we're very pleased with the way everything was handled.",5.0

18,"November 25, 2017",The experience I received from the dealership and especially due to Ricky's personal service left me very satisfied..  Only issue was the pricing of course could have been better but not at all disappointed,4.8
19,"November 22, 2017","I completed a motor vehicle buyer's order to purchase a 2016 Hyundai and provided the dealership with the information necessary to process my purchase and complete the financing. Since the sale occurred on a Saturday, they did not submit the purchase order to my credit union until Monday. Just as I finalized the loan documents on Monday, the salesperson called to say they decided to sell the car to someone else. This type of business practice is highly unethical and was likely a breach of contract. The dealership itself was unapologetic. The salesperson was apologetic and tried to direct me to a different vehicle, but  the price was not nearly as competitive as the original vehicle. It felt a lot like a bait and switch situation.",1.0
20,"November 22, 2017","I knew what I wanted to go in and look at. They gave me the option to look at other vehicles, but didn't push me one way or the other. I was able to test drive on the highway and through town. Everything was explained in detail and if the sales rep did not know the answer she found someone who did.",5.0
21,"November 22, 2017",Most everything as done before I got to the dealership. I basically had to sign the papers and drive away. Gary explain everything on the new car in detail. I really enjoy having all the manuals for my new car. I also appreciate the tour of the building he took us on.,4.8

24,"November 11, 2017","As a first time car buyer I knew the process would be long. There was no stress, everything was fully explained, and even though it took about 4 hours there wasn't much time sitting around doing nothing.",5.0
25,"November 10, 2017",Best car buying experience in 30 years! I look forward to buying a car from Rodger Beasley in the future! Ms. Sydna Hunter was very helpful!,5.0

28,"November 02, 2017","I had a great car buying, well, leasing experience at Roger Beasley Hyundai. Everyone was very nice and welcoming. I never once felt pressured to commit just well informed about the current deals. Which is good as if I'm pressured I'm gone. From J.B. to Jared to Chris, everyone pitched in to make me happy and this deal happening!! They even moved my belongings to the new car while I was with the finance mgr (also very nice) as I was a bit in a time crunch. Overall I am very satisfied and will definitely recommend them to my friends and family.",4.8
29,"October 27, 2017",I have bought five new cars in five different states over a period of 58 years. This purchase was by far the best.  Two of those cars I drove for 12 and 15 years.,5.0
30,"October 26, 2017",We made the entire deal over the phone! All we had to do was show up and sign papers. Even after us having run into a slight problem they still accommodated us,5.0
31,"October 25, 2017","The sales people that I worked with were very patient, kind and thoughtful which I much appreciate!  It was a very stressful time for me but they made it as painless as possible.  They have also followed through after the sale to see that all is well and ask if I have questions.  I would definitely recommend this dealership!  Especially if you work with Tony or Gary!!",5.0
32,"October 24, 2017","I wanted to let the dealership know that my purchase of my new 2017 Sonata then to my 2018 Hyundai Sonata Sport was probably one of the most grueling and financially painful events I have ever endured.  That said, I could not have asked for any better dealership team.  I think that considering the circumstances, Roger Beasley's staff tried very hard to get me switched out from the first vehicle that I purchased. It was a very difficult situation for everyone involved but the bottom line is they got me out the door with a beautiful vehicle (the Sport) and I LOVE it.  It is the third vehicle we purchase in 2 years and I plan on going back when the next time comes around!  To Ricky and Kimber... thank you both so much for your patience. Rob, THANK you for explaining the coverages and helping me make the best decision so I am fully protected.  See you guys on tinting day! My mom will be buying her next vehicle from you guys.  :)",4.4
33,"October 19, 2017","I really enjoyed working with Chris.  I had been dreading spending a day with sharky salesmen, but Chris wasn't pushy at all.  I loved that he took the time to find out exactly what I wanted in a vehicle.  Then he looked at ALL the inventory to find exactly what I wanted.  He found one in Victoria for me.  I also liked that he treated me like a family member instead of a commission opportunity.  When he returned from Victoria with the car, he took the time to pair everything for me and showed me some of the features.  I really enjoyed the guy who did all the paperwork with me (I think his name is Austin) too.  He was cool and funny.   I'm a very loyal customer once you've won me over.  And from now on, Roger Beasley has all my business.",5.0
34,"October 18, 2017","I had an overall positive experience with my purchase, which was slightly ruined by them not returning my rental car on time, as promised. But the staff was otherwise friendly and accommodating",4.4
35,"October 13, 2017",Great sales person and great sales experience overall. Will definitely refer and do business again.  Thank you So much. Simple and not time consuming which was important since i was from out of town.,5.0
36,"October 13, 2017",wonderful. great service by sales person and managers. I would recommend this dealer to anyone and every one. I will go back to there when I need new car or need services.,5.0
37,"October 12, 2017",I've never had a car buying experience like this one. I spoke to Tony Rodriguez on the phone and explained to him what I wanted and he had everything waiting for me when I got there. He even delivered the car to my home with his wife since I came to the dealership alone. I will definitely return in the future.,5.0
38,"October 12, 2017","Not all situations are perfect, ours certainly was not. We were attempting to trade in two vehicles but were a little upside down on both. We had purchased a used vehicle from Jordan and felt confident he would lead us in the right direction. He introduced us to Ricky who helped us put together a plan to purchase one vehicle to put an end to the commuter miles I put on our other vehicle. As we continue paying down our other vehicle we will soon trade it in as well. Everyone was very professional and helpful. I would recommend these guys to anyone!",5.0

40,"October 10, 2017",I just purchased my 4th Hyundai over the last 8 years and this was by far the best car buying experience I have encountered.  Very knowledgeable of the product and its features.  Presented with a price which was the bottom line up front and no pressure.,5.0
41,"October 08, 2017",I don't understand why there is a twenty five word minimum for this review.  I like for reviews to be short.  Thank you Roger Beadly for an excellent purchase experience.,5.0
42,"October 06, 2017",Words can't express the great experience I had. The entire staff extremely pleasant. I'm very pleased with my purchase. I've raved about this dealership constantly upon returnin home to Houston. I researched dealerships between Houston & San Antonio. So glad followed my 1st thought.,5.0
43,"October 05, 2017","Comments provided earlier in this review. Traded my 2017 G80 for a 2018 G80 Sport. This should represent my satisfaction with the automobile, the manufacturer, the dealership and the salesman who was responsive to all my needs before, during and following the sale.",5.0
44,"October 03, 2017",Mr. Rodriguez went above and beyond for us. He was not pushy. Was very friendly. We never had this type of service when purchasing  vehicle. We definitely will be back.,5.0
45,"October 01, 2017",Best buying experience! Everything was set up on my vehicle so there was nothing else to do.

49,"September 27, 2017","The overall  experience was excellent with the Beasley Team. No high pressure sales or hide and seek tactics. Josh Leal, the Internet manager, and the Financial person were all great to work with. We appreciate Josh promptly returning our calls and checking out a couple items on the car, complete with a picture or two. Pricing on the vehicle was competitive and you had a variety to choose from.  Thank you again... we will come see you next time we are in the Market.",5.0
50,"September 26, 2017","Excellent dealership with very low sales pressure.  Everyone was very friendly.  Tony was the best! This was my first Hyundai, and  I will recommend this dealership.",5.0
51,"September 26, 2017",Courtney came in to help me even though she was not scheduled to work that day.  There was one more person that helped me with the financing aspect but I can't remember his name.  He was very patient with me.  I believe he worked in the pre-owned financing dept,4.5
52,"September 23, 2017",I absolutely could not be happier! Since the 1st time in many years I have not experienced any buyers remorse.  Gary was great in taking care of my questions.,5.0

55,"September 19, 2017","Chris was a great salesman. No pressure sales dealership and we shared some laughs. He treated my wife and I with respect and was more then helpful with us choosing the right commute car. Roger Beasley met our requests on trade in and discounts with a great financing option. Proudly we can say we bought our first Hyundai a 2017 Ioniq Hybrid here. Writing this review over a week from sale and zero issues with the car or the dealership. Oh yea, and we just put our first tank of gas in too after 600 miles. Yes, almost unbelievable MPG. Highly recommend them and the car too!",5.0
56,"September 14, 2017","Straight forward, honest, the dealership staff listened to us, and worked to meet our needs. We had financing from our bank and had not pressure to go with anyone else. Highly recommend this dealer.",5.0
57,"September 14, 2017","I really cannot say enough good things about my experience with this group of people. They are friendly, helpful, knowledgeable and do not use pressure or scare tactics.",4.8
58,"September 12, 2017","Most amazing experience ever! From the moment I stepped in, it was like being welcome home. Each member of their team warmly introduced themselves and let ME do the talking, which I appreciated. They started by asking me what I wanted, instead of trying to steer me in one direction or another. I was hesitant when coming to them, because I had already seen the World Car Hyundai North, in Live Oak. They didn't seem too honest (it just felt like they were keeping something from me, I didn't like it), they were abrupt and not as helpful as I had wanted. In contrast, at Beasley, they were extremely transparent about what they could and couldn't help me with. They didn't show me their little ""overview"" sheet, they immediately whipped out the line-by-line, so I could see there were no hidden fees. I ended up with the price I wanted, the car I wanted, and I couldn't be happier. Thank you all!!",5.0
59,"September 12, 2017","Great sales people, great prices up front. They don't play games with the pricing and try to squeeze every last dime from you. Go visit them!  You won't be disappointed.",5.0

61,"September 05, 2017","Buyer BEWARE! I am appalled at the blatantly deceptive, unethical & illegal  business practices that were used on my family. My son's young & inexperienced family visited the New Braunfels Roger Beasley Hyundai hoping to buy a used vehicle. They were victims of several textbook scams such as ""spot delivery"" & ""yo-yo financing"".These scams were intentionally perpetrated & designed to prey upon those with bad or no credit & discriminatory in nature.As well, they falsely represented information in order to obtain financing & used the ""Straw Purchase"" scam after exhausting all other attempts to finalize the sale. After putting $3,000 down on a vehicle, the contract wasn't even put in the couple's name.The co-signer was listed as the primary buyer,  the terms of the loan had been changed &  expensive service contracts & insurance were added all without consent. Their actions were criminal & they violated the Unfair & Deceptive Trade Practices Act (UDAP). We have reported them to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in hopes of saving others from the kind of fraudulent misrepresentation we experienced. On the 10th day of driving the vehicle, the salesman called in the middle of a workday & demanded they bring the vehicle back within the hour or the police would be called. The dealership was unable to obtain financing & wanted out of the deal. A deal they initiated & that was presented as a final sale to the buyers. Who treats customers like this?  The young couple had to fight to get their $3,000 down payment returned & were treated like criminals through no fault of their own. My hope is that through my many complaints,  government regulators will investigate this dealerships regulatory violations & put a stop to the fraud before there are any more victims!",1.0
62,"September 02, 2017","Run, don't walk, to this dealership.  Honest, straightforward, no-nonsense. It was the best car buying experience I've ever had. I would highly recommend this dealership to any of my family and friends.",5.0
63,"August 31, 2017","This guy does everything he can to get you exactly what you're looking for. As we patiently awaited the 2018s he kept in constant touch and found the exact vehicle we wanted! There was no pressure. No sly sales gimmicks, just a good guy trying to sell you a great car.",5.0
64,"August 30, 2017",Very nice and courtesy employees that I had contact with. Will recommend dealership and friends to Roger Beasley Hyundai New Braunfels.  Keep up the great work!,5.0
65,"August 29, 2017","Jordan was wonderful to work with. I told him what I was looking for and he found me the perfect car. We did all the back and forth before I even got to the dealership, so all I had to do was sign the papers and drive off. Everyone at the dealership was extremely helpful.",5.0
66,"August 27, 2017",tony took very good care of me and explained all features of the vehicle. negotiating the price on the car was hassle free for me,4.8
67,"August 26, 2017","We were extremely happy working with this dealership and are very likely to return in the future!!! From the moment we walked in the door to the time we left after signing papers, it was a great experience and we couldn't be more pleased with how it went!!",5.0
68,"August 25, 2017",These employees deserve raises. They went above and beyond for us. We been shopping for 6 months and finally found something we like. They did a fantastic job. My wife and and have I already discussed our next purchase for April.,4.6

71,"August 19, 2017",As stated my over all experience with the Roger Beasley Hyundai New Bruanfels dealership was very positive.  I liked the relaxed feel of the place.  All the employee's were very nice.  I didn't feel like I was being pressured to make a deal.  It felt like a small time dealership rather than a big city dealership and this really appealed to me.,5.0
72,"August 19, 2017","The atmosphere is friendly and you are greeted when you walk in the door.  When I first arrived and asked to see a specific car that I thought was on the lot, I found that it had been sold.  Sargent D, the sales lady,  and Ricky, the sales manager, helped me find a car that met all of my requirements and fit my budget.  Ricky, had worked with my husband previously on the lease of new Hyundai, and we found him to be friendly, honest, and easy to work with.   He is the reason I returned to Hyundai and I had one of the most satisfying experiences I have had when buying a car.  When I or my husband or ready to purchase or lease a new car we will return to the New Braunfels dealership.",5.0

90,"July 20, 2017","I had a wonderful experience buying a car with Chris as my sales person, very personable and willing to help in anyway possible. I highly recommend anyone wishing to make a purchase at this site to use Chris. I also highly disapprove of the way the store in Kyle handled their business.

92,"July 15, 2017","Our salesman, Jordan Miller, was extremely courteous and professional and answered all our questions. He is an excellent salesman in that he did NOT attempt to pressure us into purchasing anything beyond what we told him we were looking for. The finance manager (whose name, unfortunately, I don't remember) was similarly low-key, professional, and courteous. He explained each aspect of the Roger Beasley Rewards program to us thoroughly. This is the most pleasant, least stressful car-buying experience I have ever had.",5.0

234,"October 15, 2016","What an awesome dealership!  
After spending 2 weeks looking at different vehicles, new & used..... I chose the HYUNDAI Sante Fe at Roger Beasley HYUNDAI in New Braunfels. 

We had narrowed our selection down to the Ford Edge but decided to stop and check our HYUNDAI. We were so glad we did as the moment we met Chris Garcia, we were both so impressed with his knowledge of the product as well as willingness to actually listen to our needs. 

So many of the dealerships we visited only wanted to talk or listen to my husband, even though he repeatedly told them the vehicle was for me.   Chris listened carefully and made sure he understood what I needed and wanted. 
We were impressed with his love for HYUNDAI and learned his father was a finance manager for HYUNDAI for many years at a different dealership. 

The HYUNDAI Sante Fe caught my eye right away and I was impressed with both interior options as well as the size and look of the SUV on the exterior.  After driving so many small SUV's,  test driving this car really impressed us both. 

Chris encouraged us to take the Sante Fe  home for the nights & the Sales Manager Ricky Beaty quickly agreed. That was it.... once we had a chance to spend more time driving and checking out the options of the vehicle, we were sold.  The only challenge was deciding on the entire color. I loved the two-tone interiors of the Sante Fe but the grey/charcoal was not on the lot in the Sante Fe Turbo Sport that I wanted. 

Chris and Ricky quickly went to work finding me the exterior Pearl White with the grey interior that I really wanted  instead of pushing one on their lot and Chris drove after hours to Roundrock to get it for me. 

I can't say enough about this young man.
Go meet Chris !!He is very impressive,  a great communicator, very personable and knowledgeable. But most of all.... he actually listened instead of trying to sell me something on his agenda.  

They were able to make me a good deal on my 2007 Chevrolet Corvette I was trading in. I decided to finance the vehicle because of the additional rebate and worked with Rob Galvan, who really took the time to explain the incredible warranties that HYUNDAI offered. 
Actually the warranty was a huge factor in comparing Ford to the HYUNDAI. 

We also had a chance to work with Jordan Miller to finalize some of the paperwork. 
He was awesome as well and really went out if his way to make sure we were well taken care of. 

All in all Roger Beasley HYUNDAI is an impressive dealership and we would highly encourage you to check out this dealership at 485 N IH 35 in New Braunfels. You won't be disappointed!

Our many thanks to each person we worked with. What a blessing!

256,"September 09, 2016","1a. At several dealerships I test drove a Kia Optima and several Hyundais. (I also long-term rented both a 2014 Optima and a 2015 Tucson.) 1b. I thoroughly reviewed, studied and test drove 3 types of Hyundais - Sonata, Santa Fe and Tucson. 1c. I finalized on Hyundai (again - 6 times, now!).  2a. In the past I've had an Accent, 2 Sonatas, a Santa Fe and an Azera. 2b. You have greatly improved and upgraded all of these. 2c. The Santa Fe is much more stabilized than before - I didn't like how previously it tended to top-sway in maneuvers. Previously, the Tucson was more stiff, boxy and also swayed more. It was not a comfortable ride and the interior seemed more like a super economy car. Now, even the the entry level is smooth, comfortable and classy. 3A. AS MENTIONED BEFORE TO HYUNDAI: I really do wish Hyundai would make a Sonata Touring (not referring to a hatchback). You had a Touring/Tourer with the Elantra. 3b. The MPG lowers substantially from the Sonata to the Tucson - which I don't like. 3c. I really do like my new 2016 Tucson. I equally liked the Sonata and Santa Fe. I chose the Tucson over the Sonata for more space (but I really like the Sonata), and chose the Tucson over the Santa Fe because of MPG and the SF was more space than I need on a daily bases.",5.0

She was so incredibally patient with me and redid the numbers for me multiple times so I knew what all my options were. She explained everything to me and there were no suprises when we reached the final number. She never looked down on or tried to bully me like other finance people had at other dealers.

My experience at Roger Beasley Hyundai started with Carlos's initial call to me. I had considered RB Hyundai only peripherally, since it is a longer drive for me than other dealerships. That said, Carlos was, from the start, professional and courteous, and it was after that call that I decided to make the trip out to Roger Beasley Hyundai first. Carlos (and the sales manager - I regret that I can't remember his name. Rick, maybe?) were friendly, transparent, and informative. My experience is not what I think that people are conditioned to expect from the buying experience, and that's definitely a good thing.

No one pressured me and there was no silly back and forth haggling between my salesman and his manager.  I told them what I wanted and got more than I asked for.  I was even able to walk out the door and spend two weeks thinking about my potential purchase.  I contacted two other dealers via email to compare prices and all I got back from them was pressure to come in and talk.  I told them exactly what I wanted in the vehicle and all I required was a number.  I never got the number and consequently they will not do business with me in the future.  Because of the way that Jordan handled my questions and his easy going attitude, it was a foregone conclusion that he would sell me my vehicle.  I feel good about it and I know I got a quality vehicle that is backed up by a quality dealership that cares about my needs and respects my time.  
I test drove another vehicle that was not Hyundai and I had some questions on it.  Jordan found the salesman that personally handled the transaction for that vehicle and let me speak to him.  Carlos answered my questions and put my mind at ease.  I chose the Hyundai but got needed attention in order to make the smarter choice!

When I set up financing, it was just a breeze.  I made an appointment, sent in needed paperwork early and it was ready for signatures when I got there.  There was no games or pressure to take anything extra that I didn't want.  When I said NO, it was accepted and we moved ahead.  Beautiful transaction from beginning to end.",5.0

The salesman was always professional and extremely knowledgable about all the vehicles we looked at.

He was able explain all the features of the car without saying ""I don't know "" to any of the questions.  He was the only salesman that could do that including other Hyundai dealers we visited prior to going to Roger Beasley.",5.0
