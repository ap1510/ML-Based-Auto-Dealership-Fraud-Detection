67,"July 04, 2019","This is my third vehicle from this dealer and next year I'll get another one.

Great customer service - from the moment I pulled up to the Service entrance -- it feels like I'm at a friend's house -- a smile and a wave good morning from Jorge.

I get out and walk to the counter - Ruben is already pulling up my information in the system.

Less than a minute and I'm handing the key to Jorge.

Three minutes later I'm in the waiting area enjoying coffee.  Less than 20 minutes I'm standing in front of Dianna -- signing a warranty document.

I turn to look out the window and I'm just in time to watch my truck exit the carwash.

As I'm leaving the parking lot - I have the good fortune of running in to Shane.  A hearty handshake, a wonderful update on his daughter and a quick fib from me about catching big fish at Lake Nacogdoches and I'm off to enjoy my day.

Today - i didn't have a need for Courtesy Transportation but when I do -- it's always my pleasure to talk with Rafael.

As I mentioned -- it feels like dropping in at a friend's house and asking them to -- take a look at my truck.

Outstanding customer service/support.

3 hours later they gave me a $290 bill and claimed to have fixed it. Before i left the parking lot i realized they didnt do crap.
I turned around and told them to fix it. They then said i needed a new engine mount ($160) and it will take 6 hrs of labor. Total being $719.
So i went to an auto parts store, bought an engine mount for $90 and replaced it in just under 3 hours. 
I am not a certified mechanic, i dont have a lift, and i dont have a dozen other people around to help me. 
So, they tried to screw me on labor, and cost of parts. And then they charged me $290 to run a diagnostic and replace the oxygen sensor  (which i did NOT ask them to do)
