5,"March 10, 2020","Our experience at Big Star Honda was outstanding! After looking for a vehicle online I called Big Star to see if it was still for sale. 
Lee Creech answered said come on over, it was parked and waiting for us ten minutes later. Test driving was a breeze and service was excellent! Our plans were to take a test drive and think about our options but Mr Creech not only sold us our new family vehicle but earned our business! Thank you Big Star for your outstanding service!",5.0

15,"January 10, 2020",We purchased a certified pilot. They could have explained the certification better. They also took way to long with the transaction. We were also missing a remote for the dvd.

17,"January 03, 2020","Do not trust anything these people say and DEFINITELY DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM! I purchased a used 2017 vehicle from Rene Rodriguez in August of 2019 only to discover, after taking it to a dealership in Austin, that the vehicle could not have passed a Texas inspection. Rene at Big Star Honda had very ""generously"" sold me an extended bumper to bumper warranty that covered anything ""bumper to bumper"" for an extra $2500. So, hearing the news that my new car needed work, I thought, no problem—I've got an excellent warranty (through AWS). Turns out that they covered absolutely 0% of the cost of a new catalytic converter, wheel bearings and brakes! Needless to say, I wouldn't recommend giving any business with Big Honda. They have horrendous customer service. I've called multiple times to ask about the warranty and sale of a car that didn't pass inspection and they've given me the run around, handing me off from person to person with no progress ever being made.

23,"November 05, 2019","I visited the dealership on 11/5/2019 for a scheduled appointment after speaking with both William in pre-owned sales and one of the managers named Mike. They both confirmed the availability of the vehicle I inquired about. Prior to my arrival, William committed to calling me back with answers to a few questions I had about the vehicle. When I did not immediately hear back from him as promised (allegedly due to him being with another customer), I was transferred to Mike who stated the car was being serviced. He assured me the vehicle was still available for purchase despite some discrepancies I sought to clarify. Since I was already in the area on business, I kept my scheduled appointment. Shortly after arriving, I was told that William was with a customer. After waiting for about five minutes, I finally met William who asked what did Mike tell me about the car. I found this to be quite odd as Mike indicated that William came to him for the second key during our earlier call. William claimed that he never spoke to Mike but this didn't make sense. Why else would he ask me about the conversation between Mike and me if they'd never spoken. After a brief charade with William (he was fidgety, avoided eye contact, and had a shaky voice), he soon confessed that the car actually was not at the dealership because it had been sent to auction...typical bait and switch to lure a customer to the dealership in hopes of selling a different vehicle. This infuriated me to say the least and certainly shows a lack of integrity in both men. I will NEVER return to this dealership, nor would I recommend them to anyone. They should have been honest from the beginning and simply shared that the vehicle was no longer available. This dealership also falsely advertised that this was a one owner vehicle when the CarFax clearly showed two previous owners. People like William and Mike perpetuate a lack of trust between buyers and dealerships. Utterly shameful...",1.0

67,"March 06, 2019",Disappointing that guarantees on price and rates made by sales staff weren’t verified and increased when it came time for financing. Made for a lot of unnecessary confusion.

72,"February 25, 2019","I give 2 stars very generously. The process did not go as smoothly as I would have liked, from the time I walked in, to the time I left. Most of the salesmen seem to have a nonchalant attitude as if I were not a buying customer. Before I drove to the dealership, I made several attempts to reach someone to help me with a particular vehicle, all of them unsuccessful and never received what I needed(point of contact at that time, Helen, seemed not to care that I did not receive what was needed) . I tried to schedule an appointment online, was unsuccessful with that also. Finally I gave up and drove from Richmond/ Rosenberg area to the dealership, only to find out that the car I was interested in was not there, or so we thought. No one could give a definite answer on anything. This was frustrating and unorganized. The sales associate seemed ok for the most part, until I asked her a question and she laughed in my face. The detail job on the cat I purchased, seemed rushed and half done. Had to get it detailed myself the next day. The smoothest part seemed to be the lady in the finance department. She was truly professional and helpful (probably the only reason why I went through with the entire process). As someone whom owns their own business and has worked on hospitality for over 12 years, this place sure could use some. I have purchased vehicles there before, back when it was McDavid, and the difference is like night and day. McDavid cared about people that walked through the door (so much so that they would meet you outside)  and big star seemed nonchalant about people that walk through the door.",1.4

96,"August 26, 2018","Most dishonest and deceitful behaviour from a dealership. Hide facts and pass on costs behind.
Play of words like we will throw in 2 years service and pass a hidden fee of $99 within the sales contract. Later on it was found this was added in the documentation fee in the invoice.

97,"August 26, 2018","I went to the dealership yesterday (8/18/2018) and I wasn’t even expecting to be buying, although I was quite prepared to if the right vehicle caught my eye. Personally, I’ve been looking to purchase a Honda Accord, and little did I know that yesterday would be the day. After a test drive I was mesmerized by how remarkable the ride felt. It was a quiet ride, although if I wanted to I had the option to switch the car into sport mode for a bit more noise. Though, the car that I test drove wasn’t exactly what I was looking for regarding the color. Not a problem apparently because they carried the same exact car in a midnight blue. The sales rep waited no less than a second to go get the car I was looking for and he was back within 5 minutes with the car I would soon be driving out of the lot with. My father spoke from experience that Honda usually doesn’t stray too far away from the price of their vehicles and the appraisal value of a trade-in. When we spoke to the sales rep about getting a deal, he worked with us and shaved off about $1k on the vehicle’s window price and including the cost of fill ups on tires. Also, the cost of a trade-in was just a little too low for my liking, at first. The rep went and talked to whoever he needed to talk to and came back with an offer for my trade-in the was absolutely perfect! I went ahead and signed all of the paperwork and was then lead to financing. The wait was a bit long, but it was worth it and besides, it was late Saturday evening. ",5.0

123,"March 23, 2018","This place has probably the worst customer service. We are a big Toyota family and we decided to give Honda a chance with a new CRV. My father had spoken to sales person days prior and was promised a set price of $25,000. When we came the sales person tried to sell us the SAME car for $30,000!!! The NERVE. He was very disrespectful and insulted my mom. The sales person is Felipe Canales. Do NOT go to him! He would cut off my dad when he was trying to negotiate a price with him, super unprofessional. Before we got into numbers we were promised the rubber floor mats. After we picked up the car the rubber floor mats were not there. Not only were the floor mats not there our car had a huge oil stain in the passenger seat. We called Big Star Honda to ask for them and we were put on hold 3 times and those 3 times they hung up on us. After they finally picked up Felipe told us that they lost too much money on our sale and that if we really wanted the floor mats we'd have to pay $200 for them when we were clearly promised them regardless of what we ended up paying for the car. If they really lost too much money we'd be more than happy to return the car and get our money back. There are plenty of dealers who'd be happy to assist us. It's safe to say we're NEVER going back to Honda or this location",1.2

154,"November 07, 2017","I would put 0 stars except they had the car I wanted in the color I wanted which was hard to find at other dealerships. So I added 1 star for that. In my entire life, I’ve never given below a 3 Star for anything. Overall, it was a horrible experience. I felt that they were taking advantage of hurricane Harvey victims and of the demand on cars since Harvey had flooded out millions of cars in Houston. I’ve owned 5 Hondas so far.  I’m obviously a repeat customer.  This was the worst experience of them all. 

The internet sales person (who seemed straight forward and nice, but was powerless in terms of negotiating sales price) said they’d match any other offers we received, however upon trying to negotiate price, he was only willing to offer $60 off MSRP. Manager offered about $300 off. Even the General Manager only went up to $600. The GM is really the person who makes me livid when I think back to this experience. I got an internet offer from another dealership for $2,300 off MSRP. GM said there was no VIN number associated with the deal so it wasn’t legitimate. He said “anyone can put an email together with an offer”. In other words, he implied I was committing fraud by forging an offer from another dealership. He also called my spouse “baby”.  

They also kept trying to add on various fees/services.  Since the car was just delivered that day, none of the usual dealership add-ons had been added on, and we chose to not have them added on, yet they were trying to charge us for them. The GM said that even though the feature has not been added on, we still had to pay for it because the dealership has paid for it. They added the Destination fee on twice. The Destination is already included in the MSRP price.  For confirmation, you can see it on the Honda website. I’m willing to pay the Destination fee, of course, just not twice. 

By the end of the night, the sales guy wouldn’t even look me in the eyes. I also had to come back later because they didn’t complete the state inspection prior to sending me home with the car. I do not recommend this dealership. ",1.2

The auto body shop said the car had already been worked on previously, before I bought it. It had been re-painted and there had been body damage so a side panel was removed and repainted. The work was shoddy too and there was a small paint drip I never noticed. The paint was not fully blended and buffed and they did not remove the side window to properly paint the side. I got a quote to get the car repaired properly and it is $2100, not including rental car fees for up to two weeks. Needless to say this was NOT disclosed to me before I bought the vehicle. I had called the manager about this but only got a voicemail and my call was not returned. I am pursuing this unethical behavior with the Better Business Bureau and small claims if I need to.

He told me I was ""not a man of [my] word"" even though I never told him we were buying the car.

303,"December 31, 2014","My husband and I bought new 2015 Honda CR-V LX at Big Star Honda today, and we had the worst buying experience ever. 

This was our second CR-V purchase (from somewhere else), so we knew how the whole process was going to be. We got several competitive out-the-door quotes from different places, but I decided to go to Big Star Honda because I had a good interaction with Mr. Zafar Ali Khan via e-mail/phone, who is very nice and honest, and because he said he will either match or beat the offer I got from another dealership. But the following is our experience:

1. NEGOTIATING PRICE

As I was told that he can at least match, if not beat, the drive-out offer I got from another dealership, I expected that to happen. I was pretty open about the price, so Mr. Zafar already knew what price I wanted. When we walked in, however, thing happened were not what we anticipated to happen. First of all, the salesman failed to even match the price I brought from another dealership. He told me that his manager will not allow that (although it was just $200 lower that what he quoted me). Secondly, the managers claimed that we have to pay extra $698 ($299 for identity theft protection + $399 for something unnecessary that I don't remember what exactly it was) because this car comes with these two options. At first, his manager and general manager told us that these options cannot be taken off from the car and that we HAVE TO pay for them. After we told them that we're going somewhere else because we do not want to pay for these extra fees, then they finally negotiated to take off these options and honor the quote they offered at first, but they said there will be no price-matching. We knew the managers lied to us about this car already having the two options on them that could not be taken out, but we decided to buy the car only because Mr. Zafar was trying to help us to get what he initially promised us. We were not 100% satisfied with the price of the car because it is not what was promised via e-mail, but it was okay because things got MUCH worsen afterwards!! Continue reading.

2. FINANCING THROUGH BIG STAR HONDA

We walked into the financing manager named Tuyen Tran, who made our experience the worst dealership experience ever! First, the only reason we wanted to finance through Honda dealership was that they advertised to give 0.9% APR for 60 months for 2015 Honda CR-V's. I even screen-captured this on my phone as a proof. Tuyen said that they cannot to 0.9% APR on 2015 CR-V's. Oh, Really? Then why do you guys false-advertise on your website? This ""deal"" was on their website for at least the past two weeks, and he said that there is no such deal even if the website says so.

Now, both my husband and I knew our credit score was pretty good (A or A- grade depending on credit company), but Tuyen said ""your credit score is bad, so we cannot give you a good financing rate."" The first offer he gave us is 5.99%. When we asked him if there is any way to lower the interest rate, he said he cannot because it is based on our credit. So we decided to go to two other banks where both banks offered us VERY competitive interest rates. The lowest interest rates we got was 1.86% for 60 months, so we were planning to finance through Chase. On the same day, Tuyen called me and told me that he can try to match that rate I got from other bank, so we thought we should give it a try because he called us and promised to us. We went back to Big Star Honda, and the first word came out of Tuyen's mouth was, ""We can only give you 2.49%, and you must finance through us to buy this car. That is the rule."" REALLY? IS THAT REALLY WHAT HE SAID? 

We gave him a chance to make up, but he is a complete liar. He promised us to match the low interest we got from Chase, but when we came in he said we either go with 2.49% interest with them (Honda) or bring the car back. I was so upset that I came out of that office and told Mr. Zafar that I will return the car because that is what the financing manager wants. 

This is not the end; Tuyen told my husband that 1). he can lower the interest rate to 2.14% but he will have to increase the car price, 2). if not increase the price, then we will have to add GAP for this rate, and 3) bring the car back if you don't want to accept these.
After I came back into the office with Mr. Zafar, then Tuyen told Mr. Zafar that he will take care of it and we will be satisfied. ""Satisfied? No, I am not satisfied with this,"" I said. Then the manager asked me what I want. I told him exactly what I told him over the phone which was that we will get the rate we got from Chase. Finally, we he worked this out with attitude, and I will never ever ever want to work with this kind of despicable person.

SUMMARY

Go to Big Star Honda only if:
- you don't mind their dishonesty and ""bad"" surprises with hidden fees
- you are used to at getting treated like the way I was treated by the financing manager (bunch of lies, false-advertisement, false-promising, and lies!!!!)

I did not mean to say anything bad about Mr. Zafar Ali Khan because he is very nice and helpful. However, this dealership is awful.",1.4
304,"December 30, 2014","We saw a 2012 Honda Odyssey online and called the dealership.  We asked if we could drive that specific car and was told we could.  When we got to the dealership less than 30 minutes later, we were told the car was not there, but they had models that were older and a lot of used cars were being shipped from Dallas.  After excusing himself to talk to the manager, the dealer returned 20 minutes later.  We were then asked if we wanted a new car.  We were then quizzed about how much money we were looking to spend or the maximum monthly payment we were looking at.  When we said that we were going to trade in our present car, we were asked a lot of questions and the dealer asked if he could have the key so his service department could appraise it.  We waited for the dealer to return for another 20 minutes.  After being at the dealership for 50 minutes and not even seeing  a car to test drive, we asked for our key back and left.

We feel that we were disrespected and our time was wasted.  We feel that every trick and story was used to keep us there in the hopes that we would buy a vehicle.  We will not be calling back to see if any other Honda Odyssey will be delivered.  There are many car dealerships in Houston and this dealership is one of the worst we have encountered in showing customers respect.

I was told you would give top dollar and I explained it was not in top condition. The girl insisted I came down and I would not be disappointed in the offer and they could set me up in a new vehicle of the same model for the same payment. I took my valuable time to drive an hour from work in traffic to be there and everything changed when I got there. I have to say you are running a good scam. I did not fall for it though. I had been up since 6AM that morning and was very tired. Of course my car was what you wanted but it needed more than expected, surprise!!!!! Bullshit!!! You then offer to buy it for $6,000.00 less than what I owe and proceed to try to put me in a newer model with less options for a payment of $220.00 more than what I am paying!!! Now I have to drive 50+ miles home and I am not happy at all, I did not even want to sell my car but your people insisted I would be in a newer model and paying the same amount.

314,"July 10, 2014","Hello All Listen up THIS IS AN IMPORTANT SERVICE MESSAGE from an extremely satisfied new car owner! I am from the west Texas area of midland/ Odessa many I am sure know we have been booming with the oil/gas industry here, However with a BOOM to the industry comes a BUST to the pocket book the cost of EVERYTHING and I do mean Everything has risen beyond belief practically overnight. I started looking about 3 months ago for a new car stepping out of my suv (since my boys have cars of their own now) I test drove several in my area and started really doing some research to assure I got everything I wanted in a vehicle as well as one that would last hold value and I would not regret in 2 years like my Mitsubishi outlander (remember you get what you pay for)! Well I came to the conclusion I wanted to purchase a sedan I narrowed it down between a Toyota camary and HONDA ACCORD both exl trim levels. They are pretty comparable cars until you really look at the quality of the workmanship that is put into them as well as the added extras Honda includes in their standard packages. But man the price was over what I was looking to spend. I tried to do some wheeling and dealing but you know how much can you ask a salesperson to go down when you know you are ready to purchase the BEST car made, I mean really without being offensive? Well I called dealers from 5 major areas away from me to get pricing quotes and some were not so helpful and friendly however when I called the last one BIG STAR HONDA IN HOUSTON I was put in touch with a sales woman named Sasha Najar. I explained my situation of being here and searching for the best possible deal on the car my heart was set on! She was eager to go to her lot take pictures and text them to me since I do not like giving out my email! She did my lot shopping for me. And did it with such an energy I didn’t even have! I arranged financing through my local bank and I knew what amount I was approved for but no one else did and when Sasha asked I refused her that information! That didn’t change her attitude towards me one bit. after all the run ins with over powering bullying sales people I was a real tough cookie and was not going to be bullied into getting anything I didn’t want or need. Nor giving any information I wasn’t comfortable with. She found me the car I wanted in the color with the trim level in a matter of hours now to figure out the rest and get over my 24 hr. buyers excitement she followed up to see if there was anything I needed or if I needed her assistance further. No way did I feel she was pressuring me just being very helpful she asked questions to try to help me get best financing for my situation but when I explained it was done just had to find the car she said good thing I found it for you then and she was right. I bluntly asked for the out the door price and she called me back within minutes with that. I was satisfied but couldn’t resist asking for what I thought was impossible an even lower price and she said she’d get back to me and she sure did with a price I could not say NO to. Though Houston is about 8 hrs. from me with the money I was saving it was worth my time to make the trip! So got Sasha and my banker in touch and the next step was getting the car and everything signed. with me working 2 jobs I was starting to get a little stressed and Sasha stepped right up and arranged everything all I had to do was sign and drive away. This car buying experience was the most amazing painless process and Sasha was there every step helping anyway she could. I have now got my brand new black on black Honda accord exl  and have never felt so good with a major decision before!  I am now referring all car buyers to use Sasha Najar from Big Star Honda in Houston Texas! Honda is a name that speaks for itself but to have such a wonderful sales person sealed the deal! I want to give a special recognition to Sasha and reward her with more business for many years to come after all my boys have a 95 Honda civic and 2002 Honda Passport and though they are both running strong it’s time for them to get a new vehicle also! Thank you Sasha Najar and Big Star Honda of Houston you have gained a lifelong customer. ",5.0

My better half and I were on our way out when K J, came to change our negative experience.  He asked us what we were looking for and gave us an unbelievable price.  We didn’t walk out of there with a car because I wanted to keep looking –wanted the best price possible.  So, off I went to a few other dealerships to deal with other car salespeople.  It didn’t take long to realize that the offer KJ gave us was the best one.  When I contacted him again, the initial quoted price had increased by a couple of hundred dollars, but he upgraded me to a 2014 Honda Accord.  I’m guessing my car buying prayers worked, but I know KJ did everything in his power to honor his word (initial quote) and get me the best deal possible.  Honda Star got my business and because my former car was in the verge of breaking down, KJ put me on a loaner Honda Civic until my car arrived.  Thank you KJ, you get an “A” for being AWESOME! ",5.0

I could see no clear incentive for BSH to want the sale; they could have certainly sold it to someone else at a higher price.  The fact that BSH still wanted my business impressed me greatly.
