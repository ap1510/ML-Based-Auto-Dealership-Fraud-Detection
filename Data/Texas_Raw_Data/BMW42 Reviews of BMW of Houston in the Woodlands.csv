0,"September 29, 2019","My check engine light has been on for some time. I've had a diagnostic done and everything has come back clear, leaving only the fuel injectors as the source. it's obvious that the fuel injectors need to be replaced because every other issue has been cleared. The dealer has had my car 3 days short of a month. I've called the dealership and the only response I got was to be patient. There's a warranty for the fuel injectors which leads me to believe that they are either waiting for it to run out or they're not working on my vehicle because I'm not paying out of pocket. Whatever the issue is I'm extremely disappointed and I will never ever return to this dealership. I'm not one to go to corporate but in this instance I don't think I have much of a choice..",1.5
1,"July 09, 2019","We had Stevie as our sales associate and she was so knowledgable and sweet and was not pushy at all! I even chose the more expensive version because of a few random things that I loved and she was so supportive but also didn't push or guide me in any way towards my decisions. She answered all my questions and asked me my goals of what we needed and what I'm looking for. It was unexpected because I normally deal with sales people who try and do whats best for them and not necessarily whats great for our family. 
The finance guys were awesome and quick and we got out of there faster than we ever have when buying a car. The other sales people and employees were so sweet to my kids, as we had brought all 3 children!! We had a great experience and I am definitely now a BMW driver for life. 
Our whole family is in love with our new car!",5.0
2,"May 20, 2019","It really pisses me off that I have to give even one star!! My problem is not with the sales person, it with the managers and the finance person that handles your paper work and all the final protection add ones that can only be added at that time. Once you walk out, that’s it. You can not add any protection to your car. I understand that and thought I had already learned that previously, well I was wrong again! Ladies!!! Be aware that their are men at this place that will take advantage of you!! 

A month ago I took my car to momentum bmw mid town because I live close to there. I found my car online at the woodlands location. I took my car in because one of my tires kept getting low. I also had hit some of my rims on curbs. I do that! I know I do that! I’m a small short women. I had a friend go with me to buy the car so I wouldn’t get taken advantage of. We said I need wheel and tire protection, cause I constantly hit curbs. We laughed and made fun of it. The finance manager and I’m sorry I don’t remember his name, said ok you got it. At no time did he ever mention that it didn’t cover cosmetic to my rim. That was the entire reason I got wheel and tire, cause I know I need it!! Seriously?!? 

The day that I took my car in for the tire I also planned on getting my rims fixed, I was then notified that my protection to my tires and wheels does not cover cosmetic. Right away I called the woodlands bmw and left a message for Derek the finance manager. She said he will call me back. Over the next week I called at least 5 more times finally I got to talk to a finance guy that got Derek to call me back after a week of trying!! That is the worst customer service ever! I told Derek that right in front of the finance guy that me and my friend told him I needed the wheel and tire protection cause I run into curbs and scratch my wheels up. One would think that would be the perfect time to say “ no this type of wheel and tire doesn’t protect scratches or cosmetic” We were not hiding that the entire reason I wanted it was for the cosmetic part, and in fact very blatant about it! Derek told me that he was going to email the policy department or whoever handles the protection plans, and see if it could be added and he would get back to me. 3 weeks later after leaving more messages I still have not heard back from Derek!! I am so disappointed with this place and will never be going back. Momentum will now be getting my business. 

So LADIES, listen up!!! Be aware of this place! They are liars and will take advantage of anyone. Unless you make sure in the print of your protection that it covers cosmetic, it doesn’t matter if you tell them you need it, they will still sell you the wheel and tire protection without the cosmetic part!! They should be ashamed of the way they are doing business!! DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!!!!!!

3,"November 17, 2018","After scouring online for weeks trying to find my son a nicely equipped, reliable, stylish car with manufacturer backed certification/warranty, we finally found one here. Our online experience was great..Quick responses and plenty of information readily available. We reserved the vehicle for a couple of days to allow us to make arrangements to travel to Houston from Corpus Christi. Upon arrival, the vehicle was ready and waiting for us upfront. Our salesperson, Joseph Swinney, gave us an informed and detailed presentation of the car. We'd made the right choice. Sales manager, Ben Chiu and business manager, Eric Bowen, helped wrap up our purchase seamlessly. Thank you all for making this buying experience simple and easy. Congratulations general manager, Neil Maddox, on having a great staff who provide excellent customer service from start to finish...OUTSTANDING!",5.0
4,"May 28, 2018",I found my wife's car on line and called up BMW of the woodlands  James norrell called me the next morning and gave me details about the car. I told him that we would drive up and get a look at it. When we arrived he had the car clean and inside of dealership so that we could check it out. What I really liked better about this is that he did not push a BMW or anything else on us. He was very encouraging and easy to deal with. No pressure at all. I would definitely buy another car from James ,5.0
5,"January 10, 2018","I am so saddened by my experience at Autonation.  I purchased a BMW 328D on Friday night December 29th. I really liked the car but it wasn’t my first choice. I ended up purchasing it because it was a good option, and I knew Autonation would stand by their promise if i wasn’t completely satisfied within 5 days and 250 miles I could return it. Well, that is where things went wrong. I reached out to my salesperson on Tuesday, January 2nd when the store reopened from the holidays and let him know that without lumbar it wasn’t going to work. We texted back and forth a few times and then I drove to the store. I arrived just before noon. I had put 208 miles on the vehicle. I was well within the 5 days and less than the 250 miles. I realize their are people that purchase new vehicles or preowned vehicles and never regret or doubt their decisions. The rest of this won’t apply to that group of people. But, for those that do want to buy something different this story is for you. I was within the 5 days and well under the 250 miles. I arrived at the dealership, met my sales person and let him know that I wanted to purchase something different from the store. It was at their other BMW location 9 miles away. I even went there to look at it to make sure I wasn’t going to waste anyone’s time. I texted a picture of the sticker so they had the stock number and could begin to prepare. This is when the lie exposed itself. I was treated with disrespect, cowardice, and completely ignored by the young manager working that day. After my sales person went to let him know the details he was sent back with this quote “It was the end of the year and we already submitted your paperwork so the 5 days doesn’t apply”. How awful!!!!  I really felt that Autonation would stand behind their promise and do the right thing. I wasn’t even trying to back out of the deal; simply wanting to purchase a different car from them. I was so upset and shocked by their attitude towards me I had to leave. No one wants to argue about something that is in writing. I followed up the next day (still within the 5 days and still below 250 miles) but my sales person was out sick. I went back to the dealership on day 8. I went to the finance manager and explained what had taken place on Tuesday. He went and got the GSM who also said I shouldn’t have been treated that way and said he would get involved. But, they still would not abide by their written policy. I have kept all the text from my visit when I arrived on Tuesday. I even kept the picture of my odometer showing 208 miles when I pulled I. The lot. None of this has mattered. I spent 5.5 hours at the dealership yesterday (Jan 9th) selecting a new preowned vehicle which they were going to trade me out of mine, while costing me nearly $4,000 in lost value. I have health issues and didn’t want to argue and agreed to put more money down to help offset this loss. After selecting the car and driving it I decided to purchase it. I was going to give them the loss in a down payment (which is just disgusting when you think about it). Had the manager on Tuesday just abided by their 5 day policy I would not have had any additional loss in value. It was late and they sent me home in the car I selected and had me sign a rental agreement for the night.  He used some language like “de horse” or something like that. I agreed and finally headed home.  I arrived back at the dealership today to finish the paperwork, get some leather work touched up, and bumper damage fixed (which happened sometime between the time we returned with the car test driving it and going home.  The GSM even pulled video to see if he could find out who hit the car but said the cameras weren’t working at that point). I was shocked when the sales person returned with a sheet of paper showing my new payment at over twice the rate I was financed for on Dec 29th. It was ridiculous to think someone would pay that rate. More to come as this gets resolved. Stay tuned.",1.4
6,"October 10, 2017","This is going to be long but please read the entire review to see all the issues that I had!
So I will start from the beginning. No we did not buy the car from this dealership. Yes we bought our car used and because of this we DID purchase an extended warranty. I have work in the service department of a dealership and I know how much all dealerships hate the extended warranties. But for peace of mind since the car had already gone out of the regular warranty, I purchased it! 
With this being said, the car has been a great car, but living in Texas.....You have to have an AC that works! I was proactive and actually called the extended warranty company to make sure that all the right steps were taken so we did not waist anyone's time. So I called and scheduled an appointment for that Saturday. I pulled into this BMW of The Woodlands early on Saturday & the service writer that was there to help me. She told me that they would probably need to keep my car until the following week. I told her that that would be fine but I would defiantly need a car to drive because I would have to go to work on Monday. She told me that they were out of loaners at that time, but would call me as soon as one arrived. Saturday evening before they closed I called to see if a loaner had been returned. She told me yes and I could come & pick it up. (I had to call, she did not call me as she said she would! Like I said I have worked in the business so I understand getting busy & I realize I am not the only customer. So I let it slide!) I dropped my car off on Saturday August 5. I received a text stating my car was ready to be picked up on Thursday August 10 (could not get there until Monday) Then Friday I received another text stating that they need another day & asked me to pick it up Tuesday instead. I agreed. (Great they are really taking their time & going to get it fixed!) I picked it up on Tuesday August 15 about 6pm, it was already running so my AC was blowing cold!! I paid my deductible for the warranty! When I left I looked at the paper of what the technician wrote. Next to compressor ..... last resort (was written). Ok great they did not have to replace the compressor.
The next morning (Wednesday)I left my house at 7:30am. It took 8 minutes for my AC to blow cold air. I sent a message to the service writer to let her know. So she sent a message to the technician & then asked me to bring the car back in and assured me that I would have another loaner ready. I told her it would be later that day but I would defiantly be there. At 12:30 I was walking out of work to take my car and received a text message stating that they were out of loaners. She told me that I could ""technically"" leave my car but she did not have a loaner for me and did not have one scheduled to come back in until the following Monday! On Thursday at 9:30 in the morning I receive a message stating that there is a loaner that I can come get. So at lunch on August 17, I went and dropped my car off. On September 5, I receive a message stating that my car is ready to be picked up. (They had to change the ""last resort"" Compressor!) I went at 12:45 to pick it up. I received a message stating she was at lunch and ""And there's no balance because you already paid your deductible"". So I got my car and left! 
The following day at 8:38 in the morning, I receive a message, ""Hey can u please call me"", so I do! The conversation started out, I'm sorry but I need you to come in and pay another deductible.....I told her ABSOLUTLY NOT! She said that the extended warranty would not pay the deductible. I told her the issue was not fixed the 1st time, so that is there issue. She told me that they had to open another ticket because the first one was closed out. So this created another claim with the warranty company. (AGAIN, NOT MY PROBLEM. IT WAS NOT FIXED AND THEY SHOULD HAVE NEVER GIVEN ME THE CAR BACK!) 
Them that evening I get home and my door handle is broken! (My door handles you have to lift up to open the door! (Apparently that was not told to the people that worked there because they were pulling out!) I paid out of pocket to fix that! My husband was looking at the car 2 weeks ago because I am now loosing coolant and noticed that the reservoir is cracked and noticed one of the hoses were barely on, so he fixed it! 
This morning I am on my way to work the safety mode light comes on and my car dies in the middle of the intersection! My husband get there......ANOTHER HOSE HAD COME OFF AND IT WAS A SCREW THAT WAS LOOSE ON THE CLAMP!!!! Coincidence???? ABSOLUTLY NOT! They loosened things when they were fixing my AC and never tightened them back. I will NEVER step foot at this dealership and I would not recommend them to anyone!!! Drive to HOUSTON!!!!",1.0
7,"May 14, 2017","I recently purchased a 2007 Bentley GTC from BMW of the woodlands. Jarrett and Javier were the salesmen involved. I I've in another state and traveling was impossible due to my job demands. I had heard that you can buy a car online but I was very skeptical. Jarrett and Javier took the time and explained everything thing in detail, so I felt comfortable and took the chance. Bought the car site unseen, never touched,drove,heard how it sounded strictly by there word. When the car arrived it looked brand spanking new. I took it to my  mechanics and they looked at it  thoroughly and gave it 10 stars. Plus it was certified and still under some warranty Jarrett and Javier are the best!!!!  They are truly 10 star salesmen.",5.0
8,"March 31, 2017","Len King is the best salesperson around!  He cares about his customers and their needs, doesn't 'over-sell' and makes sure you get the car that is just right for you!  I can't thank him enough for helping us make the decision to move from another brand to BMW/",5.0
9,"December 31, 2016",It is true that BMW of the Woodlands is affiliated with AutoNation.  My sales agent Javier Castello was great. He let me test drive several pre-owned models on the lot and then worked with his counterparts in Dallas to deliver the perfect car before Christmas. They have a no haggle single price that seemed fair.  The closing process was seamless. I would recommend BMW of the Woodlands,5.0
10,"June 27, 2016","This BMW is owned by AutoNation. I had a bad experience dealing with the sales associate. In the past I had a bad experience with the Mercedes Benz North dealership, also owned by AutoNation. I can only assume that the problem is management. In the case of the BMW salesman I discovered that he priced a new vehicle in a way that I consider to be wrong perhaps even fraud. I priced the same vehicle at another BMW dealer in a different part of Houston and the price for the same car was $6,000 less. When I told the salesman this he said he had 'no idea"". I was a repeat customer and I think he should have full knowledge of the offer he gave me. ",1.4
11,"May 19, 2016","I didn't want to have to post this.  I approached the service manager with the idea that I would give her an opportunity to make things right. Since that didn't happen, here goes... Be VERY careful when taking your car in for repairs and service to this service center. There have actually been two incidents. This first was an attempt to push a $200 maintenance service that was not covered on my 6-month-old car.  It was a red flag for sure, but I just attributed it to business as usual for dealership service centers.  This most recent incident is more egregious. I took my care in for a rear passenger window replacement.  The service advisor checked in my car and ""warned"" me that sometimes an additional part is damaged when a window is broken.  Sure enough, at the end of the service review, I was told the part was bad, and they needed to charge 4 hours of labor to replace the part and the window.  In the end, the bill was to have been about $1100, plus I had already paid $200+ for the window.  It sounded so outrageous  that I picked up the car and took it to an auto glass replacement business.  It turns out the part (which I had to order and pay for up front even when the dealership was going to do the work) wasn't bad, and it took the company about 1/2 hour to replace the glass...not 4 hours. I realize had they actually replaced the part it would have taken longer, but seriously 3 1/2 hours????  When I confronted the service manager, the ""resolution"" was that she would look into it and get back to me.  It has been more than a week, and I have not heard from her or anyone else at BMW of the Woodlands.  I have 15K more miles until my ""free service"" runs out.  Not only will I never purchase another car from these folks, but I will never take my car there again. In the meantime, I requested a new service advisor. ",1.0
12,"October 01, 2015","I sold them my BMW for $30,000 but I still don't have the check after 7 days.  I was promised a check in 2 days.  They have my car and it is listed on Autonation.com so they can sell it and get paid for it but I still don't have my money.  Go to CarMax and get a check before you walk out of the store.

14,"July 21, 2015","I bought a certified BMW 750li from Lee Avera and my experience was great from start to finish. Would highly recommend him to anyone. Gets every done in a timely manner and knows what he's doing. The BMW dealership at Woodlands is truly an exceptional dealership. They really know the true meaning of customer satisfaction. I had a wonderful experience with my purchase of BMW 750 sedan. From test drive to signing the final paperwork everything went smoothly. During the entire process all my concerns and issues were addressed sincerely and to the best of my satisfaction. I would like to recognize Mr. Lee Avera. He went above and beyond excellent customer satisfaction.  Not only that, he called me a few times after the purchase to make sure everything is fine and I am happy with the vehicle.

15,"May 27, 2015","My daughter is getting her first car. And her dream car is a red BMW with tan leather. And wouldn't you know a used 2012 came on the lot 5 months before her birthday. Knowing she wanted the car Todd made me a deal that made it impossible to not purchase this one with only 25,000 miles and it also came with an extended warranty purchased by the previous owner for up to 100,000 miles!!! So then Lee steps in and makes a priceless moment happen for me. Remember her birthday is not for 5 months. So I will be hiding this car for a while. But one day we stop at the dealership to pickup license plates for her brothers car that I had just recently purchased(yes, I buy all my cars from Lee Avera and Todd at BMW). Lee knew we were coming by so he put a sold sign in the car so that when she would see it she would see that someone had already bought it. So we stop at the dealership and we go inside. She notices her dream car and just dies when she sees that it is a red with tan leather 3 series. But then her heart suddenly sinks. She notices the sold sign in the window. The scenario that Lee set up is just perfect for me! Because in 5 months on the day she gets her license I will be able to pull up that exact car that she thought was sold and make her the happiest girl in the world. And not because she is a spoiled kid. But becasue she works hard in school. She doesn't do drugs. She respects her elders and loves her family. And that is going to be a special day for me. And it wouldn't be possible if Todd and Lee had not gone through the back hoops with finance and then scheming about the car and working the deal with a single mom who just wants to make her daughter's first car not only a safe and reliable car but a memorable experience too. And I know that I can not wait for her birthday to come and to drive back up to Lee Avera and have him place that big silver bow on her car so that she can get it on that day. They know how to deliver service! Thank you for everything Lee and Todd!",5.0

17,"July 10, 2014","From the moment I sent an inquiry until I purchased my car from bmw of the woodlands the service I received was the best that anyone could ever ask for. Steps were easily presented and the consultation was genuine and personalized. Specifically the agent I worked with, John Alexander,  is the best in the business. He has extensive knowledge and experience in dealing with people, knowing how to treat people and answers every question you could think to ask. I highly recommend anyone interested in a new car to pay bmw of the woodlands a visit. You will be delightfully surprised at the level of professionalism you'll enjoy.",5.0

19,"December 07, 2013","I've owned a Mini for a couple of years that I purchased from Mini of the Woodlands. Up until a couple of weeks ago we've been satisfied with the dealership, but that did change a couple of weeks ago.  On a recent visit for Mini service, I decided to just see what kind of a trade I could get on a new BMW.  We weren't able to get a satisfactory trade-in value for the Mini, they have such a poor trade value, so we left with the Mini.  I received a notice from my identity protection service that a new credit inquiry had been added to my credit report.  When I viewed it and discovered BMW of the Woodlands had pulled an inquiry on me I was very upset.  Inquiries affect a credit score and being profiled by the dealership has really changed my opinion of BMW.  I'll be ""dumping"" the Cooper I currently own regardless of the hit I take.
If you shop at BMW of the Woodlands, beware.  They will pull your credit report without permission and profile you.  ",2.0

21,"May 22, 2013","Went to this dealership just to check out the X5.  I didn't think I was going to buy a car from them though.  However, Dennis met me outside and we drove the X5.  He also suggested to try the X3 and the X1.  I was immedately impressed with the X1 and how it fit my needs so much better than the X5.  I was sold.  However, the dealership did not have the X1 in the options I needed. 

I continued to look and had offers from other dealerships and was ready to commit on one, but then Dennis called me back and said they had what I was looking for.  They did, and the price was excellent and I bought the car unseen because of how excellent Dennis had been since our first meeting.  

From that moment on to when I purchased the vehicle to when I picked it up has been a great experience.  The experience is only topped by the driving experience of the X1 itself.  I love the car.  I am already looking forward to when I will go back and get my next BMW from Dennis.

Thanks for all your hard work and honestly.  It has been the best car buying experience ever.

25,"May 03, 2013","I stopped by at this dealership almost at closing time to buy a Ceritfied Pre-Owned. Mr. Lee Avera was assigned to me as the sales Associate.
Mr. Lee was rude enough to let us leave in 10 mins saying he call us back. Next week, he calls me and gives me couple of Lease Offers which i wasnt interested in. Browsing autonation.com (By the way, this dealership is owned by Autonation), i found multiple listings on 2013 BMW 328i. Upon asking him, he confirms the car is available with all the features mentioned in the ad. 

We buy the car (which turns out to be the loaner car) next week. Just before even leaving the dealership, we found multiple issues 
1) The A/C blower makes a terrible noise
2) No USB (quite opposite to what was in the advertisement)

Upon asking Mr. Lee about those issues, he says A/C can be fixed since it is under warranty. For the USB however, he says ""There is a Car Toys next door who can install it for you for an additional charge"" (Seriously???!!!, im at a BMW dealership, paid over 40 grand for a car and he suggests me to go at Car toys????. He should be ashamed of himself)

I ignored these things and left the dealership after spending 6 hours to get the paperwork completed. Upon driving the car and reaching home and going through the features, we find that Bluetooth hasnt been installed. (Which again was supposed to be part of the deal we made as per the advertisement.) Calling Mr. Lee he asks me to return the car and hung up on me asking me to look for a car elsewhere. 

Is this the kind of professionalism you expect from a dealership? 

Managers refused to even come to talk to me about this and instead took away the keys and refunded the money. 

Beware buyers, they will do anything to sell you a car. The service after the sale is the worst. Do yourself a favor and buy a car at Car Max who would at least be honest with you.

Not only will I not EVER purchase a vehicle from your dealership, I will be sure to tell others how I was treated and I will be sure to share the ridiculous statements made to me by someone who was not qualified to sell cheese burgers much less a premium car.

Pathetic, Unprofessional, dishonest

We have had to return three times due to them writing the contract incorrectly and changing our finance rate.It is now 6/29/12 and my trade in is still not paid off and the manager, Ronald Brannon, and no one will answer the phone we are sent to voice mail and given the run around. They have been rude bullies that blamed me the customer for their incompetence. I hope you avoid any dealings with this dealership.",1.4
35,"April 23, 2012","Having purchased several vehicles through the years, I have to admit that this car buying experience has been the best.  I will definitely recommend BMW The Woodlands to all my family and friends and suggest that they work with Nick Beard.  He was not pushy and seemed genuinely concerned that I make the best decision.  I in no way felt like I was pressured or coerced into buying something or upgrades that I did not want.  Thank you for having such personable sales people and making my purchase a pleasant one...",5.0
36,"March 14, 2012",Outstanding customer service.  Steven Malone kept me up to date on the status of my vehicle every step of the way.  Great service! I would highly recommend BMW of the Woodlands to my friends / family members.,5.0
37,"March 08, 2012","Ashley B in the loaner car department, her customer service is not that of a people person, her personality is awful. It makes the overall experience terrible. I will never visit that dealership again and I will discourage everyone that I meet from doing business with BMW The Woodlands. ",1.4
38,"February 23, 2012",Very helpful when purchasing the vehicle.  Hope that the service I had at the time of purchase will continue throught the entire life of the car.,4.8
39,"September 07, 2011",I had such a pleasant experience dealing with this dealership especially Neil. He was great with details of my car and didnt bs me around. I would recommend him to anyone looking to buy a great car for a great price. I wasnt sitting around hours trying to wheel and deal. Best overall experience I have had at a car dealership hands down!,4.8
40,"June 10, 2011",Dealt with Neil Maddox.  Challenge was he advised me of features on the car that weren't there when I drove 2.5 hours to look at the car.,4.3
41,"February 09, 2009","I bought my 335 Premium Sport back in 2007 from Ron Evans.  A very enjoyable experience.  Buying cars is not an easy thing to do but Ron made it simple.  The whole dealership was professional and fully 'up front' with the financing and did not try and muscle me into anything I did not want.  I did a lease on my car and also traded in my 2004 330.  I was a bit upside down with my trade but they gave me a fair price for it and we were all happy with the deal.  Since that time, I have had only one service and one warranty visit.  The warranty was a faulty sensor. Once I called Eric, the service manager, nothing could have been easier.  Within 8 hours I arrived, picked up my loaner, returned and got my car back washed inside and out and fixed. The service was scheduled but in addition new windshield wipers were fitted (even though not asked for) and since taking delivery my bills have been zero!!  I have been so pleased with this dealership, my wife is also now driving a Z4 roadster purchased from Ron.  I will try and get her to post a comment on this too.",5.0
