1,"April 20, 2020","I have bought my last 3 vehicles from Courtesy Nissan.  On my second car after about a year it really wasn’t meeting my needs.  Also, the loan I had really wasn’t the best in terms of APR and payment schedule. So when I had taken it in for some warranty service at a different dealer I thought it might be a good opportunity to maybe get in to a better situation. 

At this other dealer we were having some issues making everything work; not to mention I didn’t feel a good rapport with the sales team I worked with. I really wanted the car and when I asked if there was any other options I was given very bad advice.  Sometimes it doesn’t work I get that but if there is nothing they can do then they should have ended the interaction.  Not give advice that would ruin someone’s credit just so they can move a car.   

The next day I went by Courtesy and met with sales representative Dallas Iwu.  I went in asking to test drive a specific car in a specific color.  He pulled it around and let me take it for a spin.  It was exactly what I wanted and we proceeded to make the deal.  There was some back and forth but eventually we came to a price everyone was happy with.  They had no issues with my trade in needing warranty service and gave me a fair market value.

It has always been a pleasant car buying experience at Courtesy but this time was by far the best.  I am not in a car that fits my needs perfectly and a loan agreement that is much better in terms of APR and payment schedule.  I would highly recommend working with Courtesy if you are looking to buy a car.  Specifically I recommend you ask for Dallas Iwu.  He is friendly, funny and willing to find a way to make it work. I was also impressed that he didn’t get salty when I pushed back on some of the dealer included add-ons he said he would ask and did.  

Bottom line if you are in the market for a Nissan you cannot go wrong with Courtesy.

2,"April 04, 2020","Out of all the car dealerships I have been too, Courtesy Nissan made my experience by far the most simple. The entire staff is super friendly but in particular, Alan Black did an outstanding job at helping me choose a car that fits my needs and wants. I am super satisfied with my brand new Nissan Altima! I definitely recommend going to see Alan Black and the Courtesy Nissan dealership. My friends and family have also had a great experience with Alan!  He makes purchasing a vehicle fun and entertaining. 5/5 stars every time!!",5.0

They were able to find and repair a re-occurring problem that the BMW dealership was never able to diagnose correctly.

12,"February 07, 2020","We have been faithful customers for 12 years with 4 Nissan vehicles. As of today, we will not use nor recommend Courtesy Nissan. We had service done on Sunday, a bolt was left off by a technician which resulted in some damage. On Monday morning we called and waited for a manager, talked to him on Tuesday, sent him pics, wanted to come in so they could at least look at it, finally heard back today and the service manager was very unprofessional. He was accusatory, wouldn’t entertain us bringing the vehicle in, called us deceptive and on and on and on.He even lied about our timeline saying we waited over a week. Please get your services done at a different Nissan location and if possible avoid H..., the service manager. ",1.0

They promised me $0 out the door and then balance billed me for dispo fees and mileage overage which was supposed to be rolled over.  They never respond to my calls or emails for resolution. I have worked with the general manager and tried to get this resolved for a month with no luck.  Think twice before purchasing a car from this dealership.,1.6

17,"August 03, 2019","DO NOT TRUST THEIR INTERNET SALES!!!!! Internet Sales BAIT AND SWITCH: If you have had an experience with this dealership's internet sales advertising a vehicle for a very low price and then once you get there - they say it is no longer available for some reason (we never got to see the actual vehicle) - this is a BAIT AND SWITCH tactic. They have an Internet Sales Manager that will contact you (currently her name is SuRin Campbell). This manager cannot be located under the staff of their webpage.

I recently had this experience. In my experience, I made an appointment to see the vehicle as soon as the dealership opened. The Internet Sales Manager confirmed again this morning and told me to ask for her or a salesperson named KC. We drive 40 minutes in the rain to the dealership and they say SuRin is not in. The salesman proceeds to try to get me to finance a vehicle. I was very specific with him and the Internet Sales Manager that I had recently relocated and I was in the process of looking for a job. My intentions were to buy a cash car until I was ready to finance. It would be stupid for me finance a car without a job at an incredibly high interest rate and it would be stupid for them to finance me? How would I make these payments???? 

I had every intention of sticking to my plan and asked to see the vehicle that I was scheduled to test drive. My sister-in-law went on to inform them she has purchased many vehicles via the internet and whenever she scheduled an appointment to see a vehicle, it was up front and ready for her to test drive. The salesman then admits we were the Nine hundreth and Ninety Ninth person to contact him about this vehicle and it should have never posted. They can't sell it because it can't pass inspection. Although, as of yesterday evening, the Internet Sales Manager said it was in excellent condition nothing wrong with it and the ad says ""You can have confidence in our Pre-Owned selection because of the inspection process by factory trained technicians.""  

I asked the salesperson when did he discover the vehicle could not pass inspection and what is wrong with it. He said he just found out and he couldn't disclose what was wrong with it. Hmmmm...so what did he tell the other Nine Hundred and Ninety Eight people who inquired about the vehicle? Also, did they all call this morning between the time he called me at 8:43 am (before he knew something was wrong with the car) and the time I arrived at 9:30 am (when he just found out)? Mind you, I pulled the CarFax. The car passed the state inspection May 2019.

I asked to speak to a manager, they sent out a guy named ""Ron"" who claims to be the manager with a bunch of tattoos and what appears to be sideburns drawn on with a Sharpie and colored in. His face had been rained on and his beard was running down his face. He trudges over to us and lays back in his seat like we are all just hanging out. 

My sister-in-law informed him that this was clearly a Bait and Switch tactic and she was going to report the dealership. He didn't apologize for the inconvenience, but says I shouldn't have a problem with him or the in-store sales person - my issue should be with the Internet Sales Manager (go figure - they should all represent Courtesy Nissan right???). Her response was - if he's the manager, our problem is with him because he would be the one responsible for the sales tactics of his employees. The buck should stop with him.

This so called manager basically told her to go ahead and report them and we will do just that. I have saved the pdf of the ad, the VIN Report, CarFax and all of the text communication regarding the vehicle. I am reporting them to Nissan Consumer Affairs, BBB, the Consumer Protection Agency and the Federal Trade Commission. I suggest you do the same for this dealership and any other dealership who participates in Bait and Switch.",1.0
18,"July 15, 2019","First time visit to Nissan Courtesy for a 90k service with a 2015 Nissan Xterra and I can not recommend this location. There are three reasons:

1. They are greedy. During the online appointment via the website they quoted the 90k service with $117.95. At the appointment they try to sell you their ""recommended"" 90k service for $399.95. This is more then 3x times the estimated amount during the online appointment.

2. They are incapable. On top of the service I ordered the replacement of a broken fog light which is mounted in the fender. This is very hard to get to, therefore I already expected a higher price. The light itself went for $148 and for labor they charged $147. But then they came back and said the connector is damaged and would need to be replaced. Unfortunately the connector can not be bought standalone by Nissan. I had the choice of a complete new wire harness or a 3rd party connector that they can splice in for an addition $260!!!! Give me a break. I am an electrical engineer and I know that connecting two wires does not cost that amount of money. The fog light is a non safety related item and hack fix would have done the job. Fact is I payed close to $300 for a new fog light that still does not work because the mechanics do not know how to connect two wires.

3. They are very slow. At the beginning they quoted 90min to 2h for the service and repair. I took four hours before I got the car back. And there is a reason for it. From the waiting area they have nice big windows so you can watch the mechanics. Actually there were nearly no mechanics. Every bay was filled with a car but there were barely people working on it.

The only reason I still gave two stars is because they were capable to do the oil change, tire rotation and a complementary car wash. ",1.8
19,"July 02, 2019","I got a. Nissan rouge on lease and they kept me dark and added a 400 dollar without my notice and not mentioning about this in my contract 

When I read the contract in detail and escalated to the manager he says it was an issue with the training but he will not waive the fees that was not told to me 

This is very unfair way of conducting business to accept the mistake but making the customer pay for their mistake ",1.0
20,"June 25, 2019","My experience with Courtesy Nissan was the WORST customer service I have ever experienced. Marvin was rude, condescending, and did absolutely nothing to help make a car issue easier on me. Nothing about Courtesy Nissan lives up to their name. 

Before coming in, I scheduled an appointment online, then called to confirm my vehicle could be same-day serviced. As well, my car is still under warranty. When I arrived, I was told that it would be 1-2 business days before my vehicle could even been diagnosed. I was also told that the “courtesy” shuttle could only take me 10 miles. This is the closest dealership to my house, and is 12 miles away, so I was not able to use the shuttle. I was also told that “the business no longer utilizes courtesy loaner vehicles” and that my option was a $35/day rental on my own dime. I was not offered the option to put my name in the line and come back; I was told I had to leave my car. When I asked to speak with a manager, it took a very long time. Finally, Marvin (the lead manager, according to their website) came out. Instead of apologizing for the situation and help me problem solve, he kept telling me that “well that’s not how my industry works” when I would ask a question. Further, he acted as though I was incompetent and uneducated.

When I finally told him that I would take my car elsewhere, he began trying to get me to stay with his salesman techniques of “no one else will have availability either” and was holding my door so I couldn’t leave. I will absolutely NEVER take my car back here again, or purchase a vehicle from this dealership. 

Shortly after, I called a different dealership that was not far (Metro Nissan). They were able to get my car in immediately, had a courtesy vehicle ready for me to use, and we’re kind and considerate as they helped me trouble shoot the issue my car was having and the best course of action moving forward. So clearly, the practice at Courtesy Nissan is a business practice, not an industry practice. ",1.0
21,"April 18, 2019","I made an appointment to see/drive a used car they had advertised both on their website and on truecar.com. I did my research on the vehicle prior to my appointment. The carfax showed that the car had already passed inspection and was ""offered for sale' 6 days prior to my appointment. When I showed up, the person with whom I scheduled the appointment took my information and then after going to the back, came back and told me I needed to meet with the Used Car Sales Mgr. It was at this time the manager informed me the car didn't pass inspection and could not be sold. He offered to show me a car that cost more than twice than the car I was trying to buy. I explained to him that I came to buy a car outright not to finance one and the car that I had come to see was within my budget. He then said they might sell it at the auction but if they opted to make the necessary repairs, they would end up selling the car for more. I asked him what the repairs were and he wouldn't tell me. He offered me no details whatsoever. The CarFax clearly shows that the vehicle not only passed inspection but is cleared for sale. It is an unethical business practice to list something on your website and then say it's not available for sale. ",1.0
22,"April 15, 2019","I initially had an awful experience but the GM reached out to me and got my issues sorted for me. I wish I could say there were no issues, but they made a good faith effort to correct them so I will give them another chance.",4.4

So I took it in to Courtesy Nissan of Richardson to have it looked at and I was set up with Ms. Kaelyn Smith. She was very friendly, patient, and super helpful throughout the entire process. Kaelyn made sure everything was done in a timely manner, even when it came to parts that needed to be ordered for my car, I took my car in on Thursday and by Saturday morning the parts that I needed were in and placed on my car. I really appreciate her and all she did for me her excellent customer service is the reason I will keep coming back. Thank you Courtesy Nissan and a big Thank You to Ms. Kaelyn Smith. ",5.0

26,"March 24, 2019","Terrible experience.  Courtesy Nissan appears to sell its customers’ information to spammers, who harass you with incoherent, unprofessional text messages trying to get you to trade in your vehicle.  We started receiving these text messages mere moments after dropping our vehicle off, yet nobody at Courtesy Nissan will take responsibility for these messages.

Our service advisor, Deborah, could not provide an adequate explanation for the work that needed to be performed.  She continued to repeat the same thing over and over, instead of actually explaining the reason for the work and labor operations.  After contacting others in the repair industry, I was informed that some of these additional operations and charges were completely unnecessary.  This is compounded by their absurd $140/hr labor rate.

Save yourself a headache and take your car elsewhere.",1.5

28,"November 16, 2018","I came in for a routine maintenance check up for my Nissan Versa. If I had gone through with all of the recommended services I would have been out about 5,000. 

I got my oil changed, and my serpentine belt replaced for 700$ and I came back two weeks later because my check engine light went on. 

They told me my throttle body system needed to be reprogrammed and that my car won't be able to start over time. They tried to charge my 2000$ for that. I went to a local third party dealer. They confirmed there was nothing wrong the throttle body system. I saved 2000$ because of them.

They act all nice and courteous but even in the service dept. they are trying make you go broke. This dealership is terrible, please do not go here.

29,"September 28, 2018","Nothing courteous about Courtesy Nissan! I am usually not someone that takes time out of my day to share negativity I experience but it only seems fitting here.

I needed a 2013 Altima transmission reprogrammed, two transmissions later at only 107,000 miles. I called to get pricing and they told me it would be $140, so I confirmed that would be the total cost, which they assured me it was. Upon arriving at the dealership I told them my issue, confirmed the cost, and was asked to wait about an hour and half but that a shuttle would arrive in 15 minutes to get me back to work if I needed it. Nearly 2 hours later there was no shuttle and the car still was not done or even started on! Nearly 4.5 hours later the car was ready. I then went to check out and pay my $140, as this is what I was told would be the total. Come to find they charged me $22.40 for miscellaneous fees. I asked about the fees and they told me THE STATE REQUIRES THEM TO CHARGE THIS FEE. I had never heard of anything like this and so I questioned it and they proceeded to tell me that it isn't a required fee but that THE STATE ALLOWS THEM TO CHARGE THE MAXIMUM of that fee and that it was for shop supplies, which plugging a device into my car requires zero shop supplies whatsoever. They then told me that they are not sure what the supplies were, perhaps they were towels to wash their hands? I am truly appalled that they are charging fees that they cannot even identify.  I then told them I was informed the total would be $140 and that I believe they should only charge that, if it were tax or some justifiable fee, I could understand (which they did charge tax on). They then told me they would not remove the fee. I told them that they had not been transparent with their fees or with the time I would be required to wait and that I really did not appreciate that. They proceeded to tell me that I am ""JUST ONE PERSON"" and ""ONE BAD REVIEW WOULD NOT HURT THEM"".

I hope that management sees this and addresses the gross lack of transparency and customer service. I may be just one person but I will be sure to spread the word to my friends, family, and online so that people know what they are getting into at Courtesy Nissan.",1.0
30,"August 26, 2018","Long story went to Courtesy Nissan to Trade in my 2017 Nissan Titan XD for a 2018 Titan Platinum Reserve. The reason for coming was to find avenues to get my truck out of my moms name. I told them straight up that I only want to make a deal if the truck is in my name only. They agreed. They came to me and said we have a deal. I sign my papers and all my mom have to do is sign her docs of Power of Attorney to release the vehicle and it will be out of her name. I drove of the lot a happy customer on Friday July 27. That following Monday July 30 i received several phone calls stating bring the truck back in. I gets off work to see what’s going on and they told me they couldn’t do a deal without my mom co signing again. I said no that’s not going to work but I will try and convince my mom to sign. Meanwhile I told them to take the truck, give mines back so I wouldn’t run no more miles on the platinum reserve. They said no you hold on to it until your mom signs the papers which I knew she wouldn’t well guess what my mom didn’t agree to the finance numbers so she didn’t sign them. Well while all that was going on I still had the truck and running miles on it. The whole process took over a week because my mom lives out of town so it has to come back in the mail. Well when I turned the truck in it had over 900 miles on it by driving back and forth to work and going out of town. Well they were pissed off at me for bringing a brand new truck back with a bunch of miles. Well I told them to take it they didn’t listen to me so hey their finance managers and sales manager drop the ball on that then they try to blame it on me. Then they told me you will never be able to get out of your truck ever again. Guess what I was able to and got it finance with my name only. Too bad I had to go elsewhere to do great business and great customer service. When I say I will never do business with Courtesy Nissan again. Never. Even though I have a Nissan Pathfinder im taking it to another Nissan where I can get better customer service. Oh I forgot to tell u this one. Hey they appraised my Titan XD for $25,500. I owed $41,000 thousand which left me with $14,500 upside down well the platinum reserve had $7500 rebates on them so it knocked it down in half. Then I seen pictures online that they were going to sell my truck for $33,000. Now how in the world my truck is worth $25,500 and u selling my truck for $33,000.

I show up 15 minutes early- only to be told that no one would be able to fix my mirror until mid Monday. 

Why did the gentleman make a reservation then for 3 pm after I explained to him how critical it was that I get this fixed?

When I get there they immediately treat me like an inconvenience and tell me I can not leave my car with them and push a rental car agreement with a no pets clause, which I say will not work since I have a dog who needs monthly vet visits. An hour later they offer no solution and say I will have to deal with nissan directly. Terrible customer service and I will never go there again for any reason.",1.0

54,"September 07, 2017","It is long story. 1. They sold a hail damaged car after fixing them, but not 100%, there are still very small hail damages on the roof. 2. They told me 90 days paid vacation but they did not give it when they sold the car. I did not know till Nissan Financial called me after 11 days later of payment due date.
3. When I dropped off my car, they drove my car as a personal car. That is why miles kept going up whenever I checked the mileage and to make  matters worse, they made scratches and dents on my car when they took out my car for their weekend picnic. They never apologize it. Although I complained it to Nissan Company, they just stopped driving my car only for a while but they used my car again as their personal car. Here are some trash list in this dealer, Jeff, Rene Galuan, Sal De La Hoya, Ric Moreno.
When I found a small dent on the window trim metal, I asked Jeff ""This car had hail damage?"" He said, ""No, it is just dent, we will fix it."" So, next day when I dropped off my car to fix the small dent, he brought a paper work, and he told me that he needed to have my signature for a rent a car, so I just signed in it, but it was paper to cheat me.  I will have meeting with a consumer lawyer to sue them this weekend. I also report to BBB soon. I will update this one later with detail story to let customers know how much they are rude, idiots ,and cheaters. They only study how to cheat customers and xxxx up customers. Even General sales manager does not know my car has hit side mirror. When I asked how to use the hit side mirror, he just said clearly, ""I don't know"" wow~~~~ so this man proud of it?

68,"July 28, 2017","My first solo car-buying experience was truly awesome. I'd done my research, read reviews, narrowed down the options, and checked inventory ahead of time. That's why I chose to visit Courtesy first.  I walked in and was pleasantly surprised when I wasn't bombarded by several salespeople as I'd experienced at other dealerships years ago with my dad, so I just started checking out the car I was interested in...a 2017 Maxima. Joe Crawford greeted me, and I advised him that my goal for the day was to simply learn everything about the car and try it out...no pressure. I even told him I had no intentions of making a decision that day since I'd need to consider all options and speak to my dad. He was absolutely fine with that. We began our journey, and Andrew Hogan jumped in to help us out periodically since Joe is new. They were both super nice, informative, helpful, and patient, which was much appreciated since I had tons of questions. I was considering leasing but had no experience with it, just info. Fernando jumped in to help me understand the inner workings and features of the car, making great analogies to help a non-car enthusiast understand in more relatable terms. They are a great team. When I needed to leave to run errands and check out another brand option, they suggested I take a loaner of the car I was interested in for an extended test drive. Uh...awesome...and a set up. Lol. They knew I'd love it. A couple signatures and I was out. The other car with a true ""luxury"" brand was nice, but it just couldn't compare to the Maxima. When I returned, we hashed out the details with the help of Sal, who was also wonderful and willing to answer a few questions my dad had over the phone. They were able to get me everything I wanted for a price I was totally comfortable with. They ordered the color I wanted and are putting a sunroof in my S model since I really don't care for all the techy additions to the SL. Love it! Since it won't be here and finished with the install til sometime next week, they had me go ahead and keep the loaner so I'd get a feel for my new car. Eek!!! Awesomeness all day long. The paperwork process took a little while, but once Donna got me in there for all the signatures, it was all a breeze. And to think, I was adamant about not walking out with a car. If you're looking for a great car, but more importantly a great company with easygoing people who aren't super pushy to do business with, save yourself some time and confusion by heading over to Courtesy Nissan. Tell them Jasmine Lawrence sent you. You won't regret it. ;-)",5.0

The very identical review has been posted on their Facebook and Google reviews last week, there's also a Yelp review but it got snubbed to a non-reliable list. I was out of town to finish the job, letting everybody know how awful this place is. Now that I have time, I'm gonna finish the job.

I brought in my Nissan Sentra in for an oil change, brake check and among other things at around 7:30 AM. After an hour, the service advisor came in to informed there are other things needed to be taken care of. Since he had info on how much the work would cost me, so instead he made me waited for another hour. After he came back giving us the price quote, we agreed to it and let him take my car back in. About 15-20 minutes later while we waiting for a ride home, the advisor came back out apologizing the initial diagnosis was incorrect, we actually only need some works done with the fuel injector. We agreed to work and the price, then be on our way. 

At around 11 AM, he called saying the work is done. I arrived there and PAID THE BILL at 11:50 AM, and was prompted by the cashier the car is in the wash and should be out in any minutes. She told us to wait in the lobby, when the car is out she'll call us. Shockingly, 2 hours later, I was still sitting in the lobby while my car was no where to be found. She began calling all workers to look for it. The first one that spoke through the walkie talkie insisted he already BROUGHT THE CAR TO THE FRONT, and he already HANDED THE KEY TO HER. The second worker walked around the front and couldn't find any Silver Sentra parked in the front. Finally, she got one of the managers to look for it. As I looked through the windows, I saw him drove my car from the back lot straight to the front. After he pulled it in, he handed the key and ran to the back with NO APOLOGIES WHATSOEVER, I was standing there at the cashier counter the entire time.

Decided to give them a chance to explain/rectify it, but that went no where. The only email response I got from the manager himself was only 2 sentences long. I don't see any sincerity in that.

I have no plan accepting any reconciliation with this dealership service department any longer, we're through. There are plenty other auto shop around town would be more than glad having my business and money in the future.",1.2

When I came back a few hours later, they had done an interior clean and quick inspection. I received a few recommendations for approaching service issues ranked by current state of the vehicle with their cost estimate to handle it, and was encouraged to look around for better deals.

126,"August 08, 2014","My husband and I decided to get a third key to our Nissan Leaf for our 17 year old daughter.  We purchased the key and took it in to be programmed which costs around $150ish.  I told them we wanted an additional key, not a replacement key.  Instead of programming the new key to match the old key, they reprogrammed both keys, therefore, my husband's key that I didn't bring is now rendered useless.  I started with 2 working keys and ended with 2 working keys instead of the 3 that I needed, and lost 3 hours of my life that I'll never get back.  If they had asked me if I had all the keys with me, I would have said no and gone to my husbands office nearby and returned with the 3rd key.  The scheduler could also have told me to bring all keys..  When I complained, they offered to redo it with a loan car that was never followed thru with or provided, yet I had to return there for the free redo.  

A few months later, I came back for the car's 3 year checkup and told the service technician that I was experiencing battery loss.  They didn't seem to check the battery, nor provide me with the EV battery usage report required by Nissan.  I made an appointment with another dealer to get the battery rechecked.  They have an even worse rating than Courtesy.

128,"May 28, 2014","6 months ago, I was looking for car. finally I purchased car from Courtesy Nissan dealer at Richardson, TX. At that time sales man promised that they will provide 3 year free maintenance( oil change and tire rotation) and unlimited car wash. Last week I went to dealer for my fist maintenance and surprised of Courtesy Nissan director of sales(Brandon Minatra) was asking written document that Sales man's promised.

Unfortunately, sales man who sold me the car no longer works at this dealer. when I asked sales director to talk to his manager, he is the highest position in dealership and he does not report to anybody. I asked him for his visiting card and he said that he does not have one. He took blank card and wrote his name and gave it me. as per his words he mentioned that in state of Texas everything has to be done in writing.
Now how I am suppose to believe such a person who claims to be sales director of car dealership. see below sales man has visiting card but not sales director.
 My whole point of frustration is that I was not deliver what I was promised. if I am willing spend 21k on car I surely can afford paying for my service. its sales trick to sell a car with false promises. just a friendly reminder and warning for anyone who is thinking to buy a car from Courtesy Nissan",1.0

I sent an email to the internet email address at Courtesy Nissan on Thursday afternoon, 2/13/2014.   David Mullen, the internet sales manager at Courtesy Nissan, responded promptly by email and also phoned me.   I had him phone my wife, because I was at work, which he did promptly.

131,"November 02, 2013","On October 21, 2013, I brought my 2007 Infiniti M35 in for an oil change.  Although I live in uptown Dallas, I drove my car several miles to Courtesy Nissan because I believe in having my vehicle serviced by an Nissan dealership rather than an independent auto shop.  When I began driving, years ago, I chose Nissan/Infiniti as my preferred car manufacturer and I have remained loyal to that particular brand to this day, disregarding the inconvenience and expense of travelling twenty or thirty miles to a familiar Nissan dealership.  Following the oil change on the 21st, I noticed a lag in acceleration on my way home.  Not one to worry needlessly, I parked the vehicle in my garage until I left for work the next morning.  When I returned home from work, I noticed a large amount of fluid on the garage floor.  Inspecting the undercarriage, I discovered the vehicle was hemorrhaging oil.  

I knew it was too late to call the service department immediately, so I spent a rather sleepless night waiting for the dealership to open.  When I called at 8:00 am on 10/23/2013, I explained to the service department that every drop of the oil in my engine had been completely drained.  I am more than familiar with the mechanics of a car’s engine, and I had already discovered the oil leak was due to an improperly secured oil drain plug.  (I have pictures of the condition in which my car was returned to me.) The service representative I spoke with, Carey Lindsey, suggested I drive the vehicle to the dealership.  I refused, pointing out that the damage done by his service department was potentially irreparable and I needed the car towed.  

A tow was issued rather quickly and I would say the driver left my residence around 9:30 that same morning.  Around 11, Carey left a voicemail for me stating that he pulled it in and discovered “there was oil on the dipstick.”  Oil was pretty much on everything, it leaked everywhere.  But he failed to clarify if the dipstick was hitting oil inside the engine.  It was not.  I checked that first, anyone would.  Then, stuttering through the rest of his message, he said it could “possibly be a gasket or the oil filter,” when he and I both know it was nothing more than negligent replacement of the drain plug.  Although he promised to give me an update, I took no comfort in his assessment or his unfounded and untested prediction that no damage had been done to the engine.  Several hours later, with no update from Carey or Nissan at all, my anxiety began to rise and I finally called the service department.  Carey nonchalantly stated that my car was ready, as though I should have known the entire time that it could be picked up whenever I felt inclined.  He made no attempt to explain or apologize for having failed to follow through with his promise to update me as soon as he had reached an absolution for the issue, and, underscoring his lack of professionalism,  he never once expressed concern for how I might get to the dealership.  Shockingly, after I got to the dealership, no one offered a breakdown of the services that were done to ensure the vehicle’s engine was performing at an optimal level.  To his credit, Carey apologized for the inconvenience, stating that nothing was wrong with the vehicle, but he failed to document exactly how he concluded the vehicle was in excellent working condition.  Knowing that I keep my car immaculate inside and out, Carey made sure to point out that the undercarriage and engine were thoroughly cleaned.  The cleaning was also listed on the invoice given to me at the time of pickup.  

 

When I returned home, I noticed oil still dripping from the engine.  I took it to another shop and after putting it on the lift, I was disgusted to see that the undercarriage was saturated with oil.  I was very disappointed to see that the engine splash cover was cut to expose the oil pan.  Instead of taking the time and care to remove the cover properly, the service department took it upon themselves to damage my car in order to fix the sloppy and unacceptable error they made in the first place.  The only response I have received a text message from Carey when I requested to speak with a manager only stating the following: 

“Mr. Patel I was called into the office today about the oil issue.  I apologize that we did not clean under carriage very well.  If you could bring it back I will get it cleaned up for you.  And by the way I offered to give you supplies up clean your garage are reimburse you but you stated in your letter that we never offered pay you sorry for the franker.  I accidently sent it with out correcting my grammer,”  First, of all I have never sent you or dealership a letter.  Second, I could careless about the oil in my garage.  Third, I would not bring my car to your dealership due to your lack of concern of personal property and not taking responsibility of your action.  Let me come to your dealership empty your personal car’s oil drive it 30 miles and give it back to you and let’s see how you feel.  Mind you I paid for this service is not settling with me at all.  

After calling back to have the situation rectified, I was told a supervisor by the name of Daniel McClure would call me back that same day.  Four days later, I have heard nothing from McClure or anyone with Courtesy Nissan.  This facility does not deserve to bear the Nissan brand.   After the fact, I have looked up reviews on Goggle, Yahoo, Dealer Rater and other review site seems to be an ongoing issue at this location and with this letter I hope others will understand my frustration and avoid using them for anything.  I have everything documented as will as pictures showing the oil all over the engine knowing just a matter of time before I am left with a damaged engine.

133,"August 11, 2013","Two years ago I paid extra for life time brake pads at Courtesy Nissan service department. My brake pads were low so I took the Pathfinder back to Courtesy for new pads. After first being told it would be handled under warranty, I was then told it would cost a fortune and that I needed pads, rotors, etc. I was also told I didn't have life time pads, I had after market pads.
 I produced the ticket from two years before showing I had paid extra for life time pads and if I didn't actually have life time pads it was Courtesy's fault. After complaining to the General Manager he told the acting service manager to replace the pads. Of course they charged Labor. Life time pads guarantee doesn't cover Labor. I asked for the rotors to be turned (cut down smooth) and the Acting Service Manager refused explaining that they don't like to turn the rotors because of the mileage on my car. So I got new pads on rotors that were not turned.
 I had to take the car to another repair shop the next day to get the rotors turned. I had a horrible experience with these guys. They called me the next day wanting to sell me a new car.

It is as if like they don't care.  They offer to pay me for it but do not pay the full amount promised.  I call their service manager again and leave a message.  No response.

138,"August 08, 2012","I went to Courtesy Nissan on Saturday, August 4th. Like most others, I would not go back to Courtesy Nissan under any circumstances. I had an Employee purchase plan which guaranteed that I could buy a car at 3% ubder invoice, so the only points of negotiation was what they would allow for my 1996 Mercedes SL320 trade-in and the price of the dealer add-ons. (Even though it had 150,000 miles on it, it was kept in immaculate shape.) Even though those points were the only things to settle, it still took over 4 hours to complete the sale. 
I first went to CarMax and got their bid to buy my car ($4000). I knew the Car Max low-xxxxx their buy offer but this was a starting point. The salesman I dealt with (Alex) was a young kid who had no clue how to sell a car if anything varied from the Nissan ""system"". I have no complaint about Alex. The problem was with Bryan, the interminable waits between Salesman, manager, appraiser, finance and delivery.
Alex and I went through the standard steps before I selected the car I wanted; a 2012 Sentrea base.
Now comes the insulting part. After driving several cars, Alex and I returned to see what the trade-in offer was. 45 minutes of test driving and they had not even looked at my car. Bryan said they'd get it done right away. Right away took about 30 minutes. Finally, Bryan returned and had the gall to say ""Your car is very old and has a lot of miles on it. We can offer you $1250 trade-in allowance. Obviously, he thought I had 'just fallen off of the turnip truck:"". after I blew up and showed him the CarMax bid, he agreed to allow $4000.
This saga goes on and on. At each step in the process there was a 30 to 45 minute wait. Granted, it was a Saturday and they were very busy, but I don't care about their other customers, I only care about getting finished and not wasting my time.

At this point, he didn't even introduce himself or shakehands. I told him I was looking for a new 2011 Rouge, and he proceeded to barriage me with questions, like how much do you want to pay a month, what features do you want, etc. I declined to answer, just stating I want to see what you have first. He then said let's go outside and take a look. Only after we were walking to the door, did he decided I was worth meeting and then he introduced himself. His name was Jay (I couldn't pronounce his last name, he was an Indian fellow). We looked at some Rouge's and I told him what I wanted, so, he said he would get a key to one that fit my description, however, we had to go to another parking lot a few miles down the street to look at it. So, I obliged and off we went to see the car. Well, 45 minutes later and 3 parking lots later, he still couldn't find the car. I told him to take me back to the dealership. When we got back, he said he didn't know what had happened the car was suppose to be there. Well, low and behold, when he talked to his manager, it was pointed out that the car was right outside all along, we even walked right by it. I was still patient, thinking it was not his fault. So, we looked at the car, and took it for a quick spin, I liked it and he said let write up some numbers. I told him I want know what the finance rates were and he said he didn't know. I also told him the price was too high, at which point he called his sales manager. The manager came over and slapped down a piece of paper and said this is the best deal I can do, which was pretty good deal, but the way he came across was very rude. So, I asked him I need to know the finace rates based on my excellent credit, again I was told I needed to talk with the finance guy. So, I filled out some more paperwork and I waited for 30 mins for this guy. Finally, when I got in there, he punched up some numbers and gave a really high rate quote. I told him, no way. He said he would have to talk to the sales manager. They both came back in the office and gave me another rate quote, but I told him it was still not good enough and why did he have to talk to the sales manager about the rates when he said in the first place he didn't know. It was past 10pm now and I had lost my patience. The sales guy walked out, leaving the finance guy and myself looking at eachother. He proceeded to just leave me in the office as he took off as well. The sales guy was no where to be found, so I just walked out. They didn't even return my car keys, so I had to track down the sales guy outside and retrieve my keys, he then asked me what happened, I told him straight up that this dealership is crap, and the sales manager is a jerk. I've wasted my entire evening and got nothing accomplished. To wrap up this story, I drove 20 miles further to Orr Nissan in Cornith and got a great deal and was treated like customer should be treated. I bought a Rouge fully loaded for what I was going to pay at Richardson Nissan, go figure. Moral of the story, don't mess around with jerks like the ones at Richardson Nissan.

146,"December 28, 2010","I wanted to first off talk about what bought me to the dealership.  They had advertised Nissan Altima's at 15,795 on cars.com I sent a email to them and someone called me Vicki Beard.  I asked if they still had the Altima's advertised, she said yes we have over 40 at that price.  I was shocked but said ok I will come out sometimes this week.  I visited them on a Saturday and 1st thing was they didn't have the Altimas out there at the price listed she said they were all sold.  I said that's what I asked you, she said that they had others so I was discouraged from that point on.  I could have stayed 30 miles closers to my house at Clay Cooley's for those prices.  But I tried looking around.  I looked at the Altima new, used and Xterra.  When looking on the used car lot side my son and I saw a white Nissan Maxima which we thought was nice.  I asked about it and we then test drove it.  Now I did like it, but I told her that I hadn't done my research on Maxima's since I had only been looking at the Altima's and Rogue and Xterra's.  So we haggle back in forth on my trade which was a 2006 Dodge Ram 1500 SLT Big Horn edition.  We came to some type of an agreement and I told her to draw me up an Buyers Order for my Credit Union, she said no we can let you go home in the car with the Credit Union financing and I said you sure because I really just want a buyers order because I haven't done much research on this car to see if I am getting the best possible price.  She insisted in I was ready to go and so were my boys.  I had been there from 12 noon to 6 pm that night. So I drove home in the car left my truck without removing any of my personal items from it yet, therefore the sale wasn't final so I thought.  I went home immediately and went to cars.com again and type in the price I wanted to go under and I found a vehicle about 2 blocks down from them with 10,000 miles less and 2000 dollars less then there's was.  I emailed her on Monday and told her that I thanked her for her Patience Vicki Beard but decided to go with a car with less miles and better prices and it immediately turned sour.  She went ahead and tried belittling me which didn't work and then said when would I have there car back.  I replied when I get off of work like originally plan had I been buying the car.  I work in Fort Worth so I left there around 4:15 and got to the dealership around 5:45.  I saw Vicki with a customer so I got her attention with a wave and she waved back and I stood up to just wait on her.  After a while she came over and asked for there keys and I gave it to her and she went back to sit down with her customer.  Then I told her I have my things in the car that I have to take from your car to put in mines.  She said it's unlocked.  So because it was Christmas and at my job it was gift exchange day I had lots of presents to walk with and bring inside the dealership with.  I stood at the front desk from a while then I asked her where is my car again because I had asked her early to no avail.  She then walked away without acknowleding that she heard me and came back with the key and my metal license plates in her hand.  I said what am I supposed to do with this, whose going to go get my car, she said you can go get it.  I said where is it located, she said in the back through the gate.  And I then said oh now I can go behind the gate and she said yes.  So I said well who will be putting my license plate back on and she said you didn't bring a screw driver with you?  I said huh I've never seen anything like this in my life, I've bought many cars and never have they taken the plates off and given them to me in my hand.  I was furious at this point so I asked the front desk lady may I speak to the Manager and she said that they're both busy.  One was Mr. Aguilar and Lisa Carr.  Lisa who so graciously came out on the day of looking at cars was a perfect meet and greet Manager but that night couldn't come out to get me my car or ask what they could do to keep me in that car.  Aguilar came out to ask if anyone was helping me and I told him that I had b

So I got more and more frustrated being in the dealership for now over 45 minutes staying up without anyone's help.  And I saw Vicki Beard walk back in forth without any stare in my direction.  I then called my son-in-law who is a Dallas Police and ask can I call the police on these people for not returning my car and he said yes.  I then spoke loudly and said I'm going to call the police if I don't get my car.

I explained to Howard Griffin my situation and initially he said we were just too far apart and I was ready to go. Then they told me just wait a few minutes. It was more than a few minutes but I did not mind because they kept me updated on what they were trying to do. I don't know how many people helped out on my purchased but when it was all over I left with a car I could afford and did not feel like I just got taken advantage of by the salesman. Now to help my case I had done some homework before I went to the dealership and had my own financing. So I knew going in not to expect must help from them, because of the four previous Nissan dealers who tried to put me into something I could not afford or to do some crazy financing that would have surely hurt me in the long run. It is good to know there are still car dealerships left who actually listens to the customer. I will recommend Courtesy Nissan to my friends and family in the future.

148,"June 11, 2010","If I could give less than 1 star I would.  I purchased my vehicle from Courtesy late December. Within a couple weeks I noticed the dealer installed tinting on the passenger side window was starting to peel and roll up in the corner. I took it back to see what they could do to fix/replace it.  They said they could redo the window without an issue. Fantastic! Or so I thought. After replacing the tint, I noticed that there were bubbles in the window and asked about it. The response I got was “the cold weather is causing the tint to set slower than usual, in the heat that stuff goes away much quicker. Give it some time and it’ll go away.”  I gave it time (2 months) and the bubbles remained.  I told them I’d bring it back during the summer when its warmer. That would eliminate any excuses in my opinion.
Summer has hit and I brought it in to get fixed. Prior to bringing it in, I felt the need to check all the other windows to see if they needed repair. Low and behold, all but the driver side window had bubbles.  I mention this to the dealer (Charles Wilson) and he says they can go ahead and redo all the windows. We speak to the service manager and get things set up. I bring my car in a few days later to get it repaired and when I come back to pick it up, I noticed that they only fixed one window- the driver side window- the one that didn’t need to be fixed.  All the other windows still have bubbles. Confused? So am I. 
I speak to one of the managers/dealers in Courtesy and all I get is “Well, you can bring it in again and we’ll fix it.” How many times do I have to bring in a car to get one thing fixed? It makes me wonder what happens with more complicated repairs, do customers have to bring in their cars 15 times to get a transmission replaced? I refuse to bring it back only to be subjected to additional disappointment and wasted time. I will eat the costs of the tinting I paid for when I bought the car and go take it somewhere reputable so I can get it done right.
In addition, upon driving home highly disappointed, I hear a slight rattle coming out of the driver side door that was not there when I dropped the car off.  Like all squeaks and rattles, it will probably only get worse as time progresses.
Suffice it to say, I am highly disappointed in Courtesy Nissan of Richardson and will never be serviced there again.

149,"April 19, 2010","I found a Nissan Pathfinder listed on the Courtesy Nissan website and sent an inquiry with my price limit.  Julius Farr responded to my intial email and several subsequent ones.  He made himself available to me that same afternoon for a test drive.

Julius greeted me with a smile and walked me out to the car.  He gave me a complete and thorough walkthrough of the vehicle and guided me through the test drive.  As I was financed through my credit union, he brought me 2 different sales orders, one with a price that included a wraparound warranty and one without.  I did not think I had the budget for the warranty which I knew I needed with a 2006 model and left the dealership.  Julius was very kind to me and wished me well.

Several days later I called to see if the car was still available.  It was and I went to see it with my husband.  The dealership was extremely busy, which I expected on a Saturday, but there was always someone willing to help us.  We had our 7 month old twins in tow and Julius did everything he could to get us out as quickly as possible.  He helped us install our carseats, programmed a second remote, as the car did not have one for some reason, and helped my husband clean out our trade in.  It was puring down rain as we left and Julius pulled our new car under a tarp and walked us out with an umbrella so our babies would not get wet.

Everyone we met at this dealerhsip was wonderful, it is a clean facility and it is clear they are concerned with customer service.  I am thrilled with my new car and am grateful to Julius and Courtesy Nissan!",5.0
150,"March 20, 2010","I purchased my first vehicle on the internet.  I received quotes from several Nissan dealerships and Courtesy was the lowest. They had the best price on their website. While other dealers wanted to charge extra for window tint and other options, Courtesy put it in the deal at no additional charge.  Julius Farr was great. I had filled out my application on their website and all of the paperwork was done when I arrived. Fast and easy ...saved me money. Great people.",5.0
151,"March 15, 2010","I purchased a previously owned sedan 2007 Altima in beautiful condition. Within 5 days the vehicle would not start due to an electrical malfunction previously unknown. Although they were not obligated to do so, I was ""picked up"", given a ""loaner"" while they looked for the unusual electrical malfunction which was repaired, all at no expense to me. Their courtesy, ""going the exta mile"" and making every effort to see that I was not inconvenienced was very impressive to me.  John McFaddin and Doug Davis were wonderful. The dealership is Courtsey Nissan in Richardsaon, Texas.

152,"May 26, 2004",I was very disappointed in the service I received from this salesperson.  I contacted them through an internet site so I could get a no haggle price.  They gave me some pricing which seemed pretty good but I decided to go with another company that I have prior experience with.  I told the salesperson I was going with another company and he lectured me on how I made a poor financial decision and then hung up on me.  This was very unprofessional and I would never recommend this dealer to anyone.,1.0
