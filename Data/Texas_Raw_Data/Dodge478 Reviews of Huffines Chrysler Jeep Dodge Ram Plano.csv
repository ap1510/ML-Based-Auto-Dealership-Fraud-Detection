0,"May 26, 2020","I received an email from Billy Bolding of a Truecar price and agreed to pay that price.
Then Billy comes out and says ""Someone got in our system and lowered the price we can't sell it for that price"" (I have it in writing from him). Then he says he can sell it for several thousand more do I still want it??? really??? why not what you put on paper? why not the truecar price we agreed to?",1.0
1,"October 10, 2019","We have had a couple of Jeeps serviced here over the years, most recently a 2007 Commander with 202,000 miles.  It was starting to show its age and with their guidance we went through several service procedures to correct some drive train issues.  The overall improvements were achieved, but I decided it was time for a new vehicle.
I spoke with Thomas Bronte, Service Manager, and explained my thoughts and plans.  Again, he was very supportive as he was during the entire repair process. He connected me with the Subaru team, as we have been looking at the new Ascent since it came out.  This was another great experience which had me driving away with a 2020 Ascent. This is a great Service Department and working with Bill Buckley, Will Merck, Thomas and all of the support staff was a pleasure.  I highly recommend this dealership!

2,"August 19, 2019","I made a formal complaint about the vehicle I purchased from them, that is the Dodge model Journey GT 2018 and asked for a solution in this case. It was on July, 25 via e-mail. Until the current date (08/19/19) there is no response for this.

The features that were sold to me were not delivered, I mean, I paid for something I didn't receive and I'm very disappointed by it.

What was sold, what was my wish as a buyer:
The day I got to know the car, I was told that Journey's sound system would mirror the phone's screen to the car's sound screen. This was one of the main points for me to close the deal, and I complained that the system of Civic (the car involved in the exchange) was not the best (and was already mirroring the screen. In other words, I downgraded).

That was my wish, and that was the selling-time speech. When we did the test drive I could not use any of the features said, but it was in the background because we also had other car possibilities in mind.
Before closing the deal, everything was confirmed once again.

On the way home I had the same connectivity problem (even if it is connected to the cable it does not work even Spotify - music app).
I spent hours trying and nothing.
Speaking to the salesman he suggested bringing the car to the dealership to teach me. In doing so it was noticed that I didn't really have the system sold to me.
The Dodge technician said that the Dodge 2018 system didn't have that, but the Dodge 2019 system did.
The suggestion of solution then was to change the system to the one of Dodge 2019, I accepted as a workaround.

When communicating with the dealership during the maintenance period for system improvement, I was told that the new system would mirror and have the features as it was sold.

Some days ago, looking at the vehicle that would theoretically be with the new system, I was presented with the same system, but with Siri installed now.
Honestly that made me very, very disappointed with you.

3,"August 01, 2019","Never had a more relaxed car buying experience than I did with Billy Bolding.
Was waiting for the high pressure sales pitch and the hours and hours at the dealership....did not happen.  Mr. Bolding was just what I was looking for in a car salesman, knowledgable without pressuring me to buy or wasting my time.  When I gave him a list of everything I wanted on my new Ram Longhorn, he said we don't have it in stock, but I'll find it.  Nothing close by, so we ordered it from the factory. Delivered in less than a month and got a GREAT deal. Headed to the finance department expecting a stressful situation, nope. Charlie Hale gave me just the facts and no pressure. Was genuinely surprised by how easy the process went as I was not looking forward to stepping foot in another dealership after some of my past experiences.  Haven't taken my truck in for service yet (thanksfully), but I'll certainly give their service department a try.  Thanks again Huffines for exceeding my expectations.",4.7
4,"July 28, 2019","All of their staff and in particular my Sales Consultant Billy Bolding and the Finance Director Israel Barrera were exceptionally friendly and patient in helping me select the right the car, packages and warranty options that best suited my interest.  A true ""no pressure"" and pleasant experience. I have been buying vehicles from this dealership for decades and highly recommend it.  I'll definitely be a continuing repeat customer! ",5.0
5,"April 15, 2019","To those interested, my experience with Ed Lewis at Huffines in Plano:

Shortly after inquiring about a vehicle online, Mr. Ed Lewis called me within 10 min, at the time it was 15 till 9:00 PM. He answered all questions over the phone as best he could with the information he had at the time including financing options, similar vehicles, availability, etc. I told him I could be over in 30 minutes. 

He helped me look well at the vehicle in and out at my own comfort and helped look for any details. Gave me a test drive and answered more nit picky questions I had for him. Honestly I was a pest with the amount of questions, yet his politeness and professionalism not once wavered. All in all, the time it took to purchase my new vehicle was 2 hours. 

Even after I found a small scratch of a detail days after, Ed told me he would take care of me and my new car on a day he had off. He brought in my vehicle, fixed any small details at no cost as well as providing me a means of transportation for my work. Even throughout the plates and registration, he kept me well updated by text and call!

Ed Lewis provided exceptional service of a gentleman and a scholar that in my opinion went above and beyond, providing me a great, safe, well market priced vehicle. I would recommend Mr. Ed Lewis' service for buying a vehicle to all my friends and family.

12,"January 31, 2019","I stopped by Huffines Jeep to get a few questions answered about a new Jeep that I was thinking about buying. I walked up to a Jeep on display outside the showroom, and as I approached I was greeted by Adam. He politely inquired if there was anything he could help me with or have questions about. I started asking questions about the Jeep and after answering all my questions we went inside to see if they had a vehicle available with the options I wanted. Adam searched their database, made a phone call or two and located a vehicle with everything I wanted. He offered to get me a quote so I agreed and away he went to get it. Based on the sticker price and some previous research I had done, I had a fairly good idea of what a reasonable price would be. Adam returned with the quote and to my surprise it was considerably lower than I thought it would be. I agreed to buy the Jeep and the rest is history. It was pleasant, painless and efficient. No pressure, no hassle and no need to haggle. These folks do a fantastic job. Next time I’m in the market for another vehicle, you can be sure I’ll head to Huffines and get with Adam to make the deal.",5.0

And also to be noted me and my wife are from Houston and my father recommend me to come down to Plano Tx to do business with them and I have to say it was all worth it.

31,"November 02, 2018","I have been to many dealerships and bought and/or serviced many vehicles, but I would have to say the Morriss Tompkins delivered in a fantastic way.

I stopped at this dealership with no intentions of buying a vehicle let alone a used vehicle, but Morriss Tompkins soon showed me that my thinking was all wrong.  He greeted me pleasantly and when I told him that I was just looking, he inquired.  Morriss listened intently to what I was looking for and the price I was willing to pay.  He made suggestions in the new vehicles, but soon realized that what I truly needed was a Pre-owed Certified vehicle.  He took me straight to the vehicle and allowed me to take a look at it.  I was skeptical about a used vehicle, but he soon had me behind the wheel to give it a test drive.  He showed me some of the sweet features including the stopping and turning capabilities.  I even scared my sister when Morriss had me turn right without breaking at 30 MPH to show that the vehicle was safe and hugged the road securely.


Morriss was straight-forward with me and did not try to sell me something that I did not want nor afford.  He delivered on his promises and was the least pushy salesperson of any industry that I have ever met.


Thank you!",4.8
32,"October 30, 2018","I had an excellent experience with Huffines Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram Plano. I had the pleasure of working with Christina Vickers as my saleswomen. From Christina's initial phone call to me and throughout the entire car buying process, she was polite, friendly, organized, and honest. Huffines did not have the vehicle I wanted in stock, but Christina was quickly able to locate it and arrange for delivery. It had to be delivered from out-of-state, and Christina communicated with me throughout the process. Christina even followed up after the sale to see if I had any questions and find out how the vehicle was working out for me. I worked with Stewart Erickson in Finance, and had a great experience with him as well. He was very patient and fielded my many questions. 

I think other Dealerships could take some hints from Huffines on how to build rapport and relationships with customers. I will definitely be returning to Huffines to buy my future vehicles.",5.0

35,"October 11, 2018","I bought a car from here about a month ago from sales man Rickey Crochett. I bought a used 2014 Jeep Wrangler unlimited. The front floor mats and tool kit were missing out the vehicle as well as the balding spare tire and windshield wiper blades needed changing. When I purchased the car these things were included in the deal to be fixed, as of yet I only got the wiper blades and spare tire done. I’m still waiting for the floor mats and tool kit I was promised and now I conviently can’t get in contact with anyone.  There’s nothing personal about this dealership they’re just common car salesman like any other that will say anything for the sale. I will never come here again nor will I refer anyone here! The service department is just as unorganized as no one seems to know how to help you or whom to talk to. They don’t have any specials for servicing so they’re prices are extremely higher than others. I would try another Jeep dealer for any servicing needs as well as future purchases.

10/19/2018 UPDATE:
I would like to give a huge thank you to Jeff Summers over the sales dept. for reaching out to me. He definitely righted the wrong and I did receive my mats and tool kit! I very much appreciate the follow through because I do believe in great treatment=great reviews!! Thank you so much for making me feel valued and for that I change my ratings... Thanks Jeff ",3.4

63,"July 27, 2018","This was my daughters first car.  Because my previous experiences had been so awful I hadn't bought a car direct at a dealership in over a decade.  Instead I opted to go through a leasing company.  Since this was a used car I decided to go direct.  I was apprehensive and prepared to go through the nonsense.   

First, off our sales associate Orlon Hill immediately took my daughter under his wings and took queue that I was trying to have her experience the car buying process, vs just getting a car handed to her.  He immediately engaged her and treated her like the customer.  He walked her through the car orientation, let her do the test drive and answered all of her questions.  We teased her a bit during the price and finance discussion as we asked her to negotiate the terms.  Turns out that part was direct, no BS, strait forward and I was completely satisfied. I did my homework and know I got a solid deal.  Most importantly I didn't have to go through the grind to get there.  Huffiness was basically there already.  Throughout the process Orlon did a great job of explaining to my daughter how the process works, how car prices are set, why its ok to negotiate, how car payments are calculated, etc... It turned out to be a great bonding experience for us.  For sure my daughter gained appreciation that cars don't grow on trees.   

Second, the finance guys did us a solid.  I came in with pre-approved financing so that set the baseline.  They were able to work their system and actually got me 40 basis points lower rate from the same bank I had pre-approval on.

65,"July 09, 2018","Much like everyone else in the world, I detest the thought of purchasing a vehicle. I don't like the games. I don't like trying to figure out what the dealer is hiding. I don't like the enormous amount of wasted time. After visiting several other local Jeep dealerships, I was tired and cranky when I landed up at Huffine's. I had no plan on buying that day … just wanted to feel them out. Chris Dalluge was amazing. Friendly, honest and knowledgeable. I liked him right away (something that doesn't often happen at a dealership). He answered all my questions. It felt like he worked for my benefit. When I was passed off to Stewart, he had the same demeanor and same customer focus. I never once felt like I was being sold to or pushed to make a decision. It was by far the most pleasant buying experience. I LOVE my Jeep, and I will definitely shop at Huffine's again. If you are someone who hates buying a car, give Huffine's a try. ",5.0
66,"July 05, 2018","I met Will Merck during the summer of 2017. My husband and I were looking for an SUV for our growing family. At the time we were just looking, and told him we weren't ready to buy. Some salesman lose interest when you tell them you that, but Will was still engaged, very friendly, and helpful. We went back in September ready to purchase. I though I found the car I wanted online, but Will had a better car in mind, which checked every box I was looking for. He really paid attention to what I wanted. This car wasn't on my radar, so I didn't do my research ahead of time, but Will even came back and said the price online was cheaper, so I got a better price than what I expected. I truly appreciated his honesty. Fast forward to Summer 2018, I was in the market again for an SUV because of accident, and I immediately reached out to Will. He was just as helpful this time around, and seemed very concerned for my family's well being. I really appreciate Will and all of his help, and I would definitely recommend him to anyone looking for a vehicle.",5.0

I got the discounts we had discussed as advertised by the promotions on TV and therefore had a general price range before I came in. Mr. Kramer followed through on everything with no haggling.

89,"May 01, 2018","This is one of those times when I wish I could give them negative stars. 

My 2014 jeep was approaching the end of the 100k warranty so naturally, I wanted to get it into the dealer to see if they could diagnose the issues I was having. So I arrive to Huffines Plano as they’ve serviced the recall before and did a great job getting me in and out. 

Now when I got there I wanted to go to the same guy that helped me before but he wasn’t available. The person that was available was an older gentleman by the name of Bobby P. I explained to him my situation and that I wanted to get some things addressed before the warranty went out. He asked what issues I was having, I responded with “my transmission isn’t shifting properly and won’t downshift right when I’m trying to pass. I  also get a clunk into 1st when I’m slowing down. Lastly, the engine is shaking more noticeably and it seems down on power.” 

Bobby walked over to my jeep and said “well that cheap brand of tire sure isn’t helping anything”. I ask what that has to do about the transmission and engine shaking. He then popped the hood and says “well that shaking is absolutely normal. You see, there’s literally hundreds of explosions going off in there so it makes a little rumble”. What a terrible way to curve any further efforts to investigate my issues. I’m very well aware of how an internal combustion engine works. I tried to explain that this wasn’t normal and I’m afraid it might be suffering from the common lifter failure. I asked that they at least drive it and see what I was talking about. He simply said “I’ll just hook up a scanner”. He hooks up a scanner, reads the codes, and said “everything looks normal.” 

I was shocked. Too shocked. I asked if someone else could help and he said “the codes read everything is fine, there’s nothing we can do. They will tell you the same. Now, since your warrantee is on its way out, why don’t I connect you with a new car salesman. They offer a lifetime warrantee.”

Now, if I can’t get you guys to at least take my car in, see what issues I’m having, what could would a lifetime warrantee do for me? 

I understand this is a dealership and they want to make a buck. I usually stray away from dealers but this one handled my water pump issue so flawlessly, I decided to come back. I can’t believe how poorly my concerns were addressed. I will be reaching out to FCA and forwarding this review to them. This isn’t my first fiasco with the Huffines franchise. 

Buyers beware.

122,"January 29, 2018","When it comes to buying a car, Wayne Kramer and his team at Huffines Dodge Chrysler Jeep Ram Plano are the best. I decided to purchase my first new vehicle with them and they walked me through the whole process. They were patient, welcoming, answered all my questions and even made recommendations as to what they would do. You always hear about fighting for the best price and haggling but this team is honest, fought for me, and I got a brand new 2018 Jeep for an amazing price. They were dedicated in making sure I got the right vehicle and had a few different options. Mr. Kramer even took the time to walk me through the new radio and app system which helped me to not feel overwhelmed. This is the best service I have had anywhere. I am so glad that honest, dedicated, patient, and amazing people like Mr. Kramer, Mr. Stanley, and Mr. Hays are in this business.

I walked up the desk in the center of their display room and asked for a new car salesman.

I did not need it for a family but for safety and an actual second row seating you can comfortably sit in unlike most SUV's. It was a rare find for two reasons the Pacifica is a finely crafted line of engineered poetry and imagine discovering a Holy Man in a car dealership in the name of Andy Teston.

142,"December 07, 2017","So my husband and I started the whole car buying experience the last week of October. We started at Classic Dodge of Denton. While there we were treated horribly by the sales manager Keith. It was just one thing after another and he lied about us and our approval.

We than went the following weekend (first Saturday in November) to The Jeep Dealership in Rowlett Texas where we met with Chris and his Mother. By the end of the 12 hours of being there we were told we were approved for a 2014 Jeep Latitude. Perfect wasn’t what we wanted but that was okay it was new to us. And that’s were the worse two weeks of our car buying experience dragged on. We found out when we got the car home that Sunday that our temp tags were not legit for 45 days but rather 3 days. Than that Tuesday we found out that the paperwork we signed wasn’t approved and legit. It was a nightmare. It wasn’t until the following Saturday (Nov 11) when my husband and I called Huffines Jeep in Plano, Tx at 8:30pm. We were connected to Adam.

He listened and was very understanding. He asked how fast could we drive to them they would be there and open no matter how long it took. At 9:03pm my husband and I walked in. Adam, The Sales Director and a Finance Gentleman were waiting for us. Within in 30 minutes we had renewed hope. Saw the car we would end up buying.

That Monday Adam called said that by weeks end he was going to make us extremely happy. And honestly he kept his word. We literally by Thursday at 9am walked in got our new car which was washed, full of gas, and inspected. The Huffines Team lead by Adam is extraordinarily amazing and we are so thankful for them.

The week before last Adam (Wednesday before Thanksgiving) called to make sure the car was still fitting our needs. On Monday (Dec 9th) we received a phone call letting us know our plates were in and we could pick them up.

I pulled in today (Dec 12), sent a Text to Adam letting him know I was there and he responded quickly and seemed genuinely excited to hear from me.

We are going to be buying a second car in the next few months and we are already planning to be working with Adam.

Again, like the title said it Started out as the worse Car buying Experience and ended up the best!

Great Job Huffines and Thank you for dealing with a high maintence very demanding customer like myself!

He was beyond accommodating and no other dealership had even come close to the price I was given.  David took me back to wait in the lounge and I thought I was waiting to go to finance.  Within minutes,  I was brought in to sign the papers which I could not believe.  All the other vehicles I had purchased I had to wait and talk to finance, then wait for paperwork to be prepared which took forever.

The reason for going back to David wasn't because of how easy and great the experience was, it had more to do with after the purchase. Many times David was there for additional questions about the car, service and maintenance questions, advice for insurance issues, etc. He would always be there for me, and I know he always will.  There are many dealers I could go to that are much closer than the 250 mile trip to Dallas but I know I can depend on David and the team at Huffines to really treat me like family. I came back to David because he has made calls to my local dealers service department on my behalf when I questioned repair estimates (he saved me a lot of money), he helped me save money on insurance and he never pressured me to buy the Chevy or my new Jeep. He even used his day off to deliver the Jeep to me with the paperwork, spent the time to make sure I understood all of the features and drove my trade back to the dealership. I remember when I bought the Cruze he told me that he was more concerned about my second purchase than that one and I thought ""yeah sure"" at the time.  All I can say is ""wow!""

Easy to navigate and allowed me to narrow down your search before scheduling a test drive.  I was immediately put in contact with one of the most informative and knowledgeable Sales Associates, Andy Teston.  Andy knew every detail and was able to explain all available options about the vehicle I had selected.  Andy worked with me to obtain the vehicle selected while not exceeding my budget.  He even suggested I verify with my employer to see if I qualified for any employee discounts, which I DID!

Andy Teston showed me some Jeep Wranglers, answered all my questions, spent a lot of time with me and really listened to what I was saying and never made me feel pressured at all.  I wasn't sure that dealership had the Jeep for me, so over the next couple days I went to 7 other dealerships in the Dallas area.  I ended up returning to Huffines and looked for Andy because of the service and because I just had a better feeling about the experience there, and Andy spent much more time with me and we finally found a Granite Crystal Metallic Big Bear Wrangler which ended up being the perfect Jeep for me.  I also got to work with Zach Stanley in finance and had all my options explained perfectly and he was patient with me while I thought about it and finally made the decision to buy.  At the end, I had to return a rental car all the way out at the airport and Andy drove out there to meet me and drive me back to the dealership, while explaining features of the Jeep on the ride back.

They talked at me vs with me.  During a pause in the sales process, I called Huffines and spoke with Cory.  He was very genuine in explaining the process and very upfront enough I wanted to meet with him.

Met with Cory that afternoon.  He helped me understand the partnership program my work and Chrysler have and answered all the questions I could think of.  Although, I purchased a vehicle, sight unseen, he assured me that if anything is wrong with the vehicle when it arrives, we can cancel the contract.  We came to a mutual agreement on price and I even purchased an extended warrant from Mikael, who was also very friendly.    

Sure enough, when the vehicle arrived, the interior was a different color than I thought.  Cory and I met again the next day to discuss my options.  He was very understanding and even apologetic for not discussing everything in full detail.  Provided us options and also offered us additional warranty  services (stain, tear, dents, etc.) if we chose to keep the vehicle.  

In my opinion, Cory and Mikael did an astounding job making a sales, but also earning a customer.  We definitely will talk to our friends and family about the service experienced with Huffines, Cory, and Mikael.

Rubens professionalism, knowledge and care towards my family as people not just customers says volumes about his character and the type of professional he is. Zach Stanley also had our best interest at heart. He did extensive searching finding the best possible financing available and was even able to beat the bank that I have been a member of for 10 years. We appreciate all that this team has done for us and will certainly come back for our next vehicle purchase. Thanks guys! ",5.0

Huffines personnel, knowing our objectives, performed the inspection, gave us a clean report, and we bought the car. 

After being rear-ended in December 2016 we learned from Allstate Insurance that the car had actually been involved in a major rear end collision in 2015. A simple exam under the trunk carpet showed extensive and shoddy repair work.

The carfax presented to us was clean.  We also ordered a VinAudit which was clean. We then took and extra step and paid for an inspection with Huffines Dodge yet we ultimately were sold a damaged vehicle. Huffines now says the inspection was mechanical only. Very dissapointed",1.0

Our car had to be brought in from another dealer so David Maynard took over from there and did an excellent job of following through on all the details. He delivered the car to our house so we could test drive it and then had it ready to go at the dealership when we arrived. It was such an easy and fun experience.

From the moment we pulled our car to park, despite the fact that it was freezing outside, Ruben stepped out to meet us, After warmly enquiring about our needs, it only took about 15 mins to seal the deal. Ruben took it upon himself to prepare the car for our collection the next day. 
The next day, we had to have the funds wired in, Ruben followed through to ensure that the funds had arrived and inform us accordingly. We couldn't have asked for better service,

Our only issue was the over 1 hour we spent waiting for the finance guy to finalize with his client. As cash customers, we expect to be out in 5 mins or so. Maybe we could help here.

Otherwise, our experience was exceptional and that was only possible because of Ruben.

It ended up being 2 hours later when I officially decided on what I wanted. He continued his positive attitude throughout the paper work, even though it was time to close! He was with us the whole way. I hope that everyone gets this experience when they go to Huffines of Plano or any Huffines location. Sweet people who are ready to help with NO pressure.

305,"September 01, 2016","My wife and I purchased a 2013 Jeep Grand Cherokee back in 2012 and had a great experience working with Ruben Perez, our sales person.  He was informative, conversational, and yet not pushy.

Coming back this past weekend, I wanted to look at the new Renegades to replace my aging Ford Escape.  I asked for Ruben, and I was lucky to find that he was still there, but working in pre-owned.  I walked over and he not only remembered me but details about my family and our purchase!  

Ruben is fantastic, and you should definitely ask for him if you go.  He is what other car sales people should aspire to.  He not only really engages you in your needs, helps you make good decisions on trim and color (in your best interest, not his), but goes out of his way to get you the best deal he can.  He actually CARES about who he helps!  Servant salesmanship...   imagine that!

Not to go on and on about Ruben, but the other team members were good too.  Stuart in financing was great, and I actually enjoyed talking to the ""finance guy"", which is also unheard of.

I don't know if Don Huffines is a super lucky owner or fosters a powerfully positive culture in this dealership, but my experiences have been fantastic every time.  My family has had great experiences too.  Definitely going to stick with Jeep, and definitely going to to back to this Huffines!",5.0

309,"August 02, 2016","I have bought 3 different vehicles from Huffines in the early 2000's.  I tried to buy a Challenger in 2009 (Chrysler was actually closed at that time) and they wanted sticker?  I bought someplace else.  I tried again last year for a 2015 Challenger Hellcat.  They wanted $5,000 over sticker.  I had no problem going to another dealer and buying without the $5K markup.  Years ago, I used their service dept several times.  I don't recall any problems.

I guess they are understaffed.  I called earlier today regarding the airbag recall on the '09 Challenger.  It only has 14K miles.  Nice lady told me she was 'buried', took my number and called me back 3 or 4 hours later.  I think her name was Rose.  She left a nice message.  I called Service to schedule, she wasn't available (probably lunch) and was sternly told that I could not wait on the job but must leave the vehicle and they ""thought"" that they can get to it the same day.  The recall clearly states that it's a 1 hour job.  I wanted to wait on the car.  Oh well, other dealers will do the work.  Just wish the one 2 miles away would give a darn.  Maybe if I had bought at Huffines, I'd be on their 'good list'.",1.0

I stopped by Huffine's used car lot on my way back from another dealership on a whim, and I'm so, so glad I did. They don't play games here, they don't over promise, and they were one of the most reasonable places around.

Ruben Perez really did go out of his way to take care of me, and I ended up walking out of there with a car I love at a great price. The whole interaction was so easy and seamless. I really can't say enough about my experience.

Zach Stanley from finance helped close the deal. The transaction was done almost entirely over email. I've never had a smoother car-buying experience than the one I experienced with Huffines.

He was very patient during the negotiation phase and was quick to present a lot of data proving that their truck was priced fairly. He was also very conscious of my budget and helped me find a truck that fit my requirements and out-the-door price (which he didn't attempt to pad with any extra fees or useless services). 

The only thing I needed to do was fly down, test drive it and pick up the keys. (I needed to re-sign some paperwork since Ed found a better car for me after having sent the original paperwork via FedEx Overnight.) What would have been a 4- or 5-hour visit was reduced to about an hour. The truck was very true to what was listed online and the drive was as amazing as I expected.

336,"April 03, 2016","I have never had such a horrible experience from a service department.  My car was taken there after an accident. They failed to realize the motor mounts were broken. A few months later when things got really bad, I took it back and they said it was the transmission, even after I told them it was the motor mounts.  The adjuster Mike Otto was rude and condescending to myself and my husband.  His only interested was selling me an extended warranty.

He told me the car was fine and sent me on my way.  I came back again and insisted they check the motor mounts .  This time he admitted they were cracked and told me it's no problem that I was driving on them for so long. I was not at ANY risk!

While they were fixing the motor mounts they did an update to the Rado which caused it to go haywire. So after picking  it up, another trip back.

They ordered a new stereo/navigation system and after a few days called me to pick it up.  I left only to discover, after my steering  locked up in the middle of the highway, that the idiots didn't calibrate anything and the ENTIRE ELECTRONIC SYSTEM was flipping out.  Breaks streering, EVERYTHING!  I almost got hit by an 18 wheeler!

Back I go!  The Service Manager, DJ gets envoled.  Twice as arrogant as Mike.  He admits the car should never have left, but since I didn't get hit ""no harm no foul""  What??????

Let's not even mention the fact that the stress of all this had me having seizures 4 or 5 a day when I barely had one every 6 months, and had to be hospitalized.

When we finally picked up the car and they fixed all the foul ups, it was the day I was released from the hospital. They were even rude that day.  The GM called and offered me 4 oil changes for the trouble!   SERIOUSLY!   

DAYS OFF WORK, FAULTY JEEP, CLOSE CALLS ON THE HIGHWAY, STRESS OUT THE WAZOO AND YOU WANT ME TO COME BACK THERE FOR OIL CHANGES!!   I politely declined.  If I could give them a negative score I would.  DO NOT GO TO HUFFINES EVER!",1.6

364,"November 23, 2015","My husband and I were traveling to Texas for business and had decided to visit a couple different type dealerships to take a look at the vehicles available, if time allowed.  We visited a British auto dealership first that just happened to be the closest to our hotel.   We had a very, very,  short, strange experience where the salesman told us upfront that their policy that they would not sell us a new vehicle if we had a dealership near our home in our state,  Didn't wait to find out what that was all about, because we simply wanted to consider vehicles for purchase.  
Huffines was top on our list.  I had five vehicles I wanted to look at and a couple I wished to test drive.  The first question my husband asked Corey was if he could actually sell us a vehicle if we liked what they had.  We got a resounding YES!!!  Corey was so friendly, helpful, and patient.  I was able to test drive, look over, and given time to think about what I really wanted.  I keep my vehicles for longer than most, so I don't buy often.  Zach gave us all our options on our purchase and made it a great experience for us.  The next morning, they made sure that all that needed to be completed on our vehicle was done and we were given a loaner while they took care of details.  Zach and Billy enjoyed tempting my husband with the new Ram Rebel pickup while Corey took me through some of the setup in the Jeep.  We had much fun with these folks and they made us feel very welcome.  We very much enjoyed our Jeep Grand Cherokee SRT on the way home.  When we decide to buy another vehicle, it will be worth driving two states away to deal with these great people.  ",5.0
365,"November 18, 2015","As a person who trades vehicles more than I should, I have had experiences with many dealers in the North Dallas area for the last 20 years.  Many are good and just as many not so good.  This was our first buying experience with a Huffines Dealership and we couldn't have been more pleased.  Ruben worked diligently to ensure all of our needs and expectations were met and his professionalism and attentiveness sets him apart from your average salesman.  The majority of our deal was completed via phone and he was ready and waiting for us when we arrived.  The vehicle was everythiing that he described to us and it was ready and waiting on us to test drive.  After the drive we were off to finance.  Total deal time was right at an hour.  He took all the time we needed but was mindful not to waste our time.  Zach Stanley was a pleasure to work with in finance. He found a lender willing to do a rate concession and meet our lender's rates and had the deal ready to go as soon as we walked in. If Ruben and Zach are examples of the average Huffines dealership employees, they have set the bar high for other area dealers.  Great experience, great staff, and I give them 5 stars, which is rare for me.  Keep up the great work guys and we will definitely be back!

Greg & Donna Wilkerson

Once we decided on options/features and color, Mr. Bolding quickly located vans for us to consider and we selected the deep cherry red color.  Not only do we love it, but our grandchildren are really enthralled with all the features when I pick them up at school.  There is room for kids, backpacks, violins, etc.  The van is a perfect fit for us.  Mr. Bolding works to find the car for us and is not a high pressure salesman--just totally knowledgeable.

I understand my expectations shouldn't be too high but I expected SOME customer service. I walked around the lot and no one came to help or greet me the first 15 minutes. So I went into the showroom and looked at a Jeep for about 10 minutes and was not greeted by any of the 5 or 6 ""available looking"" salespeople, not even by the receptionist. So I went up to the receptionist and asked for help and each person she called didn't seem to want to help, finally the 3rd guy came up to me and asked how he could help, didn't introduce himself or even bother to shake my hand. Told him I was looking to purchase eithe a jeep grand Cherokee or a wrangler and (with at that point 35 minutes until closing) was told ""oh we already saved up the keys, can you come back another time"" I then said ok and walked out. I have no intention of ever walking back into this dealership after this service.

My son was looking to buy his first new car and was so excited when he found just what he was looking for.  Having just graduated from college and starting his new career, he was unable to get his paystub from his company's website.  Zach the finance person was not at all helpful and sent my son and my husband out of his office in the middle of the process and took another customer.  He was rude and after Orlon realized what was going on he got the finance manager to finish the deal for us.  My son first buying experience went from wonderful to ugly in a few short minutes.   I am so sad for my son and feel he was cheated out of his 1st buying experience by the lack of professionalism Zach displayed.  My son communicated that if he hadn't needed and loved the car so much he would have walked out.  My husband was furious and does not want to do business with them any longer.  I am just very disappointed that Zach felt it was ok to treat them that way.  My son went into that office alone and when he saw my husband he still was rude.

I showed up on Saturday morning and Mr. Lewis explained he was with another customer, but he would put me in the hands of Ruben Perez, and assured me that I would be fine. I was more than fine. The car they brought around for me to test drive was exactly what I had told  them I wanted. There was no ""Hard Sell"" and the time and effort Ruben put into telling me all about the vehicle was impressive. I was thrilled that I was about to purchase a 2015 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I then went on to the finance office to complete the process with Gadiel Plaza. What can I say but ""wow"" just the most pleasant experience.

I walked up and was meet by Hector the salesman and asked if he could help me. I asked if he could help me get the Challenger i test drove at the other dealership. I liked this car because it was the color i wanted, and had all the options I was looking for.
The experience at Huffines was very professional and up front, and with in a short period of time I was a proud owner of a 2015 Challenger. I can't say enough on how my experience a Huffines made me feel, and that the Hector listen to me and what i wanted, instead or steering me in the direction the salesman wanted this deal to go.
As much as no one like to go and sign the finance papers, Zach Stanley was very friendly and easy to work with, and made sure i understood all the warranties options and how i could add to the warranties that can standard  with my car.

I brought my Jeep Grand Cherokee into Huffines to get the mirror replaced.  Without quoting me a price, they told me it would be done within an hour.  Two hours later I hadn't heard from anyone so I walked upfront only to be told that they didn't even have the mirror in stock!  They said they could get it in 3-5 days and it would cost $610 for the mirror and labor!.  I drove to National Auto in Grand Prairie and bought a brand new factory mirror for $276 including tax and had a local body shop put it on for $55.  Their work is guaranteed for the life of the car.

At another dealership I told the salesman what I was looking for and the entire time he tried to offer me other vehicles in the same family or tried to make me feel like I did not know what I was talking about with the vehicle. That only made me want to walk away right then. At Huffines, Cory showed me what I wanted and showed me other options/features within what I wanted and the manager, Eddy, actually came over to us when we had it narrowed down to 2 vehicles I could possibly purchase. The personal touch that Cory, Eddy, Zach, Samir and Robert showed by coming over to where we were to introduce themselves and offer any help (which they did) made me comfortable. I ended up buying the vehicle I wanted and did not feel bullied into something I would regret later on. Definitely a company to buy from.

After four hours of waiting... The recall for the airbags was fixed, yet my airbag light still comes on. They told me an oil change with synthetic oil would be better for my car, but did NOT flush the old oil out (a fairly big deal as I found out later), nor did they inform me that by changing oil types, I wouldn't be able to use any other type of oil except synthetic. Then they told me that I would not be able to pass inspection unless they performed $1300 worth of repairs on my car.

I took it to a different inspection center and needless to say, it passed.

I had originally gone to Love Field Jeep because its much closer to me in Dallas, but their sales team had zero information on the new Cherokees.  Their only focus was to sell me on a Grand Cherokee.  No thank you on that kind of tactic.

First off the Lewisville parts department refused to allow me to return an unused part to the Lewisville location stating that the Plano location swells up if they return a part purchased from Plano. Really? After this I did not want to get my vehicle serviced at the Lewisville location and I called the Plano location, speaking with Wayne who agreed that they were wrong and that they people in customer service. I scheduled my service with Wayne for the next day at the Plano location after I told him of what I was bringing my vehicle in for and letting him know that I needed it back the same day. Upon arrival at the service department I was told that they would have to keep the vehicle overnight to get to it being it was hot outside and the AC guys do the work on the electrical stuff also and I should have called back in the morning to verify that what I was told the night before was still accurate. Yes, that is my job to re-verify your incompetence. If you need any kind of service it is my suggestion that you go to any other dealership vs going to a Huffines dealership.

First my salesman Mark A. and his assistant Jay, then to AJ C. in the financial department. On the evening of my purchase we were experiencing a torrential storm. It was around seven o'clock at night, it was lightening and the wind was howling. The HHR that I wanted was at the Lewisville location and my salesman braved the storm and drove to Lewisville to pick it up so I could drive it home that night. I over heard some of the men there receiving calls that must have been from worried family members due to the storm, yet they all made me feel as if they were there to assist only me, their calls were cut short in order to assist me. When my salesman returned with my new car he stood out in the rain to fill it up with gas, and then took the time to show me some important things about my new car, the XM radio and the OnStar and how to use them. He also set me up with the OnStar phone service where I was able to register and be assigned a phone number for my new car. I had to go back to Huffine's to have the zxylon coating put on it, on that day I was met at the door by Mark A. and greeted by my name. I was treated with the utmost respect and quality customer service.  When my car was ready, my salesman once again filled my car with gas,and asked if there was anything else he could do for me, even though he was assisting another customer when I arrived. I received a follow up call from My salesman, and from Huffines to make sure I was happy with my purchase.
 I had to call AJ in the financial department because I had not received my payment book from the bank, he helped me with that, gave me all the information I needed.
