0,"August 26, 2019","Buying my 2016 KIA Sorento off the internet from John Musoga at Velocity Mazda in Tyler, Texas was without a doubt the best car-buying experience I have ever had. Not only was John honest with me from our first phone conversation, he exceeded my expectations throughout the transaction. As you can imagine, buying a car sight-unseen from 1,700 miles away requires a lot of trust. John thoroughly and accurately described the vehicle to me inside and out. A few days later, he picked me up at the airport, drove me to his dealership, gave me a much-needed water break, and then showed me my new car- perfectly detailed and filled with gas! After we completed the paperwork, he gave me the keys and driving directions back to my home in Nevada . I cannot say enough great things about this man and his work ethic. Thank you, John!",5.0
