0,"August 08, 2019","We were unable to agree on a purchase price, probably my hard hardheadedness, but I want to complement the salesman that we worked with.  It was Nathan Findley.  I do recommend talking to him if you are looking for a Subaru.  Ralph Willis",5.0
1,"January 26, 2019","Armando,Mike,Andy and Doug..do an outstanding job helping people get the vehicle they want. Their personality and attitudes make you feel welcome and like part of a family. I will never go anywhere else and I will refer anyone I know looking for a vehicle to go to Hicks Subaru in Corpus Christi. You can't ask for better service anywhere..",5.0
2,"December 14, 2018","I would like to take this opportunity to express a few improvements that could have made out experience satisfactory. 

1. First time we went in to see the cars, the salesmen showed us two used Subaru WRX one of which was being “worked on” so it hadn’t been detailed and was having issues with the start button (should have seen this as the first warning). This is the one I liked since the color and style was what I has looking for so I told them I would be back the following weekend and I’d take my car for a trade in evaluation. The salesmen promised that the condition in which we viewed the WRX was not how you all normally do business (I.e. not clean/detailed) and that by the appointment it would be more “presentable”. At this point, my wife was not impressed and we almost didn’t return however I felt we should give them a chance. 

2. When we arrived to the appointment, the car was in the same condition as when we last saw it (a week ago). But we were assured it’d be detailed before we left the lot, if purchased.

3. Overall attention during the purchase was horrid. We weren’t even offereqd a cup of water and although we could’ve asked for one, every other dealership we’ve been through while purchasing other vehicles, water is the minimum we are offered. Looking back, we should’ve left, however I insisted we stay. My pregnant wife was ready to leave. 

4. Finally signed the paperwork after paying cash and trading in our vehicle (no loan) and when we went out to get the car it hadn’t been detailed/cleaned! It was vacuumed  but they didn’t even attempt to take the window stickers/tape or paint off. The excuse was that the car wash in the back was locked and no one had the key. Beyond disappointed at this point. 

5. Drove to get gas and waited 20 min while the card worked and then had to drive the representative back to Subaru. First time I’ve had to do that. 

6. Five hours after we drove off the lot the passenger window would not go up. I understand this is a risk when purchasing a used car but everything was in “great working condition” per the salesmen and we had checked during test drive. Just another disappointment. 

7. 24 hours after driving off the lot, the car would not move, however car indicated high rpm. Emailed the salesman who sold us the car three times to see what we could workout and no response was ever given until my cousin helped me call the dealership the following day and we spoke with David Cardona, sales manager. David was the only one who offered to take the car in for a diagnostic. Turned out the clutch was burnt and I was offered a discount on the repair. Nonetheless, it still left a bad impression in what this dealership puts out.

In summary, our experience was beyond unsatisfactory. We will not return for another purchase at this dealership and will advise friends and family to beware and reconsider other makes and models if we are left with the same disappointment after the repairs. 
also i didn't  receive my licence plate yet , after 1 1/2 month of my purchase.  ",1.6
3,"November 13, 2018","This dealership has gone out of its way to accommodate my needs.  They met me half way  (in Refugio) so I could see and drive an Ascent before ordering one.  They kept me posted as to the status of my order.  When the car arrived, Monty called me and the transaction went smoothly all the way.  I would buy from them again.  Both Monty and Andy were a pleasure to work with.",5.0
4,"October 22, 2018","Monty went the extra mile to help my husband get me in a new Subaru Forester! Extremely friendly team, and not too pushy! They’ll be getting our business again in the future when it’s time for my husbands new car! ",5.0
5,"September 27, 2018",I have bought two cars from this dealership and I am happy with the service. Monie -if I spelled his name right-is the guy to talk to. I was treated well despite my less than perfect credit and Monie helped me get into the car I wanted with a finance plan that worked for me. Anybody looking to buy a car should give this place a try first. The first time I saw them I went and shopped around afterwards only to find that my first stop at Corpus Christi Subaru should have been my last. They gave me a great deal on a very good car. All the service work was done prior to buying the car and I have had zero problems since. Anybody looking to buy a car should try this dealership. Just ask for the guy who helped me-his name is Monie.,5.0

7,"May 24, 2018","I purchased my 2011 Legacy at the Austin dealership which spoiled me for anything less than stellar service and trained professionalism. For 4+ years of having my car serviced at the CC Subaru I became so frustrated by my cumulative 1/2 star quality customer service that I broke down crying to my poor, innocent service rep this morning. I can only assume the dealer is at fault...I have NO complaints about the mechanics and about half the service people have seemed trained to some degree. I had a patch put on a tirevrecently and after found a brand new tire in my trunk for which I had not paid. The service people ask me about my service history instead of letting me know what my car needs. My future service will be elsewhere and I will buy my next subaru in Austin!",2.8

10,"March 23, 2018","Being a single Mom, my 1st car report, I was in an all too unfamiliar bad situation. BUT having heard positive experiences about Subaru Corpus Christi, I thought I'd give them a try. Not wanting to be turned down in person, I went to internet sales. Marisol was honest and kind even offering to bring me to location as I didn't have transportation! Long story short, I am not the do happy owner of a pre-owned 2013 Honda Civic!!! It's beautiful, drives great, gas saver and I am grateful that Marisol made my wish my reality. Thank you!",5.0

12,"March 08, 2018","After going to many dealerships and getting turned down, Marysol NEVER stopped trying into getting me into an affordable car! She made me have the best car experience overall.

I was super pleased and will definitely send anyone her way looking into getting a vehicle, thank you Subaru!!!",5.0

Although what I was looking for wasn't available she tended to MY needs to the best of her abilities and have me options. Not a pushy person, only does her best to help you. I highly recommend asking for Marysol. ",4.8

15,"February 28, 2018","Ken was great, he helped me and explained everything to me and was overall great throughout the entire process. I’m happy I was able to get the vehicle I did and I’m very appreciative of it and what Subaru could do for me.
In the below section there is no option for a new fiat but that is the vehicle I got, not a new Subaru as it says below.",5.0

24,"February 08, 2018","Marysol es una excellente trabajadora de Subaru. Cuando yo compre mi Crosstrek ella me ayudo mucho especialmente hablandome en mi idioma Espanol. Me dio consejos en escojer un bonito carro. Me guio y me enseno los modelos que tenian y me explico porque porque el Crosstrek era un mejor carro para mi. Me trato con mucho respeto , fue muy amable y cortez. Y hoy estoy muy feliz con mi Crosstrek!",5.0
25,"February 07, 2018","I really like that I was able to request help late hours of the night, which happens when your trying to look for a car, you can’t  sleep! So I entered a request on the site  and immediately they have a chatting system in which a rep will respond and tell youbthey will forward your information and assures you someone will contact you ASAP. So first thing in the morning Marysol called me and texted me and made herself available to me at my convenient time. She met me outside , greeted me , made me feel very comfortable. Didn’t hesitate to take me to one of their other lots  to look for what I was looking for. She made great suggestions and wasn’t pushy like you get at other places. She really knows her stuff and will go through great lengths to help you out!! ",4.8

30,"November 03, 2017","Mr.  Tamez worked for 7 hours straight to get me approved for my car, he found the perfect car to meet my needs, He also helped me find a reasonable insurance agency and had the agent come meet me at the dealership to take my initial payment so that i could drive away that same day. He went above and beyond what I would have ever expected and I definitely be making my next purchases through him and only him.",5.0
31,"November 03, 2017",John really helped us out and researched every option to get us into a good vehicle. He was friendly and explained everything clearly. A great experience!,5.0
32,"November 01, 2017","The dealership was average. The one I went to doesn't have a service center. They have a rather small inventory considering all the other dealerships around. That being said, the employees I dealt with were fantastic. I didn't feel like was being dragged around and pushed to buy something i was not happy with like the majority of the ""big"" dealers. They are very friendly and helpful. They listen and help you find what you are looking for. They were also able to get me financed with my bad credit and repo. I definitely recommend the employees to anyone looking for a great sales team. Especially Michael Shelton.",4.0
33,"October 31, 2017","This a great dealership and John was easy to talk too . He provided everything I needed.. he did not only sale me 1 car , but 2 for me and my husband.. he's a great salesman . I got a some good deals thanks to him.. ",5.0
34,"August 17, 2017","I recently bought a car there for my son.  It has been 4 months and he is still with paper tags.  The A/C went out.  Had to purchase a new tire because they are dry rotted.  Wasn’t even detailed and I still can’t get the sorry general manager to contact me.  
Don’t waste your time or money.  It will cost you more in the long run",1.6
35,"August 14, 2017","The car we bought was pulling to the right we request they fix the problem as it became very scary. Then a tmps light kicked on. They said they ordered the part, the sensor.  Wipers were bad no way they could pass inspection so they told me to get them and they would reimburse me, they refuse to pay me. The right front tire separated and blew out on my wife on the highway and she almost crashed going across 3 lanes out of control but she saved it. Warning stay away from these thieves. They sell cars that does not legally pass inspection. About the TPMS sensory in said they put it on somebody else's car when they said they ordered the part for us. Liars and thieves. When we went into the dealership the last time they took us outside so they could not be front of other customers while we were discussing the problem and threatened to remove me from the property even though I'm just trying to get my car repaired because they know what they are doing is definitely wrong and against the law.",1.0
36,"April 27, 2017",I recently purchased a 2017 Subaru Forester from Corpus Christi Subaru. Everybody was so helpful. I have never been to a dealership where the owner was so involved with my purchase.David Cardona gave me an amazing deal on my Touring. I left the dealership feeling good about my purchase.,5.0
37,"April 21, 2017","Bought  our first vehicle there to establish our credit only to end up with a vehicle that keeps turning off on us leaving us stranded! We only had our car a week! Our vehicle was not even detailed when we drove it off the lot as if that wasn't enough we are screwed out of $4,000 and now will have to pay more money out of pocket to fix our vehicle. This dealership is a prime example of the saying, if it's too good to be true. Heed the warnings folks. ",1.8
38,"April 19, 2017","By far the worst ever auto purchasing experience ever. This dealership discriminates against people who may have had a credit issue in their past & as well discriminates against ethnic cultures by cheating & stealing their hard earned money. They do not help your credit when your down, they lie, cheat , steal & mislead you, only making your situation worst. BE SMART & PURCHASE A VEHICLE ELSEWHERE YOU WON'T REGRET IT. For everyone we dealt with @ this dealership either lied, stole, cheated or misled us .",1.0
39,"March 25, 2017","So speaking of my knowledge of this dealership I can tell you from fact that a percentage of the used vehicles on the lot come from auction meaning that they are flood vehicles or have some other underling problem. Many of the vehicles will develope problems due to the fact that they were submerged in water. This fact is so apparent due to discoloring of interior carpets, electrical problems, and a foul odour. 

  Some salesman there will tell you the vehicles went through an inspection before going onto the lot, but I had seen vehicles come straight from auction right onto the lot after we put tags on them. None of the vehicles are detailed until after the sale. Once you purchase a vehicle YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR 100% OF THE MECHANICAL ISSUES. Some customers don't even make it off the lot before the car gives them problems. Often even on test drives cars will break down leaving the customer to walk back to the dealership.

    Now getting to the processes, you will be ushered into a cubicle and you will be asked to provide some ""necessary"" information before even being able to look at car. They will blaintantly lie to you about a credit check. The kind of credit check they do WILL harm your score! So these sales managers should be in jail. 

   Assuming you are smart enough and decide to split before being sold a lemon, you will be written a scam pre approval for an amount of money down you had not agreed to so that the ""banks"" can get you into a car. You will be told if you have your credit checked elsewhere it'll void you BS preapproval. DO NOT BELIEVE THIS!!!

   Going back to the inventory. I had whitnessed a new 2017 Subaru BRZ special addition inside the building be infiltrated by a rat. It is my belief that it had nested and chewed through several wires causing electrical problems. Going back to the used inventory, many of the cars are labeled incorrectly with the wrong year, in all cases a year newer than the actual vehicle was. 

 In additions, if you are oblivious enough to my stern warning, you will be lied to by GM David Cardona, GSM Nathan Arn, and the floor managers. Mike Zamora in Service will lie to your face and treat you like a subhuman regarding your service. Do it trust these people to fill up your windshield whisper fluid!!!! They'll fill it up with beer, just like the ones they drink on the job with!!! What a joke!!!! 

   I'm just scratching the surface on this dealership, I expect to gather more information to warn the public about the great big scam going on at Corpus Christi Subaru. 

I will be posting another review as I am not going to be able to fit everything in, I'll just leave you with the fact the the salespeople crest hostile work environments and some consume illicit drugs in the job. 

DO NOT BUY HERE!!!!!!!",1.0
40,"June 24, 2016","When I asked for the price of the Forester that I was considering the salesman took me to his office to get some ""necessary"" information. He said he needed to pull a soft credit on me to be able to see what kind of deal they could offer me. I specifically verified with him that I did not want a hard credit pulled and he said ""oh no this won't affect your credit at all."" The car they had on the lot was not my first color choice so I was not ready to commit to the deal. I tried to ask them about ordering the car in my preferred color but they were just too intent on selling the one on the lot. I left and went the next day to San Antonio (two hours away) and purchased the color I wanted from a very professional salesman at North Park Subaru. A week later I was devastated to see that the Corpus Christi dealership had indeed pulled a hard credit inquiry on me without my permission and which I will have to live with for two years. I called the manager about it to complain and he really just denied it and kept saying that it ""wouldn't have been a hard inquiry."" I even emailed a screen shot of the details to prove it to him but no response. I sent the information to the dealership owner and again no response. I highly recommend North Park Subaru in San Antonio, but would steer completely clear of Corpus Christi Subaru",1.0
41,"May 13, 2015","The service center sucks!! they took way too long to replace a default sensor, stating that they were waiting on the parts to arrive, but wanted my car to sit there waiting this whole time for a week, really?!!?!! And at one point when they performed my first oil change they managed to scratch paint off of my car door, in which I had to wait another 2-3 days by the time I received my car back with new paint!! Pay attention to how your vehicle comes out of the service department before you leave the lot, they do not care, because it's not their car and they don't give a xxxx.

The big boned guy with blonde hair seems as if he don't want to work in the a/c and hardly literally gets up let alone touch the keyboard, is very rude, and plain out seems uninformed/knowledgeable in the service department. He rather give you the run around answer so he doesn't have to do anything. 

Deal with Mike he is a much better service department person who will do his best to help you, is very professional, and  knows how to deal/handle a difficulty and frustrating situation without giving you the runaround or attitude.",1.4
42,"April 19, 2015","Bottom Line:  CCSubaru required me to put down a $3000 ""refundable"" deposit in order to be given time to talk to my wife who was at the hospital.  Gave decision (no) before start of business next day.  Nearly a month later and they still have my money.  I've received several variations of the ""checks in the mail"" excuse.  Submitted complaint through BBB.  Omar the GM flat out lied on his response saying that he had spoken to me (never spoken to the man in my life) and told me it takes 7 to 10 days to process a refund.  Never mind it was already almost 20 days.

Do not buy a car from these people.  They are out to screw their customers!  I was a fool to trust them, but I had not been warned.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!",1.2
43,"November 08, 2014",Great friendly staff our dealer Marcos was awesome as well as our finance guy Carlos. Definitely worth the drive from the valley! Great customer service and we got everything we wanted! It is our second time buying there and we will definitely keep going back!,5.0
