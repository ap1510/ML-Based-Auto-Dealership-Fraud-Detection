4,"April 02, 2020","in the midst of all the life threatening events, the AC in our one car went out.  I called Classic, received an appointment for the next morning and got the car back that afternoon.  They not only provided a ride home and for us, a family with one car, a pick at home to retrieve the car.  What wonderful service. ",5.0
5,"February 18, 2020","These guys are great. Got me in and out very quickly. Dave the sales manager gave me special attention, even went with me on my test drive! Although he had a million things to do, he never made me feel like I was in his way. He passed me over to Joe S and he was also great. No Pressure selling! I have bought a lot of cars and trucks in my lifetime, and this experience at Classic is at the top of my list. They were fair on the price of my truck and fair on my trade in. #GOCLASSIC",5.0
6,"January 27, 2020",David Holmen was fantastic! He had my wife in and  out of there in no time. We had a test drive and agreed on numbers within 30 minutes. It was late in the day so we came back the next day and everything was ready for us. The car was washed with paper plates on it already and all we had to do was sign the paperwork. We still got out of there in  no time. Overall it was a great experience. I will always work with David and Classic Autoplex moving forward.,5.0

15,"September 24, 2019","I always take my care here for inspections and oil changes. Unlike quick oil change places, they never come out and tell me I need a radiator flush or an transmission flush or filters or other stuff like that needs to be changed.. They are always honest with me and always take good care of me and my car.",5.0
16,"September 09, 2019","When sold this Ford C-Max, was told this was Ford's answer to the Prius, which we had come in to purchase.  On their recommendation, we bought the CMax.  We bought on the gas mileage we would get.  Sticker said 47 highway, 47 city.  We only drive in town.  We live on an island.  We have never gotten anywhere near this.  Lifetime, we get 30, and currently, my large gas Toyota is getting better gas mileage.  I brought the car in multiple times, but no one took this as a project. They said it had not broken in yet, First it was, they don't fully break in till 4-600 miles.  Later, oh no we hear it takes as long as 12,000 miles.  I am at 22,000 now.  NO DIFFERENCE.  They said it was my poor driving habits.  I use the coach on the dashboard to get maximum effectiveness for powertrain.  They recalibrated the software on the car..  Nothing.   I wrote to Ford and offered for them to come get it, take it back to the factory, rework it and put it back together right.  AlI I want is better gas mileage.  I drive a new car about 15 years.  Long time to be PO'd everytime you gas up.",3.8
17,"September 02, 2019","I know that as a customer I would easily be considered difficult and maybe not worth the effort. I was straightforward with my salesman and he followed my request. I have been dealing with Earl Wells in the Service Department for years, and he truly understands customer service and when he put me onto a salesman I am sure he gave him my information. Charles Lozano was able to close the deal and even went as far as to save me additional money. I found him to be honest,straightforward, and willing to make it happen. Great Job Classic Ford !!!

19,"July 28, 2019","Gifting an older Escape purchased from Classic to a relative, we needed to buy a new vehicle in a hurry. Went in on a Tuesday afternoon to test 3 different vehicles already identified from the Classic website. The sales rep met us promptly, we let him know which 3 vehicles we were interested in and within 45 minutes we had test driven all 3. After a brief conversation with rep we left with the info needed to make our decision. Late Wednesday afternoon we went back, gave rep our choice and completed the purchase. The bank we use is a local financial partner of Classic so we were able to quickly complete our transaction on the spot. For our convenience we requested to pickup the vehicle the following morning at 10 AM. Rep followed through with me by calling at 9 AM the next day to tell me it was ready to go. Great customer service, knowledgeable sales staff and large selection to choose from. I highly recommend Classic Galveston.",5.0

25,"May 19, 2019","I am a widow, and uncertain of how to buy a car. My daughter has bought the vehicles from Classic and encouraged me to go there. I did. Terry from finance,whom my daughter knew) was kind, extremely helpful, listened and helped me in several ways. He made me feel like I was making good choices i a financial range I could handle. He had the car brought out and even though I didn't say a word (except to say no yellow, no orange) he had a metallic blue fusion brought out. Oh my goodness ! I fell into deep like immediately. 
The young man who took me on the ride answered all my questions, showed me details and also did a terrific job.I can't remember his name, although Trace comes to mind. 
People in your service are well trained and extremely considerate..
Thank you,thank you thank you! Job well done!",5.0
26,"May 13, 2019","I brought my F250 truck in on Friday May 10. Which is a truck I bought from Classic Ford in Galveston. I called on Thursday May 9, and made arrangements to be there at 9:30-10 for a front brake job, look at my batteries they where leaking and my windshield wiper fluid sprayer wasnâ€™t working my truck is a 2017 model, so Iâ€™m sure why these are an issue with only 57,000 miles.  
When I dropped my truck off (at 9:30am) I was told by the service adviser that I will be waiting on my truck, when I called Thursday I was told it would only take a couple hours.  I sat there all day from 9:30am to 3:30pm) on my truck, when I would ask about I was told they are working on it  
To top it off I was charger for the 2 batteries which where less than 2 years old and was changed $45 to fix the windshield wiper issue. Again my truck is less than 2 years old.  
My family/friends has bought many cars from Classic (close to 10 if not more) I donâ€™t think this is a way you should treat a Value Customer. ",2.4
27,"April 30, 2019"," After using this service department for over a decade I was using their Internet Wi-Fi while waiting for my car to have the oil changed.   I could not access Breitbart news I got a pop-up webpage that said this website was blocked     The webpage allowed me to file verification if this was correct. And got a return trouble report stating the dealership blocked the website.    Therefore I will take my business elsewhere as I do not believe in censorship of news organizations whether they are right or left    

The  Service employees are good friendly and courteous.   Management decisions have repercussions  and the management made a decision not to respect all customers       ",3.2
28,"April 20, 2019","Best customer service in the Galveston/Houston area. Thank you so much for always going the extra mile to make sure Iâ€™m satisfied with any service.

29,"March 06, 2019","I shopped at several dealerships around my area.  After visiting with Classic I left to see what other dealerships might offer.  I found myself after every visit, thinking about my experience at Classic.  I ultimately ended up buying from Classic.  I really liked my salesman and the sales manager for Ford.  We went back several months later and dealt with both men again, purchasing my husband's Toyota Tundra.  I have recommended Classic multiple times.  ",5.0
30,"March 01, 2019","After months of looking, I found the car I wanted.  Mina was amazing in helping me process so much of it online, as I could not get away from work.

Brenda made the process seamless and we had a few laughs!  :)",5.0

32,"February 10, 2019",After searching all over the state and being mislead with bait and switch by multiple dealers I finally Found Mina Baher at Classic Ford.  He was straight forward with zero drama.  This was absolutely the easiest car purchase I have ever encountered.  The only thing that slowed the process was my hesitancy due to other experiences.  the car was ready when I arrived exactly as it was advertised.  the price was exactly as we discussed and there was no hoagie over add ons and extended warranties.  I just wrote the check and got the keys.  I drove over two hours for this deal and it was worth every mile.,5.0

34,"January 08, 2019",Bridget Gutierrez was beyond helpful. She made the car buying experience less stressful and did everything she could for me that day to walk out with the truck of my dreams. I am truly grateful. The whole staff was very welcoming from the moment you walk in to the moment your signing for your vehicle and the final handshake to congratulate you. Would definitely recommend dealership and Bridget to others. ,5.0
35,"January 06, 2019","We are full time RVers and were traveling from pensicola to Bolivar Peninsula. We have a 2012 F350  super duty towing a 20,000lb fifth wheel We developed a turbo coolant line leak on the way down and managed to limp it in to bolivar and unhook the trailer. The next day we made it to Galveston classic ford and explained the situation. The service department went above and beyond our expectations. They said they could do it on the spot about 3hrs work and the quote for price and labor was extremely reasonable, we were starving so the service manager volunteered to drop us of at a restaurant and pick us up when the job was done, which was faster than quoted. Definitely a class act dealership. I would highly recommend them to anybody in need of Ford related service.

37,"November 30, 2018",Everything was great except it took close to 8 hours to get the deal done.  The waiting was not fun.  The were great and even helped us get a custom license plate holder off the old car.  I did feel like they could have offered us more for the vehicle we traded in which was originally from them as  well.  I did feel like I got a good deal on the vehicle I purchased,4.4

39,"November 29, 2018","We are natives of Galveston, BOI al the way. This is the second time we have gone home to visit family during a holiday and left with a new vehicle from Classic Ford. Our last purchase was in 2015 when we purchased our F-250 Platinum. This year it was a 2019 Fusion SE. I honestly wouldâ€™ve gotten the top line Fusion had I not only been in the market for a car to go to and from school. Our salesperson, Charles, was very attentive from the moment we stepped onto the lot to the moment I arrived back home in El Paso. He gladly showed us all of the Fusion options that were available on the lot and let us test drive any that we wanted. He saw to it that we got every incentive and cash bonus that we available to us. The finance department was wonderful and we were out of there in no time, no hassles. We will soon be in the market to trade in my wifeâ€™s 2008 Expedition King Ranch for a 2019 Expedition Platinum and we will gladly drive all the way back to Galveston from El Paso to do so.",5.0
40,"November 23, 2018",Micheal was very helpful in getting me the vehicle I wanted. Ford Classic of Galveston went out of their  way to get the vehicle from other place. I really do appreciate that they did not try to encourage me to get something I didnâ€™t want. They helped me through the process and made easier while working with my work schedule .Thank you.,5.0

42,"November 02, 2018","While the car buying, negotiation experience was pleasant, I had a question after the purchase and left 3 voice mail messages for the Financial representative that I dealt with.  I did not receive a call back, so I called the sales person I dealt with to relay a message that I needed to talk to the guy.  We'll see if I get a call back.  

I guess that the dealership doesn't really care about responding after the sale...â€¦..even to answer a simple question.

44,"March 18, 2018","I purchased a F250 new Ford truck at the end of 2017.  I actually live in Tyler, Texas and had not been able to find the truck I was looking for here and felt some of the salesman in my surrounding towns had been less than genuine. I called Classic Ford knowing they had the specific truck I was looking for and spoke to a salesman who happened to be Jesse.  He was willing too make an excellent deal over the phone before I traveled down. He called me back a number of times as he said he would expeditiously.  I was trading in my 2009 Chevrolet truck and was a little skeptical that maybe when I arrived the genuineness would go away and everything discussed would become negotiable. However, the complete opposite was true. He kept to his word 100% and even when  the trade-in was more in my favor after my vehicle was checked out and had less value than we had estimated before arrival, he said he would keep his word and honored everything including a refund they were offering on line that I was not aware of until the day of the sale. I had looked around for a number of weeks and know he gave me an incredible deal and held the truck for me until I could drive down from Tyler despite multiple dealerships requesting the truck the day before I came. He followed up with seeking an additional rebate 1 month after I had bought the truck which he and his dealership did not have to do. This is a testament to the dealership and Jesse's willingness to not just make a sale and forget you. My wife and I were very impressed with his integrity, kindness, and genuineness which unfortunately is rare these days. We will drive to Galveston again for our next vehicle, especially if Jesse is there because I know I can trust him! We have purchased a number of new vehicles over the last 10 years and this is the best experience we have ever had.

45,"February 26, 2018","I purchased a new F150 from Classic Ford Galveston. My salesman Jesse was extremely knowledgeable, helpful, and considerate of my budget and needs in a vehicle. When I arrived he was there to greet me with keys in hand fort he specific vehicle I wanted to see. The finance department was great and had me in and out in no time. Jesse and Terry were phenomenal, professional, and courteous. I would recommend Classic Ford, Jesse, Terry, and Paul to anyone looking for transparency and ease of purchase.",5.0
46,"August 05, 2017","Went to go get a plastic modling piece replaced  on my Ford Explorer and spent 500 dollars and the new piece they put on was cracked. So i had to take it back to get it replaced again on a different day. Though they gave me a complimentary oil change i had to ask for  , the part the put back on wasn't put back on properly and i had to fix it on my own.  Keep in mind i spent 500 dollars and went back twice for this simple job. I was going to have more work done but after their repeated failure on such a simple job , how can i trust them with a major one i need ? This was a major disappointment from a highly regarded service center. The molding it self cost 150 and the labor was 127. They replaced another molding that didn't need to be replaced because they said it was cracked but i know for a fact it wasnt because i looked at it every day for the past 6 months and that costed 150 for the part. And honestly I will never know if they actually replace it because the first molding sits on top of the second molding, they clip together.  Bad experience all around. ",2.2

49,"September 19, 2013","I purchased two vehicles from Classic.  Round one was smooth... Then came round two, where I was placed in the hands of Trey Pugh - probably the most unqualified financing rep I've ever encountered.  Since I was to receive a GAP/warranty refund from my first purchase, I sent him all of the information he needed (odometer reading, payoff letter, etc.).  He took nearly 6 weeks to process it, after me sending several emails inquiring about the status.  He then had the checks mailed to a physical address I had when I purchased the first vehicle (where I did not live by the time he processed the refunds) rather than the mailing address I provided (and stressed that was where they were to send any mailings).  Since I hadn't received the checks 12 weeks later, I again emailed him inquiring about it.  He told me his office clerk would check on it the following day and let me know.  Two weeks later, I still had not heard from him.  So I emailed again... That time he was out of the office and said he'd be out until the following week.  The following week, when he finally had time to address a customer's issue, he emailed me and said it was processed, I advised that I hadn't received the checks and asked him to make sure they sent it to the PO Box (b/c businesses frequently ignore mailing addresses... as if people just jot in an extra address for fun).  He said there was no reason he would have mailed it to an address other than the PO Box.  But guess what.. he went back and checked, and sure enough, he mailed it to the wrong place.  I told him I'd contact the apartment complex to try to get my old mail... but realizing he screwed up , for the first time ever, he immediately called the GAP insurance and had them re-issue the check.  He emailed me and advised of this AFTER I deposited the checks (that I went and picked up from the apartment complex).  In his email, he said the warranty check was still good (though this didn't help that I had already deposited the now-bad check for the GAP refund).  So guess what the bank does... kicks back the checks, charges me ""bad check"" fees, and removes all the money from my account.  As it turns out, despite assuring me the warranty check was good, it was not.  Currently, by bank account is frozen and empty, and I haven't received my warranty refund from a car I traded in 5 months ago.  I'm not sure how, when financing is all you do all day long, you can screw up that many times.  It's clear he is just selfish and isn't interested in helping customers.  It certainly isn't affecting his bank account, though... So why would he, right?  However, if he were financing a car purchase, we can all bet he'd be Johnny on the spot.  I'll never, ever refer anyone to Classic as long as Trey Pugh is working there.  He's rude, unhelpful, and unprofessional... and has no concern for customers.  (Really unfortunate, b/c some of the other people who assisted me in my purchases actually were kind and helpful).  ",2.2

54,"April 07, 2012","I had been researching and found a few car's out of state, so I knew how much I could get the car I wanted out of state.

I went to some Ford dealers here in Arkansas and first place I went to I felt like they didn't care I was there. They didn't want to talk prices with me without me giving them my Name, number, address. I didn't and told him I didn't want mine or his time wasted I just wanted a price of a car! That just seemed to piss him off! He went ahead and got me some price's for the same cars was $2k more than I could get it in Texas or MO. 

When I told them that they didn't seem to care actually they sales guy had a poor attitude. Well I didn't mind spending a little more, but 2k I don't think so!! 


I was frustrated and decided to get the car I wanted.

 I remembered that a guy I work with has a son that worked at a dealer in Dallas, Tx area. I got his number called him and he worked at the Classic GM dealership but he got me in contact with their dealership down in Galveston!!


I had a great experience at Classic Ford in Galveston, TX! Everyone was great to deal with! And the just my experience OVER THE PHONE!!!

We made the deal over the phone! It was hard to believe it was that easy but it was!


That's why I flew from Little Rock, AR to Houston, TX .

The service just as good in person!!

 My salesman David Holmen picked me up from the airport and took me to the dealership.

I had all my fincining do before hand so all I had to do was sign some paperwork and we were done.


This was the first brand new and couldn't be happier with Classic Ford. I was treated with the greatest respect and friendly service from everyone in the Classic dealership chain.


I highly recommend this dealership! And will buy my Next vehicle from them.


Thanks again everyone!!
