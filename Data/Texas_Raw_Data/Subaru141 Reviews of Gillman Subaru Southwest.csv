0,"June 16, 2020","This review is from an used car purchase perspective, and I strongly advise you to not purchase an used vehicle from this dealership. Do not be fooled into believing that this is a great dealership based on Subaru purchase reviews, that is how I was taken advantaged of.

We went in two months ago because of an used car we thought was priced well and solely went to the dealership for this particular vehicle. After having a car for 20+ years, it finally went out on us and we wanted something we could pay off quickly and sustain us until we purchase a like-new vehicle down the road.

We were paired with John Nguyen. The vehicle was brought around to the front, and this should've been our first flag. Be warned, the pictures that are posted online deliberately do not showcase the imperfections of the vehicle. The vehicle had a cracked windshield, missing door leather, dents, paint chips, rusting in the door, cracked trunk plastic, etc.

John informed us of the exuberant inspection that is done on every Gilman Suburu used vehicle before it is listed on their site for sale (remember this, it will be important later). This inspection is an added fee to the vehicle of nearly $1,000.

We make it to the financial advisor and go over all financing details. We purchased an extended warranty and asked if we would come back to Gilman Suburu for repairs, he said yes (this detail will also be important). We leave the dealership in our new car.

Two weeks later, I'm informed that my tag and plates have arrived. I leave work and make it there in the evening. I head to the receptionist who asked John to help me with my plates. John, unfortunately, seems frustrated and irritated to assist with this. I do understand wanting to get off at a certain time OR possibly being busy, but as a professional, I've never dealt with my customers as if they're a nuisance. This, will be flag number two.

Two weeks later, the car begins to smoke for no reason out of nowhere. I bring in the vehicle, extremely confused, because a vehicle I've purchased a month ago is already smoking randomly, which is definitely cause for concern. Especially considering this vehicle was only taken to Southwest Louisiana once and a few trips to Katy from the Galleria-area. Other than that, this car was used for commuting from Galleria to Sharpstown, straight shot, during the work week. 

I make it to the service check-in area and wait to be assisted. As I am waiting, a service attendant tells me that I should look into getting an alignment and new tires since they're worn and asks me when was the last time I got an alignment. Now, after a nearly $1,000 fee for the mechanics to do this phenomenal inspection, you'd think that something as simple as an alignment would be basic to a dealership selling cars to the general public.

I inform her that I purchased the vehicle from this dealership a month ago. She gets frazzled and proceeds to tell me that driving down a bad road for a month can make a car require an alignment. That didn't make sense to me at all (flag number three). I am no car expert, but according to this employee, if you commute to work, in Houston, you should expect to get an alignment every month because of bad roads. This let's me know that this wasn't done before the car was listed for sale. She was able to tell me this in fifteen minutes of my time being there, so, apparently this issue wasn't noticed during an used car inspection? It gets better.

I'm finally called to approach the desk by Mr. Diaz (if I recall his name correctly). I explain that my vehicle is smoking and I am very concerned. Everything was fine, until he found out I didn't have a Suburu vehicle. He smugly let me know that I was taking my Honda to a Suburu service center. I informed him that I purchased this Honda vehicle from this dealership, and was informed by the financial advisor that I could return the vehicle to this service center for service. He then attempted to get the used car manager on the line, but, he was off but I overheard him say ""as-is"" in their conversation. 

He then informed me that it may take awhile to look at my car because it isn't a Suburu vehicle. Apparently, Suburu has Tony Stark-level technology in their cars, so, the Honda build would take so much longer to figure out since non-luxury car companies such as Toyota Chevy, or Honda, aren't built very similarly. I had a V6 engine, no hybrid, no electric, a good old standard gas vehicle. 

All of this to say, I've taken our vehicles to different service centers of the years, and I've never been told by a service person in my life that because the car was different from the specializing dealership, the time working with the car could take longer. 

Some time goes by and Mr. Diaz pulls me outside to show me the engine and let's me know there appears to be leakage from a gasket which may be causing the smoke. Now, Mr. Diaz was able to look after five minutes to make this assumption. So, how wasn't this noticed during an used car inspection that tacked almost one grand into my purchase price? 

On top of this, they wanted to charge me to look at a car that I brought from them thirty days ago that has begun smoking. He then tries to find Mr. Nguyen for me who was working that day, but couldn't be found during the time I was there to see him. A ""coincidence"", I suppose.

I was then pulled by another salesman who was trying to sell me a car as I sat at Mr. Nguyen's desk waiting to be helped. He didn't know what I was there for but was helping John by trying to sell me a car. Little did he know, I had already purchased my vehicle and went into the same dismissive state as Mr. Nguyen and Mr. Diaz. I left after becoming frustrated with the whole situation, since I strongly believe that if I am coming back a month later with issues, I should be assisted and not dismissed.

Three weeks later, the car begins not to start, nearly stalling in the middle of the street, and we barely made it home. I refuse to return to this dealership, so I schedule an appointment with Spring Branch Honda. On the day of the appointment, I call Gilman at 9:00 AM on the dot, because I was having issues confirming the details of my extended warranty and wanted to be clear on what to expect as I brought the car to the new dealership to possibly get a new alternator (the issues I was having coincided with a bad alternator).

I was told by the receptionist the financial advisor wasn't in yet but she asked for my name and number and he should be in around thirty minutes later. Do you think I received a call back that day (the answer is no).

I make it to Spring Branch Honda and an hour later, the lead mechanic confirmed it was the alternator and guess what else he confirmed? My gaskets were leaking. He asked how long we had the car and was surprised when we said we purchased the car a month ago, not from a corner used car lot, but Gilman Suburu. 

Now, recall the mind-blowing inspection that was supposed to have had taken place before the car is placed for sale at the dealership. Now, remember a month ago, Mr. Diaz was able to tell me after fifteen minutes that my gaskets were leaking. I'm no car expert again, but these things can happen within a month, two months of purchase without showing any signs of issues before our purchase? You'd think an issue like this would be fixed before putting for sale OR informing a potential buyer of the issue. Well, since my car is over 100,000 miles, I'm looking at $2,000+ in repairs to my car.

Spring Branch took care of us in an hour, and let us know to come back soon to see what they can do about to gaskets. I've had more customer service in three hours at Spring Branch Honda than the multiple instances of going back and forth with Gilman Suburu and trying to get assistance.

Moral of the story is: If you're buying a brand-new or certified used Suburu vehicle, you're going to be treated like royalty, I assume from reviews and from the experience I had when employees were under the impression I was a Suburu owner. If you dare step foot in that dealership to purchase an used vehicle, be prepared to be discarded as you walk off the lot with your purchase and pay for what was clearly neglected during the used car inspection.

Now, I had no expectation of the engine being disassembled and rebuilt before sale. Not at all. But, for me to be told an issue after fifteen minutes, AFTER paying nearly one grand for this up and down inspection of the vehicle a month prior, then the issue being confirmed after a diagnostic at another dealership, is despicable and outrageous.

Don't waste your time here, or your money for an used vehicle. If you're dealing with anything that isn't Suburu here, AFTER you purchase the vehicle, of course (they're all bubbles and sunshine before you purchase), you'll be met with an elitest attitude. Believe all of the negative reviews, they're not exaggerating. Also, avoid Mr. Nguyen, as we asked questions, all we were met with was, ""I have no idea, you'd have to ask ____________"". He definitely won't want to do anything for you after selling you the vehicle. ",1.0
1,"June 02, 2020","This is probably not something to brag about but honestly it leads to why I'm willing to give a car dealership a 5 star review.  I recently just finished purchasing my 4th car in less than 4 years from Gillman and I have had nothing but the best treatment each and every time.  All the staff there are very professional when I come in, I never feel any pressure to purchase upgrades or get a better model.  I do not feel accosted they I do at some many other dealerships.

I've worked with a number of different sales individuals, finance individuals as well as service professionals and never felt like anything but an extremely valued customer.  Both Javier and Eliel have taken fantastic care of my husband and I (my husband has his only stories to share that Subaru can back up, we're coming for that 20 car punch card!).  

I have never been a repeat customer with a car dealership before but because everyone there is so fantastic and the deals they work in addition to taking care of me when I need work done on my car I will not go anywhere else.  Thanks guys! ",5.0
2,"November 11, 2019","Classic bait and switch.  The prices this dealer lists on autotrader are false.  It is false advertising.  The cars they list are not for sale at the prices they list the car.  They list the car cheap and then when it comes time to complete the sale they will come up with some made-up adder to the price, so you will have wasted your time.  It should be illegal and it probably is.

My specific case, I chose to look at a specific car (Jeep Grand Cherokee) that they advertised on Autotrader for $15991.  I went to see them because it was a good price (on the lower end of the KBB estimates) and was prepared to pay the advertised price plus tt&l.  Once we test drove the vehicle etc., we then sat down to complete the sale.  I had the printout of the advertised price and vehicle with me.  They made we wait while the salesman talks to the manager like every other ""bad"" dealer out there.  Salesman came back and said that they were adding $1600 to the advertised price for something called ""MVA"".  He explained that the advertised price is what they (dealer) paid for the vehicle and the MVA was the amount they had to invest in the car to get it ready.  All lies, but to which I answered ""I don't care what you paid for it.  You advertised the car for sale at $15991 (advertised price) and I come out here and you switch it to a higher price.""  They don't care.  It's just a classic bait and switch operation.  Stay away.  Their prices they advertise mean nothing.  The prices are only the ""bait"" to get you to come to them.  They know most people don't have enough time to walk away and I guess most customers just swallow hard and take it.  Unfortunate that we (consumers) have to deal with dealers like this.  I explained that the whole transaction was a bait and switch (in no uncertain terms on the sales floor), but neither the salesman nor the manager care.  They are there to screw you.  Beware.",1.0
3,"September 14, 2019",Great experience with zero intimidation or pressure. I would definitely use this dealership again and recommend it to my friends and family. Super easy process buying and trading in.,5.0
4,"August 23, 2019","I purchased a 2016 Subaru for my grad school bound daughter.  We did a trade-in and made full payment on the balance of the Subaru. All I can say is the salesman and finance manager were all about getting the trade-in handled and our payment and not at all about providing what we needed as their customers (which involved timing of getting the title and license plate and which we advised them at the time of the sale).  The information provided by both at the time of the sale was not accurate and communication to get accurate information very difficult and it cost us time and money down the road.  If we had not reached out to someone else at Gillman, we would still be sitting and waiting for the title and license plate which had not been applied for until we inquired further.  Also, the car we purchased immediately starting showing signs of issues, starting with the ignition.  I will never use Gillman again for any vehicle purchase.",1.4

6,"December 28, 2018","I purchased a two year old Subaru and had a few hiccups but didn't think anything of at the time.  Now that I have bigger issues, all the pieces are forming a picture of this company and it's employees.  First of all, my second set of keys didn't work and I was told they would be reprogram them.  I called week after week just to be given excuses...eventually, the salesperson told me there never was a second set of keys with the remote starter.  The salesperson told me the car was Certified Pre-Owned as it was labeled on the windshield--just found out Gillman cancelled the CPO warranty just after I purchased the car.  Yet, when I went in with minor issues, I was always told we'll take care of it under your warranty!  Before I finalized the sale, the salesperson stated he would have service fix the side view mirror control as it was broken.  Excuses again....and it never was repaired.  I have been taking my car for an ongoing issue that they haven't been able to resolve.  I've taken it many times but they haven't been entering all my visits as I now have found out.  Dealing with a few different service advisors, I've been told various things regarding how the issue was fixed.  They never have a loaner to give out except one time when they kept my car for over three months!!!  This was for another issue  and every week...I was told they had to change a sensor or another part because the problem was still present.  Due to the first persistent issue, I've had to involve Subaru of North America.  Because of the pending case, I now am finding out about the lies I have been fed and how they didn't leave a paper trail with all my visits.  One of the things I found is that they changed the timeframe of the loaner given to me from Sept 2017 - Jan 2018 to Dec 2018 - Jan 2018...they claim they only had my car for about three weeks.  Subaru of N.A. contacted Gillman Subarau Southwest and was told they had my car about three weeks.  I'm glad this conversation happened because it shows Gillman does lie about what actually happens.  I say this because I have proof that has been verified when I received the loaner and when it was returned.  After being given a run around, I finally received my service history or what they selectively entered.  I called today for the fifth time and put on hold.....a guy comes on the phone and is complaining to me.  It was another customer they connected to me and he thought I was an employee at Gillman!!!  I told the other gentleman that I am a customer that was put on hold.  I definitely don't recommend Gillman in any way.  FYI...they have an extremely high turnover rate with service advisors and members of management on the sales floor as well as the service department.  ******I will update once my case is resolved.******",1.0
7,"November 21, 2018","I just had the best car-buying experience of my life. I had leased a vehicle from these folks last year and I received a call last week asking if I would like to ""upgrade"" my lease to a new model for the same price. I, obviously, thought this was just a ploy to get me on the hook, so I spent some time texting and chatting over the phone with the salesman, Wyatt Bryson. He assured me that he and his manager had drawn up a new lease on a brand-new Forrester matching exactly the same terms as my old lease and that my monthly lase would only be going up by $13. I told him I would come in, but that he had better not be messing with me, because this all sounded WAY too good to be true. I also told him I had very limited time, since I have two small children. He told me he would have the car washed and gassed-up for me when I arrived and that all I would need to do is sign the paperwork they had already drafted for me. 

Well, believe it or not, it really did happen that way! I showed up at 8:15pm, Wyatt showed me all of the new features on the new Forrester, we took it for a spin, and I signed a new lease for just $8 a month more than what I was already paying on my old Forrester. And the 2019 model is WAY nicer than my 2018 model. Wyatt had all of my questions answered and sent me off in my new car VERY happy by 9:15pm. That's right, I was only at the dealership for one hour! Like I said, the BEST experience of my life. I will definitely be sending all of my friends and family to see Wyatt at Gillman Subaru. I also have to give a shout-out to Taha in financing for explaining all of the paperwork so seamlessly, for helping keep my payment low, and for throwing in the extended maintenance for free! These guys are awesome! ",5.0
8,"October 10, 2018","I gave the 5 star-rating because of Salesman-Alex Razai. After visiting 3 Toyota dealerships and 1 Honda dealership in Houston I finally found someone who I wanted to do business. I left each dealership prior because of the lack of attention, care and customer service . Alex was very helpful and honest from beginning to end and was an absolute pleasure to work with. He really made the experience enjoyable. 

I test-drove three different vehicles with Salesman, Alexis and he was also a pleasure to work with. There was no pressure or pushiness from either salesman and that was the best part.

The dealership offers lifetime engine and transmission warranty on their pre-owned vehicles, which sealed the deal for me. There were many vehicles to choose from and Alex was determined to get me into the vehicle I wanted.

The finance department was very thorough and patient. 

I highly recommend this dealership. Save yourself the hassle...I spent days searching the internet for sales, hours driving and too much time wasted at other dealerships. Come here, work with Alex and you won't regret it! Following the deal they do give referral bonuses so if you found this review helpful and enjoyed it let them know you read this review by Bianca!

Best car buying experience we’ve ever had. Will definitely refer friends. And we LOVE our Outback. Thank you Gillman. ,5.0
11,"December 02, 2017","Bought my Subaru here in 2008. For the first 4-5 years, everything was great, then started noticing new faces everytime I went for service... also noticed a huge decline in the quality of service offered.

Last few service appointments were late, their ride home policy is totally ridiculous and dont expect a loaner if its not under warrenty.

Loyalty and relationships dont mean anything to these people... I may try west houston subaru or I will get rid of my car...",1.6
12,"December 30, 2016",My aunt dropped off her car on Tuesday at Gillman. It is Friday and she still doesn't have her car fixed. I forgot to mention this is the 100th time she had to take her car in for the same problem. The dealership has not offered her a loaner car and on Friday they still had not contacted the insurance company to get the process going. This is the worse customer service I have ever seen.,1.0

16,"September 23, 2016","I recently purchased a 2016 Crosstrek at this location, and then was in a minor collision a month later. I called during business hours three days in a row and left two voicemail messages, and my call was never returned. I chose to take my vehicle to the location it was appraised instead. Horrible customer service. ",1.0
17,"April 06, 2016","I leased a 2015 Crosstrek from Jana in November last year. I was at the dealership few days ago, for the first oil change and Jana offered me a 2016 brand new Forester for the same monthly payments, with no money out of pocket. I didn't think this was possible. I was extremely happy when I saw the new lease contract showing the exact same note for a bigger, newer car. I'm very happy with their service and would definitely recommend Jana for helping with the purchase. Very professional and honest. ",5.0
18,"March 27, 2016","I have a 2001 Subaru Outback with 170K miles on it.  It is a great car but of an age that you think about trading it in versus spending $ on maintenance.  Last year I went in because of some issues and opted to have the work done.  This year a few more issues but again opted to have the work done. Both times the Service Dept. was amazing. Between both visits I spent some $, but so worth it!  They valued my business and took care of several small things at no charge and got Subaru to cover some others under warranty that I did not expect. Everything was done as agreed and the car was ready when they saud it would be.  I've also had two follow-up calls to make sure everything was fine. Very impressive.  When it does come time to trade in my beloved Outback, I will buy from Gillmans.  Of course I expect to get another 100K miles on my 2001, so it won't be for awhile. :-)

19,"March 20, 2016",I recently went to Gillman Subaru to test drive  a 2015 WRX. Once  there i was met with a nice sales associate Zia. We test drove the car and then talked back and forth about price. I wasn't looking to buy but the offer was good and i went for it anyways. There was some small discrepancy with the finance but Elil Ramirez the GM went above and beyond to rectify the problem. Overall it was a good experience.,4.0
20,"January 25, 2016","I went into the dealership (Gillman Subaru Southwest) on 10/21/2015 to test drive and purchase a certified preowned 2015 WRX. I had my own financing and a check for the amount of the vehicle. While there I was told the dealership (through Subaru) could get me a better offer on my financing and was asked if I would let them try. I agreed and they came back with a better offer on financing. Everything seemed good at this point. Everything agreed, paperwork signed, $2000 down payment and drove away in my new car believing that the deal was finalized.
5 days before my first payment was due, I called the dealership as I had not received any paperwork from the bank. I was told that the original deal had fallen through and that I would require a new finance deal! I asked why had this not been brought to my attention sooner and why did I have to contact them about it. I feel that I should have been informed of this as soon as the dealership knew about it! I should not have had to contact the dealership to find out this information.
In speaking to the General Manager I was told that they would need to take the car back if they couldn't obtain a new financing deal. I was devastated at the thought of losing the car and it caused me a lot stress and anxiety as I would be without transport. At every step to this point I was the one who had to make contact. I was PROMISED multiple times that they would call me and give me an update on the situation. These phone calls never came and I had to call them every time! This in itself is an example of terrible customer service.
I went back into the dealership as they had a new finance offer for me. It was at a higher interest rate at an extra $50/month over the original agreement that had been signed by both parties. I later found out that I also had a further 20 hits on my credit report!! I agreed to the new offer and they washed my car and let me pick out a free accessory for the trouble they had caused. At this point everything seemed to have been worked out...
Again, about 8 days before my first payment was due I had still not received any paperwork for the loan. I called the dealership and was told that they would get back to me. This call never came, I had to call them again to find out what was happening. I was told that there had been some mix-up in their accounts department and that the finance deal had not been issued to the bank. They were very vague and I was told that the person handling it wasn't available at the moment and that they would call me when they were free. I never received a call back! I decided to call the bank and they had no record of me, my SSN or the VIN number of the vehicle. I called the dealership and was told that they were taking care of it and that I should have the paperwork within a week. One week later and I still have no paperwork and the bank still have no record of me.
I was told several times that Gillman would respond to my queries in a timely manner and that I would be contacted. This did not happen once! I had to call Gillman every time. This is the worst experience I have ever had in buying a car, in fact it is the worst experience I've had in buying anything! The level of customer service is atrocious and out right shocking. The fact that I have had to make contact every time to find out what is happening is beyond ridiculous!

Steer clear at all costs!",1.6
21,"December 30, 2015","I worked with James Rutledge in the Internet Sales department in purchasing a Subaru WRX Limited.  Unfortunately, they did not have any Limited's available and weren't scheduled to have any for another month; only one dealership within several hundred miles of Houston had any Limited's on the lot at the time.  I ultimately purchased from another dealer.  James was absolutely professional and patient through the entire process.  While I wasn't able to purchase the vehicle I wanted at Gillman Subaru of Houston Southwest, it will be my dealership of choice when I am next in the market for a Subaru.  Excellent customer service.",5.0
22,"October 30, 2015","After trading in our Outback for a Forester, we starting receiving phone calls asking for a copy of my drivers license.  Dealer stated that they needed it for the bank that held the loan on the Outback.  I contacted the bank and was told that they would need my signature as I co-signed the Outback for my wife.  When I informed the dealer of this, they then informed me that they needed for the DMV to get the Title on the Outback.  I informed them that they had not given me any documents to sign and without my signature a copy of my ID was worthless.  I was then told that if I did not give them a copy of my ID they would not payoff the remainder of the loan on the Outback.  I asked several time that they send me the documents to sign and at that time I would include a copy of my ID.  I was told that since I would not deal in good faith with them that again they would not pay off the balance of the Outback.

Now we had already received conformation on the payoff of the Outback to the bank.  What they needed was the title since they had already sold the Outback and needed the title.  The GM called me as short time later and we agreed that he would mail the documents that I needed to sign and I would send them back.  He made a statement about this being a training moment for his sales staff.  Unfortunately, the person making the hollow threat was the Sales Manager.  

Our experience had been good with them up to this point.  After this I will never set foot in any of Gillman's deal ships again. ",1.0

24,"May 06, 2014","I have been a Hyundai owner for almost 15 years. This time, I decided to buy a new Subaru at another dealership and had a terrible experience- they were pushy, aggressive, sneaky about pricing and available stock....the list goes on and on- everything we ALL hate about buying cars.  I was so unhappy with that purchase that I almost went and traded in my 2015 Subaru for a used Hyundai and was going to swear of Subaru as a brand all together when I met the Gillman team.  They are wonderful. Kind and patient, flexible and forthcoming. My salesman Mo should be promoted through Subaru to train ALL the salesmen on what REAL customer interaction should look like.  It was wonderful- I have never looked forward to returning to a dealership for maintenance but the people here are REAL people and friendly and they know they trade and products well and make it not only a survivable experience, but an enjoyable one as well.  I can not stop talking about my car, and my new go-to dealership!  I am a Subaru customer from now on, all thanks to the folks at Gillman.  It's true what the commercial says- Gillman... it's the (only) way to go!! Thank you SO SO SO much!!  If anyone is looking for a new car, do yourself a favor and don't buy ANYTHING until you talk to Mo at Gillman Subaru.  They are the best, and he is the best of the best! It will change all your preconceptions about car buying, I promise!!  ",5.0

27,"March 27, 2014","I went into the Gillman Subaru dealership shopping for a BRZ.  As soon as I walked into their lot i was greeted by Parker.  He is a very friendly sales rep and is not pushy at all.  By all means, he is not lazy, he is actually right on the ball with the paperwork/descriptions/process of purchases/and following up.

He made himself available and was there when I needed him.  He did not try to over-sell me anything that I dont need but he did made me aware of the additional options.  He looks into your eyes when he speaks which communicates to me that he is sincere and he is upfront.

From the minute I walked into the dealership and was greeted by him, I had bought a BRZ in about 25 hrs.  

Literally, Parker and his sales Manager Jon worked both really hard and got me a good deal on my trade in and then worked harder with the finance department and got me a great rate with my credit score.

Parker did not tell me to write this review but I am doing this to tell the public that Gillman Subaru, Jon, and Parker are definitely great to do business with.

I had a 2008 Evo X,  then a 2005 Evo 8, then another 2013 Evo X,  and after all that, with Parker's assistance, I now own a 2014 BRZ Limited with excellent package options.

goodjob Gillman Subaru.  

You guys all know that switching from a Mitsubishi Evo's to a Subaru is a big switch from opposite spectrum of competing sports cars.

Eric and Jennifer made were both extremely knowledgable and helpful.  No pushy sales people that don't know the cars they sell.  I got a good price without the negotiating hassle I was expecting.  I am definitely a satisfied customer.  Thanks again to Jennifer! Eric and the whole sales staff.,5.0
29,"December 23, 2013","One of the worst dealership and people I ever visited. They will lie and tells made up stories rather be transparent in their sales process. 
Facility is very small and smells like smoking zone.  
Salma khan showed us 2.5 TOURING Forester and claimed that its 2.5 limited. Her title says that she is internet sales specialist but never ever reply to emails. 
She told falsely that the car comes with tint and when locks fitted from factory. (its dealer installed items).
She will keep adding extras (dealer installed) items and will not reveal those while explaining the price. You need to ask all the times details on it. 
Being the internet sales specialist, she doesn't have any idea on the sepcails listed on their website. Inspite showing it, she coudnt explain the meaning of price match gurantee. 
She lied by saying that their is 2 years free maintainance offered by the dealer but in fact it is by Subaru and not by dealer. 
She promised that we will get CAR completely ready on the same day when we buy but after keep us waiting for almost 4 hrs she asked to come back next day. 
Next day: she showed some feedback form and asked us to get her 10 out of 10 on it. 
After receiving that feedback form, I gave details in the feedback and gave poor rating to her and overall sales experience. She immediately called me and my wife and left VM to call her back ASAP. 
After 4 weeks, when the car plates came to her, she didn't call to inform us but when I called her she started arguing that why did I give her that poor rating instead telling me the status on my plates. I told that if you want to discuss on the feedback..lets sit in front of your boss. So finally I went to the dealer ship collected my plates and met the boss who is GM for this dealership (Wally) and gave feedback. He told that she was used car sales person and just getting in to new car sales. 
My advise to all the customer: DONT DEAL WITH THIS DEALERSHIP AND SPECIALLY SALMA KHAN. Instead go to West Houston Subaru for 100 times much better experience and deals.

33,"August 27, 2012","I can't say enough good things about this dealership.  I just moved from Vermont to Houston and bought my very first car here.

After many months of research, I was all settled on a Scion, but when my dad and I went into Wally's office, he offered us a Subaru Impreza to drive until I got my own car so we wouldn't have to put more mileage on our rental van (which had already traveled 1800 miles from VT!).  Between the various amenities offered by Wally's dealership (like loaner cars if mine needs to go in the shop) and the safety features on the Impreza (AWD for when I get run off the highway for only driving 65 mph...), I ended up with a red Subaru Impreza!  I'm still a new driver, but the Impreza feels zippy and safe enough to keep me out of too much trouble.

Having gotten my driver's license 3 days before I arrived in Texas, I know nothing about cars, prices, or what I really need when it comes to driving.  I'd be the easiest target in the world for a salesman to take advantage of, and I fully expected to end up paying thousands more than necessary for whatever car I got since I don't know how to haggle.  Wally moved heaven and earth to get me the lowest price possible for the car, and his team took SUCH good care of me, explaining everything about warranties, financing, etc.  Wally promised me tinted windows, but won't tint them until I've had more practice and am a more confident driver.  I hadn't even thought of that, and don't know any other dealer (and I've been to a LOT doing car research) who would concern himself with my safety that way.  We didn't leave his dealership until about 10pm the day I signed all the paperwork, and one of the salesman personally picked me up and brought me home so I wouldn't have to drive out to the dealership at night by myself.  I can't explain how nice it feels to know I'm safe, with good people around me.

I would recommend this dealership to absolutely EVERYBODY in need of a new, used, or leased car.  ",5.0
34,"August 02, 2012","I can describe why I would recommend Gillman Subaru with one word, flexibility.  These guys bent over backwards to accomodate our requirements and schedule.  They listened to what we were telling them, a common skill which is quite uncommon these days, and worked to accomodate my schedule and earn our business.  I was so happy with every phase of our buying experience at Gillman lastSaturday that I went back on the following Tuesday to buy another Subaru!  They may have made me a Subaru customer for life, they'll certainly see me again.",5.0

Without a doubt my experience was the most stress free I have ever had. Brian P. in sales was absolutely wonderful. Extremely knowledgeable and always courteous, Brian went above and beyond my expectations in every facet of the sales experience. I worked with Tim in finance and he was thorough as well as funny.

The sale was as easy as a test drive and few follow-up emails to confirm the best price between Gillman and another dealer.  Brian in Sales made it a pleasant, low stress experience...no pressure and he went above and beyond what I asked for in terms of the lowest price.  Going in to sign paperwork with Woody the Finance Dept. manager was quick and easy.  Scheduling a time to take it in to Service for paint and fabric treatment was super smooth with Julio the Service Department manager.  He had the car in and out in no time flat.  Follow-ups by Gillman South to ensure my happiness and to offer a free detailing were icing on the cake.  Dealing with salesmen on a major purchase can sometimes be stressful especially when you are female but these guys treated me with the respect every customer deserves.  I'd recommend these guys to anyone in the market for a new Subaru.",5.0
38,"June 17, 2012","When I met with James for the first time, I hadn't decided whether to extend the expiring warranty on my car, buy a 2012 or wait a few weeks for the 2013's to come in, which trim level I wanted on the Outback, and which of the four car makes/models on my short list would win out. He was OK with all that and answered all my questions and sent me home with a brochure after a test drive. I really like the fact that Subaru has achieved no-landfill status at their U.S. plant, that they've set aside acreage there as a nature preserve, and that their cars have great safety scores. After test driving and eliminating the other cars, it was a comfortable negotiation for the Outback model I wanted, processing my financing application, and completing all the paperwork. Instead of handing me the car keys and sending me on my way, James went outside with me and explained all the features on the dashboard and throughout, and invited me to call if I had any questions. That was a first, and I have confidence that I'll be treated just as well by the service department.",4.8

The car we ended up purchasing was not available at the Gillman Southwest location and had to be delivered.  James and the manager worked very quickly to have one delivered to their location and we were kept informed of the status throughout the exchange.  

Based on experiences with other dealers, we were wary of the car-buying process.  The team at Gillman exceeded our expectations and we wouldn't hesitate to recommend them to others.  ",5.0

41,"April 11, 2012","Romeo is a gentleman and a pleasure to deal with.  James Rutledge (Internet Sales Mgr.) is, too.  I bought my first Outback from James in 1997 at Gay Pontiac.  I knew this would be a pleasant experience when I saw him walk out onto the sales floor.

I had shopped around, had offers, and James was perfectly willing to deal.  You never see this said about car dealers but:  It was a very pleasant experience.

I love Subarus; nothing has traction like a Subaru.  Living in Houston, where it rains (on average) every third day, traction is important.

This car is bigger and more luxurious than my '98.  It has a six, so it is much peppier, too.  The fit of the body is great (walk around a car and see if all corresponding panels have the same distance between them).

My only regret is that, despite the fact that Subaru builds cars to DRIVE, they offer no manual transmission with the six.  Oh well, it looks like we're still going to have fun.

From the very start he was timely and answered any and all questions I had.

When I came in to test drive a car James took the time to show off a Subaru Outback similar to what I was going to get and explain the car, the systems and the safety features to me.

He was also very good in offering up suggestions as to what options I might consider that were not originally on my list of option and then wrote the order up found that some of the options I wanted on the 2012 had become standard items.

It helped that I pretty much new what I wanted and the options but still having James explain things to me helped me to better understand the car and get all that I wanted.

Would definitely recommend James to others who might be looking for a Subaru!

95,"July 05, 2011","From the first contact through e-mail with Tim Jamerson I understood that he is a frank and reliable person who will do his best to make win-win situation. His patient explanations and friendly approach continued in the face to face meetting at delaership and all my questions were answered. He went even further offering to me to drive Honda CRV and deciding on final purchase. Then he made his best with sales manager to agree on the price which is fare for both parties. The day after, following my request he waited for me about 15 extra minutes after dealership closure on 4th July week-end so that I could drive out the car. And on 4th of July we met again so that he can explain to me the funcionalities of the car. So very well experience with Tim.  ",5.0
96,"June 27, 2011","I shopped several dealerships before making final decision to buy.  Tim spent a lot of time discussing vehicle with me.  First contact was made while I was still comparison shopping.  Tim was very informative and made me feel as though he valued me as a potential client.  After my first visit to Gilman, I also stopped at the Subaru Dealership in Katy and was totally insulted.  I specifically knew which options I wanted and options that I did not want and was not willing to pay for if they were on a vehicle.  Specifically, I did not want a moonroof - sales person made comment ""you can't afford the moonroof"".  I was throughly insulted and immediately made decision that i would never deal with that dealership.  I was also told at the other dealership that they needed my driver's license to put in their system before they would talk to me.  Unacceptable.  
Tim, on the other hand, was friendly, not pushy.  Answered my questions, listened to my reasons for the options I wanted - no high pressure sales tactics -- which is why i kept coming back and asking questions of Tim and was able to work out details for purchasing the vehicle.  
I look forward to long relationship with your dealership.",4.7

I was done with that car and lease. What a relief that was. There was never a moment of apprehension.

I was quite nervous about trying a new auto brand but your Internet Sales Manager Mr. James Rutledge spent a lot of time explaining the product to me and I left your company feeling very happy and at ease about my new purchase. I contacted several dealers both here in Houston as well as in Cheyenne and I finally decided to buy my new vehicle from your company since I couldn't find the same level of excellent customer service or great deal offered to me by Mr. Rutledge anywhere else. My father came along with me when I went to pick up the new car and he was very impressed by Mr. Rutledge as well. We have bought several new cars from other dealers in Houston and we have never had a sales representative who spent as much time with us as Mr. Rutledge did.

They only gave me $2,000 trade in on my Baja and a few days later I regretted letting it go.  It was in very good condition well maintained over the years had new tires, new headlight assemblies and a new alternator.  I asked the general manager if I could buy it back for what they gave me for it ($2,000) and he agreed.  Then, when I went in to complete the deal he wouldn't talk to me and made the salesman I bought the Forester from tell me they couldn't sell it to me for less than %5,300.  So the general manager's word isn't worth anything.

Both Mr. James Rutledge and Mr. Darrin Jackson were extremely helpful. Mr. 
Rutledge took the time to ask questions about our needs and more importantly 
listened to our answers. Ultimately, I believe he gave us a great price on a 
2011 Forester when we expected to buy a 2010.  

Mr. Jackson got us a much better financing rate than our credit union had given 
us (whom, by the way, we have been with for twenty years). By our estimate, Mr. 
Jackson saved us $1200 in interest. 

Finally, I expected to leave the showroom with the vague feeling that I had 
been scammed, but I left extremely happy with the car, the deal and the 
financing. 

I look forward to working with Gillman Subaru throughout the life of this car 
and maybe another one or two in the future.

120,"November 23, 2010","- I was shopping around for a while, used Carwoo to check the prices, SW Gillman Subaru came close with West Houston Subaru. I have top connection in Sterling, but they do not have Subaru in Houston and their Boston price could not come close.
- I was a cash buyer, so the price was the main target for me.
- The reason I bought the car from James:
- NO Pressure
- Knowledge
- Just simple good attitude.

That the reason that influenced my final decision.
He was the best communication to me via mail, unless other dealers.


So If You want to buy Subaru, with no pressure, good price - James is the person to talk.

PS. I bought 2011 Outback 2.5i Manual. I was shocked finding out that most dealers do not have manual in stock, offering used instead, that's how I turned Honda and Hyundai down from my list.

129,"October 05, 2010","I originally submitted a request to purchase a 2011 WRX a while back over the internet. I heard back from James who said I could order the car via a $500 deposit, which I did. Well, over the months it took for the car to be built and ultimately delivered, James was extremely professional and courteous via the emails despite several threats to drop the deposit and shop elsewhere. I was a bit anxious and definitely impatient and he handled it very well. On the day of delivery this changed and he was very rude (JUST KIDDING!) He was just as I expected, friendly and courteous and he seemed to know quite a bit about the cars which is always a plus. We cut straight to the chase and a good deal that benefited both of us was worked out. On to the paperwork, we met DJ Jackson who was awesome. He was able to put my father at ease (very hard to do lol) concerning the sale of the car and he even gave us a hot tip on a good place to eat, make sure to get the heads up on this!

130,"October 01, 2010","My experience at Gillman Subaru in Houston, TX was excellent!  I can't think of anything that would have made my experience any better.  Tim Jamerson and D.J. (the Office Manager) were just terrific.  I flew down from Dallas and drove my new car back home.  My husband was away on business that day so could not give me any support by phone.  But, Tim gave me directional guidance several times when I thought I was lost trying to get out of Houston!  I love Gillman Subaru and will buy my new Foresters from them from now on!

Prior, my husband sent an email to several dealerships here in Texas with the specs for a new Forester.  Tim was the only one who responded and did so in no time at all and worked a great deal for us in a matter of minutes.  I was very specific about the minimum options I would accept and my husband knew I would not settle for anything less.  When Tim emailed the information back to my husband, he was thoughtful enough to include a picture of the window sticker!  Who does that?? I thought, ""if this guy is smart enough to give us the window sticker information, then he's getting my business."" Turns out, it was a much better deal than we ever expected and the car had more options than I even asked for! I knew then that I had to do business with these people!

Tim never played around with price or going back and forth getting approval from a manager - no silly pricing games which we both are old enough to really hate when buying a car!  Actually, this is what lead us to Gillman because a dealer closer to home played that scenario with us and we ended up walking out of the dealership!

I've gone on and on, but my testimonial about Gillman Subaru and Tim Jamerson are very sincere.  When I feel strongly about a great experience, I want everyone to know.  These folks are above and beyond the norm.  They cut to the chase, don't mess around, and even give you directions on how to get out of Houston, TX - for free!

Tim has since answered several of my questions about my new car and I continually depend on him to support me even from so far away - something he's never hesitated to do.  The Gillman dealership in Houston, Texas deserves the highest of honors for the quality employees they have and the genuine honesty in which they do business.  Their standards are extremely high - and it shows!

136,"September 04, 2010","In the three weeks before I visited Gillman Subaru, I visited quite a few other dealerships in the Houston area:  Hyundai, Kia, Honda, Nissan, and Ford, to be exact, looking for a small to medium SUV. The Honda dealerships wanted to add on bogus charges, wanted me to sign a ""commitment to buy"" document before they'd give me a price. One Hyundai saleswoman was very nice, low-key, offered a fairly reasonable price,made a good inpression.  But the salesman at Ron Carter Hyundai left me standing in 100º weather by a locked car in the parking lot while he went to talk to a couple who had just wandered onto the lot.  McRee Ford in Dickinson: salespeople couldn't be bothered to stand up and ask me how they could help me.  Baytown Kia was nice, just couldn't meet my price when I knew they could, if they wanted. Two other Kia dealers tried to start very high and work down, knocking off an additional $500. to a thousand as I started out the door. This only tells me that if I hadn't stood up and walked toward the door, I would have paid a lot more for the vehicle. Not acceptable. Nissan was too busy to talk seriously with me. Gillman Subaru was the last on the list; I'd pretty much decided to keep my old vehicle before I went there. What a nice surprise! I was treated with courtesy and respect by everyone I came in contact with. They immediately came down to the Consumer Reports ""Bottom Line"" price, no hassles, no bogus charges, no games.  After three weeks of other dealers, it was such a welcome change! In two follow-up situations, I was treated with the same courtesy and respect.  All questions were answered, everything was taken care of in a timely manner.  There is intelligent life at Gillman Subaru, folks!  I'd begun to despair!  I highly recommend this dealership!
