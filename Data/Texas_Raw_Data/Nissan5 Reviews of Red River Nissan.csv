0,"August 24, 2018","I purchased a 2015 Nissan Versa with 65 miles on it. It now has 54,000 in that amount of time I have had to have 2 transmission replaced. The 2nd time the alignment was off when I picked up my vehicle and the refused to listen to me. They said it was due to my tires needing to be replaced. My tires did need to be replaced yes but the vehicle was not pulling hard to the right when I brought it in and it was after I picked it up! So I was forced to have the alignment adjusted out of my own pocket. Now my CV joints are going out and I am told they ""just need to tighten up my front end"" which is ridiculous! I pick up my car with the same issue it has (knocking noises when you turn and accelerate). Also I have bolts missing on my front end now and a random plastic peice off my front end they decided to toss in my trunk (did they think I wouldn't notice!?) Lucily my husband is a mechanic and the issue will be resolved. I have been treated like I know nothing and I am a nuisance! I will NEVER purchase another vehicle from Nissan!",1.8
1,"June 16, 2017",Thank you. Greatest service. Got me in and out fast. Did over and above expectations. My wife loves her Murano. She hasn't ever been happier but a car or service done to it. Thank you again. ,5.0
2,"October 12, 2013",I liked how I was treated.  I got a Nissan from there and I love it.  They were so nice about everything and got me financed quickly and without any headaches. I usually hate car shopping but this one I had fun.  I bought a 13 Altima. ,5.0
3,"July 09, 2013",I recently purchased a new Nissan pathfinder from Red River Nissan and I was extremely please as before.  I originally bought my 06 pathfinder from Ellie back when he was a salesman and I was very satisfied.  I was glad to see he got moved up and is now the store manager.  I've always been treated right every time I go there.  I highly recommend Nissan and Red River and I'm glad Ellie is now the store manager. ,5.0
4,"June 07, 2012","I leased a car from Red River Nissan about two months ago. When negotiating the deal I requested the maintenance plan I had with my previous lease (Honda) because I move quite a bit. I was assured that I was getting the ""same"" maintenance plan as my previous lease as well as I was having leather installed in the Altima. I was concerned with them putting extra miles on the car to drive it to get the leather installed, I was promised by my salesman that they would be shipping it on a truck so milage was not an issue. When I went to pick up the car I noticed the exccess miles that were put on it and asked if it had been shipped. I was told that they must have driven it but they would make it up to me by extending my maintenance program to the full lease term. So I recently went to get my first maintenance service and was informed that I do not have a maintenance plan on my car. They were kind enough to go ahead with my free maintenance and instructed me that all leased Nissans have free maintenance for the lease term, and that I needed to contact Red River and make sure they put it in the system. I contacted my salesman direct, who then informed me that my plan was only for that dealership, even though I have text messages proving that he said it would have the ""same maintenance plan as my honda"". After an hour of back and forth messageing and a horrible attitude from the saleman I demanded that the finance manager call me. He also denied that I had the plan. I unfortunatley did not read my lease word for word as I should have or I would have seen that they had not included the maintenance plan as they promised. Moral of the story DO NOT TRUST Red River Nissan. They made promises (in writing via text message) and screwed me out of my maintenance plan. I wouldnt reccommend anyone deal with them. Your better off driving into Dallas and at least there you get a better selection.",1.5
