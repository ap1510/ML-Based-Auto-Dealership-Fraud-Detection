DO NOT FALL FOR THE LIES THEY SAY JUST TO TAKE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY! They are not honest and as soon as you drive off with what you believe is a descent car, it breaks down! It's a clunker! When you try taking it back to get repaired, they want to blame everything else around them, taking absolutely ZERO responsibility, and they still ask for more money!! Horrible service! Will NEVER EVER go back to this crooked dealership again! Be smart, STAY AS FAR AWAY AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN FROM THIS PLACE!",1.0
1,"September 22, 2019","I bought a Subaru from Gillman in 2004.  I am 56 years old and have owned a lot of cars in my lifetime.   That Subaru has had more recalls in the 5 years than any other car I have ever owned.  In addition, it seems to me that every time I brought my Subaru in for a repair other stuff would need to be fixed.  In fact, in August I brought the thing in 3 times and spent over $800 getting stuff fixed that were not on the recall.  In fact, after my first visit in August I wasn't even 30 minutes out of the repair shop and the stupid warning light was back on.  And the next day another warning light came on.  That was the case for each of the three times I was in your Subaru service center this August.  In fact, now not only is the same warning light on the check engine light is on too.  This is after I asked y'all to change the oil during my second visit in August.  Plus I paid to have the air conditioning fixed during my first visit.  The air conditioning stopped working 2 weeks after having that repaired.  Fool me once, your bad, fool me twice...   Three strikes and Gillman is out for the rest of my life!  If y'all offered me a car for $100 I wouldn't take it because I know that y'all are planning to make it up in recalls and car repair fees.",2.0
2,"May 16, 2019","Crooked sales people who will lie to your face, take your money and sell you a piece of junk! They clean it to look nice and shiny on the outside, but is a complete piece of junk under the hood where it's most important! Will never go back to this place. I will never refer anyone that is human with a heartbeat to this dealership. ",1.0
3,"September 27, 2018","After a two week text and voice conversation agreed on a price on a used vehicle at Gillman Subura. I live out of state.  Everything agreed on changed once I arrived. After stalling and making excuses for an hour and 45 minutes and me walking out to wait on my Uber, the salesman finally took me back to the Finance Manager.  Finance manager treated me like I was some kind of criminal, very irate and angry.  Salesman and finance manger kept saying my Cashiers Check has a lien against it? Then the title would have a lien!? Then she stated she was told this was going to be a cash deal?  Why would this matter?   Doesn’t just about every vehicle on the road have a lien against the title?    I took a cashiers check from my bank to pay for the vehicle and had arranged to pay my taxes in my home state.  Still really not sure why they wouldn’t sell me the car. Very strange ordeal.  Wasted a day off work, airfare and had to rent a car to drive the 500 miles home.  Definitely would not recommend Gillmam Subura to anyone. Very shady operation.  Never experienced anything like this. ",1.6
4,"August 30, 2018",Bought a used car from them.  I was told it was inspected and working great with no issues.  Come to find out a couple of days later the car had an oil leak.  Took it to them and was told it was a class 2 head gasket failure and needed to pay them 2500$ to get it fixed.  Now the transmission is going out on it.  I would not expect this from a big dealership like this.  ,1.4
5,"August 24, 2018","While my sales person Albert provided me excellent service I felt the appraiser/manager who dictated the offers for my trade in was trying to rip me off, offering me insultingly low offers claiming my car had almost no market value at all, while Northpark offered me 3x what they would and my car was appraised for 4.5x at CarMax what gillman was attempting to offer me. I just can’t give my business to a dealership that tries so obviously to rip me off, makes me feel like I can’t trust thru the purchasing process let alone trust them once I leave the lot with a car. Again, excellent service by the sales person, but can’t make up for the insultingly low trade in offer.",1.0
6,"August 03, 2018","Less than a month of buying a used car, the front passenger window doesn't go up. I asked the dealer for assistance only to be denied. Not to forget that the tires weren't aligned or balanced. This is just another dealer that makes false  promises. ",1.4
7,"October 13, 2016","On my drive home from work, my vehicle started having problems (overheating).  My husband was out of town, so I called Gillman Service Department (we had just had the vehicle there that past weekend for an oil change and at the time, I didn't know who else to call or what was wrong with the car [we just moved here recently]).  Sales Rep/Technician Jay came to my rescue to look at my car for me and even followed me home to make sure I got home safely.  While I did have to have the car towed into the service department that night (radiator issue), the fact that he went out of his way to help me spoke volumes on how they value their customers!  Truly thankful for their help!",4.8
8,"September 23, 2016","We dropped off our Outback to have the airbag replaced under the recall on a Thursday night so we could pick it up after work the next day.  They said it would take two hours.  When we called on Friday at 3, they said it wasn't done and that it takes 10 hrs.  I don't think so!  2.5 hrs later they said it was done so we went to get it.

Upon inspection, the previously immaculate dash now has large gashes in it in more than one place,  and just like previous reviewers have said, they tried to sneak it past.  No one pointed out their damage or mentioned what they were going to do about it.  My wife had to confront them.  And, by the way, the dash feels funny now.  I mean squishy and rubbery.  I'm not even certain it's the same dash the car went in with anymore but I could never prove that.  But it sure did undergo a strangle transformation over night.

After we pointed out the sticky, rubbery feel and the gouges....well NOW they say there's a recall on sticky dashes and they're ordering a new one that will take 6 months to get here.  No mention of that BEFORE we pointed out the damage they did.

I have several Subaru owner friends that have all said the same thing about the Gilman service department......they won't let them touch their car.  Add one more to that list.

Follow up.
The wife went in the next day and talked to the service manager about our concerns.  He apologized, had the car cleaned and located a new dash in Dallas to have sent here so we have a new dash in a week instead of 6 months.  So they're attempting to make it right and I'll give them credit for that.  I'm still not happy with how things were handled upon front or with the quality of the work done the first time.  

Final words:  So, we now have the car back after the put in the new dash.  My wife is more than happy.  They gave her a loaner, detailed/washed the car and filled up the tank to boot.  So, in the end, they resolved the issue in an exemplary manner.  I do want to say that I'm still very unhappy that we had to jump through the hoops the get the results we got; they should never have tried to pass off the terrible job they did in the first place.  So I'm leaving my original ratings the same based on that.  But it appears that if you complain to them about terrible work, they'll do what they can to fix it.",2.4

10,"May 27, 2015","Just experienced the WORST OF THE WORST BS that is Gillman Subaru at it's finest. Wanted to buy a new 2015 BRZ LIMITED that turned out to be a Dealer car with a few hundred miles & possibly some new wheels. FIRST and foremost, they wanted approximately $3500 over the MSRP in which NO ONE should ever consider paying MSRP Sticker price. I found out the car was INVOICED @ approximately $ 27,500, WTH Gillman Subaru? I highly recommend that EVERYONE AND ANYONE that would consider doing new business with Gillman Subaru or ANY other dealer, ask for the INVOICE BEFORE any consideration, IF they DO NOT PRODUCE an actual INVOICE, PLEASE stand up & walk out. Gillman Subaru seems to produce an imaginary INFLATED price without producing an AUTO INVOICE to see clearly what the dealers cost to buy that specific auto.

** So to make it easy for anyone thinking about a NEW auto purchase**

!!!!!!DO THE FOLLOWING & ASK FOR THE DEALERS INVOICE  TO VERIFY THE ACTUAL PRICE PLUS OPTIONS!!!!!!!!

*** If Gillman Subaru is unwilling to produce an actual dealer INVOICE, you DO NOT know what kinda INFLATED PRICES Gillman Subaru is definitely offering you, know your rights CONSUMERS!!!!!

I GIVE GILLMAN SUBARU NO STARS for poor customer service, huge INFLATED prices & let's no forget the DEEP BS at its FINEST they throw at you, the ""uneducated"" consumer.. 

**** REMEMBER TO ASK FOR DEALER INVOICE BEFORE ANY TALK, LOOK IT OVER, SEARCH FOR 2 columns,***

** MSRP**  >>> Don't even think about paying that price!!!!!!!!!
** Dealer Costs*  Is ALWAYS lower than *MSRP* !!! 

I highly recommend any San Antonio based Subaru dealers for HONEST rates that will produce a real paper INVOICE, 
You don't have to travel to Selma for an awesome deal, unless you want to pay INFLATED PRICES & consider yourself a MORON because Gillman Subaru expects you to bow to them without producing actual,true INVOICE.

Rodney L.
( Highly recommend North Park Subaru on San Pedro Street. for HONEST INVOICE pricing , Awesome Customer service , shoot you straight answers to your questions and let's Not forget, Awesome & Kind people with Positive attitudes and results. Ask for Albert Rocha,a polite,respectful gentleman with real answers the best customer service a consumer can and will receive from North Park Subaru. Remember, they are a few dealers apart from GILLMAN SUBARU in SAN ANTONIO that will respect the consumer without trying to EXTORT money from UNEDUCATED consumers, which any cusumer that walks in to any Gillman Dealers lot will acquire even before you open your eyes and ears to hear the HUGE BS greeting your person.

** Know your rights CONSUMERS! Ask for dealers INVOICE!! NO ACTUAL INVOICE, WALK AWAY & RUN! 

** Had to give 1 Star because it would not let me Submit my experience without one.
** Negative Stars sounds about right for Gillman Subaru and/or any Gillman organization**

11,"April 05, 2015",We recently purchased a 2015 Subaru Forester from Gillman Subaru. Everything about the experience was easy and stress free. There was no haggling over the price and we were offered a deal that was exactly in the price range we were looking for. They even delivered the car to us when we were unable to get back to pick it up. I would highly recommend this dealership for your next car buying experience. ,5.0
12,"April 22, 2014","A couple of months ago I took our '12 Outback in for an oil change.  The service writer tried to tell me I had to have synthetic oil, a plain contradiction of the owners' manual.  I didn't buy it.  Fast forward to this week with another oil change due and a minor concern about a possible CV joint noise.  My wife called, the service writer told her we weren't using synthetic motor oil - implying that was the problem.  I got on the line and he told me that, plus there would be a $115 diagnosis fee on a vehicle still under factory warranties!  I made an appointment I had no intention of keeping, and I went to North Park Subaru instead, where I was treated honestly and courteously (with no profit-pumping synthetic oil recommendation).  DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THESE CROOKS AT GILLMAN!  They also show all the signs of a mechanic taking particular advantage of female customers.",1.4
13,"November 18, 2013",Awesome Sales Rep Josh was very knowledgable about all Subaru options.  He took the time to understand my needs and worked to help me get in the best vehicle for me!!! At the end of the day I am a proud owner of a beautiful red XV Crosstrek! Thank you Josh for such a great car buying experience. ,5.0
14,"November 13, 2013","Had a great experience buying my 2014 WRX. I worked with Anthony to purchase and I felt I got a great deal. I shopped around for a few weeks and I received more attentive service and a better deal at Gillman Subaru than what North Park offered.

15,"October 05, 2013","I recently traded in my 2011 Chevy Cruze for a Jeep Liberty. The process was quick and easy. My sales rep Steve S. Stayed in contact before I met him and was a big help, he showed me the car I was looking for and also got me a good deal for my trade in. He was also very informative of the trade in and finance process. He and the finance manager Nick S. helped me to stay within my budget for car payments and worked hard to get it as low as possible. They also allowed me and my husband to take the car home overnight to make sure we liked it and we loved it! Usually I don't feel comfortable with car salesmen because of the fear of being ripped off but these guys were a great help and I have already recommended them. My husband is also looking to trade in his vehicle, so we will definitely be back. If you're looking into getting a new car, visit Gillman Mitsubishi. Steve and Nick can definitely help you out!

17,"September 23, 2013","As I promissed, here is my review regarding the service for oil change last friday.  Again, not sure why people complain so much, I'm sure everyone's experience is different, however, I went there to get the oil changed, they told me it will take about 45 minutes...45 minutes later the car was ready, so i didnt have to wait more than estimated.  It's a new car so I didnt pay anything, I get 2 free oil changes per year and free car wash, so great price.",5.0
18,"September 20, 2013","Went there to buy a brand new Impreza WRX, bought it, and I am completly satisfied.
Now, for those individuals who keep complaining about the prices especially and the fact that they went there (or any other dealership for that matter), and didnt get what they wanted or what they expected, here are a few words for you.  Please open your eyes and don't be naive, it is a dealership, thus a business, their main goal is to take your money.  Of course they are not going to offer you what you want on your trade, of course they are going to give you a big price on a car, of course they are going to try and fluff up your monthly payment, they need your money.  This is just common sence and I don't believe they are accurate reviews of what a delearship offers.  For example, like I said in the begining, I wanted a 2013 Impreza WRX, I went there, and I got it...yes for a bit higher price than I expected, but, I was completly honest with them, I told them for me what matters is the monthly payment, and that I didnt care about the actual price nor the interest rate.  You know what happen then?  Mike and the finance guy whose name I forgot, did what they did, and I got the car for about $100 less a month than I expected, and an insanely low interest rate considering I am farily new to America and my credit is not yet built.  I will share it with you, so my previous car I got a 23% interest rate, on this new WRX i got 3.8%, I would say that is a major success, and why?  Because I was honest and didnt waste their time of haggling with them or complaining.  I told them what I was there for and they gave me a better deal than expected.  And yes, for my trade they underpaid almost $1000, but that car needed major repairs, and I believe overall it was a great experience.  Today I am going for my 3,000 mile oil change, and we will see how that goes.  I have seen bad reviews on the technical department, so after my experience I will share it again here.",4.5
19,"August 27, 2013","Me and my fiancé went to Gillman Subaru to purchase a 2009 Subaru STI. We were wanting to trade in our 2013 Jeep Wrangler Rubicon, we knew going in we were going to roll over some negative equity, but we were prepared for it and saving to purchase our first home. The new care payments and just saving in gas would really help us a lot. Customer service was alright, the sales rep was a really honest young boy and polite. Right off the back the rep advised us that they had sent the vehicle to auction and that it was aggressively priced. This was not our first rodeo and could tell that this used vehicle asking price was way too high for the kind of condition it was in, plus my fiance could do all the repairs needed. Everything was going okay till the bid for our traded in vehicle. Our vehicle s highest bid was 30K. The sales rep had advised us that CarMax is a really good company that would give us the most for the vehicle and that they would purchase the vehicle at CarMax s appraisal then sale to CarMax and would still be able to roll over the little negative equity we would incur. WRONG!!!! We both used out lunch hour from work the following day to go all the way to CarMax on the other side of town. The appraisal was a lot higher and we were pleased. But when we reached out to the sales rep to let him know what we got for it, he said he needed to talk it over with his manager and discuss it with him. He then called back stating that his manager told him they did not do that anymore. When asked then what was the point of even having that done, he had no answer and mumbled the whole time. That option should have never been offered since it would take us no where. All employees should be on the same page and if an approval needs to be made, it should be made prior to potential customers wasting their time. Very unpleased with the experienced provided by this dealership and it was a complete waste of our time. Not to mention their lack of honest when it comes to the pricing of vehicles they are just trying to get rid of.They made an exciting new purchase and overall lifted burden come out to be a complete inconsiderate slap in the face.

20,"April 14, 2013","What a horrible, frustrating, awful experience! I would never buy from this place. Our sales consultant Brian was not necessarily the worst  but he didn't do much in the way of explaining the features of the Forester  we were interested in. I think it was because he just isn't all that knowledgeable about them. We told him we would like to see what kind of a deal we could work out and he took us inside. He had an assessment done on my current vehicle and the trade-in value he came back with was $1500 less than I had been getting at other dealerships. He made it seem that no one was going to be interested in my vehicle and that it was more of a loss to them than anything. Slightly insulting. The estimates for the vehicle I wanted to purchase came to about $475 a month for 60 months on a forester with a msrp of $27200. $475 X60 = $28500. If you add in the $5000 trade in value, I would be paying all together $33500 for a $27200 msrp vehicle. I told him that with our great credit we shouldn't have a payment more that $400 and those numbers he had calculated were way off from where we needed to be. He went off to work it out with his ""manager"" and that's when things got ugly. I consider myself a fairly nice, polite person and I have also worked in sales for many years. I was absolutely appealed by the ""selling"" techniques of this so called ""manager"" LLoyd. He began by telling us there was no possible way to get it down to $400 and that ""most of our customers are generally more affluent. If you cant pay more than $400 a month than you shouldn't even be looking to buy a new car."" He asked several times what it would take for us to buy one that day and my husband made it very clear that we would not be purchasing the vehicle that day. He said then it would be a waste of his time to even try to get us a lower number. After a few more insults he left us to think about it. He came back less than 3 minutes later and said that he was able to squeeze a one time only deal in for $400/60mnths but only if we bought it right then and there. We got up and walked out. Lloyd is the worst, most arrogant, full of himself sales associate I have ever met and would never do business with him. Side note, he introduced himself as a manager but his business card says sales/ leasing consultant. They are running a real shady business and I would recommend anyone considering to purchase from there to really do your homework and not get pressured into anything by these yahoo's. ",1.0
21,"January 28, 2013","I have had all maintainance done with Gillman Subaru for my 2010 Forester.  Last time I went in, I asked to have battery checked because it was starting to crank harder to start car. (No dead battery yet)  I wanted to avoid having to get jumped.

I was told that I was 150 miles over the warranty for a free battery replacement and was being charged $250.00 for the replacement.  I had car in two months prior for oil change at 34,000 and had car checked and was told all was great!  Now battery needs replacement.

Dealer brought price down to $140 for battery but I was shocked that they would not replace for free as I have been a loyal customer for 3 years now - especially since milage was so close to warranty limit.",3.2
22,"January 28, 2013","Always go to Gillman for service for 2010 forester.  Went in to have oil change and have battery checked at 36150 miles.  Battery was starting to crank harder and I wanted to avoid having to be jumped.

Was told that I was 150 miles over warranty for FREE new battery and charge was $250.00. Told service that I would not pay that and after awhile brought price down to $142.00.

I felt that some type of allowance should have been made about the free battery and the warranty.  Iwas 150 miles over limit!!  I had car in two months prior at 33,000 miles for service and spent $500.00 for service that was due, and was told everything was fine.  Now I get hooked for a replacement battery.

23,"May 26, 2012","To keep the Gillman warranty you have to have your oil changed at the dealer every 3,000 miles and/or every 3 months. I made a an appointment for an oil change. When I dropped it off I was told I would have the vehicle soon. I have been sitting here for hours, yes, hours now. The wait for an oil change when you have made an appointment a week in advance should not be hours long. This has reached the point of absurdity. While here....for hours...I have seen the staff speak poorly to other customers. I have watched a car sit in front of service for an hour with the repairs being made before a customer was alerted that her car was ready...and that was only because I personally asked if that car was ready to go. Hideous staff & poor service. At this rate, my car better be fully detailed when I get it back.",1.0
24,"May 04, 2012","My son and I went to this dealership specifically to look at a used Tiburon they had. We got to the dealership, they got the keys right out for us and we took the vehicle on a test drive. Before we even finished the test drive my son decided this was the vehicle he wanted. We told the salesman and he took us inside to work out the deal. They took my Mustang which we were trading in to get appraised and he had us fill out credit applications (I was cosigning). For anyone who doesn't know, EVERY time someone runs your credit it lowers your overall credit score, therefore I never randomly have my credit run. We were doing it simply to purchase the Tiburon. Our salesman came in and out telling us things were looking good and they were just trying to find us a the best deal. After awhile he finally came back in and told us the good news...we were approved and they could get us in a car. The bad news was the car we applied for was sold to the person who test drove it after us. Seriously?? How can a dealership run your credit to purchase a vehicle that they are selling to someone else?? If we had known the car was going to be sold to another customer, I would have NEVER agreed to have my credit run. We did not want any random car at their dealership, we wanted the car we came in specifically to look at. Now my credit score will be lower and we still have to find a vehicle for my son! That is simply bad business. To top it off, our sales associate told us his manager wanted to speak to us, so we waited and waited. We still didn't have the keys back to the mustang, so we couldn't leave. Finally I was not going to wait any longer. I went in the office and demanded the keys. I said this was completely unprofessional and I was appalled at their business practices. Worst non-car buying experience ever. Side note, Greg, our sales associate was a nice kid. He tried his best, it was the on duty manager who knew about the other person buying the car. He also knew that I had come in to look at the car and that we were doing a credit check to purchase the car. He should have stopped it before it got to that point if he knew someone else was purchasing the vehicle. I didn't put his name in because he never bothered to even come in and explain the situation, so I have no idea who he is. ",1.0
25,"February 18, 2012",We chose to shop at Gillman Mitsubishi based on the vehicles we had found online.  I had communicated with Michael Beeler via email for almost a month.  While Mr. Beeler was very kind he was not well versed in the products or services of the dealership and I felt as though he ignored or forgot to take care of things we had talked about.  The finance supervisor however saved the entire experience.  He was very easy to talk to and took time to explain in detail everything while at the same time working hard to keep things moving so we could finish in a timely manner.  Without his expertise I would not have purchased there and I would not have given such positive feedback.,4.4

28,"January 15, 2012","Kevin was my first contact at Subaru; I was looking at the new Legacy.  Then I told Kevin I am very pleased with the performance of my last 3 Honda Accords and it is hard for me to go with something I am not familiar with having such good success with Honda's.  Kevin took me next door to your Honda Dealership and I was introduced to Nick.  Nick (young man with a pony tail, I only say this because I know there are more than one Nick in that department) was just a pleasure to work with.  I let them both know I was not going to buy today and they respected that.  Both Kevin and Nick kept in touch with me letting me know they want my business and both tried hard to convenience me to buy in a respectful way not criticizing one car over the other but reassuring me either car would be a great choice.

I finally decided to stay with a Honda.  Two reason really, my success with the vehicle and the trunk space (i.e. trunk opening is larger in the Honda).  That is what swayed me.  Thank you for your service, I am very pleased with the vehicle.

Within a matter of minutes he called me and answered any questions I had. Days later, I flew from Missouri to San Antonio to pick up the SUV. Lloyd picked me up at the airport and drove me to the dealership to complete the paperwork. Don in finance was very courteous and helpful.

Diagnostic came back catalytic converter so Tim waived the normal $90 charge since it didn't impede driving and we could order and get the part repaired at our normal local dealer.

Brice, our porter, drove my wife and me to a nearby shopping mall to help us pass the time.  Brice has real knack for customer service and impressed us with his interest in our lifestyle as full time RVers. He engaged us in conversation on a personal level.  Something most young men his age would never do.  He is also an excellent and attentive driver.  I was truly impressed with this young man.  Ruben, the service tech took very good care of our car.  The parts guys, sorry I didn't get their names helped me resolve a missing front license plate bracket issue.  They were great and with Tim and Ruben's help made sure we left the dealership with a proper fitting and secure front plate.  It felt like home dealing with this team of professionals.",4.8

Tom was the best tech I have ever had at a car dealership.  Never before have I had a tech willing to take me to see my car as he worked on it, and explain exactly what he was doing and what was wrong with the car.  

Hunter made the 3 day long experience a good one.  He was friendly, knowledgeable and extremely helpful.  At times he was literally running from office to office trying to get my paperwork done so I could start the long drive back to Corpus Christi.  He constantly kept me updated on the status of my car which means a lot when waiting for your car to be diagnosed / fixed.  Hunter made what would have been a very painful 3 day ordeal into a pleasant experience.

First there was some confusion between the sales department and service department regarding what paperwork I was required to have with me to get accessories installed and regarding availability of a loaner vehicle. After implying that they couldn't do any installation work without the ""We Owe"" document and thinking I would have to travel back across town to get this from my home, they finally said that they should be able to get it from the salesman when he arrived later in the day.  I also mentioned to the Service rep that I received a call to let me know that my plates had arrived and while I would have expected him to say that they would take care of putting the plates on my car, he instead told me that I would have to get them from the person that called me without any suggestion that they could take care of this or explanation of why he could not do this for me.

Tim was more then happy to sit and speak with me about the vehicle even though I am not ready to pick one up just yet.  I walked out of the dealership with all the information I need and a couple of invites to play Call of Duty on Xbox.  Not only will I recommend Subaru to all my friends I will recommend that they buy it from Tim.  I will definitely be back in October to order a new WRX.,5.0
94,"September 02, 2010","We had had a very bad experience at 3 other dealers, but Fernando and Tim gave us exceptional service.  They were knowledgeable and helpful---never pushy.  They went on a hunt for the right car for us and the right price.  We were very happy with the service they gave us and would definitely recommend them and this dealership to others.  The car is exceptional---we did our research before coming in and weren't disappointed in the quality.  It is fun to drive!  Thanks, Tim and Fernando!  We are happy customers. You do a great job making customers feel at ease and earned our trust with your honest and sincere concern regarding the finding of the right car for us.",5.0
95,"September 01, 2010","To start off with, Tim is not the ""typical"" pushy salesman. He is direct and down to earth. I already knew exactly what I wanted before ever stepping foot in any dealership which helped on my behalf. Tim was very professional and if there was something he did not know, quick to point you in the right direction. He will go out of his way to ensure that his customer is taken care of. I would recommend purchasing a Subaru from him any day and if you are not fully satisfied with him not knowing every technical aspect of a vehicle, then research it some yourself. Do you really want to go to any dealership and expect to rely on what the salesman tells you? That should be the standard for any major purchase. I have experienced salesmen that will tell you whatever you want to hear to make a deal. Immediately (not even 10 minutes into conversation) Tim informed me of all my different options and what he thought would be in my best interest. Bottom line, I will probably purchase my next vehicle at Gillman as well if Tim is still around. ",5.0
96,"August 28, 2010","The salesman, Tim Gartner, was excellent. We already knew that we wanted a Subaru Forester, so it was just a question of: (a) would we buy the old model or wait for the new one to come out, and (b) which dealership would we use (we were considering going to Austin where the options looked better than in San Antonio). We had bought our first Forester from North Park in 1998 and had been VERY dissatisfied with their sales person (who is no longer there, so we would have gone to that dealership while shopping, despite that bad experience more than 10 years ago). 

Tim got our business by replying to my husband's query (via Edmunds.com) very promptly - so promptly that we came to the showroom immediately after my husband's plane landed that same day. He gave us excellent information about car features and other factors that we needed to consider. We were satisfied in every way with his helpfulness and straightforwardness. That - more than anything else about our experience in buying this new car - is the reason we would recommend this dealership.",4.5
