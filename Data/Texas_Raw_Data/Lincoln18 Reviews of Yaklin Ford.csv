1,"May 14, 2020",Had a great buying experience. Looking forward to driving my new truck!! Joseph worked hard to get me ex’s what I wanted. Thank you!!,5.0
2,"March 05, 2020","Worst customer service, EVER. It’s been over a year since we purchased our vehicle through them (Dec 2018) and we still have not received keys to our vehicle or other essential items we were promised over and over we would receive. They know I’m active duty stationed on the other side of the country so I can’t just show up there to demand them to do their job and they take advantage of that. Nice to see how they treat service members, huh? Staff is lazy and they’re liars. Steer clear from salesman Joseph or you will more than likely share the same negative experience. Don’t waste your time here.",1.0
3,"November 03, 2019","They keep money from your paycheck. Warranty is outsourced from Colorado. Contract to not get audited. Half of what your earned. Going out of business. Have to fight for any work, including commission. Promises burned on you. Stay away! ",1.0

6,"February 01, 2018","I visited this location a few weeks looking to get an affordable, relatively new car as mine was not reliable at all. After looking at my options my salesperson, Blake finally got me into a brand new car with more than reasonable payments and then Monday set me up with a great 100,000 mile warranty. They were incredibly friendly and did everything they could to help me (rebates, higher than I expected trade in value etc.). This took a while as I came in on the weekend but I didn't mind at all because the staff was so incredibly personable. I HIGHLY recommend this dealership to anyone looking to avoid the typically soul-crushing car dealership experience.",5.0

8,"January 16, 2018","Went to look at a new F-250 Super Duty 2017. Met with Larry Peters at 5:30 pm on Saturday evening, the dealership closes at 6:00pm. To make a long story short 2 1/2 hours later I bought a new truck. Larry went way beyond what I expected from a Car salesman to do to make me happy. I went to Gulf Coast Ford, Ron Carter did not get this type of service at all. If these other dealers take notice they might sale more vehicles. Thanks Larry job well done ",5.0

11,"January 02, 2018","Easy, great, no hassle car deal for a new Ford Mustang. Very friendly and knowledgeable car dealers. I would recommend to others. Great experience and great dealer.",5.0
12,"December 20, 2017",Thank you Michael and Monday for a easy car buying experience. We traded in our 13 Explorer and drove away with a new 17 Explorer. We were given the opportunity to return for our detail on the car due to the weather. All in all a great experience. The only negative would be that the car was not gone over closely to make sure nothing is missing. Which would seem minor since it was one of the cup holder rubber liner. We love the vehicle. Thanks Yaklin Ford. ,4.6
13,"December 17, 2017","After visiting other Ford Dealers, we went to Yaklin Ford (Formerly Bobby Ford, Inc).  We were made to feel very welcome.  Christian took care of us throughout the whole transaction with the help of Joseph Lopez.  Mr Yaklin also came in to visit with us.  The entire transaction went smoothly except for some computer glitches shlowing us down.  I am enjoying my new vehicle.",5.0
14,"November 03, 2017",Very helpful. Help us with all or needs and questions. Everything was just perfect!! They treated me like family. My son was with my and he had all the attention. ,5.0
15,"March 18, 2016","I bought a 2007 Hummer H3 sight unseen from Joseph at Bobby Ford a few weeks ago.   Joseph went out of his way to answer all of my questions, take additional photographs of the vehicle,  answering a thousand emails and texts from me, taking care of a few concerns that I had, such as making sure the car was detailed prior to delivery, working with me on the deal and ultimately taking care of my needs as a buyer over 1000 miles away.  Joseph was a gem throughout the process.  The Hummer had a few additional issues like a bad battery and a cracked tail light that they took care of immediately.  I can't say enough good things about my buying experience with Joseph at Bobby Ford and for that, they get 5 stars.  Thank you, Joseph and the staff at Bobby Ford!  ",5.0
16,"February 13, 2014","No hassle just an easy car deal with a very knowledgable sales consultant. I would recommend Bobby Ford to anyone.
We got a great deal.",5.0
17,"August 14, 2013","I bought an HD 07 they took in on trade. we agreed on price. When salesman went to bring me papers to sign, he covered up price with his thumb. I told him let me read this, said I didn't need to, when I saw price was about 10 plus rather than the 7500 I offered, he said oh... office made a mistake. Took it back and brought me more paperwork, he knew I was in a hurry, trying to sign and get deal done as I had to be on offshore job by noon. I got frustrated and signed for about 7800. It was almost like the scene in the movie Fargo at the dealership,,,lol. I laugh now but its really not funny either then nor now. Would I do business with them again,,,I doubt it. Perhaps this guy doesn't work there any more, IDK, but in my opinion he was a crook. And if I see him again I wont hesitate to tell him so.
