0,"March 03, 2020","This is the worst case of old-school, used car dealer xxxx I’ve seen in my 25 years of car buying experience.  After hours spent waiting and the salesman stalling on every step of the process so they can wear you out and waste your time, they add $1000 to the advertised price of the car in BS, nothing warranties (wheel-lock warranty, anyone?) just to rip you off.  And then try to waste another hour of yours wearing you down about why they can’t remove those “options.”  I can not recommend anyone LESS than Sterling-McCall and I personally will NEVER go back.  This is why internet-only dealers with up-front pricing will win in car sales.  Sterling-McCall is filled with nothing but thieves and liars who don’t value their customers at all.  Never again.

1,"January 27, 2020","We own a 2018 Infinity Qx60, the Infinity version of the Nissan Pathfinder. Before this vehicle, we owned a 2014 Nissan Altima. The maintenance service products used for our QX60 are the same products used at our local Infinity dealer, only more cost effective. Gonzalo Gomez has been our Friend and Service Adviser for both vehicles. His attention to detail and level of expert customer service is UNPARALLELED. Gonzalo Gomez treats us like family and always, and I mean always, takes ownership of our issues and makes them his. We have been loyal customers of Sterling McCall Nissan since 2014. And because of Gonzalo Gomez, we will never, ever go anywhere else.",5.0

3,"October 24, 2019","The sales personnel and vehicle variety is on par or better than most other dealerships. However, once you start taking your car for a service, you will regret your purchase. We have owned vehicles from Sterling McCall Lexus, Sterling McCall Toyota, and made the mistake thinking that the Sterling name will provide the same excellent service uniformly. This is not the case at Sterling McCall Nissan. 
My car has been for a service 5 times now and it has never taken less than 2.5-3 hours - even for the very first one, which was just an oil change. YES, IT IS A NEW CAR. It now has around 25,000 miles and still new. I love the product but will be getting rid of it soon. Nissan makes the most comfortable cars its segment, but the service department ruins it - just not worth staying with the brand any longer because of this dealership. I will give Mossy a try, but after that I am done.
Most recently a speaker needed replacement - under warranty. It takes them 3 hours to investigate the problem. Then they agree to replace it and will call me when the part arrives (generally this takes 24 hours). Three weeks later, I have to call them but they cannot find record of it, and I had dealt with the service manager!!!!!!. Finally they figure it out, source the part and when we go in to replace it, we have to put up with the most arrogant of service advisers. He should not be in a service roll. Get the chip off your shoulder or leave. You are not doing anybody a favor by working there. We as the customers pay your salary and we are doing you a favor by supporting the brand and providing jobs. Your attitude, arrogance and nonchalant demeanor is unacceptable. But then again I am not surprised as you are right next to the service manager and he has a major attitude too - he will never admit fault or apologize, just keep defending the dealership. Please send him for training to Sterling McCall Toyota or Lexus or fire him cause his attitude is infecting the others. 

I hope you are still reading - but let me tell you, one way to avoid these types of complaints is picking up the phone or returning phone calls.

Soon to be ex-customer",1.6
4,"October 03, 2019","Unfortunately I have a Part II to my last review.  My friend's car buying experience at Sterling McCall Nissan included another totally dishonest person that took advantage of her as well. Justin Tran, a Finance Manager, took advantage of my naturalized citizen friend, with broken English, to the tune of $3,000. My friend told Justin over and over again that she DID NOT wanted any kind of warranty. Couldn't afford it. Justin, being the dishonest person that he obviously is, added a $3,000 extended warranty to the price of the car anyway. When I spoke with him face to face he said three times ""we'll refund the price of the warranty, we refund the price of the warranty."" He simply wouldn't answer my question ""Justin, why would you add a $3,000 warranty when she told you over and over again she didn't want one in the first place?"" Fortunately I was able to get the $3,000 refunded. Justin is a prime example of why most people absolutely dread going through Finance at a dealership. Don't ever be fooled into thinking that Finance represents your best interests. Save yourself a lot of money and hassle. Finance your vehicle through a credit union. I got my friend's Nissan refinanced with a credit union. From 5.07% at the dealership to 3.22% at the credit union. She'll save $4,500 over the life of her note.     ",1.0
5,"October 03, 2019","A good friend of mine called to see if I could help her get out a terrible situation at SMN. She is a naturalized citizen that speaks broken English. Salesman Patrick Agbebaku took advantage of her to the tune of $5,000. When I confronted Patrick he said he simply couldn't ""remember the price"" he gave her. Oh really? Of course he remembers screwing someone out of $5,000, unless that is his normal course of business. If you choose to do business with Sterling McCall Nissan, please don't work with Patrick Agbebaku. Your time and money are too precious.  ",1.0

117,"January 17, 2019","Went here after internet contact. Made a deal to lease a new Nissan Leaf. Came back to pick up my car one week later. My salesman didn't bother to show up at my confirmed appointment to pick up my car. Had to wait 20 min to find someone to help me. Once my car was found, they realized that no one was expecting me, so the car had no charge. Imagine that, an electric car with no charge, and they had week to prepare for me? I was there about an hour and half, and finally the car was charged enough for us to leave, and then they ran out and said we couldn't leave, as they forgot to put paper plates on it. More wasted time as they tried to find someone to do this. Then my car developed a terrible rattle on the way home. It was a broken strut. Then when I looked at my brand new car, I realized that one of the fenders didn't fit. An entire week to prepare my car for delivery, and not one person could be bothered to lift a finger and even look at my car until I arrived. So I had to put it in the shop, so here I am with a brand new car, and after 48 hours it has to go into the shop for 3 weeks! They replaced the front strut, and spent 1300 dollars fixing the fender. Then some idiot from the dealership called to try and appease me, and he didn't even know his own phone number? REALLY? I have his voice mail still on my phone. So I called the number that he left, which was disconnected, and then had to pull over on the side of the road and google the dealership and go through voice mail to find him to return his call. When I got him, I was pretty irritated, and he proceeded to lecture me that he didn't like my attitude? Go figure. I’m the one that got the royal shaft from their incompetence, and he doesn't like my attitude. What a jerk. Then after a month, I get a letter stating that my plates are in, and if I want them mailed to call this number. I did. Three times to accomplish what I needed. I don't know how these people stay in business, they are horrible, and just don't have a clue! Prepping a car for delivery, epic failure,  customer service, epic failure,  telephone operations, epic failure,  attempt to alleviate customers complaints from poor service, epic failure.",1.6

206,"April 10, 2018","***PLEASE READ*** If I could give this place 0 stars I would. This incident happened today (April 7, 2018). As crazy and strange as this may sound, we went in for an oil change and came home without our vehicle. Believe it or not, the vehicle was STOLEN from the dealership!!! We received a message via email that the car was ready, and also was told by the service people that the car was ready. Paid for the service, and was then told they could not locate the car. They attempted to look for the car for about 45 minutes, still no luck. Then they advised that they were about to look at the cameras, and even said they were looking at them. This took another 30 - 45 minutes. Only to then be told that they do not have access to the cameras, they are reviewed by another company. They knew from the beginning they did not have access to the cameras. It appears they were trying to buy time and come up with some lame excuse as to how this happened. The police were called and a report was made. However, they kept pushing the issue to call our insurance company and report it. And lets be very clear, this was not a repo, because another vehicle was missing around the same time, these cars were STOLEN from the dealership. After speaking with one of the service managers he advised that once the car is serviced it goes to the car wash, and after the car wash it is returned to the front and the keys are locked up. Well some kind of way the car did not make it from the car wash to the front, it disappeared. Come to find out the car wash is not even operated by the dealer, but by another company. So now its a ball game, I guess to see who will be held responsible for this incident. Mind you it is Saturday afternoon, and we have to wait until Monday before we hear something regarding the cameras. The thing that really ticked me off is that I went to ask the guy over the service department how this could have happened, he pretended as if he had no clue what I was talking about, as if he had never heard of the incident. He just kept telling me that's why they have the police investigating. No compassion what-so-ever! In a case like this regardless if the police are involved or not , a service manager should be more compassionate than he appeared. He did not even offer to refund the money we just spent for the service. Now we have to worry about other things along with this, since our address information and garage door opener was in the vehicle. Something as an address and garage door opener may not be a big deal to some people, but our sense of security has been rattled by this. This was a careless move by all involved in what we thought would be a simple oil change and car wash.
Update: 04/09/18 - So the camera footage is in and this was clearly an INSIDE JOB!!! While watching the footage myself I was in total disbelief by what I saw for the 2 minutes I viewed it. Sterling McCall Nissan wants to pretend like they do not see this mischief, and although this happened with the car wash, who again is not apart of the dealership, both parties are at fault. Sterling McCall Nissan hired this contractor (IVP Dealership Services) to wash their customer's vehicles and this car wash is on the property of Sterling McCall Nissan. As a matter of fact the car wash is connected to the building in some capacity. How do I know this because I was able to ride back there in my personal vehicle and no one stopped me!!! The vehicle that the crooks were riding in circled Sterling McCall Nissan dealerships parking lot for minutes and no one seemed to notice it. It is so easy for anyone to drive back there and do anything, however, someone should notice who belongs and who does not belong. Sterling McCall Nissan had faith in IVP Dealership Services enough to hire them to do services for them, and look how they have been failed by contracting services out! Just so happen that the GM is on vacation and the Service Manager will be going on vacation; both won't be back until Friday. Vacation? 2 CARS WERE STOLEN FROM YOUR ESTABLISHMENT!",1.0
207,"February 17, 2018","I WAS going to buy a new car at Sterling McCall Nissan in Stafford, TX and drove away for the second time.  I was there in December and had the same experience. Needed a new one because my old Alton's was wrecked.  Every single accessible parking space was occupied with new cars they were trying to sell.

There were multiple hiccups on getting a car that matched my requirements, and I ultimately had to settle for what they had, but paid more than online prices to have certain accessories added because they were not already factory installed. Salesmen were courteous, finance guy doesn't return calls. Overall experience was frustrating and I will never buy another car at this particular dealership.

To top it off I found out they put regular oil in my car when it should have been synthetic and i only found that out because my car was acting a little strange so I took it to another Nissan dealership and they called Sterling McCall to see why they didn’t use synthetic oil for my car. The advisor told me it could have ruined my engine. 

Second time I went, I waited 4 hours to have my battery checked. When my car was finished the advisor never told me. I had to go looking for Her myself and then she told me my car had been ready for almost an hour and she was sorry she didn’t see me even though I had been in the same seat since I sat down.

Me and my gf are a repeat customer at this dealership.  We both lost our vehicles during hurricane Harvey and went there do get a Nissan Rogue SL to replace the one we lost.  We were told they can get the color and trim level of the model we want so we went ahead and made the deal.  After spending 6 hours in this dealership, went thru finance, signed all the paperworks necessary, our sales lady came and told us that she cannot get us the vehicle we want until next Monday!  We went to have a conversation with their sales manager by the name of Mark.  We tried to explain to him the situation, what we were told, what actually took place.  I told him they shouldn't have gotten us thru finance if there is no car, how can we sign off on over 33k of finance without the actual vehicle? Instead of explaining and informing us on what they can do to make this situation right the sales manager gave us an attitude and cancelled our deal!  We were not buying a basic model mind u. I guess this dealership made too much money to prioritize customer service.  Our first experience with sterling was awesome and hassle free, now a year later we came back as repeated customer and end up got treated like trash.  Very disappointing to say the least",1.0

I than went back to sterling mccall  after my husband call and spoke to  salesperson  and salesperson told him to come by and he will let us see the pathfinder more closely or test drive . Well  we went in after work and met with sales person and like I said we had already choose with who we were going to finance the vehicle with and the sales guy also knew BUT he gets his sales manager they try to convince us to finance it with them and so I told them if they could match the bank rate than maybe we would do it . Well the sales guy and sales manager was taking too long and we had told them that we had people working at our house and we couldnt wait for them But they kept asking for 10 Minutes which was turning into 30 mins. So I decided to go look for them and tell them that I was just wanted to have my bank finance it and What I got from sales manager with a tone in voice was I REALLY DONT CARE WHO YOU FINANCE WITH . Well that was the time for me to get the xxxx out of that place where theres people who dont care But they  have you waiting there for  them for hrs . Got my purse and my told my husband to lets got out of here and as soon as we headed to doors the sales guy and manager come running after us  trying to stop us . But My husband told them that I  wasnt happy with their I dont care attitude and we were not going to buy nothing from them.  So we left .

After being given the runaround, on THREE separate occasions, I've decided to demand a refund for the service not performed by the dealership. Not to my surprise I was denied a refund and asked if I could WAIT once again for them to install the part, this time at my home. Problem is I live in Fort Worth. Time is extremely valuable to me and I'm forced to do something that I've never been pushed to do, Call the Police.

I informed him that I would return the next day for a test drive; however, upon returning Mr. Novak informed me that the vehicle was in use by someone else and it should return on Wednesday night 5/4/2016. I contacted him the morning of 5/5/2016 and was told the vehicle was on the lot and all I had to do was to submit an application. I called him and asked again was the vehicle on the lot and I was on my way to sign the papers. He informed me that my application had been approved . Upon arrival to the dealership I was informed that the vehicle that I had been approved for had been sold and he was to fond me another one of the same value. Of course there were none available; but, there was a brand new 2015 Dodge van I could purchase for much more than I had wanted .

326,"November 01, 2014","The bad review was earned by an employee named Dylan, the sales manager of all people!  My husband and I went there last night night to check out the CPO Rouges.  Lincey helped us, took us for a test drive  and was quite nice, until she started feeling her manager's pressure to close the sale right away.  We told her we had been already approved by our bank with a 3.49 % interest rate and that we would have to think over their offer, she kept coming back and forth from the manager's office.  He then came and asked if we would take their credit which would allow him to give us a better price IF he could get us 2.99% , we said that IF he DID we WOULD, but still would have to think about it, it was taking them awfully long to get the numbers ready, so we decided to leave because our kids were expecting us to take them to their Halloween events, but they stopped us offering to remove the CPO fee and the extra charge for the leather seats, we headed to the door anyway:   they were putting too much pressure to close the sale right away.  Dylan ran outside to stop us and offered us an unbeatable price, $5,000 less than what he originally quoted, he asked for an immediate answer, so we said yes.
We signed a bunch of papers, then were taken to the financing department and were helped by a very nice employee who then proceeded to sell us the gold extended guarantee, which we did not expect, but we decided to buy a conservative option of it.  We signed papers and papers and when we came to the very last one we asked where the interest rate was and there it was on the VERY LAST paper:  5.1% so we said that was not what we were offered.  He called Dylan who came and started yelling that he had said ""IF""  which we had answer to ""IF you DO""  so he became very rude and said it was good we were leaving because ""I can get someone else to give ME more money for it"".  The financing guy apologized and shred our papers and said he'd talk to his manager about the interest rate, we asked him to talk about Dylan's rudeness to clients which is unacceptable.  So we left.
To our surprise Dylan was outside waiting for us to HARASS us.  He kept raising his voice telling my husband he couldn't believe we were leaving for  a .5% difference,  demanding my husband to discuss everything ""man to man""  and since we kept walking he started yelling that we would not even stop and demanding his ""man to man discussion""  my husband pointed his finger at him and said (not yelled) ""Don't you raise your voice"" and he continued yelling now about the pointed finger.  We proceeded to walk toward our car and I only said ""This is not a man to man argument , you are the salesman and we are the costumers and this is no way to treat customers"".
Talk about Halloween!  We wasted three hours and I left totally UPSET, SCARED, and WITHOUT A CAR.

taken back to prep for delivery when we got out of finance, when I got car home noticed a blinker/marker light out on front. Opened hood and saw none of the fluids were filled. Looked underneath to fixed burnout light instead of traveling 48 miles back to stealership, there was no 
light harness to put bulb in, completely gone. Car only had 12 miles on it. Ordered the splash guards when I was there, salesperson kept saying they should be there, month later, finally here. Now they have lost the $ 30,700 check I gave them a month ago and know one  knows where its at and know one is returning my phone calls or messages. Go figure.

 I just bought a brand new Juke form Sterling McCall Nissan and could not be happier. My Credit Union has a car buying program to obtain pre-arranged pricing for members. I was matched with Armando (sales agent) at Sterling McCall and can sincerely say that this was far and away the best purchase experience I have EVER had. He showed me exactly what I wanted and treated me with the greatest respect, integrity, warmth, and professionalism.  The sales manager on duty was Mark who also went out of his way to make us as happy and comfortable as humanly possible. There were none of those shady tactics that make people hate buying cars – just really professional people trying to offer the best experience they can to their customers. Further, the financing manager, Shaq, was informative and friendly with NO pressure or attempts to up-sell at the last minute. Just a clear statement of all the options as the deal came to a close.

We explained to him what we were looking for as well as the price range and color.  He pointed out some models, we took a test drive and the rest is history.  I must say that Shelby went above and beyond to ensure we were happy with our purchase.  When we got home and started to admire our purchase we noticed that we didn't have a cargo cover. I immediately called Shelby to inquire about the cargo cover and was told, much to my dismay, that this particular model was not equipped with one (SUVs in this price range should be equipped with a cargo cover). When I finally calmed down Shelby told me he would order one for me. My response, how much is that going to cost me. Shelby said, he'd look into it and let me know. Well, he ordered the cargo cover and when it came I received a call, and much to my delight, it was free and in he threw in a key cover and key chain to boot.

339,"July 23, 2010","We pretty much feel the same as most folks do about the car-buying routine ... would rather be at the dentist having a root canal. This time, however, we were blown away by the cordial and congenial sales staff we encountered. Our objective was to drive every small SUV on the market (which we did), then shop for that dealership which would treat us as valued consumers (or at worst, one which made us the least uncomfortable).  We had a prior experience at another Sterling McCall store (Toyota), where we were descended upon like road kill by vultures (we felt we deserved better treatment, and promptly terminated the transaction). We figured that at least we could drive the Rogue at the Sterling McCall Nissan store (it's closest to our home) and buy it elsewhere. To our surprise, nobody was lurking in the parking lot, and we were courteously greeted by Patrick Akbebaku as we enterd the showroom. After driving the vehicle, we informed him that we intended to try other brands, to which he replied, ""That's fine. If you decide on a Rogue, come back and see me.""  As is customary, we also spoke with the sales manager, Troy Cecil, who provided us with impartial comparison information about all the SUV's we were considering. There was no pressure to ""buy now,"" and he didn't even get into numbers. We almost wanted to begin the process then and there, but just had to drive them all to be certain. The following day, we returned to Sterling McCall, after deciding that the Rogue was our vehicle of choice.  Negotiations were professional, civil, and low-key. After doing all of the research about invoice, holdback, trade-in values, rebates, cost of similar vehicles, etc. (a good couple of hours on the computer) we had come up with a comfortable number.  The final price was actually lower, and we got a bit more equipment than we expected.  Ten days later, we bought another one ... same treatment, same cordiality. The vehicles are exceptional, but every Nissan dealer has them. What matters is being treated with the respect and dignity we expect, but hardly ever receive at an auto dealership. Sterling McCall Nissan has indeed earned our business.
