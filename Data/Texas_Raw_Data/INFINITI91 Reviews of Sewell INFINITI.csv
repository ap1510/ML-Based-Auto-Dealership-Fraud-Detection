They sell you lemon vehicles oh, they're very prejudiced, biased, everyone that works there was any type of authority is Caucasian and they treat black people like they're nothing they sell you a lemon vehicle and then kick you off their promises and tell you not to come back I would not tell my worst enemy to go to this place to purchase a vehicle unless they're Caucasian that is.",1.0

Dominic Fulbright always takes good care of me. Recently I needed some extensive work done on my car. Dominic went above and beyond to help me, by offering options and a schedule of what services were a priority. Over a year we were able to take care of all the issues. I am truly grateful for his help.",5.0
10,"April 17, 2019","I am not happy with the last two visit. 
Both visits I request for the service department to refill my wiper reservoir and both times they neglected to do so. I will not return  .I don't know if it is because my car is older or if there is a leak or if they just don't do that service. I guess I should have checked both times before I left. I have complained to both service advisors and they have yet to call me back. I am surprised at Sewell,.

11,"February 21, 2019","PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE READ BEFORE YOU GO HERE!!!!!!!
I wanted to be sure EVERYONE knows what they are getting into before dealing with this dealership. I was sold a lie by my sales person Kyle. When I purchased this car I was told all these promises of what a great experience buying from Sewell. You can make your own judgement if that is true. 
To start I was told that part of the Sewell experience was free oil changes, loaner cars, pick up service, all point inspections on cars so you don’t have to worry about getting a bad car, free car washed, and this great Sewell service we would be provided if we choose this dealership. The oil change is a two week wait, and this is not covered. I was told it would be $65. And the car wash is a long wait as well, unless you schedule ahead, and not free. They will give a run through the wash, but its $200 to have it cleaned. Loaner cars are given but you have to drop off your car and get the loaner. The pickup service is only for routine things, but it is a two week wait. I had my car in the shop prior to this time for a headlight. Which I had to take off to take up there or drive for two to three weeks with a broken headlight since it would take that long to schedule a pick up and loaner. 
I have made one car payment on my car and have had it in the shop twice. The all point inspections was horrible. The original inspection has concerns with engine dive belt, brakes, suspension, tires, and alignment. However, I didn’t know about that until I caught my sales person in a lie. When I bought the car, I was told that all preowned cars go through a detailed all points inspection. This is the Sewell guarantee to their valued consumers. 
This was the second time I had to put my car in the shop. I noticed that it was make a weird noise, so I called the service department. Once again, I was told the car pick up service wouldn’t apply here since it was an issue. I took off work to take it since the noise sounded bad and the car was shaking. Two days later I was told by my service rep, Haley, there was $3000 of repairs needed. The suspension, arm bearings, alignment, and radiator fan needed to be repaired. I asked why I was being asked to pay that and if I could see the multi point inspection done on my car prior to purchase. I was sent a report that was a checklist, looked like something off Google. The checklist had everything checked like the inspection was all good. When I asked for the new inspection because this didn’t look right, I was told she can’t get that for me. I had my service lady help with obtaining the two report to compare. Once I looked at the REAL reports, I could see I was lied to many times. The original inspection has concerns with engine dive belt, brakes, suspension, tires, and alignment. Which means all the repairs I was asked to pay should have been addressed before they sold me this car. Plus the money I am being asked to pay isn’t covering the brake repairs that need to be made as well. Which means by the time I make two car payments my car will have been services three times. 
This whole experience has been horrible. I have been lied to over and over by this dealership. I was sold a lie and a car with multiple problems. 
I cannot believe I am being asked to pay $1500 for repairs THAT WERE THERE WHEN THEY SOLD ME THIS CAR. DON’T BUY FROM THIS PLACE. If you do make sure you get all the inspections reports and buy the warranty. Your going to need it. Remember these parts are extra expense and this dealership will tell you anything to sell a car. I am so disappointed in the experience I have had with them. I thought I was going to get a high-end dealership with many perks. Instead, I got a bad car and a dealership that doesn’t care once they got me to sign.

12,"November 06, 2018","Was told Sewell has excellent customer service, you can be the judge. After spending a couple hours with the sales associate on the phone. I was sent an agreement and told to wire funds to confirm purchase of a CLS 550. I wired funds in full to Sewell (half a year’s income for median household family). Was told the car would be on the way by associate after wire. Took 3 hours to confirm receipt of wire by finance. Was then told by the associate my car was sold to another individual. Talked to GM Mr. Baker. He was pleasant and said would fix the problem, however here we are 2 weeks later with no car. If it were my dealership, I would purchase the same or better car from Autotrader, AutoNation, another dealership or Mercedes Japan if had to ASAP in order to fix that epic mistake. I do not want to hear you cannot find another car on this planet like it. This is not some exotic Lambo or Ferrari. Just my two cents, I do not have time for excuses. Will update. ",1.4

14,"January 30, 2018",I leased this vehicle last December and since was medically discharged from the Army and lost income.  Sewell and Infiniti have been unwilling to provide any assistance or help.  I regret giving them my business.  Most unpatriotic business that I’ve dealt with.,2.4

18,"August 30, 2016","Bought my G37 from Allision Cohen about 5 years ago and built a great relationship with her and the Sewell dealership family. This caused me to have a great deal of trust in this dealership until recently when I was a victim of hail damage and had to decide where to take my vehicle for repairs.  Although I live in Frisco which is quite a ways away from the Dallas Sewell location I decided that I would make the trip and bring my vehicle to the ones that I'd built trust in over the years assuming that they would definitely do things right.  I dropped my vehicle off on 7-27-16 with Chris Girard who walked the vehicle with me and assured me that they would take care of it and it should take about 2 to 2.5 weeks max.  He also pointed out that one of the dings had caused a little paint chip that was on the left ledge of the vehicle and the back window, however it was in a good place because it shouldn't require that they repaint.  I left with the expectation of my car repairs being done with quality and returned to me in a better state than when I dropped it off.  During the repair period I communicated with Chris on a number of occasions due to the fact that Sewell requested at least two additional supplements.  Upon the request of the second supplement, I made a phone call to Chris to ask why they were requesting this supplement because it was to authorize them to repaint the rear quarter panel of my vehicle.  I informed Chris that this is not what we'd discussed and I would rather that they not repaint only a panel of my vehicle because I was worried about it matching the rest of the paint.  He assured me that there would be no difference and because my vehicle was black I wouldn't notice it at all.  About a week later I received communication from Chris that the paint (which was the last portion of the repairs) was complete and my vehicle was being reassembled.  Being that 3.5 weeks had passed by this time and that my Rental period was ending in a few days with my Insurance company, I called Chris to find out when I could expect to pick my vehicle up.  He stated that my vehicle was getting ready to go to paint to which I responded, I just received a status from a few days ago that paint was completed and my vehicle was being reassembled.  He stated that he must have sent that to the wrong person and apologized but my vehicle hadn't yet been painted.  Worried that I would now be responsible for paying for my own rental after what was promised as a 2 to 2.5 week max job has now turned into being over a month I asked Chris if Sewell would be providing me a form of transportation for the remainder of the repair period.  He stated he would see what he could do.  After about 2 days of my expiration period I received a call from Chris stating that my vehicle was now ready for pickup.  My wife and I drove down to pick up the vehicle and was immediately asked to sign the supplement checks.  Before signing, my wife asked to see the vehicle.  When they brought the vehicle around I went out myself to inspect and immediately noticed that the paint was totally different and noticeable to which I informed the Estimator this is not what Chris promised.  I also noticed in several more places where the paint seemed to be chipped or missing.  I went back in the lobby and asked my wife to go and take a look.  She asked what I saw and I told her I didn't want to say anything because I wanted to see her reaction.  She spent about 10 min out with the Estimator and came back in and immediately asked, ""What did they do to the car"".  She felt as I did that our vehicle looked worse now than when we'd brought it in.  We expressed our feeling to the Estimator who took me in his office and said we took before pictures so let's look at before pictures.  When he pulled the pictures up, I told pointed out how good our paint looked when we dropped the vehicle off and he response was, that just the light and the shadows from the sun.   I received a call from Chris on the following Monday and he also tried to justify it by saying that it was like that when we brought it in and threaten to stop paying for the rental car if I didn't bring it in.  I escalated it to Sam Weston who to my understand is the GM who also said it must have been that way being that the car is about 5 years old.  I'm now in the process of having my insurance company serve as a mediator to see what can be done about our dissatisfaction. Unbelievable....and really sad because my wife and I were also considering the purchase of another Infiniti this year based on the Trust that we thought we'd established with this dealership.",1.2
19,"December 08, 2015","I used to enjoy going to this dealerships matter fact I bought my Infiniti of this location but I also but a Mercedes at park place and either this location used provide  first class service but  now sewell infiniti in Dallas  has changed a lot and for the worst I took my car for an oil change and it took about 15 minutes before somebody came to me and asked if i could be help but that's not all I also took my car to service because it overheat once and they had told me that I had to replace the entire engine which was $10,000 in spending so i decided to take it to a different location and the only problem I have with my car was the gaskets which was fixed for less than $500 so that was a rip off right there I'm not sure if I can trust them anymore because I really was thinking on buying another infiniti.",1.2

I have never zipped through the car buying process this quickly. I would recommend them to anyone without hesitation!  Well worth the drive!!,5.0
23,"August 11, 2012","This was my first Infiniti purchase.  Sewell and Infiniti both deserve the reputations they have earned.  I could not have designed a better experience.  
Allison was a ""no pressure"" sales consultant.  Consultant is the precise word; she consulted with me every step of the way...making sure the JX was the correct vehicle and not foisting equipment/options/accessories that were of no benefit to me.

The sales process was smooth and professional.  No 37 counter offers or ""let me see what we can do.""

Allison respected my time every step of the way, especially when I was signing the paperwork and going over the features on the JX.

I will gladly recommend Allison and Sewell Infiniti to family, friends and anyone else who is in the market for a vehicle.",5.0

Erica and dealership are definitely the best ! After I picked up my new car. She also did a excellent job on following up and make sure I am happy with everything.

32,"June 21, 2011","I purchased a 2010 Infinity G37. Love the car when top is down but despised it with top up. Brought car in 4 different times for a week at a time and the rattle never got resolved. I feel extremely blessed that that Infinity Corporate purchased this car back under the ""Lemon Law"" and replaced it with a 2011 model.  Carl Sewell of Dallas did every thing possible to try to resolve the rattle and was never successful. This is the reason that I bought from Sewell  and this is the reason that I will buy another car from this dealership and will also tell my friends how this dealers. 

Thomas Garland was my salesperson with my 2010 G37 and with the transfer of my 2011 G37.  He is very professional and I was most impressed with him.  He is the reason that I will buy another car from Sewell of Dallas. Thomas Garland Rocks.

Also, Travis Erb was quite impressive how he handled my situation. 

Thank you to all of you and God Bless.

36,"June 20, 2011","Went in to get a used infiniti and requested for Erica. Even though she handles new car sales, she came down to the used car sales centre and helped me pick an M35 (over the course of 3 days). She was very knowledgeable on the car and made sure I went through a lot of options to pick up the car I wanted. The car I wanted was in Plano, she went out of her way to get the car to Dallas have it checked out before advising me to purchase it. She and other people I interacted with were exceptional with customer service. This is way the car buying experience should be. Sewell and Erica are indeed TOP CLASS!!! Will definitely get my next car here even if I have to come down from Georgia.",4.8
37,"April 05, 2011","As shown by the rating on the site, I concur that Sewell Dallas is pretty darn good.  As with many folks these days I started my purchase investigation on the internet.  Using my companies Infiniti/Nissan VPP discount, I made contact with every dealer in Texas.  Some did not respond, some would not come down much from the ""standard"" deal.  Erica Curry responded from Sewell with an outstanding offer as the discount through my company had changed mid month and she was the first to investigate and notify me of this special deal.  The fact that she came in with this deal first and also that her boss often posts on Edmunds.com with valuable Infiniti updates, deal commentary, etc., I decided to pull the trigger with Sewell Dallas (though I live in Houston).  My last new car deal was on a Dodge Ram which got pretty nasty with the dealer (Spring Dodge, sorry had to do it) trying to rob me during the paper work stage, so I was intent on putting Erica through the ringer and walk away at the first sign of monkey business.  I guess the Infiniti business, and more specifically Erica, is not the Dodge business and their employees.  Erica was available for calls, answered all my questions, and worked through any issues we had in getting the car we wanted.  To be frank, she worked damn hard considering what the dealer makes off a VPP sale.  The deal was done by phone/email, paperwork went smooth with no $300 VIN etch fees thrown in for fun at the last minute.  Erica found out during the deal that she couldn't sell me a Sewell Houston car but we were able to reach a deal on the car of my wife's dreams and have it trailered down to Houston.  Delivery to my house went smooth.  Erica was a well dressed professional who promptly cleaned out my wallet (by my request) and then spent over an hour going through the features of the car before we called it a day. The paperwork copies and plates showed up in the mail within 2 weeks with Erica closing out the deal with a cookie delivery.  Considering the logistics of this two city deal, I can't imagine the deal going much smoother.  Thanks to Erica and Sewell for a great experience.

39,"September 30, 2010","WOW! is the only way to describe our recent vehicle purchase experience with salesperson Allison Cohen at Sewell Infiniti of Dallas.  About 2 weeks ago my wife and I purchased our brand new 2010 Infiniti G37 from Sewell in Dallas.  Being the person I am, it normally takes me quite a while to make these kinds of purchases and this case is no different.  My experience actually started about 9 months ago with Allison.  Knowing our intent to make a purchase, I inquired via the internet about the Infiniti G37 Sedan.  Allison Cohen was the one to address and handle all of my concerns.  I immediately explained to her that this was just an inquiry and the actual purchase would probably be between 9months to a year from then.  Quite Amazing and impressively, Allison managed to maintain contact with me and provide all the answers to my inquiries the entire time without ever pressuring me toward a purchase decision.  About 3 weeks ago my wife and I decided to purchase a pre-owned G37 and actually made the purchase from an out of state dealer. When the vehicle arrived we discovered that many of the options that we were sold were not included on the vehicle. To our disappointment we had to send the vehicle back to the dealer.  After this experience we realized that the best thing for us would be to go ahead and purchase a new one if all of the parameters would fall in our favor. I decided to call Sewell and speak directly to the Sales Manager Steven Haynes.  I explained to Steven what we had gone through and what we desired to do.  I asked for his best price on a brand new 2010 Infiniti G37 with the premium package. Steven gave us a deal that was almost too good to be true.  I was later contacted by Allison Cohen who picked the ball back up for us to continue handling the transaction.  It took us about a week to get the other vehicle returned and finally get to the Sewell dealership.  From the moment we walked into the dealership until the time we walked out with our brand new Infiniti, the service was no less than PERFECT!  The entire staff assured that we were well cared for.  They took care of our kids needs while my wife and I completed the purchase.  Allison was terrific in assuring that we were familiar with all of the options available on the vehicle.  She was very thorough in explaining the process and stepping us through it.  Even in the finance office Blake Huddleston (hope I got the name right) was terrific and HONEST in going over all of the additional options available to us.  And when we got to the numbers, the only surprise that I got was an even lower payment than what I’d expected and calculated. I’ve never felt this good after purchasing a vehicle and acquiring a car payment.  The Sewell team is amazing.  I would definitely recommend this dealership to anyone and Allison Cohen is the one you’ll want to do business with over and over again.  Thanks Allison!  And Thanks to the Sewell Family!

40,"July 29, 2010","I recently purchased my second new Infiniti from Scott Shaw at Sewell Infiniti and would absolutely recommend him to everyone! He made the buying experience easy, fast, and painless. He answered all of my questions and was quick to respond to every phone call and e-mail. Even though I knew what car I wanted he still took the time to explain the car and options, test drive it, and make sure it was exactly what I wanted. He did not try to ""up sell"" me on added features and was straight forward about pricing. Scott also lined up the financing for me and made it as easy as possible over the phone. Once the paperwork was drawn up we dealt with the finance manager, Blake Huddleston and he was great also. He took the time to explain what we were signing and answer any questions. The buying experience with Sewell is the best! Haggle free, no pressure, and you don't get the ""run around"". I also have to brag on the service department as well! I voluntarily drive 45 minutes to have my car serviced at Sewell even though there is another Infiniti dealership closer. :) I have never had to worry that I would not be taken care of at Sewell Infiniti.

41,"June 03, 2010","Being 24 and just graduating from college, this was my 1st experience in buying my 1st vehicle. I had always heard such great things about Sewell, and was set on purchasing a vehicle from them. 

We had been in contact by email and phone for about 2 weeks (because I was out of town), and we had made arrangements that the one weekend I had free, I would make the 6 hour drive to Dallas to purchase an Infiniti FX35. When I got there, the salesman was too busy with a ""doctor,"" even though we had an appointment with her. In the meantime, we were set up with a different salesman that was completely clueless about the vehicle we were interested in and constantly walked around with a ""cheat sheet"" because she didn't know any answers to our questions. 

Many different people at the dealership, including some of the managers, made many promises they couldn't keep. I was furious I wasted my time here, and was on the verge of tears after leaving because the process was so stressful. Even after showing the sales managers emails I received from the particular salesman stating what they could do for me, they didn't do a thing to help resolve the issues at hand. 

One of my friends used to be employed by Sewell and let me know the actual negotiation range the salesmen have to work with, yet they wouldn't negotiate a single penny on the cost of any used FX35's. I felt very taken advantage of and could not have had a worse experience here.

I ended up going to Crest Infiniti in Plano and purchased a brand new 2010 FX premium pkg for around the same price Sewell was trying to sell me a 2007-2008 Fx. I will never bother going here again and would not recommend it to anyone!",1.8
42,"May 07, 2010","This was the second purchase we have made from Sewell Infiniti.  First experience was good - this experience was even better.  Conversed over the internet with Scott before going to Dallas to look for a vehicle.  He was such a pleasure to deal with both over the internet and in person.  Traded in a SL Mercedes on the new Infiniti G35 - which just happened to be the one on the showroom floor.  Scott had to move all the vehicles on the showroom floor to get to the one we wanted - but did it himself.  He had our paperwork done - we gave him a check for the beautiful car and we noticed several small bubbles in the tinting on the passenger side window. He had the tinting redone - and make ready done within an hour. He went over everything we needed to know about the vehicle and we were on our way home.  It was a ""Miller Moment"" - it just doesn't get any better than that!!! ",4.8
43,"April 16, 2010","I would like to thank Erica Curry for making my new car experience pleasurable. I had read and heard stories about how dealerships attempt to pressure consumers to purchase vehicles; however at Sewell I felt comfortable. This was my first experience and I did not feel pressured. I was amazed at how knowlegdable Erica was about the G37 Sport coupe. She also gave me more options that I had not fully considered. I was able to get the car that I was looking for with all of the options. The process was painless and enjoyable. I was very impressed how thourough Erica was when I picked up my vehicle. She truly made me feel as though I was her number one priority at that time. I did not feel rushed and she allowed my friend and I to ask her questions. If there was something that I did not understand she reviewed the information.  

I have choosen to rate all the above categories a 5 because this truly was a FANTASTIC experience for me. Jack Chen with the finacial department was also excellent and allowed me to take my time reviewing the paperwork as well as answering all of my questions. I was also set up with Troy Dunn when it is time for me to come in for services. I did not know that Sewell provided additional services to ensure customer satisfaction.  I would recommend Sewell and Erica to anyone who is considering to purchase an Infiniti. In fact, my friend who came for support will soon become an Infiniti customer.  I look forward to furture endeavers with Erica, Jack, Troy and Sewell.",5.0
44,"April 01, 2010","I have purchased two new cars from Scott Shaw at Sewell Infiniti and have had both cars serviced there, even after I moved from Dallas to work in Austin and then in San Antonio.  The dealership is the best I've ever dealt with in terms of both new car sales and vehicle service (and that includes the great Sewell Lexus dealership in Dallas, where I've also done business.) I have driven to Dallas (from Austin and San Antonio) to buy cars from Scott and get them serviced at Sewell because no other dealership comes close to the service they provide.  They treat me fairly and honestly, they know their products, the dealership facility is spotless and comfortable, they always have loaner cars available, and every employee from the person who greets you in the garage to the cashier who checks you out is competent and treats you with respect. 

However, no employee could be any better than Scott Shaw.  He is knowledgeable, personable, helpful without being pushy, and a really nice guy.  He even drove my last new car to Austin to deliver it to me.  I'll bet everyone who buys a car from Scott thinks that he has become a friend - and they're probably right.  Every time I am in a business meeting where customer service is discussed, I mention Sewell Infiniti as the business model for how to do it right.  ",5.0

Our Sales Associate, Erica Curry, greeted us with a friendly smile and a wealth of knowledge on the Infiniti brand. She spent the day with us test driving an Infiniti QX56 and explaining everything we would need to know about this SUV. Erica worked with us to get the best incentives Infiniti had to offer.  She was a true joy to work with for the entire day!  When we drove off in our new Infiniti we truly felt that we had joined the Sewell family. Erica followed up with us later in the week to make sure that we were having a great experience with our new QX56. As far as  Excellent Customer Service goes Sewell definitely wrote the book on it!

47,"February 24, 2010","I visited Infiniti dealerships. Twice visited and emailed several times in Austin, Texas through 2009, and once in Little Rock, Arkansas, after the deal was very firm from Dallas' dealership. My wife and I visited our local Nissan dealership in Midland, Texas, for a Maxima. All the dealerships were friendly and welcoming, the Dallas Infiniti building and personnel helped my wife and I feel as though we had walked into a fine welcoming home. We were welcomed with a good balance, not too much attention, but just what felt comfortable. I had emailed and spoken to sales folks in Austin and (D.D. in)Dallas. I was a very slow shopper because it took a while to save the cash on my end and also get a good price from a dealership. At Dallas Infiniti, D.D. was available and patient.
The process of making the purchase, signing forms and the personal check was not at all stressful or rushed. Once done, D.D. showed his heart as a teacher as he walked my wife and I through the electronics and features of our new car. 
I will  most likely go back to Dallas, from Midland for important warranty service. For some things I may use my local Nissan dealer. It would be thrilling to have an Infiniti point here in Midland. We actually have roads which are designed for 80 mph travel! The car ... is like driving a land speeder ... The car's special scratch healing finish is remarkable. Thank you for asking. Herb  ",5.0

I had an Acura TL, and was considering just buying a new one, when a friend mentioned how great the Infinity was.  I stopped by Sewell Infinity one day in 2007, and met Scott Shaw.  I was very impressed, and Scott was very patient!  I test drove several models from the G35 to the FX35... and fell in love.  I am the proud owner of an FX35, and the only way I would give up this vehicle is to upgrade to the new FX.  Scott was never too busy to help me with my calls and questions about the cool technology I was so unfamiliar with, and now couldn't live without.

57,"February 22, 2010","All the individuals I've encountered at Sewell Infiniti in Dallas are top notch.  But for me, it goes beyond that.  I had the unfortunate experience of getting into a traffic accident in my new Infiniti on the day that I picked it up from the dealership, just minutes away from arriving safely at home.  I had only driven the car about 7 miles before it was wrecked!  I had the car repaired, but as you can imagine, I never got to experience the pleasure and excitement of having a ""new"" car.  From that point on just seeing the car was a stomach-turning reminder of what had happened, and a reminder that I was ""stuck"" with it for the remainder of my lease.  

BUT that all came to an end when Scott Shaw at Sewell Infiniti helped me to get into a new one.  He and the rest of the team at Sewell knew about what had happened to me and they found a way to get me out of the wrecked car and into a brand new one with minimal expense to me.  No one else at my insurance company nor at my previous leasing company even offered to help me explore my options on getting a new car, but Scott did.  He helped make it happen.  

Now my new Infiniti (same car, different color) really seems like the car I should have had all along and I love it!  I'm very thankful to Scott and Sewell for helping me out and they've got a customer for life as far as I'm concerned.  ",5.0

The leasing company put me in touch with Scott Shaw in fleet sales.  Scott was quick to respond to all questions, was very friendly and professional.

I've spent a considerable amount of time researching my options and visiting 3 different Infiniti dealerships and also visited a BMW and Mercedes dealership. The purchase experience with Allison at Sewell Infiniti was by far the best I've ever experienced. The negotiation process was great. Unlike some other dealerships, they didn't play the typical game of the salesperson going back to the manager 3 or 4 times to get the ""best"" deal and attempt to wear me down after 4 hours (Yes, Crest Infiniti I'm talking about you). Allison was very informative, courteous and professional. Allison and the finance manager made the paperwork process really quick and smooth (got it done during my lunchhour). Allison has even followed up several times after the sale to make sure that everything is going well and that I'm happy with my purchase.

74,"February 20, 2010","So far I have leased two vehicle and purchased one vehicle from this dealership and I just have to say that they are amazing. Firstly sales is no pressure, low key and enjoyable. The sales staff is very knowledgeable and our sales person Allison Cohen is amazing. She provides you with the information you need to make an informed decision and if something clicks, she is great getting the deal finalized. 

At many other dealerships such as Park Place Mercedes, this is usually where the pleasant experience ends and the service nightmare begins, however Carl Sewell's take on customer service permeates this dealership and sets it apart from other dealerships. His motto of ""Customers for Life"" is the basis for the excellent customer service in every aspect of this dealership.

Unlike my experience with Park Place Mercedes, Mitch in loan cars has never put me in anything other than an Infiniti loan car when my vehicle is in the shop. The loan cars are always new and clean.

My Service Advisor Olie Hedge and the Service manager Travis Erb provide me with fast convenient and enjoyable service on my terms. Olie keeps me informed of the progress during service and I would not get my vehicle serviced anywhere else. 

Whenever I return to pickup my vehicle, I never wait long, the cashiers are friends and efficient and the cookies are always warm and yummy. When I lived in Austin, I drove to Dallas to get my vehicle serviced at Sewell and will do so in perpetuity.
