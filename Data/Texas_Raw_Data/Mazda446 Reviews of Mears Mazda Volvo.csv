0,"April 02, 2020","I shopped around online and found the car I wanted for the price I wanted.  They emailed me a Carfax report upon request, answered all my questions, and there was zero pressure.  I filled out an online credit application and the numbers they came back with were better than my bank was offering.  We agreed to terms via email and they sent me an out-the-door quote sheet.  My wife and I got on a plane with 6 passengers during the CoronaVirus scare.  We flew from Kansas City to Lubbock and we’re picked up by the dealership.  The paperwork was ready, the numbers were all as discussed with no surprises.  We verified the 2017 Hyundai Azera Limited was in good shape, signed everything, and were on the road early for our 10 hour drive back to KC.  Thank you Ken, Kiefer, and Jason for making this long distance, sight unseen, good faith purchase as painless as possible.",5.0

14,"November 19, 2019","Coming from someone who has never done business with Mears, I felt like I had been a long time customer. Doing business from 388 miles away in San Antonio was almost effortless on my end.

When it was time to make a deal I was treated professionally and fairly. Although I was offered free pickup and delivery I opted to drive to Lubbock and pick up the vehicle since I went to Texas Tech and was accommodated with my decision. Great experience, great service, I would definitely do business with Mears again. This is truly a WOW story!  Thank you Thomas and Jeremy! ",5.0

Then when they tried to send me numbers, tried to send me a price $3000 over that.  Don't deal with these sketchy salespeople. Salesperson made a deal she couldn't keep just to up her sales numbers.",1.0

81,"August 14, 2019","I bought a car at this dealership, and overall I had a good experience. One thing I hate about car shopping are pushy salesmen. The salesmen here were not pushy. They were very respectful and understood that buying a new car is a huge decision and one that should not be made lightly. Also, they let the car speak for itself! I love my new car and it’s one that I’ve had my eyes on it for over a year. My ONLY complaint is that when I was test driving the car, I was told several times (once by my current salesman and the salesman who helped me several months prior when I was looking) that the car I was interested in purchasing had a Turbocharged engine. I later found out, after purchasing,  that it was not turbocharged  I don’t think they did this on purpose to push a sale (wouldn’t make sense because most would try and upsale to turbo) They may have just been misinformed. I bought a Mazda Grand Touring CX-5. The turbo engine was the Grand Touring Reserve, which is one trim above the Grand Touring. It wasn’t a main selling point for me because there are many things I love about the CX-5. I also should have done research to make sure they were telling me correctly, but If I had been told correctly, I probably would have upgraded to the Grand Touring Reserve. Anyway, all of that aside, the experience was a good one. ",4.8
82,"August 11, 2019","Thomas  Booth was a very helpful and knowledgeable staff of Mears Mazda.  We weren’t sure what we wanted but he helped us look at many different cars.  We were thankful for him to help us because there was no pressure with buying and he answered every question we asked.  We did end up burying from him because of  his kindness and help.   Would recommend him to any friend of ours.  Thank you Thomas for an excellent experience.

86,"August 10, 2019","I bought my first car from them. I asked if the car had a 2nd key. I was told yes by my sales man and was told my husband could come get it. My husband goes to pick it up, the lady who is in charge of the keys told my husband she gave it to my sale guy. I tried to call my sales guy for a week straight. Doesn’t have a voicemail set up nor will he return my calls. I go up there on my day off, the sales manager told me he would look into it and call me back by the end of business day. Which was a lie. I had to call him. He asked if my sales guy called me and I said no if he did I would not be calling.  He told me he was going to talk to his GM and call me the very next day.

My first vehicle purchase, upon graduation from Texas Tech, was a Mazda RX-7 from Mears Mazda in 1983. I had always received excellent service and I was happy to see that had not changed. I contacted Mears about servicing my 2018 CX-5 and was immediately contacted by Jason White who helped me set up an appointment and gave me information on what scheduled service needed to be done.  The day of my appointment with Mears I was greeted by Austin Morris. I needed an oil and filter change. Austin kept me updated on the progress of my service. Austin also showed me my cabin filter which he said was fine and could wait until next servicing. My appointment took about 25 minutes to complete and they had even washed my car.  Thanks again Mears Mazda. I am happy to be back in Lubbock and even happier that customer service at Mears Mazda is still excellent. ",5.0

I will never buy another Volvo because the cost of maintenance is out of line with reality. I felt confident that the dealership could do the work faster and more efficiently than a private shop. True, but at what cost.  Expensive oil changes batteries and brake job are insane and you alway come ip with some up-sell that my wife would accept then have to mortgage the kids to pay for. 

I will sell this car and never consider Volvo again.  Burned the bridge ! ",2.4

They forgot to do this as well the time before but I noticed it that time before I left. It's a reminder I need. The new service people were friendly and helpful and it was nice being called by my name instead of sweetie as has happened before.

258,"November 24, 2018","Although very courteous, nice and easy to work with over the phone, everyone was very distant and uninvolved in person. I felt like I was at a completely different business. Most employees looked at me like they wondered what I was doing there. I saw no other customers but several well-dressed (salesmen?) men walking back and forth with a demeanor of ‘great importance’. Nobody spoke - maybe because I was in the “service” waiting area and not worth their time? Hmmm. I have a 2018 Volvo. 

Also, I guess they offer an exterior ‘wash’ with the service. That was a joke. Floorboards were not vacuumed and the back of the vehicle (XC90) was filthy from the overhang of the “spoiler” (?) over the rear window. As a Volvo dealership, you would think they would be aware that the area needs to be checked. I won’t be back. I’d rather drive to another Volvo dealership where they treat existing customers with courtesy and basic respect for service of any kind. I only rate the price as 5 stars because it was free standard service. ",2.8

281,"October 23, 2018",So my Jeep alerted me that my backup light and my blinker was out.  My husband took the the taillight apart and with a little finagling was able to make some of the bulbs come on.  Upon assessment of the connectors they appeared to have a ground short as indicated by arcing on the ground prong.  He left it unconnected to prevent further damage until I could take in to service center.  I arrived for appointment and explained what my husband had already assessed.  So the technician took my vehicle to the back to be looked at and since I have an extended warranty I guess they were seeing if a replacement was covered.  While I only had to wait an hour which was nice I basically ended paying 69.27 for something that was not correct and they may have made the problem worse by reconnecting every and leaving because now we can’t get it to work at all.  All I asked for was for them to tell me if this would be covered under warranty so they charged me 70$ to tell me that it wasn’t.  Also they could have checked with Jeep to see if it is covered under that warranty ,3.0

I didn’t think it was the battery and got to pay $69 to be told I was right. For whatever reason the car is starting now but I still don’t know what happened and I feel like I paid a good amount of money to be told something I already knew. I can’t say as I would recommend y’all at this point. For normal maintenance y’all are great but this is the second time I’ve had something weird happen and y’all couldnt figure it out. Last tome I drove to Austin and Mazda south figured it out right away and fixed it. So now I have to decide if I’m gonna wait and see if my car is just gonna not start again randomly or drive 6 hours in bad weather to go to a dealership that I know figures stuff out on the first try.

 I came to the dealer because I thought they had special experience and expertise in their particular brand of car and perhaps they do, but it didn’t show.  the second I walked in every employee I spoke to looked confused and had to go ask someone else the answer to my questions.  First they ordered the wrong part after I clearly told them several times exactly what it was I needed.  I also asked for a windshield repair several times and this fell completely on deaf ears until they returned my vehicle to me and blew me off by saying that I could contact a third party. Great.  overall their general incompotence put me and my family an entire day behind schedule, and then told me I needed to pay them an additional 1150 to get my ac fixed because the compressor wasn’t getting power from the battery and refused to buy the part back when I told them I didn’t have another day to burn away waiting for something that will probably never happen.

From the beginning to the end, Mears Mazda made this an awesome experience for her that she will never forget.  Mears Mazda knows how to take care of their customers!  

Thank you Judge - You are AWESOME!

402,"June 11, 2017","Best experience for the first time I have taken my vehicle for a service. I was given full discount as advertised including labor and they did the work on the same day. Quality of work is magnificent which installed right the first time. Bobby is excellent in his work and very adept in his hardware. He knows his stuff and can explain them in simple terms. Gets the guess work out of the equation.

Bruce from parts is also pleasant to deal with. Honest and straight to the point. ",5.0

409,"May 26, 2017","Our salesman, Judge, was excellent. We stopped in to look at a specific truck and took it for a test drive. We never buy on the spot and always take time to think about such a large purchase. There was no pressure from Judge. The truck was exactly what we were looking for. I called Judge after hours on his cell and received a call back within the hour. I expressed our desire to purchase the truck but wanted to have it checked out by our mechanic. The next morning the truck was fueled up and waiting for us. We had it inspected, came back and purchased the truck. Tom Evans arranged financing for us and was very nice and pleasant to do business with. All around a great experience.",5.0

I found this useful as I didn't have to wander around looking for the receptionist. Beau arranged all the details and provided several options on financing, trade in and the like.

439,"May 30, 2014",This is unequivocally the WORST Volvo dealership I have ever encountered. There is NO communication... ... there were so many inconsistencies with reports on the vehicle... they didn't even give me a formal list of work-to-be-potentially done to the vehicle. I left there frustrated and I was NOT what I expect of a Volvo dealership. Quality was zero and I would NEVER recommend wasting your time taking your vehicle there. Take it to a Dallas dealership if you can! If you care about your car and communication... forget Mears. Absolutely the worst.,1.2
440,"May 16, 2011","ABSOLUTELY, the worse place to have your car serviced! We are an active duty military couple &amp; veteran-our car had to be towed &amp; serviced by this place since, it was nearby in mileage. They did more harm than good after paying them in full for parts &amp; labor, we realized a few weeks later we had a major oil leak. I brought my car to another Volvo dealership for a 2nd expert opinion &amp; were all appalled by their findings! This dealership (James Mears Motors) had never replaced the parts, actually poked holes through the seal covers &amp; resealed them w/RTV! This followed w/ incorrectly changing out my Timing Belt. It was by the Grace of God, that we did not drive this car to our next duty station, as my engine would have been destroyed. This dealership does NOT live up to the motto of Volvo, &quot;Done right, the first time!&quot; I'm currently in a dispute w/this dealer &amp; due to the non-integrity of their service, I have not recieved a return call/comment from the GM. Please be advised!

When we made the deal I was verbally promised a second key to the car as well as touch up paint for a couple of nicks.  They said they did not have a second key at that moment, but would have one for us later.  Now as I wait for my car tags, I inquire about the second key and paint.  I am told they will not provide it and I can purchase one if I want.  Silly me, I took them at their word, my fault.  I am very disappointed with this situation.  As word of mouth steered me to their door, I will not hesitate to make people aware of their business practices. ",2.3
