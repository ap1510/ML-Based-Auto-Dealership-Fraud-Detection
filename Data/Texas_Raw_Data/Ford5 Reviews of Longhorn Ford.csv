0,"March 13, 2019","I’ve purchased vehicles from several different dealerships in East Texas. My past 5 vehicles have come from longhorn. (2017 Explorer,2017 F150,2018 F150,2018 Raptor and most recently a 2019 Raptor) They initially won my business when I went to them with a service issue and didn’t want to use the previous dealership I purchase that vehicle from. Charlie and Steve in service were awesome with getting the problem resolved and managed to get all the work warranted out so I wasn’t out of pocket. I was even provided with a loaner vehicle so I wasn’t without a mode of transportation. Shortly afterward I traded that vehicle in to them and had Jesse Ladd as my sales guy (who to this day continues to be) the process was so easy and efficient. They valued my trade in more than the surrounding dealerships and they were still cheaper on the vehicle I was trading in for than Tyler and Pegus Hurst. Where my trust for Longhorn really excelled was when I took one of the F150s in for warranty related work. Unfortunately one of the mechanics scratched up a part on the vehicle by accident. Instead of lying about it or not taking responsibility and blaming somebody else Charlie called me and told me about the situation and was upfront in admitting it was their fault and it would be taken care of immediately and make it right. When I got it back it was like it never happened. I use them for oil changes and so on. When I go to the dealership Charlie, Jeremy, Steve, Jauc and Jesse greet me by name and gladly strike up conversation which makes my patronage feel valued. As long as there is a Longhorn Ford and these guys are there. I will continue to purchase my vehicles from them. ",5.0
1,"November 28, 2018","On September 13, 2018, I purchased a 2017 Ford F-250 6.7 diesel truck from Longhorn Ford in Mineola, Texas.The following week I started having issues with the truck not cranking. I would have to make several attempts before it would crank.  I took the truck to the service department at Longhorn Ford and he said it sounded like an oil pressure issue.  He wanted me to leave truck with him so that he could check and see.  They did not have a loaner available at that time and I was told they would contact me to bring the truck back in to see what was wrong when a loaner was available. Two weeks later, I still had not received a call to bring the truck back in and exchange for a loaner. The truck continued having an issue with not cranking. On October 7, 2018 the truck would not crank at all.  After it still was not cranking on October 10, 2018, I had to have it towed into Ford Sam Pack in Lewisville.  The service man at Ford Sam Pack quickly found the issue and contacted Longhorn Ford. The Longhorn Ford service man sent Ford Sam Pack paperwork showing the truck that I purchased had had water in the fuel system and Longhorn Ford did not fully replace the fuel system, but only the fuel pump.  Had Longhorn Ford done a proper inspection, they would have found the rust as well and know that they needed to replace the whole fuel system, as Ford protocol states to do.  I have contacted the service manager at Longhorn Ford about this issue and continue to get the run around.  The service man from Ford Sam Pack in Lewisville called Longhorn's service manager to get further details and Longhorn Ford's service manager stated ""this is above my paygrade"" and also ""well he has insurance"".  This response was not appreciated.  This issue is due to Longhorn Ford not completing a job correctly, not from anything I did to the truck.Even after Longhorn Ford's service department verified that it did have water in the fuel system, they did not complete a full inspection that would have shown them that a full fuel system replacement was required and not just the fuel pump. Ford Sam Pack found rust in the valve and stated it needed a full fuel system replacement. Longhorn Ford's service manager offered to pay half of my insurance deductible (if covered) or reduce the full cost of repair to $8,000.00 rather than $10,000.00 - $12,000.00 if insurance doesn't cover it and I have to pay out of my pocket. Problem is insurance won’t touch the truck due to the issue being before i owner the truck. I found out who the previous owner was and contacted him about my issue.  I found out from him that when Longhorn Ford worked on the truck for this same issue, he said they replaced the fuel pump only and charged him $1,200 even though his truck was under warranty and he should not have had to pay for it. I have contacted the service manager and he says the employee who charged him is no longer here and he has no answer for why he was charged. I have contacted the service manager several times and this issue is still unresolved. I have also contacted the General Manager and she has forwarded my email and phone calls to the service manager at Longhorn Ford in Mineola. She has not even talked to me about this issue directly, she always puts me through to the service manager and I get the run around from him also. This is the kind of service I have received from Longhorn Ford in Mineola, Texas.  I still to this date, do not have my truck to drive because of this issue.",1.0

3,"May 17, 2018","Even though loaner cars are at dealer discretion, this particular dealership did not oblige to hand over a loaner car, or provide a ride home. They insisted that the party wait for several recalls to be completed on site, or have someone pick them up at the dealership. Even though it is at the discretion of the dealership to provide loaner cars, for the consumer it is at their discretion to do business with (or not to) and be able to leave negative feedback. Enjoy the feedback.",1.0
4,"February 08, 2011","Jeremy and the rest of the employees at Longhorn Ford were a God-send!  We had been trying so hard to get into a nice used Tahoe for 2 weeks, and all we dealt with is liars and people unwilling to work with us at other dealerships.  I contacted Jeremy through email on a Tuesday morning, and ended up buying an amazing Tahoe that evening.  I never knew that buying a car could be so easy!  Thank you for all of your help, and I will make sure to spread the word about you!",5.0
