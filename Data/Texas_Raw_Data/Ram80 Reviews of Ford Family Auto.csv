14,"August 28, 2019","Mr. Tanner Towery is still continuing to provide great service.  I love the Commerce area.  Good ol' East Texas country folks providing an honest service.  I was able to find the truck on line, call them, get financing and was set to pick-up the vehicle all with in a matter of an hour.  When I arrived at the dealership the signing of the paperwork took less than 30 mins.  I will check with Ford Family Auto to before I buy my next truck.  I love the service before and after the sale.  Mr. Tanner is the best.  Mr. Blake handled my paperwork and he made the process smooth and easy.  I could not say enough about these gentlemen and their team!  It is refreshing to see open and honest communication and a ""Non-pressure"" approach to selling vehicles.",4.8

18,"August 14, 2019","After spending countless hours at other dealerships only to leave frustrated and disappointed we found a truck at Ford Family Auto. As soon as I called and spoke with Tanner I could tell this was going to be a different experience! Upon arrival(after a 2 hour drive) the truck was sitting out front waiting for us and Tanner walked out to greet us. He was very friendly and knowledgeable but was willing so admit when he didnt know the answer. After driving the truck and deciding we wanted it they apprised our trade quickly and gave us a fair price. Finance took slightly longer for whatever reason, but from the time we pulled into the parking lot to the time we left in our new truck was about 3 hours(half the time we spent last time we bought a truck)! Never once were we talked down to, made to feel like we were stupid for asking for a price or part of the deal. I would 100% recommend Ford Family Auto, and plan on returning for our next vehicle.
