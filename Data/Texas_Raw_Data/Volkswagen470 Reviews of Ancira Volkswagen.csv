0,"February 05, 2020",Overall the worst experience of purchasing anything in my life. They promised me one vehicle and delivered a whole different vehicle to my PREVIOUS RESIDENCE. I had to track down a set of keys they mailed and they didn‚Äôt even have tracking on it nor required a signature. Their lack of communication is beyond unreal.  Anthony Staten and Javier Romero did not come through with anything they promised. ,1.0
1,"January 14, 2019","Vic. Nice guy.  Or I thought.  This was my second car from them.  Negotiations went smoothly.  They told me the price of my trade in and their car price. I don‚Äôt like wasting time so I gave them everything they asked for and took their offer on my trade-in.  My credit is xxxx good.  The finance guy proceeded to upsell me on several products.  One was gap insurance which I already have.  I kept telling him no and he kept insisting.  Anyways I walked out of there and called him a condescending ‚Äòpr1ck‚Äô when he kept insisting I had to buy.  Oh well.  Horrible customer service and horrible results, especially for a repeat customer.  Call me.  I‚Äôll fill you in.  More details.  Just buyer beware and take your time.  These guys are the epitome of ‚Äúxxxxxxxx car salesmen‚Äù. ",1.4
2,"January 10, 2019","This is Michael and Panida, we purchased. Tiguan SE 2018 in October 17, 2018. Tony Staten was our Sale Tepresentative and help us this second car we have purchased from this Ancira VW 6125 Bandera Rd San Antonio Tc 78238. The first was VW Golf Diesel 2013. We love it but then VW Emissions problems came through we had sold the car back to VW. Tony Staten was a very nice and kind person help us with respectful. But WHY now things has changed to disappointment with disrespect of integrity way of business. Tony offered us Tiguan SE 2018 with ON SALE price of $23,000. Then Michael Young processed all the financial paper worked after done for us to sign the price of the car was changed to the price of $28,000 of course of all tax, title, interest and all fee will plus up extra much more.

I said why Michael Young didn‚Äôt tell Tony Staten to inform us first before completed all financial after told us to take the car home. (We both were about to leave the country for long vacation to NZ and that was a long way)

Michael said due to our credit were poor so this is the price. We did put $13,000 for down payment. Please think and feel with good principles and integrity if we were so poor or sparkling credit what it have to do with the price of the car were/WERE ON SALE

It should be go by what we have to pay extra interest rate BUT WHY Michael Young intensional go up on the price of the car. Very well I‚Äôm sure Michael Young can answer all these to someone anyway one day when it come to the truth. I‚Äôm regret that I have trust this Ancira VW this time and operation not honesty this way. It‚Äôs very sad that we have to accepting this kind of treatment.",2.2
3,"May 31, 2018","I bought a base model Jetta S at the end of April.  I was pointed to a sales associate promptly.  Tony said he was pretty and he would only be able to help us for a few moments because he was busy.  I explained I wanted to buy a car now and he had a little more motivation.  As I was struggling to see if I qualified for a $500 off discount through my company, Tony said my company wasn't on the list for a discount, and I replied ""how do you know""?  He said his manager said so.  I asked how does he know?  He didn't have a response.  He wouldn't help me search the website to check, but was aware it existed.  I finally checked myself using my phone.  The next big issue was the financing department.  There are only two people to assist with financing and was lied to repeatedly about the time it would take to talk with someone.  About 3hrs later, Mike in the financing department talked with us about extended warranties.  I was coerced into purchasing an extended warranty, which i wanted to cancel at the last moment, but he wouldn't do it because he said it was ""already processed"".  This is before I signed the contract.  He also told me this was a VW extended warranty, but i found out it was through a 3rd party company.  I am still fighting to get my money after I had to call the company and cancel the warranty myself.  It took 3 emails over two weeks and multiple phone calls to get a response from Mike.  After 1 month of waiting, I am told it will take an additional 6-8 weeks.  He referred me to talk to the accounting people, which have not returned my calls.  Needless to say, i will never purchase a vehicle from this company again.  I am tempted to file a formal complaint with the BBB because they still owe me $2500 for a warranty i canceled over a month ago.  On the plus side, I am satisfied with the price I paid for the car.

4,"December 29, 2017","You are in great hands with Saleman Joe Mejia. This is my third buy from him because he cares about detail and customer service. His knowledge about every make of the car is astonishing. 

Thank you Joe!!",5.0
5,"October 11, 2017","Tony Staten and Javier Romero were absolutely amazing! As a first time buyer I went in on the defense and Tony helped me in every way possible! I was very appreciative that he was not ""pushy"" and was knowledgeable about the vehicles. He reassured he would take care of me and did just that...I highly recommend Mr. Staten if you are looking to purchase a new vehicle. This was a pleasant experience for me and I'm sure it will be for you as well. ",5.0
6,"August 18, 2017","TLDR: Never buy a car from Ancira Volkswagen.

I was referred to Ancira by a friend - he's now embarrassed to have made the recommendation and I now know which dealership in San Antonio never to do business with.

I requested information online about a vehicle I saw on Ancira's website and was referred to the ""internet sales"" team. The experience started out really pleasant. Internet Sales Manager, Emily, was responsive and friendly. I told her I lived several hours away and that if we could come to a verbal agreement, I'd happily drive the distance and purchase the car. She advised me to submit a credit application that same morning, which I did. She then referred me to one of her ""top salespeople"", Julian, and all seemed on track. From there, however, the process fell off the rails.

For the next three days, there must have been an internal struggle among the managers as to what to do with me. Their tactic, like all old-school car dealers is to bring you in, get you emotionally attached, and then pressure you to buy. I was outside-the-box in that they actually had to process an ""internet sale"" (why have an internet sales department if you can't process an internet sale?!), so clearly they weren't sure how to handle my situation. And in their defense, I'm sure they were worried I'd ""shop"" their price, but if they're so confident with their prices this shouldn't be a worry! 

So for three days they held on to my social security number and all my personal financial information, all without telling me anything. They kept asking the same questions over and over, making excuses about ""being really busy"" or needing to ""hear back from their manager"", all without simply quoting me a lease payment - something online dealers like Carvana do in 60 seconds. 

Eventually, I'd had enough - after three days you can't give me a simple answer? So I emailed Julian, copied the internet sales team, and respectively requested a conclusion to the matter asap.

And what did they do? After another ""I need to talk to my sales manager"" excuse, they came back with a low-ball offer on my trade ($3,000 less than the car valuation tool on their very own website) with the caveat that if I came in for a visit they would ""likely"" offer me what I was asking for my trade. And guess what their response was when I asked how much my lease payment would be without the trade? ""My sales manager doesn't think a lease would be a good idea in this case"". Haha... what a joke.

After wasting, now four days, of my time and turning over all of my financial information without even the courtesy of giving me a good faith quote, I now know to never buy a car at Ancira Volkswagen.

7,"August 14, 2017",I bought a 2017 Jetta and the process was so easy I thought I could only afford a 2016 Jetta but got a brand new Jetta instead and I love it!! Then I went to finance and thought I was going to end up spending more than I budgeted but ended up having my car payment than I thought!  So shout out to Mike Rosas!! Thanks for making my dreams come trueüòä,5.0

9,"March 22, 2017","I bought a new Golf from Marc, finally giving up on my 1997 Golf. He was very understanding and patient. He kindly walked me through the new ""gadgets"" on the new car...told me I could reach out to him with questions. As painful as a car payment is (none for 20 years), I am totally loving my brand new Golf. Thanks so much. Susan",5.0
10,"November 10, 2016","I live 150 miles away from this dealership and it was Absolutely worth the 3 hour drive. Marc Petersen reached out to me after I'd made some online inquiries looking for a specific Beetle. He treated me like a VIP from the very first phone call. He was very well prepared to answer every question I had and, when I told him the distance I'd have to travel, he immediately adjusted his schedule to accommodate me; that said volumes about his dedication and professionalism, and I knew immediately that my time would not be wasted. Marc greeted me the moment I walked in the door and already had my dream car prepped for showing. I was extremely impressed with how knowledgeable he was on the Beetle, he even taught me some tricks that was nowhere to be found on the how-to guides online! Marc understood my needs and priorities and got me an amazing deal, better than I'd hoped for! Less than 4 hours later, with all paperwork complete, I walked out the door with the keys to that Beetle in my hand, along with a sense of solid satisfaction that I would not have gotten better service anywhere else. Marc, and the Ancira Voikswagen Dealership family were, hands down, the most efficient team of consummate professionals I've ever dealt with at a dealership. Thank you for treating me like a VIP.",5.0
11,"October 04, 2016","My wife and I went to Ancira Volkswagen on Bandera for the issue we had with the new vehicle we bought couple of weeks ago and also wanted to see a another vehicle.   They were not opened so we were walking and looking around the lot.   As we were walking, the individual drove past us in a black RAM truck and he almost hit my wife in the lot.  He missed it by few inches, and he did not even stop and park his truck.  When I confronted with an excited voice, he said he was driving at 5MPH (but he drove past us at about 20-25mph) and he said to tone it down or leave the lot and kept walking.  I said that I will report to manager.  He replied I am the manager and I believe his name is Alvin.  He was disrespectful and he wasn't sorry for what he did.  He didn't care because he is a manager.  I do not respect this behavior.  I will not recommend this dealership only due to this Manger's behavior.  I have given one star only reason of the manger's behavior.  All other fellows are great and very helpful.  I also postpone of buying another vehicle due to his behavior. I might take my business somewhere else.  I'll also report this to VW.",2.2
12,"September 28, 2016","I went to Ancira Volkswagen on Bandera to see a vehicle I was interested in.  I  spoke with a very nice sales person who I think had nothing to do with what happened.  I  stopped in on Sunday to see a vehicle which I liked, told them I wanted the vehicle, but had a trade in and wouldn't be back until Wednesday or Thursday. They said Okay, we'll wait for you until then. I found out they sold the  vehicle that same day. I understand business is business,  but if that was the case tell me, I would have left a down payment to hold the vehicle.  Don't  tell me one thing and do another.  That's not good business, Mr. Ancira. ",1.0

14,"May 14, 2015",When I walked into the dealership nobody seemed to really work with me. The next day I got an email from mr.Lee and he was so helpful.

15,"March 24, 2015","This is continued from a previous review. I haven't had a chance to talk to the manager. I took my car in this past Wednesday because the car was shaking a little and I wanted them to check my tires to see if It was time to replace them since it is a 2013, but I purchaded it the end of Dec 2014, which means I've only had the vehicle 3 months. The man at Service, named Leroy assured me that he has been with Honda and Volkswagen for 38 years he would take care of everything. After waiting 4 hours just to check that out, Leroy assured me that I didn't need new tires I was good for another 5-10,000 miles. He said they balanced the 2 front tires and reset it since they put the correct air in the tires. I drove straight home after that. The next morning as soon as I took off to work the light for low tires went on, I immediately called Leroy and assured me there was nothing wrong with the tires, he said the mechanics said everything was fine, and apologized and asked if I could take the car in again and I said no because I got off work at 8pm. By the time lunch came around my tire was really low so I didn't drive it until it was time to go home. I put air in it and the next morning I took the car to Walmart since I work right next door and I had a nail at  the very edge of the tire that couldn't be replaced and a crack on the tire. If they removed the tire, it could burst open. I had a lady as well as another gentleman tell me the back tire was really bad and the other 2 tires were pretty worn as well. I had to go and purchase tires at Ssms immediately because my job involves driving. I specifically told Leroy I didn't want to do the tire balance if I needed new tires. Why was I going to pay for a tire balance at Volkswagen and at SAMs. They charged me 30.00 for absolutely nothing and wasting my time. I will never take my vehicle their again. Maybe the dealership is better but being an employee for so many years you think they would know how to check tires properly. Extremely disappointed in the gentleman that helped me. Still want to contact the manager.",2.6
16,"September 10, 2014",They had my car for a week then gave it back to me with the same problems + body damage. Also refused to honor warranty for one item. This place is less than 2 miles from my house which should be convenient but I'll never go there again for fear of what they'll do to my car next time!,2.0
17,"October 29, 2013","From the time I applied online to the time I drove away in my new car, Jay was nothing but helpful. He was patient, kind and very friendly. I would absolutely reccomend this dealership to friends and family. The service is impeccable and the professionalism flawless. I was extremely happy with the way things went and even happier with my new vehicle. They are my new go to guys for new vehicle in the future. Thanks Jay and Ancira!!

19,"October 22, 2013","After purchasing my car, I took it in to have it looked at as there was some concern with its performance.  24+ days later I'm still without a car and have made two car payments on a car I do not have .  Dealing with the service department to try to obtain any updates on my vehicle has also been a task as I've had to be the one to call each and every time to get my own updates rather than anyone calling me.  I've been passed from one contact person to another in hopes of getting some answers and have comminicated with all but one.  The quality of service, and the quality of this said to be ""new"" car has been nothing but problems and definitely the worst car buying experience I've ever had!  I've made sure to inform everyone I know of this experience as well as the method in which this situation was handled.  A month later, repairs are still incomplete and I still do not have the car that I purchased, yet am having to make payments on?!  
I do not reccomend this dealership to anyone",2.0
20,"October 14, 2013","My husband and I had an unexpectedly GREAT experience buying our vehicle. Our sales person Wes was very patient with us, he was NEVER pushy or over bearing. Did I mention that we were at the dealership on a Sunday, in the pouring rain for about 7 hours??? As we looked at numerous cars, IN THE RAIN...not once did Wes ever lose his smile or patience with us. He answered every question we had. 
The sales mgr  was great. My husband and I had a budget and the sales mgr made it happen for us. He was very positive and professional.
Next was on to financing with Bianca. She was terrific. They were no hidden fees and  no promises broken with our agreed price. 
These three people made my husband and I LIFE LONG customers with Ancira. 
Thank ya'll again so much for such an easy experience buying a vehicle, ya'll have exceeded our expectations!

24,"March 16, 2013","Just purchased my 6th VW, the third from Ancira VW. I've purchased other brands over the years from various dealers but the first thing that made my exprience great the first time and keeps me going back to this dealership was that they made me feel important much like the treatment at BMW or Mercedes. The entire staff makes one feel as if it's all about the customer from the reception, through sales, finance and service. Joe Mejia, Mark Villareal, Theresa Carpenter Odie Domingez are the names I remember unfortunately.  The sales have been honest and hassle free, the service dept. never disappoints. In the past I've hated the purchase routine, the back and forth of hours of haggling and the sales person doing their best to take me for a ride. Well Ancira VW make the customer's needs the focal point, plenty of honest communication that keeps the consumer informed and in mind years after a purchase. This place is like family, that's why my family keeps going back. Visit Anicira VW if you want ""Das Auto""",4.8

28,"December 31, 2012",I originally visited the dealership to have my '06 Jetta worked on. After I realized it more expensive to fix than it was currently worth I made the decision to trade it in. Zach was my sales man and was extremely helpful and patient with me (especially considering I did not start the day planning to buy a car). He explained my options and was understanding of my budget and did not try to push me into something I couldn't afford. We spoke through email and over the phone about what I wanted and he had options waiting for me as soon as I got there.

Recently I was contacted by Chris Brown about visiting Ancira for a 3 month check-up on my GLI.  Coincidentally, my GLI was having electrical issues, so Chris refered me to Odie Dominguez to scheudle an appointment.  Shortly thereafter I received a phone call from Odie and proceeded to take my car in for service.

Upon arrival I was promptly and couteously greeted.  Odie was extreemly professional and attentive, capturing all my concerns and ensureing me that he and his team would work diligently to identify and correct any issues.  I was supprised and very pleased to hear that he would push to get my car back to me by the end of the day, and that's exactly what happened.  

Odie and his team identified the problems (a bad battery and faulty strut mount) and corrected them.  I would like to thank Odie, not just for providing excellent service, but for the exemplary manner in which he handled our interactions.

It's not often that anyone looks forward to taking a vehicle in for repair, but I will say that Odie may this trip to the shop smooth and easy.  He is greatly appreciated.

Chris

I am pleased to write this review because our past experiences with new vehicle purchases have been very poor, but not this time. Kevin was very courteous and helpful. Kevin did everything possible to give us the successful purchase of exactly what we wanted and in a reasonable amount of time. We live in a small town, 65 miles from the dealership, but that didn't stop Kevin in trying to please us. He brought a Routan out so we could drive it,and after locating the exact Routan SEL we wanted, he delivered it to our home. We could not have expected more from Kevin or the dealership.  We are looking to a long future with Kevin and Ancira. I highly recommend new customers seek out Kevin to assist them with their purchase of a new or pre-owned vehicle.  You will not be disappointed. I have no doubt Kevin will go ""the extra mile"" to get as close to what you are wanting, and in reasonable time.

72,"November 28, 2012","Overall it was an ok experience. I understand that a dealer is there to sell a product to make money or he would not be in business very long. I have bought several new and used vehicles in the San Antonio area over the past 10 years from Jordan Ford and Ancira Volkswagen.
Charles Allbritton the salesman that I dealt with was a very friendly and curteous gentleman.
What I don't like is to have to haggle over pennies during a deal. When I go into a deanship it is not to look and price it is to purchase a vehicle and I hate dealing with all the different sales gimmicks that all dealers seem to offer. I walked into Jennings Anderson Ford a few years back and wanted to buy 2 ford trucks that day. the salesman blew me off and acted like he wasn't interested. I went to Jordan Ford the same day and purchased an F150 king ranch truck and paid cash for it and then bought an F250 along with it and paid 50% of it at the same time. Like I say when I get ready to buy I am ready to buy. I do not want to haggle over pennies. That is my only complaint about my deal with Ancira Volkswagen that day I purchased the Volkswagen Jetta and paid cash . It seemed that Charles had to keep going to his manager and we haggled over pennies.  I was about ready to walk out on this deal.
What takes me back to Jordan Ford is the service after I have purchased a new and used vehicle. Some of the service people over the past few years know who I am when I come in and take good care of me. That wins my repeat business over the long haul.
I only hope that Ancira Volkswagen will have the service that I like in order to keep my business.

Thanks and Regards,
Donnie Allbritton",3.2

I had a couple of visits for regular schedule service and I was not completely satisfied because my car was having a nagging problem with the A/C since I got my brand new vehicle in 2007. This A/C problem was so bad that the a dealership in Houston replaced my whole a/c system just to get me out of their store.

The problem continue and it was then  when I took my vehicle back to Ancira and I met Mr. Ariel and he took a good look of the problem that has been seen since I got the car (and after an a/c replacement in Houston).  Mr. Ariel took time to listen to my description of the problem, and asked me to leave my vehicle to see what the problem was.

A day later he called me to tell me what the problem was and he fixed it!  The same problem that I had been complaining for the last 5 years PLUS a new A/C would not fix!

I know first hand that mechanics don't listen to females as they would listen to a man.  Mr. Ariel changed that for me.  I know that if I have a problem he will listen and he will fix the problem.

Please congratulate Mr. Ariel Hernandez for having the amazing talent to listen to customer and take his time to solve that problem.

I was very impressed with the depth of his knowledge as well ability to explain certain aspects of the points of sales with respect.

Dealing with the finance department was fast and easy as well, they had everything ready and I was in and out of the dealership with my new car in less than 2 hours. I would recommend this dealership and Chris to anyone looking for a great deal and great service.

He is honest and fair. I never feel like I'm being duped on the price. Dealerships are notorious for being way overpriced but I actually never feel like I overpaid for service.

215,"September 14, 2012","Michael and Odie were very professional and very good customer service. Michael came out and told me what was going to happen with the car and the shuttle will give me a rise once arrived, but was necessary because the car got fix. I did haved to go ask about the car because Michael never came back after an hour of waiting. Odie then helped me with getting me checkout, explaing what had been done on the car, and the extended warranty that can be purchased. He then told that the car was being wash. He even went out and check to see if it was done. Odie was the one who cameout with the car and even went out and gave it a buff where it has a bad scratch. It helped a lot because you can barely see it. He never lost his smile that he has when talking. That is a man who enjoys being with the public. He is a person that every business should have.

217,"September 13, 2012","We have recently been having issues with taking our care out of park and finally opted to take it to the dealership. Turns out it was a cracked battery that was leaking battery acid on our shifting cable! The battery was six months old or so and was purchased from an auto-parts store. It was a weird situation, but Ancira diagnosed it quickly, were right on the money with how much it would cost, and called us to let us know the car was ready.

I know that last part seems obvious, but nearly every other auto repair experience is such that I am always the one calling for an update. Ancira actually does it the other way around (the way it should be).

Lately, their customer service has improved noticeably. We have worked with Teresa a few times now and, prior to her, Ancira would seem to rotate through customer service repair folks. Of them Teresa has been the most helpful for us.

The only downside to Ancira, and the reason we didn't buy and install a new battery for us (instead of buying one from an auto-parts store) was because I thought it would be easy like most other cars. VW makes it more difficult. But mostly the reason is time. Ancira doesn't have same-day turn-around and that can sometimes be a hassle.

A hassle, however, we are discovering more and more is well worth it.",4.2

Furthermore, the staff and our salesman (Tony Staten) were knowledgeable and patient with us and made sure that all of our questions and concerns were answered.   We looked at multiple dealerships prior to making a decision and Ancira VW was the only one that did not try to sell us a car on the spot that day.  They recognized that buying a car is a big decision that does not need to be taken lightly and wanted to ensure that the car we purchased was the right make and model to fit our family's needs.

291,"August 02, 2012",I shopped around at many other dealerships before going to Ancira. I told Rudy what I wanted to look at and explained exactly what I wanted to do. I was trading a vehicle and using a V.A. grant to purchase a vehicle and did not want any payments. Rudy showed me the two vehicles on the lot that where the make/ model that I was looking for. We test drove it and i decided to go ahead and buy it. At every other dealership they tried to get me to buy a new vehicle and finance and didn't care about what I wanted or had told them. Rudy and the team at Ancira Volkswagon helped me get everything I wanted without trying to push other vehicles on me. They were very friendly and very fast. I will definatley be coming back to see him again when I am in the market for a new car.,5.0

As far as my rating on the price, well you know nobody wants to spend so much money, but the job needed to be done and it was done extremely well!  Please do not ever let Odie leave and if a shop is ever opened in Laredo, send him this way!  Thank you so much for a wonderful experience.

303,"July 26, 2012","The only great thing about our experience is that they worked with us on the price, and we truly did get a great price on the vehicle, driving from Houston as it was much worth it. (The car and specs we wanted were very specific, and it was a harder to find color, ect) 

After that however, is when the issues came up. We settled on the price of the car and complete OUT THE DOOR price as well, however when we were in the financing office, we ran into several issues. We were approved for 0% APR and applied online through VW Credit. We arrived at the dealership and Victor our sales guy greeted us, he had to go get the paperwork together (which we felt should of been ready for us as he knew we were going to be there first thing Sunday morning, we've discussed this) and that took some time. We filled out the paperwork, and questioned filling out a credit application again, Victor informed us that they needed a hard copy for their records and that our credit would not be pulled again, and trusted their process with VW Credit and their dealership. 

We got all the paperwork filled out, wasn't that bad...and waited around a bit and then went into the financing office. This is where we had SEVERAL problems! 

The first issue was that they switched financing on us, with their in-house credit union, and that it was not 0%. We caught this mistake right away, informed them and then afterwards they seemed they were not aware of the 0% offer from VW Credit which we were taking advantage of, and wrote it up at 1.9% (that was the 2nd set of papers) we had to get a manager involved and he confirm with Victor, our sales person on the offer that we discussed. We finally got it changed over, and were on our 3rd set of paperwork... we were going through the numbers and they were not matching up to what we had calculated before we even got the dealership, they changed their pricing in the VIN Etching fee, and few other Out The Door Fees, we had to have these adjusted and then were on our 4th set of printed out paperwork (the long sales sheets of everything, it all had to be done 4 (FOUR) times!! Most people would not even read and review these numbers, they just sign, and that is why people get screwed, we had to call out many of the finance persons errors. Before we left home, we had calculated out all the numbers, TTL, monthly payment, selling price, and everything so that we would know and it would match the dealership. They tried to throw in extended warranties and GAP (which is understood, all dealerships will do this) but we declined all that, which they didn't press hard to add those thankfully. 

Once we got all that taken care of and finally agreed that things were right, we were ready to take acceptance of the vehicle. When placing the temp registration sticker on the car, we realized the last name was spelled wrong, they said it's changed on the other paperwork and that it would be ""Okay"" however we insisted on having them reprint it before we left, that took some time and seemed a bit difficult than it should of been. 

It was two (2) days later when the real frustration occurred. We received an email from our Credit Report Monitoring Company stating that a new inquiry is on our report.  We logged in and checked to see what it was, and there was an inquiry from ""ANCIRA VW"" along with the one we assumed and approve of ""VW CREDIT"". ANCIRA ran our credit on top of already having approval from VW for the vehicle. We were furious as this did not need to happen, and it was an unnecessary pull on our credit.  

We sent our salesman, Victor, and email regarding our experience and concerns. We felt that our credit was pulled under false pretense and asked to have the inquiry removed. Victor called us and said that he forwarded the email we went to management. We received a call from a manager to address this issue. 

The manager just brushed this issue off, and when confronted about it further, and how  we wanted them to reverse it, and will report them regarding this, he said that he has a signed form proving they could pull the credit. Yes, true...but, we were told it would not be pulled, and it was for their records, as they had to have a hard copy of the credit application that we filled out for VW Credit.

Overall experience was not great, and the customer service after regarding the credit issue was nonexistent. We again however did receive the price we wanted, and they worked with us on that, not a penny more, but after we agreed on it, once we got there, they did try to increase it with this and that. 

With all dealerships, read your numbers, review your terms, everyone makes mistakes, but they made several, which would of cost us our 0% financing, and also to have it with VW Credit, we would of been using their lender, and who knows what interest rate, ect. It happens everyday to many people, protect yourself.

I can't say enough about how great the team at the Ancira Bandera Rd dealership was. The GM Darrell Dixon was walking around greeting everyone and was extremely pleasant and helpful. I was set up with Chris Brown as my dealer. Honestly, he made the entire process actually fun and painless. Best of all, he listened to me and worked hard to get me the car and deal I wanted. No wonder this guy has a wall full of awards! From checking out the cars with Chris to the helpful finance representative, I was in and out in no time!

I would recommend Ancira Volkswagen to any of my friends and colleagues and specially to my family. I always wondered if they were as nice as they seem on their commercials, well, now I know...they are even nicer!

Thank you to everyone at Ancira for a wonderful shopping experience. You have a new loyal customer.

I also sincerely appreciate the way that Ancira does business.  By this I mean that when you come onto the lot, you aren't mobbed by 20 sales people before you get out of your car & you don't know how much that upsets me, as well as most people.  I truly appreciate the professionalism that Ancira portrays as far as the initial meeting with a sales person.  This wasn't my first time onto the lot, but this was the first time that I purchased a vehicle there.  The main reason that I came back to purchase a vehicle there was because of the forementioned reason.

So, I pulled up in front of the building, got out & looked into the building as to say, ""alright, I'm ready for a sales person now.

Each team member at Ancira VW was great and they really are there to please you and help you out when purchasing a new vehicle.  Rudy was very knowledgable and answered all my questions and explained everything very clearly when I didn't understand.  I really appreciate everything that he did as well as the team in getting me a new vehicle and also buying my old vehicle at a good price.  Thank you to everyone, and I would highly recommend not only a VW to friends and family, but also purchasing from Ancira VW here in San Antonio.  ",5.0

Chris was extremly patient with us and worked with us to get a price we could feel comfortable with. The thing I liked the most about him was from the very first time we met with him he didn't try to get us to buy right then (he wasn't pushy). We had been to other dealerships the day before and all they wanted was to sell that day, and were impatient and annoyed when we told them we didn't want to purchase right away. Chris was great. He gave us his full attention, didn't get annoyed when we told him we couldn't buy right away and was happy to show us multiple cars. I would definately recommend Chris to anyone who is looking to purchase a VW.",5.0

414,"October 25, 2011","My wife and I spent last Saturday visiting various make dealerships in the San Antonio area looking for a new mid-sized sedan for my daily commute to Austin.  After visiting the other sales lots, we went to Ancira VW on Bandera Road in San Antonio.  Unknown to us, Ancira VW was closed due to the Texas Blue laws which requires dealerships to be closed one day each week.  Since we'd driven from our home 60 miles from Ancira, we decided to look at the VW Jetta's on the lot.  We found the exact vehicle we were looking for on the lot for far less than a similar vehicle on another VW dealership in SA.  As my son had purchased a GTI from Ancira, I called him to discuss his experience with Ancira VW during his purchase.  My son opined it was the best vehicle purchase experience he'd ever had and recommended I deal with Salesman Chris Brown.  

We returned home and searched Ancira VW's website and discovered the Jetta we were interested in purchasing was actually $1300 less than the vehicle sticker price we'd seen on the lot.  At this point, I ""Chatted"" with the online assistance and requested a message be sent to Chris Brown asking him to contact me to purchase the Jetta on ther dealership lot.  

The next morning, I received a call from another salesperson at Ancira to advise me Chris Brown was with another scheduled customer and asked to assist me.  I advised I wished to purchase the Jetta on the lot; that I would be bringing a trade; and did not have very much time to complete the transaction.  The salesperson advised me she would send me a credit application and have Chris Brown call me.

The credit application came via email and I completed the form.  Within seconds my application was approved and Chris called me on the phone to discuss the sale.  I informed Chris that I could not spend hours waiting at the dealership to complete the transaction as I had other appointments to deal with later in the day.  Chris was very sincere and professional; obtained information on my trade-in; and promised to complete the transaction as quickly as possible without the usual delays.

I drove to Ancira VW in my trade-in and met Chris Brown in person.  Chris greeted me and had already pulled the keys to the Jetta based upon my message from Saturday.  Chris was very easy to deal with and understood my time restraints.  After reviewing the Jetta and equipment, we quickly completed a few short forms while my trade-in was appraised for the transaction.  After completing the appraisal, Chris met with the sales manager to produce the transaction offer.  When Chris returned I was very happy with the appraisal and an even lower sales price for the Jetta.  I'd searched dealer pricing on-line and knew the sales price was several hundred dollars below the great pricing line listed for similar Jetta's.  After accepting the deal, Chris ensured the vehicle was prepared and ensured the financing when smoothly and quickly.

All told from start to finish, the complete transaction took just about 90 minutes from the time I arrived at the dealership.  The sales price was far below the prices I'd found at other dealerships/online and the service was exactly wahat was promised and needed!

I would definately recommend Ancira VW for your purchase and make sure you ask for Chris Brown, I promise you won't be disappointed!",5.0

423,"October 03, 2011","Mark Villareal did an excellent job in the overall sale of the 2012 Jetta. He was patient and not aggressive. Explained both the Jetta and new Passat's capabilities very well. He searched for the vehicle we wanted - model, color, ect., and did not push just to buy one of the lot. When our Jetta was brought to us Mark took the extra time to explain every detail of the car and how to operate all the features - most salesperson will just say here is the car and call me if you have any questions. 

GREAT Job Mark!!!!!!

Javier in Finance was also very friendly and was fast/efficient in processing the finance forms. 

The Dealership was very clean inside and outside and all employees were friendly.

I had previously done an internet search and identified the exact features I was looking for. Jay took me serious, and worked with me over the phone to make the deal. All I had to do was arrange a visit. Jay took the time with me and explained the car very well and made me feel comfortable. There was never any pressure. I also noticed the other folks on the sales staff were very friendly and willing to answer questions as well.

429,"July 09, 2011","I have been shopping for a new car for a while and had already visited a number of dealerships.  I decided to check out Ancira's Volkswagen dealership.  I started my shopping experience online and was called by a representative from the dealership before the 2nd navigation page on my internet program even had a chance to load.  I went in and had the pleasure of working with Anthony Staten.  I am normally cynical and apprehensive about car salesmen but when I found out that Anthony was a minister in his church I was immediately put at ease.  He proved to be extremely honest and by far the best car salesman I have interacted with.  I was very pleased with the service and the price I got on my vehicle.  I strongly recommend buying your next Volkswagen from Ancira and Anthony!

431,"June 22, 2011","My wife and I recently purchased a 2011 Golf TDI from Ancira Volkswagen. In fact we drove 2 hours out of our way because the dealerships in our area just couldn't match the savings, and frankly they couldn't match the customer service either. All the anxiety that usually comes with buying a new vehicle was literally non-existent at this dealership. In all honesty, we kept waiting for a catch but it never came. The customer service presented to us by Marcey, the internet consultant, Charles from sales, and Mike from financing was extremely professional and friendly. Charles even came in on his day off to see that we were well taken care of, and Marcey kept in contact with us on the trip down which was unexpected. Even upon meeting the service manager there was no end to the courtesy at Ancira Volkswagen. The experience was so beyond our expectations that we may make the trip down to complete the future servicing on our new Golf. All in all, this had to have been the best decision we could have made. I would highly recommend Ancira Volkswagen to anyone looking to be treated with quite possibly the best customer service available. ",5.0

I have always been careful when purchasing used cars but after an inspection and test drive of the Solara I knew that this was a good buy.

There was no hard pressure sales and he understood I would come back in about an hour(as i said i would) to talk with him a bit more about what he could offer and take a ""test drive"". He was patient and listendd to what I had to say.. concerns and price. The other car had much less  miles, but the dealer would not make minor repairs. Ancira team stepped up to the plate, did the repairs and provided a loaner car for as long as the Beetle had to be in the shop.I talked with Euopean auto and took their advice. Rudy had confidence he could provide a better deal if given the chance. He did not bad mouth another dealer which is always a sign of integrity. He simply wanted me to give him and Ancira team an opportunity to look at the Beetle. Rudy offered to drive the new Beetle home which is unheard of in used car sales. When I was stranded at Atlas who refused to return my deposit, Rudy drove to Atlas to pick me up. He went above just salesmanship. He  wanted me to come back as a satisfied cutsomer. I asked for a smallprice adjustment and it was granted.At detailing, it was discovered the windshield had a 12 inch long crack. Neither Rudy nor I had noticed the crack at ""test drive."" Ancira, did not have to replace the windshield, but Rudy approached the manager on my behalf and the repairs were done. I noticed some dash imperfectionss and went to the parts dept to order parts and was greeted with ""how can I help you"" I ordered the parts without any problem. The Ancira team from salesman to parts exhibited a willingess to provide superior service. As a used car there are always some imperfections, but Ancira went beyond anything I could have expected to replace a windshield and  new car home delivery. Rudy and the Ancira repair team, finance team offered to work around my unorthodox work schedule to complete the repiars and the deal in a swift and completet manner.

446,"June 24, 2010","Overall, our experience at Ancira Volkswagen was very good and we would recommend the dealership, as well Marcos Viera, to others.  

I would rate the Overall Experience as a ""4"" for the same reason that I would rate Customer Service as a ""4"".  Although it may seem petty, we were very disappointed to drive away from the dealership with an almost empty tank.  We purchased the car around 5:30 in the evening but apparently at 5:30 or 6:00 the gas tanks had been locked up.  Although Marcos offered us a free tank when we returned, it would be highly unlikely that we would drive over to fill up a gas tank when we live 65-70 miles away.  After my son and I ran a few quick errands and had dinner, we left town but, of course, had to stop on our return home to fill up the tank.  It was a bit of a nuisance to try to read the car manual in the dark to not only determine how to open the fuel door but how to first turn on the interior lights so that we could read the manual.  Obviously, we could have opened the doors to illuminate the car but that wasn't really a safe option.  In my opinion, a small gesture on the part of Ancira to fill up the tank elsewhere would have diverted an imposition for us that evening and would have made the transaction much more enjoyable.

452,"March 30, 2010","We recently purchased a convertible here.  

The car had a couple of problems with it (scratches, damaged buttons, cleaning) when we bought it that we caught and so we arranged to have those fixed as part of the purchasing contract.  So we drove back and forth a couple of times to get these things fixed.

It was a week or so before we got the windscreen out to use with the top down.  When we got it out, we found that the frame was broken in two and the screen was coming undone from the frame.  These windscreens cost around $650.  We immediately called the dealership and spoke with Chaz ""Big Red"", the salesman who sold us our car.  He said that they would replace it.  

Long story short, After a year of being runaround with this salesperson we decided to get a hold of someone higher up.  I spoke with Darrell Dixon, VP and General Manager.  Mr. Dixon was very forthright and explained the situation to me and why there was some misunderstanding.  Basically the problem was with this single salesperson who no longer works there.  Mr. Dixon did everything he could to make things right and live up to the promises this salesperson made.  

I really appreciate the way our situation was finally resolved, and based upon our dealings with Mr. Dixon we would look into buying another vehicle at Ancira.

Ivan goes to take what my counter offer is.  Suddenly another guy shows up with my papers and acts like he his shocked that I counter offered.
