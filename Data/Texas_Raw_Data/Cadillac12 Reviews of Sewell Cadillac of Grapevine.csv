0,"June 01, 2020","I have after market warranty.  The company paid thousands of dollars to replace the shocks 16 months ago.   I’ve taken the SUV back 3 times.  That 4 total times in 16 months for these shocks that are supposed to be new.  The SUV has genuine GMC parts.  My warranty went out.   They won’t replace the shocks that they put on because the warranty had them shipped to the dealership.  Which I didn’t know. Nevertheless, I have taken this truck back on 3 different occasions over 16 months because they weren’t working properly   And now Sewell wants to charge me for new shocks.   I talked to the manager (Bobby) and he’s giving me all of these scenarios trying to reason with me like a child in explaining why they won’t fix the genuine GMC parts that has never really worked in the first place. Saying they dont have the receipt for the shocks being bought.  So they cant replace them.  His hands are tied.  He didn’t even try.  Smh. This is senseless and unprofessional for a Cadillac dealership with the name Sewell to behave in this manner. So watch your backs when you’re getting your car serviced there. ",1.6
1,"February 19, 2019",My car has been in this shop 4 time for engine light. Now they say the the warranty will not fix it because my car was in an accident. But there are not scratches or dents or any physical evidence of a wreck.   Never trust Sewell.  They are great while buying a car but not when fixing one.,1.8
2,"November 17, 2018","We purchased a XT4 from Sewell Cadillac Grapevine on Oct 31, 2018. We love our new vehicle but would like to warn people to be leary of financing through the this dealership. We had been approved for a loan before we purchased our vehicle but Brett convinced us to use their financing that would run our credit once but would look at 12 vendors. We were given a horrible interest rate that was 1.5 pts higher than we could have gotten on our own. The disappointing part was the fact that we called less than 12 hrs later to question the rate and did not receive a call back until the second business day after and we were told nothing could be done. We found a refi within 6 hrs which will save us money but cost us time. The even more disappointing factor was receiving NO response or acknowledgement from Justin Nichols, General Manager when we expressed our concern. We have always wanted to have the Sewell experience but won't do it again unless our future encounters are more positive. I would also suggest ignoring the reply your negative posts will receive since it is apparently a waste of time and Mr Nichols administrative assistant's standard response to the many negative reviews.",1.0
3,"August 27, 2018","There is NOTHING exceptional about the whole ""Sewell"" experiance. Purchased a pre-owned vehicle from this dealership - the entire experiace was the same as a root canal. First problem was - their business policy will not allow you to put down a down payment using a credit card - ""if"" you've secured your financing through the dealership. I've typically purchased both pre-owned vehicles & new vehicles all across the DFW area & never heard of this type of stupid policy. Went out - secured my own financing & purchased the vehicle & then they were perfectly happy to take my credit card as a down payment. & the entire ""Sewell"" experiance doesn't stop there - nope - vehicle had a fog light which appeared to be bent out of place - asked if the wouldn't mind aligning it - nope - flat out refused to even look at it - this is supposed to be ""exceptional"" customer service - more like (fill in the blank) service. The did supply two lovely new floor mats - totally the wrong color - because the RIGHT ones retail for a additional $20 more - I'm sure the whole sale difference is like $5 ...

So ... YA - FAIL - @ the whole Sewell Customer experiance - the true reason I even put up with all this nonsense is - they had a vehicle which I spent a month looking for & really wanted - also - due to medical reasons - will only be able to enjoy for a limited time. 

In conclusion - totally & completely not impressed with Sewell Cadillac of Grapevine ...",3.0
4,"March 31, 2018","I took my truck to Sewell  Cadillac in Grapevine on 3/28/18 for a basic oil change.  I arrived at my scheduled appointment. T hey took my truck and an hour later came and told me that my brakes were completely out.  I was told that my staring shaft was bent and it cut my brake line and would cost $1800 to repair.  When I asked how could that happen and what would cause my staring shaft to bend.  They stated that something must have hit it.  I told them that I have not hit or run over anything.  This truck has never been in any accident.  There was no evident of any leaks.  Not even when I pulled up to their bay.  So from the time they pulled truck from their bay into their shop, the brakes went completely out and they could not stop.  My question is, that if the brakes were a problem when they first drove it into the shop, why didn't they come tell me then.  Why wait over an hour to inform me that something was wrong. When I questioned them about my concern, they became defensive. I was told that I could either fix it or have it towed out.  This is the second time taking my truck in for one service and having something else go wrong while in their shop.",1.0
5,"March 03, 2017","You only need to know two words when you go to this dealership. SAM SMITH. My wife and I have bought 39 cars in our 42 years of marriage and we actually enjoyed this purchase experience more than any we can recall. Sam was amazing from start to finish. We were treated very respectfully. We were not passed from one person to another. Sam took ownership of the entire transaction and did it all with ease. We found out that Sam has been selling cars for a long time and his experience shows. There is a reason why he has been top salesman and rated the highest salesman in customer satisfaction. Sam went the extra mile to make sure we were completely satisfied. I just wish we would have found him years ago! My advice is that if you are really interested in a car at SEWELL, ask for the BEST! SAM SMITH! You will not be disappointed! Oh, by the way, Sam put us in a 2017 Cadillac XT5 that only has 6K miles on it at a fantastic savings! ",5.0
6,"November 05, 2016",We went in to look at used automobiles and found something I've been wanting for a very long time. (not what I went to look at) The salesman was excellent and made everything go much quicker than other places we've purchased from. They were about to close but he stayed to help us not knowing if we would purchase or not. We did because of the dealership service we received. Very nice people and went beyond to get something extra for my car. Thank you Marcelino Orellana,5.0

8,"March 22, 2015","This was the best car buying experience I've ever had.  Brandon was great, we came from Austin to buy and everything he promised over the phone he did.  The process was quick and we were back on the road quickly in my new ATS coupe.  Thank you Brandon, you're the best!",5.0
9,"September 09, 2014","I was going to purchase another Cadillac from Sewell Cadillac of Grapevine.  I purchased my last one from them so I was going to do the same.   Well I worked with the same salesman from my first purchase.  The whole experience was sorry and they were unwilling to negotiate or even TRY to assist me with my purchase.  In fact I felt as if I was a burden and the salesman, Darren couldn't wait to be gone with me.

Well, I went to another dealership and purchased a 2014 vehicle.  The other dealership was totally awesome and they appreciated me as a customer.  

Sewell - Grapevine KISS my GRITS!!!

I may be a woman but I too have purchasing power!! It not just men you need to cater too!",1.0
10,"September 13, 2009","Normally visiting a car dealership is like visiting a dentist. You hate to go and it is a real pain. This team is just the opposite. They are courteous, helpful and efficient. I have been in there several times and they not only take care of the reason for my visit but also check everything else out. And not because they want to charge me more. 
It is a real pleasure to do business with them. I will have all my service done here and will continue to buy my cars from them. I trust them which is not a word typically associated with this industry.

11,"August 21, 2009",The salesperson was very helpful in finding what I wanted at the price I wanted to pay.  Everyone was extremely freindly and the buying experience very enjoyable.  The quality of work was very good in all aspects of the experience.  I enjoyed the experience I would use Sewell Grapevine the next time I am in the market for a new or used car.,5.0
