530,0,18-Dec-19,"I purchased an pre owned vehicle from the dealership in which was an lemon. My salesman James Haas was not very helpful during the purchase process ,his customer service was horrible. The starter went out on the vehicle two days after purchased. Within the next few days I noticed the vehicle started running hot and the heater stopped working. I took the vehicle to an repair auto shop an was advised the vehicle needed an radiator and thermostat. I spoke with manager Scott Vo who advised to bring the vehicle back out there to have it checked out. I took the vehicle back out to the dealership and which it stayed at the dealership for one week and I was told the vehicle only needed for the coolant to be flushed. So I went to pick up the vehicle and noticed the same issue vehicle running hot and no heater. The service department did nothing at all to make sure that my vehicle was truly repaired before returning the vehicle.  I then took the vehicle back to the repair shop and had the radiator and thermostat replaced and was told by the auto shop stop leak was added to the vehicle. The stop leak added to my vehicle prior to the purchase has totally messed up my vehicle. I have called and requested to speak with an General manager several times with no return call. I will not be recommending this dealership in the future. Do not purchase an vehicle from this dealership. The entire experience has been absolutely horrible. ",1,1,0,0
531,1,17-Nov-19,"Oh how I wish I could give 0 stars. This place is utter garbage. They lie straight to your face, they use every shady sales practice in the used car sales book, and specifically Eric is a terrible person. He sold a car right out from under me while I was on my way to buy it just because he would get the sale faster, even though I was promised it was on hold after giving them my debit card info to put a deposit down on the vehicle. Do not give this place the time of day much less your business. They are crooked and disgusting. Their ineptitude knows no bounds.",1,1,0,0
532,2,30-Sep-19,"Probably the worst car buying experience we’ve had so far. Used car sale and finance were time consuming and honesty was out the window. 

Also, we came from out of state to buy the car and was told after a whole month of waiting for the paperwork, it would take 4-6 weeks! Completely out of the norm here. My state only allow 30 days to register or late fees will apply. Left messages asking for a return call on this matter and got nothing. ",1,1,0,0
533,3,23-Aug-19,I purchased a vehicle in Dec. 2017. I experience issues with the turbo charger. I took the vehicle for warranty repairs in Sept. 2018 and it was returned in February of 2019. I reported an oil leak to Hiley on the newly installed engine hat Hiley replaced due to a mechanics error; I returned the vehicle for repairs and four months later I still don't have mr vehicle. The service department will not take my calls. They just ignore me. I would not advise anyone to do business with Hiley. ,1,1,0,0
534,4,30-Jun-19,Worst waste of time buying experience ever. They refused to let me take the vehicle to be inspected by my mechanic until I signed all the final paperwork to purchase it. Unbelievable! I was told they would let me out of the deal if my mechanic found problems. When I asked them to sign a document to back up what they said... they refused. Ended up walking away from the deal. Buyers beware.,1,1,0,0
535,5,02-Jun-19,Totally liar and dishonesty. They have agreed with the OTD price but turned 360 degree on the next day. I almost purchase the car at the other dealer and they text me nonstop and asked me to give them a chance to beat other dealer.....,1,1,0,0

I just received this email from Austin Doyle today.  Apparently he is super professional and will have a long career in sales:

Frank, 

I see you opened my 'please take 10 seconds to respond' email and then...didn't respond. Making the world a better place one read email at a time!

537,7,10-Apr-19,"I would NEVER buy from Hiley Acura again. Purchased a used vehicle on December 31. We were told that it would be ready in a few days to pickup. It was over a MONTH later that we were able to pick up the car. It was not even close to having all of the items completed. Since the dealership is an hour away, I was told that I could take it that day and call them in a week or so to bring it back in to have the rest of the items completed. Seeing how I had already been waiting a month for my car, I took that day. BIG mistake. My husband and I have been calling, texting, and emailing every person that we can at Hiley with NO response or ""so and so will contact you in just a minute."" Recently, they said they weren't even sure if they would still be fixing the rest of the items. That we would need to pay for some of the repairs that were promised at purchase. I STILL don't have my license or registration. They won't even schedule for us to come pick them up. Again, it's an HOUR away, so I don't want to drive an hour there and back to not be able to get anything. DO NOT BUY FROM HILEY ACURA!!!!!",1,1,0,0
538,8,21-Mar-19,"So I purchased a 2015 TLX from this location, i soon started to notice a couple of stuff that weren’t really noticeable  at the lot. Chipped paint, chipped plastic, I shrugged it off and said my fault for not looking and it’s a used car. BUT they add an incredibly high fee to ensure the car comes out the lot in good conditions and that includes oil and filters. Fast forwarding 2 months later when I’m getting ready to do my first oil change, I noticed the filters and oil were in terrible conditions and hadn’t been changed In a very long time. They charged me a $1,500+ fee for nothing. They did nothing to my car. They Make your car look good enough to drive off the lot and care about nothing else. I’ve tried to reach out and no answer . Don’t come to this location",1,1,0,0
539,9,13-Mar-19,"I bought this vehicle about a week and half ago. It seemed solid at the dealership. So far no serious problems with the engine, drive train, etc., BUT....I've begun to realize that a great number of plastic pieces on the vehicle were broken that weren't obvious on the lot. For example, a Mopar air intake had been installed by the previous owners. 

What was not obvious at the time I bought it was that the previous owner had managed to break the plastic clip that holds the air temperature intake circuit. It was just hanging there. I found this out because my check engine light came on and, after looking into it, found that it had come unplugged. Simple fix, but annoying. The hood prop clip that holds the bar in place - broken. On the driver's side, under the dashboard, the plug you use to pull codes had its bracket that holds it in place broken. Interior door trim - now falling off. ""After market black matte wheels"" turned out to be plastidipped. Again, so far (and I pray to The Lord above it's ONLY these minor things) nothing crippling to the vehicle, but pricey by the time you fix it all. Hiley Acura service department will not return calls. 

If you are determined to buy from them then be absolutely sure you pull, prod, tug, and even kick the tires. I know it's a used vehicle, but I've never purchased a pre-owned before that had so many pieces falling off. Those things have always been fixed prior to sale.  I won't come back to these guys.

540,10,17-Feb-19,"This dealership has access to more technology to effectively communicate with their clients than what we used to send men to the moon, yet, somehow its management encouraging the use of sales tactics from 1995 when car buying was done through local paper magazine ads. We saw a vehicle posted for sale, called at 9:30 on Saturday morning when dealership opened and were told ""I see it in front of our office and it is current for sale"". Our drive to dealership is just under 1 hour, during which I sent a message to our sales associate 20 minutes before our arrival - to which the associated replied ""Sounds great, let me know when you are here"". Upon our arrival, vehicle was on the lot with Texas Buyers Tag attached to it, dating 2 days prior. Classic bait and switch.

I guess there is a reason for 4 out 5 stars overall rank for a dealership representing a global Acrua brand. I don't fault the sales associate here. So, to sales management in pre-owned department - congratulations. Just remember, in the age of the internet your lot becomes a second choice. ",1,1,0,0
541,11,24-Oct-18,"Recently visited to look at a truck
There asking almost 5 grand above nada clean retail. 
Truck is far from clean
Roof has a lot of hail damaged
Previous own clearly had dogs chewed up back doors 
Seat belts etc 
You could tell it was just dirty inside 
They did what they could to clean but still dirty dark carpet in all cracks. 
Truck needed shocks 
Missing rear tailpipe 
Needs front ball joints. 
Had a check engine light on that they were unsure if it wa a fixed or not
Reset computer by disconnecting batteries. 

A dealership that doesn’t quite care what the true value is of a vehicle 
They just seem to come up with there own price.

As well and the service manager 
She was great

542,12,26-Apr-18,"Where to start. 
I took my car into MCA on Saturday, April 14, 2018, for an oil change.
No one acknowledged that I was even there for a good 10 minutes. One guy was on the phone and proceeded to let me know that! Finally a guy came over to help. Michael L. asked if I had the ""Master Plan"" and I didn't know. He rudely asked me if I had ever paid for an oil change there. He told me that I could wait in the waiting area but I left the car there so obviously I wasn't in a rush as it was only 1:00 PM and I was told on the phone that they closed at 5:00. 
 I told them that I was having problems with a tire losing air pressure. Not a problem, they would look into that too. 
They called within an hour saying my car was ready. On my paperwork it stated that they had changed my oil AND rotated my tires. 
They didn't find anything wrong with my tire but if I continued to have problems I could just call them back. 
Monday, April 16, 2018, I got in my car to go to work and my tire had lost air pressure. BUT the tire in question was still in the location that I was previously having problems so obviously they did NOT rotate my tires as indicated on my paperwork. Now I'm wondering if the even changed the oil? I have called several times with no response. I even called Jennifer H. the customer relations manager, and still have not received a response. I have now contacted Acura Customer Care and filed a complaint with the BBB. 
This is the 3rd car that I have purchased at Mac Churchill and will be the last. The first car that I bought was a used Volvo but found out that it had been wrecked (not disclosed at purchase). Second car was a lease to get out from under the Volvo that I was upside down in. Third car (shame on me!) was a purchase because my lease was up and I really liked the Acura ILX. From the moment I signed the papers, I had trouble with the salesperson contacting me. I had left my CD's in my old car and they were ""looking for them"" and would never get back with me. I finally wrote those off as lost. I have NO trust in them anymore. Enough is enough. They truly do not care about the customer and their investment.

545,15,29-Dec-17,"I found a used car online on their website and took an appointment for the next day. I called before leaving the next day morning to make sure the car was still available as I was driving a long way. I took the day off and went there and was told that the car was no longer available. The manager told me that someone reserved the car, they should have at least the common sense to have told me that was the case so I could have saved a drive and not waste my time taking the day off. At the very least, they could have told me to make a deposit if that is how they operate. They advertise something online and then when you go there tell you that it is no longer available. I was warned by another friend that they do that all the time, but I gave them a benefit of doubt. Overall bad experience.",1,1,0,0
546,16,13-Nov-17,"I went to this dealership to look at a BMW 335i that I found online.  It's time to upgrade from my '07 model even though I still love it.

The sales associate was polite and greeted me as I approached the front door.  We sat down at one of the many tables in the showroom area and he took down my info.  All good so far. 

We took the car on a test drive and I really liked everything about it, except I felt it was a little overpriced based on my research, which I told him.  He asked me what I would like to pay and he told me he would do his best.  I told him I would finance the car through my Credit Union, as they had already preapproved me for 2.49% for up to 5 years.

When we returned to the dealership, he went into the ""manager's pit"" (A room with glass windows but a door so of course you can see them but not hear them)  The managers are behind a tall bartop looking thing - looking down on all of the shoppers.  I'm sure there's some psychological reason why some dealerships do this.  After about 15 minutes, the sales associate comes out with a sheet full of numbers - I examined this closely, and found that not only had they not reduced the price at all, but there was an additional fee of $1800 for ""vehicle restoration"" WHAT???  Every other time I have purchased a car these kinds of fees are included in the price.

The sales associate asked me what my monthly budget is.  I told him I didn't really have one, the most important thing to me was that we get closer to my offer price.  He insisted on getting a number I told him $450 for 60 months, which was $50 less per month than they ""full price"" monthly payment option they had as a suggested payment.  Closer to 20-25 minutes goes by, my sales associate has disappeared, but when I saw him outside the dealership walking around I approached him to ask him what was taking so long.  He apologized and headed back into the managers den and came back out with a new sheet.  He smiled and said ""Great news, we got you down to the payment you requested!""  I took a look at the sheet and realized instantly they had not only not reduced the price or removed the fee - they just extended the payments out to 72 months.  Essentially adding another $2400 to their bottom line from the first time!  What a joke.

I told the sales associate that I wasn't pleased and that I had another appt at another dealership.  I got up to leave and he said ""let me get my manager""  I continued walking out to my car.  As I was getting in I heard my name and sure enough the sales associate and manager were walking briskly towards me.  He introduced himself as the manager who was ""working the numbers""  I told him how I felt that was a cheap move and I liked the car but they would have to get closer to $25k.  He said, what if I can get you $26.5k? Would you do it then?  I thought about it for a minute, and agreed to his offer.  He said, ""Ok, I'll be right back""  I told him he had 10 minutes before I had to leave to see the other car, but if he came back with a sales contract, I would sign it.  

After another 15 minutes, the sales associate came back out with a frustrated look on his face.  He told me the manager sent him out to tell me they wouldn't do any less than $28k on the car plus the restoration fees.  I thanked him, and left to go see the other car where I had a MUCH better experience.

I feel really bad for the sales guy who I'm sure is commissions only.  He really tried hard and was really friendly.  That's the reason for the one star.  Based upon my experience with manager and the ""process"" I will NEVER buy a car from this dealership.",1,1,0,0
547,17,03-Oct-17,"Bought a 2015 TLX new from them. Now with just over 43,000 miles.  Battery died the other morning.  Was able to put a charge on it and take it to Autozone to check it out.  They put their load meter on and said sure enough the battery had a dead cell.  They suggested to take it to the dealer, that it might be under warranty.  ""Big Mistake.""  I set up an appointment for 8:00 in the morning.  They suggested replacing filters, transmission fluid, brake fluid and a tire rotation for nearly $800.  Of course I said xxxx No!  They told me initially that they didn't find anything wrong with the battery.  I called them out on it and they said they could run a load test.  Of course they found that the battery was bad and that it was under warranty and they would replace it.  After 2 1/2 hours (what should have been 30 minutes max.) I left fuming.  Of course the Assistant Service Manager apologized and said it should have only taken 1 1/2 hour max.  I told him I could change one in less than 10 minutes.  He said it was for the paper work.  B.S!  Being a guy that knows better, I got out of there without it costing me money.  I feel for those who do not and get sucked into their indecent practices. ",1,1,0,0

20,19,02-Aug-17,"I called in about a car I saw on their website yesterday. I spoke with a rep who said his name was ""Taco"" Mendez. He seemed nice, as they always do at this stage.

He confirmed that the car was still available and I told him I had challenged credit and thus would not be making the trip to the dealership without a pre-approval. He repeated my request back to me, and I confirmed that I'd already done the financing app on the website. He asked me to send him a picture of my ID, which I did, then he said ""let me go to work for you and I'll be back in touch."" I supplemented my ID with several other identity and address-verifying documents via email. I also included my proof of income, bank statements, etc.

Heard from him after closing. He said ""we have a way to go"" on financing. I set an appointment for the next morning (today), but texted the salesman letting him know I had some questions before coming all the way to dealership. It's 30 miles from my house. I told him I needed a ballpark on financing terms before coming all the way to the dealership given its distance from my house. This information is something other dealerships have gladly provided so as not to waste either party's time. He says his finance manager won't contact any banks without me being there.

Let's just say they're unprofessional. Though I conceded that my credit was bad when I first called in, they thought they could leverage that into getting me into the dealership before discussing any terms. Which is ridiculous considering they've already dinged my credit with a hard inquiry! 

To paint the peacock, when I texted the rep that I was already on my way to a dealership much closer to my house, he (like a high school girl) responded, ""Ok good luck.""

I'm convinced the positive reviews on here are people that were paid or are family members of the sales reps. These guys are trash. Will stick to dealerships rated 4-stars and up on Google.",1,1,1,0

275,21,27-Jun-17,"I've have a relationship with this dealer for almost 20 years.  I no longer trust them.  Everyone in the used car department is in on the scam.  I visited them to buy a truck.  Don pressed me to make an offer on one on the lot so it did.  He did not pass it on the the sales manager (Mr. Brooks) so when I was presented with a purchase agreement, there was no indication that my offer was relayed.  Further, the price of the truck on the sales agreement was now $6,000 higher than advertised .  Outrageous considering Mr. Brooks convinced me to come back after the truck wouldn't start for a test drive saying he would 'make me a deal' in light of the failure.  Bait and switch.  I walked away.  Two weeks later the same truck is still listed everywhere (Cars.com, Autotrader.com, and their own website) but now FOR THE PRICE I OFFERED.  I went to them to initiate the sale the day after the price was changed but was told it was sold two days prior.  In essence the price was changed but the truck was not on the lot any more and they had no intention of selling it at the advertised price.  That is Fraud!

My sales guy tells me they sold me on the wrong car and they made a mistake. The car I wanted was listed cheaper and my sales guy tells me he needed more money. 300 more to be exact. That was a joke. After i left. He called me back in to talk to anther director and gave me some bogus story about why he ran my credit without my authorization. I now put 500 more down to take the car. Before I take it, i listed everything that was wrong. I was assured it would be fixed. After talking and dealing with different sales reps, because my original sale rep kept ignoring my calls and texts, I drop my car off for service. Which i was told it would be ready the same day. 3 days later when I pick it up. Nothing I listed to fix was not fixed. Not to mention the greese stain that was left behind on the floor matt.

551,24,13-Jun-17,"I drove over 350 miles to MacChurchill to buy a used vehicle. I talked with Bryant over the phone several times about the vehicle, confirmed its availability and that it would not be sold before I arrived. I was repeatedly assured that the vehicle was waiting on me and I didn't need to do anything further. When we arrived for our appointment (after getting up at 3am and driving), we were informed that Bryant had called in and the vehicle had been sold the night before. No one had called to inform us of the vehicle's sale. I was highly disappointed in the lack of professionalism displayed overall at the dealership. I was repeatedly told that ""these things happen"", which I can understand to a degree. In my opinion, basic courtesy would be to extend a phone call to inform someone that the car has sold (especially if they were driving 350 miles to buy the car). It was also slightly shady that Bryant was ""running late"" and then ""called in sick"" to our scheduled appointment...especially considering the circumstances. I really do understand that people have life occurrences, but overall it left a bad taste in my mouth for the dealership and the sales staff.  

Joseph Trinh was the salesman who was initially taking care of us when we arrived , and he was very nice and apologetic. He tried very hard to find us a vehicle that was comparable, but ultimately they were not able to do so. I negotiated with 4 different managers, but in the end they were unable to match prices of other dealerships. 

I went in to buy a mid-level vehicle from MacChurchill. I ended up buying a top level vehicle from another dealership, with similar miles to the MacChurchill vehicle, and I payed $2k less for the top line vehicle. ",1,1,0,0

Believing that I was being told the truth I agreed to have my car worked on. This was on a Wednesday afternoon and I was told that the part would have to be shipped overnight to arrive on Thursday. Once the part arrived it would be a quick fix and I would have the car sometime late Friday morning. On Thursday afternoon about 3:30pm I stopped by the service center to grab some items I had left in my car. At this time I was once again told that the part would be in any minute and the car would be repaired the next morning.

Friday morning I called my service advisor three times on his direct line and he did not return my calls. Finally around 3pm I called the service center's main line to have me transferred. The advisor picked up immediately in which he decided to inform me that the part was on back-order and would not arrive for approximately one month.  

I was not given a straight answer as to why it took multiple phone calls and several hours after my completion time to be told the part was on back-order. The advisor should have known it was on back order the second the part was ordered. 

Due to this deception I took my car to another Acura Service Center in DFW. After they looked at my vehicle they confirmed the part on back order but happened to bring up that the issue with the vehicle was 100% covered under warranty. 

Some might say that such a deception borders on flat out thievery.

I bought a car from them, the car had some damage in the hood and bumper. It was showing nothing in the CarFax report which was really strange.

Business usually run on trust, my biggest mistake was trusting them.

They made me test drive a different car claiming that my car would have the exact same feature, which it did not.
They made me wait for a month to get the car(told me it would take a week to fix it), made me sign the contract for the car before the car was fixed and also said that my 5 car trial period would start after my car was fixed and I get my car.
Since my car didn't have the feature it was promised, I went back to return the car and they said that my 5 day trial period started the day I signed the contract.

They are not giving me my down payment money and keep stalling me.
Even Up to today, it's been more than 3 weeks that I have asked for a refund, they keep stalling me saying they can do nothing.

Audi Plano has to be by far the most condescending and rude Finance Team there is. To be treated like I was not good enough or could not afford the vehicle was just outrageous. 

I went in today for my 2nd appointment to pick out the color and options to see what kind of negotiation we could do and instead we got disrespected and laughed at by Trey, the Director of Finance and Peter in Finance. 

Thank you to Neil, Marcio, and Danny for coming back and trying to recover from the damage the others did. Thank you for being respectful and apologizing for their horrible behavior, even when you did not do the insulting. 

It’s sad, you could’ve had my business had we not experienced that discrimination. We didn’t ask you to do us any favors, we just ask for you to be transparent with the numbers. You instead chose to be disrespectful and treat me like I could not afford it (I hv excellent credit and make great $) and you had already made your decision on if you were even going to try and sale this vehicle to me as soon as u walked up. Shame on you for your derogatory behavior, remarks, and your terrible manners.

BMW Arlington
I took my 2006 BMW 650I convertible to BMW Arlington for an oil change and to diagnose a problem with the GPS and a seat belt sensor. I spoke to Joshua Boller Service Consultant, this man was super nice and very helpful, an unbelievable employee. 
BMW Arlington had my car for 2 days, the service was done to my car and I was given several quotes for repair work for different things. One, I was informed that I had an oil leak from the front upper oil pan and given a $1750.00 quote to repair this leak.  Another, I was given a $1400.00 quote to repair some wiring that had been “cut” I was told. I declined those repairs as it is an older car with more than 100,000 miles on it so I didn’t want to put that kind of money into it. I drove the car very little over the next few months, watching the oil level when I did use it. 
On 2/16/2017, a friend that owns an auto repair shop and I were talking and he said let’s put your BMW on the lift and see that oil leak. I took it to his shop and watched him lift the car. Under the car you could see oil spray down the center of the car and oil dripping from the front of the engine. He shined a flashlight up and you could clearly see the oil coming from the front of the valve covers, dripping down the engine. He said “That’s not an upper oil pan leak”. He took the car off of the lift and removed the air breather cover and clearly visible was oil coming from the front of the valve covers. He showed me where 3 bolts on each valve cover were loose and where a socket had knocked the dust from the bolts and all 6 bolts were loosened to allow oil to leak from the covers. He tightened these bolts and cleaned the oil from the engine and “Presto” NO MORE OIL LEAK.
He also looked in the trunk, (Something I hadn’t done) and showed me where the wiring harness to the trunk lid had several wires cut. These were exposed and the rubber protection covers had been cut away and were lying in the trunk. All of the plastic rivets were removed and missing.   All of the trunk interior covers were removed and hanging loose. NONE of this was that way when I took my car to BMW. 
I was so disturbed by what I had seen. My friend said it looked to him like the wiring and oil leak were done on purpose to cause the oil leak and run up the price at BMW. He suggested that I go to BMW and talk to the service manager because if someone that worked for him had done that he would want to know and he would fire them.
On 02/17/2017, I went to BMW Arlington and walked in and talked to Joshua Boller. I had him look up the quotes and informed him of what had occurred and he assured me that he did not believe that anyone at BMW would have done that. I said that as a courtesy to the dealership I wanted to bring it to their attention. I DIDN’T WANT ANYTHING, I was disturbed by what I had seen for myself and felt that going there and informing them was a courtesy to them because they may have a problem and don’t know it. I didn’t want someone else to be a victim. Had I blindly authorized the work, it would have cost more than $4000.00. I asked him to get the service manager so I could talk to him and he did.
I do not remember the man’s name when he introduced himself to me as the Service Manager, because he immediately gave me attitude. I relayed the story to him and he all but called me a liar, he even insisted “I’m not calling you a liar, but that didn’t happen here.” I told him NO ONE ELSE HAS BEEN IN THAT CAR EXCEPT BMW. He said even the suggestion of what I was saying was “repulsive”. I told him that I was just informing them to be alert because they may have a problem that they were not aware of. He was extremely curt and rude. Nothing like how I had been treated by ALL of the other employees at BMW that I had spoken to. He told me that he had looked up who had worked on my car and said HE is “One of my team leaders”, I do spot checks on all of my people and they do excellent work and no one would risk their “$100,000.00 job to do that, they all do excellent work”.
I asked him to come to my car parked outside and I showed him inside the trunk where everything is disconnected and removed lying in the trunk and asked I asked him “Is this the kind of excellent work your team leader does?” He simply turned and walked away. I then left the dealership.
I have never been treated like this before and was embarrassed that I had even involved Joshua Boller, he is an excellent employee. I believe he was embarrassed as well and I apologize to him here for even involving him. 
The service manager was arrogant, rude, condescending, and should be reprimanded. Had this man simply said thank you for the information and stated he would look into it they would still have a customer, but he didn’t.
I have seen people with hundreds, even thousands of dollars in their pocket caught shoplifting, most of the time for minor items! Why would they do that? Who knows? If this service manager is so naïve to think that there is not a possibility that someone working there could have done this, then HE should be replaced.
I am convinced after personally looking at the evidence and seeing what they tried to sell me in repairs that someone at BMW is doing something they shouldn’t be doing in service and repairs. Was the oil leak “created”? Were the wires cut there? Is this a “One person issue” or does it go deeper? 
I paid more than $500.00 for the diagnosis and feel like I was taken advantage of. I will never use BMW Arlington again and will provide my story and opinion to all that will listen.
Don’t blindly accept huge repair bills, get a second opinion, it saved me thousands of dollars.
I have posted this because I feel that everyone should be aware of ALL OF THE INFORMATION.

777,282,08-Feb-18,"A few years ago, we changed from general automotive repair facilities in Weatherford to Jerry's.  At first, we found the experience a welcomed change.  We appreciated our initial service writer, Brad Minot, with whom we developed a long-standing relationship, the overall customer service, loaner vehicles, etc.  However, this is now the second time recently I've had maintenance done at Jerry's only to bring the car home to immediately encounter car trouble.  A few months ago, we brought our suburban in for some work and an oil change.  During the oil change, allegedly all fluids were checked and topped-off.  However, shortly thereafter, the transmission would not shift appropriately.  I pulled the transmission fluid dipstick only to find there was no fluid on the dipstick.  I'm not exactly sure how ""all fluids were checked and filled"" yet there was no fluid on the dipstick.  Now, we just picked up our suburban again yesterday after having some more repair work done, which included having Jerry's perform a state inspection.

778,283,03-Mar-17,"I contacted this dealership through their website back around early-mid February. I found a truck that would eat a lot of the negative I had going in, and granted I knew it wasn't ""free"" money, but I wanted out of my deal and this was a way to accomplish that. Michael contacted me through email fairly quickly (pretty sure it was an automated email), but I was contacted. I told him what I had going on, and I know my particular situation is a car salesman's nightmare, but he said he would take a look at it. I then didn't hear from him for a little over a week, and he said apologized for the miscommunication and that he had to find the right truck. Which, confused me because I thought we already had, either way, no big deal, moving along. So, he sends me a link to one via email that I would go check out the next day. That particular truck sold the night we spoke, so the next day when I got out there, he only had two with a particular bonus tag attached. Michael was nice, straight forward about it, and that we'd need to find a different truck. He located one, which I had pulled up on my phone, but couldn't seem to find it in his system. After some digging, he located the keys, but then it was on to actually find it. We drove around for probably about 20 or so minutes before he actually found it. I'll be honest, I'm not sure how many salesmen that see my kind of deal, would drive around for 20 minutes to find a vehicle, so this was nice. Anyways, found the truck, I wasn't crazy about the color, so we spoke for a bit and I told him I'd think about it. That night, I wrote him an email telling him I had thought about it and would like to go ahead. He contacted me around 10am the next day and we spoke for a little, and had asked me to do a credit app, I agreed that was a way to move forward. After finishing the credit app, he called to tell me the payment and that he had an approval. I was first a little confused, because it was $40 more a month then what we had spoken about the night before, and not only $40 more a month, it also went from a 75 to an 84 month term. I asked him the details around it, why did it change, what was the interest rate they were basing those numbers on, etc. He stated that the dealership doesn't give him that information (if this is true, what the xxxx guys? How can a customer make an informative decision with his salesman if you can't even provide him the pertinent details). So, I said that doesn't make any sense, but sure, if you could have them call me, that would be great. Four or so hours passed, no call, so I called him. He stated he had gotten busy, and that I would hear from him that night, or early the next day. I didn't hear from him that night, and the next morning by 11am (could have been 10:30ish, not sure) still no word. So I texted him, it took a while, but then I got a text back; ""Well, the truck sold this morning."" Now, I'm a little annoyed at this point. It was a simple request, I didn't ask for anything remotely complex. I use Credit Karma to review my information each week/month and wouldn't ya know it, they reflect that the dealership hit my credit with 8 different banks. Yes, that's the number that comes after 7. I call him to figure it out, he's busy. So, I called the dealership and asked for the manager. Spoke with the manager (I think it was Jeff, I can't remember, he also said he would call me back, never did), and Michael had stated to him that he didn't have a ""commitment"" from me. Commitment, by definition, is being ""dedicated to a activity"". I don't know guys, I think a lot of people would agree that having you run my information for a particular truck to be a ""dedication"" to an activity. Here's what I think.

I spoke to him later that day, and he admitted he was at fault, but stated that he couldn't do much because that was a truck with the most rebates. He did say, which made me chuckle, that he can't do much when there are ""64 employee's at the dealership"". Yeah, but you can, you could have ensured that finance called me sooner, rather than never. You could have placed the vehicle in an area and tagged it ""pending"". You could have done, what other dealerships do all of the time. It's just not a good look to run the credit (8 times, remember, that's the one that comes after 7) of a customer on a particular vehicle, and then sell said vehicle without ever informing the customer how they could ensure that wouldn't happen (e.g., deposit).

798,307,10-Apr-18,"I made two trips to this dealership to buy a Yukon XL.  First trip (on a Friday), salesman A (Mo) took all my information down and valued my trade in and said he was gonna call and email me information on Monday which I thought was weird because he didn't even seem like he wanted to make a sale that day.  
A week goes by and I never hear from him so I sent another internet request for information.  After getting a call from salesman B (James), we arranged an appointment to check out two trucks that had the exterior/interior color combination I wanted.  I came back into Westpoint GMC on a Saturday.  Car #1 was a demo car being driven by one of the managers as a daily driver that had almost 4,000 miles but the salesman kept insisting was new because it was never titled.  Car #2 was brand new with no miles.  Keep in mind these are the exact same trucks with the only thing differing between the two was bench seat vs. bucket seat second row.  
So we walk inside to work out some numbers on both trucks and the salesman came back and said the demo truck was gonna be my best deal.  He never even gave me any option to talk about the truck with 0 miles.  James, the salesman, low-balled the heck out of me on my trade-in and quoted me an outrageous price on the demo truck with almost 4,000 miles.  I was immediately turned off and showed him paperwork from other offers I got.  He went to the back and immediately came back and said they could give me $8000 more for my trade-in and drop the price a couple thousand--a difference of almost $10,000 just like that.  I wanted a breakdown of the numbers and even at the offer they just gave me, something didn't seem right about it.  I did the math (very generously in their favor might I add) on my own and even showed James the salesman the ""out the door"" price it should have been given the information he just presented me because I wanted to know where the extra $5,000ish was coming from.  He stumbled a bit because he couldn't give me a straight answer.  
At that point, I asked for my keys back and left Westpoint, purchased my vehicle same day at another dealership, and never looked back.
I don't claim to be an expert on selling cars, but Westpoint GMC committed every salesman error in the book including, but not limited to:  they didn't read the needs of the customer and just assumed I was an idiot when I walked in, they were not very knowledgeable about the product they were selling, and most importantly, they did not attempt at any time to seem like they were being truthful and forthcoming while doing business.
These two visits to Westpoint GMC is the reason most people dread the car-buying experience.  I usually don't write reviews and rather let people make their own opinions on a business, but I'm actually making it a point steer people away from Westpoint GMC so they don't have experience I had.",1,6,0,0
297,308,01-Aug-17,"BUYER BEWARE!  We were promised a deal on Saturday which would be good through Monday. When we came in to sign the paperwork on Monday we were presented with a price $5,000 higher than originally promised! This is not a joke or a misrepresentation. This extreme withdrawal tactic is criminal and demonstrated the lack of integrity and fair dealing of this dealer's management. We were offended and appalled by their manipulative tactics. 

We were upfront with our situation and needs, and this dealership completely misrepresented their pricing and would not honor their promised deal. We went to Sterling McCall GMC on the southwest freeway the same Monday and bought a similarly featured Yukon XL with no hassle. The stark difference between the straight forward dealing at Sterling McCall GMC and the underhanded ways of Westpoint GMC (especially Nate the manager) could not be more evident.

As soon as we were seated he mentioned that he would need to go talk to the sales office and within five minutes, he returned mentioning that the dealership no longer had the coupons he was using in the deal and his Sales Manager would no longer be able to honor the deal that we had agreed to.

809,322,29-Mar-18,"I have a 2013 Chevrolet Suburban that has a second water leak on a body seam leaking into the passengers floorboard. To back up a little bit this car replaced a 2010 Tahoe that had a roof that was leaking and they were going to have to replace the roof on the car. So we got the suburban thinking that the Tahoe was just a lemon and this one would be better. Well back to the leaking car. I took the car to the dealership and was told that it was probably leaking around the windshield that had been replaced. So I made an appointment with the body shop and they tested the windshield and found no leaks. A couple of weeks later I am back at the dealership and was told that it was going to cost around $300.00 to diagnose the problem. I was called later and told it was a body seam leaking and that it was not covered. I asked if I could come take pictures ( they would not let me take pictures of the first leak ). I asked if I could come take pictures and I was told that they hadn't taken the car apart yet but when they did I could take pictures. When I got there to take pictures I was told it was leaking behind a blob of caulking that GM smears on the seams. I made the comment that any normal person could see that if the blob of caulking would have been smeared in the area of the leak it would not have leaked. I asked them how they would repair the leak and the answer was to put some more caulking in the area behind the original blob of caulking. So in other words where the other caulking should have been. Their answer was always the same, I don't know.  I have a case on this problem with GM and the service department  will not mention to them that if the caulking would have smeared in the area that was leaking  it may have never leaked. All they would mention to them was the car had been in an accident in which the body shop told me there was no damage in that area.  They also told GM that it may have been cause by the way I drive, weather conditions, or the flexing of the vehicle that cracks the body sealant causing it to separate  ( I did not see any cracks or separation ). I went back to the dealership and told them I needed documentation as to what caused it to leak and also that something stating that the door gasket and wires running along the threshold of the door had been under water because of the water leak and I was told I had all of the documentation on my invoice I was going to get. All it said was where body seam was leaking  and that it was fixed.  I was told that the corporate person was just giving me the run around.

We appreciated our initial service writer, Brad Minot, with whom we developed a long-standing relationship, the overall customer service, loaner vehicles, etc.  However, this is now the second time recently I've had maintenance done at Jerry's only to bring the car home to immediately encounter car trouble.  A few months ago, we brought our suburban in for some work and an oil change.  During the oil change, allegedly all fluids were checked and topped-off.  However, shortly thereafter, the transmission would not shift appropriately.  I pulled the transmission fluid dipstick only to find there was no fluid on the dipstick.  I'm not exactly sure how ""all fluids were checked and filled"" yet there was no fluid on the dipstick.  Now, we just picked up our suburban again yesterday after having some more repair work done, which included having Jerry's perform a state inspection.  Somehow, it passed inspection but suddenly has a ""check engine"" light being displayed, and the engine is running roughly and missing.  This wasn't happening prior to bringing it to Jerry's.

It’s a easy deal that I have a trade with all the info you needed to get it appraised and I knew exactly what truck i wanted. Just wanted to get the ball rolling and they were not interested in doing business. They wanted me to come in and and that’s not working with what’s going on unless we are good to go.

850,369,08-Feb-18,"A few years ago, we changed from general automotive repair facilities in Weatherford to Jerry's.  At first, we found the experience a welcomed change.  We appreciated our initial service writer, Brad Minot, with whom we developed a long-standing relationship, the overall customer service, loaner vehicles, etc.  However, this is now the second time recently I've had maintenance done at Jerry's only to bring the car home to immediately encounter car trouble.  A few months ago, we brought our suburban in for some work and an oil change.  During the oil change, allegedly all fluids were checked and topped-off.  However, shortly thereafter, the transmission would not shift appropriately.  I pulled the transmission fluid dipstick only to find there was no fluid on the dipstick.  I'm not exactly sure how ""all fluids were checked and filled"" yet there was no fluid on the dipstick.  Now, we just picked up our suburban again yesterday after having some more repair work done, which included having Jerry's perform a state inspection.  Somehow, it passed inspection but suddenly has a ""check engine"" light being displayed, and the engine is running roughly and missing.  This wasn't happening prior to bringing it to Jerry's.  The appearance is, at best, that poor service and lack of QA is becoming rampant at Jerry's; worse, is that malicious acts are being done to incur more maintenance in order to generate additional revenue.  I hope these are isolated and unfortunate coincidences, but the experience has been extremely frustrating.  My family has purchased vehicles from Jerry's dating back to my grandparents.  Regrettably, I think we're being forced to begin doing business elsewhere.

851,370,03-Mar-17,"I contacted this dealership through their website back around early-mid February. I found a truck that would eat a lot of the negative I had going in, and granted I knew it wasn't ""free"" money, but I wanted out of my deal and this was a way to accomplish that. Michael contacted me through email fairly quickly (pretty sure it was an automated email), but I was contacted. I told him what I had going on, and I know my particular situation is a car salesman's nightmare, but he said he would take a look at it. I then didn't hear from him for a little over a week, and he said apologized for the miscommunication and that he had to find the right truck. Which, confused me because I thought we already had, either way, no big deal, moving along. So, he sends me a link to one via email that I would go check out the next day. That particular truck sold the night we spoke, so the next day when I got out there, he only had two with a particular bonus tag attached. Michael was nice, straight forward about it, and that we'd need to find a different truck. He located one, which I had pulled up on my phone, but couldn't seem to find it in his system. After some digging, he located the keys, but then it was on to actually find it. We drove around for probably about 20 or so minutes before he actually found it. I'll be honest, I'm not sure how many salesmen that see my kind of deal, would drive around for 20 minutes to find a vehicle, so this was nice. Anyways, found the truck, I wasn't crazy about the color, so we spoke for a bit and I told him I'd think about it. That night, I wrote him an email telling him I had thought about it and would like to go ahead. He contacted me around 10am the next day and we spoke for a little, and had asked me to do a credit app, I agreed that was a way to move forward. After finishing the credit app, he called to tell me the payment and that he had an approval. I was first a little confused, because it was $40 more a month then what we had spoken about the night before, and not only $40 more a month, it also went from a 75 to an 84 month term. I asked him the details around it, why did it change, what was the interest rate they were basing those numbers on, etc. He stated that the dealership doesn't give him that information (if this is true, what the xxxx guys? How can a customer make an informative decision with his salesman if you can't even provide him the pertinent details). So, I said that doesn't make any sense, but sure, if you could have them call me, that would be great. Four or so hours passed, no call, so I called him. He stated he had gotten busy, and that I would hear from him that night, or early the next day. I didn't hear from him that night, and the next morning by 11am (could have been 10:30ish, not sure) still no word. So I texted him, it took a while, but then I got a text back; ""Well, the truck sold this morning."" Now, I'm a little annoyed at this point. It was a simple request, I didn't ask for anything remotely complex. I use Credit Karma to review my information each week/month and wouldn't ya know it, they reflect that the dealership hit my credit with 8 different banks. Yes, that's the number that comes after 7. I call him to figure it out, he's busy. So, I called the dealership and asked for the manager. Spoke with the manager (I think it was Jeff, I can't remember, he also said he would call me back, never did), and Michael had stated to him that he didn't have a ""commitment"" from me. Commitment, by definition, is being ""dedicated to a activity"". I don't know guys, I think a lot of people would agree that having you run my information for a particular truck to be a ""dedication"" to an activity. Here's what I think. I think Michael screwed up. I think he either sold it to a customer who he had face to face, because that was easier to do, or he took his eye off the ball and screwed up. I spoke to him later that day, and he admitted he was at fault, but stated that he couldn't do much because that was a truck with the most rebates. He did say, which made me chuckle, that he can't do much when there are ""64 employee's at the dealership"". Yeah, but you can, you could have ensured that finance called me sooner, rather than never. You could have placed the vehicle in an area and tagged it ""pending"". You could have done, what other dealerships do all of the time. It's just not a good look to run the credit (8 times, remember, that's the one that comes after 7) of a customer on a particular vehicle, and then sell said vehicle without ever informing the customer how they could ensure that wouldn't happen (e.g., deposit). 

Was Michael nice? Sure. But nice won't make the inquiries on my credit fall off. Michael did call and leave a VM two days ago, after March rebates had hit, and gave me details on a truck he found stating ""the payment is higher, but if you can swing it, it's a nice truck"".  I have filed a complaint with the BBB, for the simple fact that you cannot, nor should you, run someones credit in such a irresponsible manner. I have not (as of yet) filed a complaint with the Texas AG's office (still contemplating that). Maybe the employees need better training, maybe a different career path. Either way, this was a different experience than what I'm used to and for someone with over 14 years experience in the industry AND a dealership with such a high rating, unacceptable. ",1,9,0,0

They didn't put the jack and tire tools in their proper place - just left them under the back seat. Took them a while to find someone that knew how to put the tools back properly.

895,420,20-Feb-19,"Purchased a brand new (with 30 miles) 2015 Tahoe on December 31, 2014. Purchased the extended warranty -- 5 year / 100,000 miles. Over the next three years, took the Tahoe into the service dept about 4 times due to problems with the transmission / fuel lines.  Our vehicle would act like there was an air bubble in the gas line, it would act like a brief stall at times.  It was not consistent.  They claimed to have ""checked it out and found nothing"" each and every time.  In January of 2019 (and 117k miles), we discovered the problem, as our transmission went out on us, leaving us stranded in Dallas.  After discussing the issue with three different transmission shops, this is VERY common in the 8 speed automatic transmissions.  We have had the transmission replaced, and it is still acting the same as before.  :-(  

Prior to the transmission going out, we also had to have our air conditioner replaced, as it went out at 105k miles.  We also had to have the shocks replaced at about 80k miles (not under warranty, as shocks are excluded -- for a reason).  Come to find out, the shocks have metal pieces in them and thus cut the lining, which causes them to leak......also VERY common in Chevrolet vehicles such as the Tahoe.  

Of course, NONE of these problems are included in recalls, despite the known issues time and time again.  So I called the dealership, as I feel in our new cars today, 100k miles is ""just getting broke in"" -- and that was what the salesman told me also.  However, when Mike Hewlett called me (over 2 weeks after I left the message) to talk to me about it, his attitude was one of ""that's A LOT of miles"" and ""you got a LOT out of good use out that vehicle"".  I reminded him that I am still making payments on it, and did not feel that 100k miles was a lot.  He had a very arrogant and flippant attitude and had zero desire to make anything right in the matter.  

I will NEVER purchase another vehicle from this dealership, as I feel their service department just kept pushing me off until the warranty ran out.  As I read some other comments, it seems this is also a common practice at this dealership.

901,426,22-Jun-18,"Went to the dealership to look at and test drive and buy it the price was right. After the test drive we decided to see if they would agree to my deal and a deal was made. Then all the problems started, got to finance  and the numbers didn't match the deal, finally got that taken care of and papers sign. Then It was time to get with the salesperson and get the keys and remote fobs and was told they could not find the second key, fobs or the owners manual and would have them for me the next day and I would get a phone call when they were ready to be picked up. So when I did hear from the salesperson I decided to send him, the general sales manager a email to try to get someone to get back in touch about my not have keys to my new truck. I finally called to talk to the salesperson or one of the sales managers but no luck they were all busy, finally the salesperson call and was told he still didn't  have my key and would have them the next day at noon. So I went in  and the salesperson was not there and was told the make ready manager had key and would take care of it. So I hand it to the make ready manger for jumping through hoops to make sure our visit as painless as possible, very nice guy to deal with unlike any of the sales team which I hope to never have to deal with again. A truck or car should never be sold if the key can not be located. If I would have know this truck had no keys and fobs i would not have signed the papers. I think the sales team only interest is making sales no matter what. I will never buy from this dealership!!!!!! And any body reading this beware ask to see all the keys before signing papers.

906,433,16-Aug-17,"We purchased a used vehicle at the end of July. As part of the purchase there were 3 things that the dealership said they would fix. One being a back passenger door that didn't open from the outside. After they ""fixed"" the door and we drove off my daughter noticed that the same door now wouldn't open from the inside. We contacted the salesman and we agreed that they would fix it at the time they fixed the other two items. So about a week later we were called to come in to have the vehicle fixed. My husband took a day off work to get it taken care of. The vehicle stayed at the dealership all day getting fixed. When we picked it up we checked the door and it was still not fixed. We were told we would have to bring the car back in order to have it fixed. Our salesman apologized and said that when we brought it in he would put gas in the car and have it cleaned up. Great we thought that was fair. So fast forward to today when the car was taken in to get fixed. I got there and the service representative said he was going to try to have it done today and they could provide me with a ride home. I was fine with that when I was called to the shuttle along with two males. I was told they would be taking me home first but because of one of the other parties having to go to work I was bumped to the second stop. The paper with my address and all the other addresses of those who had been in that shuttle that day was sitting in the open for anyone to see. As we got to traveling it dawned on me that I was going to be dropped off at my house in front of two complete strangers. Your policies need to be updated to protect your customers or you need to make it clear that you don't do anything to protect address information and location of your customers who use the shuttle. As we were traveling down my street I was notified that the vehicle was ready. So the shuttle did a u turn and brought me back to the dealership. The service representative told me he was trying to get authorization for the gas and clean up that was promised to us. I sat there in the waiting room for an additional HOUR after the car was ""ready"". The service representative was not able to get the salesman to return his calls and the sales manager wouldn't authorize the gas or clean up until the salesman called back. At that point I just wanted to leave. So they brought my vehicle to me. I didn't get the gas or clean up promised to me due to the inconvenience of having to bring it back multiple times and when I got in the car I noticed red paint transfer of the driver side door like a car door was open into it. I honestly feel like since we purchased a used car we were not a priority... I feel like after we signed the sales agreement we were no longer a priority...

951,482,07-Jan-17,"To Whom It May Concern,

Greetings,

Let’s see, I almost don’t know where to begin this unsatisfactory review, but here we go.  I was involved in an accident in the early part of August with another vehicle in my 2014 Chevy High Country.  The vehicle sustained front end and body damage along the passenger side.  I took my truck for repairs to Strickland Chevrolet in Pearland, Texas where the truck was bought.  

The truck remained at the dealership for about 1 month until repairs were completed.  I was amazed at the length of time to repair the vehicle.  I was even informed by one of the service technicians that the vehicle sat in the service department for 4-5 days without being touched.  Upon arrival to receive my repaired vehicle, I noticed there was white paint and scratches along the passenger rear quarter panel.  I as the body shop technician to explain why the body damage was not also repaired.  The technician informed me that they did not conduct a damage assessment on the vehicle and only repaired the mechanical damage and body damage at the front end of the vehicle because that is what I reported to my insurance company.  He told me they though that was preexisting damage.  I said, “Are you kidding me, because the paint on the rear quarter was white and it was very obvious I hit a white car.

I called the body shop manager our, he was defensive from the start.  I immediately realized I was getting no where with him and ask for the dealership GM.  The GM immediately wanted to pass the handling of the situation back to the body shop manager.  The dealership GM was completely useless and offered nothing but excuses of why he was not qualified to help me.  One thing I learned as a 29 year Army officer is that the officer in charge or GM in this situation is ultimately responsible for everything that happens at the dealership.  When I received the customer satisfaction survey from Chevrolet, of course the dealership was given a negative review with comments of what had transpired.  

I took the truck anyway as it is my work truck and I needed it back immediately.  Upon leaving the dealership I drove to a local Sonic for a burger, upon backing at the Sonic, I realized my brakes were failing.  I immediately returned to Strickland Chevrolet and expressed my displeasure with the repairs and safety concerns to the dealership.  The brake fault told me that the vehicle was not tested before it was returned to me.  

The vehicle was placed back into service immediately.  After several weeks, the vehicle was returned to me as being fully repaired.  I drove the vehicle for about a week and the brake problem returned in addition to a noise developing under the truck near the transmission.  I returned to truck to be serviced once again.  When I received the customer satisfaction survey from Chevrolet, of course the dealership was given a negative review with comments of what had transpired.  


After several more weeks, I was informed that the brakes were finally repaired and that that the dealership could not isolate the noise under the truck, but they thought it was the $400.00 custom after market muffler I had installed on the truck.  The service representative informed me they were going to replace the muffler with an OEM stock muffler.  I informed them I did not think the issue was the muffler, but to proceed as needed to resolve the issue.  After several more weeks, I contacted them and they informed me the issue was not the muffler, but recommended that I keep the OEM stock muffler anyway.  I was informed that the insurance company would be charged for the muffler anyway and that I should just keep it.  I told them I wanted the custom muffler placed back on the truck as it was found.  I contacted my insurance company and informed them no to pay the dealership for any repairs associated with the vehicle’s muffler.  Finally after some time, the noise was isolated and repairs were performed.   When I received the customer satisfaction survey from Chevrolet, of course the dealership was once again given a negative review with comments of what had transpired.  
 

I received my truck back from the dealership once again.  After a couple weeks of driving the vehicle I noticed a popping noise at the front end of the vehicle when the steering wheel was turned or if the truck was driven over a bump.  I also noticed a loud metal on metal rattle in the cab under the dash board near the steering column.  Shortly thereafter, the AC stopped cooling as well.  I cannot verify if the AC problem is associated with the initial accident or some unrelated condition.  I immediately contacted the service department once again to arrange the return of the vehicle for additional servicing.  The service representative told me to bring the truck in as soon as possible for service.  As stated above, this is my work vehicle as well and needed to wait a week or so to return the vehicle for servicing once again.

When I was ready to return the truck for servicing, I called the service representative to schedule the repairs.  I got his voicemail several times, each time leaving him a message.  After several days with no reply, I called the service manager, again getting his voicemail.  I left several voicemails for the service manager with no reply.  After a day I called and left a message for the dealership GM.

After no reply from the GM I placed a formal complaint with GM Customer Service.  The customer service representative contacted the dealership for explanation as to why I had not received a reply from any level of leadership at the dealership.  I was then informed that the dealership is denying providing me with any further service or warranty work on my Chevy truck.  I ask what this decision was based on and the GM customer service representative informed me that the dealership informed then that it was a decision made by the GM district manager.  

My complaint was then escalated to a GM senior account manager.  I explained the situation and my concerns in detail to the senior GM representative.  I expressed my concern that some if not all of the unresolved issues were covered and paid for under my auto insurance policy.  I explained my situation that the dealership is not denying me any future service under my auto policy of which they have already been paid.  I was told by the senior account manager that the complaint was forwarded to the dealership and that the dealership had 48-72 hours to reply.  The senior GM advisor informed me that once a reply was obtained from the dealership, a plan of how my vehicle repairs could be performed and what actions would be taken to resolve the issue, but regardless of the dealership reply, my concerns and needed vehicle repairs would be resolved to my satisfaction.

That was at least two weeks ago and after several calls to the GM customer service department; I have yet to hear back from the senior GM advisor as to the dealership’s reply and what actions GM would take to resolve my concerns and to get my vehicle properly repaired.  I was informed during my last call to the GM customer service department was that they were still waiting for a reply from the dealership before action could be taken.  I was informed that the senior GM representative would be contacting me the next day with the next course of action.  The day passed with no call back from the senior GM representative.

I am still concerned about the safe driving of this vehicle, how my vehicle repair issues will be resolved and the explanation of what the dealership used as a bases to deny me future vehicle service and that I was no longer welcome at their dealership.  My frustration has now spread from no only Strickland Chevrolet, but now with GM and Chevrolet themselves.  I would expect that a corporation the size and status of GM would provide their loyal customers with a more rapid response to explain the situation and to quickly resolve the issue when customer safety and satisfaction is at stake.

The only issue I know the dealership could have with me that I know of is the 3-4 negative reviews I gave on the GM customer service surveys.  I never imagined that the dealership would take retribution against a customer if they completed a negative review against the dealership’s professionalism and services provided.  I feel the dealership was given more than ample opportunities to correctly repair my vehicle properly.

I have always been a fan and loyal customer of Chevrolet regardless of local dealership issues.  As a matter of fact, I just purchased a new 2017 Chevy High Country from AutoNation Chevrolet, Gulf Freeway in Houston, Texas as a statement of my loyalty to Chevy and the products they offer.  I like the Chevy High Country so much that I now own two, the 2014 and now a new 2017 one.  The 2014 High Country is still in need of repairs and will be scheduled shortly with the new dealership of which I am very pleased in ever possible aspect possible.

990,524,04-Apr-19,"As a new car owner, I wanted to bring my car in for my first free engine oil change. I called ahead to ask if I needed to book an appointment and was told I could drive in, that service would be first come first serve, and that services closed at 7pm. I arrived at 5:50pm and before I could even say why I was there, I was told that I needed to leave because the service men went home. I explained how I had just called and what I had just been told. I was then told I was misinformed and that they closed at 6pm. Another worker came over to help address the situation, and said if I came back tomorrow, at any time, they’d help facilitate my oil change quickly by pushing me closer to the front of line. Together they added I could have a coupon for a free wash. I said ok and came back the next morning. When I pulled up, again before I could even say a word, a woman told me it would take 2.5-3 hours if I wanted to be seen. It bothered me I didn’t even get to tell her why I was there. There was a lot of “you should just go somewhere else” in her demeanor. It seemed like if I wanted an oil change, it wasn’t convenient at all to go to Gunn. That’s my impression still. The employees made it seem like a complicated ordeal, but when we purchased my car from the salesman only a few months ago, he made it seem like Gunn would take great care of things like this and wanted to. I could’ve gone to a Valvoline and had this taken care of so simply. It just doesn’t make sense why this happened. After I got to explain my situation, the worker told me I should’ve come earlier, then walked away to see if she could confirm what I’d shared. She came back a few minutes later and at least apologized. I wasn’t told how long I’d wait but I was told to go to the waiting room. While there, the woman I spoke with the first day saw me and kindly apologized. She really made an effort to smooth the situation over. When my car was ready, though, I had no coupon for a free wash, which is what I was promised multiple times. It just seemed like such a bizarre experience for a simple service. Why promise these things for customers if this is the follow-through? I wish I could say it was a great service but unfortunately this is what happened. As I write this review, there is no way for me to be sure I can even be contacted by someone to remedy the situation, which is also disappointing. Kevin had sold us the car and was fantastic. He was quick but thorough. We were very happy with sales. This service experience is definitely a contrast.  ",1,13,0,0

993,527,25-Nov-18,Took my truck to Gunn Chevrolet for a dead battery. Purchased a new one in 2016 from Gunn. TOld me it would take 20 minutes. After waiting 2 hours service department tells me battery was out of warranty and needs a new one! They hadn’t even started replacing it yet! Claimed they sold me an 18 month battery. Weird thought it said 30 on the side. 2 1/2 hours it was finally done for $199.00 and witha fresh 30 month warranty that will turn into a 18 month I guess. When I complained Matthew rolled his eyes and chuckled and turned his back on me. I called the name on the receipt to give them my satisfaction rating as it states. Sorry sir he doesn’t work here anymore! Plenty of Chevy dealers around to take your money stay away from Gunn service department! ,1,13,0,0

So I text again, the day of expiration and they were in but he forgot to call me. I went to pick up when I was promised my sales rep would deliver to me. However, that wasn’t the issue.

1018,553,06-Sep-19,"When I personally expressed my displeasure(s) directly to Stonebriar Chevrolet's Service Director (you can look-up his name yourself), he informed me that because my ""classic"" Corvette is not valued at $100K, nor under warranty, I did not receive ""priority service"" for the 2 1/2 weeks that it was in their Service Department. I am now acutely aware that I have been bringing my car to the WRONG dealership for service. I will NOT make this mistake again! And, if I may add....my Corvette Club co-members will be informed of my inferior experience(s).

Also, in addition to the exorbitant amount of time that they possessed my Corvette, (regardless of me having to furnish them with a part, 2 1/2 weeks is unacceptable by any stretch of the imagination) when it was finally returned to me: 1. Not all of my requested work had been completed within the timeframe. 2. An unknown cable was hanging-down in front of my gas/brake pedal and when I asked, nobody could/would tell me what it was. 3. The panel underneath my steering column, (where work was done) was left loose, with only one, of two, screws engaged. 4. My custom-installed manual antenna switch was nowhere to be found. When I told the Service Director that it was missing, he informed me that it had not been there when I left them my car and that I should return my car to the original ""installation shop"" for re-evaluation. Upon my further insistence, the car was taken back into the dealership's shop area, re-evaluated, and the switch ""mysteriously"" re-appeared under my dash and the panel (second screw) had been firmly attached. 4. While driving my car home, I noticed that my hood was rattling. When I arrived home, I found that the hood had not been fully closed when the car was returned to me.  

Mind you....this is ALL after having my car in their Service Department for 2 1/2 weeks. Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy....with minimal attention to detail!

At this point, I do NOT need some ""canned"" PC response from Stonebriar Chevrolet Management, saying that they are sorry for their shoddy workmanship, that they can do better, and/or for them to furnish me with a phone number to call them to further discuss my displeasure with their Service Operations. I have already discussed this at a ""Director"" level with them, and there was no misunderstanding regarding my sentiments of dissatisfaction. The reason for my review herein, is so that just in case my grievances did not make it beyond the Director-level, somebody at Stonebriar Chevrolet can read about my (and others') poor experience(s) in a public forum and possibly come to the realization that they are losing customers, (i.e. $$$) due to the atmosphere and aura of dysfunction that permeates their Service Department.

We bought the vehicle with an added cost of $395 for the window tint. 
The next day my son called to let me know we had been snookered!  Upon closer examination it was clear the window tint was not a “dealer added extra”.

Since the Internet Sales Manager was not in, another salesperson helped me. After the test drive, I said I’ll take the truck – it was what I wanted and the price was fair.

1041,578,23-Mar-20,"While traveling through Lewisville in my Chevrolet pickup pulling a car trailer, the engine began cycling between overheating and cooling. Initially, I suspected a faulty gauge, but finally decided it must be a faulty thermostat that was opening and closing. I finally exited the highway and opened the hood to find an engine that was spewing steam and smoke. Since it was late in the afternoon and Huffines Chevrolet was 5 minutes away and I assumed they had space to store my trailer, I chose to take the truck there for inspection and repair. 

They called 3 days later with their assessment. According to their bid, the truck needed a new water pump ($349.20), new thermostat ($28.02), new temperature sensor ($74.88), new clutch fan ($259.32), coolant service ($149.95), 8 hours of labor at $150/hr ($1,200.96), and tax and shop supplies for a total of $2,182.26. I immediately became suspicious, so I called the auto repair shop I normally use, Pursur Auto Repair in Denton, to get a bid. Their bid for the exact same parts and labor was $516 plus a $125 wrecker fee. 

Pursur picked up the truck around noon the following day after I paid $105 to Huffines for an inspection fee. Around 4 PM, Pursur Automotive called to say the truck was repaired. And the problem? A faulty $10 thermostat. That’s all. No need for a new water pump, a new temperature sensor (which the service advisor said was melted), a new clutch fan, or 8 hours of labor. Pursur’s repair and inspection included pressure testing to make sure there were no head cracks or other damages resulting from the overheated engine, flushing the cooling system, and adding new coolant. The cost to drive away was $164.83 plus a $125 wrecker fee. I’ve driven the truck over 100 miles since then and experienced no mechanical issues. 

I should add that Nik Baker, the Huffines service advisor, called 30 minutes after I told him that Pursur would be coming to get the truck and he offered to lower their bid to $1,300 (or something close). I don’t remember the exact offer he made because I wasn’t interested in conducting business with his organization at that point. 

I should also add that I shared the facts of the event with Alan Moore, the Huffines Service Manager, and asked for a refund of the $105 inspection fee and reimbursement for the $125 wrecker fee paid to Pursur Auto. To his credit, he authorized a check for $230. I agreed to take the truck to the dealership so he could inspect it and to pick up the check at the same time. Prior to going to the dealership, he had quizzed his mechanics about their assessment of damages. During their initial inspection, the mechanics apparently replaced the heat sensor module, but didn’t make note of doing so. Upon inspection, Alan noted that the heat sensor appeared to be new, so the claim that the heat sensor was melted may have been accurate. 

I prefer not to make subjective observations in a public forum, but I can’t spin this experience in any way that makes Huffines look good.

One good thing he did, however, was that he allow my daughter to stop by and test drive the vehicle for me.  When discussing the trade-in of our vehicle, things went a little sour.  They are not willing to give a little on the trade.  My vehicle was in top shape, we were the only owners and it didn't seem to matter.  On top of the trade-in, they were not willing to budge on the buying price of the vehicle we were purchasing.  We ended up making the purchase, but only because we didn't want to go through it again.  If I had it to do over again, I would have sold my vehicle on my own for a higher price and used a different salesman.  Mr. Dawson is a great guy but the comments were uncalled for.  ""I'm not going to lie to you..."", ""I don't care if you buy the vehicle or not..."", things like that.

1043,581,25-Jan-18,"So I hate leaving a bad review under someone who didn't directly cause my problem, however since the employee who was responsible, Alex Alfaro, isn't listed on this site I feel it's appropriate for me to leave this review under the manager since this is under his watch ultimately. 

So I had a 4:15 appointment with Craig Martin to test drive a 2017 Malibu. I was already pre-approved through Capital One, and came into the used sales office with my finance papers in hand, ready to test drive and buy. As I come in, Alex greets me at the door and I let him know I have a 4:15 appointment with Craig. Alex let me know that Craig was with a customer, but would let him know I was there and then walked off. I then proceed to wait for an hour and a half with no acknowledgement from any of the other sales staff, most of whom were sitting around and watching videos on Youtube (as I could hear the annoying screams and laughter from the videos and see the reflections on the windows) outside from Greg who offered me a bottle of water. To add to my frustration, Alex actually came back into the office about 1 hour into my wait, makes eye contact, sees that I am still waiting, and then proceeds to leave again without saying anything to anyone or offering to help me. 

Eventually Craig steps away from his customers to ask if I'm waiting for anything, at which point I tell him that I was there for our 4:15 appointment. He then frantically apologies, gets me over to Greg, and then everything proceeds normally for a car purchase. In regards to the actual sales experience, it was okay. To be honest, my view of the actual sales process is pretty tainted due to my frustration.
Ultimately, the only reason I stayed was because I really wanted that car, and knew it would likely be a fast seller.

They discovered that the tire had been patched and air was leaking around the patch, and that I would need a new tire.... to the tune of $270.  I called Lithia and spoke to a manager (Michael) and explained my problem.  He too said, the car sold ""as is"" and ""sorry"" they could not help me.  My total bill was $437.45.  Lithia ""certified"" the car before I drove it off the lot.  Doesn't that mean they checked it out?  Doesn't it mean they should have at least noticed that I did not have a lug key?  I even think they should have discovered that the tire could not hold air.  The car I bought was a 2018 Dodge Charger with 19,900 miles on it.  I am very UN happy with customer service.  They wanted me happy before I signed the papers, but they don't really care about me now that the deal is done.  Besides this:  They got me in the door because they promised that they had located the very car I was searching for online.  When they contacted us, they said it was someplace in another town, but couldn't tell me where it was.  Then when I drove to Lithia, they said, ""oh, it just sold"", and offered me what they had on their lot.  Why did I fall for that???  I will never buy another car from Lithia and any chance I get, I will tell my story.",1,16,0,0

I hope the manager of the detailing service department and owner of this dealership see this review because our entire family WAS SO DISAPPOINTED. We have nine in our family.
Yall should truly consider how a customer feels when purchasing a car-it  is an investment and should be treated with great care especially when someone is purchasing for the first time. Made me sick to see it so nasty- the kid went from excited to seeing that still nasty... What a shame.

I have always received GREAT service until the last year or so. Getting my oil changed has become a pain and no one every returns a phone call.

Well, on May 16 I was driving and my van wouldn't accelerate at a green light but the engine was reeving - figured something was wrong with my transmission. Got the van to a parking lot on the A&M campus and call Chrysler's Roadside assistance. They sent a tow truck. While I was waiting received a rude call from the service advisor because he had to open a ticket since he was notified my from Chrysler my van was coming.  That was at around 1pm. At around 2pm the tow truck came for the van.

I waited most of the day on Thursday, May 17 to hear that they had my van and what was up. At 3pm I caved and called. I was told they would have my service advisor call me.

Friday, May 17, I called at 10am to find out if they had my van and again was told that they would ask my service advisor to call me . I called back at 3:30 because I needed to know if my van actually got to the service center or not. The service witch board staff member hunted someone down who confirmed my van was there and said they would put in a notice to have my service advisor call me back.

On Monday, May 21st I called at 10am to see if someone could tell me something. I in no means was expecting my car to be fixed in less than a week but some information, communication would have been nice. Again told they would ping my service advisor to call me.

On Wednesday, May 23rd at 5:01pm received a phone call from my service advisor who told me ""Bad News, your transmission is shot. I won't be able to tell you anything else until Friday at the earliest. I'm thinking you are telling me nothing I didn't already no but ok.

Friday, May 25th comes and goes with no information. I give them the benefit of the doubt that Monday is a holiday and I'll hear something on Tuesday, May 29. No surprise at this point - crickets.

I just called at 11am this morning, May 23, and was informed, you guessed it they would let my service advisor know I called and he would give me a call back!!!!!

Never have I been given a two week run around about what is wrong with my car. No request to authorize work, what it might cost me - NOTHING at All.

Communication between Charles and us was about as minimal as you can get. Unless we called him we could never get any information. The vehicle is a 2017 Dodge Caravan with a full bumper to bumper extended warranty mind you. On November 13th we were told that the warranty would not cover anything on the vehicle and we would need to pay the entire $5000+ service bill before we could take the van. When asked how this could be Charles told us ""because your warranty refused to cover the repairs"". I contacted the warranty company to inquire why this was. So on or about the 8th of November they (the warranty company) sent out an inspector who took pictures of everything but couldn't approve the needed repairs because the mileage couldn't be validated. They needed the van to power up to verify that we were within the mileage to approve.  So IPAC did the repair and the warranty company sent out a 2nd inspector to approve the completed repairs. When the 2nd inspector got there and he inspected the vehicle he could tell that the repairs that IPAC said they did, they didn't do. So they refused the repairs and that's when they tried to get us to pay for them.

The other day my cars engine randomly seized. I took it to the manufacturers dealership to get a full diagnostic and they found that our vehicle was 2 quarts OVER the recommended amount which they concluded caused the engine to fail. They could not find anything else wrong with the car besides that. We checked oil change records and IPAC had been adding way more then required for the last 2 or 3 oil changes. I've heard that their service department DOES NOT care for vehicles properly but gave them the benefit of the doubt... When you take your car in for service you expect the service to be made exactly what is required, nothing more nothing less and it's obvious that doesn't happen at IPAC. To make matters worse when we confronted them about the issue they told us that they MIGHT be able to cover a measly 20% of the damages but before that they had to escalate the situation to management. Two weeks pass by and I'm told employee that IPAC will not help with the repairs after all and that it was my fault because I should have checked to see that the service was properly done.

After speaking with Jared, the service manager, he informed us the exhaust pipe somehow cracked on the short 20 minute drive from their dealership back to our house and wanted to charge us $1300 more to fix it and an additional 2-3 days to get the work done. I find this extremely hard to believe given the fact that my teenage daughter heard the noise as soon as she drove off the lot. Obviously they did NOT properly inspect the vehicle before releasing it to us. I am thankful that my young teenage daughter did not get in an accident on the drive home. They refused any compensation or responsibility. We will NEVER purchase nor service a vehicle with IPAC again.",1,17,0,0
1117,661,12-Feb-18,I am writing this review because I have received 0 response after the multiple tries reaching out to Chrysler/Dodge at Ingram park. In December I had my car serviced due to every time it rained water would leak thru the roof leaving a stain and the smell of mildew. When I called it was my understanding it was under the manufacturer's warranty but was told they wouldn't work on it right away so I decided to bring it after the holidays. When I dropped off the vehicle it was suddenly over the manufacturers warranty and they made me pay out of pocket. Then when I picked up the vehicle I noticed a huge scratch on the door. I told the worker that scratch was not there and took a picture of it right in front of him. He tried to say it wasn't a scratch but if it was I could call and bring it back. Well I called and they told me to send an email to chernandez@ipacchrysler.com. Never got a single response. Called back again and was told to send an email to the head of the service department jwilde@ipacchrysler.com. After serval more emails still no response. I just want the scratch fixed. So people beware their service department has been more than just shady. I would never recommend them. Avoid at all cost. ,1,17,0,0
1118,662,14-Nov-17,Horrible experience! I bought a 2017 Dodge 2500 Longhorn Laramie MegaCab. Love my truck. Took my truck to get washed from the IPAC Detail/ wash care center and it came back with black finger mark smudges on the interior of my fold down mirrors and roof. The vacuum they used had grease on it so my carpets and back sides of my seats had lines where they drug the vacuum nozzle. My door handle had a scuff on it that went all the way down to the primer. I mentioned it to the management and he said that my kids made the finger marks and i prolly hit my door on something. This truck is garage kept and rarely driven due to my job schedule.  I then took my truck to get the door handle touched up at the IPAC paint and body shop. Now the door handle comes back with bubbles in the paint and my door weather strip torn. ,1,17,0,0

Looks like I am just reiterating what everyone else has experienced at this dealership but here we go.
After inquiring (via ramtrucks.com) I was called by the dealership (Judy) and setup an appointment.  I drove an hour to make my appointment on time and on schedule showing the respect for their time that I expect to be shown for mine.  I was introduced to Judy (gatekeeper) and was quickly assigned to one of the hoard of salesmen that stared lustily at any potential victim who drove into the parking lot.  It was strikingly reminiscent of a combination of ""The Walking Dead"" and picking up day laborers in the HomeDepot parking lot.

I was then informed that the particular unit I had inquired about, being the only unit that met MOST of my requirements and all of my preferences, was unavailable as they were lifting it and putting oversized tires on it.  Since I am simple man who has come to terms with my stature, hairline, and masculinity I had no need of a lifted truck.  

I was at this point very incensed asked why I had been invited to drive an hour for no particular purpose.  The salesman assured me they had lots of units that would meet my needs even though he had no clue what those were.  He invited me to get into his vehicle and wander through their remote lot looking at random trucks.  I then recommended we complete a computer search of their stock with my particular requirements.  He was a confused by my idea of using tools to expedite the process and insisted we go wandering about in hopes of stumbling across something that might interest me.
At this point I was done with them and walked away.  I was glad I still had my keys and could make a speedy get away before the minions revolted and feasted upon brains.",1,17,0,0

No calls back, left messages with no response. Got tired and decided I'd be best off taking my business elsewhere. They wanted to charge $900 for parts and labor on one part.

I felt disrespected and I thought about walking out.  I should have walked out. After I refused her offer, she was quick to match the offer I brought in. Even though I came in with my own financing, she insisted on getting me to finance through the dealer. That included more waiting. She eventually sent me off to financing when I met a pleasant lady. Within 10 minutes of being in her office, we were interrupted twice to see if I was financing through the dealership. After her failed attempt, I paid my down payment and waited for Jennifer. More waiting. After she became available, she took me to my truck and showed me how to hook up the bluetooth. I asked her if my truck came with a care package ( nitrogen, lifetime tint, etc) and she wasnt sure if I purchased it. Instead of finding out, she left and that was it. My truck wasnt freshly washed nor was it pulled to the front of the building; It was in the parking lot with a bunch of irrelevant papers stuffed in the glove box.

I emailed her and emailed her and she never responded. Finally, I emailed someone else and she got Jennifer to respond to my emails.

I bring it back on Monday and they informed me that they ordered and changed the wrong part and that they would have to order the correct part and try again and keep in mind i told them i was due at work in Pennsylvania on November 3rd. They informed me that the parts are going to take couple days to come in and that there’s nothing that they can do and I just have to be patient. Needless to say i lost my job position.

1220,776,10-Jul-19,"In April I received an oil change and I asked the associate to have the mechanic check one of my tires because I was losing air pressure. I was informed by Johnathan that the tire could not be repaired and that I needed to buy a brand new tire that cost $170. I refused and asked for them to put the tire back on. I picked up my car with out any issues, so I thought. Fast forward to Wednesday 6/3, my tire started to lose pressure again and I took it to a tire shop. When they asked me for the key to the rims, I went in the glove compartment where the mechanic left it and there was no key in the container. I went to the dealership immediately and was told by Jonathan that I needed to come back Thursday morning so that the Manager can order new parts. I arrived this morning at 0830. About 20 minutes later. Johnathan gave me a new set and said that they match the ones I have on my car even after I asked him was he sure. I left and went straight to the tire shop and waited 2 hours for them to tell me the key didn’t match. I went back to the dealership very upset and crying hysterically when I was told I needed to leave my car and it would be a few hours. The only person that came to calm me down was a sales rep that actually sold me my car, Jaron. I received the rental at 1230 and I didn’t get my car back until 1630. I asked to speak with the manager and when I spoke with him he just looked at me as if I was speaking a different language. I expressed to him everything that happened and that this was the worse customer service I have ever experienced. He just nodded his head and said ok without an apology. My parents referred me to the dealership and I referred my niece but I will no longer do business or refer anyone else to the dealership. This was a big inconvenience and very time consuming.

1236,795,15-May-19," I had to drop off my truck for an oil leak diagnosis. It was apparently found but took about a week to fix. I was called to pick it up. Then immediately called again to cancel my pickup. Leak sprung again. Redo. Days later, called to pickup. I picked up my truck, leak sprung a few days later, while I was away for work. Brought it back as soon as I could. Again, leak diagnosed and took about a week to fix. I picked it up and the leak sprung again the next day. I hesitated to bring it back but my advisor Gary convinced me to. Gary was very professional and much help before, so I agreed. This time, he brought in a specialist to diagnose it. They found the real leak. I supposed it was in a harder-to-reach area than the tech would’ve liked to check. Due to it being in that area, I was told it would at least take ten days. Things had to be taken out and whatnot. When I finally picked it up, I checked the summary and inspected my truck as I always do. Things usually line up. This time they did not. The summary stated a 13 mile road test had been done. But 80 miles were put on the odometer, half a tank of fuel had been burned, and the took of my black truck had white paint rubbed on top. Only caused by running through a clearance that is too low. Joyride or whatever you wanna call it. I went back inside before driving at all and confronted the service advisor staff, including the manager at the last desk. They agreed that i was right about what it looked like. Unfortunately, they shrugged it off as an “oh well, xxxx happens” moment. Said nothing could be done for me since neither Gary, the diesel tech, nor the reimbursement guy were there. And that I could go back the next day if I wanted to be reimbursed for the fuel. I told them that I didn’t care about the $30 fuel reimbursement and that I wondered if that there were anything that could be done to convince me to keep my service here, if they cared about it. Once again I was met with blank stares. I’ve got a 2017 Cummins and a 2014 Charger and I would buy all my parts here and get any service I couldn’t do myself here. Now i’ll Go out of my way to river oaks or Dickinson. Wherever I can find decent service without my truck being someone’s toy. I would’ve given 0 stars, but Gary was very helpful.

After an hour and a half of walking around outside i went in and tried to get an update from Steve. That arrogant jerk ignored me and acted as if i was not in front of him taking a call just pushing me off. But as soon as a young woman walked in the door he was quick to hang up and try to bend over backwards for her. So i asked that someone else help. Got the update from Luis. He came back and said the tech cleared the code and drove my truck 3 miles to see if the sensor would reset. I was worried because I have the progressive snapshot plugged in so I checked it. The logged report said the vehicle was on for about 2 minutes and that was when they moved it to the back. I asked how did they drive it if it was only on 2 minutes and I was outside the whole time never saw the truck leave. They could not answer. They said they fixed the sensor and let me go.

1245,804,26-Mar-19,"I purchased my previous vehicle (2015 Chrysler 200) from her in 2015 and my salesperson at that time was Tyrone (he is so awesome).  I knew I was in need of another car (high mileage) and Juana called me about a special deal that was going on at the dealership so I decided to go in.

Juana was very patient, kind, empathic, and was listened to my every need.  I advised her of my budget and she worked hard at trying to get me the deal that I wanted; however she wasn’t successful.  She asked if I could meet with one of her managers about making a deal for me that I would be willing to compromise with and I agreed.

One of the managers, Alexis, approached me and advised me of two options that I had.  After I explained to him that neither option would work, he offered some unethical suggestions (i.e. stop paying on my current vehicle and just make payments on the new car) for me to consider so that he could make the deal.  He also stated that it really wouldn’t matter if I stop making payments on my car because my credit wasn’t the best (my credit is fair).  When I refused to follow suite, he returned back to his office to see if there were other options for me to consider.  At this point, I was irritated, frustrated, and overall disrespected at the horrible customer service I received from someone who is a manager.  I asked Juana for my keys and my id because I was ready to go and she obliged my request.

She walked me to my car and I advised Juana that it wasn’t her that I had an issue with, it was Alexis and the way he treated me (I did use a few choice words about my feelings and experience with the manager).  I explained to her that I didn’t like how he spoke to me, how he approached me with the deal, and how he attempted to belittle me about the decision that I was making towards the deal.  I told her that I did have a positive outlook on this place; however it has changed with me working with him.  She acknowledged my feelings and respected my decision.

Once I was getting ready to leave, another sales person approved me, Armando, who overheard some of the conversation that I had with Juana.  I explained to him the interaction that I had with Alexis and how I refused to be treated like that from someone who wants my business and that it was best for me to leave.  He acknowledged my feelings as well and provided his professional opinion about the deal. 

After leaving the dealership and evaluating my decision, I contacted Juana and was able to make a compromise (where I didn’t have to deal with Alexis) regarding the sale of the vehicle.  I was able to make my purchase and not interact with that manager in the process.  I was able to leave the dealership with what I wanted, which worked out at the end.

If it wasn’t for Tyrone, Juana, Armando, and Ms. Denise (in finance), I wouldn’t recommend this dealership nor would I have purchased my car from here again.  My suggestion would be to offer Alexis to attend customer service training, respect customers’ decisions, morals, and ethical beliefs, don’t approach deals with unethical recommendations, and be cognitive of the words that are being used when he is communicating with customers.

I had called ahead to tell them what we saw online and to have the vehicle ready for us to look at and they gave us the name of a salesman to speak with when we arrived. We arrived at the dealership and the salesman was busy so we were then told to speak with Anwar, who never actually introduced himself as I had to ask for his name after we left. We looked at the car and automatically didn’t like it because it was a smokers vehicle and then looked at another and test drove it. As we got into the car to test drive, the manager saw us in the vehicle with the salesman and said, “This looks like a crime waiting to happen. A white man, a black man, and two asian girls.” I could not believe that racist remark came out of the manager’s mouth but we just ignored it at the time.  The vehicle we test drove was an Infiniti and the salesman knew nothing about the vehicle but the obvious features. We brought up seat warmers and he didn’t even know if the car had them and brushed it off like nothing. We got back from the test drive and talked about the car and ultimately decided it was not the perfect car so we weren’t going to try and buy the vehicle and when we said we didn’t like something about the car, the salesman was very rude with his responses. I did not like the fact that the vehicle was a rental and had many drivers in and out of the vehicle and the salesman gave us strong attitude when I said that and said, “Well what are you expecting with a used car?” Then the disrespectful salesman thanked us for wasting his time and then asked if we would talk to his manager so he “wouldn’t get in trouble”. We went and talked to the racist manager who was slightly nicer, although he questioned our opinions on the vehicle and that was very disrespectful and uncouth as that just made the situation worse. When we specifically told the manager we wanted seat warmers, he said, “Really? Seat warmers in Texas?” Ironically is was 40 degrees that morning. So then we left and went on our two hour journey home as we came from out of town. The next day my friend realized she couldn’t find her license and wondered if the salesman had given it back we he made a copy for the test drive. Well I call and turns out he left the license in the copy machine so we asked if they would mail it back as we live two hours out of town. They said they would and almost two weeks later she still hadn’t received her license. So I call again a week later after them not answering the phone once and they said they still have the license and will send it out soon. Well she finally got it one and a half weeks later after that phone call with no sort of explanation or apology. Overall, I am absolutely not pleased with the horrendous experience I had at Gulfgate Dodge and would never buy a new or used vehicle from Gulfgate. Unprofessional staff is absolutely unacceptable and I refuse to tolerate it.",1,18,0,0

However, the price sheet brought back to me was roughly $3500 more than the price advertised online (which is why I came to your dealership...the advertised price).  Jaron explained the warranty that was added to the car, he also mentioned it was a way for the dealership to recoup some of the labor cost for prepping the vehicle.  After I told him I was not going to pay more than the advertised price, he got his manager.  His manager confirmed that he would not sell the car for less than the elevated warranty price.

After the director's departure, I continued discussions with Jaron, I expressed my displeasure of the bait and switch tactic.  Jaron began to tell me I was a bad consumer because if I didn't pay the elevated price I was preventing him from supporting his daughter.  This was the absolute worst sales tactic I have ever seen.

At this point I walked out of the Used Car building and went straight to NEw Car building asking for the GM.  I met a gentleman named, I believe his name was Carl, whom I explained my entire experience with.  HE left me for a minute, I assume to speak with Jaron and his team.

I wasn’t certain where to go from there so stood around for a few minutes. After a few mins of no assistance, I walked up to the gentleman ‘s desk closest to the entrance and as I tried to ask if I needed to sign in he immediately said “there are two other people in front of you”. No welcome, we’ll be with you shortly, just short direct comment as if he was already overwhelmed in his day. 
I just stood around until a young gentleman took the initiative to ask if I needed assistance, as he probably could see the list look on my face. He apologized for the wait, asked for my name and what assistant was he could help with. I let him know if my scheduled appointment and he looked up who I was assigned to. He took me over to Luis’s desk, pointed him out, as he was outside helping another customer, and said he would be with me afterwards.

He went on to explain they did all they could for my wheel alignment but I would need to take my vehicle to a body shop. He then let me know he would not charge me the full price, as if he were doing me a favor. I asked a few additional questions but could see that we weren’t going anywhere.

1274,836,30-Sep-18,"My expreience has been Super Pathetic post visiting the Dealership. I was looking for a Resale Car. Searching through Cargurus it directed me to this Website GulfGateDodge for a Nissan Altima 2017 with 11000 Miles for a price of $12995. I saw there was no accident reported. I called the dealer on 29th Sep and the person who picked up the call asked for the Stock Number.829339A. She confirmed , yes the vehcile is available but as the Dealership is Closed on Saturdays , I can only look at the car the next day Sunday. She asked me what time I intend to come. I said around 11.30am on 30 Sep. She said ""Joe"" would be my Contact person. On Sunday the dealership called around 11.30 to check if I am going to visit or not. I said Sorry I am late but I would be there around 12.30-12.45pm. She confirmed sounds good , and my contact person now would be ""Xavian"". I reach the dealership and searched for Xavian where he said he is busy with a Customer and someone else would assist me. I waited for around 10 mins and was greeted by an extremely fine person Mr.Raul. I had to explain and give the stock number specifically which I have come for. He was unable to find the stock and said in that case the car might be in workshop. I was a bit surprised a car which was in Stock for Sale for 43 days is in workshop. I requested him to verify. After 10 mins he came back with a ""Sorry message that the car is Sold the previous day."" I was amazed. I said but your dealership is Closed on Saturdays. Then he said the Sales Person sold the car on Friday and did the Delivery on Saturday. I was Extremely Disappointed with the False Information and sheer headache of travelling 20miles to hear this crap. I said can I meet the Manager. I went with him and the Manager said he will come in sometime. I waited more than 15 mins. Then another person Jimmy informed the Manager again. After 10 mins I was asked to go to his desk. There the fun starts. I told him the list of events and I was shocked to hear his response. Here I quote George Nabbout "" We do not update the inventory so frequently in the Website/Internet. Moreover these inventory may may not be there but once the Customer is here then we try to sell whatever inventory we have. These Internet Inventory & Pricing is to Attract Customers"". I asked why dont you put ""Pending Sale"" , he said since our inventory is too low it does not make to update every minute by minute Inventory status . For him it meant its fine to give incorrect information to Customers as they are to attract Customers. I was Super Upset. I was thinking what crap dealership , what is the difference between roadside Dealerships and these big branded ones. Then I thought to come back to get his name for Review. When I came , obviously I was frustrated , I said "" Your names please"" , he said ""george"" , can you please give me the full name. Then he gave me his Business Card. Then I was leaving & he called ""excuse me"" and said in extremely rude manner "" why are you giving me such a ""f*** o**"" look & some more derogatory words"" I said back. I don't think I ever said those words nor my action prompted those behavior, I requested you to speak outside so that there is no scene amongst your customers & subordinates just in case you are a Manager."" His words"" I have nothing to hide , I have 4 College Degress, and from your appearance it seems you are also educated college degrees & .....( that I have means & resources). I dont know how many years you are in this country but I am here for 30 years & lot of jibber jabber.."" . I said again ""I have not done anything derogatory nor shouted nor raised my voice unlike you are ,  yes I am very upset and angry and I feel cheated because of wrong information which for you was super casual as it is your part of normal business cycle"". Then he said ""Yes that specific deal was a steal , i know $13000, 11k miles Altima , anybody will grab for it. I dont think you will die if you dont get that car today. I am sure this probably is going to be 2nd or 3rd car just because its a steal deal. If you want I can call you once we have such cars and miles & you can come."" I actually was super upset with his way of behaviour , I left my name and number. But inside I was sure never to visit this dealership ever.  And the best part , all time he was sitting in his chair , there was not even a chair for the Customer . Hence I was standing & he was blabbering sitting. Being in a Customer Service industry I really feel pity for him. He is really lucky to have a very good Manager else by now I would have fired him , a very can be very good at his target n numbers but a person with wrong attitude can spoil the name & create a bad atmosphere for other team members & the organization Goals.. I feel extremely sad for this Organization & Leaders .. My advice , DO NOT visit the dealership directly if you have some stock seen over the internet. Speak with a Sales Person & verify if the stock # & price is there. I saw some Google Reviews where few have complained that , they even has bumped up the price & did not honor website pricing. There seems to be an integrity issue with this dealership , hence visit at your own risk & luck. This happened specific to ""Pre Owned Car"" Division.",1,18,0,0

I let them know that Bayway replaced a computer part, and the part was most likely bad because the problem started happening immediately after the part was replaced.

I called again today and asked about the same car and added another one I was interested in. I called they gave me the listing price and told me they would call me back to work out a deal. Of course I have not been called back. Terrible business. Terrible salesman. I offered to buy the car and I was told no. Spoke to at least 5-6 people about the same car and no one was willing to even try and sell it. Basically got ignored. ",1,18,0,0

We test drove a JGC 25th Sterling Edition in red but I told the Sales Rep Chris that we were interested in white.  Chris showed us several models and then convinced us to go inside and look at inventory and see if he could get us a good deal given it was mother's day and there was an extra $1k rebate. Found a white a 2017 Limited but they didn’t have it (although site said they had 6). Asked to price a JGC High Altitude. We submitted info to look at numbers. Sales Manager Mike Chapa came and gave us initial numbers with rates possibly less than 5%. At one point we mentioned just looking at numbers and weren’t thinking of buying...Mike immediately pushed his chair back and was about to stand up to leave when I stopped him and said we were discussing numbers. Obviously our time was not worth his. At that moment I advised them that the info on the sheet was not correct as we were interested in the white JGC and not the red JGC. Mike pulled up the correct information and notated all the rebates and said no worries its about the same so it’s fine. We had asked for a lower rate so he went back again. When he came back we again discussed rates but also advised him that we could get a better rate with our bank. He said ok and that he would re-verify rebates. He left again. At this time Chris (who has been more than awesome throughout this whole thing) comes and tells us Mike had agreed to the price and since our bank was closed they would let us sign the paper with the agreed amount, take the vehicle and then come back during the week to finalize the transaction. Chris advised that the $1k rebate for Mother’s Day had not been added and I also advised that I didn’t feel comfortable signing without the correct vehicle information being listed. He went back to have everything corrected only to have Mike come back and tell us the price was now $3k more because they realized there was a difference. My husband told him we had identified from the beginning which vehicle we were looking at and that he stated it was about the same but he stated he never said such a thing. Needless to say we walked out only to be called later by Mike, who left a voicemail, stating they would do the deal at the price we agreed but yet when we called back Chris tells us Mike told him to tell us they would do it for $4400 more. Tried speaking to Mike the next day; he tried blaming Chris for everything but I corrected him and told him Chris was not at fault; he began to yell and then hung up on me. Spoke to the General Sales Manager Ryan Martin who stated he had heard about the situation and had asked Mike to call to accept the price. He stated he would look further into it, take a look at the numbers and would call back within 45mins...it’s been 2 days and no call back. Overall Chris was great; invested his time on us even though we weren’t completely sure we’d be buying that day. Mike on the other hand obviously didn’t want to take the time with us, his word is worthless; unprofessional and rude.

The absolute WORST place to purchase a vehicle. The staff doesn't communicate, managers don't return calls and don't take your concerns seriously, oh and how could I forget DON'T APPRECIATE YOUR BUSINESS. 

Andrew Cordova, GM? Hm, you couldn't get the GM to answer the phone even if your life depended on it.

The Finance guy in Used Cars, Ryan? I don't know which habit it worst, lying or not returning people's calls.

Our Salesman Mike? How could I forget! He forgot us after we purchased our used vehicle. Dodging calls after making excuse after excuse. 

Christian in Used Sales? Pathetic Car Salesman who is dumbfounded at any and all questions.

My husband and I walked into that dealership with a trade in and put our application in with Ryan to drive out with a 17' Dually and a 15' Charger. Well, turns out all we got was the xxxxing run around. We were told approval for both of the vehicles THEN we were told only the charger but that he could FOR SURE get us into the SLT 2500 buuuut the next day told us that we couldn't get into it despite his promise SO he told us we could get into a car as long as it was under $35000 SO we pick a 17' Jeep for 31,9 and even with a co-signer this guy promised he could get me in it and even let me drive it off the lot. 4 days later (mind you, they never called us to update us) we call and call to get a hold of someone and when we do (Christian) he informed us that we were approved and in the single digits. GREAT RIGHT!? No. We called later on the way up there and he informed us that he was misinformed and I wasn't approved. I was pissed. After sitting in that lobby for 5 hours Thursday, which have Salesman running around cussing and not acting professional while I have my toddler with me I was ready to be done. I am waiting for a gift card currently that we were advertised and promise up until signing when everyone decided to not even return our calls, not like they did in the first place. I have been waiting for about 3 weeks now. It is advertised and promised at signing but yet no one will acknowledge our xxxxty customer service, unbeknownst to them, right? Wrong. My husband has reached out to Mr. Cordova and let me tell you that this man can't return a call if your life depended on it. 

The dealership is flawed to say the least but the real crack in the foundation comes down to the staff. 

Don't waste your time. Don't waste the trip because all you'll get is disappointment and empty promises from incompetent Salesman just making a buck.

I purchased a 2017 Chevrolet equinox  07/06/2017 and the advertised sale price online was $19,800. When I got home, I realized the sale price on the contract said $22,800 which is $3000 above the Internet price. The next day I called the dealership and let them know why was the sale price change from $19,800 to $22,800 and they stated because there was a mandatory warranty that I had to purchase. I advised them that I didn't want that warranty and they told me it was mandatory or else they weren't going to be able to honor the Internet price. I let them know that they can't force me to purchase a warranty or service contract if I don't want to and they simply stated that it was too late I already agreed and signed the contract. I know it was my fault for not verifying the numbers on the contract but this dealership operates with deceptive practices in order to increase their profits and they hide everything from you and just make you sign really quick.

We were down to financial information and I received a text saying “I think I got this done; just waiting on your financial info”. I sent it within 2 min of that text. I was supposed to head over there after work at 6 pm. He seemed very helpful and determined to get this done for me. The sales manager had also become involved to help us get this price right....
NO SOONER did I send the financial information, I received an email “SOLD SOLD! Just wanted to let you know that another salesperson sold the Wrangler we were working on, to a customer that was in this morning and the.n came back”. No apology; no “I’m so sorry”. NOTHING! We had been working on this sale for 48 hours. An apology would have been nice. I will never deal with this dealership again. I took my business to the dodge dealership in McKinney; where the salesman immediately put a “sold” sticker on it, with my name; while we see if we can get this done to fit my financial requirements. 
So just know; if you deal with Huffines Dodge in Lewisville; you may have your chosen vehicle sold out from under you! And if you do; there will be NO apology or anything done to help make it right. He didn’t even guide me to a possible alternative purchase or help me in anyway. Not even a follow up email. Disappointed to have been treated this way.",1,19,0,0

Last week I was leaving the country on a business trip so I dropped my truck and asked them to go ahead and do repairs while am gone and I dont need a loner. After 7 days I come back and truck still nothing done to it. I asked the reason and they said I had to approve  100 dollars deductible before they  do anything. These repairs had been explained to me many times during oil change and warranty and my deductible was known on contract from beginning and It was explained to me upon dropping truck at shop.

1346,914,23-Dec-19,"For Reference (the Manager with the worst attitude and customer service ever) if he was even a manager was Scott Spindle.

I went in to get an Oil Change, replace a run light and get a recall done on my car at Huffines Lewisville near my work.

Was told they didn't want to take the time to do the paperwork and get me a rental car for the Recall on my car. They said can you wait till the new year and just bring it back then. 
I told him I needed it fixed but he said it would be difficult to complete in a weeks time, I'm not sure why that matters but I said that's fine I will take it to the dealership near my house.

I asked if they could even do the Oil change and replace the run light that was out?
With an attitude he passed me off to the guy who handles the Oil Change.

Later I returned to pick up my car, and I opened the hood to look over the engine and check the oil dip stick.
I noticed the clip that holds my windshield wiper fluid in place was broken!

I went back in to ask the service guy to take a look and I was told he was in a meeting and I would need to wait 15 mins. So I walked back to the office where the meeting was being held, walked in and said excuse me there is a part broken on my car and I need him to come look at it. 

The Manager said who are you I responded with I am a customer and walked back to the car.

the manager and the sales guy along with 4 other guys followed me to the car and looked it over.
The Manager started to have a big Attitude! He tried to talk down to me and I butted in and said ""Sir knock off the Attitude, Right Now!""

The Manager did not even notice I said anything.

So I waited till he was done and said ""Whats with the Attitude?""

He just looked at me. So I repeated ""why do you have an attitude?""

He said ""I am going to look this part up"" and left.

He returned 5 mins later and started raising his voice again and I said STOP having an Attitude Right Now!
He paused and said I'm sorry, it has been a crazy morning, I have ordered the part and we will fix it. 

P.S. The light they fixed / replaced was very dim and after 1 day you can't even see the light is on unless you bend down to look at it and the message popped back up and says Run Light is out.

If I did not have to go back to have them fix the part they broke I would never go back to this Dealership. ",1,19,0,0

1365,937,30-Jan-19,"Last week I went in for an oil change. Asked if they could look at my alignment again because the last time they did it, I drove off and it was doing the same thing and the manager confirmed that it was still pulling to the right. (After test driving it while I was in the car.) I got my oil changed and then they said I should schedule to come in for the alignment issue. So they said they needed about 2 hrs since I had a wrangler and only have to work on the front wheels. We chose Wednesday. (He said Monday’s are busy). This morning I got there thinking it would take 2 hours I brought my computer and started working. Minutes later I was told that they didn’t want me to have to wait around and since this issue is covered under warranty they would give me a rental. I wasn’t happy with the rental (because it wasn’t a wrangler instead it was a mini Cherokee). I was then insured it would be finished by 3pm.  At 2 pm I got a phone call saying it wouldn’t be ready today. I asked what was wrong? They said they are backed up. Mind you I drive around town as part of my work duties. So then they said we should know something tomorrow by 10am. So I had to go back there to get my children’s car seats out and garage opener. i spoke with the manager when I got there to express my dissapointment that my car was not completed today as I had been told it would. His response was unacceptable (to me). He explained that they get backed up and I shouldn’t tie them to a tight time frame and I should expect to have to wait 2 days because they have 180ish cars to servive. (Mind you they told me how long it would take: 1st 2 hours, then by the end of the day). He went on to say that he had put my car in front of 25 other cars as if he was doing me a favor. Then reminded me that it had been a while since I first had had the alignment looked at. (Again as if it was my fault and I had already explained to them personal/medical reasons why it had taken so long for me to return. Not acknowledging the fact that I was told after it was worked on the first time that something wasn’t done right. When I came in last week I wasn’t expecting anything free but was told they would make it right).  I then asked him how is that good customer service. Then he blamed others for telling me a time frame. Never once apologized and accepted responsibility. I asked if I could keep my place in line and when they were working on the car in front of mines if I could bring my car back within 15 mins of the call. He went around this question by saying something that could take 2 hours might take 4. He said one of his techs stays until 6pm and May be able to look at it tonight but work wouldn’t be don’t till tomorrow. I also asked what was the purpose of scheduling an appointment if they wouldn’t even look at my car that day. He then asked why didn’t I leave my car there last week. I explained that I wasn’t given that portion and it would be better to schedule. (He has no response for that) The whole time we had this conversation he seemed irritated by the fact that I was holding them accountable. I understand things happen and at least the service provider was nice, respectable and showed empathy and was trying to find solutions for me. (I also understand that he is limited in what he can do to help me). The manager on the other hand was cold and blamed others including myself. On another note if the warranty company is paying for the rental while my car is being repaired, I’m not so sure that they would be happy to know that they paid for a loaner car, and the first day 8:30-4:30 (Probably wasn’t looked at, at all) my car wasn’t even looked at. So now I wait until tomorrow at 9:30am for them to call me and tell me what the problem is with my car. (I was also told it should be finished by 10am tomorrow).

1369,941,03-Jan-18,"Contacted several Jeep dealerships seeking a specific model of a Jeep renegade.  Was sent a email with a picture of the model I was looking for, so I called and set up an appointment.  Upon arriving I was not shown the Renegade that was shown in the email sent to me, but the sales person (Cary Murillo) listened to what I wanted and provided a similar model having the specifications I desired.  This is where things changed when it was learned that this was the Renegade I was interested in purchasing.   The process dragged out way too long taking almost 3 hours to purchase a Renegade for cash minus a trade in.  The trade in was a one owner vehicle with a clear title with no liens, had been excellently maintain by a dealership with all scheduled maintenance and was checked by that dealership just prior to this transaction.  The sales rep had to got to the manager to get the offer for the trade in and returned with a figure that was 1/3 of even a dealership trade in value.  When it was apparent that this figure was unacceptable and unrealistic to me, I was told that the manager ""didn't like the way the engine sounded""; but was also told the manager wasn't a mechanic.  The sales rep went back to the manager  and came back with an offer that was twice what was originally offered (this involved thousands of dollars).  It took less than 30 minutes to me to decide to buy the Renegade and most of the time spent waiting involved offers for the trade in.  If I had not already done my homework on the value of my trade in, I would have been out a lot of money to fatten the profit already being made upon me.  I have purchased many vehicles in my life and have faced this before as this is a well known ""car salesman"" tatic that people hate and fear.  Make extra money off the customer because they may not know what the trade-in value is and use some lame easy to back out of excuse for the first offer if the customer balks, and delay the whole process so the customer will get tired and agree to any offer just to get the whole process over with.  Good sales practice to increase profits, but has one bad side effect...You just showed the customer that you are trying to rip him off and makes the customer feel that he can't trust you to make a fair deal.  Makes the customer wonder what else in this deal are you pull and definitely brings out ""buyer beware"".  Definitely the trust is gone, and I didn't believe anything else said or excuses made to me after that.  The deal I finally agreed on still allowed the dealership to make a handsome profit on the trade-in as well as the sale, but it was what I expected. 
 I'm not against a dealership making a decent profit, but to try to rip the customer for more not only didn't get the more they wanted and lost the trust of the customer....doesn't sound like a good, long term business model to me.  Is it just in the sales department or does this tactic apply to their service department too by telling the customer he needs service that he really doesn't.  I won't find out as I will find another dealership for the service I need.  I will not purchased anything else from here and will tell all that I know to avoid this place that practices the old ""check with the manager game"".  I also hate the ""if you can't give us a 10 on reviews let us fix it"" game....you can't fix an attempt to rip the customer off.  Even if withdrawn, it still kills the trust.  I gave this review 2 stars not for the sales, but for large selection of vehicles in stock.   ",1,19,0,0

I am a frontline registered nurse and have been working everyday since March in NY and was only trying to purchase my daughter a birthday gift so I had 1 day off. I spent my entire day off going back and forth sending them all my information about a car I was trying to pay cash for. I paid a company to drive over to pick the car up once the paper work was done and sent to me. It took them 4 hours to figure out how to determine the taxes for alabama vs Texas. With my paperwork and everything sent over to me. I receive a text message from Orton this morning 6/2/20 that said the car was sold last night (while the store was closed I suppose)....Being that the last time I talked with him and received my paperwork was at 730pm.

I purchased 2 different vehicles from Ancira over the last couple of years with great results. I walked out both times feeling wonderful about the whole transaction. Yesterday after I left having being there to more than 7 1\2 hours, I felt like I'd been ran over by a truck! But when I got home and realized how I'd been treated like a fool and lied to i contacted the salesman who put me off to someone else and promised to call me the next morning. I did hear from two different men who could care less about the underhanded way I was treated. They will not let me return the car or try to make the deal right.

329,977,02-May-19,"It was my first service for my new car.  I never been in the service Dept before so I was very confused on the procedure on how to check in.  I pulled into their service floor and no one came outside after 10 minutes waiting in the service floor parking lot.   I decided to go inside to check in, all the technicians are sitting on chairs with a counter to separate them from the customers.  I told one tech, it was my first car service, and right away, I was ask with Who?  I told the technician who I was assigned to, and was redirected to that technician.   The technician I was redirected to, seems to be very frazzle with the workload he had over his counter on top of three more customers in from of me while the other technicians were joking and talking.   Why no one of his peers think of helping him, I don’t know.  But it was ver frustrating to be in there for 45 minutes before he can attend to me.  When he was able to talk with me, he informed me due to the problems my vehicle was experiencing that he was going to keep the vehicle for a day or two to find the cause, so I was giving a rental.  I thought that was a good compromise.   Anyway, my vehicle was dropped off on Monday morning, Tuesday not word on the status, Wednesday afternoon around 11 in the morning I decided to call asking for the status of my vehicle.   First time I phoned, The operator informed me, my technician was busy with another customer, and he would call me back.  15 minutes later, and he did.   He apologized for not able to take my call and gave me the status of my vehicle, told me that everyone went to lunch and I couldn’t get my vehicle yet, but that he would call me around 2:30 in the afternoon to let me know if I could.   Never happened.  So, by 4:00 in the afternoon, I decided to be more proactive and call.   Again, he was busy, and he will call me back.  15 minutes later, he was apologizing for not able to answering the phone and calling me back to let me know if I could pick up my car.   At this point he informed me I could.  I was excited but disappointed with the level of inefficiency within the company.  These are some of my personal suggestions to make that place on running much better.  Firstly, When you pulled in to the station for a service, some technician should be redirecting to you where you need to go or checking you in the spot with an iPad.  Using technology is beneficial on this circumstance.  If that is not possible a sign with instructions on the check in process.  

Secondly, technicians should be able to help anyone that come by the office if there are free. 

Thirdly, have a computer system where anyone can give you a level explanation on the status of your car, it would help the technicians improve overall experience with the customers on site without interruptions.   

There is more ideas I have but for the purpose of this review.  I think I am giving my most honest answer of my experience.  ",1,20,0,0

I had to go inside and get attitude right up front from the first service advisor who saw me. You can always tell when people don’t like doing their jobs and he was certainly one of them. It felt like I was bothering him just by the scowl on his face and the rude way he asked whether or not I have purchased the vehicle from the dealership, as though because I didn’t I was going to be  treated with less enthusiasm and friendliness. His next question rudely asked was do you have an appointment? When I answered no he rolled his eyes and figured oh great another one. This was just for a simple oil change by the way. Also he assumed that the jeep wave program I was a part of May not pay for the full oil change and then I’m I have to pay more.

This started from the time I called them with the snobby attitude on the phone, to the minute I walked into the service department and everyone was either ‘busy’ or just staring at their computer monitors.

1418,993,20-Jul-17,"In summary: Worst car buying experience we've ever had. I've never worked so hard to give someone my money. Do not shop here. Tell your friends not to shop here. Spend your money elsewhere and safe yourself a lot of misery. 

In detail: This was a good experience until we committed to purchasing a vehicle and signing our names on paper. At that point, we were handed off from one person to another (working with a total of 5 different people!), with poor communication between the employees and multiple mistakes made. There was no disclosure of the total price, financing options, or APR until we explicitly asked for it and, even then they were not forthcoming with the information. Additionally, our initial APR offer from them was over 5% until we informed them that we would be financing through another company. At that point their APR offer quickly dropped to less than 3%. We stuck with our other financing options. 

By TX law, the dealership has to register the vehicle for you. We wanted to register the vehicle in our home state and transfer my old plates, as we're only in TX temporarily. We were told that we couldn't do that. A quick call to our home state DMV confirmed that, yes, actually we could and suddenly the problem was solved. The dealership also held onto the registration paper work for 3 WEEKS after everything was official, further delaying the registration process. They had initially told us the paper work would be mailed off the same week we received the vehicle. This is unacceptable. When I called to check the status of the registration, Michelle, the Title Clerk,  rudely interrogated me as to why we chose to register our vehicle in a state other than TX (she did not approve of our decision).... obviously mailing a stack of 10 papers instead of 5 is too much of a hassle, even for someone who has just spent over $40,000 with your company. This is an example of pathetic laziness and extremely poor customer service. 

We have continuously had to call and go back to the dealership to follow up on paperwork (I went back 3 times after we signed everything) and they always come up with an excuse as to why the job isn't finished yet. What it comes down to in the end is they only want your money and are not concerned with maintaining appropriate business integrity, honest disclosure with their customers, or good customer service relationships.

But lately, the real problem has been in actually getting ahold of anyone to schedule a  service appointment. I left several messages for a callback to schedule my last appointment. All calls ALWAYS rolled to voicemail. Over a period of two weeks, and after several messages, I never got a call back so finally I drive down to the dealership to make an appointment in person!

1472,1053,03-Dec-18,"My brothers dodge caravan was towed in on October 28th because it had no power. Our service consultant was Charles. Communication between Charles and us was about as minimal as you can get. Unless we called him we could never get any information. The vehicle is a 2017 Dodge Caravan with a full bumper to bumper extended warranty mind you. On November 13th we were told that the warranty would not cover anything on the vehicle and we would need to pay the entire $5000+ service bill before we could take the van. When asked how this could be Charles told us ""because your warranty refused to cover the repairs"". I contacted the warranty company to inquire why this was. So on or about the 8th of November they (the warranty company) sent out an inspector who took pictures of everything but couldn't approve the needed repairs because the mileage couldn't be validated. They needed the van to power up to verify that we were within the mileage to approve.  So IPAC did the repair and the warranty company sent out a 2nd inspector to approve the completed repairs. When the 2nd inspector got there and he inspected the vehicle he could tell that the repairs that IPAC said they did, they didn't do. So they refused the repairs and that's when they tried to get us to pay for them. After almost another 2 weeks back and forth with IPAC and the warranty company come to find out IPAC never did the repairs they were trying to charge us and warranty company for. They told us that the service tech had lied to all of us about completed repairs. Today is December 3rd. we have been without a vehicle for over a month because they were dishonest.

If you want your vehicle to be well serviced and taken care of DO NOT take it to IPAC, in fact I would recommend you not buy any of their warranties to prevent their horrible service. The other day my cars engine randomly seized. I took it to the manufacturers dealership to get a full diagnostic and they found that our vehicle was 2 quarts OVER the recommended amount which they concluded caused the engine to fail. They could not find anything else wrong with the car besides that. We checked oil change records and IPAC had been adding way more then required for the last 2 or 3 oil changes. I've heard that their service department DOES NOT care for vehicles properly but gave them the benefit of the doubt... When you take your car in for service you expect the service to be made exactly what is required, nothing more nothing less and it's obvious that doesn't happen at IPAC. To make matters worse when we confronted them about the issue they told us that they MIGHT be able to cover a measly 20% of the damages but before that they had to escalate the situation to management. Two weeks pass by and I'm told employee that IPAC will not help with the repairs after all and that it was my fault because I should have checked to see that the service was properly done. I was also told that if I knew the car didn't require that much oil then I should have made a special request to get the correct oil amount and oil filter on my vehicle...I was never given the opportunity to speak to a customer relations person or a manager.

In December I had my car serviced due to every time it rained water would leak thru the roof leaving a stain and the smell of mildew. When I called it was my understanding it was under the manufacturer's warranty but was told they wouldn't work on it right away so I decided to bring it after the holidays. When I dropped off the vehicle it was suddenly over the manufacturers warranty and they made me pay out of pocket. Then when I picked up the vehicle I noticed a huge scratch on the door. I told the worker that scratch was not there and took a picture of it right in front of him. He tried to say it wasn't a scratch but if it was I could call and bring it back. Well I called and they told me to send an email to chernandez@ipacchrysler.com. Never got a single response. Called back again and was told to send an email to the head of the service department jwilde@ipacchrysler.com. After serval more emails still no response. I just want the scratch fixed.

Looks like I am just reiterating what everyone else has experienced at this dealership but here we go.
After inquiring (via ramtrucks.com) I was called by the dealership (Judy) and setup an appointment.  I drove an hour to make my appointment on time and on schedule showing the respect for their time that I expect to be shown for mine.  I was introduced to Judy (gatekeeper) and was quickly assigned to one of the hoard of salesmen that stared lustily at any potential victim who drove into the parking lot.  It was strikingly reminiscent of a combination of ""The Walking Dead"" and picking up day laborers in the HomeDepot parking lot.

I was then informed that the particular unit I had inquired about, being the only unit that met MOST of my requirements and all of my preferences, was unavailable as they were lifting it and putting oversized tires on it.  Since I am simple man who has come to terms with my stature, hairline, and masculinity I had no need of a lifted truck.  

I was at this point very incensed asked why I had been invited to drive an hour for no particular purpose.  The salesman assured me they had lots of units that would meet my needs even though he had no clue what those were.  He invited me to get into his vehicle and wander through their remote lot looking at random trucks.  I then recommended we complete a computer search of their stock with my particular requirements.  He was a confused by my idea of using tools to expedite the process and insisted we go wandering about in hopes of stumbling across something that might interest me.
At this point I was done with them and walked away.  I was glad I still had my keys and could make a speedy get away before the minions revolted and feasted upon brains.",1,22,0,0

1552,1143,08-Nov-19,On October 30th 2019 i Brought my car in to be serviced for the engine light that appeared on my dash. My Chrysler 300 2019 It’s only six months old so to my surprise the visit Indicated that my Calais converter was going out on my brand new car. I could not receive an appointment that day so they scheduled me forService when my parts came in. So November 1st parts come in and i take it back up there they do the work and i pick the car up. Get home the light comes back on. I call they say they don’t do service on the weekends and I’ll have to bring it back Monday. I bring it back on Monday and they informed me that they ordered and changed the wrong part and that they would have to order the correct part and try again and keep in mind i told them i was due at work in Pennsylvania on November 3rd. They informed me that the parts are going to take couple days to come in and that there’s nothing that they can do and I just have to be patient. Needless to say i lost my job position. Today is November 8th and i finally finish. On top of that the only way you find out any information about your Vehicle is the call because nobody calls nobody relays messages you have to keep calling calling calling calling so you can speak to someone because the service department does not call back and does not update you on your vehicle at all. Every time i was promised a time my car would be ready  when the time came they would change the time. This was a horrible experience and I’m very disappointed in gulfgate dodge ,1,23,0,0

I was informed by Johnathan that the tire could not be repaired and that I needed to buy a brand new tire that cost $170. I refused and asked for them to put the tire back on. I picked up my car with out any issues, so I thought. Fast forward to Wednesday 6/3, my tire started to lose pressure again and I took it to a tire shop. When they asked me for the key to the rims, I went in the glove compartment where the mechanic left it and there was no key in the container. I went to the dealership immediately and was told by Jonathan that I needed to come back Thursday morning so that the Manager can order new parts. I arrived this morning at 0830. About 20 minutes later. Johnathan gave me a new set and said that they match the ones I have on my car even after I asked him was he sure. I left and went straight to the tire shop and waited 2 hours for them to tell me the key didn’t match. I went back to the dealership very upset and crying hysterically when I was told I needed to leave my car and it would be a few hours. The only person that came to calm me down was a sales rep that actually sold me my car, Jaron. I received the rental at 1230 and I didn’t get my car back until 1630. I asked to speak with the manager and when I spoke with him he just looked at me as if I was speaking a different language. I expressed to him everything that happened and that this was the worse customer service I have ever experienced. He just nodded his head and said ok without an apology. My parents referred me to the dealership and I referred my niece but I will no longer do business or refer anyone else to the dealership. This was a big inconvenience and very time consuming.

1601,1195,15-May-19," I had to drop off my truck for an oil leak diagnosis. It was apparently found but took about a week to fix. I was called to pick it up. Then immediately called again to cancel my pickup. Leak sprung again. Redo. Days later, called to pickup. I picked up my truck, leak sprung a few days later, while I was away for work. Brought it back as soon as I could. Again, leak diagnosed and took about a week to fix. I picked it up and the leak sprung again the next day. I hesitated to bring it back but my advisor Gary convinced me to. Gary was very professional and much help before, so I agreed. This time, he brought in a specialist to diagnose it. They found the real leak. I supposed it was in a harder-to-reach area than the tech would’ve liked to check. Due to it being in that area, I was told it would at least take ten days. Things had to be taken out and whatnot. When I finally picked it up, I checked the summary and inspected my truck as I always do. Things usually line up. This time they did not. The summary stated a 13 mile road test had been done. But 80 miles were put on the odometer, half a tank of fuel had been burned, and the took of my black truck had white paint rubbed on top. Only caused by running through a clearance that is too low. Joyride or whatever you wanna call it. I went back inside before driving at all and confronted the service advisor staff, including the manager at the last desk. They agreed that i was right about what it looked like. Unfortunately, they shrugged it off as an “oh well, xxxx happens” moment. Said nothing could be done for me since neither Gary, the diesel tech, nor the reimbursement guy were there. And that I could go back the next day if I wanted to be reimbursed for the fuel. I told them that I didn’t care about the $30 fuel reimbursement and that I wondered if that there were anything that could be done to convince me to keep my service here, if they cared about it. Once again I was met with blank stares. I’ve got a 2017 Cummins and a 2014 Charger and I would buy all my parts here and get any service I couldn’t do myself here.

  Conveniently he can't find form. He wrote on form about radio after plates come in 6 myths free.  Oil change free.  Etc.

1603,1197,08-May-19,I purchased a challenger I thought was the Hemi alll along that Stressfully asked over and over its the hemi its the hemi and they said yes. That’s one. Then I just a few days ago I went to get my tires checked because the tires in the back rammed out from the inner part of the tires and all they did was rotated only. Now my car goes side ways and unbalanced. ,1,23,0,0
1604,1198,30-Apr-19,So I got a service with tire rotation done. A day later my tire sensor went out so I called to schedule an appointment.  I went in a week later on a scheduled day. They wanted me to leave my vehicle just to troubleshoot the sensor as if anyone has the luxury of just leaving a vehicle.  After an hour and a half of walking around outside i went in and tried to get an update from Steve. That arrogant jerk ignored me and acted as if i was not in front of him taking a call just pushing me off. But as soon as a young woman walked in the door he was quick to hang up and try to bend over backwards for her. So i asked that someone else help. Got the update from Luis. He came back and said the tech cleared the code and drove my truck 3 miles to see if the sensor would reset. I was worried because I have the progressive snapshot plugged in so I checked it. The logged report said the vehicle was on for about 2 minutes and that was when they moved it to the back. I asked how did they drive it if it was only on 2 minutes and I was outside the whole time never saw the truck leave. They could not answer. They said they fixed the sensor and let me go. A day later the fault code came back on and now they wont return my call so I can schedule another service. I will not recommend gulfgate dodge for any service other than a basic oil change. And not even for that. ,1,23,0,0

1609,1204,26-Mar-19,"I purchased my previous vehicle (2015 Chrysler 200) from her in 2015 and my salesperson at that time was Tyrone (he is so awesome).  I knew I was in need of another car (high mileage) and Juana called me about a special deal that was going on at the dealership so I decided to go in.

Juana was very patient, kind, empathic, and was listened to my every need.  I advised her of my budget and she worked hard at trying to get me the deal that I wanted; however she wasn’t successful.  She asked if I could meet with one of her managers about making a deal for me that I would be willing to compromise with and I agreed.

One of the managers, Alexis, approached me and advised me of two options that I had.  After I explained to him that neither option would work, he offered some unethical suggestions (i.e. stop paying on my current vehicle and just make payments on the new car) for me to consider so that he could make the deal.  He also stated that it really wouldn’t matter if I stop making payments on my car because my credit wasn’t the best (my credit is fair).  When I refused to follow suite, he returned back to his office to see if there were other options for me to consider.  At this point, I was irritated, frustrated, and overall disrespected at the horrible customer service I received from someone who is a manager.  I asked Juana for my keys and my id because I was ready to go and she obliged my request.

She walked me to my car and I advised Juana that it wasn’t her that I had an issue with, it was Alexis and the way he treated me (I did use a few choice words about my feelings and experience with the manager).  I explained to her that I didn’t like how he spoke to me, how he approached me with the deal, and how he attempted to belittle me about the decision that I was making towards the deal.  I told her that I did have a positive outlook on this place; however it has changed with me working with him.  She acknowledged my feelings and respected my decision.

Once I was getting ready to leave, another sales person approved me, Armando, who overheard some of the conversation that I had with Juana.  I explained to him the interaction that I had with Alexis and how I refused to be treated like that from someone who wants my business and that it was best for me to leave.  He acknowledged my feelings as well and provided his professional opinion about the deal. 

After leaving the dealership and evaluating my decision, I contacted Juana and was able to make a compromise (where I didn’t have to deal with Alexis) regarding the sale of the vehicle.  I was able to make my purchase and not interact with that manager in the process.  I was able to leave the dealership with what I wanted, which worked out at the end.

If it wasn’t for Tyrone, Juana, Armando, and Ms. Denise (in finance), I wouldn’t recommend this dealership nor would I have purchased my car from here again.  My suggestion would be to offer Alexis to attend customer service training, respect customers’ decisions, morals, and ethical beliefs, don’t approach deals with unethical recommendations, and be cognitive of the words that are being used when he is communicating with customers.

1619,1214,04-Feb-19,"My friend and I went in to Gulfgate a few weeks ago to look at a preowned vehicle. I had called ahead to tell them what we saw online and to have the vehicle ready for us to look at and they gave us the name of a salesman to speak with when we arrived. We arrived at the dealership and the salesman was busy so we were then told to speak with Anwar, who never actually introduced himself as I had to ask for his name after we left. We looked at the car and automatically didn’t like it because it was a smokers vehicle and then looked at another and test drove it. As we got into the car to test drive, the manager saw us in the vehicle with the salesman and said, “This looks like a crime waiting to happen. A white man, a black man, and two asian girls.” I could not believe that racist remark came out of the manager’s mouth but we just ignored it at the time.  The vehicle we test drove was an Infiniti and the salesman knew nothing about the vehicle but the obvious features. We brought up seat warmers and he didn’t even know if the car had them and brushed it off like nothing. We got back from the test drive and talked about the car and ultimately decided it was not the perfect car so we weren’t going to try and buy the vehicle and when we said we didn’t like something about the car, the salesman was very rude with his responses. I did not like the fact that the vehicle was a rental and had many drivers in and out of the vehicle and the salesman gave us strong attitude when I said that and said, “Well what are you expecting with a used car?” Then the disrespectful salesman thanked us for wasting his time and then asked if we would talk to his manager so he “wouldn’t get in trouble”. We went and talked to the racist manager who was slightly nicer, although he questioned our opinions on the vehicle and that was very disrespectful and uncouth as that just made the situation worse. When we specifically told the manager we wanted seat warmers, he said, “Really? Seat warmers in Texas?” Ironically is was 40 degrees that morning. So then we left and went on our two hour journey home as we came from out of town. The next day my friend realized she couldn’t find her license and wondered if the salesman had given it back we he made a copy for the test drive. Well I call and turns out he left the license in the copy machine so we asked if they would mail it back as we live two hours out of town. They said they would and almost two weeks later she still hadn’t received her license. So I call again a week later after them not answering the phone once and they said they still have the license and will send it out soon. Well she finally got it one and a half weeks later after that phone call with no sort of explanation or apology.

Jaron explained the warranty that was added to the car, he also mentioned it was a way for the dealership to recoup some of the labor cost for prepping the vehicle.  After I told him I was not going to pay more than the advertised price, he got his manager.  His manager confirmed that he would not sell the car for less than the elevated warranty price.

After the director's departure, I continued discussions with Jaron, I expressed my displeasure of the bait and switch tactic.  Jaron began to tell me I was a bad consumer because if I didn't pay the elevated price I was preventing him from supporting his daughter.  This was the absolute worst sales tactic I have ever seen.

At this point I walked out of the Used Car building and went straight to NEw Car building asking for the GM.

Searching through Cargurus it directed me to this Website GulfGateDodge for a Nissan Altima 2017 with 11000 Miles for a price of $12995. I saw there was no accident reported. I called the dealer on 29th Sep and the person who picked up the call asked for the Stock Number.829339A. She confirmed , yes the vehcile is available but as the Dealership is Closed on Saturdays , I can only look at the car the next day Sunday. She asked me what time I intend to come. I said around 11.30am on 30 Sep. She said ""Joe"" would be my Contact person. On Sunday the dealership called around 11.30 to check if I am going to visit or not. I said Sorry I am late but I would be there around 12.30-12.45pm. She confirmed sounds good , and my contact person now would be ""Xavian"". I reach the dealership and searched for Xavian where he said he is busy with a Customer and someone else would assist me. I waited for around 10 mins and was greeted by an extremely fine person Mr.Raul. I had to explain and give the stock number specifically which I have come for. He was unable to find the stock and said in that case the car might be in workshop. I was a bit surprised a car which was in Stock for Sale for 43 days is in workshop. I requested him to verify. After 10 mins he came back with a ""Sorry message that the car is Sold the previous day."" I was amazed. I said but your dealership is Closed on Saturdays. Then he said the Sales Person sold the car on Friday and did the Delivery on Saturday. I was Extremely Disappointed with the False Information and sheer headache of travelling 20miles to hear this crap. I said can I meet the Manager. I went with him and the Manager said he will come in sometime. I waited more than 15 mins. Then another person Jimmy informed the Manager again. After 10 mins I was asked to go to his desk. There the fun starts. I told him the list of events and I was shocked to hear his response. Here I quote George Nabbout "" We do not update the inventory so frequently in the Website/Internet. Moreover these inventory may may not be there but once the Customer is here then we try to sell whatever inventory we have. These Internet Inventory & Pricing is to Attract Customers"". I asked why dont you put ""Pending Sale"" , he said since our inventory is too low it does not make to update every minute by minute Inventory status . For him it meant its fine to give incorrect information to Customers as they are to attract Customers. I was Super Upset. I was thinking what crap dealership , what is the difference between roadside Dealerships and these big branded ones. Then I thought to come back to get his name for Review. When I came , obviously I was frustrated , I said "" Your names please"" , he said ""george"" , can you please give me the full name. Then he gave me his Business Card. Then I was leaving & he called ""excuse me"" and said in extremely rude manner "" why are you giving me such a ""f*** o**"" look & some more derogatory words"" I said back. I don't think I ever said those words nor my action prompted those behavior, I requested you to speak outside so that there is no scene amongst your customers & subordinates just in case you are a Manager."" His words"" I have nothing to hide , I have 4 College Degress, and from your appearance it seems you are also educated college degrees & .....( that I have means & resources). I dont know how many years you are in this country but I am here for 30 years & lot of jibber jabber.."" . I said again ""I have not done anything derogatory nor shouted nor raised my voice unlike you are ,  yes I am very upset and angry and I feel cheated because of wrong information which for you was super casual as it is your part of normal business cycle"". Then he said ""Yes that specific deal was a steal , i know $13000, 11k miles Altima , anybody will grab for it. I dont think you will die if you dont get that car today. I am sure this probably is going to be 2nd or 3rd car just because its a steal deal. If you want I can call you once we have such cars and miles & you can come."" I actually was super upset with his way of behaviour , I left my name and number. But inside I was sure never to visit this dealership ever.  And the best part , all time he was sitting in his chair , there was not even a chair for the Customer . Hence I was standing & he was blabbering sitting. Being in a Customer Service industry I really feel pity for him. He is really lucky to have a very good Manager else by now I would have fired him , a very can be very good at his target n numbers but a person with wrong attitude can spoil the name & create a bad atmosphere for other team members & the organization Goals.. I feel extremely sad for this Organization & Leaders .. My advice , DO NOT visit the dealership directly if you have some stock seen over the internet. Speak with a Sales Person & verify if the stock # & price is there. I saw some Google Reviews where few have complained that , they even has bumped up the price & did not honor website pricing. There seems to be an integrity issue with this dealership , hence visit at your own risk & luck. This happened specific to ""Pre Owned Car"" Division.",1,23,0,0

1642,1241,19-Sep-18,"In late May, another dealership (Bayway Dodge) replaced a computer part. They told me they replaced the TIPM. They actually replaced the PCM, but more on that later. Immediately after the repair, my car started acting horribly. After a bad experience at Bayway, I took my car to Gulfgate.

I let them know that Bayway replaced a computer part, and the part was most likely bad because the problem started happening immediately after the part was replaced. Instead of immediately checking the service history on my car to verify what I told them, they took 2 months to verify. They saw that the PCM was replaced, not the TIPM. This is a fact that could have been cleared up on Day 1 with proper communication. 
My car spent over 2 months at the dealership. When I would call, they would promise to give me a call back in 30 minutes, that afternoon, etc. Often it would take several days or over a week to get a call back.

do your homework before coming here. do not pay for ""accessories"" and get your own financing if possible.

Found a white a 2017 Limited but they didn’t have it (although site said they had 6). Asked to price a JGC High Altitude. We submitted info to look at numbers. Sales Manager Mike Chapa came and gave us initial numbers with rates possibly less than 5%. At one point we mentioned just looking at numbers and weren’t thinking of buying...Mike immediately pushed his chair back and was about to stand up to leave when I stopped him and said we were discussing numbers. Obviously our time was not worth his. At that moment I advised them that the info on the sheet was not correct as we were interested in the white JGC and not the red JGC. Mike pulled up the correct information and notated all the rebates and said no worries its about the same so it’s fine. We had asked for a lower rate so he went back again. When he came back we again discussed rates but also advised him that we could get a better rate with our bank. He said ok and that he would re-verify rebates. He left again. At this time Chris (who has been more than awesome throughout this whole thing) comes and tells us Mike had agreed to the price and since our bank was closed they would let us sign the paper with the agreed amount, take the vehicle and then come back during the week to finalize the transaction. Chris advised that the $1k rebate for Mother’s Day had not been added and I also advised that I didn’t feel comfortable signing without the correct vehicle information being listed. He went back to have everything corrected only to have Mike come back and tell us the price was now $3k more because they realized there was a difference. My husband told him we had identified from the beginning which vehicle we were looking at and that he stated it was about the same but he stated he never said such a thing.

The absolute WORST place to purchase a vehicle. The staff doesn't communicate, managers don't return calls and don't take your concerns seriously, oh and how could I forget DON'T APPRECIATE YOUR BUSINESS. 

Andrew Cordova, GM? Hm, you couldn't get the GM to answer the phone even if your life depended on it.

The Finance guy in Used Cars, Ryan? I don't know which habit it worst, lying or not returning people's calls.

Our Salesman Mike? How could I forget! He forgot us after we purchased our used vehicle. Dodging calls after making excuse after excuse. 

Christian in Used Sales? Pathetic Car Salesman who is dumbfounded at any and all questions.

My husband and I walked into that dealership with a trade in and put our application in with Ryan to drive out with a 17' Dually and a 15' Charger. Well, turns out all we got was the xxxxing run around. We were told approval for both of the vehicles THEN we were told only the charger but that he could FOR SURE get us into the SLT 2500 buuuut the next day told us that we couldn't get into it despite his promise SO he told us we could get into a car as long as it was under $35000 SO we pick a 17' Jeep for 31,9 and even with a co-signer this guy promised he could get me in it and even let me drive it off the lot. 4 days later (mind you, they never called us to update us) we call and call to get a hold of someone and when we do (Christian) he informed us that we were approved and in the single digits. GREAT RIGHT!? No. We called later on the way up there and he informed us that he was misinformed and I wasn't approved. I was pissed. After sitting in that lobby for 5 hours Thursday, which have Salesman running around cussing and not acting professional while I have my toddler with me I was ready to be done. I am waiting for a gift card currently that we were advertised and promise up until signing when everyone decided to not even return our calls, not like they did in the first place. I have been waiting for about 3 weeks now. It is advertised and promised at signing but yet no one will acknowledge our xxxxty customer service, unbeknownst to them, right? Wrong. My husband has reached out to Mr. Cordova and let me tell you that this man can't return a call if your life depended on it. 

The dealership is flawed to say the least but the real crack in the foundation comes down to the staff. 

Don't waste your time. Don't waste the trip because all you'll get is disappointment and empty promises from incompetent Salesman just making a buck.

I purchased a 2017 Chevrolet equinox  07/06/2017 and the advertised sale price online was $19,800. When I got home, I realized the sale price on the contract said $22,800 which is $3000 above the Internet price. The next day I called the dealership and let them know why was the sale price change from $19,800 to $22,800 and they stated because there was a mandatory warranty that I had to purchase. I advised them that I didn't want that warranty and they told me it was mandatory or else they weren't going to be able to honor the Internet price. I let them know that they can't force me to purchase a warranty or service contract if I don't want to and they simply stated that it was too late I already agreed and signed the contract. I know it was my fault for not verifying the numbers on the contract but this dealership operates with deceptive practices in order to increase their profits and they hide everything from you and just make you sign really quick. By law warranties are free and service contract should be charged as a separate line item on the contract instead of increasing the sale price of the vehicle.

I went in to get an Oil Change, replace a run light and get a recall done on my car at Huffines Lewisville near my work.

Was told they didn't want to take the time to do the paperwork and get me a rental car for the Recall on my car. They said can you wait till the new year and just bring it back then. 
I told him I needed it fixed but he said it would be difficult to complete in a weeks time, I'm not sure why that matters but I said that's fine I will take it to the dealership near my house.

I asked if they could even do the Oil change and replace the run light that was out?
With an attitude he passed me off to the guy who handles the Oil Change.

Later I returned to pick up my car, and I opened the hood to look over the engine and check the oil dip stick.
I noticed the clip that holds my windshield wiper fluid in place was broken!

I went back in to ask the service guy to take a look and I was told he was in a meeting and I would need to wait 15 mins. So I walked back to the office where the meeting was being held, walked in and said excuse me there is a part broken on my car and I need him to come look at it. 

The Manager said who are you I responded with I am a customer and walked back to the car.

the manager and the sales guy along with 4 other guys followed me to the car and looked it over.
The Manager started to have a big Attitude! He tried to talk down to me and I butted in and said ""Sir knock off the Attitude, Right Now!""

The Manager did not even notice I said anything.

So I waited till he was done and said ""Whats with the Attitude?""

He just looked at me. So I repeated ""why do you have an attitude?""

He said ""I am going to look this part up"" and left.

He returned 5 mins later and started raising his voice again and I said STOP having an Attitude Right Now!
He paused and said I'm sorry, it has been a crazy morning, I have ordered the part and we will fix it. 

P.S. The light they fixed / replaced was very dim and after 1 day you can't even see the light is on unless you bend down to look at it and the message popped back up and says Run Light is out.

To make it worse, they calculated the deal including it, then had to try to work around why the payment was going to be higher than I had been told.  Then I found I needed to buy high-priced window tint and running boards.  Basically I ended up paying about MSRP when I had come looking for a reasonable discount.

I called another dealer just to check as I thought this was unreasonable. I made a reservation for the next Monday at the other dealer took it in and it was repaired by Tuesday at 11am..

1728,1337,30-Jan-19,"Last week I went in for an oil change. Asked if they could look at my alignment again because the last time they did it, I drove off and it was doing the same thing and the manager confirmed that it was still pulling to the right. (After test driving it while I was in the car.) I got my oil changed and then they said I should schedule to come in for the alignment issue. So they said they needed about 2 hrs since I had a wrangler and only have to work on the front wheels. We chose Wednesday. (He said Monday’s are busy). This morning I got there thinking it would take 2 hours I brought my computer and started working. Minutes later I was told that they didn’t want me to have to wait around and since this issue is covered under warranty they would give me a rental. I wasn’t happy with the rental (because it wasn’t a wrangler instead it was a mini Cherokee). I was then insured it would be finished by 3pm.  At 2 pm I got a phone call saying it wouldn’t be ready today. I asked what was wrong? They said they are backed up. Mind you I drive around town as part of my work duties. So then they said we should know something tomorrow by 10am. So I had to go back there to get my children’s car seats out and garage opener. i spoke with the manager when I got there to express my dissapointment that my car was not completed today as I had been told it would. His response was unacceptable (to me). He explained that they get backed up and I shouldn’t tie them to a tight time frame and I should expect to have to wait 2 days because they have 180ish cars to servive. (Mind you they told me how long it would take: 1st 2 hours, then by the end of the day). He went on to say that he had put my car in front of 25 other cars as if he was doing me a favor. Then reminded me that it had been a while since I first had had the alignment looked at. (Again as if it was my fault and I had already explained to them personal/medical reasons why it had taken so long for me to return. Not acknowledging the fact that I was told after it was worked on the first time that something wasn’t done right. When I came in last week I wasn’t expecting anything free but was told they would make it right).  I then asked him how is that good customer service. Then he blamed others for telling me a time frame. Never once apologized and accepted responsibility. I asked if I could keep my place in line and when they were working on the car in front of mines if I could bring my car back within 15 mins of the call. He went around this question by saying something that could take 2 hours might take 4. He said one of his techs stays until 6pm and May be able to look at it tonight but work wouldn’t be don’t till tomorrow. I also asked what was the purpose of scheduling an appointment if they wouldn’t even look at my car that day. He then asked why didn’t I leave my car there last week. I explained that I wasn’t given that portion and it would be better to schedule. (He has no response for that) The whole time we had this conversation he seemed irritated by the fact that I was holding them accountable. I understand things happen and at least the service provider was nice, respectable and showed empathy and was trying to find solutions for me. (I also understand that he is limited in what he can do to help me). The manager on the other hand was cold and blamed others including myself. On another note if the warranty company is paying for the rental while my car is being repaired, I’m not so sure that they would be happy to know that they paid for a loaner car, and the first day 8:30-4:30 (Probably wasn’t looked at, at all) my car wasn’t even looked at. So now I wait until tomorrow at 9:30am for them to call me and tell me what the problem is with my car. (I was also told it should be finished by 10am tomorrow). I feel like I would have been better off staying there to wait, maybe they would have at least looked at it. ",1,24,0,0

I was working with Surya and we got financing all setup (I subsequently went with my credit union but not really the point of this review).  So they did not have it on the lot, the vehicle I wanted.  Surya said they could get it.  Well they located one really quickly but it was a demo with 2500 miles on it.  I said I didnt want a demo so we went to another truck.  Another truck came up and the dealer trade just couldnt be made but this was after Surya told me it was secured.   Then a 3rd vehicle came up.  The trade was done yet the day I was supposed to go in and sign it was told me to that this was a demo.  The salesperson took no blame for this is issue at all.  He said repeatedly it was not his fault and do not kill the messenger.  It was a comedy of errors of not setting expectations properly and not taking ownership for mistakes.

1732,1341,03-Jan-18,"Contacted several Jeep dealerships seeking a specific model of a Jeep renegade.  Was sent a email with a picture of the model I was looking for, so I called and set up an appointment.  Upon arriving I was not shown the Renegade that was shown in the email sent to me, but the sales person (Cary Murillo) listened to what I wanted and provided a similar model having the specifications I desired.  This is where things changed when it was learned that this was the Renegade I was interested in purchasing.   The process dragged out way too long taking almost 3 hours to purchase a Renegade for cash minus a trade in.  The trade in was a one owner vehicle with a clear title with no liens, had been excellently maintain by a dealership with all scheduled maintenance and was checked by that dealership just prior to this transaction.  The sales rep had to got to the manager to get the offer for the trade in and returned with a figure that was 1/3 of even a dealership trade in value.  When it was apparent that this figure was unacceptable and unrealistic to me, I was told that the manager ""didn't like the way the engine sounded""; but was also told the manager wasn't a mechanic.  The sales rep went back to the manager  and came back with an offer that was twice what was originally offered (this involved thousands of dollars).  It took less than 30 minutes to me to decide to buy the Renegade and most of the time spent waiting involved offers for the trade in.  If I had not already done my homework on the value of my trade in, I would have been out a lot of money to fatten the profit already being made upon me.  I have purchased many vehicles in my life and have faced this before as this is a well known ""car salesman"" tatic that people hate and fear.  Make extra money off the customer because they may not know what the trade-in value is and use some lame easy to back out of excuse for the first offer if the customer balks, and delay the whole process so the customer will get tired and agree to any offer just to get the whole process over with.  Good sales practice to increase profits, but has one bad side effect...You just showed the customer that you are trying to rip him off and makes the customer feel that he can't trust you to make a fair deal.  Makes the customer wonder what else in this deal are you pull and definitely brings out ""buyer beware"".  Definitely the trust is gone, and I didn't believe anything else said or excuses made to me after that.  The deal I finally agreed on still allowed the dealership to make a handsome profit on the trade-in as well as the sale, but it was what I expected. 
 I'm not against a dealership making a decent profit, but to try to rip the customer for more not only didn't get the more they wanted and lost the trust of the customer....doesn't sound like a good, long term business model to me.  Is it just in the sales department or does this tactic apply to their service department too by telling the customer he needs service that he really doesn't.  I won't find out as I will find another dealership for the service I need.  I will not purchased anything else from here and will tell all that I know to avoid this place that practices the old ""check with the manager game"".  I also hate the ""if you can't give us a 10 on reviews let us fix it"" game....you can't fix an attempt to rip the customer off.  Even if withdrawn, it still kills the trust.

88,1366,24-Jan-20,"The sale went fine, but then I had a problem that they did not resolve.  The driver's side front time would not hold air.  I kept airing it up and it kept loosing air.  I live 70 miles from Lithia so I took it to the Dodge house near me.  First off, the car did not have the lug key.  In order to check the tire, they had to take the tire off.  Not possible without the key.  So I called Lithia and told them my problem.  I spoke to one of the 2 salesmen (Tyler) who had made my sale.  I was told the car sold ""as is"" and he was very sorry, but could not help.  So I paid the dealer near me $65 to break off the lugs.  They discovered that the tire had been patched and air was leaking around the patch, and that I would need a new tire.... to the tune of $270.  I called Lithia and spoke to a manager (Michael) and explained my problem.  He too said, the car sold ""as is"" and ""sorry"" they could not help me.  My total bill was $437.45.  Lithia ""certified"" the car before I drove it off the lot.  Doesn't that mean they checked it out?  Doesn't it mean they should have at least noticed that I did not have a lug key?  I even think they should have discovered that the tire could not hold air.  The car I bought was a 2018 Dodge Charger with 19,900 miles on it.  I am very UN happy with customer service.  They wanted me happy before I signed the papers, but they don't really care about me now that the deal is done.  Besides this:  They got me in the door because they promised that they had located the very car I was searching for online.  When they contacted us, they said it was someplace in another town, but couldn't tell me where it was.  Then when I drove to Lithia, they said, ""oh, it just sold"", and offered me what they had on their lot.  Why did I fall for that???

I have always received GREAT service until the last year or so. Getting my oil changed has become a pain and no one every returns a phone call.

Well, on May 16 I was driving and my van wouldn't accelerate at a green light but the engine was reeving - figured something was wrong with my transmission. Got the van to a parking lot on the A&M campus and call Chrysler's Roadside assistance. They sent a tow truck. While I was waiting received a rude call from the service advisor because he had to open a ticket since he was notified my from Chrysler my van was coming.  That was at around 1pm. At around 2pm the tow truck came for the van.

I waited most of the day on Thursday, May 17 to hear that they had my van and what was up. At 3pm I caved and called. I was told they would have my service advisor call me.

Friday, May 17, I called at 10am to find out if they had my van and again was told that they would ask my service advisor to call me . I called back at 3:30 because I needed to know if my van actually got to the service center or not. The service witch board staff member hunted someone down who confirmed my van was there and said they would put in a notice to have my service advisor call me back.

On Monday, May 21st I called at 10am to see if someone could tell me something. I in no means was expecting my car to be fixed in less than a week but some information, communication would have been nice. Again told they would ping my service advisor to call me.

I then get original salesman texting me telling me they'd take $8600 even though they weren't making anything on it. So what happened to ""that's the lowest they would take"". He tells me GM was upset that salesman ""let me leave"" so they were offering me this low price just to keep my business. This is the reason I don't like buying used cars from a dealership. I told salesman I wanted their price upfront and I didn't want all the back and forth games. I guess he didn't hear that. If they  would have called and said ""$8,000 out the door"" I'd probably be driving it today. ",1,25,0,0

After the sale I discovered that the STX versions didn't have the trailer brake fuse installed for some reason. I had to make the service department aware of the issue. I was not contacted about the permanent license plates. I had to call and find out how to get them. Which was for me to drive there and retrieve them./ No offer to mount them. And now the bills for toll road use since they didn't remove the plate from my trade in and used the car. They won't see any more business from me.,1,26,0,0

That has now changed because my battery was bad and was told by Ford service adviser that it would take two or 3 days to change my battery out. This is my work truck and that is really pathetic it should take so long. The reason given was because they were so busy and a lot of people in front of me.

I had a young mechanic test out the entire fuel system and in a mater of 30 minutes he found the problem. Your service man Mr. Tom Williams, stated he had 30 years repairing Lincoln's I truly sought it. The dealer also recomended I purchase a computer from Computer exchange.com that it would be all set just to plug and run. Not so, the computer took 7 days to arrive and did not work as stated, the was $ 220.00 down the drain. Used the original computer which they claimed was bad.

I asked the salesperson Josh, to get it fixed again, he said he would ask it they could and never got back with me. I texted a few times, and even went up there and asked about it. He said, ""let me find out"".. I heard nothing... it has now been 6 months and the issue has not been fixed and needs to be ASAP

2. There is a foggy spot between the glass panes on the passenger side windshield.. they are refusing to fix it as ""they do not handle glass issues""

I have created an appointment to get my oil changed with vale service, however every time I do they either say it will take several hours or cannot pick the care up via the valet service because they got slammed.

After talking for 15 minutes to a salesman, he brought in someone else. I started over. Then, they came to me after being gone for 20 minutes and said the car was unavailable and in servicing and not ready to put back out on the lot until next Tuesday. We couldn't look at it because of paint fumes from spray painting the bumper.

When Travis came back, he said he was sorry and we had to start over with a salesman named Trent. He said the other car was not available. The day before, Eddie told us to make the 1 and half hour drive to the dealership and the car was ready to take home with us if all went well. Lie.

Now, Trent said he had another car that matched our requirements and drove it around to the front. It was a 2008 instead of the 2015 Fiesta advertised and had a sticker price of $2,500 more.

Then, I said I would like to buy the one in service and he brought out a paper for me to agree to for a 2013 Ford Fiesta with a list price of $12,000 and a sales price of $10,000. By now this was getting old how I was being treated.

In conclusion, I was told by Eddie of Maxwell the car was available and a deal could be worked out and we just needed to drive 1 and half hour and meet him at 10:30. He failed to meet with us and gave Travis to us not saying the car was not available.

I suggest anyone reading this review be very cautious when responding to an advertisement that is so good it gets your attention.  Oh, and yes, when Eddie told us later that it was a stick shift and not an automatic he said someone else does the internet and it was probably a typo.

I called four times over the next 4 days.  On Friday, I was told that my truck was still waiting, up it was the 'next one to go into the shop'...  I heard this same excuse on the previous days, every time I called, the truck was the 'next one to go in'.  Apparently there only one mechanic that can review a possible oil leak.  I told them to pull my truck out of line, I will take it Leif Johnson.  The Server person hung up on me...  Quite the professional attitude for calming irate customers.  Just hang up the phone.  It was almost as good as the girl that answered the phone, told me my truck was 'next in line to go into the shop' for review.  She just passed the phone on to someone else to listen to my complaint.  On Monday, Frankie, a new service rep called and told me that if I wanted, the one and only mechanic was ready to look at my truck.  
This was truck # 5 from Maxwell Ford, the first Factory warranty work on any of the trucks and it will be my last business with Maxwell Ford.  I'll find another dealership for future service work and new vehicles.  I don't really blame the service reps, I think that management process sets them up for failure. But I don't need to put up with the complete lack of customer service and professionalism that.  ",1,27,0,0

1851,1478,31-Dec-18,"What a ridiculous experience I've had with Maxwell Ford.  Two interactions in six months, and both were less than stellar.  In summary: 
1) No ability/willingness to give customers a reasonable-for-the-work being performed waiting period 
2) Poor understanding of service contracts - first response is ""it's not covered"".  Make sure you know your rights.
3) Generally poor customer service.  
4) ADVICE:  Be a good advocate for yourself, particularly if you are female.
The whole tale follows:
The first - an oil change - necessitated a three hour wait for a booked service ""because we like to get everyone in at the same time"".  I have a service maintenance plan, which I asked to use for a piece of door trim (I was just out of the warranty period).  According to the service technician the loose trim would require a new door, which wasn't covered by the contract.  I accepted him at his word, and castigated myself for leaving it until after the warranty had lapsed.  It was only a piece of trim so I bought some super glue to fix it.  I then checked the contract which says that something is covered as long as it's not specifically excluded.  Surprise, surprise, the door wasn't excluded.  I chalked it up to experience.
My latest run-in happened when I invoked the wheel-and-tire coverage I purchased in addition to my service contract.  I damaged two tires and wheels falling into a pot hole, and needed to have them replaced.  I took the damaged parts down to Maxwell (again, a scheduled service), and my technician's first response was ""they're not covered"".  Anticipating idiocy, I had familiarized myself with the contract, which covers ""road hazards, and specifically puts pot holes in that category (unlike road works, which are specifically excluded).  I pointed out the appropriate clause.  Technician seemed surprised ""I didn't know it covered pot hole"" (makes me wonder how many people have been cheated out of replacements).  The tires and wheels were replaced after two trips (i.e. two separate three hour waits), and I thought I was done.  Apparently not; I barely reached home when John, the technician, called to say he needed the DOT numbers from the tires for their records.  I gave him same.  All done?  No, I received another call about a week later to say I needed to come in (a 20 mile drive) so that he could look at the numbers as ""I have him the wrong ones"".  I declined to make that wasted journey, and suggested I send a picture of the tires.  The pictures I showed the same DOT numbers I had given John a week earlier.",1,27,0,0
94,1479,24-Dec-18,"I made a call this morning to the service department requesting an upgrade to my Sync/MyFord Touch system. 

The customer support tech I had spoken to at Maxwell Ford was short, quick, and rude with an abrupt answer of ""no that's not possible"". I informed him that I had watched a YouTube video about how easy this could be accomplished, not to mention affordably. He had the same answer after hearing this and re-affirmed to me that this is not something Ford will do, and it would cost me thousands of dollars along with a return of the initial system I have. 

After hanging up with him, I immediately called Leif Johnson Ford. They were friendly, positive and provided a quick ""yes, we can do that for you - no problem"",

1858,1486,09-Mar-18,"Long story here.  I was contacted by my sales person Blake Engels that they had found the Mustang I wanted, so I went in yesterday to talk numbers.  After spending about 30 minutes with Blake and crunching numbers, I finally committed to buying the car.  Once verbally committed, I had to wait about an hour before I sat down with the finance guy.  Everything went great with him and signed all the papers and was told that my car would be on their lot either the following day or the next (the car was located at one of their sister dealerships).  Well come today I text Blake asking for an update and he calls me about an hour later and proceeds to tell me that they no longer have that car…I’m sorry, but how can a dealership possibly sell me a car they don’t even have?!?  I asked him that exact question and he told me the excuse that the car was there that morning, but must have been sold while negotiations were going on with us.  Can someone tell me why in the world they would not check first to make sure it was still available after they got my commitment while I waited an ENTIRE HOUR before signing papers??  I asked that too and again their response was more bs saying they did in fact call the guy, but he just didn’t answer.  Right.  Blake tried to convince me to maybe change the color since they had one available in a different color, but I told him I was dead set on the color (after all they did just sell me a car IN THAT COLOR).  He told me he’d call me right back and 30 minutes later he does call me back and says they’ve located another car and that all was good and he’d call me back in a few days when it was ready.  I asked how he could find another mustang that quickly that had exactly everything I wanted (and had already put a down payment and signed papers for) and that’s when he goes welllll it’s exactly like the one you bought EXCEPT it doesn’t have the active valve exhaust…I honestly couldn’t believe he was going let me drive a car off the lot that had less features than what I had purchased.  I believe he would not have given me the truth had I not asked.  At this point I was done with the bs Blake kept trying to tell me and I told him I wanted his supervisor’s name and would be at the dealership in 10 minutes to talk to them.  When I got to the dealership I spoke to 3 different people and they all told me the same bs and all tried to push the Mustang with less features than the one I had already bought.  I told all 3 of them that I didn’t want to do business with them anymore and I just wanted my refund and all paperwork cancelled.  I had to say this multiple times to every single one of them, as they would not listen.  I was there for a good hour before I was finally able to get my refund and paperwork cancelled.  If you are considering doing business here, please be aware of their shady business practices and do not use Blake, as he is a liar and will try to manipulate you to get the sell.

The car also made a new noise that didn’t exist when I took it in in the first place - an obnoxious scraping sound when I break- which they take zero responsibility for and spent 30 minutes repeating the same nonsense explanation. They also would not call me back when they said they would when they had my car, so I ended up talking to someone else at the shop who very confidently gave me completely incorrect information. 

I didn’t feel at ease with them, so I took it to a trusted neighborhood shop, and they ensured me that the damage was moreso cosmetic (rust from living in snowy areas), and nothing that would make my car fall apart while driving.  They found out why the noises were happening and will do some more investigating, but ultimately the cost will be significantly less than Maxwell quoted.

95,1494,30-Jul-17,"I called during the week to make an appointment and ask about getting three things checked out which are all under warranty since vehicle only has 31k miles. Appt was made for Friday AM.

Drove up on Friday at 7am to get an oil change and get three things inspected: window/wind noise on hwy, engine doesn't shut off when off, and Bluetooth not connecting. I also asked if they could take a look at console because there are always ants there for no reason.

Woman who greets me is very nice and says they probably won't look at it today but hopefully before Monday since their open on Saturday. 

Monday afternoon, I get a call that they haven't even looked at it because they are backed up. She will try and get it looked at the next day.

Tuesday afternoon, I get a call that they haven't looked at it but will try and get oil change done the next day. 

Wednesday afternoon, I don't get a call. Thursday afternoon - no call. And by Friday I'm thinking this is pretty ridiculous because I need my car and I couldn't continue to borrow my father-in-law's car.

So we call and ask to speak with a manager who says he doesn't know why I thought it would be fast because they always take 7-10 days to complete jobs. And that they are actually the fastest then any other dealership. I mention that if I was told it would take 7-10 days I would have declined and just got the oil change. He tells me the oil change was done and they will get to warranty work soon. 

I didn't pick up my vehicle until the next week Tuesday. A month later I'm disappointed to report that the Bluetooth still doesn't work properly, there is still noise on the Hwy, and now the tire lights went on. We checked the tire pressure and they were all at 30 with one tire a little below. Tire pressure should have been inspected with the multipoint inspection and now I don't believe they did anything.

It didn't take long at all to complete the work once they got to it. They need a better system because if they can't even look at a car until 7 days after being dropped off then something needs to change. They should allow the option to customers who are able to be on a waiting list and get called that they can bring their car in the next day or two days before. That way cars aren't sitting there for a week until they get to it. I get that you never know how long one job will take but there has to be an average and another way to do business. Not everyone can be without a car for two weeks.

I didn't even mention that the waiting room is small. When I first dropped off the car we had to wait because the complimentary shuttle driver called in so they asked a mechanic to drive us home. When I did pick up the car they asked if I wanted a car wash which I believe is a given and should have been done already. Then when they brought me my car they told me the car wash was broken.

Since it's a BMW, they wanted me to take it to a BMW dealership to have it checked. However, when i got into my car to leave... there was no such light! I took it to the BMW dealership (which was 20+ miles away) and they said there's nothing wrong with it & that there's nothing to check since the light wasn't on.

I test drove and was then told of $1,800 of dealer add-ons (unadvertised) that I would have to pay for and they would only do the deal if I took a low ball price on a trade-in.. When I asked them to remove the trade-in from negotiations, they actually refused to do the deal altogether unless I traded in because they would lose money at their advertised price plus the $1,800.  They played all sorts of games (back to the manager 4 times) that I thought dealers gave up in the dark ages. I guess they thought we had spent so much time we would not go elsewhere.

Then they had the gall to say all dealers do the same thing and include unadvertised add-ons like they do.

That was the biggest lie. We went to Covert at 183 and got a price less than Maxwells advertised teaser price (with the $1,800 dealer add-ons). No games (back and forth to the manager). Picked our truck and closed the deal in 90 minutes.

First, I found a truck I wanted to look at online in their inventory, when I emailed about the truck the salesman, who I later found out was the used car managers son, called to inform me the truck had been bought. While I was listening to his voicemail a different salesman called to inform me he had located the truck on the lot and was sitting in it while we were speaking. That should have been my first warning but things happen.a couple days later  I drove over an hour and a half to test drive the vehicle, it was in good shape from all outward appearances and was still under factory warranty. While driving I noticed the back up camera wasn’t working so when we went to the desk I made that known to the assistant manager of used car sales, at least that’s what I was told he was. His response initially was that it would be taken care of, that soon changed to “well, the truck is still under factory warranty so if you take it to them they will take care of it for you”, his words. That should have been the second red flag. At this point I’m tired of looking at trucks so I just let them appraise my trade in. In my conversations with the salesman I had told him I had a written appraisal from a different dealer and I was assured they would beat or match it, no problem there. Their appraisal was 2500 below what I had in writing from the other dealer. At this point I asked for my keys back, the salesman( a different one that the first I had spoken with) was visibly shocked that I was not going to play his games, in fact his response was “why?, that was only the first one”. He informed me the appraiser still had my keys and he would have to go get them. I specifically said to bring me my keys and nothing else, I didn’t want to speak to a manager or anyone else, just bring me my keys. The appraisal manager, at least that what he introduced himself to me as, decided to come out and show me a piece of paper he printed out showing where he got his numbers from. This piece of paper had no official markings or logos from any auctions, firms, or businesses on it, it was literally a piece of paper he typed up and printed out and tried to pass off. After retieiving my keys from him I was headed out the door and ran into the first “manager” I had encountered, he was perplexed as to why I was leaving without buying the truck that they were refusing to fix before being sold. Of this is the kind of service they are giving I will take my business elsewhere, there were plenty of other dealerships willing to take the 40k I had to spend on a truck without making me feel like a I wasn’t worth their time.

I talked to one person who told me what to send and what car I wanted then nothing. Tried to call the finance department only to be hung up on and I mean they picked up the phone and hung up like I was bothering them.

I made many calls to the person I was talking to and even got a contact number for another person and left many voicemails only never to get a response.

I bought the warranty! Well my car sat at Patterson VW in Tyler for almost a month, Brinson provided a loaner car. Patterson jumped through every hoop asked by the Ford ESP warranty. Yet they still wouldn't pay for the engine to be replaced. One day alone, I made 12 calls to Brinson... and never received a call back. I have called so many times that they know me when I call.

1960,1599,22-Apr-18,"I would give them 0 stars - I should have done this months ago but I got busy and am just now getting to it.  As I go to file a complaint about Brinson Ford - Athens, I see that their ratings are already pitiful.  Now it makes sense, they just don't care.  My complaint is that they are very unethical and be sure to check your mileage of your new & old car before signing off on it.  I don't see where they did anything illegal (or at least can't prove it because I was not there at the time of purchase).  My 80 year old grandma with the help of a daughter purchased a used car from them in May.  Several people pointed out that the car had a damaged frame (as if it had been wrecked and repaired).  The dashboard lights would randomly come on, low tires/gas cap open/engine warning light/inaccurate cruise control setting. After repeated visits to Brinson Ford, the only suggestions the service department gave here was to trade it in for a price much lower than her purchase price.  (Shortly after she purchased it, she went into the hospital for two weeks and then couldn't drive for another two weeks.)  She went back 6/10, alone.  She was talked into trading the used car that she owned less than two months for a new car.  The paperwork says she drove over 600 miles in that short time.  There is no way she even went 200 miles.  She went in to speak with her salesman, Scot, and he convinced her that the Focus was not enough for her, she needed a Fusion.  The owners manual was not in the car and after repeated requests, she said Jarvis Coper was very helpful and got that together with her plates and spare key.  I went over all of the paperwork and went in to talk to the finance manager.  The sale was done, we were not asking to give the car back and get our money.  I wanted to know their side of the story before I posted her side on the internet.  I asked if they told her how much she would be losing if she traded it in.  Mike or Mark (whoever the finance guy is) said that they go over the numbers in detail.  A typical ""little old lady"" isn't going to understand your ""details"" but she would understand if you said ""you are about to lose $8000"".   These guys lack then ability to put themselves in the place of anyone else.  All they are seeing is $$$$.  My question was ""how would you feel if your mother/grandmother/wife/sister/daughter felt like someone took advantage of them all because they didn't want to 'bother' you?""  The guy was either flustered or didn't understand the policies that he is selling.  He wanted to argue about her needing GAP insurance.  I read the contract, we can call and cancel so that does not concern him.  I had to correct him on how GAP insurance works.  Hopefully he knows and was just caught off guard.  As for the extended warranty, I wanted a refund for that.  He did show me where they pro-rated it and applied it to her down payment on the new car, which is fair but was very rude and hostile about the entire situation.  He then continued to argue the extended warranty sale on the new car and refused to refund that.  He said it was not possible for the way they created the loan.  When you choose 0% interest, you are losing out on other rebates.  The dealers will push it but it is not always worth it.  That was the case here.  She bought a brand new car, got a $1500 rebate... so paid 1500 less than sticker price.  When it comes down to it, they made a lot of money off this little old lady.  Talking to him was like talking to a programmed minion, almost like he was reading a phrase it out of a book, repeating it over and over.  He doesn't know anything but what he was told.",1,29,0,0

They said 36000 bumper to bumper warranty doesnt cover that. We tried getting the car in months ago before 12000 miles and they kept saying not to bring it in until it makes the noise. The noise would come and go so they said dont bring. Now they say they cant fix it.

1977,1617,02-Jun-20,"Date line 5/22/2020 I called about a 2016 CPO Ford Escape that Grapevine Ford had advertised. Was contacted immediately and they went through their spill about how if I would fill out a credit app they would come of the price $500 even though I had told them is was a cash deal. Was told they are not a front of house dealership and did not do cash discounts. Now I was quoted $18,800+- for the car they had advertised for $16500.  I asked for an explanation and the oh so smart salesman said it included some anti theft gimmick that was $500 plus and an extra key that was $500 plus because there was only one with the car, also ttl for Oklahoma that he said was required by them to include at 4 1/2 %, which I knew was a lie. There was still $700 dollars difference in their so called out the door price, come to find out he had also tried to include dealer finance fees or some other nonsense. Finally he says $16,183.33 which I agreed to and made sure it would include a 2nd key which magically appeared while on the phone. He said ""i have it right here in my hand."" So, reluctantly, I agree to drive down the next morning and meet at 9 am and if everything checks out would make the deal. I should have known better! Get there and drive the car which was advertised as having lane assist and the brake assist and back up alarms all features that I wanted for my daughter. Thought it was me and that I had not activated features so, when I returned to dealer and asked how to activate. He gets in and fumbles around not saying anything except let me printout the window sticker and he took off to his office, brought it back and started off on how rare this gem of a car was to have traction control?!? I asked again about the 
lane assist and other safety features. He says oh, this car does not have those features, they are only available on 2020 models! I said your internet ad states that it does, so he tells me, ""Well I dont write those ads."" 
Then totally exasperated I walk out as he is saying ""We have 2020's."" Wow, what a piece of work, I am stunned that dealerships like this exist and this was my first and last experience with Grapevine Ford. I have always bought from Huffines in Corinth Classic in Sherman and always treated with respect and make transparent deals. Oh, and he also said they have the lowest priced dealer ad ons in the metroplex, bragging rights??? Part of the double talk I have  left out for times sake that were just as bogus as the rest. Anyway, buyer beware as they always say! Not going to mention the assistant sales managers name, but you know who you are, I was not your sucker customer of the day.  Buyer's please know what you are getting into on these deals, always ask for a full disclosure of fees and there close to 100% profit add ons are a hoax.
 The absolute worst part of this is they have these huge floor displays of the 10 rules of ethics, yeah right! By the way, those $500 keys are usually around $200 retail at honest dealerships and can be had all day online for $100.

1980,1620,14-Dec-19,"Short version...I went in to make a deal on a 2019 Hyundai Santa Fe but could not come to an agreement with Garry, mainly because of the $500 Kahu tracking device they supposedly already put on the car (even though they just received the car and it hadn't even been detailed or service) and could not remove. He said it adds value to the car and insurance companies will give discounts for having it. Well I asked my insurance broker and he said most insurance companies do NOT give a discount. My daughter does not need to spend $500 for something that is worthless to her but apparently Grapevine Ford forces on you, period. After spending an hour there Garry said he could come off the price of the car $500 and reduce the cost of the Kahu theft recovery system to $251 and then told me that he couldn't take my deposit money to hold the car anyway, until my daughter got in town. I told them in the beginning that this I was helping my daughter find a car and she wouldn't be in town for another week. Why did he waste an hour of my life if he already knew this! Then a couple of days later Dustin calls me (the original sales manager who wasn't working when I went back the second day to put money down) and asked what he could do to earn my business. I told him all I was asking was to come down $500 (off a $27,500 car by the way) and remove the $500 Kahu system. He told me he would see what he could do and call me back. Well it's been 4 days and he never called back. My daughter will be in town tomorrow to purchase her ""new"" car so we're headed to Austin to purchase basically the same car with a few thousand more miles for $1,300 less.

There is so much to cover and I'm not in the habit of leaving negative feedback, even when mediocre service is tendered.  However in this instance I think that for the sake of future buyers at your dealership I should say something. 

My experience in a nut shell. 
     Pros:  * Brian Rojas was attentive, personable and helpful as my salesperson.
               * The vehicle was in the condition it was advertised as being, and was delivered clean and full of fuel. 

      Cons:
                 * I made it implicitly clear with my salesperson and the sales manager, that I had guaranteed financing with my bank and that this would be treated as a cash deal.  They said they needed my credit information to run a quick check to ensure my information was valid.   I said to the salesperson ""You are not running my credit for financing, correct? He said yes, for sure.""   The new car sales manager Blane Castorena came to talk to me and asked if he could beat the deal my credit union gave me could they try to run my credit for a try.   I said, thank you but no, I did not want my credit pulled again and that I was comfortable staying with my bank.   When I went into financing and signed the documents, I asked for the sales document to give to my credit union, and the finance manager said oh, Blane Castorena told me that if I could beat you rate that you would finance, even though the salesperson disagreed and said that was not the case.  So long story short I went ahead and financed with their bank even though it completely irked me to do so. 
                  * Given the financing fiasco enumerated above, I tried to get insurance on my new car, but none of my finance paperwork shows a lean holder and the agreement to furnish insurance has the loss holder as none.  Had to call my poor sales guy back to chase down the information. 
                  * The car wasn't inspected and I need to go back to the dealership to complete.   

After all of this the finance manager felt really bad and gave me two free oil changes, I was okay and left mostly satisfied, given the not so pleasant experience mentioned above.  So much so that I was talking with a family friend, showing her the car and telling her the deal I got.   She wanted the same deal so I called my sales person back and asked if he could make that happen.  He said he could and we set up an appointment on Monday 11/25. 

I go with my friend to the dealership, and my salesperson said he had a doctors appointment and so he handed us off to another sales person.  Although this was okay, it was not ideal.   The new salesperson was great and we made it work.   I trying to work the same deal, all over again, because of the salesperson change.  All I wanted was the internet advertised price and the two discounts that she qualified for.   They came out with a different price and as you can imagine had questions, the salesperson didn't feel completely comfortable answering all of them, so he went and asked Blane Castorena to come out and explain, yes the same Blane Castorena that outright lied to the finance manager on my deal.   I put that aside and asked him for explanation of each of the numbers, which is within my rights.    He then turned to me and asked are you buying this?   I said no, that my friend was, but that she appointed me as her agent.  He then turned from me to her and said, I'm only going to deal with her because she is the one buying.   So he turned to her started grilling her, and she was panicking, I told him to talk with me and she told him the same.  He then became extremely rude, though back the chair and walked away, I said really?  You're going to treat a customer this way, you're not following your dealerships service credo, will I just need to talk to your manager.   He said ohh I'm so scared, and then when in his glass frame office and when in cover he called me an xxxxxxx!!!

At this point I was furious, I asked my salesmen for Blane's manger and he just grabbed another dude standing in the office, I'm pretty sure it was not the Blane's superior.  The tried to smooth it over, but my friend decided that she did not want to give them her business so we left.   

I'm within my 3-day purchase window and I'm seriously considering taking the car I bought back.  I bought the vehicle for my daughter and already presented it to her, that is the only reason I haven't taken it back, in fear of breaking her heart. 

I'm so very disappointed and when the dealership assessment comes back from Ford, this comment will go in it.   For the sake of future customer's I hope that something comes of this so that Blane Castorena becomes afraid to treat customers like he treated me. ",1,30,0,1

When I get there Bridget, who was the person I was supposed to see, said that I never scheduled an appointment. When I showed her my conformation see looked it up, then she found me. Then she says that they are behind by 4 days so I will have to leave my car there for 4 days before they even look at it. So I asked Bridget if there was a loner that I could get because I need a car to get to work. She tells me loners are cars that we give to you and you have to bring it back in the same condition that I got it in. I was like that's so rude she was acting like I would not be responsible with a loner, first of all I'm a valet, so I know how to handle others cars with care, and second, I've had a loner before. After all that she says without checking her computer or anything that she doesn't have a loner till next week and set me an appointment for then. I left there so angry, she just waisted my time and I left there with just another appointment. So I called McDavid Lincoln in plano and they gave me an appointment on the same day and when I got there, Ed who is a service associate over there was way nicer than the people at Grapevine, not only did they look at the car the same day, within 2 hours Ed ordered the part and I was on my way home.

I am currently living and working in China, so I asked if it would be possible to do the sale.  I was told by Gus, the manager over purchasing, that it would be possible.  He had me sign some papers, and said that as soon as the title arrived he would send me a check for the amount agreed upon.  Following that, I went to the airport.  A couple weeks after this I learned from the people sending the title that it had been received at Grapevine Ford a week prior.  At this point I called Gus and was told he would be sending me the check via FedEx, and would give me a tracking number.  Several days passed and I had not heard from him.  I contacted him again, and was told that FedEx would not deliver a check.  He told me he would have the comptroller wire the money, so I provided him very sensitive bank information.  Again several days passed with no word, so I contacted Gus.  He told me he had given the comptroller the information and that he believed they had sent it.  Several days later there was nothing sent to the bank, so I contacted Jennifer James, the comptroller directly.  I was only able to reach her voicemail, and after several attempts decided this was a dead end.  I finally reached Gus again, and was told that they were unable to wire the money.  He told me they had sent the check via USPS, but he does not have the tracking number.  He told me he would get the tracking number and send it to me today.  This has not happened, and I am now filing this, believing that I have had my car basically stolen and sold by this dealership.  ",1,30,0,0

Appointment confirmed 24 hrs in advance.  Arrived 15 minutes early for the appointment.  Salesperson I was to see was off.  Attempt to T/O me to someone else who knew nothing about what I was looking for, etc.  this for me is a deal breaker and told the T/O guy so.

I had to return the following week for the tint to be put on since their tint guy was off when I purchased it. A tire sensor was out as well. I got there before 9am and was given a loaner. I went to mall and came out to two police cruisers by the loaner. The salesman didn’t put a temporary tag on and police had called dealership and was told it was missing. After that was straightened out I went back to dealership and ended up waiting until 5pm for a tint and sensor replacement. 
Returned today for the 6 month reapplication of the ZAKTEK paint protection. They have a 2 to 3 week wait time for it so you need to schedule an appointment a few weeks in advance. When you work 6 days a week with the occasional weekday off, how do you schedule that?",1,30,0,0

Multiple items have not been finished, but the most frustrating are the powder coated wheels. The dealer offered this to “close” the deal and provided an IOU b/c they wanted me to come back later and have multiple items completed. Now they will not schedule the work. Additionally, no member of management will speak with me, return an email, or call me back. This dealership will pressure you to close and then will not deliver. It seems like this is standard practice the way people answer the phones and explain why management are too busy to take a call. I would stay away from Grapevine Ford at all costs.",1,30,0,0
1993,1633,11-Jun-19,"I purchased a used vehicle here 6 months ago.  Terrible experience from the beginning.  Completely lied to by the Finance Manager.  Multiple things wrong with the vehicle that were never repaired to my satisfaction.  Major repairs required after 2 months, had to take it back.  Caliper bolt was left loose or out, caliper came loose going down the highway causing loss of fluid and complete brake failure.  Did not repair the vehicle correctly again.  Now they have had my vehicle for several weeks and I cannot even get anyone to call me back or give me an update.  The Customer Loyalty Director will not call me back or answer my email.  Terrible customer service from the beginning and it just gets worse.  The entire dealership and management seems to not care at all about the lies or the poor workmanship from the service department.

1994,1635,01-Jun-19,"Can I give zero stars? If Ford ever wondered why they are losing brand value to the Japanese brands I have the reason. I’ve purchased three Toyota’s in 18 years and have put over 400K miles on them. I decided to purchase a NEW truck for the first time ever. I settled on the nearly 80K Ford Raptor as a 40th present to myself. At 6000 miles I started having oil pressure issues and transmission issues. The dealer I purchased it from said I should bring it in. I did that at 8,000 miles. I brought it in and must say that Grapevine Ford must be the worst service organization. The service group was lightly staffed on that day and had to search for someone to give my truck to.  The two service managers were not around, but I grabbed their cards. I left messages with both of them. One never called me back and the other’s VM says it’s broken so I need to text him, which I did. While I was waiting around I asked for some water and was told “there is a water fountain inside.” No attempts to say “let me go get that or offer a bottle water.” No attempts to go the extra mile when I clearly have major issues. The manager and I spoke on Monday and when I asked him about a loaner his response was “Did you buy that with the warranty?” Wow! Didn’t realize I needed to do that as I never bought a new car and quite frankly never had an issue with one of the Toyota’s in all those years. I would expect that you spend $80K on a car that would be the least they would do when it’s determined I have  head gaskets and transmission issues four months after purchase. I Ubered for a week and had great customer service. Upon picking it up on Friday I got in to find they had driven it for about 40 miles based on the paperwork. Did they fill it up with gas after making the repairs? Nope. Did they even wash it with all the dirt from having service guys all over it. No again. I asked about it and the response was astounding. “If you were my customer I would have made sure it was washed.” Really? So, the 80K I spent at Ford doesn’t constitute me as your customer. Ford just doesn’t get it. Fact is I WAS your customer, but will never return to Grapevine Ford let alone purchase another Ford.",1,30,0,0

Even though I had the same problem less than 2 years ago and they repaired it and could pull it up in the system.  They decided that they wanted to look at my engine and attempted to try to convince me that the issue it was due to an engine issue but wasn’t too sure about that.

1997,1638,30-Apr-19,"Have two ford vehicles, one purchased at Grapevine Ford.  Since it is the closest Ford dealer to me, I have always taken both cars to them for anything and everything.  My hope was that I would be working with trustworthy people that won't try and take advantage of me, in hopes I'll buy my future vehicles here.  That was my plan. 

Check engine light came on my truck, inside my 100k mile warranty.  Without getting a call, I received my inspection results via email survey type thing called AutoPoint.  There were 9 items totaling $2,700.  In order to see the second item, you had to either accept or decline the first item (worth $650).. all while my truck is with them.  Imagine clicking ""Accept"" on 9 items totaling $2,700 in order to see all of the items they've suggested.  

I took this exact list (who knows if I even needed all 9 items) to a highly rated auto service nearby.  These 9 items totaled $750 there.  

I was in every other month and there were many people who I thought I developed a relationship with and could trust.  However, it is very disappointing to me that I cannot continue to take my Ford vehicles to my nearest Ford dealer because they are focused on sales instead of service.  I hope one day their model will change to become more service based.  Big bummer having to break up with them. ",1,30,0,0
1998,1639,28-Apr-19,"I went in for an oil change, and was harassed by one of the more senior guys in the service department who was training the gentleman who was supposed to be helping me out until I agreed to buy new tires. I told him I had to be back in a couple of weeks and we could discuss it then, but he continued to push and refused to accept my answer. He told me my oil change was free because I had paid for the MPP Care Coverage (which I still have the paperwork for), then turned around and charged me $38 for it. I was also charged $24.50 for ""customer pay environmental disposal fees for repair order,"" when I did not have any repairs done, and had already been charged separately for the tire disposal. They also did not document the required ""DOT number"" on all four of my tires for the extra protection I had purchased, despite charging me for it on the previous page. I was barely even given enough time to see where I needed to sign before they were rudely rushing me out the door.

TLDR; If you're thinking of getting your vehicle serviced here, I'd recommend looking elsewhere unless you'd like to get charged more than you were expecting, and be talked down to by people who don't listen. ",1,30,0,0

This was a turn-off for me. I decided to just pay cash outright and the salesman informed me that I would need to pay a $1000 fee to do so, since they would be losing revenue from financing.

We have owned 4 Ford Expeditions and like Ford.  We purchased our last Ford from Grapevine Ford and thus continued going to them for our service.  We had an incident a couple of years ago where we were told by service that we needed something that it turns out we DID NOT.  We brought the supposed problem to be evaluated at another Ford dealership and we were told the problem didn't exist. After alot of time and energy Grapevine Ford admitted their wrong and made it right, but I put a high emphasis on alot of work to make them accept responsibility of wrong doing (down right unethical in my opinion).       In May I brought my car in for a oil change and left with an estimate of over $5500 of recommended things.  

Recently our son brought his car in for an oil change and he was told by the advisor that is tie end rods were in critical need of repair and recommended he fix them right then. My husband was called and he determined he needed to get another opinion.  Two mechanics looked at the vehicle and determined that there was no problem with tie end rods. We met with the tech, advisor and supervisor to have the vehicle put up on rack and the tech put his hands on tires and said see they are bad. We asked him to do it at the brand new car next to his car which was also up on rack and it looked exactly the same.  They had every opportunity to back step and admit it was a incorrect call and didn't  We went and talked to the person that was involved in my expedition and he said let me look at and I said the car is gone but we will have one more mechanic look at it and then call him  Another mechanic looked at it and said the tie end rods are tight and fine and wouldnt recommend anything be done because nothing needed to be done. A call was made to the second person and the GM of the dealership. We never received any call back. Not one.  I called and talked to the second supervisor and all he said was well thanks for calling and bye.  Sad that a dealership has such little regard for morals and ethical behavior.",1,30,0,0
361,1645,13-Jan-19," I had totaled my car and was trying to find a new one. I knew what I wanted and I needed to make the best deal possible that I could afford. Grapevine Ford had the car that I wanted, but when I told them what I was willing to pay I was told that they would see what they could do and call me the next day.  They never called me the next day.
I called back and asked why I hadn't been called back about the deal I was asking for. I didn't get an answer, just an apology and promise to call back later.  Again, no call back.  When I called again to ask why I hadn't been called back I was told that the car had been sold to someone else so they didn't call me. It seemed like they were stalling until they could sell the car to someone else for their asking price.  Then they wanted me to come back to look at other vehicles.  I reluctantly told them I would the next day.  In the meantime I got online and found what I wanted at another dealership. I went there the next morning and did a test drive. They were willing to make the deal I wanted if I would purchase the car before I left. I left there as the owner of the new car that I wanted.
Grapevine Ford's asking price for the car I wanted was less than the one at the other dealership. They didn't want to take my offer, but the other dealership made my deal even though their car was priced higher than the one at Grapevine Ford.
All I can say is don't waste your time with Grapevine Ford.  You may have to drive a little further to get what you want, but it will be totally worth it.  ",1,30,0,0
2004,1646,28-Dec-18,Fransicso and Kurt or Kirk (not sure what he said) were the most unprofessional people I have ever dealt with at a dealership. They were both extremely disrespectful and argumentative. I would have been more than happy to follow their procedure if they had told me about their procedure. I'm not mad that they would not make me an offer on my car / trade in. My issue was how they treated me during and after the experience. I feel like after driving 30 miles at their request kurt/Kirk could have at least come out and talk to me not send me a text telling me they weren't going to make an offer. It would have also been great if they were not both extremely diasrespectful in the way they were talking to me on the phone when I called to ask why they would not at least make an offer after asking me to drive that far.

Status:  2014 Ford Explorer - brought in THREE times in 6 months for various problems.  Each time swore I wouldn't be back.

First time - Axle issue - took more than two weeks, and NO communication.   I had to constantly call.  When finally done, I go to pick it up and the LOST MY KEYS!   Had to wait an extra day!

Second time - Transmission issue - took more than Seven Days, NO communication, I had to constantly call for updates.   I go to pick it up, and they CAN'T FIND THE CAR.  I waited 45 minutes before they brought it up.   Got it home, rear view camera doesn't work.

Third & Final - Camera and Battery issue.  Booked a 7am appointment, there on time - took the car, and again by 5pm I had to call for status, to be told need another day.   Next day, given diagnosis - Two year old battery, still under warranty - told need new one, but not covered under warranty.  Camera went ""bad"" need a new one - total bill $1100!   I pushed back on warranty for both, and gave the most illogical excuse I ever heard.  As if I were stupid!  Bob (service rep) directly was offensive (apologized later). I said don't do work, I'll come get it.  I go to pick up....waited 20 minutes for them to find BOB just to hand me my keys.

2010,1653,24-Jul-18,"Foremost, even if you choose to go to this dealership after you read my review, DO NOT sign the arbitration clause if you buy a car as part of your agreement. It was an unbelievably terrible experience at the dealership from the receptionist to the salesperson to the manager level personnel. We negotiated a good price on a truck and agreed to buy the vehicle and after all paperwork done and downpayment given (with trade-in), they refused to give the truck to us. I think it was because they either sold it ""again"" to someone else or we did not buy any additional services like insurance from them. 

They played games and told us to come back the next day to pick up the truck. We go at 11am time which was given and it was in ""detail"" so we waited and one guy came and said there was confusion so to come later in the afternoon at 1pm and the truck will be out of detail and ready for pickup. We go at 3 pm and still the truck is not ready and they claim it is going to go in detail. So obvious reaction is frustration. A manager called us in and yelled at us in her office and said to get out of dealership and they won't give us the truck. We called the cops however it is a civil case. 

We hired an attorney to enforce the agreement both parties already signed however they cancelled our loan without our permission and said the contract was null and void. Also, the arbitration clause in the agreement ceases your right to sue them for this cheating and scam. 

After this incident, we just went and bought a truck at the 5 star ford in north Richland hills and they have excellent service and no arbitration clause when you buy a vehicle. That just tells you they are honest and not scamsters and cheaters like this dealership. WE spoke with at least 5-6 individuals in our own network who had the same terrible experience and went somewhere else to buy.

2012,1655,22-Jun-18,"The worst experience dealing with people and a dealership in my life. Horrible customer service, reluctant to acknowledge mistakes and take responsibility, unprofessional communication, or none at all from sales to management. Purchased a ""supposed"" Certified Pre-Owned 2014 Mustang on May 11, 2018 and have regretted it ever since. I was expecting the 172-point inspection to give me assurance of a reliabile, mostly damage free, vehicle with low mileage. Not at all what I received. Every negative issue with vehicle was the ""previous owner's fault or doing"", as stated by management. After certifying a vehicle by, and for, Ford, I am concerned by the issues that would not have passed even my inspection, that passed and qualified this vehicle to be a CPO vehicle. I purchased vehicle from dealership not previous owner, so if there were discrepancies or issues not up to Grapevine Ford 'standards', they should have been corrected before selling it, period. This vehicle was purchased for a graduation present for son, but I have not been able to give to him because of these & other issues. It has now been at dealership for a 7 days, when I was given a 3-4 day status that included a weekend. Do you think anyone had the common courtesy to provide me an update? No, and when I call for an update, 
I get a 'smug' attitude and a statement, 'Okay, if you want me to call and say there's no information, then I'll call and say there's no information"". I guess he gets the smugness from his boss who had previously stated,  he needed to hurry up and get my car fixed, cause he couldn't sell the 'loaner' with me driving it. Wow...and they wonder why people complain about their dealership. Sir, I have no interest in driving a Ford Fusion, period. We are here, because your dealership has failed in doing its' job. The sale of MY VEHICLE is in question and should be your priority to get it right, NOT the sale of a 'loaner'. Someone, if not the subordinate, who feels after a week that there's no information to provide ,should have called me after they realized it was going to take longer than promised/told; definitely before I called them (7 days later). Also, especially since my issues were treated as trivial when I brought it in. I was now being provided with ""information"" that my car isn't ready, and is still on the first issue to be corrected. So, I guess my plans don't matter? That 'no information' is now infringing on my family vacation, college, and other summer plans. I REALLY JUST WANT MY MONEY BACK AND THEY CAN KEEP IT. I NEVER WANT TO DEAL WITH THEM EVER IN LIFE. I DON'T WANT THE WARRANTY THERE EITHER. 
I have patiently tried to resolve issues (4 emails so far) even with Sr. management, with no response or phone call from them either. I was finally able to make an appt. with Tracy, Asst. GM., after not being able to communicate professionally with a Mr. Kaba in finance. (horrible). After an hour long conversation with her, I was so stressed out that I had to go to emergency room and cancel that next day appt. Even though she was able to communicate with me in a professional tone and manner, the many issues with vehicle including: no CPO paperwork provided as of yet, no signed contract received at dealership on day of signing, lack of respect or acknowledgement to previous emails and concerns, & providing a huge cash down payment for the vehicle, and the feeling of being taken advantage of by finance, I had a serious panic/anxiety attack after speaking with her. How hard is it for salesman/designated employee to call customer and see if they are happy with purchase or have issues? How hard is it to respond to an email or forward email  to someone who can/does respond and RESOLVE issues? How hard is it to update customer w/status of vehicle that will take longer than stated? How hard is it to not belittle, downtalk, or make satirical comments to customer and remain professional? I was also told, ""I will have Tracy give you a shout"". A shout?? Is this a professional place of business??
Such a Beautiful dealership, but it's just a cover for the ""ugliness"" waiting for you inside. BUYER BEWARE!! If I was the owner, I would definitely be embarrassed and very disappointed in my team.",1,30,0,0

I was in the market looking for a Mustang GT and the salesperson I spoke on the phone wasn't available when I reached, so another one took over. Anyways, I knew what I wanted and I told him I wanted a GT with the 401A package/Shaker Audio/Driver Memory Seat. The person went and got another person just to tell me ""Mustangs don't come with power seats"". I was shocked that they didn't know their own cars and this is a Ford dealership. Well from there he went on to challenge me to show him a Mustang with power seats. I was surprised but kept calm and told him that I test drove a car at a different dealership with the specs. He still refused and was rude. So, I showed him one online. No apologies, nothing. He was like ""Huh, so they have it."" That's it. It is one thing to not know you vehicles, whole another level to be rude and not apologize afterwards, especially when it was your mistake. That made me realize how tough it would be to deal with them after I got the car. So, I didn't discuss any further and left. None of the 3 salespersons tried to talk to me or anything. I'm better off taking my money to a good dealership.
Well, you would want to make a large ticket purchase only at a reputed dealer with good and courteous sales people, so my advice - ""STAY AWAY"". There are a lot of Ford dealers in DFW that can give you a better service than here on any day.",1,30,0,0

362,1659,19-Feb-18,I have bought two vehicles from Grapevine Ford and everything was great but now they are engaging in faulty and deceptive advertising. Grapevine Ford post the MSRP on their website but the actual resale could be 20% higher. It is acceptable to add a premium due to demand and availability but they need to make that clear on advertising and sticker price. All other dealerships advertise true price. Very disappointed as they were very straight forward in the past.,1,30,0,0
2016,1660,29-Jan-18,"Seriously worst dealership I ever had to deal with! I know going to a dealership is usually not a fun experience and they all want to get as much money out of you as possible but this place is by far the worst. First off they put amazing prices on their website for vehicles and once you call or actually go to the dealership to check it out the car is either "" just sold this past week"" or they will make up a fee and add a ridiculous amount of money to it. Oh and if your wanting to trade your car in, don't expect to get anything Kelly Blue Book, NADA, or any other online website thinks the trade in value is. Apparently they just make their own price up for that too. So, I went in there to take a look at a new 2018 mustang and trade my 2014 mustang in which has 55,000 miles, only been washed by hand, only used royal purple oil for oil changes, and I put close to $1,000 into it putting custom leather seat covers in it, adding weather tech floor mats, and tinted the windows with a lifetime guarantee. They wanted to give me $8,500 for trading it in. I told the sales rep I looked it up on Kelly Blue Book and it says the trade in value is $11,059 not including the money I put in it. He said KBB is a western company and that they use NADA. So, I looked up the NADA trade in value. The NADA clean trade in value is $11,575. Then, I was talking to a sales manager trying to negotiate a price and I told him about the NADA trade in value, and no joke he tells me they don’t use NADA to look at trade in values, they use this other website. I can’t remember what that site was called. To make this story short, we couldn't come to agreement on the trade in or the final price of the car. Two days later, I look online and find a New 2018 Ford Raptor at the same dealership for $51,080. Amazing price right! So when I called them and tried to see if they still have it in stock and see what the price was, the person I talked to said there was not any sale reps in the dealership at the moment and they would call me back as soon as one comes in. This was at 8:15 am they open at 7:00 am. That seemed kind of fishy to me.  So I had a friend of mine call them 5 minutes later, and guess who answers, a sales rep. He told my friend the vehicle is in stock, but you need to add a $10,000 fee to the MSRP sticker price, so the final price is $61,000. 45 minutes later a female sales rep gave me a call. This sales rep said the vehicle is in stock but you have to add $15,000 to the MSRP sticker price. I said why do you have to add $15,000? And no lie, she stuttered and actually took a while to come up with an excuse as to why they add that much to it. She then asked me if I wanted to come see it and I said I only wanted to come see it if I can get it for the price you advertised on your website. She then said, “Ya we can’t sell it to you for that price"". I then texted the sticker for the vehicle to the sales rep I talked to about the mustang. He texted me back saying, ""yes that vehicle is in stock"". I then texted him if he wanted to sell a truck today and sell me for the price on their website and on the sticker then I will come up there and purchase it that day. You probably guessed it he never texted me back. So if you want some advice, I would not go to this dealership. All they do is play games, make up numbers, and try to screw people over. If you see a good price online for this dealership just add a minimum of $10,000 to it and that’s the real price. Also, I would never trade my car into this place. Expect to get a couple thousand dollars less than what the trade in value should be.",1,30,0,0

2022,1666,18-Aug-17,"Two bad experiences here... First I had cracked windshield with 75 miles on new 2016 f150 so took it to service department to see if it was covered under warranty...it wasn't, but the bad part was the fact that no one greeted me, I had to go inside where no one came to see what I was there for, I finally found a service person in a cubicle talking with another service person about a personal issue and they acted as if I was putting them out by asking for their assistance. When I took my truck to Five Star Ford for a second opinion at least someone greeted me when I pulled in and immediately got someone to help me.
   Second time, I only went back because I had a coupon, was for an oil change and tire rotation. I had an appointment, but they said still a two hour wait when I arrived. I specifically asked if they top off the fluids and yes was the answer. I was checking oil two days later and saw the washer fluid was almost dry and I hadn't used any, so they didn't top off. Then a tire showed to be low and after some airing up of the tire and some logical reasoning I figured out that the display for tire pressures was not showing correct tire to be low...they had not reset the display when rotating tires...I went to Discount tire and they took care of it.

5,1668,03-Aug-17,"First, I was called to Ft. Worth on a serious family health crisis. As an aside, I am elderly, and this trip was not easy for me. Mid-way my engine light came on, so I stopped at a dealership. They gave me an all-clear to get to Ft. Woth; however, they to9ld me to go to a certified Lincoln dealership before driving back to New Braunfels, Texas. My family drove me to Grapevine Ford Lincoln. I dealt with a certain man who was polite and courteous. He advise me to leave my Lincoln Town car which I did. It might be good to mention I have a bumper to bumper warranty.; however, I digress. The man called me later that day and told me this and that needed to be done. I was also told it would take three days to accomplish tasks. Then a few days later I was told the car was ready. I was driven back to the dealership and presented with a bill of $2,000.00. I almost choked. I wrote a check and left. I did not even drive the car during the week I remained in Ft. Worth. After a week's visit, I began to drive back to New Braunfels. I was half way there when the engine began to clatter. In addition, I noticed that my 20mpg gas mileage had dropped to 17 mpg. I phoned Grapevine and spoke to the same man. He told me I would have to return the car...some 450 miles... for them to correct issues. Instead I drove to a friend who owns the Goodyear store. His people could not find out what the Grapevine mechanics had done wrong. I presented him with the spread sheet I had been given. He then went to his computer, retrieved my complete file and said to me...""You were hosed by the Grapevine dealership."" He then meticulously went over each item showing me he had just recently done the very same work items. My health has declined considerably; however, I can advise the dealership that I intend to write a certified letter to Mr. Carl Sewel whom I believe owns that dealership. If anyone reads this and is concerned, they may have the general manager contact me personally to refund every single cent of my transaction. I do not intend to speak with anyone other than the overall dealership manager... or Mr. Sewel If I do not hear anything within ten days, a certified letter will be sent to the owner/partners. In addition, I will file a detailed complaint with the FTC and the BBB.  I have read some of these commentaries and it seems that dealership needs to clean house of certain employees.

	8:16 am I missed a call from Shane Worsham.  I returned his call at 8:38am and he told me to tell him which engine I wanted to tell him when to deliver the truck.  I told him no one called me and this is the first time I have heard about an engine for my truck.  He told me Keith email me and I should have gotten the email quote.  I told him I would get back to him that I had to check my email.  I returned to the service dept after work and asked if my truck was covered with the 36 month unlimited mile warranty?  Shane told me that the quotes were for new engines because at this point I needed a new engine.  I told him $3600 is all that i have because they messed up my engine.  If you completely broke it you should completely fix it.  I was informed that i can either buy a new or used engine less the $3600 i have already paid and come pick up my truck.  I told him to put my truck back together and  refund my money and deliver it to my home address and then I was told they don't have  towing service and I would have to tow it myself.

I had taken my 3 year old truck in for service, because I have the Ford service package, and this was the closest Ford dealership to my home.  When I got it back it back the last time, they didn't wash it as normal, and they parked it in a way that they don't normally (they didn't pull it into the pick up area,  they parked it so the front end was up against a wall of the dealership's garage). I was in a hurry, so I wasn't concerned about the wash. I took the truck home and found that the front end had been marred, with scratches to the grill, large scratches on the front end and hood, and the front fascia pushed out of alignment.  There was no damage to the front bumper, so it was clear to me that no other vehicle had caused the damage. 

I had a dashcam in my truck, but when I went to receive the memory card, I found that the camera had been damaged, as if the person who damaged the truck tried to remove the memory card from the camera. The camera was no longer functional.

I called the dealership and received no response, so I drove down there and met with the service manager,  Shane Worsham, who stated he would review the security video of the vehicle pulling into the dealership to ensure the damage was not there when I pulled into the dealership. He told me he would be out of town for a week, but he would follow up with me upon his return. 

A week and a half later, I had not heard from Shane, so I called him, and he told me he had totally forgotten about me. He stated that he would get back to me soon. 

After playing phone tag, he got in touch with me ar the beginning of the third week to let me know that they couldn't really tell if the damage was the or not in the video.  I explained to him again that the damage could not have occurred anywhere else due to nature of the damage.  Shane did not offer to repair the damage that his service personnel caused to my vehicle. 

Now, after playing for a Ford service package to take care of my vehicle, Shane's team is forcing me to lay for damaged they caused out of my own pocket. How dishonest can a car dealership be? I'm not sure, but Russell & Smith Ford is the absolute worst one I have dealt with.

2092,1747,01-Sep-18,"Anywhere else is better than this place. After my experience today, I will never come back. I had a corroded battery cable that needed to be replaced. I was prepared to spend quite a bit due to the fact that Ford engineers made the asinine decision to make it that you could not replace individual terminals on the cable. That was fine. Background info: 2014 with 21k miles. 

The average cost of a battery cable replacement should be around $300... maybe $350. I ended up paying a lot more than that. Labor costs are absolutely ridiculous but what is even more ridiculous is that parts are listed cheaper on the Russell and Smith Ford Parts page and they will not honor those prices. Trust me. I tried and even showed the ""service advisor"" who said Parts would not budge on the cost. Service advisor said he made up the difference on the cost of the part from subtracting from the cost of labor. If that was the case, labor would have been astronomial.

The part that I had replaced DLZ3-14300-D is listed as $146.29 but I was charged $267. Here is the real kicker, the MSRP List Price on their own website is $237.49 before their discount. 

They also recommended I buy a battery, which I do need. They quoted it as $150. Again, more expensive than their parts website. A BXT-65-750, 750 amp battery, is $116.44 on their website. I refused the battery and will purchase elsewhere. 

Check it out for yourselves. Type Russell Smith Ford Parts in google and look it up for yourselves. 

Russell & Smith Ford hosed me and will most likely hose you too. Learn from my mistake. Go anywhere else but here.

We knew the vehicle we wanted. We were initially pleased with our experience. After the test drive and we decided we wanted the van, everything started going downhill. 

The paperwork took much longer than it should have, in large part due to our salesman, Muhammed, who everyone repeatedly told us was new. We tried to be patient, everyone has to learn. It soon became obvious that Muhammed had no clue what he was doing. We were shuffled from one seating area to another. We finally completed the paperwork with someone else. 

We were then told that the van was being detailed. So we waited. Two hours later, after being told multiple times that it was almost finished, we were told that there was a mix up and the van was being fully detailed. Then we were told the van needed to pass the final inspection before they could release it. By this time, the garage was closing, so a man named Jim told us he would give us a loaner and that our van would be delivered to us Monday, February 27. 

By 1:00 p.m. Monday afternoon, we had heard nothing. I called 3 times, my husband called once. Finally, around 3:30, Muhammed called me back. I was told the van would be ready in about an hour and half. At 4:53 p.m., Muhammed called to tell me he was on his way to my office building with the van. 

After Muhammed left in the loaner car, I realized he had left the remote to a Lexus in my new van. I then pushed the overhead button to open the sunroof and the entire section of plastic and buttons fell down and just dangled. I realized that someone had broken the plastic surrounding the buttons in two places.

When we test the van, I pushed all the buttons. The overhead plastic was not broken. All the buttons worked. Nothing was broken. The sliding door on the driver side was not working properly and we were told they would fix it. The door is still not working. 

On Tuesday, my husband took the van back to the dealership to try and get them to fix what they broke. No one would even talk to him. He said people were literally running away from him.

I understand that you buy a used car as is. When we bought the car and signed the paperwork, we were happy with the condition it was in. I fully expected them to fix what they broke.

When they sent this it was several thousand more. I called and they said the truck was priced incorrectly and Allah was very unprofessional to say the least. I had to continually call and text Brandon the sales guy for pictures of the truck with very poor return communication. I texted him twice to confirm that truck was a short bed but he never replied, I then called and he said he was standing in front of the truck and that it is indeed a short bed. I fly from AZ to TX to get the truck and when I get there the truck is a LONG BED! After several hours of being pushed to the side as they help other customers I finally get a discussion. Daniel a manager acknowledges that he is positive that Brandon made a mistake. The made it very clear that they would not pay to fly me back home nor my flight expense to get it there to find that the truck was not what they had sold me on. The pictures they kept sending me were at terrible angles so you couldn't tell and that's why I kept asking to make sure. Keep in mind I just spent $560 on a ONE way plane ticket! So I was stuck making a decision if I should fly back home and have to have came out of pocket for over $1,000 or if I should just accept the truck not being what I wanted nor was told it was. I told them that I would like for them to take $1,000 off the price of the vehicle because that's what it would have cost them to fix their mistake ethically by paying for my flight out there and back because their salesperson misled me and gave me the wrong information which not only cost me hundreds of dollars to get there but also my time.

I towed my 2007 Ford Escape Hybrid to the dealership after the engine stalled in the middle  of the Interstate with a „Stop safely now“ sign on. Within a week they told me that I had to replace the DC/DC converter. I trusted them but luckily I bought an used part which saved me over $2000! That did not resolve the issue though.
They kept my vehicle for nearly two months w/o any resolution. I even provided them with a compiled list of error causes which I researched for hours on the internet. No success. Most of the time I had to call them to get an status update – what a terrible customer service! After five weeks I wrote an email to the regional manager in order to get Ford Motor Company involved (I asked for the provision of an experienced field technician  and a loaner). Both requests were denied by referring to an internal Ford policy which does not provide these services for vehicles older than 10y. Apparently, Ford is not able or willing to resolve security issues of their own vehicles – so much about their comittment to customers and hybrid technology. In the end, the dealership made me still pay nearly $1000 for labor and parts although the vehicle was not running! Scandalous! 
Brought the vehicle to an independent garage which diagnosed and fixed the issue (series of damaged wiring harness) within 48h for less than Gullo charged me. Also they confirmed my suspicion that the replacement of the DC/DC converter was unnecessary – the damaged wiring harness caused the error code and the DC DC converter not to work. Scandalous! I wrote them an email to ask for a refund but they just evaded by saying how much labor they have not charged me for.
Two lessons learned: 1) Ford Motor Company is not comitted to its vehicles once they are outside the warranty period and provided no support despite an obvious security issue and lack of repair progress at the dealership. This was the last Ford vehicle I have purchased! 
2) The Hybrid technicians at Gullo are unqualified, discouraged and inexperienced. I never felt appreciated, adequately adviced and supported by Gullo Ford – neither by their “certified“ technicians nor by their service manager and service advisors.

Even though we were assured we'd go ""to the front of the line"" since this was a purchase.  Gum still in the cup holder, dirt still in the door latches, engine compartment never washed at all.  There was a water leak that i informed them about.  Told them specifically to check the rear marker light.  They picked the truck up to address all of these issues.  Got the truck back and was told they couldn't detail it because of personal belongings in the truck.  We were never told to remove anything before they picked the truck up.  Couldn't even wash the engine compartment because there was personal items inside the cab.  Was also told ""no leak found""...I inspected the truck myself and the marker light is pulling away from the cab.  The headliner is now water stained.

Service Rep was lethargic in both keeping abreast of technician progress and contacting me on the correct phone number.requiring me to hitch a ride to the Dealer at 5:00 pm to get info on service progress.  The initial fault code for initiating service was still present when the truck was delivered to me the following day requiring return trip to Dealer.

2162,1822,27-Sep-19,"If you’re thinking about getting service done on you’re vehicle at this dealership, be prepared to get taken advantage of. To make a long story short, I drove my truck there expecting to just get a simple state inspection and was left without a vehicle for now over 70 days. They gave me the runaround about it needing a complete exploratory breakdown to fix whatever was preventing it to pass state inspection. Then proceeded to charge me $4,250.00 for their work and yet still unable to pass state inspection. I couldn’t imagine spending that much and still not have it inspected. So left it in their hands to get the necessary driving done (which i was told it needed in order for the computer to calculate it was ok for inspection.) In doing so, they had multiple people driving my truck around for well over 100 miles, god only knows doing what, and blew the engine. They now expect me to pay the $4,250.00 on top of over another $6,000.00 for a “ new” junk yard motor in order to fix my truck. So, over $10,000.00 now to get my truck back in running shape. All of this after just simply driving it there to get it inspected and be on my way. They now expect me to tow my truck home unless I agree to replace a motor they once claimed was fixed and totally repaired that they blew while driving it. This is a down right disgrace.

2165,1825,01-Aug-19,Purchased a New 450 KR super communicative until they had the sale. Had issues with the truck talked to the service guy they needed the tuck back. I told them I had to have back the next day since they were only measuring to see why the 5th wheel did nit fit. Service said no problem they should have back same day. the following day still had not heard back so 1 hr before they closed I started calling no one knew anything about the truck since he was not at work that day. had to go there find truck. Then a month goes by no contact. kept calling leaving messages no response. finally got someone to answer the phone and they started to track the people who knew after another 2 weeks nothing had to call that same person and push them more. Finally after 3 months they figured out the problem and it got fixed. During the process discovered the inverter did not work so when I dropped it off asked them to take care of it then. When I picked up the truck the inverter still did not work. Pointed it out while I was there they took it back and checked it out. Brought the truck back to me did not fix anything said it was working I tried to show them they just said oh well it works. 5 minutes after I left the tech tried the same thing in a different truck and well they called me to say they messed up there is a problem and would need the truck back to fix it. I called an left a message the next day to see if I could drop it off while I had time. Did not get a call back for another week  still have the same issue. ,1,34,0,0
2166,1826,24-Jul-19,"My entire dealing with the service department at Southwest Ford In Hudson Oaks was the worst experience I have had with a car dealership. 

I called at 0700 in the morning to schedule an appointment to have my vehicle serviced. They told me they had an open appointment 0900. This was the first lie I was told. I dropped my vehicle off by 0730 and was told I would be called as soon as they found the problem. At 1530 I still had not heard from them, so I decided to call. My rep for the dealership was not available so I left a message asking for a call back with an update on my vehicle. After an hour and still no return call I called a second time. Once again I get voicemail. I leave a second message to get an update on my vehicle. Still no return call. So two hours after my first call and them having my vehicle for 8 1/2 hours I make my third call. Surprise I get voicemail again. So I left my third message. About five minutes later I get a return call from my service rep. He tells me they haven’t had time to look at my vehicle but it will be looked at first thing tomorrow morning. I will say I was mad and asked why do I need to schedule for an appointment if they don’t keep them. My service rep told me “it’s a third party company that schedules these appointments. They have no idea how busy we are or how long things take. So they cram as many appointments in as they can. He said my issues happens all the time.”  

So now it’s so late I don’t have time to pick it up and take it anywhere else that night. Since he promised it would be looked at first thing in the morning I left the vehicle there (my second mistake and their second lie). So once I again I don’t hear back from my service rep all morning. So at 1230 I call and surprise he actually answered the phone. He told me they were still looking at it and that’s all he knew. Know I usually work on my own vehicles but due to my busy work schedule and it being 100 degrees outside I took it to get repaired. So I know a fair amount about vehicles. The issue that I took my vehicle in for should not take a professional mechanic over an hour maybe two at the most to figure out. So once again I’m guessing they lied and didn’t start first thing in the morning. 

The service rep calls me back at 1430 and tells me they found the problem. He makes excuses of how hard it was to figure out and that why it took all day. I don’t question him and just agree. He then tells me they don’t have the part in stock and due to the late hour it will be tomorrow before they can get it. So now my vehicle will be there three days. Finally he tells my how much my total bill will be. A little over $700 (last and final lie). I tell him go ahead and fix it. 

So day three mid afternoon I miss his call and get a voicemail my vehicle is ready. Soon after I get a second and a third call from him. At this point I’m thinking wow you can’t call me back when you are not doing what you said you were. But man once my vehicle is done and you are ready for payment you have all the time to call me. 

So I go to pickup my vehicle. When I walk in my service rep is standing there talking to another customer. I stand there several minutes without him ever saying a word to me. After they just talk about a lot of nothing he finally greets me. He goes and gets my paperwork/ bill. The total was $75 more than what he told me the day before. At this point I’m done with them and just pay it without even saying a word (my fault for not speaking up).  

So he pulls my car around. As he is getting out and handing my keys, he ask hey would you like me to wash it real fast. I’m thinking maybe that should have been done before you called me to pick it up or before you drove it around. I tell him no thank you. He goes well anytime you want one stop by and ask for me. At this point I say ok and drive off. 

So if you made it this far I’m guessing you know I’ll never go back even for a free car wash. ",1,34,0,0

2187,1847,14-Apr-17,"I went in to purchase a new ford on 04/08/2017. I walked around on the lot for about 30 minutes before I just had to ask for a salesman. Then I picked out a vehicle and began to put the numbers together. 1st, they offered me $1,000 dollars less on a rebate than Ford was giving. 2nd, I told them I did not want the rebate I wanted to finance through Ford Credit and get the 0% interest for 66 months. the salesman came back to me and stated Ford does not have 0% financing on this vehicle. okay at this point I admit I should have walked out of this dealership, but instead I had him go to the Ford website and the salesman pulled up the Ford incentives and looked at me and stated see they do not have that incentive. I looked at him and said see the 2 tabs on the screen to the right, click on the middle tab and there it was a full page on the 0% for 66 months. 3rd, the salesman went back to the manager and returned and had the audacity to state, THAT IS NOT REALLY 0% FINANCING, THAT IS A FLEX BUY. I must have had stupid stamped on my forehead, I worked for Ford Dealerships for 20 years and I know what a flex buy is and this ford offer that Southwest Ford in Weatherford, Texas was refusing to honor and attempt to scam me into another financing scheme was pitiful. 4th, I know I am still there, just can't wait to see the next scam the pull out, so the salesman goes back to his manager and finally agrees to the 0% financing that was always in BIG BOLD print for Ford, But now the trade in value was dropped several thousand dollars, okay now I am walking out the door. Do not take my experience at the dealer lightly, their dishonesty with me was deliberate and they had no intention of honoring the Ford Financing. As I stated I was in the business for over 20 years and I understand why they were doing what they were doing and it was certainly not for the benefit or well being of their customers.

2203,1866,29-Mar-18,"I have a 2013 Chevrolet Suburban that has a second water leak on a body seam leaking into the passengers floorboard. To back up a little bit this car replaced a 2010 Tahoe that had a roof that was leaking and they were going to have to replace the roof on the car. So we got the suburban thinking that the Tahoe was just a lemon and this one would be better. Well back to the leaking car. I took the car to the dealership and was told that it was probably leaking around the windshield that had been replaced. So I made an appointment with the body shop and they tested the windshield and found no leaks. A couple of weeks later I am back at the dealership and was told that it was going to cost around $300.00 to diagnose the problem. I was called later and told it was a body seam leaking and that it was not covered. I asked if I could come take pictures ( they would not let me take pictures of the first leak ). I asked if I could come take pictures and I was told that they hadn't taken the car apart yet but when they did I could take pictures. When I got there to take pictures I was told it was leaking behind a blob of caulking that GM smears on the seams. I made the comment that any normal person could see that if the blob of caulking would have been smeared in the area of the leak it would not have leaked. I asked them how they would repair the leak and the answer was to put some more caulking in the area behind the original blob of caulking. So in other words where the other caulking should have been. Their answer was always the same, I don't know.  I have a case on this problem with GM and the service department  will not mention to them that if the caulking would have smeared in the area that was leaking  it may have never leaked. All they would mention to them was the car had been in an accident in which the body shop told me there was no damage in that area.  They also told GM that it may have been cause by the way I drive, weather conditions, or the flexing of the vehicle that cracks the body sealant causing it to separate  ( I did not see any cracks or separation ). I went back to the dealership and told them I needed documentation as to what caused it to leak and also that something stating that the door gasket and wires running along the threshold of the door had been under water because of the water leak and I was told I had all of the documentation on my invoice I was going to get. All it said was where body seam was leaking  and that it was fixed.  I was told that the corporate person was just giving me the run around.

2230,1893,08-Feb-18,"A few years ago, we changed from general automotive repair facilities in Weatherford to Jerry's.  At first, we found the experience a welcomed change.  We appreciated our initial service writer, Brad Minot, with whom we developed a long-standing relationship, the overall customer service, loaner vehicles, etc.  However, this is now the second time recently I've had maintenance done at Jerry's only to bring the car home to immediately encounter car trouble.  A few months ago, we brought our suburban in for some work and an oil change.  During the oil change, allegedly all fluids were checked and topped-off.  However, shortly thereafter, the transmission would not shift appropriately.  I pulled the transmission fluid dipstick only to find there was no fluid on the dipstick.  I'm not exactly sure how ""all fluids were checked and filled"" yet there was no fluid on the dipstick.  Now, we just picked up our suburban again yesterday after having some more repair work done, which included having Jerry's perform a state inspection.  Somehow, it passed inspection but suddenly has a ""check engine"" light being displayed, and the engine is running roughly and missing.  This wasn't happening prior to bringing it to Jerry's.  The appearance is, at best, that poor service and lack of QA is becoming rampant at Jerry's; worse, is that malicious acts are being done to incur more maintenance in order to generate additional revenue.  I hope these are isolated and unfortunate coincidences, but the experience has been extremely frustrating.  My family has purchased vehicles from Jerry's dating back to my grandparents.  Regrettably, I think we're being forced to begin doing business elsewhere.

111,1894,03-Mar-17,"I contacted this dealership through their website back around early-mid February. I found a truck that would eat a lot of the negative I had going in, and granted I knew it wasn't ""free"" money, but I wanted out of my deal and this was a way to accomplish that. Michael contacted me through email fairly quickly (pretty sure it was an automated email), but I was contacted. I told him what I had going on, and I know my particular situation is a car salesman's nightmare, but he said he would take a look at it. I then didn't hear from him for a little over a week, and he said apologized for the miscommunication and that he had to find the right truck. Which, confused me because I thought we already had, either way, no big deal, moving along. So, he sends me a link to one via email that I would go check out the next day. That particular truck sold the night we spoke, so the next day when I got out there, he only had two with a particular bonus tag attached. Michael was nice, straight forward about it, and that we'd need to find a different truck. He located one, which I had pulled up on my phone, but couldn't seem to find it in his system. After some digging, he located the keys, but then it was on to actually find it. We drove around for probably about 20 or so minutes before he actually found it. I'll be honest, I'm not sure how many salesmen that see my kind of deal, would drive around for 20 minutes to find a vehicle, so this was nice. Anyways, found the truck, I wasn't crazy about the color, so we spoke for a bit and I told him I'd think about it. That night, I wrote him an email telling him I had thought about it and would like to go ahead. He contacted me around 10am the next day and we spoke for a little, and had asked me to do a credit app, I agreed that was a way to move forward. After finishing the credit app, he called to tell me the payment and that he had an approval. I was first a little confused, because it was $40 more a month then what we had spoken about the night before, and not only $40 more a month, it also went from a 75 to an 84 month term. I asked him the details around it, why did it change, what was the interest rate they were basing those numbers on, etc. He stated that the dealership doesn't give him that information (if this is true, what the xxxx guys? How can a customer make an informative decision with his salesman if you can't even provide him the pertinent details). So, I said that doesn't make any sense, but sure, if you could have them call me, that would be great. Four or so hours passed, no call, so I called him. He stated he had gotten busy, and that I would hear from him that night, or early the next day. I didn't hear from him that night, and the next morning by 11am (could have been 10:30ish, not sure) still no word. So I texted him, it took a while, but then I got a text back; ""Well, the truck sold this morning."" Now, I'm a little annoyed at this point. It was a simple request, I didn't ask for anything remotely complex. I use Credit Karma to review my information each week/month and wouldn't ya know it, they reflect that the dealership hit my credit with 8 different banks. Yes, that's the number that comes after 7. I call him to figure it out, he's busy. So, I called the dealership and asked for the manager. Spoke with the manager (I think it was Jeff, I can't remember, he also said he would call me back, never did), and Michael had stated to him that he didn't have a ""commitment"" from me. Commitment, by definition, is being ""dedicated to a activity"". I don't know guys, I think a lot of people would agree that having you run my information for a particular truck to be a ""dedication"" to an activity. Here's what I think. I think Michael screwed up. I think he either sold it to a customer who he had face to face, because that was easier to do, or he took his eye off the ball and screwed up. I spoke to him later that day, and he admitted he was at fault, but stated that he couldn't do much because that was a truck with the most rebates. He did say, which made me chuckle, that he can't do much when there are ""64 employee's at the dealership"". Yeah, but you can, you could have ensured that finance called me sooner, rather than never. You could have placed the vehicle in an area and tagged it ""pending"". You could have done, what other dealerships do all of the time. It's just not a good look to run the credit (8 times, remember, that's the one that comes after 7) of a customer on a particular vehicle, and then sell said vehicle without ever informing the customer how they could ensure that wouldn't happen (e.g., deposit). 

Was Michael nice? Sure. But nice won't make the inquiries on my credit fall off. Michael did call and leave a VM two days ago, after March rebates had hit, and gave me details on a truck he found stating ""the payment is higher, but if you can swing it, it's a nice truck"".  I have filed a complaint with the BBB, for the simple fact that you cannot, nor should you, run someones credit in such a irresponsible manner. I have not (as of yet) filed a complaint with the Texas AG's office (still contemplating that). Maybe the employees need better training, maybe a different career path. Either way, this was a different experience than what I'm used to and for someone with over 14 years experience in the industry AND a dealership with such a high rating, unacceptable. ",1,36,1,0

113,1918,10-Apr-18,"I made two trips to this dealership to buy a Yukon XL.  First trip (on a Friday), salesman A (Mo) took all my information down and valued my trade in and said he was gonna call and email me information on Monday which I thought was weird because he didn't even seem like he wanted to make a sale that day.  
A week goes by and I never hear from him so I sent another internet request for information.  After getting a call from salesman B (James), we arranged an appointment to check out two trucks that had the exterior/interior color combination I wanted.  I came back into Westpoint GMC on a Saturday.  Car #1 was a demo car being driven by one of the managers as a daily driver that had almost 4,000 miles but the salesman kept insisting was new because it was never titled.  Car #2 was brand new with no miles.  Keep in mind these are the exact same trucks with the only thing differing between the two was bench seat vs. bucket seat second row.  
So we walk inside to work out some numbers on both trucks and the salesman came back and said the demo truck was gonna be my best deal.  He never even gave me any option to talk about the truck with 0 miles.  James, the salesman, low-balled the heck out of me on my trade-in and quoted me an outrageous price on the demo truck with almost 4,000 miles.  I was immediately turned off and showed him paperwork from other offers I got.  He went to the back and immediately came back and said they could give me $8000 more for my trade-in and drop the price a couple thousand--a difference of almost $10,000 just like that.  I wanted a breakdown of the numbers and even at the offer they just gave me, something didn't seem right about it.  I did the math (very generously in their favor might I add) on my own and even showed James the salesman the ""out the door"" price it should have been given the information he just presented me because I wanted to know where the extra $5,000ish was coming from.  He stumbled a bit because he couldn't give me a straight answer.  
At that point, I asked for my keys back and left Westpoint, purchased my vehicle same day at another dealership, and never looked back.
I don't claim to be an expert on selling cars, but Westpoint GMC committed every salesman error in the book including, but not limited to:  they didn't read the needs of the customer and just assumed I was an idiot when I walked in, they were not very knowledgeable about the product they were selling, and most importantly, they did not attempt at any time to seem like they were being truthful and forthcoming while doing business.
These two visits to Westpoint GMC is the reason most people dread the car-buying experience.  I usually don't write reviews and rather let people make their own opinions on a business, but I'm actually making it a point steer people away from Westpoint GMC so they don't have experience I had.",1,37,1,0

When we came in to sign the paperwork on Monday we were presented with a price $5,000 higher than originally promised! This is not a joke or a misrepresentation. This extreme withdrawal tactic is criminal and demonstrated the lack of integrity and fair dealing of this dealer's management. We were offended and appalled by their manipulative tactics.

To back up a little bit this car replaced a 2010 Tahoe that had a roof that was leaking and they were going to have to replace the roof on the car. So we got the suburban thinking that the Tahoe was just a lemon and this one would be better. Well back to the leaking car. I took the car to the dealership and was told that it was probably leaking around the windshield that had been replaced. So I made an appointment with the body shop and they tested the windshield and found no leaks. A couple of weeks later I am back at the dealership and was told that it was going to cost around $300.00 to diagnose the problem. I was called later and told it was a body seam leaking and that it was not covered. I asked if I could come take pictures ( they would not let me take pictures of the first leak ). I asked if I could come take pictures and I was told that they hadn't taken the car apart yet but when they did I could take pictures. When I got there to take pictures I was told it was leaking behind a blob of caulking that GM smears on the seams. I made the comment that any normal person could see that if the blob of caulking would have been smeared in the area of the leak it would not have leaked. I asked them how they would repair the leak and the answer was to put some more caulking in the area behind the original blob of caulking. So in other words where the other caulking should have been. Their answer was always the same, I don't know.  I have a case on this problem with GM and the service department  will not mention to them that if the caulking would have smeared in the area that was leaking  it may have never leaked. All they would mention to them was the car had been in an accident in which the body shop told me there was no damage in that area.  They also told GM that it may have been cause by the way I drive, weather conditions, or the flexing of the vehicle that cracks the body sealant causing it to separate  ( I did not see any cracks or separation ). I went back to the dealership and told them I needed documentation as to what caused it to leak and also that something stating that the door gasket and wires running along the threshold of the door had been under water because of the water leak and I was told I had all of the documentation on my invoice I was going to get. All it said was where body seam was leaking  and that it was fixed.  I was told that the corporate person was just giving me the run around.

2287,1962,13-Dec-19,"Most people have never heard of rail dust. We hadn’t either, until three months after our vehicle purchase. And let me tell you, this has been a nightmare.

We purchased our new Honda Pilot this past summer and after a thorough hand wash, discovered small yellow/rust colored specks ALL OVER the vehicle. After some searching on Google, I was pretty sure, our car was covered in what’s called “rail dust”. If a vehicle is transported by train or sits by tracks, there’s a fine dust that can get into the paint. This dust is corrosive and over time, it rusts away at the vehicles paint. We went over the car VERY carefully at purchase, and it seems that it took several months for the rail dust to rust, to the point to where it could be seen.

As you can imagine, we were horrified, that our brand new $40,000 car was essentially covered in “rust”. First Texas was initially helpful and offered to do something called clay barring. This is supposed to remove the rail dust. After they had the vehicle for about a week to clay bar it, we were called, told the vehicle looked like new, and to come pick it up. It only took about 5 minutes to see, the car was STILL covered in rail dust. So, either they did a POOR job at inspecting the car, or they flat out lied to us. Either way, the car did NOT look “new” again. Okay, we gave them another shot. This time, they said the vehicle had to be taken apart and throughly went over. We were NOT happy with a brand new vehicle being disassembled OUTSIDE of the factory when it was only months old, but we felt like we had no other choice. We left the car there for about three weeks, picked it up...and guess what.. Not only was there STILL rail dust on the car, seals were put back improperly, the rear doors now are not fully aligned properly, AND they put a scratch on a door and tried to cover it up with touch up paint!!!! The trim (that also had rust), we were told was replaced, yet there are still pieces of trim that have rust. We now have a vehicle in WORSE condition then it was before we took it to the dealer. 

We are currently speaking with lawyers and the GM. Honda corporate is of NO HELP, as dealerships are privately owned, and they wash their hands of what happens at the dealerships. Last time we spoke with the GM, he offered to swap it out with another vehicle...but it would cost us $9,000. Yep, THIS IS INSANITY folks. 

Most recently, we had a professional come to look at the car. He was able to get out a couple of spots they missed and said, they must have not been thorough. He was also SHOCKED, when I told him the car was taken apart. He saw no need for that and was flabbergasted when I showed him the damage they had done to our vehicle.

After two in person visits to the service department, it is confirmed they will not replace it and I am completely out of luck. 

This was a brand new OEM replacement starter that should have lasted a decade and barely lasted a year.  Fair play to First Honda since the 1 year warranty was technically honored by them, I guess.

Having said that, there really is no benefit at all to go to this dealership for a service repair because of the high cost and this kind of customer treatment.  

I would like to point out 1 week after they fixed the starter in September, I had to get it towed back to the dealership because they did not fasten the wiring harness tight enough.  First Honda comped the cost of the towing.

I have spent like $4,000 with First Honda and I was considering getting a CR-V for my wife. First Honda has lost a customer for life and I will go out of my way to not recommend the First Honda dealership in the future.",1,39,0,0

Took my car at this place after a recommendation from of tiles rotation from my local Honda dealer in Frisco, TX that was going to cost me $19 to do.  I purchased tires at this place last year and though I could get them do the tile rotation when I returned to Austin. Dropped the car in and got a call back from the service that I need a wheel alignment, new brake and new brake fluid that was going to cost me $600.  I decided not to proceed with the work and wanted to seek an advice from my local Honda Dealer in Frisco.  I took my car and drove it back in worse condition that it was when I brought it in. Somehow now I needed a wheel alignment that I did not need when I brought the car in.  Took the car back to my local dealer for a full tires and break checkup.  I was told none of the recommendation from First Texas Honda was due at this time because everything was working fine as per they previous diagnostics only this time (somehow) I now need the wheel alignment.   Ended up paying $57 for the wheel alignment instead of $130 that First Texas Honda wanted to charge me.  This place seems to recommending replacement of parts and services that still fully working and If you turned then down when they have your car.. you may not know what will happened to your car.

2297,1972,23-Oct-18,"Jay Jenks and Aaron Yiu personally examined my car just two weeks after I bought it when I was having problems with the defroster and lots of squeaking with my brakes and tires. The handle of the car wasn’t great- it’s a 2013 Toyota Camry with only 44K miles on it, but I wasn’t sure about the tires. They seemed worn and were making a lot of noise and would skid in wet weather.

Jay fully inspected my car and admitted to me afterwards that the tires should have been replaced prior to me having been sold the car- I really appreciated his transparency and honesty. I could tell he was saying what he believed. Same with Aaron- both standup guys who are clearly in the business of customer service.

Unfortunately, his bosses in First Texas Honda’s service department saw it differently, even tho they didn’t examine the car. They looked at the service report, decided that the measurements were within Texas’ “minimal acceptable guidelines” markers (exact verbiage from Cody Penna- the service manager in an email to me), and told me flat out that they would not replace my tires and patronizingly told me that I could purchase new tires from them and that they’d be “happy to help.” What a joke- this place claims to be “where we put you first” but once you buy a car from them, forget about that. Extremely disappointed with my experience here, and I will never again take my car in for service here or buy or recommend that anyone else buys a car here. Too big to care. Unfortunate because I really do believe that Jay Jenks is a standup guy who did the right thing- shame the ppl he works with are penny wise and pound foolish and care about technicalities and minimal standards over service! Appreciate you, Jay and Aaron!

I respect Cody as a person and am sure he’s a nice guy (I’ve never actually met him or worked with him, he just made all the decisions from a sheet of paper), but his customer service abilities leave much to be desired. He didn’t even examine my car yet because he’s the service manager, decides that what I was told was “misinformation” and that it needed to be “clarified” when I know what I was told by the ppl who actually inspected the car. Using language like “minimal guidelines” and other technical terms to get you off the hook is not something customers are interested in hearing about- like I said, penny wise and pound foolish because you lost a customer and I sincerely suggest that ppl shop for their cars elsewhere if they want decent service post purchase.",1,39,0,0

I was told by the sales manager that if I leased a new vehicle, that tax would be taken care of...that i would simply turn in my 14 and get a 17.  Ok.  Let me think about it. Sure, I hate the DMV and I have a good paying job, why not?  Also, I was told by my sales guy that while the car was under Honda's name, I wouldn't have to pay the toll.  

Both of these things are lies.

A few months after I bought the car, I got a bill from TXtag saying I owed about $60.  When I contacted my sales agent, he was confused.  Fine, I will pay it off.  Probably won't go to that guy again.

BUT THEN, I received a letter from Honda this week saying I owe back-taxes on my 14 - THE EXACT THING THAT I WAS TOLD I WOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY IF I LEASED A NEW CAR!!  Both of these cannot be a misunderstanding on my end.

Billy might be right though, I may have expected a typical employee of Honda (which is a brand I love... or loved) to have compromised or to have behaved with more integrity, but I guess it was naive of me to expect a sale manager that ""accidentally"" posts low mileage which ""accidentally"" accrues to his favor and only reveals the information 1-minute after the price negotiation is finished to have compromised.",1,40,0,0

DO NOT COME HERE. FOR ANYTHING.

I brought my 2002 Honda CRV in because it was having issues starting. They charged me the diagnostic fee, I said ok, they said they'd figure out what was wrong with it.

It took them four days to figure out what was wrong with it. Up to this point, I'm still fine. Maybe it was something really complicated, who knows. So the service rep calls me back and quotes me at 900$ to replace the starter, and then says oh, you also need all of this other extra stuff (as dealerships often do). I said oh, that's a whole lot, please let me call you back soon. 

I called my family mechanic, who quoted me for 250$ less, and decided I would take my car to him. I called the dealership back within 15 minutes, no answer. Called again, no answer, so I left a voicemail saying hey, please don't do anything to my car, I'll be by to pick it up tomorrow after I get off of work.

The next day, I got a call from the service rep saying they went ahead and replaced the starter, and my total would be 980$. Of course, I was pissed, because I had never said yes, please fix my starter. When I came in to pick up my car, this customer rep tried to say TO MY FACE that I authorized the work. I demanded he bring up the audio recording of our phone convo (because you know they have to record everything) where I approved the work, and he shrank back and knocked 200$ off my price. I should have just refused to pay and taken my car back at this point, because THIS IS WHERE IT GETS WORSE.

I got back in my car, turned it on, and my SRS light was on. It had never been on before, not until I took it to the dealership, so I immediately turned around, walked back in and said, ""........Why is my SRS light on? If y'all messed up something else in my car, you need to fix it."", to which I was responded with ""Well, we can run a diagnostic on it, but it will cost"" at which point I just walked out.

Fast forward to today, when I took my CRV to the Clear Lake dealership to have the SRS light looked at. They quoted me TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS to fix the damage this dealership did to my car. I can't even begin to explain in English words how upset I am right now at this dealership. Probably the worst experience I've ever had paying for anything, ever, and then they ruined my car (for those of you that don't know, they basically killed my car's safety system, so the airbags will not deploy if somebody hits me). I can't afford to get a new car right now (because I just paid y'all at Gillman 900$), I can't afford to fix my car's airbags, and my car inspection is due at the end of this month. 

Tl,Dr;
I took my car to Gilllman to be looked at, they kept it for a week, and charged me an exorbitant amount to break my airbags while doing work I hadn't authorized, so now I drive a deathtrap that I can't make street legal, and if I get pulled over, I'll get arrested.

When I researched what they recommended, I couldn't believe the prices they were charging.  I watched someone on youtube replace the same solenoid in less than 20 minutes and the part costs around $70.  It's one thing that they charge $145 per hour shop rate.  But to think that they wonted $537 was over the top.  Carbon Cleaning, who has heard of this.  I bought a Honda because of the reliability.  Carbon Cleaning, I consider this a total scam and hope everyone looks out for this, I have had cars that have gone over 200,000 miles and no one every recommended Carbon Cleaning!

Picked up the car and they charged me a $145 diagnostic fee.  Really, if they wanted to keep me as a loyal customer, they would tell me what is wrong with my vehicle and help me fix it a reasonable price.  I can go to any parts store and they'll run a diagnostic test for FREE.  

Worst yet, I drove off their lot and there is not check engine light on.  Yes, they most likely reset the light, but is has been a long  weekend running the vehicle and no check light.  Was it a fluke, did they even check the solenoid to see if it was faulty?

In my opinion, BAD, BAD customer service philosophy.  Treat people fare and honestly and they will stay will you forever.  Treat them poorly, leaving someone with the feeling of being taken advantage of, not only will you loose their business, they will tell as many other people of your failures.

Gillman Honda will NEVER earn my business.  I will drive or trailer my HONDA ODYSSEY to another Honda dealer and explain to them exactly why before they work on my vehicle.  Hopefully all Honda Dealers aren't the same.

After checking my car, he contacted me and said they need to replace new A/C compressor but unfortunately that part is out of stock. He said he didn't know how long I have to wait for that part is shipped. 
Two days later, he called me and said it will take one week to ship. After a week sweating without A/C, he hadn't contacted me so I called him and asked about it, he didn't even apologize but also said that I gotta wait much longer and do not know how long. While I bought my car brand new 2017 from them, there is no ways a large dealer like this take forever to ship A/C compressor. Then, I decided to go to other dealers to get my car fixed. 
Went to Spring Branch dealer, dropped off my car early from morning and got it done completely in one day.

2352,2039,23-Jun-19,"I am a disgruntled potential customer that would like to share my experience today at your dealership. I hope this gets escalated so that it can be corrected. Today, my mom and I were in the market for an accord. After visiting Big Star and Clearlake, Clearlake gave me a great deal, everything was lined up, except one thing- they did not have the car in stock. They would have to do a trade, and it would be ready for pick up on Tuesday. So I decided to call your dealership for a quote and availability. Nick answered, said the car is in stock, gave me a solid deal: beat Clearlake by $100 and will match the special interest rate, pending credit. At the time, my mom was weary of visiting two dealerships so she did not want to visit a 3rd. So she did the online credit app, sent me in to iron out all the numbers, and went to work. If the numbers were good, she would come in to sign. 

When arrived, I was greeted by Nam Nguyen, friendly guy, who helped me. The deal was made. Then we went to finance. I was initially helped by Matt. After he did some crunching, he told me the interest rate would be over 5%. I questioned it, I was told that it would be 2.9% special rate, and my mom’s credit was over 800, it should qualify for it. He explained that with special pricing, I cannot receive special interest. I stated that’s not what I was quoted before I came in. He then stepped out of the office, and when he returned, he told me Javier will help me. Confused on why I’m being passed around. Javier asked me my age, and told me in order to buy the car, I have to be on the loan as well. I told him I do not want to be on the loan, my mom’s credit and income should be enough. He then advised me that since the car is for me, I have to be on the loan or else it’ll be considered a straw purchase, and that’s illegal. I questioned it, so how is it possible that parents buy cars for their kids to go to college, or when people buy cars as a gift. Father’s Day, Mother’s day, anniversary, Christmas, whatever the reason shall be. His reply, “only if they are under 18”. It still didn’t make sense but I responded, “I never heard of straw purchasing, I just learned something new. But regardless, I’m not under 18, and if I have to be on the loan, then it’s a deal breaker, I guess we won’t buy today” His reply, “if you don’t buy the car from us today, I will call all the banks and tell them you’re doing a straw purchase, blocking you from buying it somewhere else”. At that moment, I took it as a threat, strong arming me, forcing me to apply by his rules or else. Is that how Gillman treats their customers? Angry, I walked out his office. Of course he tried to stop me, and said he’s willing to make a deal. I was too angry to hear what “deal” he had to offer, so I left. We have purchased many cars throughout the years, but never once have we been treated this way. It’s very frustrating. If your dealership considers it a straw purchase and cannot sell, then so be it. But is threatening a customer apart of the process, is it necessary? I just want to share my experience, but I also hope someone can explain what just happened. Thank you for your time, I look forward to hearing back. ",1,41,0,1
2353,2040,14-Jun-19,"There is a reason why this dealership has the lowest rating in Houston. I paid $135 to get a diagnostic test, which they then recommended some costly repairs. The $135 diagnostic test goes toward the repair so you can always expect a costly, unreasonable repair. I had asked for an explanation on what needed to be changed out and the salesman pretty much told me everything I wanted to hear, to get me to agree to the repair. To avoid any miscommunication, I had him look up pictures of the pipe set on the internet and also show me fuel injectors in person, so I knew exactly what was going to be replaced. Once the ""repairs"" were done, I opened up the hood to verify the repairs and EVERYTHING WAS EXACTLY THE SAME AS IT WAS BEFORE THE REPAIR. The Service Manager gave me an explanation of the invoice. It turns out the salesman explanation on the repairs were inaccurate. It was truly a deceptive sales practice because everything prior to the invoice was just a verbal agreement. The invoice did not reflect what the salesman told me was going to be replaced.

Lessons to be learned at dealerships:
1. Avoid dealerships with low ratings. This dealership has the lowest rating in Houston.

2. Get what is going to be repaired in writing, before agreeing to the repair. Make them be as specific as possible or else they can change and charge whatever they want on the invoice.

3. Ask to get the old parts that were replaced. This is to verify that they did the replacement and not just did some quick repair.

4. Open up your hood and verify that they changed the parts as indicated in the bid.

I called several times for progress but no response so i went directly to there location, they said it will take some more time and they will update me by next day. I said ok and came back. next day james called me and said after diagnosis, they said A/C control unit has to be replaced and it will cost up to $1200, I just said no i will come and pick up. I went there and paid $450 and asked james to write down part number he written it on the invoice. later I bought that part in online store for $50 and replaced it but still A/C not working. I called james and asked is it a genuine reason he said his mechanic conformed it is the only problem, so I returned the part I bought in online. later I verified some of A/C circuit diagram and bypassed relay, my car compressor clutch engaged and when i checked R134a it was low, I filled it and put the relay back to its place and checked, that's it my car A/C worked normally. I didn't replaced any parts. The climate  control system works fine, If i agreed with them I might loose $1200 for false repair. But any how I lost $450 for their wrong diagnosis and lot of time.

2360,2048,16-Feb-19,"I enquired online to Gillman Honda Southwest about a new 2018 CR-V Touring, and received a response very quickly telling me they had  new 2018s available, they had them on their website, and in the color I wanted, giving me a quote which was acceptable to me. I was ready to buy it.
I received multiple emails from Gillman's edealer.hub February 8, 12, 13, and 15, 2019, still confirming they had the new 2018 CR-V Touring.
Somewhere in the middle of this I received an email from General Manager Daryl Waterwall asking me to call him, which I did. Mr Waterwall said he wanted to help me personally since we have bought previous Hondas from Gillman. He also said they didn't have 2018 but he would give me the same deal on a 2019 since I had been given wrong information.He also said he wanted to personally make sure we got in and out quickly.I told Mr Waterwall that my husband might also trade in his Honda Pilot.
I continued to receive emails from Gillman Southwest ehub about the new 2018 CR-Vs.including yesterday.
Today we went to Gillman Southwest for a 2:00 PM appointment I had verified with Mr. Waterwall. 
We were handed down from person to person to person, and told that they had seen the offers that had been emailed to me on the new 2018 CR-V Touring,, but they didn't have any. Yesterday I had received yet another email on the 2018 CR-V Touring and asking if I was coming in today for my appointment. I responded yes.
The person we ended up with was Mike, a very nice young man who had been given the job of selling me a 2019 CR-V and diffusing the bait and switch over the 2018. Mike said they were aware of the emails I was receiving from their dealership from the internet person but it was all a mistake. We asked where the internet hub people worked from and he told us right in the same building.
If Gillman Honda and Daryl Waterwall knew that I was continuing to be contacted by the internet person with erroneous information, why does it still go on? This is ridiculous, and our promise from Mr. Waterwall that we would be in and out quickly was also false. I had decided I would go ahead and get the 2019 CR-V that I drove, but the price haggle was ridiculous, and certainly not in line with ""giving me the same deal"". By now we had been at the dealership 3 hours and were taken to ""financing"" which was full of people. At this point we decided to go, and did inform Mike who in turn informed ""his boss"". Never again, the last car I am buying from Gillman is the one I drove in there today. This is a really bad way to do business. I feel badly for Mike, he was tasked with selling me a 2019 CR-V Touring, which is not what I wanted, and he was certainly not supported by Gillman's management team in this effort. I feel that Gillman's management team threw Mike and me both to the run around.
Even today, 2/17/2019 Gillman Honda Southwest website is still showing 2018 CR-V Touring available. If they can't take care of their business they certainly will not get mine.",1,41,0,0
2361,2049,15-Jan-19,"Went there for an oil change. Took me 3 hours... When driving on freeway going back home heard something rubbing against the road. Came to find out there is a tray under the engine it was hanging all the way to the ground and rubbing against the road. Called the dealership and they said do come back and they will fix it. Went back had to wait 3 hrs again and they put a new engine tray. Went to different place after few months  for oil change of coarse and before even they touched my car they showed me what Gillman honda did. Gillman honda had put all kinda different junk screws and clips to hold that tray up for the engine, not the honda OEM parts.... Can u imagine that spending all the money and time Just for peace of mind that they will do the job right and put OEM parts but instead they just mixed and matched and put whatever screws and clips they could find from junk to put the tray up. 
I got the oil change done from that place and than came back and brought the whole issue with service director Kelly. At first Called her so many times and left voice mails and Called her assistant also but no response. Finally Kelly (service director) calls and I was shocked by the way her attitude and customer sercive skills are. She really thought it wasnt a big deal. I dont care about anything but my time and safety for my family is very  very important. I m paying extra bucks so I can get that peace of mind and good customer service, and if my wife is on the road with my baby I m ok that the car is gonna be fine. 
She said to bring the car back and if that was the case where they messed up and if I was telling the truth (lol) she will take care of me (9 hrs waste of time) as They messed up my car. They messed up my car, mess up after mess up. And than I took my car back to honda Gillman. I requested manager to show me what is going on with my car. He showed me their mess up what They did and admitted their fault. He took all the after market screws and clips from the car and brought all OEM parts and put them on. I had to catch them for them to correct their mistake. NOW IF SOMETHING WAS INSIDE THE ENGINE I WOULD HAVE NEVER FOUND THAT.

I had a very bad experience at this honda dealership.  I live 45 minutes away from dealership and because of their fault I wasted 9 hrs of my time altogether and paid them What they asked for and in return Kelly had nothing to say... No apology or anything . She shouldnt be even a cashier at any place for the customer service skills she has to offer and She is a director of a place like this. Than imagine people working under her dont even care to do their jobs right. 

Will never go there again as they put CHEAP and after market parts in the cars to save their money and not putting their customers lives under serious safety issues. People have babies and kids and families so please take this advice and dont go their again. Honda Katy I have never heard anything bad about them. At least they put good and OEM parts and haven't heard anything in regards to this issue what I had to face with honda Gillman. 
Honda of Katy very nice and respectful people. Very satisfied with and very caring. If u want to save ur time and have peace of mind when ur family or kids drive the car and that the parts in ur car are actually original parts not the junk parts. DONT GO TO GILLMAN GO TO HONDA KATY IF U WANT TO BE HAPPY AND IF WANNA TRUST CAR WITH THE FAMILY.

127,2050,05-Dec-18,"I had a pretty nasty experience when I took my truck for a 100k service.  I have taken my truck here for oil change and the estimate given by the service advisor was around $1100.  Day before the appointment I called the same advisor and was told
That it would be another $300 in addition to the package that was recommended for the 100k service.  I agreed despite these cheap tactics.  I got the 100 k service done and the next day the truck would not start. 

I had it towed to the dealer.  I was told that the battery connection was corroded and a new battery was needed.  I do not know what they did but my battery which was ok till they did my 100k service was now dead and the cable was corroded.   The estimate was another $650.  Again I had no choice as the truck would have to be towed elsewhere and I am sure they knew I was captive audience.  So now the total was around $2100.   I got the truck home and the radio codes had not been reset when they installed the battery - how sloppy can a dealer be.  So I called the service guys to get them reset.  

My take - be careful as they use cheap tactics to get you in and then nickel and dime you.  This is the last time I am going to these guys.

I will start by saying that soon after I left my info online so that I could receive a quote for a new vehicle, Gillman was the first dealership to contact me. Their prompt reply made me want to go and deal with them, based on my belief (then), that they were good at providing customer service.

It was not until I went there, that I found out they have terrible business practices. They quoted me a car significantly higher than the published sticker price. They tried to justify the high purchase price based on some accessories and upgrades that they had already included on the car, which of course were not requested by me. Simple items such as window tint and wheel locks, were in their minds enough reason to cheat me out of a few thousand dollars more.

That made me feel bad and thought on going out to a second Honda dealership, but they still asked me to leave a deposit down for them to separate my car before leaving. Something which made me feel even worst about such experience.

I ended up going to a second dealership the next morning, and after receiving a very good treatment and a completely transparent offer at such place, I ended up buying the most equipped car in that segment for a better price than the one quoted by Gillman a day before. If you are interested in a Honda and live around Houston, I recommend going to Honda Cars of Katy. They give you more than what is promised and for a much better deal. I suggest avoiding Gillman even if you live next door to their place.

Finally, even though I informed the salesperson and his manager, which by the way called me not less than 10 times within 24 hours, that I had bought the car that I was looking for at another dealership, they still call me every day and leave a message on my cell phone offering me a great deal and asking me what is required for them to get my business. They guy who calls has left several (exceeding 20 messages) in my voicemail and I can barely understand his messages.

I called back in less than 24 hours and they said the price already went up $2,000 and that they would not honor the price they quoted when I test drove the car. When I spoke to the salesman about it, he said the Manager told me 24 hours (which she did not, as my daughter heard her also and I even wrote it down) and that the car was just on sale at the time I looked at it. Either way, it's not my problem if they made a mistake on the price, plus I called back even before 24 hours was up, so their argument is full of it.

I have dealt with numerous dealerships from Houston to San Antonio and Dallas in the past year, as I recently bought a new car and have been looking for a used car for my child for several months. I know car salesmen don't have the best reputation, but this one goes far beyond their usual deceptive practices.  This is the only dealership that I have encountered thus far that when you are trying to make a deal, does not honor what they say and switches things up when you are in the middle of trying to make a deal.",1,41,0,0

We purchased a Subaru Forester here in June. the salesman Ivan told us that they had inspected the car and that the car had also gone to the neighboring Gillman Subaru dealership to be looked at as well because they didn’t always know how to look at Subarus and the Subaru would bring Hondas over to their dealership for them to look at. My wife is a school teacher and she drives very little. In the 5 months we have had the car she has only driven it 3500 miles. She had mentioned a few times after longer drives that the car had a burning smell. There were a few little things we had to fix along the way such as replacing the battery and we had some lights come on for some random sensors. No big deal we are reasonable its a used car we knew we would have to put some money in the car from time to time. When we brought it in for the first oil change the car was a quart and a half low on oil. this was a bit alarming. Our regular mechanic didn’t know what the issue was. I did a little research and found a Subaru specialist in the area. When they looked at it they found multiple serious internal issues with the motor. They believe that the motor had been replaced with a used “junk yard” motor. This motor is in such bad shape that it needs to be replaced or have a serious over haul. We took it to another shop that scoped the motor and found that even worse than it just being a used motor some one had worked on the internals, didn’t know what they were doing and just closed it up. Everything was wrong values, lifters, rings… All wrong. The conclusion is that the motor is shot and needs to be replaced after only 3500 miles. I decided it was time to bring this to the attention of Honda of Spring, being “Houstons most trusted Honda dealership”(according the their website) I figured they would want to make this right. When I arrived I saw our salesperson Ivan and he brought us over his sales manager Alonzo Allen. I asked how they could have possibly had Gillman Subaru check this car out and not find any of the things wrong with it that we had. Immediately Ivan denied having said that they had the car checked out there. In short, they told us we bought the car as is and they weren’t going to do anything even though the sales person had lied to us. It didn’t seem to me that this was the outcome that the dealership would want so I decided to schedule a conversation with the General Manager Jason Jackson at a later time. When I spoke with Jason he said “How do I know that you didn’t do these things to this car?” Seriously, My wife drives this car very conservatively. I’m a reasonable person, giving them the benefit of the doubt that this was just a fluke I offered to trade for another car. Jason offered me $5500. nearly half what we paid for the car a few months ago. We need to get my wife into a reliable car.

2409,2111,30-Jan-18,"We went to this dealership to buy an Odyssey Touring. We did a test drive and finally got to the point of negotiating price. For the whole negotiation, we were talking about out of the door (OTD) price without any trade-in or anything. In addition, we never mentioned about how much we wanted to put down for down payment. We got the the OTD price of $43,000. Then we go to finance office. Everything went fine up until the point we signed the payment paper. We agreed to put down $10,000 as our down payment which means that we will finance $33,000. But NO, on the paper, the amount we needed to finance was $35,000. Turned out, from the beginning, they had put $2,000 as my down payment without my knowledge. Basically, their PRICE WAS $45,000, not $43,000 which I was led to believe. This came at a surprise to my salesman too because as I said, we negotiated the car’s price without any down payment in mind. Moreover, when presenting the finance paper to us, instead of showing, explaining, and checking everything on it (ex: interest rate, down payment, amount finance…), the finance guy just went straight up to the monthly amount and tell us to put initial on it, trying to rush through the paper. If we haven’t caught that, we would of buy that car for $45,000 and thinking it was only $43,000. The final straw that make me writing this is when the finance guy told me that that was never his fault, that $2,000 was on the paper from the beginning and I did not read it (my thought: even your staff did not see this, and you still had to courage to blame it on me????). I understand that dealerships need to make their money somewhere, either car price, finance, extended warranties, or accessories; which is totally acceptable; but what I cannot tolerate is when they are trying to SCAM their customers. Yes, I used the word “SCAM.” Their way of doing business is highly UNETHICAL. After reading my review and you still want to give this dealership a try, by all means, be my guess. At least, keeping my experience in mind and I hope you get a good deal from them. My final warning: EXTREMELY CAREFUL WITH THIS DEALERSHIP!!!!

2438,2142,02-Jul-17,"I purchased a vehicle from this dealership on June 30th, 2017.
I am going to start out this review with the positives:
My salesman James C., Ernest (and his bearded coworker - sorry I did not get your name), and DJ the finance manager. These men handled themselves with dignity and professionalism. My entire experience with my salesman was very positive from start to finish. If I could rate these men alone they would get 5 of 5. I was referring individuals to this dealership due to my interactions and experience with James, before they decided to attempt to not honor an agreement.
The negatives:
The amount of trouble I had to get this dealership, specifically the general manager, to honor an agreement.
Jack O'Diamonds accepted my deposit in May, signed car info and MSRP agreement, and took copies of documentation from me so we would be ready to get the purchase going when the car arrived (ID, Social, Insurance, finance info). Communications with this dealership made every indication the purchase would be made upon arrival. On the last day of the car’s ETA I am told that the manager regrets the MSRP agreement and decided to hold the car for a minimum of 90 days (confirmed by a call I made to the sales manager) to draw customers in to get their moneys worth. I was not informed of this until June 28th (the last day of my ETA). I was told the transport truck with the car arrived, but left without delivering it. I never claimed they had it, just that they rescinded their agreement to sell it to me when it DID arrive.
I have seen claims that I should have talked to the dealership before I posted a video. I confirmed the 90 day hold situation with both my salesman and the sales manager as soon as I was informed and before the video discussing my experience was ever created. I intentionally stayed away from posting any reviews or encouraging individuals to do so, even though it appeared employees were attempting to bait me into posting in the review section by calling me out in their reviews. What other people do with information given is not under my control. 
When the Jalopnik article discussing this situation was posted I was not contacted by the author, who made a couple of incorrect assumptions based off of what other individuals misinterpreted. I saw some errors and immediately posted a clarification (not a retraction) on Facebook publicly, the article comments itself, and emailed the author directly. The dealership has continually addressed issues that I did not claim and ignored the actual issues.
In a meeting that my salesman was not allowed in, even though we requested him, the GM stated he was at fault for this situation, but he was still going to keep the car in the show room. He has on multiple occasions stated if my experience wasn’t positive I wouldn’t have an experience with them at all. I have these claims documented.
In every interaction the GM threatened to give me my deposit back if I didn’t have a positive experience and stop “lying” or attempted to convince me to take my deposit back. Throughout all of this they called it my car, but would not back anything up with writing (since my documents for my initial deposit before they changed their minds about the agreement).
The personal and unprofessional level this dealership took this to.
I received after-hours phone calls from the GM to accuse, manipulate, and vent at me (when he was off work). Employees of the dealership messaged my friends on Facebook to speak negatively of me and call me a liar. Employees who are not friendly towards me attempted to “friend” me on Facebook.
The environment of the dealership when they changed their mind (due to the negative feedback they were receiving) and allowed to purchase the car.
I was not assisted until I texted the GM I had arrived, even though many workers were clearly not busy as they spent their time pacing around us and glaring. Which is unlike the experience my friend had coming in to meet me there. He walked through the doors and was immediately greeted by a nearby salesman. I have these claims documented and witnesses to this.
The bottom line is: dealer’s remorse is not the customer's responsibility. The agreement was honored not because of the integrity of the dealership, but because they got called out. There was time before the backlash got out of control to make this right.
Yes I have my car now, but I am not a satisfied customer. However, I stuck to my agreement and bought the car upon arrival at MSRP.

2449,2157,05-Dec-18,"DO NOT BUY A CAR FROM LUTE RILEY HONDA! I am VERY upset with all of the problems I have had with my 2016 Pilot since I purchased it from Lute Riley Honda.

I am so upset that I feel I must share this with everyone I know so they do not get in this situation. Do not buy a car from Lute Riley Honda. After you finance your car and they get the money they forget about you. I have tried to get my Honda Pilot Fixed at least 5 times. The last time I had the Lute Riley Service Department attempt to fix my Pilot. They made me feel as if they were doing me a favor working on my Pilot. WE PURCHASED THE EXTENDED WARRANTY FROM LUTE RILEY. THEY SHOULD FIX IT AND NOT MAKE ME FEEL AS IF I AM BEGGING TO HAVE IT FIXED. They made money off the extended warranty. BTY, my Pilot is still not fixed.

Some of the Problems I am having:

The Infotainment system crashes and freezes. Sometimes it plays Bluetooth from phones not connected to it.

The computer glitches. For example, shows 0 miles when it has a full tank, will not start, when started there is a light show for about five seconds they it starts. It also locked me in the car and would not let me out. I had to hit the manual unlock about 20 times. There is more, basically a gremlin in my electrical system.

When the computer is acting crazy the Pilot runs very rough.

The Gremlin causes the following; intermittently locking me in the car. Computer needing ""rebooted"" car running rough/losing horsepower on acceleration, stereo/Bluetooth not working. Just to name a few.",1,44,0,0

Specifically we asked if the car was smoked in they said no. They wouldnt let us see the car until after the papers were signed (saying it was getting cleaned). If we would have seen it we definitely would have negotaited. But dont trust!

Yes, of course, but they didn't bother! When I arrived and found out I had just wasted two and a half hours worth of gas for no reason at all, I asked to see the manager. Of course then they try to sell me something else that's almost double the price, appraise my truck for $1000 BELOW blue book trade in value, and refuse to budge at all on the price of the second used vehicle. These people are highly unprofessional. The salesperson I ended up looking at the second car with was also rude.

2453,2161,28-Apr-18,"Visited LR Honda on Tuesday afternoon. Spent 3 hours there visiting with the salesman, test driving the vehicle I was interested in and had my vehicle appraised as a trade-in.  The first part of my visit went well.  Salesman was nice and a good listener. 

Left the dealership with an understanding I was interested in the vehicle.  Needed to confirm my payoff of my vehicle and pursue financing thru my CU.  All of this was communicated to the salesman and sales manager.

I contacted the salesman on Wednesday early afternoon to let him know of my status.  I inquired if he had received my payoff confirmation amount from his sales manager, which I provided to him on Tuesday evening after returning home.  He indicated no he had not.  I told him I was still awaiting approval from my CU.  Not once during this exchange was I told the vehicle had already been sold.

After clearing up some information on my used car loan request I received the approval letter to share with the dealership on Wednesday.  After contacting the salesman to let them know, I was informed the vehicle had been sold Tuesday evening, after I had left the dealership, and was given to sales manager to explain what had occurred.  

I was told they couldn't hold the vehicle, which was not my concern.  I was more upset at the fact that there was no communication between or within the used car sales organization as to if there was any active sales efforts being done on the vehicle? Which I thought would have been me.  And, if in the event it fell through the next interested party would be made aware of it.  This is what I consider good business practice.  

So, if you go to Lute Riley Honda and you are interested in a used vehicle and you can't get it done within their time frame, DON'T BLINK.  It most likely won't be there the next day or maybe I should say later that same day of your visit.  

So, thanks for letting me do all the work I said I was going to do even though you sold it out from under me. Talk about poor customer experience. I will never do business with your dealership and or affiliates.  Plus, I will enjoy telling this story to others.  Good luck in getting their business. 

You get a BIG Thumbs down from me.

2454,2162,29-Nov-17,"I was a victim of my own stupidity and a very shady car dealership.  Yes, Lute Riley of Richardson Texas is this shady car dealer.  Approximately 5 years ago, I purchased a CERTIFIED 2010 honda civic.  The vehicle had a dent in the drivers side floor board which should have been a red flag and would have had I been more experienced.  The dealership showed me the car fax that showed no reported accidents.  This report may have been true and correct, at least the reported part. Several days after getting the car home, my battery died.  I brought the car back to Lute Riley who stated that issue was resolved.  A few days after this, the battery died again, I then took it into Huggins Honda of North Richland Hills Texas.  They were in complete disbelief that this car was sold as Certified.  They showed me a birds nest of wiring in the trunk connected to some metal box that they found to be what was shorting our my battery. It appears the previous owner had some type of sound system that was ripped out but not completely.  They also showed my the the front bumper was not connected properly due to much damage to a large plastic piece under the vehicle that normally is used to secure the front bumper and more.  They also showed me that the hood was pushed back towards the windshield an inch or more.  Since purchasing the vehicle, I have had to use coat hangers and plastic tie wraps to hole the front bumper onto the car. Although I mentioned all of this to Lute Riley they did not help in any way until about 3 years after purchase, I had enough of having to continuously add more tie wraps and coat hangers.  I called back and angrily told them I had it and was more than angry.  They told me to bring the car in and they would look at it and see if there was anything that they could do or would do to help.  Initially they noticed the dent at the drivers side floor board and stated that is why everything is loose some one must have hit something and caused damage under the vehicle.  I explained that this was the case when I purchased the vehicle.  He stated that their is no way that was there at purchase and they had pictures of the vehicle. He logged onto his computer and lo and behold his pictures clearly showed the damage to the vehicle was their while they still owned the vehicle.  He stated that he would help in the only way that he could.  He would replace the front bumper if I would pay $300.00 and all should be good.  I payed the $300.00 and he did indeed replace the front bumper but since he didn't fix or replace the plastic under the car and around the wheels that holds the bumper on, I have had to continue to use coat hangers and tie wraps to keep the new bumper on my vehicle.

I bought a certified car from them a little over a month ago, and it has been with them, since I bought it, more than It has been with me. It started with an issue with the brakes making noises. It took me 8 visits before they finally fixed the brakes. After running a full inspection on the car, I found out that they did not do a brake fluid exchange or a transmission service even though the car was supposed to be due for these before I purchased it.

2500,2216,10-May-20,"Beware of Hidden fees!!! BAIT & SWITCH!
The price they listed on their website is not what they will quote you in person! I also used the USAA TrueCar app which gives Military discount price but they don’t follow it. What is the point of having those apps as a tool for car buying guide if dealership doesn’t follow it. The salesman and manager will always find a way to make an excuse and blame something like inaccurate prices on USAA TrueCar app that promises accuracy and instant price breakdown on vehicles from dealership that they partnered with. I mean c’mon it’s 2020, stop living like it’s 1985! People can find the answer over the internet nowadays and compare. It’s disappointing and that they treat people like veteran customers with a whopping extra $2100 on the top of a used car valued under $15k!!! By the law, consumers only pay for Tax, Title, and License (registration). Document fees should be at the maximum of $150. I was told that the $2100 is to recoup the cost for the reconditioning of the vehicle and when I checked the battery the sticker was dated 06/18 which is 2 years old!!! Make sure y’all check the battery stickers for date (warranty) and tires are stamped with dates because that’s how manufacturers keep track of the warranty! Don’t let dealership ripoff honest people and don’t let Honda Burleson take your hard earned money. Only pay for what is listed on the website and the Actual Vehicle Value. Any extras like tint, wheel locks, and etc are not required to pay by the law! Dealership installed items are gimmicks! I understand the work that is done but if they are going to charge me extra $2100 for reconditioning then why they didn’t even fix the bumper damage of the car. The only thing that is relevant to the repairs are the new tires and that’s it! When I talked to the manager I told him that I don’t want to pay for dealership fee $2100 because it’s not listed on their website. They will try to argue and show you the generic message (footnotes*) thinking they can somehow make you believe that you are required to pay extra because you are stupid enough not to understand the internet price and basic math! Stop making excuses, be fair and honest to customers. Don’t even mention transparency if you can’t itemized the items for charging extra $2100. It’s a xxxx used car! Not an antique. Car buying experience should be fun but my salesman asks me questions like I’m a dollar sign! Be knowledgeable on the product and explain the functionality of the vehicle before proceeding with the price and then don’t go to your manager when you can’t decide about the final price because you don’t make the finance decisions! You’re a salesman for a reason so earn your title, managers manages employees and not customers! I can’t even imagine how they make sales in new car department...

396,2217,12-Mar-20,"The price they advertise online is not what they quote you in person.  We found one of their used cars online and went in to look at it.  I knew there would be extra fees for TTL, but after test driving it we were told the actual price was about $5,000 higher than what it was listed for.  The salesman explained that the additional cost was for the reconditioning fee for work they did on the car to get it ready to sell.  I can understand there being work that needs to be done on the cars and the dealership wanting to recoup that cost.  My issue is why not include that in the advertised price. When we asked our salesman about this he said that no dealership includes that extra cost in their advertised price and if Burleson Honda did no one would come look at their cars because they would be advertised for higher than other dealerships around. I don't know how accurate that statement is.  We felt very deceived.  The added amount took the price out of our budget.   After the back and forth drama that occurs in buying cars they did come down on their price some but we still paid about $2,000 over the advertised price.  Looking back I wish we had got up and walked out but we were in a real crunch with needing a new car.  It just leaves me wondering what else they were deceptive about.  Did they really do the work they claim they did?   As we are starting to look for another used car for my husband we'll look elsewhere since this dealship was deceptive with us.

In my dealings with multiple dealerships, this was the far most worst experience ever. My family has owned Honda for years and that's all my family drives. 
I went to buy a car from them and test drove couple of them. Finally made a choice and told them to bring the numbers. They offered the vehicle for $17995 and these guys bring me the numbers for $24,600. What is kind of deal is this. They hide hidden numbers, without asking me they added $3000 as a warranty on A CERTIFIED USED HONDA!!!! I walked out of the dealership, but Jose Fuentes, the sales manager, came running after us in the parking lot asking for our business. We agreed on the negotiated price. Now came time for finance. They would not agree on the finance rate. We told them we would do cash out buy and they agreed. During all this time they were taking soooooo long to do things, it was time for me to go to work. We agreed that we pay the down payment and come on Monday and finish the final document signing. 
Come Monday, the sales man came and asked me if I still wanted to finance? I thought they are my neighborhood dealership they should get business as well so I agreed to finance. Over the weekend they offered an interest rate, which was within our range. So I told them give me the same  interest rate, I will finance. Marcus McRae, the finance director, who should really apologize the way he behaved approached me and said flat out NO they will not offer the interest rate. This really upset me. I told them what happened to paper on which took my sign and they offered the deal on Saturday. He thought that i would not ask for it. I asked them to call Jose and he  comes and tells me, ""Oh that was just estimate deal"". Folks we are business operating family, when the deal is on the table its a solid when agreed upon. Because Jose Fuentes, on Saturday told me if I increase the down payment he would get me the interest rate, which I did and agreed to pay more down payment. My uncle was with me and he said we would pay the down payment through the company business card. On Saturday, they agreed to charge the credit card. But fast-forward Monday, we were made to sit around for an hour, THE SALES MAN, Allanzo, says he will assist to sign MY finance papers because all the other ""Finance Managers are busy on calls"". A sales man, where is the respect to the customer. After all the paper work is finished Allonzo tell me they cannot charge the card provided. They cannot charge $4000 on a company card because they got new GM and he changed the rules. What kind of business are these guys running. I told them I would give them my company check. I had to drive to 45 mins each way to and fro to get my company check because I did not have access to my personal check with me. I come back and give them the check, they tell me no we cant take the check after 45 mins. This really angered me. They are playing jokes with the customers. Folks, now this had become a very painstaking process. I told them will they charge my personal American Express which they did. Now when I asked Marcus McRae, why wasn’t there a finance manager signing my papers his excuse was that Allonzo is a finance manager in training, which for no reason he could answer any of my questions. I'm an educated person who knows how a person becomes finance manager, being in the business world for so long. Marcus went on to even say why I was starting something, when there is nothing, stating that a salesperson signing my finance document who is not a certified finance manager.

The list prices for the Honda Odyssey are higher than the retail blue book value. I was wrong in looking up the blue book value for this Odyssey having an alloy wheel option, which it didn't have, making the blue book value even lower than the list price.

The bad: there is a lot of it, and there is no excuse. Carl Rathburn, before I drove 5 hours, told me on the phone that as an out of state customer, I could finance using any bank in Texas. I am a USAA member, and USAA IS based in Texas, and therefore it was easy to think I could buy using financing through USAA. Carl told me it would be accepted. Then I get there, and was informed by Carl and a sales manager that they could not take my USAA financing, because I lived in Oklahoma, and that it was a company rule. The reasons: IF the payment didn't work, then they could not easily come to Oklahoma to take back the van I would have just bought, and so they cannot take USAA customers from outside Texas. Never mind that you could drive 5 hours within Texas. So that was a crap reason for the company rule. Now for the additional facts: Honda of Burleson is a USAA Certified Dealer. I found the van I purchased through USAA's Car Buying Service, which gave me a price. Honda of Burleson is supposed to honor their agreement with USAA and accept USAA financing, and for me, they did not, violating their deal they have with USAA. I was instead stuck with their dealer financing, not in a position to apply to any other Texas-based banks' loans due to time, and their dealer financing was an entire 1.99% higher APR than my pre-approved USAA loan.

The cherry on top, the rub my face in the dirt, is that their dealer financing bank, TD Auto Finance, has no location in Texas. On the TD website, they have locations to contact them in Michigan, Maine, and South Carolina.

Later, when I got my permanent license plate, I discovered the screws for the license plate do not match up with the holes, so you can only just start to screw them in.

Also, they did not come down on their list price at all after I counter-offered, so other Honda shoppers will want to remember that if they shop at Honda of Burleson. My reasons why they should have were that it was missing a key ($200 or so to replace) and there were about 800 more miles than they listed it as having. It was also above the retail value by I think at least $2000, however, I did not mention that like I should have.

My experience with Honda of Burleson was dissatisfactory. Carl Rathburn, at best, was too lazy to figure out that they would not accept my USAA financing before I visited, and at worst, lied about it to get me to come see the van. I do not know which it was. And it is a lie that I was going to be required to use a bank based in Texas when Honda of Burleson hypocritically does not have a dealer financer based in Texas. Unfortunately, I have to admit I was screwed and I regret making the deal, which is partly my own fault, I know.",1,46,0,0
2535,2259,10-Apr-20,"Humble Hyundai is not trustworthy. I love the car but can't trust them to perform maintenance services. My engine qualified for a recall. I was expecting a new engine as recalls replace the defective part with a new part. I was told it would take two weeks. It took four. The dealer informed me I received a ""refurbished"" engine. I asked for documentation as to how many miles the ""refurbished"" engine had. They refused to provide that. For all I know I exchanged an engine with 100,000 miles with one that has 200,000. Worse, they may have just ""fixed"" the first engine hoping that would ""solve"" the issue. The point is I don't know and they won't say. Imagine the conversation I will have with another dealer or buyer when it comes time to sell or trade in my vehicle. My odometer says 106,000 miles but since this isn't the original engine I don't know the true mileage. I don't see a buyer giving me any value for my car after that conversation.

I heard from the dealership with 15 minutes of writing a negative Facebook review. I was promised documentation from them stating I received a new engine within 24 hours. Five months later I still haven't received anything. And to kick me while I was down, they installed two new tires because they ran over nails during a test drive. Ok, good service there. Except one of the new tires developed a bulge on the side on my way home. Instead of taking it back, I went to my regular mechanic and paid for a new tire for $115. I'd rather pay than trust them with ""free"" warranty work.",1,47,0,0

Sales person committed 3 years maintenance program free and finance said it did not apply to my purchase.

2555,2281,20-Mar-19,"I tried to buy a used car from this Huffines location in Plano. I have previously bought two new Hyundai cars from this dealership. I had been servicing 3 currently owned vehicles here for the last 9-10 years. I had dealt with Walter in used car sales to purchase vehicle for my daughter. All was well (or so we thought), we picked the CPO vehicle she liked and did the paperwork. We paid and took possession of the car on 3/16. Drove away, daughter tried to pair her phone to what was described to us as the HANDS FREE calling system. It turns out that this was misrepresented, it is only hands free to answer a call, to make a call you have to use your hands to utilize the touch screen/radio panel and dial your number; NOT SAFE. We immediately contacted Walter, who at first insisted it was hands free, told us to bring it back in and he would show us. Turns out I was right, Hyundai, Carfax and salesman all showed this as hands free system, but is not. Walter showed us a different car, a little more expensive but true hands free calling. I am thinking that since this was a clear misrepresentation by the sales staff, there will be some movement on the price or some accommodation made. I wasn’t expecting it for the same price, but I assumed it would come down a little bit, BOY WAS I WRONG! I attempted to speak with the PreOwned Director, Robert Spriggs. I started to explain the situation and that I am a repeat, loyal Huffines customer and explain what I was hoping for. What a waste of time, he is without a doubt, the NASTIEST, MOST UNPROFFESSIONAL  AND generally UNPLEASANT individual it has ever been my misfortune to deal with. There was no discussion, no back and forth, no apology, no nothing; just a take it or leave it attitude, so we left it. I guess his business is so good, they did not need mine. I encourage you to avoid this establishment. There are a multitude of dealerships to bring your business to where it will be appreciated, unfortunately, this is not one of them. I did speak to the General Manager of the Hyundai/Chevy Huffines Plano site, Mr. Roosevelt May the next Monday. He was very nice and apologetic but it was too little too late at this point. We had already purchased a different vehicle at a different dealership. For less than $1000 more than what Robert Spriggs wanted to charge me for a 2 yr old vehicle with almost 40 K miles on it, I got my daughter a brand new vehicle with 8 miles on it and a full warranty!

Now I am baffled at the poor treatment in the service department. He had an appointment scheduled in advance, he dropped his car off and returned to find out not only was his car not done, but he had to come back because, ""they can't get to it till Friday."" So they gave him a ""loaner"" car that he now has to pay $50 to use because of their mistake. So as a recap, he took time off work to deliver his vehicle, he coordinated a ride to and back from the dealership, he called service before returning to get his vehicle, he left the dealership with his broken car, had to bring it back several days later so he could pay an additional $50 for their mistake. We only hope and pray the vehicle is done today. I have directed him to use the dealership in Mesquite from here on out. We will still buy Hyundai's, but we are sad about this service department.

He gave me a price and did not explain to me that the number we agreed on was dependent on me qualifying for a loyalty rebate of $500.

They couldn’t tell me for sure unless I paid. He (Edgar) also shared that the XM radio on the car had a lifetime subscription.

Fortunately, a lady on the new side saw me struggling to apply my new license plates and offered to help with one, but together we couldn’t figure how to apply the second- (her name was Janet Murray- and she encouraged me to reach out to the Manager after I shared with her some of my negative experiences. She was kind and I walked away from that conversation feeling like if I took her advice the company would help or at least follow up- I was wrong, but I appreciate her effort.) With all of the lies, and lack of follow up I feel that this interaction should be recorded to help others know what I experienced. I would not write this if someone would have just done me the courtesy of calling back and hearing me out. My salesperson that I have reached out to and sold me the car and the false information is Edgar (Squiggy) Castillo. I have reached out and asked a Manager to call me with no success. A man by the name of Jorge Acosta called the week of 8/1/17 saying he received my online inquiry about interest in a car. My interest wasn't in buying another car but getting some answers surrounding the one I recently bought. The second time he called, we were either disconnected or he hung up after I requested speaking to Manager. To date, no one has followed up with me.  This is why people don't trust Sales people and at this point I expect nothing. I'm holding my breath to uncover what else is wrong with the car that Edgar may have not disclosed.",1,49,0,0

I thought that was ridiculous i was just asking for a better price i had already have him my credit score.

He took my number and said he would call me . I didnt hear back from anybody.

2628,2361,06-Jun-19,This review is specific to Hyundai service.  Brought my Genesis in for oil change and tire rotation and was told it would take 1.5 hours.  Seemed like a long time for simple service but appreciated being provided proper time expectations.  A little over 2 hours later I am told the car is ready.  Never heard from a service advisor the entire time and I had to ask for checkpoint list to be printed and provided. Several services were recommended on sheet including coolant flush and alignment which are services that were performed around 5 months and 7000 miles ago.  At this point I was not thrilled with my experience but things got much when I walked out to my car and saw a rather large visible scratch on the driver side door.  I went back in to point this out and the advisor who I never saw or spoke with until this point pulled out the iPad to compare pictures from when I first brought car in. None of the pictures had a clear image of the door.  He tried to then buff it out to no avail and then claimed it wasn't that obvious.  He seemed to think all was well so I asked to speak with the manager.  Larry came out and also made the claim that it wasn't that obvious but did offer to take car back to attempt to use electric buffer.  10 or so mins later the car was back with the scratch still in place and very visible. Larry didn't really seem to care and I got the sense from him that he thought I was lying.  He did make a weak offer of painting the door but at that point I did not want to have any further dealings with Freeman.  My car is older and has more than its share of dings but I am 100 percent certain this is new because it is on the middle of the driver side door that I see every time I walk up to car.  I can honestly say this was one of the worst customer service experiences I have ever hadand will never go back to Freeman Hyundai Service.,1,50,0,0

2632,2365,05-Jan-17,"I brought my 2012 Hyundai Sonata purchased at Freeman Hyundai dealership and took it to the service department for repairs to serious defects when vehicle was exhibiting abnormal conditions in both steering and motor seizing. The defect is covered under manufacturers warranty and the defect/condition was reported within the warranty term. The vehicle was defective and unfit for use on public roadways.  I requested a loaner vehicle and detailed estimate/repairs completed paperwork as well as the check in sheet for my vehicle.

I have never received ANY voice messages (or other correspondence) from Aaron my service assistant. I did however receive a certified letter threatening to sell my 2012 Hyundai Sonata VIN KMHEC4A43CA020727 at public auction. I have sent repeated emails to the service department requesting a detailed estimate/repairs completed paperwork & update and have not received the requested paperwork.

I have never encountered such disregard for a customer consumer of a large purchase such as the new vehicle which I purchased from Freeman Hyundai  in 2012.  I greatly regret having done business with Freeman Hyundai.

Hyundai was forced to recall almost a half a million Sonata's for defective motors. They routinely denied warranty for a KNOWN defect to their theta gas engines and instead blamed the consumer across the board for lack of maintenance. Hyundai tells Sonata owners they must produce a complete set of maintenance records even though they know the Sonata engines fail regardless of owner maintenance due to the faulty rotating assembly. My experience is no different so I am left with the only recourse available to me.

2646,2380,17-Sep-19,"I bought a car recently at North freeway hyundai and the salesman is Jean Babtiste Leconte.  Mr. Leconte sold me a car which he knew had a broken hood release mechanism that release the hood;  that's why he had the hood already up before I had the chance to try to open the hood myself,  so I couldn't attempt to look under the hood and detect the hood release mechanism was broken.  If I had known that the car had a broken hood release mechanism I would never have bought that car, and Mr. Leconte  knew it.  He had the hood up on that car already by  pulling a string that no one should have to do just to open a hood of a car.  When I returned the car back to North Freeway Hyundai to complain about the hood release lever not working,  Mr. Leconte made outlandish reasons why the mechanism was broke including I could have ""damaged the mechanism when I drove it .""

2653,2387,17-Sep-17,"First, I was informed that if I left them positive feedback on Google or other sites that they would install window tinting on my car for free. I would save about $150 from having to do it myself. I have decided that the truth is more important than the money I would save. So here is the truth about this dealership. I was shopping for a car as a replacement to one my son killed in the recent Hurricane Harvey and so I decided to give him my new Prius V (Love that car!) and replace it with a high-end cushy Genesis G80 Ultimate package. So far, I love the car itself BUT no one ever took the time to explain anything about how the car works, maintenance requirements or any of the many perks that come with the purchase of a Genesis like Service Valet. Then when I got home, the next day I realized they let me leave the dealership without the lug key required to remove my wheels if I got a flat. I reached out to the salesman various times during the week and that is when I saw the real way they treat customers. Nice folk if you are actually in the act of buying a car but don’t have any time for you after you have already purchased the car. All I kept getting was the same “Oh, I am sorry. We are getting slammed by people wanting to purchase cars” throughout the week. My needs were never a high priority to them; only selling more cars was important. At the end of the week, when I was attempting to start using some of the perks for purchasing a Genesis I found out that they let me leave the dealership without any and I do mean ANY of the sales documentation. Not even what my final deal looked like. How much I paid for the car. No documentation for how to create Genesis accounts or sign up for anything. The finance guy handed me an envelope at the end of my deal and I assumed that all I required documentation was in that envelope. Nope; Nada!  Just some Platinum warranty documentation for 0$ deductible 10 year 100K mile bumper to bumper warranty contract I purchased, an odometer statement and literally nothing else. Can you believe they sent me on my way without even documentation for how much I paid for the car; that the car was even mine or a method of taking my tire off in an emergency. No return phone call back to me that the key was even ordered for me until I reached out to the dealership general manager’s office. BTW, my car purchase price was $48500 ish cash deal so you can imagine what you might get in terms of customer satisfaction if your purchase price is less. At no time did anyone explain anything to me. My hope is that now that the general manager’s office is involved things might get better. I will update my review of this dealership if things get better but as for now, I would rather take my new car to a Ford dealer for service than North Freeway Hyundai. I could not image what my next visit to this dealership might yield.

After dealing with the credit union and getting the car I was told that there were not problems with the car.

She had no idea what she was talking - I only found that out once I started working with Heather.  Heather then told me I could get the 0% financing through Nissan, but I wasn't eligible for the Nissan Cash (now the price is ~$49K).  When I went to sign my paperwork for my new vehicle, the finance guy (can't remember his name) told I could get the 0% financing through Nissan, but the not all the discounts Heather told me I could get.  NOW the price of the truck is well over $50K.  In the short span of an hour, the truck I wanted went from $44K to over $50K.  Talk about a bait and switch.  So, I'm still at the dealership and faced with a decision; do I take the high-priced bait and switch offer to get 0% from Nissan, or do I get my own loan though my bank to get the original $44K online offer?  While I'm crunching the numbers and determining the benefit of 0% (with a higher priced truck) or a substantially lower priced truck (with a loan from my bank), the General Manager (GM) decides to run my credit (hard credit pull).  I called my bank (not knowing what the General Manager was doing) and spoke with them about my loan application - I negotiated a MUCH better rate (2.69%) than when I checked the rates earlier in the morning.  After the GM pulled my credit, I'm brought a piece of paper with other bank offers - none of them came close to my bank.  I rejected the other bank offers and then...  The senior finance guy comes out (I don't remember his name).  He tries to tell me that I'd ""really being helping out World Car Nissan and other customers"" if I took one of their preferred banks' offers.  I explained to the finance guy how three different people told me three different prices for the exact same truck and then told him I was not interested in helping out the dealership that deals the way they do.  During this whole process, I spoke with the GM (Leon Reid) three times.  Each time, he heard what I was saying, but I could see he wasn't listening (he was already preparing what he wanted to say while I was speaking).  Each time, he never addressed the issue - his people are completely untrained and don't know how the rebates/discounts work.  His response each time was how he was basically doing me a favor by speaking with me (while trying to be my pal and telling me how he's ""down in the trenches with all the sales people"").  I was completely underwhelmed with him and his staff.  Bottom Line:  Don't trust what is on their website, or what you are told by anyone there.

We test drove a car, and although the car interior was extremely dirty it drove very nicely. She then turned us to her manager/ financial person. He was extremely pushy and rude! I went in wanting to test drive a Sentra waited for 4 hrs to test drive 1 car. Not a Sentra! When asked if I was ready to purchase, I answered not yet I’m gonna test drive a Sentra with Gun dealership. His reply was well how much are they offering their car. I replied $8,400 with 94,000 miles, keep in mind your Sentra was $8,700 with 106,000. He replied with a Snarky comment about it only being a couple miles more and was still pushing the (dirty) sonata, not even offering the Sentra!!! I ended up purchasing the vehicle from Gun.

2682,2418,03-Nov-18,"Last Saturday, I purchased a 2017 Nissan Rogue from the Hyundai Used Car dealership (World Car Nissan Hyundai North in San Antonio, TX). It had 8163 miles on it and 1 owner. The sales rep, Akeem Mercer, did a perfectly fine job and the process itself is not necessarily the issue, although I walked in with an approval of 3.79% and they assured me they could match that interest rate. When I got to the finance side of the house, the interest rate jumped to 3.94%. I could have sat there another hour or 2 to get my percentage rate but I was willing to overlook the ""mistake"".

My issue has to do with the service after the sale. When I had the car delivered and the keys handed over to me (Intelligent keys), I realized there was only 1 set. Recognizing that should the battery die or we lose this set, my wife could be stranded with no way to get the car going, I immediately reached out to the rep via text who stated he would look for a 2nd set. He later replied that there was no other set and he could ""order one for me for a couple hundred"". I was shocked at this point. Why was this becoming my problem? I then looked in the glove box for what to do if we did have a non-functional set of keys and there was no Owners Manual.

The following Monday, I got an email from the store Sale Manager:

""As a manager here at World Car Hyundai North I wanted to make sure your expectations have been met.   Has my team answered all of your questions? Is there anything you are still looking for?
 
Please let me know. I am here if you need anything.

Sales Manager""


I responded with all of the issues I stated above, expecting to get resolution for my problems. I did not hear back from him that day so sent a 2nd email asking if he really wanted to know about my experience - he responded he truly did so I resent my original message. I still did not hear back from him so I called him Wednesday morning to inquire as to what he was going to do and he said he would call back. He did call a few hours later and said he had a Manual for me but could not get me a 2nd set of keys. He stated it was not unusual for a used car not to have a second key for the vehicle and my only resolution would be to buy it.

At this point, I was beside myself because this was NOT my issue. The fact that they did not get the 2nd key from the original owner was and should not be my problem and they should replace it at no cost. I went on to explain that had this been brought up during the negotiation of the sale, I would have either asked them to drop the price to the amount i would have to buy the 2nd set for or I would not have signed the ""As Is"" paperwork. In other words, I was never given a chance to know that this 2nd key was missing so how could I have been able to negotiate properly. I feel as if I have been misled by not having this conversation. Not to mention that when I buy that 2nd set of keys, I am paying MSRP whereas they could most likely get it at cost which would be significantly less.

Earlier today (Friday) I went to the dealership to get the book but the one they had for me was for a Rogue Sport. I told them I had a Rogue and not a Sport that same manager came out and said it was the same book and that depending on when it 2017 it was, they had gone to an ""online version of the Owners Manual"". I told him I wanted the correct one and we once again went down the replacement key path. After he tried to explain again about the key and I restated my point, I went to the Nissan dealership in an effort to get an Owners Manual myself and to ask if it was true about the ""online version"". It was not true so now he had lied in an effort to get me ""resolved"". I then took up the issue of the key. Long story short, the local Nissan sales rep tried to help, going back and forth with his management and finally informed me the GM from the Hyundai shop was coming over to discuss this with me. Who did it turn out to be? The same Sales Manager. We went thru everything again and he finally said ""I will get you a replacement manual but I WILL NOT get you a second key"" - just as adamant as it is written.

This dealership is only concerned with the immediate sale with no care of the service after the sale. Once they had my money, they were no longer interested in my situation that they had technically created. Had I known that this was going to occur, I promise you I would have walked out of the store because I would have known then that this was how they treat their customers.

I will make sure none of my friends go to this location. I will be putting this on my Facebook in a public post so everyone that reads it is aware of their lack of integrity and the desire to do the right and morally correct thing. I will also post this at my Twitter, Yelp and the stores Facebook account. This is now about the principle of how a vendor treats its customers after the sale is done. The reality is we are talking about less than $100 at their cost. Even if I DO have to pay for a 2nd key, I promise not to purchase from World Car Nissan Hyundai North.",1,52,0,0

2684,2420,24-Nov-17,"Called to World Car Hyundai North to make sure the two Santa Fes listed had the Tech Package and Jolissa went over the vehicle sticker and confirmed that both Ultimate’s 2.0T included the Tech Package. Went to the dealership and learned that Jolissa could not sell the car because she is an online coordinator and not a salesperson. But one of the managers was quick to retrieve the keys according to the VIN numbers she provided. Fred became my salesperson. We went through the paperwork and the 1st RED FLAG was when he offered the protection package (paint and leather sealing). According to Fred the paint sealer lasts 4 years, actually the best sealer on the market only lasts 1 reason why even this seal requires to reapply every year.  2nd RED FLAG, Fred offered to give me an additional $500 discount going with their financial company vs. Randolph Brooks Federal Credit Union (RBFCU) and told me that it was all the same. I then asked to show me the interest rate to compare…surprise, surprise, nice deception attempt. Fred’s offer was for a 4% vs. RBFCU’s 1.9%. He then removed the $500 discount offer. So make sure you see the details of EVERYTHING. We went to eat while they were making the “car ready” and paperwork ready. Wanted to make sure that somewhere in the warranty paperwork there was mention of the turbo engine been covered as part of the powertrain lifetime warranty and it took a while, but they were able to find the info and show us.  3rd RED FLAG, Asked about transferring my Disabled Veteran plates but was told that I had to do that myself since I was not turning in the other vehicle as trade-in. Called the Tax Office to check how to transfer the plate and was told that the dealer should have done it for me because not it was going to cost me more and it was going to be 3 transactions vs. the 1.  4th RED FLAG, Next day I was going over setting all remotes and instructions and noticed that items included in the Tech Package were missing. The dealership keeps records of all messages with customers and they know that Jolissa mentioned to me that the vehicle had the Tech Package. So Fred offered to take the vehicle back.  5th RED FLAG, The vehicle was handed over on the first day with filthy windows, protective tape still installed. The “get ready” was just removing the seat plastic covers and maybe rinsing the outside of the vehicle. Reason why there were dirty footprints on the back doors ledge where someone stepped on to reach the top of the car when drying. Didn’t pay for the extra protection so I got a lousy vehicle “get ready” job. 6th RED FLAG, Fred called me to bring the paperwork and have the DV plates issue resolved. I also mentioned and showed him the issued w/ “get ready” job. He told me that he was going to do it right since I decided to keep the car. This place CAN’T keep commitments or promises. Half an hour later Fred tells me the vehicle is ready. Fred removed the two protective tapes I showed him and that was it. Got back to work and decided to take a quick look. ALL other tapes are still installed, the dirty footprint is still in the same spot. The panoramic roof had round water marks from objects that were placed on it and not cleaned.    He did nothing to the vehicle. A week later, I keep finding items covered in plastic.  Believe I made a terrible mistake.",1,52,0,0

Which is a change from the experience we had in 2011 when we purchased our first Hyundai Sonata from your dealership.  The salesperson listened to what we did and did not want to do.  However, the backoffice seems to be antiquated and needs to focus on what the customer says they want.  An informed customer does not want or need the to follow the ""checklist"" approach that is used with most people.  We also felt as though we were treated with bias (profiled) by the backoffice during this transaction.  We could try to explain it, however this is not something tangible that you will be able to pinpoint.  If you really are concerned about equal treatment of your customers, you should make some changes in management and educate your employees.  Also, no one wants to deal with a manager who is not genuine (to put it nicely), so him stepping in to ""save the day"" was ridiculously orchestrated and we would have preferred to just have the salesperson deliver the good news.

2690,2426,24-Jun-17,"Here is what happened to me during my purchase of a 2017 Hyundai Sonata at World Car Hyundai in San Antonio, TX. After reading this you should understand why I scored the survey as I did.  On Saturday June 10th my wife and I visited the dealership looking for a 2017 Hyundai Sonata Limited. The sales person greeted us and showed us what was available on the lot. I had gone through Truecar and this is what led me to this dealership. There weren’t a lot of choices available on the Limited model in San Antonio. We found the 2017 Hyundai Sonata Limited 2.0 Turbo and test drove it. We liked the vehicle very much and decided to go forward with the purchase. During the negotiations the dealership presented a price and ultimately we decided on a price $500 less. Everything was set. I was going to pay cash but was told I could save more money if I financed with Hyundai so I did. From the time we agree on a price to the time I actually got the vehicle took approximately 4 hours. Seemed like forever. The financing when through just fine. We scheduled an appointment to have the appearance package added to the vehicle the next week. We drove the vehicle home and thought everything was good.   Three days later I get a call from the finance guy saying I added the wrong vehicle to my insurance. The VIN on the vehicle from the ID card they have does not match what they sold me. I verified that the VIN on the ID card is indeed the vehicle they sold me. Then the finance guy realized they screwed up and did the whole deal on the wrong vehicle. He said I would need to sign all new paperwork. I agree to meet him at a Starbucks halfway between my house and the dealership and sign the correct paperwork. I met him and while I was going through the new paperwork when I can to the document with the total purchase price I noticed the price had increased by $2600. He did NOT tell me this, I’m the one that pointed it out. I said we have a problem. This is not the price we negotiated. He said he understood but the price we negotiated was on a different vehicle. I said that was not my fault. I test drove the vehicle I wanted. And in good faith negotiated the price on that vehicle. He said I would have to drive back to the dealership and speak to the sales manager.   I drove all the way back to the dealership. Spoke with the sales manager and he said the only thing they can do is reduce the price by $500. I said that was unacceptable. They should give me the price we negotiated. It was not my fault that they used pricing on a different vehicle. He accused me of wanting free money. I requested to speak with the General Manager. Gave him my story and he agree to give me $1200 off but not the full $2600 price increase. This whole time neither the Sales Manager or General Manager EVER ONCE apologized to me for what was happening. The salesman we had (Andy Bailey) did apologize but he was the only one. I was in a dilemma. On one hand I wanted to scrape the whole deal and get my trade-in back. But we had the new vehicle for 3 days and I had no idea what had happened to my trade-in. Plus we had been looking for a new vehicle for awhile and had gone to a few dealerships and was so ready for the process to be over.   All said and done, they agree to reduce the total to $1500, but not the full $2600. I agree because I just wanted it to be over. I still feel this was wrong. I believe that World Car should have stood on THEIR mistake and compensated me financially as well as ALL the time it took doing this. They were completely unprofessional (again not Andy Bailey the salesman).   So the next week I take the vehicle in for the appearance package (on a Friday). Was told I would get it back the same day. I got it late the next day and there were scratches on the driver and passenger side window tents which the service guy pointed out to me. So  we set up ANOTHER appointment. I went back the next week and got the windows redone.   All told, I have been to World Car Hyundai 5 times in two weeks. I live 20 miles away.   This is why I scored the survey as I did.

146,2429,02-Jun-17,"If I could give ""0"" stars, I would. I learned the hard way that these criminals cannot be trusted. I received their ""Money Carlo"" promotion by mail on 05/30/2017, which stated that I had won a $5,000 prize. I called the dealership, advised them that I had no interest in purchasing a vehicle but wanted to confirm that I had, in fact, won the $5,000 prize--that I did not want to waste a trip to the dealership if I had not won the prize. The representative advised that ""yes"", I had won the prize but that she would need to schedule an appointment for me. She further advised that they would ""probably cut [me] a check"" when I present for the appointment. On 06/01/2017 I drove to World Car Nissan (I do not live close to the dealership) where I was advised that I had not, in fact, won the $5,000 prize but instead had won an opportunity to play a scratch-off game ticket. I left with only a $5 Walmart Gift Card. Furious, I called the dealership back upon returning home and requested to speak with a sales manager. I was advised by a customer service representative that a sales manager was unavailable but would call me back. I expressed my concerns about the promotion to the representative and advised him that the fine print on the promotion is highly misleading and may constitute deceptive trade practice under both federal and state law. He responded, ""I agree with you, sir. I'm on your side. It is a little bit of deception; we have to get peoples' attention."" He further added that the staff ""probably needed to be trained a little bit more, so everyone's on the same page"" and that ""several other people have called up here upset about this promotion."" I received no return call from a sales manager but instead was forced to file complaints with the Texas Attorney General's office and with the Federal Trade Commission. I am currently seeking an attorney to represent me with this claim. On 06/02/2017 I called the dealership back and requested to speak with a sales manager. Initially, I spoke to sales manager Jason, who began arguing with me when I voiced my concerns about the promotion, stated ""this call is now over"", and hung up the phone on me. I called back and was then transferred to sales manager Ralph, who also began arguing with me. I advised Ralph that I would be seeing the dealership in court. Do NOT trust these people.

408,2432,25-Feb-17,"My Fiancé and I found a great vehicle for our family. Decided to take a test drive and start our paperwork and vehicle appraisal. While waiting for the appraisal, which they said would take about 40 minutes, we decided to run an errand, our sales person was well aware of. When we came back to the dealer after about 45 minutes the minute we walked through the door they wanted to know what we still owed on our trade in. To us that was irrelevant because we already had our finance preapproved through our own lender. That's when everything went south. The sales person cut off my fiancé in mid sentence and stormed off to tell one of the finance guys ""they don't want to give us the numbers"". My fiancé then walked right up to the sales person and told her it was very unprofessional what she had done and said she was no longer going to help us and to get someone else that will. Once that sales person came over, they were and continued to be honest and nice through the rest of the experience. At this point, a sales manger then comes over and tell us that someone else has purchased the vehicle in cash. Didn't even drive the vehicle. As we are actively working a deal, some one else jumps in and steals the car??? Talk about quantity and not quality from a dealer! After a bit of back and forth whit this sales manager, the general manager comes out and lets me know that this is normal practice in his dealership and that's how he runs it. That it wasn't the 1st time and most likely won't be the last time. My jaw dropped. I was almost at a loss for words when I'm usually not.

I waited an hour and a half AFTER they were done working on my vehicle since no one bothered to come tell me.  After I paid, they didn't give me the keys. I had to ask 3 different service advisors where my keys were since no one knew or cared to find out. Finally got my keys 5 minutes later.",1,53,0,0

Seriously,  the fluids top off should be done and always done even at small shop free of charger and the one gallon of windshield liquid is about $1.30 at Walmart , however the service guy was trying to digging in the car to find problem so they can charge me a lot for it , for example they said the licinced plate bulb is out and trying to charge me almost $50 bucks to fix it however I did fix it my self with $5 bucks of new bulb from autozone, I am very dissatisfied.

I wanted to make sure that this paint job would be durable, and he promised that only hitting a curb or an acid bath would damage it. The paint job ended up being flaky, so they repainted it, and then it was as soft as a fingernail. The salesman said I'd have to sell the wheels on the aftermarket and buy new ones on my own. When I took this up with the general manager of the dealership, he acted shocked and appalled. But when I drove down to the dealership again, this manager was half an hour late showing up, then completely dismissed my claims, raising his voice at me, and then showing me the same paint job on his Range Rover (yes, he doesn't drive a Hyundai).

I am 83 years old and did not want to deal with this guy. Granted I got a little sideways, and not being able to understand everything that he was SCREAMING, I asked him where he was from. This made him even madder and he started yelling at me on the phone. THIS IS HIS job to diffuse customers and to deal with the issue. At this point, he says his dealership will no longer service my car and I had to find another dealership. Granted I should not have gotten irritated, but his attitude left little room. George does not deserve a job at what once was an outstanding dealership, but he has ruined any chance of doing business with these people again.

2768,2515,19-Nov-19,"In Sept, I was looking for a late model red Ford F-150, 2 WD.  I found one on Baytown Hyundai's website so I began an online conversation with a sales person.  I live about 5 hours away, so I wanted to be sure it was what I wanted before I drove to Houston.  I specifically asked if it had Sirius radio and was told Yes.  The next Saturday, I drove to Houston and made a deal on the truck.  As I left in the red F-150, I tried to tune to Sirius.  It wasn't there.  I immediately called the sales person I had used and she sounded genuinely surprised.  Apparently, she didn't actually check before she told me it had Sirius.  I told her I was turning around and we would have to undo the deal.  She called back in a few minutes and said she was looking at Sirius add-ons on Amazon and they were available up to $100.  She told me they would pay to have it added.  With that promise, I turned around again and headed for home.  When I got home, I got on the Internet and discovered she was looking at devices that could be added when the vehicle was 'Sirius-ready', which my truck wasn't.  My truck had to have a different device installed that would make it 'Sirius-ready' as well as the devices she had looked at.  I called an auto audio/video shop and got a price, installed, of almost $500.  I called Crutchfield and found the hardware for $349, without installation.  I sent her the written info from the audio/video shop and Crutchfield and asked her to verify the amounts by checking with some shops in Houston.  Later she called me and said the would up their offer of payment to $200 and that they were ""trying to be fair"".  I asked her if she really thought that was fair and that I wasn't trying to be difficult...I just wanted what I was told...the truck with Sirius.  At that point, her boss - who had apparently been listening - jumped in and angrily said they ""were already losing money and weren't going to pay any more"".  I reiterated to him that I was told in writing (email) that the truck had Sirius before I drove several hours to buy it and all I wanted was what I was told.  (Why was he angry with me?  It was his sales person that had messed up.)  He, again angrily, said he would reimburse me the $349, which meant I would either have to install it myself or pay someone to do it.  But I agreed just end the nightmare. I ordered the items from Crutchfield and faxed the invoice to the dealer.  It took 5 weeks and several phone calls and emails to get reimbursed. ",1,55,0,0

2785,2533,23-Feb-19,"I've waited about 8 hours to post this review in order to give myself time to wind down and think through the entire experience.  it's still the single worst experience I've ever had with a car dealer.  The level of dishonesty is truly mind-boggling.

I've been looking for a pick-up for my soon to be 16 y.o. son.  The dealer website as well as the Cargurus.com website both listed a 2011 Toyota Tundra available at South Loop Hyundai.  It looked nice and was in our price range.  It is also a little over a 2 hour drive from our town to their location.  I called 1st thing Saturday morning to verify they still had the truck and ask a few questions.  Karen answered my call and said she would check to verify that they still had the truck.  I explained that we would be driving a long way and that I didn't want to waste a trip that far. 

She called me back and said they definitely had the truck.  I asked her if there were any issues or any damage not visible in pictures, no matter how small or insignificant.  She assured me the truck was in great shape and that their service department always does a thorough inspection before they list a vehicle for sale.  I said OK, that I would drive down with my wife and son.  She asked to schedule an appointment and I gave her the time we would arrive.

We caught some traffic on the drive down to Houston and we were running a little late.  Karen called me back to verify that we were still coming.  I apologized that we were running late due to traffic and asked to verify that the truck was still available.  She said it was and that she'd be happy to see us when we arrived.

We arrived at the dealership and were greated at the door by a salesman who was clearly expecting us.  When I gave my name, he knew exactly which truck I was interested in and IMMEDIATELY SAID THAT THEY HAD SENT THE TRUCK TO AUCTION EARLIER IN THE WEEK BECAUSE IT HAD ""LOTS OF ISSUES"".

I thought maybe he was talking about a different truck.  I pulled up on my phone the truck I wanted and explained that I had verified with Karen twice that the truck was available.  He immediately became very defensive and said that the truck I wanted was gone and had issues.  He actually said ""you should be glad we aren't selling you that one"" and proceeded to tell me he would find me another, similar one at one of their other dealerships.

I immediately told him ""no"" and walked out clearly angry.  First one, then a second manager followed us to my truck and apologized... sort of... they clearly had no idea who Karen was and after looking at the phone # she called me from, they told me that was someone from their internet sales team... located somewhere else entirely.  The manager said they sent the truck to auction because ""it wouldn't even start"" and they ""don't sell vehicles with that kind of issue"".

It is absolutely, 100% certain that they knew they didn't have that truck on the lot when I called the first time.  They didn't care about anything but getting me to their dealership to try to pressure me into buying something else.  By the way the salesman was waiting for us when we arrived, he clearly knew they didn't have the truck and he had clearly already talked to Karen.  If he hadn't, he wouldn't have known my name or which vehicle I was interested in.  Either of them could have called me to let me know they didn't have the truck, (I know they had my phone #, they called mid-trip to verify I was coming).  Instead they wasted almost 5 hours of my day plus the expense of gas and eating out just to get me to walk in their door.

There isn't an apology they can offer that will undo what they did.  They were deliberate and determined in their dishonesty.  They have thoroughly and completely earned as much distrust as is humanly possible to give them.

2787,2535,19-Sep-17,"After having a total loss of my Hyundai Genesis during Hurricane Harvey, I decided that I would purchase a new car of the same make and model that I had previously. I made initial contact by the internet to start the shopping process. Once the Internet Manager discussed what I was looking for and my immediate concerns, she advised that she had spoken to her Sales Manager and that they were able to find financing and that she was at the point where my family and I could come and go to the financing department to finish the purchase. We arrived and found out that what she said was not true. We agreed to go ahead and negotiate even though they initially were deceptive. The sales man takes us to a car that they had picked out. When he opened the door, I noticed discoloration on the floor board and a smell that led me to believe had been flooded. I asked the sales man at that point whether the vehicle had been flooded. He stated that the dealership had not been affected by the flood and they had confirned that none of the cars on the lot had been flooded. We go back inside to discuss financing and the sales man begins to agressively discuss the benefits of leasing and I advised that I was looking to finance a vehicle. He responds that the vehicle would be much cheaper as a lease. And that more than likely for them to meet the amount of what I had set as my monthly payment limit, leasing would be my best option. I asked if he could give me an idea of what my monthly payment would be with financing versus leasing. Of course all of the numbers for financing were over my limit. We began to discuss again leasing with him explaining again how this purchase would be better as a lease with the fact that my car that I had previously didn't have gap insurance and there was a balance that would have to be added in to the purchase amount for the new vehicle. Several times I left the dealership throughout this negotiation because I felt they were wasting my time when I would only agree to the terms that I had initially asked for, before setting a foot on their property. Each time, they would call and tell me that they would meet my terms. When I would come back, it was the same thing. They would start again offering conditions that did not meet my conditional limits. I am upset with myself for not walking away then. However with my home being uninhabitable from the flood and losing my vehicle too, I would now identify myself a motivated buyer. We finally agree to the lease and go to financing, each tine they would negotiate a monthly payment for the lease, the allowed mileage would decrease without advisement. The sales manager would state a certain amount of miles for one price, the sales man would gloss over the mileage and each time they would advise that it wouldn't matter because more than likely since I was loyal to the brand that when the end of the leasing term would occur, I would purchase the same brand and there would be a mileage waiver due to loyalty. So the finance manager started by stating the details of my purchase including allowed mileage, he advised that the monthly payment would be based on 10,000 miles although the sales manager had just said 12,000. I stopped him and told him what we had been told, he contacted the sales manager, who then comes to the finance office. He again states that it won't matter because I was loyal to the brand and would purchase the same Make of car at the end of my lease. We agree to completing the financing. After all the papers were signed the finance manager asked why we agreed to a lease, I told him that the sales department had advised that this was the only way they could meet my monthly payment limit. He calculated what he thought would be the amount as financed, it was a little more than my limit but I asked could I change to finance, I am not sure still days later what was his response when I think about it now. We finish and go back to the sales man who makes delivery of the vehicle. When I get in, I noticed that they had sprayed some type of fragrance that smelled like an air freshener. I thought it was weird that a new car would have been sprayed with air freshener which was not done with the previous car that I bought from the same dealership a year and a half ago. I haven't met a person in my life that doesnt like the new car smell. The vehicle had 19 miles on it at the time of purchase and should have smelled like a new car. It's late the dealership is closing, I just go with it. The next day, Thursday I drive to work and back and the car still smells like the air freshener. Friday morning, I open the door to get to work and the car smells like mildew. I contact my husband and we agree to meet so that he could assess the car. On the way there, I am nauseous the whole time. We meet. He smells it and agrees that the car did smell like mildew. We call the Sales Manager and he told us that if the car smells and we had concerns to definitely come to the lot and they could swap it out for another car to ensure we were satisfied. They take the car to the Service Department where the Service Manager and my husband inspected the car to confirm there were other signs of water damage including rust on the brake disc, the shocks, and other aluminum parts of the engine. There were parts of the suspension front and back that showed corrosion. My husband points out the signs of water damage. The Service Manager then admits that they had, ""two cars that had flooded."" The Service Manager tells my husband that he disagrees. As they continue to discuss the service manager says that if we were not satisfied that we could go back in and just swap out the car. We go back to Sales, they leave us waiting for an extended amount of time. The Sales Manager finally comes back and says that since they didn't see signs of damage there was nothing he could do. We express our dissatisfaction. He agrees to go back and negotiate with the General Manager to see what they could do to ensure we were satisfied. He comes back and says the General Manager agreed to allow me to choose another car of the same model with the same features. All of them still have the same discoloration of the floorboard and the smell. The discoloration made the grey carpet look green in spots. I asked if they could show me a car that had been delivered after the burricane, the sales man advised that they didn't have cars that had been delivered after the flood. We find out that they had not submitted the financing paperwork and the Finance Manager states that he didn't get my signature on the right line on one of the forms. I have never re-signed any paperwork and am concerned that they would forge my signature because they seem to serve customers with no morality. We expressed dissatisfaction again. I call customer service of the credit card that I had used for down payment, I was advised that the dealership had put a hold on the amount put had not claimed it so it was still considered pending and if they didn't claim it within 72 hours it would release the hold. My husband tells the Sales Manager that he wants to go to Dallas, San Antonio or Austin to look. I tell my husband that there are other dealerships that are closer to our home. The sales manager stated, ""everybody's cars in the city were flooded."" I tell him that this may be true however every dealership was not going to try to sell their flooded cars. We leave with the agreement that they would not claim tbe money and were free to continue shopping elsewhere. As we are driving away, the Sales Manager contacts us and asks that if he could get another vehicle from one of the cities my husband had named, would I be interested. I agreed that I would. The weekend passes and we have no contact with the dealership especially because my husband's mother had a stroke and passed away. The sales manager contacted me on Monday asking what colors did I want. I answer and ask him how I would be able to confirm that the car was coming from another city. He said he would be able to verify. Today, we call the sales manager to find out why they had claimed the funds. He stated because he was going to be able to get a car in either later today or tomorrow. We agreed but gave the condition that we would need to have evidence that the car came from another city. He stated that this was not a problem. We get off the phone. An hour later, the sales manager calls back and says that now the General Manager would not authorize bringing in another car since they didn't agree the first car had been flooded. My complaint is with the deception they used to make the sale, the inconsistency in the information they would relay, feeling pressured in to leasing a car, not fulfilling the remedy that they kept promising would result in an undamaged vehicle, and the continious lying that they did. I am at a point where there is a loss of my money in a product that would cause health concerns and not be able to provide all the safety that an undamaged car would have. My desired settlement would be either a complete refund or that they fulfil the continued promises to bring in another car from another city not affected by the hurricane. I feel they continued to delay until they could take my money and once they had it to deny us any recourse to ensure our satisfaction. The sales manager kept repeating in the initial call that he wated to ensure that we were completely satisfied. However in his follow up call, there seemed to be no concern to do what he promised.

However, after finishing negotiations for my lease, I was completely forgotten about for roughly 3 1/2 hours. I was told by my salesman that finance would be getting to me soon to finish paperwork. I followed up with my salesman twice by walking over to his desk on why there was such a delay. To which he mumbled ""they're busy."" I considered leaving the dealership when one of the manager's walked by me who looked puzzled since I'd been sitting there for so long. I told him what was happening and he walked over to finance and told them to get my paperwork started. Thus, no one had been notified that my negotiations were finalized. I was at the dealership from 9:30AM til 7:30PM. Paperwork took an additional 2 1/2 hours because the lease wasn't printing out right and kept being filled out incorrectly. I asked if the odometer was noted on my lease and asked if it matched what was currently on the car I'd be getting. I was told ""yes"" saw that they noted 10 miles on the odometer and trusted that this was correct. When I got home with my ""new"" car I noted that there were actually 450 miles on the odometer. At this point, I did not even feel it worth me bringing it back up with the dealership because my experience and customer service were so poor. No one gave me information on when/where I'd be paying my lease. No one told me when I should bring my car in for routine service.

I was shocked as I was thinking whatever the issue was, it wouldn't be this bad as I wasn't having any engine problems nor was I hearing any knocking coming from the engine.  After much thought I decided to get a couple of second opinions.  The first mechanic that looked at it, popped my hood and said that there was no way anyone looked at my engine as there was a build of dust/dirt on the engine cover that was completed untouched and undisturbed.  He continued with his check and said my engine looked completely clean and found no sludge at all.  I took my car to a second auto shop and was told the same thing.  I find it hard to believe that 2, unbiased auto shops, also looking to make money would've said it was clean, if it wasn't.  I also find it hard to believe that anyone looked at my engine yet didn't disturb any dust or leave a smudge or a fingerprint.  Overall, I'm completely dissatisfied and offended.  I feel like they thought I'd be an easy woman to deceive and boy were they wrong.  I might not know much about cars but I know when I'm being taken advantage of.  I explained all of this to one of the service managers and instead of doing the right thing, he offers me a free oil change.  That tells me he knows exactly what's going on and wants to hold on to every penny made, whether legit or otherwise.  I will not be doing any additional business with this dealership.

160,2597,14-Feb-19,"1st issue: Would not honor the internet advertised price.  I ended up paying $2k more (talked them down from almost $4k more)

2nd issue: I was paying cash for the car because insurance paid to replace a totaled car and I was in the middle of refinancing my house and did not want to touch my credit.  They continued to pressure me to finance and kept changing the cash price.  At at least two points they tried to sneak credit check agreements into other paperwork.  

3rd issue: After leaving with the car, I discovered that one of the interior panels (over the passenger seat belt) was loose.  It had been fixed enough to not show on a walkaround and test drive, but the clips underneath were bent and it popped off after one day of driving.

Despite all of that, I would not have written this review.  I got the car I wanted and could afford and was just going to write them off as a shady used car dealer to avoid in the future.  But now, 5 months after my purchase, they still have not applied for my title or registration. I have tried calling and emailing the sales and finance people at the dealership, the corporate office (Morgan Payne who is in charge of titles, and her boss Vic Walker the controller) - no response from anyone, and I'm not able to get through to anyone other than receptionists.  The last person I talked to on the phone once I threatened to complain to the TxDMV explained that the dealer's accounts had been frozen since October and no titles had been applied for at all. So now, I've complained to the DMV and have to wait 15 business days for them to respond, and I MIGHT get a title and plates after that, or I might have to take them to court.

I should have done my homework before giving them my money. I bought a used Nissan in September 2018. It had 20k miles. The finance manager told me that as a condition of our loan, we had to buy the extended warranty. I called the bank the next morning to confirm this and of course, they can not and did not make the requirement, as it is illegal to do so. Shame on me for believing the ""professional."" I called the finance manager, Gerson Gamero and he said that he would send me the cancellation form. I never received it and I called and emailed until I did receive the cancellation form. I sent it back and he never cancelled it. My husband went up there this weekend and spoke to the new finance guy Robert Spivey (since the one we were dealing with no longer works there) and he said he would cancel it...except this is not the full refund that we were promised, it was for half prorated based on the date and mileage. I tried to cancel the warranty that was dishonestly forced on us from the morning after we purchased the car, but he processed it using this weekends date and mileage.
 In addition to all of this, the first finance guy told the car had never been in an accident and showed us the Carfax, which indicated that it had not been.

I would therefore think it should've been better than all the other used car purchase experiences, especially after informing the staff that I am active duty military.  I bought a Hyundai Sonata Hybrid while on deployment in Texas (I live in Montana) and drove it back.  
 - There was hassle at the dealership from the very beginning.  My husband and I got there and they literally COULDN'T FIND THE CAR.  I'm unfortunately not making this up.  We left, and had to return later.  Then there was the issue of pricing.  We worked with Larry Green, almost exclusively.  Not only was he not straightforward or clear in the details, but he kept changing them!  We finally got to finance, and Larry had made that guy look horrible by not doing his job and telling us what we were already supposed to know before getting that far.  We ended up leaving the dealership a SECOND TIME.  They later called me and confirmed that they would indeed honor a military discount and confirmed what the price would be, so we went back a THIRD TIME and finally purchased the car.  While the hassle at the dealership was incredibly annoying, it was nothing compared to what happened afterwards.
 - The dealership never sent the title to the state of Montana, so I still haven't been able to register the car.....over three months later.  I had to pay out of pocket for a secondary temporary plate, after the first expired, call the dealership and tell them how to do their job.  They explained that they'd be overnight mailing the title to the DMV as well as a reimbursement check to me.  I still haven't received that check....over 2 months later.  The very first oil change and tire rotation for the car was cut short because the car has locking lug nuts, and I was never given a key.  I called the dealership again and spoke with the manager, Larry Green, again.  He was incredibly rude and unprofessional, again.  In the end, he supposedly agreed to overnight mail me the locking lug nut key, as well as the reimbursement check I hadn't previously received.  That was over a month ago, and I still haven't received either.  I later reviewed my credit report to find that this guy farmed out my finance application to SIX additional creditors.

-2 weeks later I called the warranty company and nothing had been canceled so I emailed him about it and he said thanks for the reminder.  No apology. 
-I called the following day and was told I was charged a $50 cancellation fee on a warranty I never agreed and I also had to pay taxes on a loan amount that should have been thousands cheaper.

After bouts with the finance dept, I was called by an individual that said he worked in finance at Fenton ( Carlos),( it turned out he really worked for the repo hunters), I told him I would return the vehicle as my first payment was not due, and this did not look like it was a start to a good relationship. He informed me he would have the car picked up so that I would not have to worry about a ride home. He said he would send the necessary paperwork for me to get my down payment back on Monday morning.

I still returned the car, called on Monday ; and was told by Spencer (Finance Mgr) that he would not return my down payment and I would have a repo on my credit.

A month later, we were told that the car desired was not available. We decided to continue with the sale and changed the major thing we liked about the car which was the outside color. 
We were told the car was available and we could get in two days. Almost a week later, and many calls to the salesman, we finally got to see and buy the car.  Not to mention the salesman left before providing us the required temporary car tags. 
We bought extra items that are to be installed by the local parts department. We were advised that we would get a call the next day once the salesman was able to schedule a time with the parts department. We have yet to get that call and the salesman will not return our call. 
I received a call from the front desk that my tags are now in (one month later) and we can come get them. That is great to know. Now when can we get the rest of the items we bought. And not to mention, we have other items we want to add and very unsure we will get them at this location. That will depend on the service from the parts department. 

Needless to say, be cautious when buying a car from this location unless you know you will not need to go back for any follow ups. The top priority for a particular salesperson is to get the sale and move on. This is not the usual reaction after getting a brand new car.

2871,2635,25-Feb-17,"On Friday, February 17, 2017, I was shopping on line for a used vehicle for my family. We needed something bigger because we have foster children. I was able to find a 2016 Chrysler Town and Country Van on the Carfax website at Fenton Hyundai in Mesquite, TX. I called and spoke with a salesperson Edwin Hawkins. He confirmed that the price on Carfax of $18,700 was correct. After driving the vehicle, he called me back and said that it was in pristine condition. Being that we were going to drive 2 hours from Longview, TX to the dealership I wanted to confirm all of this. After my mother-in-law and wife got off of work we drove to the dealership. When we arrived at the dealership they advised us that Mr. Hawkins was busy with another customer and had us work with another salesman.
After checking our credit the dealership advised us that my credit or what we owed on our trade would increase our payment considerably. My mother-in-law agreed to sign on the deal by herself. While in the finance office I wasn’t able to stay with my mother-in-law due to helping my wife with our two tired 2-year-old foster children. I was able to be in the finance office long enough to hear the finance man John Davis say that he and several other employees of the Fenton Hyundai in Oklahoma were brought to Mesquite. He said the Oklahoma dealership was the number one Hyundai dealership in Oklahoma and they were brought to Mesquite to straighten out the Mesquite dealership.
On Saturday, February 18, 2017, my mother-in-law asked me to look over the paperwork on the deal. I looked at the 3 pages she received and first of all thought on a car deal that there should be more pages. The papers stated that the total amount financed was over $26,000. I thought this was more than it should be for a vehicle costing $18,700, even with tax, title, and license. We had nothing stating the actual price of the vehicle or any itemization of the charges.
That evening I called and spoke with the finance man. He stated that the price of the vehicle was over $21,000. I was connected with a Mr. Bustos and he told me that he would look into it and assured me that he would call me before he left that evening. 
On Monday, February 19, 2017, I called back and spoke with Phil the general sales manager, who I still don’t know his last name. After speaking with him he said I can’t speak with you due to privacy laws because your mother-in-law signed the papers. I questioned this because the staff of the dealership didn’t mind talking to me Saturday night. Phil stated that we could bring the vehicle back during this conversation. He also said that this deal didn’t make any money so he wasn’t willing to refinance with the $18,700 price. 
Later that same day I spoke with Phil again. As I was talking to him he handed over the phone to the manager that was working on Friday night when we bought the vehicle. I don’t remember his name. He stated to resolve this he would ask permission from his General Manager the next day and get us a $1500 check when he returns from being out of town. He said that Mr. Hawkins wasn’t there that day to verify if he told me the $18,700 price. 
After speaking with my mother-in-law, she wasn’t happy with the deal that he offered. She said that the $1500 wouldn’t change anything or change the price. She decided that she wanted to return the vehicle unless the dealership was willing to redo the deal at the $18,700 price. When I called the manager back that offered the $1500 deal. He said I thought this was settled and began to refuse to speak to me anymore. I said we are going to just bring the vehicle back. He said if you bring the vehicle back he would report it as a repo. He said he was going to let “corporate” speak to me.
I called Phil back and told him that after speaking to my mother-in-law we had decided to bring the vehicle back. Phil then told me that we couldn’t bring the vehicle back. I questioned him as to why he was telling me we couldn’t bring it back when he said earlier in the day that we could bring it back. Phil the general sales manager began to get frustrated and began to yell at me. He said that “I don’t care about this car deal. I will sell numerous other vehicles.” He also said during his rage, “I don’t know what kind of hillbilly math you use in that town where you’re from but your wrong.”
I finally spoke to the General Manager David Pattel on Wednesday, February 21, 2017. He said he’ll look into it and call me back. I finally spoke to him after calling him the next day when I didn’t receive a call back. He offered me a $1000 check and said that was what he was told that his staff had told him they offered me. I said no they offered me $1500. He said we can’t bring back the vehicle but we can come back and trade it in and get another vehicle. Why would we want to make another deal with this dealership when the first one went like it did? 
So, he is supposed to be sending someone with the check and paperwork this Monday or Tuesday. We are still not satisfied with this money. I feel that this is just hush money to make us drop this and not take it any further.

I arrived just before 8 and drove right in and a service writer was talking on the phone, and helped me after getting off. I told him about appointment for recall.

I asked to speak to parts after making the appointment, as I have written service at a few dealerships, to make sure the part was available. The service writer was checking on recall and wondered what engine it had as that would matter for the recall. I know the VIN gives a person the engine size. After calling to check on it at 11:30, he wasn't 'available', and no one else could tell me if it was ready. After calling back to have someone else get in the Adams OS to check if parts or labor had been billed out, No one could tell me, which is no right and bad customer service. After calling back within thirty minutes to speak to service manager, he was 'in a meeting', my service writer called saying the recall was completed.

2901,2668,18-Jul-19,"Was shopping for CPO Genesis.......
STRIKE 1. Made appointment to see two cars (2016 Genesis) - Got there and was told they were not in inventory and they didn't know that until I was waiting to see the cars.  
-Was told another one just came in (matching my criteria) - was at Plano Huffines and could be brought up (was not in inventory yet and had not been made ready)  no problem.  
Liked the car and bought it on Saturday (6-8-19).  I bought a protection package for interior and exterior, extended service warranty and window tinting (which was given for no cost (thank you) .  Car would be ready Thursday (time to fix minor body damage and cracked windshield, put tint on windows and apply the interior and exterior protection products)
-Picked the car up Thursday and drove home- pretty excited...these are nice cars and this had all the bells and whistles and looked sharp

STRIKE 2. Noticed the driver seat was dirty (seats are almost white) - I saw the smudges and dirtiness (not bad, but noticeable)  when I first looked at the car, but thought it odd that this wasn't cleaned up when they readied the car and applied the protection package.
I then looked under the hood (should have done this prior to buying...stupid me) - the engine compartment was VERY dirty with leaves, dust and debris .  Took pictures (which I wish I could include here) and sent to the sales person (Jerry Blow) .  Told me in email ""The engine compartments are not detailed due to the risk of water damage to components""
I then told him about the dirty seat - he then said the ""Smart Shield"" was not applied and I should bring it back at my convenience.  Glad I asked.....This package is a bit pricey for what it is.  How was this overlooked?????

STRIKE 3 - THIS IS A BIG ONE-  I bought this car at a Hyundai dealership specifically to get a Certified Pre Owned (CPO) vehicle .  I was given a brochure telling me how great the CPO program was with nearly 173 inspection points.   
Because of the dustiness / dirtiness of the engine compartment something really stuck out.  Did they even check the air filter????  This filter is a pain to inspect- there is a bar across it that had to be removed ( bolts on either end) and there was no sign in the dust that it had been touched, let alone inspected.  Surely this is on the CPO checklist
I looked into the CPO process further and discovered that before the car can be CPO approved, there is a comprehensive checklist that must be completed and signed by 4 authorized people- technician who did the checks, the service manager, the CPO program manager and finally the customer.   THIS WAS NOT DONE and, until I dug into it, I did not know this was a key document in the sales process!!!!!!!!!  
                                        How did it get CPO certified and sold without this being done
                                                            TALK ABOUT LOSING ALL TRUST

- I brought the car back for the Smart Shield application and a complete CPO inspection - they had the car for a couple of days and provided a NC loan vehicle.  Got the car back and signed the CPO document (Service Manager was very attentive and professional - (Tony Saif) 

STRIKE 4 - It's been 6 weeks since I bought the car.  Thought it was odd that I had not gotten my plates / registration.  
Called yesterday (7-17-19) to get status update.  Oh! the car should have been inspected when it up there last time- I could bring back there or go somewhere locally and they would reimburse me the cost of the inspection.  
NO PAPERWORK WAS SUBMITTED because of this - no call, email or text telling me they dropped the ball again.  What the heck......

I was actually pretty mad and was going to contact Mr. Huffines to let him know the bevy of problems and mistakes at this dealership, but my wife advised me to 1st call the sales manager to see if he was aware of the problems, etc associated with this sale.  Called and (as he would not be in till the afternoon), requested he (Ben Hagan) call me back.  NO CALL BACK.  Did he get the message ???- super nice guy , but .........

After buying my new 2017 Hyundai Accent at another dealer, I went to the Hyundai dealership at McKinney on 06/28/2017 for procuring a spare tire kit (Part number 1R40-AC900) as Hyundai does not provide one. The dealer charged me a total of $319.31 ($272.00 for the kit and tire, $20.00 for mounting the tire to the rim and $22.81 Tax). I was told that I would have to pay a charge of $20.00 for the mounting the tire to the rim of the spare kit. The purchase of the spare tire kit should include the mounting of the tire. Last year, I purchased a spare tire kit (invoice number 51189 dated 06/23/2016) at Fenton Hyundai at Mesquite, TX for my new 2016 Hyundai that I had purchased at another dealer . At that time the Fenton Hyundai charged me a total of $270.63 ($250.00 for the tire kit including tire and tax of $20.63). There was no charge for mounting of the tire on the rim. I still have the bill for that purchase. You will observe how much more that the dealer at McKinney charged me as compared the dealer at Mesquite.

2904,2672,06-May-17,I had purchased a 2014 Cadenza from Tony mcloud. It was late in the evening. Was not able to see the Hail Damage on the car. Our insurance company came out to look at the car as we added the car The day before. They advised us that the car had pre existing hail damage and if it hailed the insurance will only cover 70% of the damages. The next day took the car back and showed it to manager Kevin and was told to go ahead and make appointment with Tony to bring the car in so they will take care of it. Absolutely no problem . Tony didn't give me an appointment until Monday and that Sunday it hailed really bad in McKinney and the car was damaged a lot so insurance only gave us 70% of the claim.  Called Tony mcloud and he advised he will speak to Kevin and get back to me. So he called and left a voicemail stating no problem we will take care of it just bring us what the insurance paid and they will take care of the rest. Asked me to bring the car there drop it off along with the cash.  I dropped the car off along with cash. Hour later Kevin called and stated before you go get the rental to stop by so I did. When I got there he said his paintless guys can repair the car but it will not be very good job. So the car really needed to go to the body shop to get it done right. And he will talk to his body shop and take care of it. It's been over a month and I haven't heard anything back. I will get the car fixed and pay out of my pocket over $1500.  Which I shouldn't have to as Tony left a voicemail stating they will take care of it. But never did I am leaving this review because my experience stated with them really great but there words absolutely meant nothing. I still have that voicemail saved.

2930,2704,27-Aug-19,"I bought recently a used car from this dealership because of their attractive rates. However, I had bad experience in terms of how the overall my purchase experience went. 

I’m felt misguided and deceived after the purchase. First of all, I was told by the sales agent that this particular car was Certified however, while signing the documents the Finance manager revealed that its just certification “ready” and I’ll have to pay extra if I need certificate in hand. I wonder why the website as well as sales agent mentioned it being a Certified car! BS#*#*}*}*

By the time we were started viewing this car, it was dark and neither sales agent nor I could find a glass chip on the car’s windshield. I found it the very next day. I usually don’t worry about such chips but this particular one was right in front of driver’s seat. This is a purely safety-hazard as it creates split-view whenever there is a car right in front of you. I would have expected any used car to reveal this kind of information upfront - which was missing in this case. This is another instance of mis guidance. Problem is, even after visiting your dealership (hoping they will take care of this and fix it by replacing the windshield)- this dealership showed very absurd response to a recent buyer - folks were laughing with the problem that I reported; their managers were like “sorry boss,now its your car, we cannot do anything now”! I felt so miserable thinking how these same guys were lurking behind me before selling the car and after then after the purchase totally new side of this dealership.

Another concern I had - this particular vehicle was so dirty but I was told the appropriate detail will be done at later point. However, later I was told that only wash will be done and even they cannot honor what they said. I don’t understand how a dealership can back-out for these quality measures - especially first time buyer!

I can't remember the name of the guy who had helped me but he flat out lied to my face. First he told me that fees and licensing would cost around $1000 even though its usually around $500. Then he told me the car I drove 45 mins to check out was sold already. Then he tried to sell me another car that was at a higher price, and during negotiations he kept wasting time and saying give me 5 mins to talk to the manager then come back 20 mins later.

Today I decided something was not right about yesterdays visit so I called the dealership and checked on the car I originally wanted and guess what? It was available and I even scheduled a test drive for tomorrow. I really don't mind if service was bad or slow but lying to your customer just to make more money is unforgivable.",1,60,0,0

WE made an appointment with Sean in service dept. He picked the time and date based on when a loaner car would be available. WE were thinking because he picked the date and time there should be no problems. WERE WE WRONG, first thing Tami (our service advisor) says is there isn't a loaner car and none were on computer for us. She wanted to know how we scheduled the service. I told her I called in and ordered service and needed loaner. Again she referred to computer stating there were none available and DID NOT  try to offer any suggests as to how to remedy our situation.

WE called in and did our part.  We, as were promised to receive the great service from GENESIS and get there and to find a back woods and unprofessional service dept.  Seems as though if they don't see it in the computer it doesn't exist.  WE did not purchase car from computer we did not schedule service with computer; we did it with employees of ROUNDROCK HYUNDAI and  WE hold them accountable for errors. 

I was told by the service manager they were NEVER going to service my car and take it someplace else. WE expect what was promised and what we PAID for, IS THAT TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR.  When you purchase a top of the line vehicle you expect top of the line service. NOT BOTTOM OF THE BARREL.",1,61,0,0

Learned from the service tech that my error code was for a catalytic converter issue that is a ""known problem"".  Read up on the internet that many owners have had mixed reviews about this low standard of design from Infiniti.  Service rep told me Infiniti's warranty covers it, but my ""third party"" warranty they pushed on me in the finance department was hardly ever sold and didn't cover this repair at all.  I was shown a  pamphlet for the warranty and not the laminated sheet that has items not covered.  Had I seen that, my husband who is a hobby advanced level mechanic would have rejected it right off.  I don't know why I wasn't shown that particular layout, but I feel very disgusted with their finance department and with Infiniti for even putting that 3rd party warranty out there.  Don't buy the third party extended warranty.  The finance man told me it covered everything except normal wear and tear parts like tires and batteries and brakes.  That was a generalization and a lie.  I'm really disgusted.  I researched the code issue and found that if maintained properly (archoil 6400-g fuel additive every so often), a catalytic converter will maintain proper operating function.  I bought  a bottle on the internet for $18, added it per instructions and ran almost a quarter tank of gas and the error code disappeared.  Infiniti was ready to replace my catalytic converter off the bat for $2300.00.  Just like that.

I live 70 miles from Lithia so I took it to the Dodge house near me.  First off, the car did not have the lug key.  In order to check the tire, they had to take the tire off.  Not possible without the key.  So I called Lithia and told them my problem.  I spoke to one of the 2 salesmen (Tyler) who had made my sale.  I was told the car sold ""as is"" and he was very sorry, but could not help.  So I paid the dealer near me $65 to break off the lugs.  They discovered that the tire had been patched and air was leaking around the patch, and that I would need a new tire.... to the tune of $270.  I called Lithia and spoke to a manager (Michael) and explained my problem.  He too said, the car sold ""as is"" and ""sorry"" they could not help me.  My total bill was $437.45.  Lithia ""certified"" the car before I drove it off the lot.  Doesn't that mean they checked it out?  Doesn't it mean they should have at least noticed that I did not have a lug key?  I even think they should have discovered that the tire could not hold air.  The car I bought was a 2018 Dodge Charger with 19,900 miles on it.  I am very UN happy with customer service.

3030,2818,03-Dec-18,"My brothers dodge caravan was towed in on October 28th because it had no power. Our service consultant was Charles. Communication between Charles and us was about as minimal as you can get. Unless we called him we could never get any information. The vehicle is a 2017 Dodge Caravan with a full bumper to bumper extended warranty mind you. On November 13th we were told that the warranty would not cover anything on the vehicle and we would need to pay the entire $5000+ service bill before we could take the van. When asked how this could be Charles told us ""because your warranty refused to cover the repairs"". I contacted the warranty company to inquire why this was. So on or about the 8th of November they (the warranty company) sent out an inspector who took pictures of everything but couldn't approve the needed repairs because the mileage couldn't be validated. They needed the van to power up to verify that we were within the mileage to approve.  So IPAC did the repair and the warranty company sent out a 2nd inspector to approve the completed repairs. When the 2nd inspector got there and he inspected the vehicle he could tell that the repairs that IPAC said they did, they didn't do. So they refused the repairs and that's when they tried to get us to pay for them. After almost another 2 weeks back and forth with IPAC and the warranty company come to find out IPAC never did the repairs they were trying to charge us and warranty company for. They told us that the service tech had lied to all of us about completed repairs. Today is December 3rd. we have been without a vehicle for over a month because they were dishonest.

If you want your vehicle to be well serviced and taken care of DO NOT take it to IPAC, in fact I would recommend you not buy any of their warranties to prevent their horrible service. The other day my cars engine randomly seized. I took it to the manufacturers dealership to get a full diagnostic and they found that our vehicle was 2 quarts OVER the recommended amount which they concluded caused the engine to fail. They could not find anything else wrong with the car besides that. We checked oil change records and IPAC had been adding way more then required for the last 2 or 3 oil changes. I've heard that their service department DOES NOT care for vehicles properly but gave them the benefit of the doubt... When you take your car in for service you expect the service to be made exactly what is required, nothing more nothing less and it's obvious that doesn't happen at IPAC. To make matters worse when we confronted them about the issue they told us that they MIGHT be able to cover a measly 20% of the damages but before that they had to escalate the situation to management. Two weeks pass by and I'm told employee that IPAC will not help with the repairs after all and that it was my fault because I should have checked to see that the service was properly done. I was also told that if I knew the car didn't require that much oil then I should have made a special request to get the correct oil amount and oil filter on my vehicle...I was never given the opportunity to speak to a customer relations person or a manager.

In December I had my car serviced due to every time it rained water would leak thru the roof leaving a stain and the smell of mildew. When I called it was my understanding it was under the manufacturer's warranty but was told they wouldn't work on it right away so I decided to bring it after the holidays. When I dropped off the vehicle it was suddenly over the manufacturers warranty and they made me pay out of pocket. Then when I picked up the vehicle I noticed a huge scratch on the door. I told the worker that scratch was not there and took a picture of it right in front of him. He tried to say it wasn't a scratch but if it was I could call and bring it back. Well I called and they told me to send an email to chernandez@ipacchrysler.com. Never got a single response. Called back again and was told to send an email to the head of the service department jwilde@ipacchrysler.com. After serval more emails still no response. I just want the scratch fixed.

Looks like I am just reiterating what everyone else has experienced at this dealership but here we go.
After inquiring (via ramtrucks.com) I was called by the dealership (Judy) and setup an appointment.  I drove an hour to make my appointment on time and on schedule showing the respect for their time that I expect to be shown for mine.  I was introduced to Judy (gatekeeper) and was quickly assigned to one of the hoard of salesmen that stared lustily at any potential victim who drove into the parking lot.  It was strikingly reminiscent of a combination of ""The Walking Dead"" and picking up day laborers in the HomeDepot parking lot.

I was then informed that the particular unit I had inquired about, being the only unit that met MOST of my requirements and all of my preferences, was unavailable as they were lifting it and putting oversized tires on it.  Since I am simple man who has come to terms with my stature, hairline, and masculinity I had no need of a lifted truck.  

I was at this point very incensed asked why I had been invited to drive an hour for no particular purpose.  The salesman assured me they had lots of units that would meet my needs even though he had no clue what those were.  He invited me to get into his vehicle and wander through their remote lot looking at random trucks.  I then recommended we complete a computer search of their stock with my particular requirements.  He was a confused by my idea of using tools to expedite the process and insisted we go wandering about in hopes of stumbling across something that might interest me.
At this point I was done with them and walked away.  I was glad I still had my keys and could make a speedy get away before the minions revolted and feasted upon brains.",1,65,0,0

My Chrysler 300 2019 It’s only six months old so to my surprise the visit Indicated that my Calais converter was going out on my brand new car. I could not receive an appointment that day so they scheduled me forService when my parts came in. So November 1st parts come in and i take it back up there they do the work and i pick the car up. Get home the light comes back on. I call they say they don’t do service on the weekends and I’ll have to bring it back Monday. I bring it back on Monday and they informed me that they ordered and changed the wrong part and that they would have to order the correct part and try again and keep in mind i told them i was due at work in Pennsylvania on November 3rd. They informed me that the parts are going to take couple days to come in and that there’s nothing that they can do and I just have to be patient. Needless to say i lost my job position. Today is November 8th and i finally finish. On top of that the only way you find out any information about your Vehicle is the call because nobody calls nobody relays messages you have to keep calling calling calling calling so you can speak to someone because the service department does not call back and does not update you on your vehicle at all.

I was informed by Johnathan that the tire could not be repaired and that I needed to buy a brand new tire that cost $170. I refused and asked for them to put the tire back on. I picked up my car with out any issues, so I thought. Fast forward to Wednesday 6/3, my tire started to lose pressure again and I took it to a tire shop. When they asked me for the key to the rims, I went in the glove compartment where the mechanic left it and there was no key in the container. I went to the dealership immediately and was told by Jonathan that I needed to come back Thursday morning so that the Manager can order new parts. I arrived this morning at 0830. About 20 minutes later. Johnathan gave me a new set and said that they match the ones I have on my car even after I asked him was he sure. I left and went straight to the tire shop and waited 2 hours for them to tell me the key didn’t match. I went back to the dealership very upset and crying hysterically when I was told I needed to leave my car and it would be a few hours. The only person that came to calm me down was a sales rep that actually sold me my car, Jaron. I received the rental at 1230 and I didn’t get my car back until 1630. I asked to speak with the manager and when I spoke with him he just looked at me as if I was speaking a different language. I expressed to him everything that happened and that this was the worse customer service I have ever experienced. He just nodded his head and said ok without an apology. My parents referred me to the dealership and I referred my niece but I will no longer do business or refer anyone else to the dealership. This was a big inconvenience and very time consuming.

Things had to be taken out and whatnot. When I finally picked it up, I checked the summary and inspected my truck as I always do. Things usually line up. This time they did not. The summary stated a 13 mile road test had been done. But 80 miles were put on the odometer, half a tank of fuel had been burned, and the took of my black truck had white paint rubbed on top. Only caused by running through a clearance that is too low. Joyride or whatever you wanna call it. I went back inside before driving at all and confronted the service advisor staff, including the manager at the last desk. They agreed that i was right about what it looked like. Unfortunately, they shrugged it off as an “oh well, xxxx happens” moment. Said nothing could be done for me since neither Gary, the diesel tech, nor the reimbursement guy were there. And that I could go back the next day if I wanted to be reimbursed for the fuel. I told them that I didn’t care about the $30 fuel reimbursement and that I wondered if that there were anything that could be done to convince me to keep my service here, if they cared about it. Once again I was met with blank stares. I’ve got a 2017 Cummins and a 2014 Charger and I would buy all my parts here and get any service I couldn’t do myself here. Now i’ll Go out of my way to river oaks or Dickinson. Wherever I can find decent service without my truck being someone’s toy. I would’ve given 0 stars, but Gary was very helpful. Called at every step of the process and left a detailed message if I didn’t answer. ",1,66,0,0

3166,2962,08-May-19,I purchased a challenger I thought was the Hemi alll along that Stressfully asked over and over its the hemi its the hemi and they said yes. That’s one. Then I just a few days ago I went to get my tires checked because the tires in the back rammed out from the inner part of the tires and all they did was rotated only. Now my car goes side ways and unbalanced. ,1,66,0,0
3167,2963,30-Apr-19,So I got a service with tire rotation done. A day later my tire sensor went out so I called to schedule an appointment.  I went in a week later on a scheduled day. They wanted me to leave my vehicle just to troubleshoot the sensor as if anyone has the luxury of just leaving a vehicle.  After an hour and a half of walking around outside i went in and tried to get an update from Steve. That arrogant jerk ignored me and acted as if i was not in front of him taking a call just pushing me off. But as soon as a young woman walked in the door he was quick to hang up and try to bend over backwards for her. So i asked that someone else help. Got the update from Luis. He came back and said the tech cleared the code and drove my truck 3 miles to see if the sensor would reset. I was worried because I have the progressive snapshot plugged in so I checked it. The logged report said the vehicle was on for about 2 minutes and that was when they moved it to the back. I asked how did they drive it if it was only on 2 minutes and I was outside the whole time never saw the truck leave. They could not answer. They said they fixed the sensor and let me go. A day later the fault code came back on and now they wont return my call so I can schedule another service. I will not recommend gulfgate dodge for any service other than a basic oil change. And not even for that. ,1,66,0,0

3173,2969,26-Mar-19,"I purchased my previous vehicle (2015 Chrysler 200) from her in 2015 and my salesperson at that time was Tyrone (he is so awesome).  I knew I was in need of another car (high mileage) and Juana called me about a special deal that was going on at the dealership so I decided to go in.

Juana was very patient, kind, empathic, and was listened to my every need.  I advised her of my budget and she worked hard at trying to get me the deal that I wanted; however she wasn’t successful.  She asked if I could meet with one of her managers about making a deal for me that I would be willing to compromise with and I agreed.

One of the managers, Alexis, approached me and advised me of two options that I had.  After I explained to him that neither option would work, he offered some unethical suggestions (i.e. stop paying on my current vehicle and just make payments on the new car) for me to consider so that he could make the deal.  He also stated that it really wouldn’t matter if I stop making payments on my car because my credit wasn’t the best (my credit is fair).  When I refused to follow suite, he returned back to his office to see if there were other options for me to consider.  At this point, I was irritated, frustrated, and overall disrespected at the horrible customer service I received from someone who is a manager.  I asked Juana for my keys and my id because I was ready to go and she obliged my request.

She walked me to my car and I advised Juana that it wasn’t her that I had an issue with, it was Alexis and the way he treated me (I did use a few choice words about my feelings and experience with the manager).  I explained to her that I didn’t like how he spoke to me, how he approached me with the deal, and how he attempted to belittle me about the decision that I was making towards the deal.  I told her that I did have a positive outlook on this place; however it has changed with me working with him.  She acknowledged my feelings and respected my decision.

Once I was getting ready to leave, another sales person approved me, Armando, who overheard some of the conversation that I had with Juana.  I explained to him the interaction that I had with Alexis and how I refused to be treated like that from someone who wants my business and that it was best for me to leave.  He acknowledged my feelings as well and provided his professional opinion about the deal. 

After leaving the dealership and evaluating my decision, I contacted Juana and was able to make a compromise (where I didn’t have to deal with Alexis) regarding the sale of the vehicle.  I was able to make my purchase and not interact with that manager in the process.  I was able to leave the dealership with what I wanted, which worked out at the end.

If it wasn’t for Tyrone, Juana, Armando, and Ms. Denise (in finance), I wouldn’t recommend this dealership nor would I have purchased my car from here again.  My suggestion would be to offer Alexis to attend customer service training, respect customers’ decisions, morals, and ethical beliefs, don’t approach deals with unethical recommendations, and be cognitive of the words that are being used when he is communicating with customers.

3181,2979,04-Feb-19,"My friend and I went in to Gulfgate a few weeks ago to look at a preowned vehicle. I had called ahead to tell them what we saw online and to have the vehicle ready for us to look at and they gave us the name of a salesman to speak with when we arrived. We arrived at the dealership and the salesman was busy so we were then told to speak with Anwar, who never actually introduced himself as I had to ask for his name after we left. We looked at the car and automatically didn’t like it because it was a smokers vehicle and then looked at another and test drove it. As we got into the car to test drive, the manager saw us in the vehicle with the salesman and said, “This looks like a crime waiting to happen. A white man, a black man, and two asian girls.” I could not believe that racist remark came out of the manager’s mouth but we just ignored it at the time.  The vehicle we test drove was an Infiniti and the salesman knew nothing about the vehicle but the obvious features. We brought up seat warmers and he didn’t even know if the car had them and brushed it off like nothing. We got back from the test drive and talked about the car and ultimately decided it was not the perfect car so we weren’t going to try and buy the vehicle and when we said we didn’t like something about the car, the salesman was very rude with his responses. I did not like the fact that the vehicle was a rental and had many drivers in and out of the vehicle and the salesman gave us strong attitude when I said that and said, “Well what are you expecting with a used car?” Then the disrespectful salesman thanked us for wasting his time and then asked if we would talk to his manager so he “wouldn’t get in trouble”. We went and talked to the racist manager who was slightly nicer, although he questioned our opinions on the vehicle and that was very disrespectful and uncouth as that just made the situation worse. When we specifically told the manager we wanted seat warmers, he said, “Really? Seat warmers in Texas?” Ironically is was 40 degrees that morning. So then we left and went on our two hour journey home as we came from out of town. The next day my friend realized she couldn’t find her license and wondered if the salesman had given it back we he made a copy for the test drive. Well I call and turns out he left the license in the copy machine so we asked if they would mail it back as we live two hours out of town. They said they would and almost two weeks later she still hadn’t received her license. So I call again a week later after them not answering the phone once and they said they still have the license and will send it out soon. Well she finally got it one and a half weeks later after that phone call with no sort of explanation or apology.

After I told him I was not going to pay more than the advertised price, he got his manager.  His manager confirmed that he would not sell the car for less than the elevated warranty price.

After the director's departure, I continued discussions with Jaron, I expressed my displeasure of the bait and switch tactic.  Jaron began to tell me I was a bad consumer because if I didn't pay the elevated price I was preventing him from supporting his daughter.  This was the absolute worst sales tactic I have ever seen.

I waited for around 10 mins and was greeted by an extremely fine person Mr.Raul. I had to explain and give the stock number specifically which I have come for. He was unable to find the stock and said in that case the car might be in workshop. I was a bit surprised a car which was in Stock for Sale for 43 days is in workshop. I requested him to verify. After 10 mins he came back with a ""Sorry message that the car is Sold the previous day."" I was amazed. I said but your dealership is Closed on Saturdays. Then he said the Sales Person sold the car on Friday and did the Delivery on Saturday. I was Extremely Disappointed with the False Information and sheer headache of travelling 20miles to hear this crap. I said can I meet the Manager. I went with him and the Manager said he will come in sometime. I waited more than 15 mins. Then another person Jimmy informed the Manager again. After 10 mins I was asked to go to his desk. There the fun starts. I told him the list of events and I was shocked to hear his response. Here I quote George Nabbout "" We do not update the inventory so frequently in the Website/Internet. Moreover these inventory may may not be there but once the Customer is here then we try to sell whatever inventory we have. These Internet Inventory & Pricing is to Attract Customers"". I asked why dont you put ""Pending Sale"" , he said since our inventory is too low it does not make to update every minute by minute Inventory status . For him it meant its fine to give incorrect information to Customers as they are to attract Customers. I was Super Upset. I was thinking what crap dealership , what is the difference between roadside Dealerships and these big branded ones. Then I thought to come back to get his name for Review. When I came , obviously I was frustrated , I said "" Your names please"" , he said ""george"" , can you please give me the full name. Then he gave me his Business Card. Then I was leaving & he called ""excuse me"" and said in extremely rude manner "" why are you giving me such a ""f*** o**"" look & some more derogatory words"" I said back. I don't think I ever said those words nor my action prompted those behavior, I requested you to speak outside so that there is no scene amongst your customers & subordinates just in case you are a Manager."" His words"" I have nothing to hide , I have 4 College Degress, and from your appearance it seems you are also educated college degrees & .....( that I have means & resources). I dont know how many years you are in this country but I am here for 30 years & lot of jibber jabber.."" . I said again ""I have not done anything derogatory nor shouted nor raised my voice unlike you are ,  yes I am very upset and angry and I feel cheated because of wrong information which for you was super casual as it is your part of normal business cycle"". Then he said ""Yes that specific deal was a steal , i know $13000, 11k miles Altima , anybody will grab for it. I dont think you will die if you dont get that car today. I am sure this probably is going to be 2nd or 3rd car just because its a steal deal. If you want I can call you once we have such cars and miles & you can come."" I actually was super upset with his way of behaviour , I left my name and number. But inside I was sure never to visit this dealership ever.  And the best part , all time he was sitting in his chair , there was not even a chair for the Customer . Hence I was standing & he was blabbering sitting. Being in a Customer Service industry I really feel pity for him. He is really lucky to have a very good Manager else by now I would have fired him , a very can be very good at his target n numbers but a person with wrong attitude can spoil the name & create a bad atmosphere for other team members & the organization Goals.. I feel extremely sad for this Organization & Leaders .. My advice , DO NOT visit the dealership directly if you have some stock seen over the internet. Speak with a Sales Person & verify if the stock # & price is there. I saw some Google Reviews where few have complained that , they even has bumped up the price & did not honor website pricing. There seems to be an integrity issue with this dealership , hence visit at your own risk & luck. This happened specific to ""Pre Owned Car"" Division.",1,66,0,0

3205,3006,19-Sep-18,"In late May, another dealership (Bayway Dodge) replaced a computer part. They told me they replaced the TIPM. They actually replaced the PCM, but more on that later. Immediately after the repair, my car started acting horribly. After a bad experience at Bayway, I took my car to Gulfgate.

I let them know that Bayway replaced a computer part, and the part was most likely bad because the problem started happening immediately after the part was replaced. Instead of immediately checking the service history on my car to verify what I told them, they took 2 months to verify. They saw that the PCM was replaced, not the TIPM. This is a fact that could have been cleared up on Day 1 with proper communication. 
My car spent over 2 months at the dealership. When I would call, they would promise to give me a call back in 30 minutes, that afternoon, etc. Often it would take several days or over a week to get a call back.

Chris showed us several models and then convinced us to go inside and look at inventory and see if he could get us a good deal given it was mother's day and there was an extra $1k rebate. Found a white a 2017 Limited but they didn’t have it (although site said they had 6). Asked to price a JGC High Altitude. We submitted info to look at numbers. Sales Manager Mike Chapa came and gave us initial numbers with rates possibly less than 5%. At one point we mentioned just looking at numbers and weren’t thinking of buying...Mike immediately pushed his chair back and was about to stand up to leave when I stopped him and said we were discussing numbers. Obviously our time was not worth his. At that moment I advised them that the info on the sheet was not correct as we were interested in the white JGC and not the red JGC. Mike pulled up the correct information and notated all the rebates and said no worries its about the same so it’s fine. We had asked for a lower rate so he went back again. When he came back we again discussed rates but also advised him that we could get a better rate with our bank. He said ok and that he would re-verify rebates. He left again. At this time Chris (who has been more than awesome throughout this whole thing) comes and tells us Mike had agreed to the price and since our bank was closed they would let us sign the paper with the agreed amount, take the vehicle and then come back during the week to finalize the transaction. Chris advised that the $1k rebate for Mother’s Day had not been added and I also advised that I didn’t feel comfortable signing without the correct vehicle information being listed. He went back to have everything corrected only to have Mike come back and tell us the price was now $3k more because they realized there was a difference. My husband told him we had identified from the beginning which vehicle we were looking at and that he stated it was about the same but he stated he never said such a thing. Needless to say we walked out only to be called later by Mike, who left a voicemail, stating they would do the deal at the price we agreed but yet when we called back Chris tells us Mike told him to tell us they would do it for $4400 more. Tried speaking to Mike the next day; he tried blaming Chris for everything but I corrected him and told him Chris was not at fault; he began to yell and then hung up on me.

He stated he would look further into it, take a look at the numbers and would call back within 45mins...it’s been 2 days and no call back. Overall Chris was great; invested his time on us even though we weren’t completely sure we’d be buying that day.

The absolute WORST place to purchase a vehicle. The staff doesn't communicate, managers don't return calls and don't take your concerns seriously, oh and how could I forget DON'T APPRECIATE YOUR BUSINESS. 

Andrew Cordova, GM? Hm, you couldn't get the GM to answer the phone even if your life depended on it.

The Finance guy in Used Cars, Ryan? I don't know which habit it worst, lying or not returning people's calls.

Our Salesman Mike? How could I forget! He forgot us after we purchased our used vehicle. Dodging calls after making excuse after excuse. 

Christian in Used Sales? Pathetic Car Salesman who is dumbfounded at any and all questions.

My husband and I walked into that dealership with a trade in and put our application in with Ryan to drive out with a 17' Dually and a 15' Charger. Well, turns out all we got was the xxxxing run around. We were told approval for both of the vehicles THEN we were told only the charger but that he could FOR SURE get us into the SLT 2500 buuuut the next day told us that we couldn't get into it despite his promise SO he told us we could get into a car as long as it was under $35000 SO we pick a 17' Jeep for 31,9 and even with a co-signer this guy promised he could get me in it and even let me drive it off the lot. 4 days later (mind you, they never called us to update us) we call and call to get a hold of someone and when we do (Christian) he informed us that we were approved and in the single digits. GREAT RIGHT!? No. We called later on the way up there and he informed us that he was misinformed and I wasn't approved. I was pissed. After sitting in that lobby for 5 hours Thursday, which have Salesman running around cussing and not acting professional while I have my toddler with me I was ready to be done. I am waiting for a gift card currently that we were advertised and promise up until signing when everyone decided to not even return our calls, not like they did in the first place. I have been waiting for about 3 weeks now. It is advertised and promised at signing but yet no one will acknowledge our xxxxty customer service, unbeknownst to them, right? Wrong. My husband has reached out to Mr. Cordova and let me tell you that this man can't return a call if your life depended on it. 

The dealership is flawed to say the least but the real crack in the foundation comes down to the staff. 

Don't waste your time. Don't waste the trip because all you'll get is disappointment and empty promises from incompetent Salesman just making a buck.

I purchased a 2017 Chevrolet equinox  07/06/2017 and the advertised sale price online was $19,800. When I got home, I realized the sale price on the contract said $22,800 which is $3000 above the Internet price. The next day I called the dealership and let them know why was the sale price change from $19,800 to $22,800 and they stated because there was a mandatory warranty that I had to purchase. I advised them that I didn't want that warranty and they told me it was mandatory or else they weren't going to be able to honor the Internet price. I let them know that they can't force me to purchase a warranty or service contract if I don't want to and they simply stated that it was too late I already agreed and signed the contract. I know it was my fault for not verifying the numbers on the contract but this dealership operates with deceptive practices in order to increase their profits and they hide everything from you and just make you sign really quick. By law warranties are free and service contract should be charged as a separate line item on the contract instead of increasing the sale price of the vehicle.

I told him I needed it fixed but he said it would be difficult to complete in a weeks time, I'm not sure why that matters but I said that's fine I will take it to the dealership near my house.

I asked if they could even do the Oil change and replace the run light that was out?
With an attitude he passed me off to the guy who handles the Oil Change.

Later I returned to pick up my car, and I opened the hood to look over the engine and check the oil dip stick.
I noticed the clip that holds my windshield wiper fluid in place was broken!

I went back in to ask the service guy to take a look and I was told he was in a meeting and I would need to wait 15 mins. So I walked back to the office where the meeting was being held, walked in and said excuse me there is a part broken on my car and I need him to come look at it. 

The Manager said who are you I responded with I am a customer and walked back to the car.

the manager and the sales guy along with 4 other guys followed me to the car and looked it over.
The Manager started to have a big Attitude! He tried to talk down to me and I butted in and said ""Sir knock off the Attitude, Right Now!""

The Manager did not even notice I said anything.

So I waited till he was done and said ""Whats with the Attitude?""

He just looked at me. So I repeated ""why do you have an attitude?""

He said ""I am going to look this part up"" and left.

He returned 5 mins later and started raising his voice again and I said STOP having an Attitude Right Now!
He paused and said I'm sorry, it has been a crazy morning, I have ordered the part and we will fix it. 

P.S. The light they fixed / replaced was very dim and after 1 day you can't even see the light is on unless you bend down to look at it and the message popped back up and says Run Light is out.

3291,3102,30-Jan-19,"Last week I went in for an oil change. Asked if they could look at my alignment again because the last time they did it, I drove off and it was doing the same thing and the manager confirmed that it was still pulling to the right. (After test driving it while I was in the car.) I got my oil changed and then they said I should schedule to come in for the alignment issue. So they said they needed about 2 hrs since I had a wrangler and only have to work on the front wheels. We chose Wednesday. (He said Monday’s are busy). This morning I got there thinking it would take 2 hours I brought my computer and started working. Minutes later I was told that they didn’t want me to have to wait around and since this issue is covered under warranty they would give me a rental. I wasn’t happy with the rental (because it wasn’t a wrangler instead it was a mini Cherokee). I was then insured it would be finished by 3pm.  At 2 pm I got a phone call saying it wouldn’t be ready today. I asked what was wrong? They said they are backed up. Mind you I drive around town as part of my work duties. So then they said we should know something tomorrow by 10am. So I had to go back there to get my children’s car seats out and garage opener. i spoke with the manager when I got there to express my dissapointment that my car was not completed today as I had been told it would. His response was unacceptable (to me). He explained that they get backed up and I shouldn’t tie them to a tight time frame and I should expect to have to wait 2 days because they have 180ish cars to servive. (Mind you they told me how long it would take: 1st 2 hours, then by the end of the day). He went on to say that he had put my car in front of 25 other cars as if he was doing me a favor. Then reminded me that it had been a while since I first had had the alignment looked at. (Again as if it was my fault and I had already explained to them personal/medical reasons why it had taken so long for me to return. Not acknowledging the fact that I was told after it was worked on the first time that something wasn’t done right. When I came in last week I wasn’t expecting anything free but was told they would make it right).  I then asked him how is that good customer service. Then he blamed others for telling me a time frame. Never once apologized and accepted responsibility. I asked if I could keep my place in line and when they were working on the car in front of mines if I could bring my car back within 15 mins of the call. He went around this question by saying something that could take 2 hours might take 4. He said one of his techs stays until 6pm and May be able to look at it tonight but work wouldn’t be don’t till tomorrow. I also asked what was the purpose of scheduling an appointment if they wouldn’t even look at my car that day. He then asked why didn’t I leave my car there last week. I explained that I wasn’t given that portion and it would be better to schedule. (He has no response for that) The whole time we had this conversation he seemed irritated by the fact that I was holding them accountable. I understand things happen and at least the service provider was nice, respectable and showed empathy and was trying to find solutions for me. (I also understand that he is limited in what he can do to help me). The manager on the other hand was cold and blamed others including myself. On another note if the warranty company is paying for the rental while my car is being repaired, I’m not so sure that they would be happy to know that they paid for a loaner car, and the first day 8:30-4:30 (Probably wasn’t looked at, at all) my car wasn’t even looked at. So now I wait until tomorrow at 9:30am for them to call me and tell me what the problem is with my car. (I was also told it should be finished by 10am tomorrow). I feel like I would have been better off staying there to wait, maybe they would have at least looked at it. ",1,67,0,0

I was working with Surya and we got financing all setup (I subsequently went with my credit union but not really the point of this review).  So they did not have it on the lot, the vehicle I wanted.  Surya said they could get it.  Well they located one really quickly but it was a demo with 2500 miles on it.  I said I didnt want a demo so we went to another truck.  Another truck came up and the dealer trade just couldnt be made but this was after Surya told me it was secured.   Then a 3rd vehicle came up.  The trade was done yet the day I was supposed to go in and sign it was told me to that this was a demo.  The salesperson took no blame for this is issue at all.  He said repeatedly it was not his fault and do not kill the messenger.  It was a comedy of errors of not setting expectations properly and not taking ownership for mistakes.

3295,3106,03-Jan-18,"Contacted several Jeep dealerships seeking a specific model of a Jeep renegade.  Was sent a email with a picture of the model I was looking for, so I called and set up an appointment.  Upon arriving I was not shown the Renegade that was shown in the email sent to me, but the sales person (Cary Murillo) listened to what I wanted and provided a similar model having the specifications I desired.  This is where things changed when it was learned that this was the Renegade I was interested in purchasing.   The process dragged out way too long taking almost 3 hours to purchase a Renegade for cash minus a trade in.  The trade in was a one owner vehicle with a clear title with no liens, had been excellently maintain by a dealership with all scheduled maintenance and was checked by that dealership just prior to this transaction.  The sales rep had to got to the manager to get the offer for the trade in and returned with a figure that was 1/3 of even a dealership trade in value.  When it was apparent that this figure was unacceptable and unrealistic to me, I was told that the manager ""didn't like the way the engine sounded""; but was also told the manager wasn't a mechanic.  The sales rep went back to the manager  and came back with an offer that was twice what was originally offered (this involved thousands of dollars).  It took less than 30 minutes to me to decide to buy the Renegade and most of the time spent waiting involved offers for the trade in.  If I had not already done my homework on the value of my trade in, I would have been out a lot of money to fatten the profit already being made upon me.  I have purchased many vehicles in my life and have faced this before as this is a well known ""car salesman"" tatic that people hate and fear.  Make extra money off the customer because they may not know what the trade-in value is and use some lame easy to back out of excuse for the first offer if the customer balks, and delay the whole process so the customer will get tired and agree to any offer just to get the whole process over with.  Good sales practice to increase profits, but has one bad side effect...You just showed the customer that you are trying to rip him off and makes the customer feel that he can't trust you to make a fair deal.  Makes the customer wonder what else in this deal are you pull and definitely brings out ""buyer beware"".  Definitely the trust is gone, and I didn't believe anything else said or excuses made to me after that.  The deal I finally agreed on still allowed the dealership to make a handsome profit on the trade-in as well as the sale, but it was what I expected. 
 I'm not against a dealership making a decent profit, but to try to rip the customer for more not only didn't get the more they wanted and lost the trust of the customer....doesn't sound like a good, long term business model to me.  Is it just in the sales department or does this tactic apply to their service department too by telling the customer he needs service that he really doesn't.  I won't find out as I will find another dealership for the service I need.  I will not purchased anything else from here and will tell all that I know to avoid this place that practices the old ""check with the manager game"".  I also hate the ""if you can't give us a 10 on reviews let us fix it"" game....you can't fix an attempt to rip the customer off.  Even if withdrawn, it still kills the trust.  I gave this review 2 stars not for the sales, but for large selection of vehicles in stock.   ",1,67,0,0

I pulled into their service floor and no one came outside after 10 minutes waiting in the service floor parking lot.   I decided to go inside to check in, all the technicians are sitting on chairs with a counter to separate them from the customers.  I told one tech, it was my first car service, and right away, I was ask with Who?  I told the technician who I was assigned to, and was redirected to that technician.   The technician I was redirected to, seems to be very frazzle with the workload he had over his counter on top of three more customers in from of me while the other technicians were joking and talking.   Why no one of his peers think of helping him, I don’t know.  But it was ver frustrating to be in there for 45 minutes before he can attend to me.  When he was able to talk with me, he informed me due to the problems my vehicle was experiencing that he was going to keep the vehicle for a day or two to find the cause, so I was giving a rental.  I thought that was a good compromise.   Anyway, my vehicle was dropped off on Monday morning, Tuesday not word on the status, Wednesday afternoon around 11 in the morning I decided to call asking for the status of my vehicle.   First time I phoned, The operator informed me, my technician was busy with another customer, and he would call me back.  15 minutes later, and he did.   He apologized for not able to take my call and gave me the status of my vehicle, told me that everyone went to lunch and I couldn’t get my vehicle yet, but that he would call me around 2:30 in the afternoon to let me know if I could.   Never happened.  So, by 4:00 in the afternoon, I decided to be more proactive and call.   Again, he was busy, and he will call me back.  15 minutes later, he was apologizing for not able to answering the phone and calling me back to let me know if I could pick up my car.   At this point he informed me I could.  I was excited but disappointed with the level of inefficiency within the company.  These are some of my personal suggestions to make that place on running much better.  Firstly, When you pulled in to the station for a service, some technician should be redirecting to you where you need to go or checking you in the spot with an iPad.  Using technology is beneficial on this circumstance.  If that is not possible a sign with instructions on the check in process.  

Secondly, technicians should be able to help anyone that come by the office if there are free. 

Thirdly, have a computer system where anyone can give you a level explanation on the status of your car, it would help the technicians improve overall experience with the customers on site without interruptions.   

There is more ideas I have but for the purpose of this review.  I think I am giving my most honest answer of my experience.  ",1,68,1,0

3343,3157,18-Feb-18,"Absolutely the worst experience I have ever encountered at any dealership.  This is my 4th and last Dodge.  The service department could care less about its customers.  The lackadaisical attitudes, the 'we are doing you a favor by even acknowledging you presence’ is just appalling.  This started from the time I called them with the snobby attitude on the phone, to the minute I walked into the service department and everyone was either ‘busy’ or just staring at their computer monitors.  I have a huge right up going into detail, but it is too large to post here.  To think that they are the ‘best’ inside of 1604 of the Dodge dealerships is just amazing.  Can’t imagine what the others are like.  Thank God I purchased a extended warranty and was able to take it to Alamo Toyota where they performed the repair of a oil sending unit replacement for free, and even offered me a loaner vehicle.  Ancira, you want to learn how to treat your customers?  Hire Ronnie at Alamo Toyota and give him a raise to boot.   I can sum it up with this:  ‘Your keys are at the cashiers booth’.  That’s it.

3344,3158,20-Jul-17,"In summary: Worst car buying experience we've ever had. I've never worked so hard to give someone my money. Do not shop here. Tell your friends not to shop here. Spend your money elsewhere and safe yourself a lot of misery. 

In detail: This was a good experience until we committed to purchasing a vehicle and signing our names on paper. At that point, we were handed off from one person to another (working with a total of 5 different people!), with poor communication between the employees and multiple mistakes made. There was no disclosure of the total price, financing options, or APR until we explicitly asked for it and, even then they were not forthcoming with the information. Additionally, our initial APR offer from them was over 5% until we informed them that we would be financing through another company. At that point their APR offer quickly dropped to less than 3%. We stuck with our other financing options. 

By TX law, the dealership has to register the vehicle for you. We wanted to register the vehicle in our home state and transfer my old plates, as we're only in TX temporarily. We were told that we couldn't do that. A quick call to our home state DMV confirmed that, yes, actually we could and suddenly the problem was solved. The dealership also held onto the registration paper work for 3 WEEKS after everything was official, further delaying the registration process. They had initially told us the paper work would be mailed off the same week we received the vehicle. This is unacceptable. When I called to check the status of the registration, Michelle, the Title Clerk,  rudely interrogated me as to why we chose to register our vehicle in a state other than TX (she did not approve of our decision).... obviously mailing a stack of 10 papers instead of 5 is too much of a hassle, even for someone who has just spent over $40,000 with your company. This is an example of pathetic laziness and extremely poor customer service. 

We have continuously had to call and go back to the dealership to follow up on paperwork (I went back 3 times after we signed everything) and they always come up with an excuse as to why the job isn't finished yet. What it comes down to in the end is they only want your money and are not concerned with maintaining appropriate business integrity, honest disclosure with their customers, or good customer service relationships. I would give them 0/5 stars if I could. ",1,68,0,0

First call to us, the service person was ready to get our info and said that he was gonna get the service done on that same day until we said our vehicle had extended warranty... well, it went downhill from there! the first thing the service guy had the guts to tell us was ""are you trying to trying to get a new engine out of this?!"" Let me tell you this, we purchase extended warranty for a reason, and I'm paying you to tell me what's wrong with my vehicle and yes, if the issue will lead to us getting a new engine so be it!

3368,3189,24-Feb-17,"This review is not about the folks in the service department - my experience, when I am actually able to get an appointment, is that they are good people and strive to provide decent service. Nor is this a review of their ""Express Lane"" service for oil changes and such - that seems to be working. Rather, I'm writing about service needs for other than ""Express Lane"" items. Note, if you don't have specifics for them for what you need looked at or serviced - you will likely end up frustrated. They simply don't have time to a provide a more consultative experience. But lately, the real problem has been in actually getting ahold of anyone to schedule a  service appointment. I left several messages for a callback to schedule my last appointment. All calls ALWAYS rolled to voicemail. Over a period of two weeks, and after several messages, I never got a call back so finally I drive down to the dealership to make an appointment in person! That seems to be the only way to get an appointment now - and they seem to be scheduling at minimum two weeks out or more now. They are clearly overwhelmed - and it's disappointing that this issue has been neglected and left to get worse and worse. At present,  I again need to take my vehicle in for a non ""Express Lane"" issue. I've given up leaving voicemails - no callback yet again. And I don't have time, nor desire, to drive down and schedule in person. I’m taking my business elsewhere. Further, I won’t be purchasing vehicles from Covert going forward. The fact that the continuing and worsening service issues I've referenced are clearly not being addressed is a glaring a red flag.

3389,3211,29-Mar-18,"I have a 2013 Chevrolet Suburban that has a second water leak on a body seam leaking into the passengers floorboard. To back up a little bit this car replaced a 2010 Tahoe that had a roof that was leaking and they were going to have to replace the roof on the car. So we got the suburban thinking that the Tahoe was just a lemon and this one would be better. Well back to the leaking car. I took the car to the dealership and was told that it was probably leaking around the windshield that had been replaced. So I made an appointment with the body shop and they tested the windshield and found no leaks. A couple of weeks later I am back at the dealership and was told that it was going to cost around $300.00 to diagnose the problem. I was called later and told it was a body seam leaking and that it was not covered. I asked if I could come take pictures ( they would not let me take pictures of the first leak ). I asked if I could come take pictures and I was told that they hadn't taken the car apart yet but when they did I could take pictures. When I got there to take pictures I was told it was leaking behind a blob of caulking that GM smears on the seams. I made the comment that any normal person could see that if the blob of caulking would have been smeared in the area of the leak it would not have leaked. I asked them how they would repair the leak and the answer was to put some more caulking in the area behind the original blob of caulking. So in other words where the other caulking should have been. Their answer was always the same, I don't know.  I have a case on this problem with GM and the service department  will not mention to them that if the caulking would have smeared in the area that was leaking  it may have never leaked. All they would mention to them was the car had been in an accident in which the body shop told me there was no damage in that area.  They also told GM that it may have been cause by the way I drive, weather conditions, or the flexing of the vehicle that cracks the body sealant causing it to separate  ( I did not see any cracks or separation ). I went back to the dealership and told them I needed documentation as to what caused it to leak and also that something stating that the door gasket and wires running along the threshold of the door had been under water because of the water leak and I was told I had all of the documentation on my invoice I was going to get. All it said was where body seam was leaking  and that it was fixed.  I was told that the corporate person was just giving me the run around.

3416,3238,14-Feb-19,"Bought a used car from Huffines Kia in Oct ‘17 with around 75,000 miles on it, added the “platinum plus” warranty for powertrain coverage until 100,000 miles. In and out no problems, the buying experience was actually a pleasure compared to any other vehicle we have purchased, as a matter of fact we highly recommended Huffines since that day and never planned to go anywhere else for another car purchase.   As for this car, regular maintenance was done and the car had been running fine since purchased, last check and oil change was only 4 weeks earlier. Wife was driving home Friday and car just loses all power and dies on highway and will not start up regardless of what we try. Checked oil since service was recently done and found oil still looks “clean” and within spec. We get car towed to Huffines KIA and wait all day Monday for any news as to what the issue is, finally around 5 we find out the engine has seized, they cannot provide a reason as to why this happened. We go through the process of verifying we had the extended warranty but only until 100k miles and we are a little over 103k so repairs would not be covered. Price quoted for a new engine is $30,000 or a used engine for $9,000, an engine found online is ~$1,600, these prices don’t even include labor which is another ~$1,500. The car in good running condition is only worth $3100-$4200 according to KBB so we obviously are not going to spend more than the car is worth in repairs. Our info is passed to the sales team and we are told to provide service records and the service consultant will “go to bat” for us with KIA to see if they will cover any of the repair. We don’t hold on to receipts very long so we provided what we could find/get which wasn’t much, and as expected KIA said they would not help, I suspect this would be the case either way as service is where the vast majority of their money is made. We have a 2008 Ford that has never had any issue until 2 days earlier when the transmission gave out at ~150k miles, so I guess we aren’t doing too bad when it comes to vehicle maintenance.

After our info was passed to the sales team, we scheduled a time to come in and discuss trade/purchase of a vehicle. During this discussion of the situation, our credit and available down payment, we were basically told that we should not have bought the first used vehicle to begin with (even though we bought it from Huffines), the sales person also found out we had another working car (how do you think we got there in the first place) and we were then treated as if we didn’t need to replace the car with the seized engine. The sales person also became very uninterested in selling a used car and only seemed to want to sell us a new one. We are upside down on a car that will not be repaired so we cannot roll it into a new purchase and therefore only have 2 options, eat the repair (not going to happen) or try and get approval for another vehicle when we already have 3 financed, one of which is the seized engine, so that is not likely to happen either. So since KIA won’t stand behind their product at all past 100k miles, and Huffines didn’t want anything to do with it, I suppose we are stuck with a very expensive paper weight… Needless to say Huffines and especially KIA are no longer recommended by us or anyone we know.

STRIKE 1. Made appointment to see two cars (2016 Genesis) - Got there and was told they were not in inventory and they didn't know that until I was waiting to see the cars.  
-Was told another one just came in (matching my criteria) - was at Plano Huffines and could be brought up (was not in inventory yet and had not been made ready)  no problem.  
Liked the car and bought it on Saturday (6-8-19).  I bought a protection package for interior and exterior, extended service warranty and window tinting (which was given for no cost (thank you) .  Car would be ready Thursday (time to fix minor body damage and cracked windshield, put tint on windows and apply the interior and exterior protection products)
-Picked the car up Thursday and drove home- pretty excited...these are nice cars and this had all the bells and whistles and looked sharp

STRIKE 2. Noticed the driver seat was dirty (seats are almost white) - I saw the smudges and dirtiness (not bad, but noticeable)  when I first looked at the car, but thought it odd that this wasn't cleaned up when they readied the car and applied the protection package.
I then looked under the hood (should have done this prior to buying...stupid me) - the engine compartment was VERY dirty with leaves, dust and debris .  Took pictures (which I wish I could include here) and sent to the sales person (Jerry Blow) .  Told me in email ""The engine compartments are not detailed due to the risk of water damage to components""
I then told him about the dirty seat - he then said the ""Smart Shield"" was not applied and I should bring it back at my convenience.  Glad I asked.....This package is a bit pricey for what it is.  How was this overlooked?????

STRIKE 3 - THIS IS A BIG ONE-  I bought this car at a Hyundai dealership specifically to get a Certified Pre Owned (CPO) vehicle .  I was given a brochure telling me how great the CPO program was with nearly 173 inspection points.   
Because of the dustiness / dirtiness of the engine compartment something really stuck out.  Did they even check the air filter????  This filter is a pain to inspect- there is a bar across it that had to be removed ( bolts on either end) and there was no sign in the dust that it had been touched, let alone inspected.  Surely this is on the CPO checklist
I looked into the CPO process further and discovered that before the car can be CPO approved, there is a comprehensive checklist that must be completed and signed by 4 authorized people- technician who did the checks, the service manager, the CPO program manager and finally the customer.   THIS WAS NOT DONE and, until I dug into it, I did not know this was a key document in the sales process!!!!!!!!!  
                                        How did it get CPO certified and sold without this being done

- I brought the car back for the Smart Shield application and a complete CPO inspection - they had the car for a couple of days and provided a NC loan vehicle.  Got the car back and signed the CPO document (Service Manager was very attentive and professional - (Tony Saif) 

STRIKE 4 - It's been 6 weeks since I bought the car.  Thought it was odd that I had not gotten my plates / registration.  
Called yesterday (7-17-19) to get status update.  Oh! the car should have been inspected when it up there last time- I could bring back there or go somewhere locally and they would reimburse me the cost of the inspection.  
NO PAPERWORK WAS SUBMITTED because of this - no call, email or text telling me they dropped the ball again.  What the heck......

I was actually pretty mad and was going to contact Mr. Huffines to let him know the bevy of problems and mistakes at this dealership, but my wife advised me to 1st call the sales manager to see if he was aware of the problems, etc associated with this sale.  Called and (as he would not be in till the afternoon), requested he (Ben Hagan) call me back.  NO CALL BACK.  Did he get the message ???- super nice guy , but .........

So those are the reasons for this poor review.  Would you buy a vehicle with this kind of service, response and attention to detail????   I know there are better places to go (the car is really nice) ",1,72,0,0

449,3257,07-May-18,"I leased a Kia Sorento April 12th and traded in a vehicle.  My family and I have purchased three cars from Jerry Blow and would highly recommend him as he teaches and helps with the decision making process.  
However the financing team is less than stellar. The new automated desktop which prompts for signatures was used to complete the financing paperwork.  I made the first month's payment and told I should receive a refund for my April 15th payment on the trade in.  Well several days later I was called for additional signatures so I made the 65 mile drive each way to sign more paperwork.  
Last week on May 2, I called the previous lender to follow up on my refund.  Almost 3 weeks later, the payoff had not been received from Huffines. I called and was told that the payoff would not be transmitted because there was MORE paperwork that needed signing.  Had I not called I wonder how long it would have taken for this to be addressed.
My next call was to Randy Knight the financing manager and left a voice mail.  Did I get a return phone call? NO!!! So last Saturday I drive another 65 miles each way to sign additional paperwork.  I spoke with the sales director Benjamin Bazi who assured me that he would get with Mr. Knight to effect resolution and call me today.  Did I receive a phone call today? NOPE The best he could offer me for my time and inconvenience was a third of a tank of gas.  
Now I may have confused myself with the customer but a part of tank of gas is no longer going to cut it.  I am now behind on a payment on a car I no longer own and have no idea when the previous lender is going to receive payment.  I need to hear from someone with the ability to answer these questions, make me whole and provide adequate consideration for my trouble.  Wonder when and who that'll be.....",1,72,0,0
3432,3258,29-Jul-17,"I had a big problem with Huffines Hyundai Dealership in McKinney, TX. After buying my new 2017 Hyundai Accent at another dealer, I went to the Hyundai dealership at McKinney on 06/28/2017 for procuring a spare tire kit (Part number 1R40-AC900) as Hyundai does not provide one. The dealer charged me a total of $319.31 ($272.00 for the kit and tire, $20.00 for mounting the tire to the rim and $22.81 Tax). I was told that I would have to pay a charge of $20.00 for the mounting the tire to the rim of the spare kit. The purchase of the spare tire kit should include the mounting of the tire. Last year, I purchased a spare tire kit (invoice number 51189 dated 06/23/2016) at Fenton Hyundai at Mesquite, TX for my new 2016 Hyundai that I had purchased at another dealer . At that time the Fenton Hyundai charged me a total of $270.63 ($250.00 for the tire kit including tire and tax of $20.63). There was no charge for mounting of the tire on the rim. I still have the bill for that purchase. You will observe how much more that the dealer at McKinney charged me as compared the dealer at Mesquite. 
Even after paying $20 for mounting the tire, the service personnel would not balance the tire and put tire kit into the trunk of the car. ",1,72,0,0
3433,3259,06-May-17,I had purchased a 2014 Cadenza from Tony mcloud. It was late in the evening. Was not able to see the Hail Damage on the car. Our insurance company came out to look at the car as we added the car The day before. They advised us that the car had pre existing hail damage and if it hailed the insurance will only cover 70% of the damages. The next day took the car back and showed it to manager Kevin and was told to go ahead and make appointment with Tony to bring the car in so they will take care of it. Absolutely no problem . Tony didn't give me an appointment until Monday and that Sunday it hailed really bad in McKinney and the car was damaged a lot so insurance only gave us 70% of the claim.  Called Tony mcloud and he advised he will speak to Kevin and get back to me. So he called and left a voicemail stating no problem we will take care of it just bring us what the insurance paid and they will take care of the rest. Asked me to bring the car there drop it off along with the cash.  I dropped the car off along with cash. Hour later Kevin called and stated before you go get the rental to stop by so I did. When I got there he said his paintless guys can repair the car but it will not be very good job. So the car really needed to go to the body shop to get it done right. And he will talk to his body shop and take care of it. It's been over a month and I haven't heard anything back. I will get the car fixed and pay out of my pocket over $1500.  Which I shouldn't have to as Tony left a voicemail stating they will take care of it. But never did I am leaving this review because my experience stated with them really great but there words absolutely meant nothing. I still have that voicemail saved.  So my advice to everyone wanting to do business with these guys is do not buy a car from them in the dark. And if you do inspect it very well before you sign papers. Because as I came to find out there words are meaningless.   Take your money elsewhere and give it to a reputable dealer who will do what they said they would. ,1,72,0,0
3449,3280,03-Sep-19,"I purchased my VW Passat in April. I previously posted because there were issues with the tires, oil, mildewed filters in the car, etc. Then two months later, after taking the car in several times, found out there were major issues with the engine that was being caused by the oil problem when I purchased the car... no problem right... I bought the warranty! Well my car sat at Patterson VW in Tyler for almost a month, Brinson provided a loaner car. Patterson jumped through every hoop asked by the Ford ESP warranty. Yet they still wouldn't pay for the engine to be replaced. One day alone, I made 12 calls to Brinson... and never received a call back. I have called so many times that they know me when I call. I was told they needed to pick up their loaner car... cool... what am I supposed to drive while the warranty is still being process supposedly, ""that is not our concern, nor problem, but you can rent a car at your own expense"". Why should I be renting a car when I just purchased a car. I got fed up and took the car back to trade it, which I felt was my only option... they wouldn't trade the car back and then Cheryl wouldn't even tell me how much the car was worth... I went to Brinson in Corsicana and had the car valued and 4 months later, there's a $4K difference in what they sold it to me for. I think I have been patient dealing with this for 4 months. Having the car towed here and there, sitting at the shop, VW firmly stating the engine, turbo, and exhaust need to be replaced, and Brinson doing exactly NOTHING about it... so it's time to take this to the next level, and not because I may win or lose, but because it is the principle of the matter... stand by what you sell or at least attempt to make it right!",1,73,0,0

3452,3284,22-Apr-18,"I would give them 0 stars - I should have done this months ago but I got busy and am just now getting to it.  As I go to file a complaint about Brinson Ford - Athens, I see that their ratings are already pitiful.  Now it makes sense, they just don't care.  My complaint is that they are very unethical and be sure to check your mileage of your new & old car before signing off on it.  I don't see where they did anything illegal (or at least can't prove it because I was not there at the time of purchase).  My 80 year old grandma with the help of a daughter purchased a used car from them in May.  Several people pointed out that the car had a damaged frame (as if it had been wrecked and repaired).  The dashboard lights would randomly come on, low tires/gas cap open/engine warning light/inaccurate cruise control setting. After repeated visits to Brinson Ford, the only suggestions the service department gave here was to trade it in for a price much lower than her purchase price.  (Shortly after she purchased it, she went into the hospital for two weeks and then couldn't drive for another two weeks.)  She went back 6/10, alone.  She was talked into trading the used car that she owned less than two months for a new car.  The paperwork says she drove over 600 miles in that short time.  There is no way she even went 200 miles.  She went in to speak with her salesman, Scot, and he convinced her that the Focus was not enough for her, she needed a Fusion.  The owners manual was not in the car and after repeated requests, she said Jarvis Coper was very helpful and got that together with her plates and spare key.  I went over all of the paperwork and went in to talk to the finance manager.  The sale was done, we were not asking to give the car back and get our money.  I wanted to know their side of the story before I posted her side on the internet.  I asked if they told her how much she would be losing if she traded it in.  Mike or Mark (whoever the finance guy is) said that they go over the numbers in detail.  A typical ""little old lady"" isn't going to understand your ""details"" but she would understand if you said ""you are about to lose $8000"".   These guys lack then ability to put themselves in the place of anyone else.  All they are seeing is $$$$.  My question was ""how would you feel if your mother/grandmother/wife/sister/daughter felt like someone took advantage of them all because they didn't want to 'bother' you?""  The guy was either flustered or didn't understand the policies that he is selling.  He wanted to argue about her needing GAP insurance.  I read the contract, we can call and cancel so that does not concern him.  I had to correct him on how GAP insurance works.  Hopefully he knows and was just caught off guard.  As for the extended warranty, I wanted a refund for that.  He did show me where they pro-rated it and applied it to her down payment on the new car, which is fair but was very rude and hostile about the entire situation.  He then continued to argue the extended warranty sale on the new car and refused to refund that.  He said it was not possible for the way they created the loan.  When you choose 0% interest, you are losing out on other rebates.  The dealers will push it but it is not always worth it.  That was the case here.  She bought a brand new car, got a $1500 rebate... so paid 1500 less than sticker price.  When it comes down to it, they made a lot of money off this little old lady.  Talking to him was like talking to a programmed minion, almost like he was reading a phrase it out of a book, repeating it over and over.  He doesn't know anything but what he was told.",1,73,0,0
3453,3285,05-Dec-17,Bought a Ford Explorer and Ford F150 and havent had either of them more than a year. The Ford Explorer we are just getting out of the shop for exhaust fumes. Also has a bad noise coming from the dash in which I was told they could not fix because thats under the 12 month 12000 mile warranty. Explore just went over 12000 mile warranty. They said 36000 bumper to bumper warranty doesnt cover that. We tried getting the car in months ago before 12000 miles and they kept saying not to bring it in until it makes the noise. The noise would come and go so they said dont bring. Now they say they cant fix it. The Ford F150 is going in to shop tomorrow for safety recall and when starting a huge cloud of white smoke pours out of the tailpipe which is very embarrassing to drive.

3470,3302,02-Jun-20,"Date line 5/22/2020 I called about a 2016 CPO Ford Escape that Grapevine Ford had advertised. Was contacted immediately and they went through their spill about how if I would fill out a credit app they would come of the price $500 even though I had told them is was a cash deal. Was told they are not a front of house dealership and did not do cash discounts. Now I was quoted $18,800+- for the car they had advertised for $16500.  I asked for an explanation and the oh so smart salesman said it included some anti theft gimmick that was $500 plus and an extra key that was $500 plus because there was only one with the car, also ttl for Oklahoma that he said was required by them to include at 4 1/2 %, which I knew was a lie. There was still $700 dollars difference in their so called out the door price, come to find out he had also tried to include dealer finance fees or some other nonsense. Finally he says $16,183.33 which I agreed to and made sure it would include a 2nd key which magically appeared while on the phone. He said ""i have it right here in my hand."" So, reluctantly, I agree to drive down the next morning and meet at 9 am and if everything checks out would make the deal. I should have known better! Get there and drive the car which was advertised as having lane assist and the brake assist and back up alarms all features that I wanted for my daughter. Thought it was me and that I had not activated features so, when I returned to dealer and asked how to activate. He gets in and fumbles around not saying anything except let me printout the window sticker and he took off to his office, brought it back and started off on how rare this gem of a car was to have traction control?!? I asked again about the 
lane assist and other safety features. He says oh, this car does not have those features, they are only available on 2020 models! I said your internet ad states that it does, so he tells me, ""Well I dont write those ads."" 
Then totally exasperated I walk out as he is saying ""We have 2020's."" Wow, what a piece of work, I am stunned that dealerships like this exist and this was my first and last experience with Grapevine Ford. I have always bought from Huffines in Corinth Classic in Sherman and always treated with respect and make transparent deals. Oh, and he also said they have the lowest priced dealer ad ons in the metroplex, bragging rights??? Part of the double talk I have  left out for times sake that were just as bogus as the rest. Anyway, buyer beware as they always say! Not going to mention the assistant sales managers name, but you know who you are, I was not your sucker customer of the day.  Buyer's please know what you are getting into on these deals, always ask for a full disclosure of fees and there close to 100% profit add ons are a hoax.
 The absolute worst part of this is they have these huge floor displays of the 10 rules of ethics, yeah right! By the way, those $500 keys are usually around $200 retail at honest dealerships and can be had all day online for $100.

3473,3305,14-Dec-19,"Short version...I went in to make a deal on a 2019 Hyundai Santa Fe but could not come to an agreement with Garry, mainly because of the $500 Kahu tracking device they supposedly already put on the car (even though they just received the car and it hadn't even been detailed or service) and could not remove. He said it adds value to the car and insurance companies will give discounts for having it. Well I asked my insurance broker and he said most insurance companies do NOT give a discount. My daughter does not need to spend $500 for something that is worthless to her but apparently Grapevine Ford forces on you, period. After spending an hour there Garry said he could come off the price of the car $500 and reduce the cost of the Kahu theft recovery system to $251 and then told me that he couldn't take my deposit money to hold the car anyway, until my daughter got in town. I told them in the beginning that this I was helping my daughter find a car and she wouldn't be in town for another week. Why did he waste an hour of my life if he already knew this! Then a couple of days later Dustin calls me (the original sales manager who wasn't working when I went back the second day to put money down) and asked what he could do to earn my business. I told him all I was asking was to come down $500 (off a $27,500 car by the way) and remove the $500 Kahu system. He told me he would see what he could do and call me back. Well it's been 4 days and he never called back. My daughter will be in town tomorrow to purchase her ""new"" car so we're headed to Austin to purchase basically the same car with a few thousand more miles for $1,300 less.

There is so much to cover and I'm not in the habit of leaving negative feedback, even when mediocre service is tendered.  However in this instance I think that for the sake of future buyers at your dealership I should say something. 

My experience in a nut shell. 
     Pros:  * Brian Rojas was attentive, personable and helpful as my salesperson.
               * The vehicle was in the condition it was advertised as being, and was delivered clean and full of fuel. 

      Cons:
                 * I made it implicitly clear with my salesperson and the sales manager, that I had guaranteed financing with my bank and that this would be treated as a cash deal.  They said they needed my credit information to run a quick check to ensure my information was valid.   I said to the salesperson ""You are not running my credit for financing, correct? He said yes, for sure.""   The new car sales manager Blane Castorena came to talk to me and asked if he could beat the deal my credit union gave me could they try to run my credit for a try.   I said, thank you but no, I did not want my credit pulled again and that I was comfortable staying with my bank.   When I went into financing and signed the documents, I asked for the sales document to give to my credit union, and the finance manager said oh, Blane Castorena told me that if I could beat you rate that you would finance, even though the salesperson disagreed and said that was not the case.  So long story short I went ahead and financed with their bank even though it completely irked me to do so. 
                  * Given the financing fiasco enumerated above, I tried to get insurance on my new car, but none of my finance paperwork shows a lean holder and the agreement to furnish insurance has the loss holder as none.  Had to call my poor sales guy back to chase down the information. 
                  * The car wasn't inspected and I need to go back to the dealership to complete.   

After all of this the finance manager felt really bad and gave me two free oil changes, I was okay and left mostly satisfied, given the not so pleasant experience mentioned above.  So much so that I was talking with a family friend, showing her the car and telling her the deal I got.   She wanted the same deal so I called my sales person back and asked if he could make that happen.  He said he could and we set up an appointment on Monday 11/25. 

I go with my friend to the dealership, and my salesperson said he had a doctors appointment and so he handed us off to another sales person.  Although this was okay, it was not ideal.   The new salesperson was great and we made it work.   I trying to work the same deal, all over again, because of the salesperson change.  All I wanted was the internet advertised price and the two discounts that she qualified for.   They came out with a different price and as you can imagine had questions, the salesperson didn't feel completely comfortable answering all of them, so he went and asked Blane Castorena to come out and explain, yes the same Blane Castorena that outright lied to the finance manager on my deal.   I put that aside and asked him for explanation of each of the numbers, which is within my rights.    He then turned to me and asked are you buying this?   I said no, that my friend was, but that she appointed me as her agent.  He then turned from me to her and said, I'm only going to deal with her because she is the one buying.   So he turned to her started grilling her, and she was panicking, I told him to talk with me and she told him the same.  He then became extremely rude, though back the chair and walked away, I said really?  You're going to treat a customer this way, you're not following your dealerships service credo, will I just need to talk to your manager.   He said ohh I'm so scared, and then when in his glass frame office and when in cover he called me an xxxxxxx!!!

At this point I was furious, I asked my salesmen for Blane's manger and he just grabbed another dude standing in the office, I'm pretty sure it was not the Blane's superior.  The tried to smooth it over, but my friend decided that she did not want to give them her business so we left.   

I'm within my 3-day purchase window and I'm seriously considering taking the car I bought back.  I bought the vehicle for my daughter and already presented it to her, that is the only reason I haven't taken it back, in fear of breaking her heart. 

I'm so very disappointed and when the dealership assessment comes back from Ford, this comment will go in it.   For the sake of future customer's I hope that something comes of this so that Blane Castorena becomes afraid to treat customers like he treated me. ",1,74,0,1

When I get there Bridget, who was the person I was supposed to see, said that I never scheduled an appointment. When I showed her my conformation see looked it up, then she found me. Then she says that they are behind by 4 days so I will have to leave my car there for 4 days before they even look at it. So I asked Bridget if there was a loner that I could get because I need a car to get to work. She tells me loners are cars that we give to you and you have to bring it back in the same condition that I got it in. I was like that's so rude she was acting like I would not be responsible with a loner, first of all I'm a valet, so I know how to handle others cars with care, and second, I've had a loner before. After all that she says without checking her computer or anything that she doesn't have a loner till next week and set me an appointment for then. I left there so angry, she just waisted my time and I left there with just another appointment. So I called McDavid Lincoln in plano and they gave me an appointment on the same day and when I got there, Ed who is a service associate over there was way nicer than the people at Grapevine, not only did they look at the car the same day, within 2 hours Ed ordered the part and I was on my way home.

I explained that I did not need to sign to get my car and took the key fob and proceeded to my car.  Some knucklehead sales rep informed that he was filming me.  Nice move!  This is just one of over a dozen terrible experiences I have had with service at Grapevine Ford Lincoln.  Don't have the space to write about the time that service department failed to properly replace the fuel filter on my F250, initially refused to replace a screen on my MKZ, and the list goes on...  Do business with these folks at your own peril.  If you're unhappy you can't say I didn't tell you.",1,74,1,0
3478,3311,15-Sep-19,"I drove from Lubbock Texas to Grapevine to visit my daughter. When I hit Roanoke, my steering wheel was vibrating and it was happening when stopped and when in parked and idling. Rather than risk it, I made the MISTAKE of going to Grapevine Ford. Rather than address the issue, they decided to hand me a $4300 list of recommended service items. Upon returning to Lubbock (mind you I was worried during the whole 4 1/2 drive), I immediately got brakes and rotors changed. I was told my pads were good for another 30000 miles and I also said that Grapevine Ford said my shocks/struts were leaking. I was told that is a TYPICAL ploy to make a quick $1000! 

Oh and the day I go to pick up the car, Eddie handed me my paperwork and keys. No one offered to get my car!!! The courtesy car wash could have been better done by a bunch of monkeys!

I’ve read enough reviews to know it’s not worth contacting the dealership management as service manager is insulting and belittling.

3479,3312,11-Sep-19,"Over a month ago I went into Grapevine Ford after they agreed to purchase my 2011 Ford Explorer for $7000.  I am currently living and working in China, so I asked if it would be possible to do the sale.  I was told by Gus, the manager over purchasing, that it would be possible.  He had me sign some papers, and said that as soon as the title arrived he would send me a check for the amount agreed upon.  Following that, I went to the airport.  A couple weeks after this I learned from the people sending the title that it had been received at Grapevine Ford a week prior.  At this point I called Gus and was told he would be sending me the check via FedEx, and would give me a tracking number.  Several days passed and I had not heard from him.  I contacted him again, and was told that FedEx would not deliver a check.  He told me he would have the comptroller wire the money, so I provided him very sensitive bank information.  Again several days passed with no word, so I contacted Gus.  He told me he had given the comptroller the information and that he believed they had sent it.  Several days later there was nothing sent to the bank, so I contacted Jennifer James, the comptroller directly.  I was only able to reach her voicemail, and after several attempts decided this was a dead end.  I finally reached Gus again, and was told that they were unable to wire the money.  He told me they had sent the check via USPS, but he does not have the tracking number.  He told me he would get the tracking number and send it to me today.  This has not happened, and I am now filing this, believing that I have had my car basically stolen and sold by this dealership.  ",1,74,0,0

I’ve purchased three Toyota’s in 18 years and have put over 400K miles on them. I decided to purchase a NEW truck for the first time ever. I settled on the nearly 80K Ford Raptor as a 40th present to myself. At 6000 miles I started having oil pressure issues and transmission issues. The dealer I purchased it from said I should bring it in. I did that at 8,000 miles. I brought it in and must say that Grapevine Ford must be the worst service organization. The service group was lightly staffed on that day and had to search for someone to give my truck to.  The two service managers were not around, but I grabbed their cards. I left messages with both of them. One never called me back and the other’s VM says it’s broken so I need to text him, which I did. While I was waiting around I asked for some water and was told “there is a water fountain inside.” No attempts to say “let me go get that or offer a bottle water.” No attempts to go the extra mile when I clearly have major issues. The manager and I spoke on Monday and when I asked him about a loaner his response was “Did you buy that with the warranty?” Wow! Didn’t realize I needed to do that as I never bought a new car and quite frankly never had an issue with one of the Toyota’s in all those years. I would expect that you spend $80K on a car that would be the least they would do when it’s determined I have  head gaskets and transmission issues four months after purchase. I Ubered for a week and had great customer service. Upon picking it up on Friday I got in to find they had driven it for about 40 miles based on the paperwork. Did they fill it up with gas after making the repairs? Nope. Did they even wash it with all the dirt from having service guys all over it. No again. I asked about it and the response was astounding. “If you were my customer I would have made sure it was washed.” Really? So, the 80K I spent at Ford doesn’t constitute me as your customer.

I took this exact list (who knows if I even needed all 9 items) to a highly rated auto service nearby.  These 9 items totaled $750 there.

I told him I had to be back in a couple of weeks and we could discuss it then, but he continued to push and refused to accept my answer. He told me my oil change was free because I had paid for the MPP Care Coverage (which I still have the paperwork for), then turned around and charged me $38 for it. I was also charged $24.50 for ""customer pay environmental disposal fees for repair order,"" when I did not have any repairs done, and had already been charged separately for the tire disposal. They also did not document the required ""DOT number"" on all four of my tires for the extra protection I had purchased, despite charging me for it on the previous page. I was barely even given enough time to see where I needed to sign before they were rudely rushing me out the door.

We have owned 4 Ford Expeditions and like Ford.  We purchased our last Ford from Grapevine Ford and thus continued going to them for our service.

We brought the supposed problem to be evaluated at another Ford dealership and we were told the problem didn't exist. After alot of time and energy Grapevine Ford admitted their wrong and made it right, but I put a high emphasis on alot of work to make them accept responsibility of wrong doing (down right unethical in my opinion).

Recently our son brought his car in for an oil change and he was told by the advisor that is tie end rods were in critical need of repair and recommended he fix them right then. My husband was called and he determined he needed to get another opinion.  Two mechanics looked at the vehicle and determined that there was no problem with tie end rods. We met with the tech, advisor and supervisor to have the vehicle put up on rack and the tech put his hands on tires and said see they are bad. We asked him to do it at the brand new car next to his car which was also up on rack and it looked exactly the same.  They had every opportunity to back step and admit it was a incorrect call and didn't  We went and talked to the person that was involved in my expedition and he said let me look at and I said the car is gone but we will have one more mechanic look at it and then call him  Another mechanic looked at it and said the tie end rods are tight and fine and wouldnt recommend anything be done because nothing needed to be done.

When I called again to ask why I hadn't been called back I was told that the car had been sold to someone else so they didn't call me. It seemed like they were stalling until they could sell the car to someone else for their asking price.  Then they wanted me to come back to look at other vehicles.  I reluctantly told them I would the next day.  In the meantime I got online and found what I wanted at another dealership. I went there the next morning and did a test drive. They were willing to make the deal I wanted if I would purchase the car before I left. I left there as the owner of the new car that I wanted.

We negotiated a good price on a truck and agreed to buy the vehicle and after all paperwork done and downpayment given (with trade-in), they refused to give the truck to us. I think it was because they either sold it ""again"" to someone else or we did not buy any additional services like insurance from them. 

They played games and told us to come back the next day to pick up the truck. We go at 11am time which was given and it was in ""detail"" so we waited and one guy came and said there was confusion so to come later in the afternoon at 1pm and the truck will be out of detail and ready for pickup. We go at 3 pm and still the truck is not ready and they claim it is going to go in detail. So obvious reaction is frustration. A manager called us in and yelled at us in her office and said to get out of dealership and they won't give us the truck. We called the cops however it is a civil case. 

We hired an attorney to enforce the agreement both parties already signed however they cancelled our loan without our permission and said the contract was null and void. Also, the arbitration clause in the agreement ceases your right to sue them for this cheating and scam. 

After this incident, we just went and bought a truck at the 5 star ford in north Richland hills and they have excellent service and no arbitration clause when you buy a vehicle.

I was expecting the 172-point inspection to give me assurance of a reliabile, mostly damage free, vehicle with low mileage. Not at all what I received. Every negative issue with vehicle was the ""previous owner's fault or doing"", as stated by management. After certifying a vehicle by, and for, Ford, I am concerned by the issues that would not have passed even my inspection, that passed and qualified this vehicle to be a CPO vehicle.

Even though she was able to communicate with me in a professional tone and manner, the many issues with vehicle including: no CPO paperwork provided as of yet, no signed contract received at dealership on day of signing, lack of respect or acknowledgement to previous emails and concerns, & providing a huge cash down payment for the vehicle, and the feeling of being taken advantage of by finance, I had a serious panic/anxiety attack after speaking with her. How hard is it for salesman/designated employee to call customer and see if they are happy with purchase or have issues? How hard is it to respond to an email or forward email  to someone who can/does respond and RESOLVE issues? How hard is it to update customer w/status of vehicle that will take longer than stated? How hard is it to not belittle, downtalk, or make satirical comments to customer and remain professional? I was also told, ""I will have Tracy give you a shout"". A shout?? Is this a professional place of business??
Such a Beautiful dealership, but it's just a cover for the ""ugliness"" waiting for you inside. BUYER BEWARE!! If I was the owner, I would definitely be embarrassed and very disappointed in my team.",1,74,0,0
3505,3341,19-Jun-18,"I purchased a lincoln mkx in 2014. at your dealership , and recently had it towed in for service , no one told me there were no loaner vehicles available. Also the service manager, Jeremy, failed to inform me that it would be two weeks before the vehicle would even be looked at.. 
 I had to get a neighbor to take me to pick it up and take it elsewhere, where it was looked at immediately, and was only the battery, and was fixed immediately.

I will never refer anyone to your dealership, and will never purchase a vehicle there.
Very poor communication and lack of customer service!

3506,3342,07-Mar-18,"I should have read the reviews before going to this dealership. They have the most unprofessional sales people I have ever met and I spoke with 3 people - ALL the same!! 
I was in the market looking for a Mustang GT and the salesperson I spoke on the phone wasn't available when I reached, so another one took over. Anyways, I knew what I wanted and I told him I wanted a GT with the 401A package/Shaker Audio/Driver Memory Seat. The person went and got another person just to tell me ""Mustangs don't come with power seats"". I was shocked that they didn't know their own cars and this is a Ford dealership. Well from there he went on to challenge me to show him a Mustang with power seats. I was surprised but kept calm and told him that I test drove a car at a different dealership with the specs. He still refused and was rude. So, I showed him one online. No apologies, nothing. He was like ""Huh, so they have it."" That's it. It is one thing to not know you vehicles, whole another level to be rude and not apologize afterwards, especially when it was your mistake. That made me realize how tough it would be to deal with them after I got the car. So, I didn't discuss any further and left. None of the 3 salespersons tried to talk to me or anything. I'm better off taking my money to a good dealership.
Well, you would want to make a large ticket purchase only at a reputed dealer with good and courteous sales people, so my advice - ""STAY AWAY"". There are a lot of Ford dealers in DFW that can give you a better service than here on any day.",1,74,0,0

455,3344,19-Feb-18,I have bought two vehicles from Grapevine Ford and everything was great but now they are engaging in faulty and deceptive advertising. Grapevine Ford post the MSRP on their website but the actual resale could be 20% higher. It is acceptable to add a premium due to demand and availability but they need to make that clear on advertising and sticker price. All other dealerships advertise true price. Very disappointed as they were very straight forward in the past.,1,74,0,0
196,3345,29-Jan-18,"Seriously worst dealership I ever had to deal with! I know going to a dealership is usually not a fun experience and they all want to get as much money out of you as possible but this place is by far the worst. First off they put amazing prices on their website for vehicles and once you call or actually go to the dealership to check it out the car is either "" just sold this past week"" or they will make up a fee and add a ridiculous amount of money to it. Oh and if your wanting to trade your car in, don't expect to get anything Kelly Blue Book, NADA, or any other online website thinks the trade in value is. Apparently they just make their own price up for that too. So, I went in there to take a look at a new 2018 mustang and trade my 2014 mustang in which has 55,000 miles, only been washed by hand, only used royal purple oil for oil changes, and I put close to $1,000 into it putting custom leather seat covers in it, adding weather tech floor mats, and tinted the windows with a lifetime guarantee. They wanted to give me $8,500 for trading it in. I told the sales rep I looked it up on Kelly Blue Book and it says the trade in value is $11,059 not including the money I put in it. He said KBB is a western company and that they use NADA. So, I looked up the NADA trade in value. The NADA clean trade in value is $11,575. Then, I was talking to a sales manager trying to negotiate a price and I told him about the NADA trade in value, and no joke he tells me they don’t use NADA to look at trade in values, they use this other website. I can’t remember what that site was called. To make this story short, we couldn't come to agreement on the trade in or the final price of the car. Two days later, I look online and find a New 2018 Ford Raptor at the same dealership for $51,080. Amazing price right! So when I called them and tried to see if they still have it in stock and see what the price was, the person I talked to said there was not any sale reps in the dealership at the moment and they would call me back as soon as one comes in. This was at 8:15 am they open at 7:00 am. That seemed kind of fishy to me.  So I had a friend of mine call them 5 minutes later, and guess who answers, a sales rep. He told my friend the vehicle is in stock, but you need to add a $10,000 fee to the MSRP sticker price, so the final price is $61,000. 45 minutes later a female sales rep gave me a call. This sales rep said the vehicle is in stock but you have to add $15,000 to the MSRP sticker price. I said why do you have to add $15,000? And no lie, she stuttered and actually took a while to come up with an excuse as to why they add that much to it. She then asked me if I wanted to come see it and I said I only wanted to come see it if I can get it for the price you advertised on your website. She then said, “Ya we can’t sell it to you for that price"". I then texted the sticker for the vehicle to the sales rep I talked to about the mustang. He texted me back saying, ""yes that vehicle is in stock"". I then texted him if he wanted to sell a truck today and sell me for the price on their website and on the sticker then I will come up there and purchase it that day. You probably guessed it he never texted me back. So if you want some advice, I would not go to this dealership. All they do is play games, make up numbers, and try to screw people over. If you see a good price online for this dealership just add a minimum of $10,000 to it and that’s the real price. Also, I would never trade my car into this place. Expect to get a couple thousand dollars less than what the trade in value should be.",1,74,1,0

First I had cracked windshield with 75 miles on new 2016 f150 so took it to service department to see if it was covered under warranty...it wasn't, but the bad part was the fact that no one greeted me, I had to go inside where no one came to see what I was there for, I finally found a service person in a cubicle talking with another service person about a personal issue and they acted as if I was putting them out by asking for their assistance. When I took my truck to Five Star Ford for a second opinion at least someone greeted me when I pulled in and immediately got someone to help me.
   Second time, I only went back because I had a coupon, was for an oil change and tire rotation. I had an appointment, but they said still a two hour wait when I arrived. I specifically asked if they top off the fluids and yes was the answer. I was checking oil two days later and saw the washer fluid was almost dry and I hadn't used any, so they didn't top off. Then a tire showed to be low and after some airing up of the tire and some logical reasoning I figured out that the display for tire pressures was not showing correct tire to be low...they had not reset the display when rotating tires...I went to Discount tire and they took care of it.

Mid-way my engine light came on, so I stopped at a dealership. They gave me an all-clear to get to Ft. Woth; however, they to9ld me to go to a certified Lincoln dealership before driving back to New Braunfels, Texas. My family drove me to Grapevine Ford Lincoln. I dealt with a certain man who was polite and courteous. He advise me to leave my Lincoln Town car which I did. It might be good to mention I have a bumper to bumper warranty.; however, I digress. The man called me later that day and told me this and that needed to be done. I was also told it would take three days to accomplish tasks. Then a few days later I was told the car was ready. I was driven back to the dealership and presented with a bill of $2,000.00. I almost choked. I wrote a check and left. I did not even drive the car during the week I remained in Ft. Worth. After a week's visit, I began to drive back to New Braunfels. I was half way there when the engine began to clatter. In addition, I noticed that my 20mpg gas mileage had dropped to 17 mpg. I phoned Grapevine and spoke to the same man. He told me I would have to return the car...some 450 miles... for them to correct issues. Instead I drove to a friend who owns the Goodyear store. His people could not find out what the Grapevine mechanics had done wrong. I presented him with the spread sheet I had been given. He then went to his computer, retrieved my complete file and said to me...""You were hosed by the Grapevine dealership."" He then meticulously went over each item showing me he had just recently done the very same work items. My health has declined considerably; however, I can advise the dealership that I intend to write a certified letter to Mr. Carl Sewel whom I believe owns that dealership. If anyone reads this and is concerned, they may have the general manager contact me personally to refund every single cent of my transaction. I do not intend to speak with anyone other than the overall dealership manager... or Mr. Sewel If I do not hear anything within ten days, a certified letter will be sent to the owner/partners.

Unfortunately, I cannot say that my experience has been positive at all.  I am a recent widow with a one year old and made the difficult decision to trade in my husband’s vehicle.  I not only wanted something larger with more safety features, this was also a fresh start for my daughter and me; it was not merely a choice made out of necessity but also a highly emotional decision. After much research I decided on the Mazda CX-9 and weeks of internet shopping led me to Freeman Mazda, a mere 400 miles away from my home in New Mexico.  The second day I had the vehicle the service soon light came on. The third day my cousin decided it would be a good idea to check the oil to make sure that was not why the light was coming on.  When he popped the hood he found that one of the battery cables had been chewed through by a rodent.  He told me I had enough connection that driving would be ok, but that I needed to take it in and get the cable replaced.  I in no way thought this would be a major problem, and when I took it to the closest Mazda dealer I was shocked to find out that it would be a $4,000 fix and that the interior of my car would need to be dismantled in order to replace the wiring.  And that it would not be covered under warranty since it was considered external damage not caused by faulty equipment.  I immediately called Freeman Mazda to see if there was anything that could be done and was told that they would need to call me back. I waited over the weekend and called back and was told that they needed to discuss what could be done since I lived so far away.  I waited a couple of days and called back and left a message with no reply.  I have had the worst year of my life dealing with my husband’s passing and chalked this all up to just one more thing to add to how horrible these past few months have been.  My aunt decided to act as an advocate on my behalf and contacted the dealership.  She gave my information and I did receive a phone call and a promise of a call back on Monday.  It is now close to midnight on Monday and I again have received no phone call. I now have a brand-new vehicle with $4,000 worth of damage and no one cares.

BMW Arlington
I took my 2006 BMW 650I convertible to BMW Arlington for an oil change and to diagnose a problem with the GPS and a seat belt sensor. I spoke to Joshua Boller Service Consultant, this man was super nice and very helpful, an unbelievable employee. 
BMW Arlington had my car for 2 days, the service was done to my car and I was given several quotes for repair work for different things. One, I was informed that I had an oil leak from the front upper oil pan and given a $1750.00 quote to repair this leak.  Another, I was given a $1400.00 quote to repair some wiring that had been “cut” I was told. I declined those repairs as it is an older car with more than 100,000 miles on it so I didn’t want to put that kind of money into it. I drove the car very little over the next few months, watching the oil level when I did use it. 
On 2/16/2017, a friend that owns an auto repair shop and I were talking and he said let’s put your BMW on the lift and see that oil leak. I took it to his shop and watched him lift the car. Under the car you could see oil spray down the center of the car and oil dripping from the front of the engine. He shined a flashlight up and you could clearly see the oil coming from the front of the valve covers, dripping down the engine. He said “That’s not an upper oil pan leak”. He took the car off of the lift and removed the air breather cover and clearly visible was oil coming from the front of the valve covers. He showed me where 3 bolts on each valve cover were loose and where a socket had knocked the dust from the bolts and all 6 bolts were loosened to allow oil to leak from the covers. He tightened these bolts and cleaned the oil from the engine and “Presto” NO MORE OIL LEAK.
He also looked in the trunk, (Something I hadn’t done) and showed me where the wiring harness to the trunk lid had several wires cut. These were exposed and the rubber protection covers had been cut away and were lying in the trunk. All of the plastic rivets were removed and missing.   All of the trunk interior covers were removed and hanging loose. NONE of this was that way when I took my car to BMW. 
I was so disturbed by what I had seen. My friend said it looked to him like the wiring and oil leak were done on purpose to cause the oil leak and run up the price at BMW. He suggested that I go to BMW and talk to the service manager because if someone that worked for him had done that he would want to know and he would fire them.
On 02/17/2017, I went to BMW Arlington and walked in and talked to Joshua Boller. I had him look up the quotes and informed him of what had occurred and he assured me that he did not believe that anyone at BMW would have done that. I said that as a courtesy to the dealership I wanted to bring it to their attention. I DIDN’T WANT ANYTHING, I was disturbed by what I had seen for myself and felt that going there and informing them was a courtesy to them because they may have a problem and don’t know it. I didn’t want someone else to be a victim. Had I blindly authorized the work, it would have cost more than $4000.00. I asked him to get the service manager so I could talk to him and he did.
I do not remember the man’s name when he introduced himself to me as the Service Manager, because he immediately gave me attitude. I relayed the story to him and he all but called me a liar, he even insisted “I’m not calling you a liar, but that didn’t happen here.” I told him NO ONE ELSE HAS BEEN IN THAT CAR EXCEPT BMW. He said even the suggestion of what I was saying was “repulsive”. I told him that I was just informing them to be alert because they may have a problem that they were not aware of. He was extremely curt and rude. Nothing like how I had been treated by ALL of the other employees at BMW that I had spoken to. He told me that he had looked up who had worked on my car and said HE is “One of my team leaders”, I do spot checks on all of my people and they do excellent work and no one would risk their “$100,000.00 job to do that, they all do excellent work”.
I asked him to come to my car parked outside and I showed him inside the trunk where everything is disconnected and removed lying in the trunk and asked I asked him “Is this the kind of excellent work your team leader does?” He simply turned and walked away. I then left the dealership.
I have never been treated like this before and was embarrassed that I had even involved Joshua Boller, he is an excellent employee. I believe he was embarrassed as well and I apologize to him here for even involving him. 
The service manager was arrogant, rude, condescending, and should be reprimanded. Had this man simply said thank you for the information and stated he would look into it they would still have a customer, but he didn’t.
I have seen people with hundreds, even thousands of dollars in their pocket caught shoplifting, most of the time for minor items! Why would they do that? Who knows? If this service manager is so naïve to think that there is not a possibility that someone working there could have done this, then HE should be replaced.
I am convinced after personally looking at the evidence and seeing what they tried to sell me in repairs that someone at BMW is doing something they shouldn’t be doing in service and repairs. Was the oil leak “created”? Were the wires cut there? Is this a “One person issue” or does it go deeper? 
I paid more than $500.00 for the diagnosis and feel like I was taken advantage of. I will never use BMW Arlington again and will provide my story and opinion to all that will listen.
Don’t blindly accept huge repair bills, get a second opinion, it saved me thousands of dollars.
I have posted this because I feel that everyone should be aware of ALL OF THE INFORMATION.

3655,3509,02-Jul-18,"I am submitting my experience as a loyal customer of Don Herring for 15 plus years, having owned 4 Mitsubishi vehicles – 

On Sunday, June 24th my 2018 Eclipse Cross sunroof glass blew out while I was driving the vehicle.  I pulled off the highway to inspect what happened and found no trace of debris that would have hit the sunroof glass causing it to explode.  I had to drive home on side streets due to the air/wind from the open sunroof, with broken glass I sent a text to the sales rep, Mr. Flores, that sold me the car and he responded that he believed the issue would be covered under warranty.  I text him back I would bring the car in tomorrow morning.  

On Monday, June 25th I took my car in for service regarding the issue and spoke to Mr. Hernandez.  I asked for a loaner car, but not an option, however, was offered a complimentary rental car through Enterprise.  The challenge with Enterprise is I must provide personal insurance or pay additional for daily insurance coverage through Enterprise.  The service associate  showed concern for the issue and checked my car in for service.  I was advised the issue would need to be investigated to determine plausible cause and next steps.  I called sales rep who advised he needed to speak with the service team and he would call back me back within 20 minutes.  That was a week ago and Mr. Flores did not call me back.  

On Tuesday, June 26th (or Wednesday, June 27th) the service associate advised pictures and details had been sent to Mitsubishi.  The final determination after investigation was the sunroof glass had indeed cracked and exploded from the INSIDE OUT – this could have been due to the glass manufacture had faulty glass that was not properly tempered for hot and cold climates – there have been no other reports of this concern as of last week.  I was reassured the sunroof glass and components would be replaced new and covered under warranty.  As well, the parts would arrive by Friday, June 29th and my car would be ready by Monday, July 2nd.  At this time I am awaiting a call to confirm I can pick up my car.

I would have thought with the chain of events and investigation by Mitsubishi the Don Herring sales manager, service manager or someone in a management role would have taken the time to make a courtesy call to me regarding this issue as a longtime customer.  Unfortunately, that has not happened and I have been without my new vehicle for 7 days as of yesterday (July 1st) and it has been in the care and service of Don Herring.

3666,3521,25-Feb-20,"Melissa, I drove nearly two hours to see this car. I brought cash with me and was prepared to drive away with it. It was totally a bait and switch. They did not have this car on the lot, or at least did not let me see it. 

There are a couple things about the lot that I think you should know:
1. The lot was very dark, not at all like a car lot to show off the cars. The walkways were not illuminated well.

2. The doors to the building were not clearly marked. I was not sure which door to enter. The text on the door was reversed so that it could be read from the inside. I just entered the door that was not being guarded by guys sitting on the ground.

3. We were greeted by a sales person who said we could not speak with you. She said that you were not a sales person and did not have the ability to work with me.

4. There were guys just sitting on the sidewalk near the side door. I do not know who they were, I assumed they were mechanics or make-ready personnel, but they could have been anybody. Combined with the poor lighting, I felt unsafe at the used car center.

5. Why was it important for me to show a picture ID before the sales person could talk with me. I had not asked to drive the car yet.

6. Outdated sales techniques were used. The bait and switch is so old and inappropriate. The sales person said she would go get the car an pull it up to the from so we could see it, and then another guy came in to tell us of other similar cars on the lot. Then the supervisor came in and told us the car was not on the lot. 


I understand that you cannot hold a car for me without any earnest money. You told me over the phone that the car had just arrived. I told you that I was coming in at 7:30 to see the car, and you said that you would be there. You were not there and neither was the car. It would have been courteous to give me a call to let me know the car had already been sold. It would have saved me the two hour trip to your store. 

Overall, the used car center at South Houston Nissan was not pleasant. Lawyers, dentists, and used car salesmen have a notorious reputation for unpleasant experiences, my experience last night reinforced this fact. I have purchased my last five used cars from individuals. My experience last night at South Houston Nissan reminded me why I stopped going to used car lots.

In a nutshell: my wife took her Altima in to diagnose a warning light for the airbag.  They charged us $185 for the diagnosis and gave us an estimate of almost $5000.  We took it for a second opinion to another dealership and (drum roll): the problem was a disconnected plug.  Literally a plug needed to be reconnected.  Problem solved.  

We called service to ask for a partial refund of the $185, since it was completely wrong.  They refused, and said they'd give us an oil change and a pair of wiper blades.  Needless to say, we're not taking our car to them for service, even an oil change.",1,79,0,0

3675,3531,13-Nov-19,"WORST experience EVER! (See Photos).I have not ever been so rudely disrespected. I'm still in shock!

Online I came across 2 Nissan Sentra S. A NEW 2019 for $15.5k & a USED 2019 grey/silver for $14k. My reservation was for Saturday 11/9/19 at 6pm. I went in around 1:30p. When I arrived; I was greeted by Rashad & his trainee.

I gave Rashad both ads from THEIR website. As we're going over features; the S model didn't have keyless entry, but SV model did. I was sold immediately (I had 0 desire for the drawn out 'test drive'). This is not my first time buying/trading a vehicle. I have my own APPROVED financing; all I needed was car info & final price. 

He comes back w/ the price marked up to $20.5k (CONVENIENTLY w/o $2.6k dealer discount), & only Nissan $2k rebate =18.5k but ADDS Wheel locks & Nitro-$599, EPP-$1,899, & Tint-$499=2,997. $22k BEFORE TTL! I'm NOT paying $3k for wheel locks on a Nissan, AIR in tires, a GLORIFIED wax/wash & a OVERPRICED window tint.

I kindly advised him that I didn't need nor want any of those things & showed him FOUR 2019 Nissan SV CURRENTLY listed on THEIR website for $15,681. Here is where things go downhill fast. Rashad leaves & a sales manager returns to reiterate the add ons come w/ it. If it 'comes' w/ it; it would be INCLUDED in the LISTING price. I leave telling him that if the car is not $15,681 w/ said 'add ons'; no deal.

I return a few hours later, they persisted w/ the add-ons & I left again. FACTORY made cars DON'T ""come"" w/ DEALER add-ons! They're ""dealer add-ons"" because the MANUFACTURER DOESN'T offer them as purchase options;otherwise you'd have to upgrade or wait for a CUSTOM made car..FROM the MANUFACTURER!!

Monday, I was still interested in the model & decided to reach out to the GM via reply email/# provided in a 'welcome' email. NO RESPONSE the ENTIRE day. Today, OC contacts me & during the conversation, I QUOTE VERBATIM, ""We do not have to list them."" YES YOU DO! If they are NOT listed as MANUFACTURE INCLUDED FEATURES they are OPTIONAL! It is in FACT ILLEGAL to NOT list them & force the charges to the customer! I then spoke to customer specialist Ashley. 3rd time is a charm, right?

I was UTTERLY & COMPLETELY WRONG. I get there & met Leo. He pulls my file & says the GM would come speak w/me. I was NOT met w/the GM (Chad Milow); instead it was a sales director, Roger. He shows me where they have marked the add-ons down to $400 (coincidence?). I tell him they have 16 Sentra SV on their lot. ONE of them is pure factory. He tells me no; which I know is a LIE. 16 customers added the EXACT same add-ons that were outsourced & DIDN'T purchase? Add-ons CANNOT be put on a FACTORY car until the car is SOLD! 

I call Nissan corporate to verify. He gets PISSED, SNATCHES the paper, walks off, & tells me to & I QUOTE VERBATIM ""Go purchase at the other dealership then! Why are you here?"" Excuse me?

I could not believe my eyes nor my ears! I politely walked to the front desk to ask his information. Leo returns & I explain to him what just happened, how rude & disrespectful that was. Leo tells me I can't call competition to ask about the same car & that the director doesn't want to 'deal w/ that'. Excuse me? The ONLY reason he doesn't want to deal w/ it because he KNEW he was LYING. As a BUSINESS you get customers by market competing! That is literally the model of business no matter what industry you are in!

I presume while I was headed home; they talked. Leo reached out & said they would do the deal if I accepted the numbers offered by the director. I told him I didn't get a clear look at everything, because the director snatched the paper so fast. NO RESPONSE. The ONLY way I would still purchase from here is IF I got the Sentra SV at listing price & a match on my trade-in. Other than that; I would NEVER DO BUSINESS HERE & I advise ANYONE else to NOT do it either. That is no way to treat NEW or any customer for that matter.",1,79,0,0

205,3535,26-Jun-19,"I purchased a vehicle from this dealership on 06/06/2019 at the time of my test drive I noticed the air was not blowing cold.  My salesmen Jeffery stated if purchased he would have the ac checked in which he did.  The vehicle was purchased in good faith with a “We Owe You” document issued to have the AC check/charged.  The vehicle was left at the dealership to have AC checked and inspection completed.  Originally the car did not pass inspection but the dealer corrected the issue to pass the state inspection.  On 06/12/2019 I was contacted to take delivery of the vehicle.  Vehicle was pick up and I immediately noticed the air was not getting cold the car was returned to the dealership, the salesmen once again stated he would have the car checked and assured me that the service department had checked it before.  On 06/17/2019 I contacted the dealership to get a status up because I has heard nothing on my vehicle.  At that time, I was notified that too much money had been lost on this deal and they were not going to put out any more money; I was offered my money back because it was a cash deal.  
Problem 1: The car was parked on the indoor showroom sales floor with a promise that a complete inspection had been done. This was clearly a miss on the Service Department that initially serviced the vehicle not to mention the total cost of service was reflected on the buyers’ order.  I decided to keep the car and took delivery on of vehicle on 06/20/2019.  I picked vehicle up at 3:00 pm and went an auto mechanic who completed AC work in less than 1.5 hours and $400.

3680,3537,22-Jun-19,"UPDATE: Emailed James, owner loyalty manager, and received a call from him on 6/24.  He fully supports the technician’s recommendations.  None of the charge will be refunded.  When questioned specifically about 2 “critical” recommendations, he provided the following answers: 1) How did the tech determine the transmission fluid level was low when the next shop found it to be normal?  James referenced the a picture of the outside of what I assume is the transmission attached to the repair recommendation.  The “splatters” is what indicated to the tech that the fluid level was low.  2) One “critical” recommendation was to replace both the engine and in cabin air filters.  When informed that both had been replaced approx. 13,000 miles ago, James stated that Nissan recommends both filters be replaced every 3,000 miles.  Per my Altima maintenance schedule, it’s 15,000 miles for the in cabin and 30,000 miles for the engine.  Obviously, James is not a “certified Nissan technician”.  However, if this is how the dealership and Nissan train their technicians and owner loyalty managers to make and defend “critical” recommendations, perhaps I need to rethink what vehicle I will purchase next.

Do not take your car here for service.  Took my 2013 Altima in to have them check a noise that might be coming from the transmission.  They replaced the transmission under warranty less than 2 yrs, 36000 miles ago.  Charged me 1 hr of labor ($160+$24 shop fee) for 30 mins of work and said the transmission needed to be replaced for ~$4500 - low fluid level and leaking.  Also recommended another ~$2300 in critical maintenance/repairs, most of which had been been done by my mechanic within the last year.  Took the car for a 2nd opinion at a shop that specializes in transmissions - fluid levels fine, no codes, no noise they could hear, drove fine, some possible seepage but no leak.  Recommendation was to just keep an eye on it - no charge for this.  Have contacted the dealership multiple times asking for refund - general manager, client care manager, service manager - no response.  This is the 2nd time they have recommended unnecessary, expensive repairs.  Do not take your vehicle here for service unless you want to pay a premium for unneeded repairs.",1,79,0,0

206,3541,22-Mar-19,"We have be purchasing fleet of NV2500 vans from Central Houston Nissan past couple of years.  We have about 12 NV2500 in our fleet.  Every single one of the van have had warranty issues with catalytic converter and fuel pumps.  I am amazed how Nissan has not issued a recall on this yet.  For the most part Central Nissan has taken care of my warranty issues until today.  This NV van had 60K miles and I was told by service adviser Anthony that its out of warranty since the catalytic converter has a 50K mile warranty.  I explained to him all my other van had the same issues.  He advised me the cost will be around $3500 for repairs.  Knowing this is an ongoing issue with these vans I wondered why wouldn't NISSAN warranty this one on good faith.  Anthony suggested that if I had done their recommended fuel service then this wouldn't have happened(this angered me more then the $3500 bill)   I told him I even had brought the same vehicle in around 30K miles and had service adviser David Navarro check on the same issues.  He assured me nothing was wrong with this one and noted on my account if the issue arise after warranty that he would take care of it.  After I complained and told them the situation was documented in my account prior to the expiration of my warranty,  they offered to pay 80% of the cost to repair.  I don't understand that if they admit guilt and will pay 80%, why don't they pay the entire balance.  This is obviously a defect and should be a nationwide recall.  But instead of taking ownership of the problem, Nissan tries to pass the cost to consumers. THIS SHOULD NOT BE TOLERATED.  I will continue to send this message to anyone in Nissan that will take my concern seriously.  This will be posted to all Nissan social media account until I get a response.

Worst experience ever!  Stay far away !!!!

The sale price was not the actual price. They added $4000.00 on top of the sale price and call it pre delivery cost. I never see any dealer has this fees before.

3705,3564,02-Jun-18,"We wanted to buy a BMW they have for sale and talked to the sales agent Jay Long, who was very nice and professional. After test driving the car we sat down with Jay and counter offered 20K just to see what their offer going to be. As usual Jay went to talk to the manager, and in walks in Mr. Dario Camachi. He brought in a paper with a break down of the car which has the asking price of 23K plus they added 3000(!!!) to certify the car. after tax and title it comes to 28K plus. First of all they never showed us the breakdown of the car then when he heard the counter offer, he stood up and extended his hand and thank us for coming in!!!! First of all as a consumer i can counter offer the price and as a sales agent they can counter offer as well. He just didnt do any of that and showed us the door. We were there to buy a BMW and we had all the credential to get that car. You cannot rudely show the customer the door just because you didn't agree with the price they offered. When my wife protested his behavior, he told her that she's been loud and there are other customers at the premises. At that point we told him we didnt wanted to deal with him and if he can send someone else, because we were still interested to purchase the car. But whoever Mr. Dario sent to attend us, he pretty much showed the same deal and didnt wanted to make any counter offer less than 26K. At that point we walked out the dealership.

464,3568,25-Feb-18,"I went to trade in my car yesterday at this dealership. Evan was my car salesperson and he was pleasant to work with. I was comfortable with him. He did his job. He was helpful. It was great. Better than I expected out of a car salesperson. 
My experience was pleasant until I was taken to the financing department. I was introduced to Darrell Polk. He tried pressuring me REALLY hard to buy their dealership warranty for my new car. Which made no sense Due to the fact that it’s still under the factory warranty. He tried to convince me otherwise though. I’ll spare some of the details, but I basically kept telling him “no”. After about the 6th or 10th time asking, changing the price, and getting denied his tone and attitude changed.  He would murmur things under his breath, such as how he was trying to help me out and basically shaming me the majority of the time I was in his office for not choosing to purchase their dealership warranty. He would do obnoxious things like slam his pen down on the desk or aggressively pull apart the paperwork after I’d finished signing each document. It got to the point where I felt extremely uncomfortable and wanted to leave. He’d completely rubbed me the wrong way. He was rude. He made it hard for me to even enjoy driving my new car off the lot, because of the treatment I got from him. Maybe this all wouldn’t have been so bad if i hadn't had to go to this place by myself. 
So, once I’m done with Darrell Polk, I go into a waiting room and wait for them to bring me my keys. Then I’m told to pull up Central Houston Nissan on google on my phone and they asked me to write a review right there on the spot because the manager or whom ever was in charge was expecting to see it or something like that. I couldn’t understand why they were literally trying to make me write a review before I’d even received my car. I just looked down at my phone screen and couldn’t help but feel pressured to write something positive. I felt like I was being monitored? It was weird. I think they were expecting me to write the review and show it to them for approval before I left. They finally told me I could go ahead and write it later after they could see that I was annoyed/confused for being asked that and not willing to comply. I told them I’d needed time to process and would do it later, so here I am. I wanted to do an honest review and it wasn’t going to happen right there. 
I really hope they aren’t doing this to other female customers. 

To sum up my experience at this dealer:
-Evan (car salesperson) he’s excellent at his job! No complaints!

-Finance department (Darrell Polk), terrible! 0/10  Had I known it was going to be that way I probably would’ve never come to this place. 

-Whoever told their employee to come tell me to write a review right then and there, GARBAGE!

It makes me question how many of these “positive” reviews were from customers that were told to write theirs on the spot too. Never doing this again. I don’t feel right recommending this place to others, so I won’t. ",1,79,0,0

I should have known something was amiss. He started asking about payments, etc. I told him I didn't know if I even wanted to buy yet, I needed to see and drive the vehicle. Finally we go and drive it. He obviously knew nothing about it because he could not answer any of my questions. I knew way more about it than he did. I still was going to purchase it for my son, it was a nice jeep at a decent price. We go back to the office and he says ""the bank has a counter offer, they want $5000 down, a cosigner, or need you to trade a vehicle."" This is when I got upset. I told him I would not have wasted my entire day, driven 4 hours, etc if I had know that. Why did they tell me I was already approved? He says ""sorry for the misunderstanding.

I suspected it was and even called their call center and front desk to verify  and they both appeared to say it was true. I should have known it was a fake, the call center they use was rude, careless, and even hung up the phone. 

I've contacted their upper management like Chris Gates, Chad Millow, and J. Leon as well as their owners and even Nissan consumer affairs to complain about their lying sales director/manager but they avoided my calls and refused to take responsibility. A sales manager I spoke to at the dealership even lied and gave me incorrect contact information for upper management even after I confirmed it with him.  I in vain, even tried reaching their customer service manager and he ended up doing nothing as well. He did reach out to upper management, but they didn't want anything to do with it or resolve a customer's issue.

They waive this fee for some customers and won't budge.  So a price protection certificate will do you no good.

Look up specifically for Used Car Sales for Central Houston Nissan. Also when came to finance paperwork there were additional fees that were added on top of final numbers not your normal TTL.

Good afternoon Mr. xxxxxx,
 
This is Jerrell Price from Central Houston Nissan, we spoke earlier today on the phone.  I apologize for the delay but I was making sure we found the right vehicle with the features you are looking for.  I need to ask you a few questions about the Altima you're looking for.  Did you want the Technology package on the vehicle?  If so, I have one in pearl white.  The invoice price which is the price the dealership owns the car for is $34,034. The MSRP is $35,895 plus tax title and license. I can sell you the vehicle at the invoice price of $34,700 minus the rebates which is $3,000 bringing the vehicle price down to $31,700 plus your tax, title, and license.  In this situation I want to earn your business and take care of our law enforcement.  Down worry about the price of the tax, title, and license.  For you it will just be $31,700 drive out.  If you want the Altima SL without the Technology package, then your drive out will be $30,656.  It was a pleasure speaking with you earlier.  Give me a call and let me know what I can do to earn your business.

I am in sales myself and thought that maybe the line of communication had been dropped but still gave them a chance. I test drove the car and it was closing time because I live an hour away and work but the sales man Mark M. had me take the car home and come back the next day -  again this is not at all convenient being that I live an hour one way from the location of dealership and also drive an hour the opposite direction to work . I took car home and it was not even half way home that I realized I was not going to buy the car due to it being extremely hard uncomfortable seats and with my commute to work that is not what I want to pay a car note for . I called the sales man the next morning to inform him that after work I would be bringing the car back and not keeping it, So when I got there he had another vehicle a Mercedes Benz ML 350 pulled out for me to drive after my test drive he told me to take it home and we would talk again after the holiday weekend which means I was to take it home for 3 days. My mom fell in love with the car and I told her that they had two of them to buy so when Tuesday came around me and her went up there so she could also test drive the other one. I was told by my sales man Mark that he would be able to lower the price of the car and especially since we were now purchasing not one car but 2. He lied, everything he told us he was going to work out for us ended up not being true after we went to the financing department. My co-signer has actually been illegally added as a buyer for the car and they ran so many hard credit pulls that it took a huge toll on both our credit scores. My mom was told that she still had a warranty for another 20,000 miles by Mark but then found out that she did  not when at finance which means that she had to now purchase one which raised the price of the car yet again. They were supposed to send me a copy of the financial papers and sale of car since they had to come out to my co-signers house to get his signature yet even though I have called I still have not a single piece of paperwork about my car. The windshield was to be serviced for the crack in it and I was told any problems my mechanic found they would take care of, well both my car and my moms car needed new tires and brakes and they have not returned my call and told my mom they would do hers but then only honored the brakes being fixed. 
This place rushed us through every aspect of the sale and they were very unprofessional and misinformed about their inventory. They will lie, cheat, and scam their customers to make a sale instead of treating them right and keeping them as customers for life. What a horrible way to run a business. This is exactly why people hate sales people and give ""SALES MEN AND SALES WOMEN A BAD NAME""  I AM IN NEW HOME SALES AND FIND THIS TYPE OF CUSTOMER SERVICE TO BE REPULSIVE. ",1,79,0,0
3732,3596,21-Feb-17,"A friend asked me to help them and co-sign for a vehicle.  They came to my home with sales person (Tommy Cunningham) and paperwork,  when reviewing paperwork I noticed only my name was on the paperwork,  when I asked about this the Tommy about it, he informed me the other persons paperwork was at dealership but he would email me copies.  Can't believe I feel for this but I did. At the toward the end I learned they had not obtained insurance.  Tommy gave his word no keys would be given till they showed proof.  He said that the dealership would cover the vehicle till they did but I insisted no keys till proof which he agreed.  He took a copy of my insurance to as he said show the finance company that I'm a responsible person. 
This is all I heard till about two weeks later when I got a call from my insurance company that the vehicle was in an accident.  I came to dealership to find out why they gave the keys without my authorization and I was informed that Tommy Cunningham is no longer with them. His supervisor stated they had numerous similar complaints against him.
Clearly I was was dumb for believing Tommy but at same time Tommy Cunningham did lie. There was no other paperwork,  I am the only person on the contract and therefore he should not have given the keys cause I clearly instructed him not to.
My insurance did cover the car and made the repairs so all is good there but I had no choice but to surrender the vehicle back to the bank, but been sitting here for over an hour and a half now because I am being refused help to get reimbursed for the gap and extended warranty.  One person came out and said I have to come at hours I'm not available to come in yet they are open.

This place does not sell cars, it is a place that lies to the customer. They will try their best to trick you into paying more money for the price of the car than you agree to.

We were interested in one car, and the manager agreed to a total price of $23,800 drive out (which included tax, license, documentary charge and fees). But when they did the paperwork, the finance person added an extra $ 1,429.28 which was never acknowledged by us and meanwhile he offered several additional warranties to let us buy, to draw our attention away from this extra charge.


The following is what we are agreed to for pricing
Drive out (including tax, license, documentary charge and fees)	$23,977.19 
trade in car	($7,800)
Extend service	$926 
Maintenance package	$480

Since we had our two year old son with us, my husband and I had to alternate talking to the finance person which he took advantage of.  He never showed us a detailed breakdown of the charges. He just told me that my husband could sign the paperwork when he brought my son back from the  restroom. Because we had a trade in car, had some financing, and bought some additional warranties, and had up to a $1500 rebate, my husband was unable to calculate an exact number so he truly believed the finance person. Although, he didn't show us any paper work or explain in any detail for the charges and just rushed my husband to sign the paperwork.  

After my husband signed the paper work and drove the new car home, we found one indicator light was on, then I asked  to have it checked out. I obviously couldn't buy a brand new car that already had problems. But the salesman just told us to drive a little longer and the light would go away, but it never went off. 

We went home to have dinner and this was when we realized that the invoice amount they charged was not what they told us. My husband immediately went  back to dealership to ask for a refund of the additional charge and they told him their boss was not there now but they would  give us back at least $500 on Monday, which was the next  business day. 

But on Monday, when my husband contacted them they rejected to refund the overcharge amount and said your wife agreed to pay this amount. This is such a big lie. They never showed any paper work to me. I only asked the finance person why they offered 0 percent financial rates and still charge 3.99% of interest rate to us?  Then the finance person said either you can chose $1500 rebate with 3.99% rate or no rebate with 0 % interest rate. The finance person also suggested we choose the $1,500 rebate with 3.99% than taking no rebate with 0 % interest rate. So I chose $1,500 rebate with 3.99% interest rate, therefore we should have SUBTRACTED $1500 from our drive out amount ( $23,800) but they ADDED $ 1,429.28 first AND then deducted $1,500 AND also charge 3.99% of interest rate. We ended up with a rebate of only $70.72. This is trick they are playing.

1. The dealership used the new brake down amount instead of the agreed drive out price to confuse what is the exact price. (They never showed us the breakdown of the pricing before we signed the paper work)

2. The dealership is  mixing up the car price with finance promotion. (to avoid giving us the real $1500 rebate)

Now with the over charge and also the new car itself having problems, we asked for a full refund all money. They rejected again even with the warranty printed on the back of Power Nissan’s service invoice. According to Nissan’s own warranty, Nissan should replace or refund my car. 

I just want to tell all the people that want to buy a Nissan, save yourself the hassle and lies, and never go to Central Houston Nissan dealership.

3737,3603,30-Jan-17,"6 months ago, I went into a Nissan dealership to “trade-in” my car for a new one. We went through the whole process, signed necessary paperwork left under the impression that I received a new car through a trade-in. Much to my surprise about a month later I began getting calls from the loan company stating that I was past due on my monthly payment. I was confused so I called the dealership and spoke to the financial manager who informed me that the car was not traded in and that he has no idea where the car was. I spoke to the floor manager and inquired as to what was going on, he informed me there was nothing he could do because I ""made a deal with the dealer so I would have to work things out with him"". After that conversation, I called Nissan’s corporate office who informed me that things would have to be worked out with the local dealership because they only handle ""manufacture problems"". Everyone I spoke to was dismissive as if this wasn’t a problem. Frustrated at this point I spoke with the initial salesman who says that him leasing the car until it is re-financed was always a part of the plan and never trading it in. Thinking I had no other option because I could not afford to pay for two cars I agreed to allow him to lease for a few months until ""the buyer's credit was high enough"". That never happened and then I find out that he was trying to lease the car to someone else but they aren't paying the payments and it is overdue by $1900. Long story short, I recently got the car back, after MUCH hassle, however, I will NEVER return to this dealership or any other Nissan dealership to purchase a vehicle from them. They didn’t even have the courtesy to investigate the case and speak with me about the situation. Not professional at all!",1,79,0,0
211,3604,25-Jan-17,"So my biggest complaint (and most obvious lesson) is READ EVERY SINGLE WORD  that you are initialing for. I have an extended warranty and was told that I would have to pay a deductible for any WORK that would be COMPLETED. I waited 25 minutes and had to make it to work, so like any employee (regardless of time/paperwork needed to be done) he summarized what the steps/procedures would be. I am not going to name this new employee that went over this paperwork (I know that he was new because when I called to speak to him the operator told me so because they couldn't find his extension in the first place and even said he was a new employee) but he is not at fault for this. He told me that since I was going through my extended warranty, that I would have to pay a deductible, which is typically normal. We both went over my paperwork that I actually had with me and it would be $100 that I would be paying and the warranty would cover the rest. Please note - I went in for a check engine light and my brake light blinking. After being rear-ended twice in the last three months (covering the cost of one person having no insurance) plus paying for $800 in tires (no, this is not their problem) I specifically said that I needed an estimate before accepting any work that would be done with my vehicle because unfortunately, I couldn't hand over a credit card and pay for whatever was needed. He let me know that the WORK (if covered under warranty) would be my $100 deductible and obviously the warranty would cover the rest. After receiving a quote of over $1,500 (for other reasons that I went in for) I let the new employee know that I would have to pick up my car and think about how would I proceed with everything. When I went to pick up my vehicle, I was told that since my car was diagnosed and the ""problems"" they found were not covered by my warranty, that there would be a $162 charge JUST to diagnose my car. Unfortunately, they had me sign the initial conversation where they spoke briefly about covering the cost of my deductible when there was WORK involved. I didn't see this fine print, or was I told, that I would have to cover a $162 cost of my car simply being looked at regardless of even being worked on and regardless of if my warranty covered the simple diagnosis of my warranty covering it or not. They stated that if my car had been diagnosed with ""warranty"" issues that it would've only charged me the $62 because my warranty would cover the other $100 because of my deductible. However, since my car was diagnosed with issues that had nothing to do with my warranty, I would have to be pay $162 even though work had not be done. I spoke to a manger very confused that this charge was happening. The only positive is that he did waive the fee, after a lot of arguing, but he felt the need to tell me that I shouldn't be upset for this reason - I was going into the shop ""knowing"" (?) that I would have to pay a $100 deductible IF warranty work had been done only to find out that my ""issues"" weren't covered under my extended warranty that I purchased and I would have to pay an additional $62 than what I would have originally planned. As if knowing that when my check engine light came on, I knew if it were warranty or not??? He didn't understand why that would be upsetting in the first place. Their entire argument was that I had a signature.  I then took it to another shop to find out that I didn't have any of the ""issues"" that they had said I had in my quote. Please be careful, which should be a no-brainer in the first place - Read EVERY SINGLE word that is on the document. After even apologizing that I was frustrated in the first place, the manager still went on to say he couldn't understand my frustration for paying an extra ""$62"" because I would've had to pay for that initial deductible from my warranty. It's the principle. I've been in customer service for 10+ years and know that you don't talk to customers that way. Not only dealing with two car accidents where I was read-ended and t-boned (both not my fault) and dealing with medical bills... $62 is still more than what I had mentally prepared myself for. I am thankful that this manager waived the fee but I am extremely disappointed in the way he handled himself and had to point out why an additional amount would be such a problem with me. This post is to educate the people, that I see initial paperwork on a daily basis, with only knowing a summary of what it is told to them by the employees that give it to them, and to educate the people who are in a hurry to go to their jobs where they are struggling with feeding their kids/paying medical bills/etc.- This is a business. That's understood. Please remember that and read and educate yourself as much as possible so that you are not financially hurt by people running that business. I will completely admit that I am at fault for initialing paperwork that I thought was ""summarized"" by this new employee while I was in a hurry to get to work.... but please take your time, read between the lines, know what you're paying for and ask the right questions.

She had no idea what she was talking - I only found that out once I started working with Heather.  Heather then told me I could get the 0% financing through Nissan, but I wasn't eligible for the Nissan Cash (now the price is ~$49K).  When I went to sign my paperwork for my new vehicle, the finance guy (can't remember his name) told I could get the 0% financing through Nissan, but the not all the discounts Heather told me I could get.  NOW the price of the truck is well over $50K.  In the short span of an hour, the truck I wanted went from $44K to over $50K.  Talk about a bait and switch.  So, I'm still at the dealership and faced with a decision; do I take the high-priced bait and switch offer to get 0% from Nissan, or do I get my own loan though my bank to get the original $44K online offer?  While I'm crunching the numbers and determining the benefit of 0% (with a higher priced truck) or a substantially lower priced truck (with a loan from my bank), the General Manager (GM) decides to run my credit (hard credit pull).  I called my bank (not knowing what the General Manager was doing) and spoke with them about my loan application - I negotiated a MUCH better rate (2.69%) than when I checked the rates earlier in the morning.

3878,3781,03-Nov-18,"Last Saturday, I purchased a 2017 Nissan Rogue from the Hyundai Used Car dealership (World Car Nissan Hyundai North in San Antonio, TX). It had 8163 miles on it and 1 owner. The sales rep, Akeem Mercer, did a perfectly fine job and the process itself is not necessarily the issue, although I walked in with an approval of 3.79% and they assured me they could match that interest rate. When I got to the finance side of the house, the interest rate jumped to 3.94%. I could have sat there another hour or 2 to get my percentage rate but I was willing to overlook the ""mistake"".

My issue has to do with the service after the sale. When I had the car delivered and the keys handed over to me (Intelligent keys), I realized there was only 1 set. Recognizing that should the battery die or we lose this set, my wife could be stranded with no way to get the car going, I immediately reached out to the rep via text who stated he would look for a 2nd set. He later replied that there was no other set and he could ""order one for me for a couple hundred"". I was shocked at this point. Why was this becoming my problem? I then looked in the glove box for what to do if we did have a non-functional set of keys and there was no Owners Manual.

The following Monday, I got an email from the store Sale Manager:

""As a manager here at World Car Hyundai North I wanted to make sure your expectations have been met.   Has my team answered all of your questions? Is there anything you are still looking for?
 
Please let me know. I am here if you need anything.

World Car Hyundai
mobile:XXX-XXX-XXXX
Sales Manager""


I responded with all of the issues I stated above, expecting to get resolution for my problems. I did not hear back from him that day so sent a 2nd email asking if he really wanted to know about my experience - he responded he truly did so I resent my original message. I still did not hear back from him so I called him Wednesday morning to inquire as to what he was going to do and he said he would call back. He did call a few hours later and said he had a Manual for me but could not get me a 2nd set of keys. He stated it was not unusual for a used car not to have a second key for the vehicle and my only resolution would be to buy it.

At this point, I was beside myself because this was NOT my issue. The fact that they did not get the 2nd key from the original owner was and should not be my problem and they should replace it at no cost. I went on to explain that had this been brought up during the negotiation of the sale, I would have either asked them to drop the price to the amount i would have to buy the 2nd set for or I would not have signed the ""As Is"" paperwork. In other words, I was never given a chance to know that this 2nd key was missing so how could I have been able to negotiate properly. I feel as if I have been misled by not having this conversation. Not to mention that when I buy that 2nd set of keys, I am paying MSRP whereas they could most likely get it at cost which would be significantly less.

Earlier today (Friday) I went to the dealership to get the book but the one they had for me was for a Rogue Sport. I told them I had a Rogue and not a Sport that same manager came out and said it was the same book and that depending on when it 2017 it was, they had gone to an ""online version of the Owners Manual"". I told him I wanted the correct one and we once again went down the replacement key path. After he tried to explain again about the key and I restated my point, I went to the Nissan dealership in an effort to get an Owners Manual myself and to ask if it was true about the ""online version"". It was not true so now he had lied in an effort to get me ""resolved"". I then took up the issue of the key. Long story short, the local Nissan sales rep tried to help, going back and forth with his management and finally informed me the GM from the Hyundai shop was coming over to discuss this with me. Who did it turn out to be? The same Sales Manager. We went thru everything again and he finally said ""I will get you a replacement manual but I WILL NOT get you a second key"" - just as adamant as it is written.

This dealership is only concerned with the immediate sale with no care of the service after the sale. Once they had my money, they were no longer interested in my situation that they had technically created. Had I known that this was going to occur, I promise you I would have walked out of the store because I would have known then that this was how they treat their customers.

I will make sure none of my friends go to this location. I will be putting this on my Facebook in a public post so everyone that reads it is aware of their lack of integrity and the desire to do the right and morally correct thing. I will also post this at my Twitter, Yelp and the stores Facebook account. This is now about the principle of how a vendor treats its customers after the sale is done.

3880,3783,24-Nov-17,"Called to World Car Hyundai North to make sure the two Santa Fes listed had the Tech Package and Jolissa went over the vehicle sticker and confirmed that both Ultimate’s 2.0T included the Tech Package. Went to the dealership and learned that Jolissa could not sell the car because she is an online coordinator and not a salesperson. But one of the managers was quick to retrieve the keys according to the VIN numbers she provided. Fred became my salesperson. We went through the paperwork and the 1st RED FLAG was when he offered the protection package (paint and leather sealing). According to Fred the paint sealer lasts 4 years, actually the best sealer on the market only lasts 1 reason why even this seal requires to reapply every year.  2nd RED FLAG, Fred offered to give me an additional $500 discount going with their financial company vs. Randolph Brooks Federal Credit Union (RBFCU) and told me that it was all the same. I then asked to show me the interest rate to compare…surprise, surprise, nice deception attempt. Fred’s offer was for a 4% vs. RBFCU’s 1.9%. He then removed the $500 discount offer. So make sure you see the details of EVERYTHING. We went to eat while they were making the “car ready” and paperwork ready. Wanted to make sure that somewhere in the warranty paperwork there was mention of the turbo engine been covered as part of the powertrain lifetime warranty and it took a while, but they were able to find the info and show us.  3rd RED FLAG, Asked about transferring my Disabled Veteran plates but was told that I had to do that myself since I was not turning in the other vehicle as trade-in. Called the Tax Office to check how to transfer the plate and was told that the dealer should have done it for me because not it was going to cost me more and it was going to be 3 transactions vs. the 1.  4th RED FLAG, Next day I was going over setting all remotes and instructions and noticed that items included in the Tech Package were missing. The dealership keeps records of all messages with customers and they know that Jolissa mentioned to me that the vehicle had the Tech Package. So Fred offered to take the vehicle back.  5th RED FLAG, The vehicle was handed over on the first day with filthy windows, protective tape still installed. The “get ready” was just removing the seat plastic covers and maybe rinsing the outside of the vehicle. Reason why there were dirty footprints on the back doors ledge where someone stepped on to reach the top of the car when drying. Didn’t pay for the extra protection so I got a lousy vehicle “get ready” job. 6th RED FLAG, Fred called me to bring the paperwork and have the DV plates issue resolved. I also mentioned and showed him the issued w/ “get ready” job. He told me that he was going to do it right since I decided to keep the car. This place CAN’T keep commitments or promises. Half an hour later Fred tells me the vehicle is ready. Fred removed the two protective tapes I showed him and that was it. Got back to work and decided to take a quick look. ALL other tapes are still installed, the dirty footprint is still in the same spot. The panoramic roof had round water marks from objects that were placed on it and not cleaned.    He did nothing to the vehicle. A week later, I keep finding items covered in plastic.  Believe I made a terrible mistake.",1,81,0,0

3886,3789,24-Jun-17,"Here is what happened to me during my purchase of a 2017 Hyundai Sonata at World Car Hyundai in San Antonio, TX. After reading this you should understand why I scored the survey as I did.  On Saturday June 10th my wife and I visited the dealership looking for a 2017 Hyundai Sonata Limited. The sales person greeted us and showed us what was available on the lot. I had gone through Truecar and this is what led me to this dealership. There weren’t a lot of choices available on the Limited model in San Antonio. We found the 2017 Hyundai Sonata Limited 2.0 Turbo and test drove it. We liked the vehicle very much and decided to go forward with the purchase. During the negotiations the dealership presented a price and ultimately we decided on a price $500 less. Everything was set. I was going to pay cash but was told I could save more money if I financed with Hyundai so I did. From the time we agree on a price to the time I actually got the vehicle took approximately 4 hours. Seemed like forever. The financing when through just fine. We scheduled an appointment to have the appearance package added to the vehicle the next week. We drove the vehicle home and thought everything was good.   Three days later I get a call from the finance guy saying I added the wrong vehicle to my insurance. The VIN on the vehicle from the ID card they have does not match what they sold me. I verified that the VIN on the ID card is indeed the vehicle they sold me. Then the finance guy realized they screwed up and did the whole deal on the wrong vehicle. He said I would need to sign all new paperwork. I agree to meet him at a Starbucks halfway between my house and the dealership and sign the correct paperwork. I met him and while I was going through the new paperwork when I can to the document with the total purchase price I noticed the price had increased by $2600. He did NOT tell me this, I’m the one that pointed it out. I said we have a problem. This is not the price we negotiated. He said he understood but the price we negotiated was on a different vehicle. I said that was not my fault. I test drove the vehicle I wanted. And in good faith negotiated the price on that vehicle. He said I would have to drive back to the dealership and speak to the sales manager.   I drove all the way back to the dealership. Spoke with the sales manager and he said the only thing they can do is reduce the price by $500. I said that was unacceptable. They should give me the price we negotiated. It was not my fault that they used pricing on a different vehicle. He accused me of wanting free money. I requested to speak with the General Manager. Gave him my story and he agree to give me $1200 off but not the full $2600 price increase. This whole time neither the Sales Manager or General Manager EVER ONCE apologized to me for what was happening. The salesman we had (Andy Bailey) did apologize but he was the only one. I was in a dilemma. On one hand I wanted to scrape the whole deal and get my trade-in back. But we had the new vehicle for 3 days and I had no idea what had happened to my trade-in. Plus we had been looking for a new vehicle for awhile and had gone to a few dealerships and was so ready for the process to be over.   All said and done, they agree to reduce the total to $1500, but not the full $2600. I agree because I just wanted it to be over. I still feel this was wrong. I believe that World Car should have stood on THEIR mistake and compensated me financially as well as ALL the time it took doing this. They were completely unprofessional (again not Andy Bailey the salesman).   So the next week I take the vehicle in for the appearance package (on a Friday). Was told I would get it back the same day. I got it late the next day and there were scratches on the driver and passenger side window tents which the service guy pointed out to me. So  we set up ANOTHER appointment. I went back the next week and got the windows redone.   All told, I have been to World Car Hyundai 5 times in two weeks. I live 20 miles away.   This is why I scored the survey as I did.

3889,3792,02-Jun-17,"If I could give ""0"" stars, I would. I learned the hard way that these criminals cannot be trusted. I received their ""Money Carlo"" promotion by mail on 05/30/2017, which stated that I had won a $5,000 prize. I called the dealership, advised them that I had no interest in purchasing a vehicle but wanted to confirm that I had, in fact, won the $5,000 prize--that I did not want to waste a trip to the dealership if I had not won the prize. The representative advised that ""yes"", I had won the prize but that she would need to schedule an appointment for me. She further advised that they would ""probably cut [me] a check"" when I present for the appointment. On 06/01/2017 I drove to World Car Nissan (I do not live close to the dealership) where I was advised that I had not, in fact, won the $5,000 prize but instead had won an opportunity to play a scratch-off game ticket. I left with only a $5 Walmart Gift Card. Furious, I called the dealership back upon returning home and requested to speak with a sales manager. I was advised by a customer service representative that a sales manager was unavailable but would call me back. I expressed my concerns about the promotion to the representative and advised him that the fine print on the promotion is highly misleading and may constitute deceptive trade practice under both federal and state law. He responded, ""I agree with you, sir. I'm on your side. It is a little bit of deception; we have to get peoples' attention."" He further added that the staff ""probably needed to be trained a little bit more, so everyone's on the same page"" and that ""several other people have called up here upset about this promotion."" I received no return call from a sales manager but instead was forced to file complaints with the Texas Attorney General's office and with the Federal Trade Commission. I am currently seeking an attorney to represent me with this claim. On 06/02/2017 I called the dealership back and requested to speak with a sales manager. Initially, I spoke to sales manager Jason, who began arguing with me when I voiced my concerns about the promotion, stated ""this call is now over"", and hung up the phone on me. I called back and was then transferred to sales manager Ralph, who also began arguing with me. I advised Ralph that I would be seeing the dealership in court. Do NOT trust these people.

484,3795,25-Feb-17,"My Fiancé and I found a great vehicle for our family. Decided to take a test drive and start our paperwork and vehicle appraisal. While waiting for the appraisal, which they said would take about 40 minutes, we decided to run an errand, our sales person was well aware of. When we came back to the dealer after about 45 minutes the minute we walked through the door they wanted to know what we still owed on our trade in. To us that was irrelevant because we already had our finance preapproved through our own lender. That's when everything went south. The sales person cut off my fiancé in mid sentence and stormed off to tell one of the finance guys ""they don't want to give us the numbers"". My fiancé then walked right up to the sales person and told her it was very unprofessional what she had done and said she was no longer going to help us and to get someone else that will. Once that sales person came over, they were and continued to be honest and nice through the rest of the experience. At this point, a sales manger then comes over and tell us that someone else has purchased the vehicle in cash. Didn't even drive the vehicle. As we are actively working a deal, some one else jumps in and steals the car??? Talk about quantity and not quality from a dealer! After a bit of back and forth whit this sales manager, the general manager comes out and lets me know that this is normal practice in his dealership and that's how he runs it. That it wasn't the 1st time and most likely won't be the last time. My jaw dropped. I was almost at a loss for words when I'm usually not. I explained that any dealer I've been to in the past had never sold a car our from under us like that. Guess there's always a 1st.

So on our way home tonight, well after the dealer had already close (10:30 CST), we decided to drive by the dealer and guess what? The vehicle is still there, in the same spot, same position that we left it in after the test drive! Yea, someone paid cash and decided not to take the vehicle home that night. A possibility but that's all suspect to me.

So they pulled the classic ""bait and switch"" which, by the way, is an actionable Deceptive Trade Practice in Texas.  But whatever, no hurt feelings.  I can brush off slimy sales practices and just head somewhere else without a care in the world.

What I CANNOT abide (and the real reason for my post) is how incredibly rude Drey was toward us.  He was aggressive, patronizing, and dismissive of any questions we asked.  He spent about 5 minutes talking to us, which was mostly him lecturing us about why we were naive to think the car would actually cost anything CLOSE to the advertised price.  He lectured us about waxing, ""scotch guard"" crap, refurbishing costs, etc.  

I repeatedly asked for a statement showing the drive-away price and the charges that would go into the price but he wouldn't accommodate us.

When we said we couldn't pay what he was demanding, he stormed off without even saying goodbye.  As soon as we finished saying the price was too high, he stood up and walked off, saying ""take care"" when his back was already to us.

486,3817,19-Apr-20,"I brought me car in for warranty repair. I wasn't super happy with my car and decided to see if I could get in to something better.

Test drove a Rogue Spot and decided to see if we could make a deal. Since I was upside down and my car was in for service they weren't able to help me much on the trade. We were having trouble coming to a deal that would work and right before I left I ask if there were any other options. That is when the sales manager suggested and the sales person agreed I could do a voluntarily repossess on my current car.

I had never heard of this and they explained that it would be a default on my current loan and inform the lender I so not intend to continue payments.  Then I could just sign a new load on the new car without the trade. I asked about credit impact. They said it would be small but I would take a hit and I'd start rebuilding credit and be fine in a couple months. I had reservations but went a head. While I was waiting for the finance person I did some quick research. Turns out a voluntary repossession is only marginally better then just stopping parents on the loan. I could have been looking at a 300 point negative impact to my credit score. For the next 7 years I would have had a really hard time securing additional credit and I would probably never get a decent apr on a car loan again. Further it might have impacted my credit card spending limits. It was a very bad idea. When the finance guy came to get me I called off the deal just in the nick of time.

There is a clear training opportunity here. When I asked if there were any other options I should have been told ""I'm sorry sir I don't think we can make it work. Please keep us in mind if your financial situation changes. Thanks for coming in today and have a nice weekend"". Instead I was almost duped into a bad financial decision just so they could move a vehicle. I get its their job to sell cars, but knowing what I know now this is bad advice to be giving customers making large purchases like a car.

I hope this behavior is confined to the two sales people that I worked with and not the overall policy of the dealership. However I don't think I'll be doing business with Rockwall Nissan again.

Brightside I was able to go to another dealership on the other side of town where we were able to come to a situation that was beneficial for both me and them.

Let me start by saying how disappointed I am in Rockwall Nissan and how much I hate being lied to.  I called on Wednesday September 25, 2019 and spoke with a receptionist who connected me with the parts department.  I spoke with what I believe to be the manager of that department.  I advised him that I needed to find out how to update the navigation system on my 2015 Altima and was very unfamiliar with any of the systems since I drive a Ford F150.  This car was purchased for my daughter.  The manager said it was an easy process and for me to come by and he would update it for me at no cost.  So, on Monday September 30, 2019 I drove all the way from Forney Texas to Rockwall Nissan just to meet with this person.  Upon my arrival, “NO ONE” at the parts counter wanted to help me.  I stood there for 10+ minutes before I finally spoke up and asked one of the ladies for help and told them about my situation.  After another 10 minutes a bearded male came up to the counter and said it wasn’t him that I spoke with but the manager and he would ask him what I needed to do.  Within a few minutes the bearded male came back and said that the parts manager was not available to help and that I would need to go over to the service department.  Ok, so I was lied to by the parts manager, (evidentially he can’t help me after all or just doesn’t want to).  I then went to the service department and once again, had to stand around for another 10 minutes before a white male finally got tired of talking to another employee about the weather and current working conditions and he decided to see what I wanted, as if I were bothering him in some way.  When I informed him of why I was there, all he would tell me was that I needed to call this number and order a new SD card and would not help me any other way.
I say this to the owner(s) of Rockwall Nissan, I would start by conducting an investigation into the conduct of my employees and how they handle customer service.  This is the worst I have seen since the Bledsoe Dodge days.  If you have video and audio, please review it.  This started when I called and was told by the parts manager to come by and he would update it the map on the navigation system.  That was a lie!  You have to purchase an updated SD card from Nissan and have it shipped to your house at a cost of $149.00.  
I don’t appreciate being lied to or mislead in anyway and the employees did just that.  Let me go ahead and tell you that I will never come back to Rockwall Nissan for any reason.  You could have made a friend and customer by welcoming me when I first stepped through the door but instead, I was treated like a leper.   The employees lack training and accountable supervision.  Take a page from Christian Brothers Automotive.  Treat every customer the way you would want your mother or grandfather to be treated, “like family”, not like a leper.

I just kind of stood there till finally someone said “someone will be right with you” I had scheduled an appt yet the wait was still going to be 2.5 hours (for an oil change and tire rotation..) I also asked them to look at a few other things (which in turn would make them more money because I know they had to be fixed) and I was told they absolutely wouldn’t have time to even look at what I was talking about. I am a loyal customer to Nissan and my last three cars of which I’ve purchased has been through Nissan. If they just paid a little more attention to their customers, this place would be a gold mine. However, due to the poor customer service and the unfortunate poor reviews, I’m afraid this might be the worst dealership I’ve ever been to. Do us rockwallians a favor a bring someone over from the Grapevine location and turn this place around!!! Now THAT is some great customer service :)",1,82,0,0

After the salesman and I agreed on the deal, the Finance Dept. clerk, named Elvis, was very deceptive in his explanation of why he couldn't allow to financed our own vehicle. We bought the truck anyway and with-in 30 days re-financed it with our preferred source at 3% better. Wasted a lot of time listening to his BS.
 Have been in for 2 oil changes now, the first one one took 3-1/2 Hours, and we had scheduled ahead.
  The second oil change took 2 Hours, they allow you to see the mechanics at work, thru big glass windows, Management must never see what customers see, they are so SLOW....it is incredible that it takes so long... the Mechanics spend a lot of time talking to each other and laughing , while customers wait. Had apt for 8:00 AM to get in, I left at 10:05 AM... pretty poor..also, by the way, I was the only oil change during the entire 2 hour wait. and then   they left greasy handprints on my hood..  and there was no seat protectors laid on the seats and floor mats that most other dealers use.

I’m not sure if will buy you another Nissan product  again Or use Fenton service center again.
 There must be something wrong with the Nissan Pathfinder fan because apparently I was the fifth person that week that had that part replaced. I could see if it was a 2015 or below model but to spend over $1000 on parts and service is ridiculous. 
The final straw was not honoring my $75 coupon.

Phillip had said on the phone, that the cashier would have my paper work, so I went to the cashier's desk to pay, after waiting for 10 minutes, with no one in sight, I went back to the service desk and I was still ignored. After waiting about 25 minutes I finally got someone to say the cashier was the lady that was checking in a vehicle for a customer. I thought really, then who is maintaining the cashiers desk. Another customer came in to pick up her car from an oil change and she had to wait again for the same lady. Why would any company have the cashier, check in customers? Phillip is great but when Phillip is not there, your customer service is well below basic standards. This was the rudest service ever provided, not just to me but to all of those waiting to pay you money. To come, when you aren't that busy and wait over 30 minutes to pay and drive off is extremely poor customer service. You can see from the parking lot that Fenton is trying to sell the dealership, I have put off my next truck purchase, I am not going to by from you if I can't get good basic services.

But, I just recently got an email from the General Manager, Patrick Davalos, saying my car is in very high demand right now and they are willing to give me more than what it is worth if I trade it in on a new car which would be marked down with huge discounts.  Here is the email below:

(Email received on 26OCT18)
""My name is Patrick Davalos, and I'm the General Manager at Fenton Nissan of Rockwall.
Right now, you are sitting on a very large nest egg that’s worth thousands to us at Fenton Nissan of Rockwall. The vehicle you're driving right now is in high demand and we’re willing to pay for it. But you must act now! Every mile you drive is another dollar down the road going into someone else’s pocket. I’m going to significantly cut prices, so I’d rather pass the savings to you. Please come see us now and get the money you deserve.
Heavily discounted Monster Sized Savings offers are going on now. But for a select few, like yourself, I am offering an exclusive 4-day VIP opportunity to take advantage of those significant savings and more! Including a $1.00 Down Special to get you behind the wheel! This is a limited time offer, just enough to make my October sales goals and no more. I can’t afford to do this long, so please contact me as soon as you’re able. Just think, you could be driving a brand-new vehicle for the same payments or even less.
Because you’re a customer of ours, we will give you SPECIAL PRE-AUTHORIZED TRADE-IN TERMS that will pay you more for your current vehicle today than at any other time.
I’m doing whatever it takes to make sure our customers have a great experience, so you can reply to me directly or feel free to give me a call at the number below.
Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you soon!

I responded to his email and after 3 days never got a response, so I decided to go in and ask to see Patrick Davalos, who was conveniently in a meeting and was asked if would talk to one of the sales people who is familiar with the email I got.  Sure, why not?  

The value they offered for my trade was the $1,500 below the KBB value.  The email said they were willing to offer me more.  They were way off.  Then, the price of the car I wanted, Rogue SL, was the same as MSRP $32,500.  Of course the way they show it to you, they mark it up to $37,000 and say they have given you $4,500 in discounts and rebates.  Where is the ""Heavily discounted Monster Sized Savings offers are going on now"", I didn't see any.  

In the end, they wanted to pay me less than KBB for my car and they did not offer any ""Heavily discounted Monster Sized Savings"".  They just used the email, effectively I might add, to get me in there and try their high pressure tactics to sell me a car.  I would expect this from lessor, more in line for used car salesmen, smaller dealerships.  Not a tactic I would normally associate with the Nissan brand or this dealership. 

I have no issues with the salesman Greg Amos.  He was good to work with and the test drives were great.  I really liked the Nissan Rogue SL.  Great car to drive and really nice all around.  Was really looking forward to driving away with it that day.

Very disappointed with Fenton Nissan and will most likely never buy from them again.  More over, I will now most likely never buy another Nissan again; of which I have owned 5 Nissan vehicles in the past.",1,82,0,0

I called before I traveled to be certain that my trade would bring a fair price and that there were no hidden fees.  I was assured that if my trade was how I described it there would be no problem. The salesman was actually a good guy but the process was so awful that I found myself having to demand that the key to my trade in be returned so that I could leave. I was first informed that there would be $2000 added to the advertised price due to previously undisclosed dealer ""add-ons"". Next I was told that because I wanted to pay cash that $4000 would have to be subtracted from the Nissan discount, next I was told that even though my trade-in was exactly as I had described they nonetheless could give me only $6000 for it - I was told $7000 over the phone. At each point in this somewhat grueling negotiation I was left, like the sucker I was being taken for, to wait while ""Management discussed the deal"". Next I was told that I would have to finance the truck in order to have the advertised price plus the add-on honored. I did not want to finance and I told them so but they insisted that I provide them with a credit application - I refused. It was not until I stormed into the ""managers"" office and demanded my key back did they offer to sell the truck at the originally agreed trade-in for cash. I would have walked anyway if I had not already driven 3 hours and spent 3 more hours in a stupid negotiation. This sort of treatment is exactly why car sales has such a horrible reputation. I can say this: I will never recommend a Nissan to a single person!

As a result,  I NOW LOST A GREAT DEAL on my USED TRUCK purchased due to their incompetence and then upon arriving in person to demand answers I was told they had tried to call me MULTIPLE TIMES, PLUS LEFT MESSAGES THAT THIS INSPECTION NEEDED TO BE DONE BEFORE MY TAGS COULD EVEN BE PROCESSED!....(NOT!!!) (After confirming of course that THEY HAD BOTH CELL and HOME NUMBERS CORRECT; I can up most assuredly confirm that this was NOT the case ! Even in person they lied to my face .  After becoming very irate and emotional at the situation and talking to multiple people to which quickly found a PRIVATE sales room to put myself and my son in for THEIR privacy and THEN to be disrespected and treated like a child I was asked to CALM DOWN for MY HEALTH and to DRINK SOME WATER and after almost 4 hours of wasted time and lost MONEY spoken down to, They somehow managed to go get my inspection accomplished and needed on my used truck, go to tax office and get my new tags and then offer me a ONE time OIL CHANGE, ONE TIRE ROTATION, ONE FREE TANK OF GAS AND A REFUND IN CHECK FORM of $650.00 TO BE MAILED HOPEFULLY WITHIN THE NEXT TO WEEKS not sure when it will be received FOR MY LOSS AND TROUBLE of paying full coverage and car payments on my vehicle at home so that I can sale it but is now on hold until I can receive my pd in full title for the used truck I purchased through them which will be another wait of 2-6wks of payments of waiting for state for my title.  They did however kindly offer (while reinforcing to me that they WERE NOT LEGALLY RESPONSIBLE TO DO ANYTHING) but admitted to the errors and lies made on their part from the call logs that were pulled with steps traced to verify what I was saying was nothing but the truth so help me God (Thanks for the favor)! I would like to applaud the Used car Sales Manager Chris for his integrity for owning up to the errors made during this process and to the wonderful service manger over inspections who kindly put the new tags on my truck  for me and although the compensation made was GREATLY APPRECIATED and certainly WELL DESERVED, it WASN'T no where near ENOUGH to COVER MY LOSS and restore the trust I had for the Nissan dealership in Rockwall Texas.  
You can decide for yourselves if this is where you want to go for your next purchase but this was my FIRST experience and LAST experience with this particular Nissan dealership location .",1,82,0,0

Took 2 1/2 hours

No one checked back with me during this time

Had to go looking for my car and someone to help me 2 1/2 hours later

They got my car mixed up with another car and gave wrong keys, had me sign wrong paperwork, asked me to pay for some work on brakes that was not done on my car.  When I questioned the payment (I had asked if it would cost anything on the day I made the appointment because I wanted to be ready and,  they had said nothing) the guy next to us (that was helping another customer) started discussing why I had to pay the amount VERY RUDELY in front of his customer and more!

3956,3867,14-Aug-18," I would like to start off saying that the sales department Was professional and courteous except one point and that is the Internet final price was not the final price when I got there the price went up about $1700 because of tinted windows and things like that. I wish they would have stated included in the Internet price,but that is not my main point. After a couple of months I was due for my first free oil change and as I stood in the lobby and look through the windows as they pulled my truck in and out several times I noticed why they were doing that. There are two narrow beams of iron that they are trying to bring my truck between they had to bring my mirrors in and once they pulled my truck into this brand new facility the mechanic could not get out of my truck he had to put the Door up against the metal beam as the other mechanic try to place his hand in between. As I noticed this I walked into the mechanics bay and asked very nicely ,I’m sorry did you have to put my door up against the metal beam  to get out. He said yes but the other guys hand blocked it from getting scratched I thought that was a weird being that this is a brand new facility and I have a Nissan titan and there should be a better place and equipment to change my oil and rotate my tires. I left to have dinner with my parents but when I came back , I realized I must’ve really upset those guys that I asked if they  had put my door up against the metal beam because my seat was completely laid-back pulled back the lumbar was completely blown up my mirror was completely Messed up and had to  readjust and my radio that was on talk radio was now on rap, my medical therapy devices  that I had in my Front passenger seat with my vest, is now in the floorboard one of my clamps was outside of my truck on the ground and the sticker that they placed in the window to remind you when your next or change is supposed to be was 1000 miles over the limit  for the next oil change. Another words If I  would have gone by that sticker I would have driven 6000 miles before my oil change when I’m supposed to get an oil change every 5000.  I called and left the service manager Nick Nicholson several messages he obviously is no manager at all and doesn’t care about  customer service. I now believe they are  only after selling you a vehicle and then not really concerned with your repeat servicing on a new vehicle this is obvious by not receiving one phone call  back from Nick . I would not recommending getting a vehicle serviced year find a better dealership or a small mom and pop that will give you better customer service and actually get to know you and if you do have a problem or issue will return your phone calls .",1,82,0,0

They sent all my paperwork to Nissan auto finance bank without my permission. The finance person ELVIS told me that his manager” forced him to do that”. I was still very patient. I decided to refinance my car through my bank but still had to wait FOR Fenton Nissan in rockwall to send a check to Nissan finance bank for $3000 for a bumper to bumper coverage that I didn’t want. I had to idea it was going to take 2 months...

What ended up happening, since they were taking so long, I had a car loan at 2 different banks just because they were refusing to fix their mistake and simply do their job. I got the car on May 6th, yesterday after over 2 months of me begging them to do it, July 18 the check was finally sent which meant my car was paid of at a Nissan auto finance and they only loan I’m paying is with USAA bank. Of course, I never heard any apology for their lack of professionalism but it’s ok at least I don’t want to deal with them anymore. 

The only good experience I had was with the sales person-Justin who did a great job and I was very pleased but once I had to start dealing with the financial part all of a sudden everyone was too busy to help you out and refused to pick up their phone multiple times as soon as they took my money and I became their “customer”

3961,3872,10-Jul-18,"We went to the Fenton Nissan of Rockwall and purchased a Sentra. Our salesman, Chris was helpful and friendly but made promises he could not keep in regards to work that needed to be done on the car. We got in writing that we wanted the scratches and dents fixed, a new battery, and the windows tinted on the car. After purchasing the car we left it at the dealership for a few days so they could tint the windows and replace the battery. We were told that we would need to set an appointment with Chris to have the car serviced at the onsite body shop for the dents. So we set the appointment with him for a week later at 8:00 in the morning. When we brought the car to the body shop for the appointment they said there was no appointment for us and that they would not be able to work on it at all that day. It was not possible for us to bring the car another day since we already drove an hour to drop it off for the day. So we told them we would be leaving the car with them and they needed to get the work done. We got multiple calls throughout the day about updates on our car being ""almost done"" and that it should be done by 6 that evening. When we called before heading up to the dealership to pick up the car we talked to many different people all unable to locate our car. They kept saying, ""I don't know. We can't find it anywhere on the lot."" Once we heard that we drove up there to check out the situation ourselves thinking, ""How can you have lost a car...a car we just bought?!"" When we got to the dealership the car was parked right at the front in customer parking, exactly where we had left it that morning. AND the car had not been touched. They had not done any of the work they said they had over the phone. The strange part is they went out of their way to call us with updates of things that had not been done. Our main issue with the dealership is that they will tell you whatever you want to hear true or untrue. We also still have not received the license plates after two months of making the purchase. My husband has called 5+ times asking when the new plates will be in, seeing as though the temporary plates will expire soon. Each phone call went something like, ""Oh they will be in by saturday, tuesday, next week etc."" Now the plates are expired and we still don't have out new ones. He called again and was told the plates were just submitted today by the Title Clerk- Hilda. Meaning- it could be another 3 or 4 weeks. The receptionist we spoke to Adia Kirks was very helpful and sent us an email with temporary plates and was honest with us about the situation. We asked her why the plates were not ordered months ago when we purchased the car, she said she didn't know.

That being said, i purchased the car that i wanted, not because of anything my sales person or the dealership. The kid who accompanied during the test drive didn't even know what kind of car we were in, let alone able to answer any questions, and the test drive itself consisted of 3 turns with a maximum of 30 mph. That was disappointing but not a deal breaker. The purchase itself took an incredible amount of time, finally ending at 10:30pm on a Friday with me having to leave without the SD card for the nav system. I was told to return Wednesday, and I would receive the SD card, and a couple small repairs, as well as a full detailing, tank of gas, and someone would sit with me and show me everything the car did. Wednesday rolls around and I show up to a 30 second meet with the salesman and he asked me to wait for the repairs. I never saw him again. When the car was finished, it had not been washed nor the tank filled. I even had to ask again for the window sticker goo to be scraped off, and even when it was done it was a poor job. I was given the keys and the guys left. So now I have a nice shiny new car but i have no idea how to use all the nifty features. This probably doesn't seem like a big deal, but I was promised something and I paid for a certain service and i didn't receive it.

Unethical to say the least. The first question I had was ""do you honor the Nissan VPP price""? The answer? ""I talked to my manager and yes, we do"". Then I proceeded to tell the salesman exactly what vehicle we found and wanted on the Fenton Nissan website. I then told him the VPP price and asked him specifically if we also get the Nissan rebate, AND the dealer rebate. He said...""YES"". I also told him we had a trade in and gave him all the info, including the payoff on the car. I specifically told him the car would have to be paid off during the deal to which he replied. ""I see no problem"". So after talking to him and being reassured THREE different times in three different conversations that my price with the VPP program and the rebates, and the trade in payoff would be our deal, I was reassured and basically they begged to come up there and make the deal.

3991,3906,01-Aug-17,"The service department staff lead by Jerrett is one of the most incompetent teams I've ever experienced. I'm a Gunn dealer fan but I did buy my last vehicle from IPAC (never again). I purchased the 36000mile/3year PCP plan to ensure oil changes for my vehicle. The service department failed to honor the plan through its entirety. During the purchase of the plan, I was told that a 2nd vehicle in the family is also eligible for oil service. The service department honored that up to my most recent visit. During my most recent visit, at 2 years 11 month or 35,800 miles into the plan, I was denied service under the PCP plan. I was given a run around and shown paper work I never signed.  In fact the paperwork the service department produced said my plan only included 7 oil changes. 7 oil changes for a $600 PCP plan? That's comes out to $85 an oil change. Only a fool would sign up for that. I will also say that the paperwork never indicated service for 2nd vehicle however it was honored without any trouble for the last 2 years and 11 months or 35800 miles. 

I'll also add that during 2 of my oil change visits, the service department failed to secure the oil plug correctly which lead to a oil spill mess in my garage. IPAC had to send out a crew of 2 to clean up the mess. Needless to say, the 2nd oil spill occurred in the garage of my new home. 

In another instance, I've received my car back in anything other than a clean condition. Grease marks inside the car. IPAC offered trip to the wash tub to correct. I never took them up on it. 

Lastly, the service department damaged my glove box in my 2nd car.

4040,3959,30-Jan-17,"I posted a review on thier website and I noticed it was taken off.  I bought a 2011 Nissan Armada on 01/21/2017 and the salesman was Stetson Bailey.  The vehicle had 79259 miles on it and had mismatched tires on the front, scratches throughout, and the front end might have needed an alignment.the vehicle was being sold as is so I was very sceptical about buying it but Stetson said they would put the same tires on the front as the back had and a front end alignment would be done, it would be detailed and buffed to remove most minor scratches and he would fill the tank up.  I agreed to this so he said the tires would have to be ordered and to bring it back when the tires came in so as to do what was agreed upon.  He notified me Tuesday evening to let me know the tires were in.  On Wednesday I took the vehicle in to the service department at 8 am sharp.  Stetson told me that it would take two days to do what was agreed on.  I thought that was a long time but he said there was a lot to do.  I left it there later that day at approximately 530 pm I called to check on my vehicle, no one knew anything about my vehicle.  I decided to drive there to see what was going on and as I approached the parking lot I saw my vehicle parked in the front.  I was inspecting my vehicle when he came out and asked what I was doing I told him what happened on the phone he got very defensive and said he had told me it would take two days.  I did noticed that the two front tires had been installed and I asked if that was all they had done all day.  Then I noticed two new scratches and when I was trying to show him he said ""Oh here we go"" and turn his back on me and left.  He then came back out and said it would be ready the next day early afternoon.  The next day I called him at 130 pm and he immediately became defensive by saying he had said it would be ready between 5 and 6 pm more six then five.  He then said that he didn't understand why I was belly aching so much.  That upset me very much and told him that I paid a total of 22000 dollars and that I should be driving it instead of him keeping it two days.  He hung up on me while I was talking.  I then called to speak with a manager but was hung up on me while waiting.  Stetson called me back and told me why I was the way I was because everyone loves him.  I told him I just wanted my vehicle.  He said fine and he would have it ready when he said.  I asked him if he could send someone to get me and he said no.  I had to wait for my wife to get home from work to take me there.  When we got there he wasn't there so we had to wait for him.  After awhile I saw him driving up in my vehicle and we went out to look at it.  I noticed water was dripping off the vehicle.  I had to go inside the dealer to talk to him because he just left my wife and me by the vehicle.  I told him to tell me the truth and I wouldn't be upset, I asked him if all he did was take it through the car wash.  He became defensive again and kept saying that 
The tires had been changed.  Which I acknowledged but what I was asking was that it had not been detailed and buffed.  He was so rude that I finally said I had enough and wanted to talk to a manager.  When a manager came out he asked what the problem was and I began to explain but he just wanted to know if I had bought a new car and I told him no it was a 2011 and he kept asking me what year then he wanted to know how many miles it had at that time I asked him what that had to do with what my complaint was and he said because it's an old car and it would have scratches on it.  I then asked him if he was a manager because I had never been treated like he was treating me and he said he was Mcgavok himself.  My wife said to me let's just go at which time we did as we drove off we both looked back and saw them laughing at us.  Today is Monday and I repaired a chip on the windshield, which he said he would get fixed, I washed it detailed it and buffed out most of the scratches which took me 3 and half hours to do.  Instead of them doing what they said they would they instead chose to disrespect a 20 year veteran and not do what they agreed on.

4069,3989,29-Mar-18,"I was scammed from the beginning concerning the price and once that was satisfied turns out the vehicle I purchased has many issues. As a single mom without much money, Ed Hicks was recommended to me. I was lead to believe they would work with me on the price since I wanted to pay cash but when I arrived I was told that was just to get me there. The price was almost $3K over KBB price but got the sales manager to offer a 4 year electrical and engine warranty. After having the car for 2 days it was discovered the trunk would not open and the driver side blinker was not working. After a bunch of back and forth, the service department fixed the trunk and blinker. Unfortunately, the blinker is still not functioning properly now. Then a few days later I found out the solinoids were misfiring. Yes I understand this can happen at anytime however as someone who has not had the vehicle for even 1 month I felt as though it is good business to sell people working vehicles. I was told they would replace one of the solenoids but that was going to be the extent of their kindness. That replacement worked for a moment. Maybe it's just me but I chose Ed Hicks because I did not want to get screwed over. Just my luck thats exactly what has happened. Now I have to replace 3 more solenoids, get the blinker fixed that was already supposed to be done, and the shocks need to be replaced so far. To top it off one of the local competitors expressed to me that as a customer who incurred these issues within 30 days of purchase my car would have been taken care of with no additional costs to me.

4070,3990,01-Nov-17,"I bought a Toyota 4runner from them living in a different state. It was a pretty straightforward transaction. I told them to list any defects with the vehicle and they only told me there was minor damage to the rear bumper. So I get the paperwork, and they tacked on extra fees and taxes above the service price. I had to argue with them about that. We got the price lowered, and I paid them my deposit and had my bank send them a check. They were very insistent on knowing the details of the financing, so I told them I would be financing a large portion and coming out of pocket for the remaining. They received the check and started berating me for the money I was coming out of pocket (keep in mind, it was already included in the check.) So they were trying to scam me out of another $1700. I needed to arrange shipping, and figured it would not hurt to have them send me a quote. That came in $300 higher than I was able to get online (THANK YOU uSHIP).  I get the vehicle and it has a mysterious dented door and the interior lights don't work. Additionally, the gas light is on (completely out of gas) and there is no temp tag as they promised. As I had the vehicle delivered to a parking lot, I had to drive it home with no paperwork and HOPE for the best. I complained to them and Leo Garza PROMISED he would make things right for me. He mailed me a gas card ($20 or half a tank) and got me the paperwork. They lose my title information and accidentally mailed it to my bank. I go to the DMV in an attempt to get a temp tag or register it (hour drive, so much for the $20 gift card) and they told me Ed Hicks did not bother filling out the back of the title. I drove back home, again, with no tags. I get the temp tags and start talking to them about the non-working interior lights and dented door. They threw up their hands and said it all had to happen on the back of MY delivery vehicle. The lights HAD to work when it left because they would NEVER sell a vehicle like that. Oh, and the photos of the vehicle before it left did not definitively show the damaged door. So I go digging around. I check the fuses, crawl under the dash and look for loose wires, etc. Nothing. Certainly, it isn't a bulb, right? Yup. Every single interior bulb is missing. I'm sure it fell out on the back of the truck. At this point, they've stopped talking to me. ",1,85,0,0

I must say that I went into my first Porshe purchase expecting to have a superb customer service experience, but from there it went downhill fast.  First a rat got into the engine compartment and bit through a wire and it was giving me weird warning lights.  When I took it in they said it would cost $1,800 to replace the harness as it was not covered by warranty.  I asked them to send me a picture and quickly could see that it was just one wire, which I asked them to repair, not replace the whole harness.  They would not do it, so I told them to do nothing and took it home and fixed it myself in less than 10 minutes for nothing.  The wire that was chewed in two had been stuffed far back up into the bundle of 50 or so wires, so it was hidden from view, which I did not appreciate.  I complained to the service dept, the customer service dept, and ultimately wrote a letter to the Manager of the dealership explaining my frustrations and offering to come meet and discuss it.  Never heard a word from him.  Next, I had a glancing collision with the corner of a curb near George Bush which blew out 2 tires.  Thank God I bought the $1,800 tire protection package.  Oooopps!  Does not cover hitting a curb.  So I complained and requested to cancel the policy and get a refund.  They agreed, but now 8 weeks later, I don't have the refund and Suzanne, the woman who sold me the policy (from Auto Nation) has not responded to my last e-mail, sent a month ago.  I am due for my 20K service and checked to see what is included and what it costs.  Not much and $1,100.

Based on all assurances that all systems fully functional and operational - and service records from recent 30,000 mile service and 125 point Autonation warranty inspection - I bought the car sight unseen and had shipped to NC. AND paid their list price. The car arrived with inoperative rear spoiler - and dash warning light had been turned off. After many emails, phone calls etc to Arron in service, Chris Moore (salesman) and Mike Marsh, General Manager I was told to go away.

I live 70 miles from Lithia so I took it to the Dodge house near me.  First off, the car did not have the lug key.  In order to check the tire, they had to take the tire off.  Not possible without the key.  So I called Lithia and told them my problem.  I spoke to one of the 2 salesmen (Tyler) who had made my sale.  I was told the car sold ""as is"" and he was very sorry, but could not help.  So I paid the dealer near me $65 to break off the lugs.  They discovered that the tire had been patched and air was leaking around the patch, and that I would need a new tire.... to the tune of $270.  I called Lithia and spoke to a manager (Michael) and explained my problem.  He too said, the car sold ""as is"" and ""sorry"" they could not help me.  My total bill was $437.45.  Lithia ""certified"" the car before I drove it off the lot.  Doesn't that mean they checked it out?  Doesn't it mean they should have at least noticed that I did not have a lug key?  I even think they should have discovered that the tire could not hold air.  The car I bought was a 2018 Dodge Charger with 19,900 miles on it.  I am very UN happy with customer service.  They wanted me happy before I signed the papers, but they don't really care about me now that the deal is done.  Besides this:  They got me in the door because they promised that they had located the very car I was searching for online.

I have always received GREAT service until the last year or so. Getting my oil changed has become a pain and no one every returns a phone call.

Well, on May 16 I was driving and my van wouldn't accelerate at a green light but the engine was reeving - figured something was wrong with my transmission. Got the van to a parking lot on the A&M campus and call Chrysler's Roadside assistance. They sent a tow truck. While I was waiting received a rude call from the service advisor because he had to open a ticket since he was notified my from Chrysler my van was coming.  That was at around 1pm. At around 2pm the tow truck came for the van.

I waited most of the day on Thursday, May 17 to hear that they had my van and what was up. At 3pm I caved and called. I was told they would have my service advisor call me.

Friday, May 17, I called at 10am to find out if they had my van and again was told that they would ask my service advisor to call me . I called back at 3:30 because I needed to know if my van actually got to the service center or not.

I was going to take them up on their offer to let me take it for a few hours to let my daughter drive it. The more I thought about it the more irritated  I became so I left. I then get original salesman texting me telling me they'd take $8600 even though they weren't making anything on it. So what happened to ""that's the lowest they would take"". He tells me GM was upset that salesman ""let me leave"" so they were offering me this low price just to keep my business. This is the reason I don't like buying used cars from a dealership. I told salesman I wanted their price upfront and I didn't want all the back and forth games. I guess he didn't hear that. If they  would have called and said ""$8,000 out the door"" I'd probably be driving it today. ",1,87,0,0

4133,4059,03-Dec-18,"My brothers dodge caravan was towed in on October 28th because it had no power. Our service consultant was Charles. Communication between Charles and us was about as minimal as you can get. Unless we called him we could never get any information. The vehicle is a 2017 Dodge Caravan with a full bumper to bumper extended warranty mind you. On November 13th we were told that the warranty would not cover anything on the vehicle and we would need to pay the entire $5000+ service bill before we could take the van. When asked how this could be Charles told us ""because your warranty refused to cover the repairs"". I contacted the warranty company to inquire why this was. So on or about the 8th of November they (the warranty company) sent out an inspector who took pictures of everything but couldn't approve the needed repairs because the mileage couldn't be validated. They needed the van to power up to verify that we were within the mileage to approve.  So IPAC did the repair and the warranty company sent out a 2nd inspector to approve the completed repairs. When the 2nd inspector got there and he inspected the vehicle he could tell that the repairs that IPAC said they did, they didn't do. So they refused the repairs and that's when they tried to get us to pay for them. After almost another 2 weeks back and forth with IPAC and the warranty company come to find out IPAC never did the repairs they were trying to charge us and warranty company for. They told us that the service tech had lied to all of us about completed repairs. Today is December 3rd. we have been without a vehicle for over a month because they were dishonest.

If you want your vehicle to be well serviced and taken care of DO NOT take it to IPAC, in fact I would recommend you not buy any of their warranties to prevent their horrible service. The other day my cars engine randomly seized. I took it to the manufacturers dealership to get a full diagnostic and they found that our vehicle was 2 quarts OVER the recommended amount which they concluded caused the engine to fail. They could not find anything else wrong with the car besides that. We checked oil change records and IPAC had been adding way more then required for the last 2 or 3 oil changes. I've heard that their service department DOES NOT care for vehicles properly but gave them the benefit of the doubt... When you take your car in for service you expect the service to be made exactly what is required, nothing more nothing less and it's obvious that doesn't happen at IPAC. To make matters worse when we confronted them about the issue they told us that they MIGHT be able to cover a measly 20% of the damages but before that they had to escalate the situation to management. Two weeks pass by and I'm told employee that IPAC will not help with the repairs after all and that it was my fault because I should have checked to see that the service was properly done. I was also told that if I knew the car didn't require that much oil then I should have made a special request to get the correct oil amount and oil filter on my vehicle...I was never given the opportunity to speak to a customer relations person or a manager.

When I called it was my understanding it was under the manufacturer's warranty but was told they wouldn't work on it right away so I decided to bring it after the holidays. When I dropped off the vehicle it was suddenly over the manufacturers warranty and they made me pay out of pocket. Then when I picked up the vehicle I noticed a huge scratch on the door. I told the worker that scratch was not there and took a picture of it right in front of him. He tried to say it wasn't a scratch but if it was I could call and bring it back. Well I called and they told me to send an email to chernandez@ipacchrysler.com. Never got a single response. Called back again and was told to send an email to the head of the service department jwilde@ipacchrysler.com. After serval more emails still no response. I just want the scratch fixed.

Looks like I am just reiterating what everyone else has experienced at this dealership but here we go.
After inquiring (via ramtrucks.com) I was called by the dealership (Judy) and setup an appointment.  I drove an hour to make my appointment on time and on schedule showing the respect for their time that I expect to be shown for mine.  I was introduced to Judy (gatekeeper) and was quickly assigned to one of the hoard of salesmen that stared lustily at any potential victim who drove into the parking lot.  It was strikingly reminiscent of a combination of ""The Walking Dead"" and picking up day laborers in the HomeDepot parking lot.

I was then informed that the particular unit I had inquired about, being the only unit that met MOST of my requirements and all of my preferences, was unavailable as they were lifting it and putting oversized tires on it.  Since I am simple man who has come to terms with my stature, hairline, and masculinity I had no need of a lifted truck.  

I was at this point very incensed asked why I had been invited to drive an hour for no particular purpose.  The salesman assured me they had lots of units that would meet my needs even though he had no clue what those were.  He invited me to get into his vehicle and wander through their remote lot looking at random trucks.  I then recommended we complete a computer search of their stock with my particular requirements.  He was a confused by my idea of using tools to expedite the process and insisted we go wandering about in hopes of stumbling across something that might interest me.

My Chrysler 300 2019 It’s only six months old so to my surprise the visit Indicated that my Calais converter was going out on my brand new car. I could not receive an appointment that day so they scheduled me forService when my parts came in. So November 1st parts come in and i take it back up there they do the work and i pick the car up. Get home the light comes back on. I call they say they don’t do service on the weekends and I’ll have to bring it back Monday. I bring it back on Monday and they informed me that they ordered and changed the wrong part and that they would have to order the correct part and try again and keep in mind i told them i was due at work in Pennsylvania on November 3rd. They informed me that the parts are going to take couple days to come in and that there’s nothing that they can do and I just have to be patient. Needless to say i lost my job position. Today is November 8th and i finally finish. On top of that the only way you find out any information about your Vehicle is the call because nobody calls nobody relays messages you have to keep calling calling calling calling so you can speak to someone because the service department does not call back and does not update you on your vehicle at all.

I was informed by Johnathan that the tire could not be repaired and that I needed to buy a brand new tire that cost $170. I refused and asked for them to put the tire back on. I picked up my car with out any issues, so I thought. Fast forward to Wednesday 6/3, my tire started to lose pressure again and I took it to a tire shop. When they asked me for the key to the rims, I went in the glove compartment where the mechanic left it and there was no key in the container. I went to the dealership immediately and was told by Jonathan that I needed to come back Thursday morning so that the Manager can order new parts. I arrived this morning at 0830. About 20 minutes later. Johnathan gave me a new set and said that they match the ones I have on my car even after I asked him was he sure. I left and went straight to the tire shop and waited 2 hours for them to tell me the key didn’t match. I went back to the dealership very upset and crying hysterically when I was told I needed to leave my car and it would be a few hours. The only person that came to calm me down was a sales rep that actually sold me my car, Jaron. I received the rental at 1230 and I didn’t get my car back until 1630. I asked to speak with the manager and when I spoke with him he just looked at me as if I was speaking a different language. I expressed to him everything that happened and that this was the worse customer service I have ever experienced. He just nodded his head and said ok without an apology.

Then immediately called again to cancel my pickup. Leak sprung again. Redo. Days later, called to pickup. I picked up my truck, leak sprung a few days later, while I was away for work. Brought it back as soon as I could. Again, leak diagnosed and took about a week to fix. I picked it up and the leak sprung again the next day. I hesitated to bring it back but my advisor Gary convinced me to. Gary was very professional and much help before, so I agreed. This time, he brought in a specialist to diagnose it. They found the real leak. I supposed it was in a harder-to-reach area than the tech would’ve liked to check. Due to it being in that area, I was told it would at least take ten days. Things had to be taken out and whatnot. When I finally picked it up, I checked the summary and inspected my truck as I always do. Things usually line up. This time they did not. The summary stated a 13 mile road test had been done. But 80 miles were put on the odometer, half a tank of fuel had been burned, and the took of my black truck had white paint rubbed on top. Only caused by running through a clearance that is too low. Joyride or whatever you wanna call it. I went back inside before driving at all and confronted the service advisor staff, including the manager at the last desk. They agreed that i was right about what it looked like. Unfortunately, they shrugged it off as an “oh well, xxxx happens” moment. Said nothing could be done for me since neither Gary, the diesel tech, nor the reimbursement guy were there. And that I could go back the next day if I wanted to be reimbursed for the fuel. I told them that I didn’t care about the $30 fuel reimbursement and that I wondered if that there were anything that could be done to convince me to keep my service here, if they cared about it. Once again I was met with blank stares. I’ve got a 2017 Cummins and a 2014 Charger and I would buy all my parts here and get any service I couldn’t do myself here. Now i’ll Go out of my way to river oaks or Dickinson. Wherever I can find decent service without my truck being someone’s toy. I would’ve given 0 stars, but Gary was very helpful. Called at every step of the process and left a detailed message if I didn’t answer. ",1,89,0,0

4267,4203,08-May-19,I purchased a challenger I thought was the Hemi alll along that Stressfully asked over and over its the hemi its the hemi and they said yes. That’s one. Then I just a few days ago I went to get my tires checked because the tires in the back rammed out from the inner part of the tires and all they did was rotated only. Now my car goes side ways and unbalanced. ,1,89,0,0
4268,4204,30-Apr-19,So I got a service with tire rotation done. A day later my tire sensor went out so I called to schedule an appointment.  I went in a week later on a scheduled day. They wanted me to leave my vehicle just to troubleshoot the sensor as if anyone has the luxury of just leaving a vehicle.  After an hour and a half of walking around outside i went in and tried to get an update from Steve. That arrogant jerk ignored me and acted as if i was not in front of him taking a call just pushing me off. But as soon as a young woman walked in the door he was quick to hang up and try to bend over backwards for her. So i asked that someone else help. Got the update from Luis. He came back and said the tech cleared the code and drove my truck 3 miles to see if the sensor would reset. I was worried because I have the progressive snapshot plugged in so I checked it. The logged report said the vehicle was on for about 2 minutes and that was when they moved it to the back. I asked how did they drive it if it was only on 2 minutes and I was outside the whole time never saw the truck leave. They could not answer. They said they fixed the sensor and let me go. A day later the fault code came back on and now they wont return my call so I can schedule another service. I will not recommend gulfgate dodge for any service other than a basic oil change. And not even for that. ,1,89,0,0

4273,4210,26-Mar-19,"I purchased my previous vehicle (2015 Chrysler 200) from her in 2015 and my salesperson at that time was Tyrone (he is so awesome).  I knew I was in need of another car (high mileage) and Juana called me about a special deal that was going on at the dealership so I decided to go in.

Juana was very patient, kind, empathic, and was listened to my every need.  I advised her of my budget and she worked hard at trying to get me the deal that I wanted; however she wasn’t successful.  She asked if I could meet with one of her managers about making a deal for me that I would be willing to compromise with and I agreed.

One of the managers, Alexis, approached me and advised me of two options that I had.  After I explained to him that neither option would work, he offered some unethical suggestions (i.e. stop paying on my current vehicle and just make payments on the new car) for me to consider so that he could make the deal.  He also stated that it really wouldn’t matter if I stop making payments on my car because my credit wasn’t the best (my credit is fair).  When I refused to follow suite, he returned back to his office to see if there were other options for me to consider.  At this point, I was irritated, frustrated, and overall disrespected at the horrible customer service I received from someone who is a manager.  I asked Juana for my keys and my id because I was ready to go and she obliged my request.

She walked me to my car and I advised Juana that it wasn’t her that I had an issue with, it was Alexis and the way he treated me (I did use a few choice words about my feelings and experience with the manager).  I explained to her that I didn’t like how he spoke to me, how he approached me with the deal, and how he attempted to belittle me about the decision that I was making towards the deal.  I told her that I did have a positive outlook on this place; however it has changed with me working with him.  She acknowledged my feelings and respected my decision.

Once I was getting ready to leave, another sales person approved me, Armando, who overheard some of the conversation that I had with Juana.  I explained to him the interaction that I had with Alexis and how I refused to be treated like that from someone who wants my business and that it was best for me to leave.  He acknowledged my feelings as well and provided his professional opinion about the deal. 

After leaving the dealership and evaluating my decision, I contacted Juana and was able to make a compromise (where I didn’t have to deal with Alexis) regarding the sale of the vehicle.  I was able to make my purchase and not interact with that manager in the process.  I was able to leave the dealership with what I wanted, which worked out at the end.

If it wasn’t for Tyrone, Juana, Armando, and Ms. Denise (in finance), I wouldn’t recommend this dealership nor would I have purchased my car from here again.  My suggestion would be to offer Alexis to attend customer service training, respect customers’ decisions, morals, and ethical beliefs, don’t approach deals with unethical recommendations, and be cognitive of the words that are being used when he is communicating with customers.

4283,4220,04-Feb-19,"My friend and I went in to Gulfgate a few weeks ago to look at a preowned vehicle. I had called ahead to tell them what we saw online and to have the vehicle ready for us to look at and they gave us the name of a salesman to speak with when we arrived. We arrived at the dealership and the salesman was busy so we were then told to speak with Anwar, who never actually introduced himself as I had to ask for his name after we left. We looked at the car and automatically didn’t like it because it was a smokers vehicle and then looked at another and test drove it. As we got into the car to test drive, the manager saw us in the vehicle with the salesman and said, “This looks like a crime waiting to happen. A white man, a black man, and two asian girls.” I could not believe that racist remark came out of the manager’s mouth but we just ignored it at the time.  The vehicle we test drove was an Infiniti and the salesman knew nothing about the vehicle but the obvious features. We brought up seat warmers and he didn’t even know if the car had them and brushed it off like nothing. We got back from the test drive and talked about the car and ultimately decided it was not the perfect car so we weren’t going to try and buy the vehicle and when we said we didn’t like something about the car, the salesman was very rude with his responses. I did not like the fact that the vehicle was a rental and had many drivers in and out of the vehicle and the salesman gave us strong attitude when I said that and said, “Well what are you expecting with a used car?” Then the disrespectful salesman thanked us for wasting his time and then asked if we would talk to his manager so he “wouldn’t get in trouble”. We went and talked to the racist manager who was slightly nicer, although he questioned our opinions on the vehicle and that was very disrespectful and uncouth as that just made the situation worse. When we specifically told the manager we wanted seat warmers, he said, “Really? Seat warmers in Texas?” Ironically is was 40 degrees that morning. So then we left and went on our two hour journey home as we came from out of town. The next day my friend realized she couldn’t find her license and wondered if the salesman had given it back we he made a copy for the test drive. Well I call and turns out he left the license in the copy machine so we asked if they would mail it back as we live two hours out of town. They said they would and almost two weeks later she still hadn’t received her license. So I call again a week later after them not answering the phone once and they said they still have the license and will send it out soon. Well she finally got it one and a half weeks later after that phone call with no sort of explanation or apology.

After I told him I was not going to pay more than the advertised price, he got his manager.  His manager confirmed that he would not sell the car for less than the elevated warranty price.

After the director's departure, I continued discussions with Jaron, I expressed my displeasure of the bait and switch tactic.  Jaron began to tell me I was a bad consumer because if I didn't pay the elevated price I was preventing him from supporting his daughter.  This was the absolute worst sales tactic I have ever seen.

She confirmed , yes the vehcile is available but as the Dealership is Closed on Saturdays , I can only look at the car the next day Sunday. She asked me what time I intend to come. I said around 11.30am on 30 Sep. She said ""Joe"" would be my Contact person. On Sunday the dealership called around 11.30 to check if I am going to visit or not. I said Sorry I am late but I would be there around 12.30-12.45pm. She confirmed sounds good , and my contact person now would be ""Xavian"". I reach the dealership and searched for Xavian where he said he is busy with a Customer and someone else would assist me. I waited for around 10 mins and was greeted by an extremely fine person Mr.Raul. I had to explain and give the stock number specifically which I have come for. He was unable to find the stock and said in that case the car might be in workshop. I was a bit surprised a car which was in Stock for Sale for 43 days is in workshop. I requested him to verify. After 10 mins he came back with a ""Sorry message that the car is Sold the previous day."" I was amazed. I said but your dealership is Closed on Saturdays. Then he said the Sales Person sold the car on Friday and did the Delivery on Saturday. I was Extremely Disappointed with the False Information and sheer headache of travelling 20miles to hear this crap. I said can I meet the Manager. I went with him and the Manager said he will come in sometime. I waited more than 15 mins. Then another person Jimmy informed the Manager again. After 10 mins I was asked to go to his desk. There the fun starts. I told him the list of events and I was shocked to hear his response. Here I quote George Nabbout "" We do not update the inventory so frequently in the Website/Internet. Moreover these inventory may may not be there but once the Customer is here then we try to sell whatever inventory we have. These Internet Inventory & Pricing is to Attract Customers"". I asked why dont you put ""Pending Sale"" , he said since our inventory is too low it does not make to update every minute by minute Inventory status . For him it meant its fine to give incorrect information to Customers as they are to attract Customers. I was Super Upset. I was thinking what crap dealership , what is the difference between roadside Dealerships and these big branded ones. Then I thought to come back to get his name for Review. When I came , obviously I was frustrated , I said "" Your names please"" , he said ""george"" , can you please give me the full name. Then he gave me his Business Card. Then I was leaving & he called ""excuse me"" and said in extremely rude manner "" why are you giving me such a ""f*** o**"" look & some more derogatory words"" I said back. I don't think I ever said those words nor my action prompted those behavior, I requested you to speak outside so that there is no scene amongst your customers & subordinates just in case you are a Manager."" His words"" I have nothing to hide , I have 4 College Degress, and from your appearance it seems you are also educated college degrees & .....( that I have means & resources). I dont know how many years you are in this country but I am here for 30 years & lot of jibber jabber.."" . I said again ""I have not done anything derogatory nor shouted nor raised my voice unlike you are ,  yes I am very upset and angry and I feel cheated because of wrong information which for you was super casual as it is your part of normal business cycle"". Then he said ""Yes that specific deal was a steal , i know $13000, 11k miles Altima , anybody will grab for it. I dont think you will die if you dont get that car today. I am sure this probably is going to be 2nd or 3rd car just because its a steal deal. If you want I can call you once we have such cars and miles & you can come."" I actually was super upset with his way of behaviour , I left my name and number. But inside I was sure never to visit this dealership ever.  And the best part , all time he was sitting in his chair , there was not even a chair for the Customer . Hence I was standing & he was blabbering sitting. Being in a Customer Service industry I really feel pity for him. He is really lucky to have a very good Manager else by now I would have fired him , a very can be very good at his target n numbers but a person with wrong attitude can spoil the name & create a bad atmosphere for other team members & the organization Goals.. I feel extremely sad for this Organization & Leaders .. My advice , DO NOT visit the dealership directly if you have some stock seen over the internet. Speak with a Sales Person & verify if the stock # & price is there. I saw some Google Reviews where few have complained that , they even has bumped up the price & did not honor website pricing. There seems to be an integrity issue with this dealership , hence visit at your own risk & luck. This happened specific to ""Pre Owned Car"" Division.",1,89,0,0

Sales manager didn’t even seem to care I had the messages either. It wasn’t because I didn’t apply for all rebates. I had went in a few days before got a price with all rebates I qualified for and I asked for a little extra off that price. Will be calling the General Manager about this experience.

4308,4247,19-Sep-18,"In late May, another dealership (Bayway Dodge) replaced a computer part. They told me they replaced the TIPM. They actually replaced the PCM, but more on that later. Immediately after the repair, my car started acting horribly. After a bad experience at Bayway, I took my car to Gulfgate.

I let them know that Bayway replaced a computer part, and the part was most likely bad because the problem started happening immediately after the part was replaced. Instead of immediately checking the service history on my car to verify what I told them, they took 2 months to verify. They saw that the PCM was replaced, not the TIPM. This is a fact that could have been cleared up on Day 1 with proper communication. 
My car spent over 2 months at the dealership. When I would call, they would promise to give me a call back in 30 minutes, that afternoon, etc. Often it would take several days or over a week to get a call back. 
The service manager Paul Garrett never apologized for their lack of communication. The repair was difficult but would have been much quicker if they communicated with me and  verified the service history on Day 1. ",1,89,0,0

do your homework before coming here. do not pay for ""accessories"" and get your own financing if possible.

Chris showed us several models and then convinced us to go inside and look at inventory and see if he could get us a good deal given it was mother's day and there was an extra $1k rebate. Found a white a 2017 Limited but they didn’t have it (although site said they had 6). Asked to price a JGC High Altitude. We submitted info to look at numbers. Sales Manager Mike Chapa came and gave us initial numbers with rates possibly less than 5%. At one point we mentioned just looking at numbers and weren’t thinking of buying...Mike immediately pushed his chair back and was about to stand up to leave when I stopped him and said we were discussing numbers. Obviously our time was not worth his. At that moment I advised them that the info on the sheet was not correct as we were interested in the white JGC and not the red JGC. Mike pulled up the correct information and notated all the rebates and said no worries its about the same so it’s fine. We had asked for a lower rate so he went back again. When he came back we again discussed rates but also advised him that we could get a better rate with our bank. He said ok and that he would re-verify rebates. He left again. At this time Chris (who has been more than awesome throughout this whole thing) comes and tells us Mike had agreed to the price and since our bank was closed they would let us sign the paper with the agreed amount, take the vehicle and then come back during the week to finalize the transaction. Chris advised that the $1k rebate for Mother’s Day had not been added and I also advised that I didn’t feel comfortable signing without the correct vehicle information being listed. He went back to have everything corrected only to have Mike come back and tell us the price was now $3k more because they realized there was a difference. My husband told him we had identified from the beginning which vehicle we were looking at and that he stated it was about the same but he stated he never said such a thing. Needless to say we walked out only to be called later by Mike, who left a voicemail, stating they would do the deal at the price we agreed but yet when we called back Chris tells us Mike told him to tell us they would do it for $4400 more.

The absolute WORST place to purchase a vehicle. The staff doesn't communicate, managers don't return calls and don't take your concerns seriously, oh and how could I forget DON'T APPRECIATE YOUR BUSINESS. 

Andrew Cordova, GM? Hm, you couldn't get the GM to answer the phone even if your life depended on it.

The Finance guy in Used Cars, Ryan? I don't know which habit it worst, lying or not returning people's calls.

Our Salesman Mike? How could I forget! He forgot us after we purchased our used vehicle. Dodging calls after making excuse after excuse. 

Christian in Used Sales? Pathetic Car Salesman who is dumbfounded at any and all questions.

My husband and I walked into that dealership with a trade in and put our application in with Ryan to drive out with a 17' Dually and a 15' Charger. Well, turns out all we got was the xxxxing run around. We were told approval for both of the vehicles THEN we were told only the charger but that he could FOR SURE get us into the SLT 2500 buuuut the next day told us that we couldn't get into it despite his promise SO he told us we could get into a car as long as it was under $35000 SO we pick a 17' Jeep for 31,9 and even with a co-signer this guy promised he could get me in it and even let me drive it off the lot. 4 days later (mind you, they never called us to update us) we call and call to get a hold of someone and when we do (Christian) he informed us that we were approved and in the single digits. GREAT RIGHT!? No. We called later on the way up there and he informed us that he was misinformed and I wasn't approved. I was pissed. After sitting in that lobby for 5 hours Thursday, which have Salesman running around cussing and not acting professional while I have my toddler with me I was ready to be done. I am waiting for a gift card currently that we were advertised and promise up until signing when everyone decided to not even return our calls, not like they did in the first place. I have been waiting for about 3 weeks now. It is advertised and promised at signing but yet no one will acknowledge our xxxxty customer service, unbeknownst to them, right? Wrong. My husband has reached out to Mr. Cordova and let me tell you that this man can't return a call if your life depended on it. 

The dealership is flawed to say the least but the real crack in the foundation comes down to the staff. 

Don't waste your time. Don't waste the trip because all you'll get is disappointment and empty promises from incompetent Salesman just making a buck.

I purchased a 2017 Chevrolet equinox  07/06/2017 and the advertised sale price online was $19,800. When I got home, I realized the sale price on the contract said $22,800 which is $3000 above the Internet price. The next day I called the dealership and let them know why was the sale price change from $19,800 to $22,800 and they stated because there was a mandatory warranty that I had to purchase. I advised them that I didn't want that warranty and they told me it was mandatory or else they weren't going to be able to honor the Internet price. I let them know that they can't force me to purchase a warranty or service contract if I don't want to and they simply stated that it was too late I already agreed and signed the contract. I know it was my fault for not verifying the numbers on the contract but this dealership operates with deceptive practices in order to increase their profits and they hide everything from you and just make you sign really quick. By law warranties are free and service contract should be charged as a separate line item on the contract instead of increasing the sale price of the vehicle.

NO SOONER did I send the financial information, I received an email “SOLD SOLD!

Was told they didn't want to take the time to do the paperwork and get me a rental car for the Recall on my car. They said can you wait till the new year and just bring it back then. 
I told him I needed it fixed but he said it would be difficult to complete in a weeks time, I'm not sure why that matters but I said that's fine I will take it to the dealership near my house.

I asked if they could even do the Oil change and replace the run light that was out?
With an attitude he passed me off to the guy who handles the Oil Change.

Later I returned to pick up my car, and I opened the hood to look over the engine and check the oil dip stick.
I noticed the clip that holds my windshield wiper fluid in place was broken!

I went back in to ask the service guy to take a look and I was told he was in a meeting and I would need to wait 15 mins. So I walked back to the office where the meeting was being held, walked in and said excuse me there is a part broken on my car and I need him to come look at it. 

The Manager said who are you I responded with I am a customer and walked back to the car.

the manager and the sales guy along with 4 other guys followed me to the car and looked it over.
The Manager started to have a big Attitude! He tried to talk down to me and I butted in and said ""Sir knock off the Attitude, Right Now!""

The Manager did not even notice I said anything.

So I waited till he was done and said ""Whats with the Attitude?""

He just looked at me. So I repeated ""why do you have an attitude?""

He said ""I am going to look this part up"" and left.

He returned 5 mins later and started raising his voice again and I said STOP having an Attitude Right Now!
He paused and said I'm sorry, it has been a crazy morning, I have ordered the part and we will fix it. 

P.S. The light they fixed / replaced was very dim and after 1 day you can't even see the light is on unless you bend down to look at it and the message popped back up and says Run Light is out.

Over the phone they told me that I didn't need an appointment to get an estimate. They never had the decency to tell me after 30 mins of me sitting there that they would not even have time to look at my car. I had to walk up and ask them the status of my car. Needless to say that I left after 2.5 hours of wasting my time and the lady said she would put it on the computer under my name that the next time I bring my car back that she could move it up to the front of the line.

4395,4343,30-Jan-19,"Last week I went in for an oil change. Asked if they could look at my alignment again because the last time they did it, I drove off and it was doing the same thing and the manager confirmed that it was still pulling to the right. (After test driving it while I was in the car.) I got my oil changed and then they said I should schedule to come in for the alignment issue. So they said they needed about 2 hrs since I had a wrangler and only have to work on the front wheels. We chose Wednesday. (He said Monday’s are busy). This morning I got there thinking it would take 2 hours I brought my computer and started working. Minutes later I was told that they didn’t want me to have to wait around and since this issue is covered under warranty they would give me a rental. I wasn’t happy with the rental (because it wasn’t a wrangler instead it was a mini Cherokee). I was then insured it would be finished by 3pm.  At 2 pm I got a phone call saying it wouldn’t be ready today. I asked what was wrong? They said they are backed up. Mind you I drive around town as part of my work duties. So then they said we should know something tomorrow by 10am. So I had to go back there to get my children’s car seats out and garage opener. i spoke with the manager when I got there to express my dissapointment that my car was not completed today as I had been told it would. His response was unacceptable (to me). He explained that they get backed up and I shouldn’t tie them to a tight time frame and I should expect to have to wait 2 days because they have 180ish cars to servive. (Mind you they told me how long it would take: 1st 2 hours, then by the end of the day). He went on to say that he had put my car in front of 25 other cars as if he was doing me a favor. Then reminded me that it had been a while since I first had had the alignment looked at. (Again as if it was my fault and I had already explained to them personal/medical reasons why it had taken so long for me to return. Not acknowledging the fact that I was told after it was worked on the first time that something wasn’t done right. When I came in last week I wasn’t expecting anything free but was told they would make it right).  I then asked him how is that good customer service. Then he blamed others for telling me a time frame. Never once apologized and accepted responsibility. I asked if I could keep my place in line and when they were working on the car in front of mines if I could bring my car back within 15 mins of the call. He went around this question by saying something that could take 2 hours might take 4. He said one of his techs stays until 6pm and May be able to look at it tonight but work wouldn’t be don’t till tomorrow. I also asked what was the purpose of scheduling an appointment if they wouldn’t even look at my car that day. He then asked why didn’t I leave my car there last week. I explained that I wasn’t given that portion and it would be better to schedule. (He has no response for that) The whole time we had this conversation he seemed irritated by the fact that I was holding them accountable. I understand things happen and at least the service provider was nice, respectable and showed empathy and was trying to find solutions for me. (I also understand that he is limited in what he can do to help me). The manager on the other hand was cold and blamed others including myself. On another note if the warranty company is paying for the rental while my car is being repaired, I’m not so sure that they would be happy to know that they paid for a loaner car, and the first day 8:30-4:30 (Probably wasn’t looked at, at all) my car wasn’t even looked at. So now I wait until tomorrow at 9:30am for them to call me and tell me what the problem is with my car. (I was also told it should be finished by 10am tomorrow). I feel like I would have been better off staying there to wait, maybe they would have at least looked at it. ",1,90,0,0

Surya said they could get it.  Well they located one really quickly but it was a demo with 2500 miles on it.  I said I didnt want a demo so we went to another truck.  Another truck came up and the dealer trade just couldnt be made but this was after Surya told me it was secured.   Then a 3rd vehicle came up.  The trade was done yet the day I was supposed to go in and sign it was told me to that this was a demo.  The salesperson took no blame for this is issue at all.  He said repeatedly it was not his fault and do not kill the messenger.  It was a comedy of errors of not setting expectations properly and not taking ownership for mistakes.

4399,4347,03-Jan-18,"Contacted several Jeep dealerships seeking a specific model of a Jeep renegade.  Was sent a email with a picture of the model I was looking for, so I called and set up an appointment.  Upon arriving I was not shown the Renegade that was shown in the email sent to me, but the sales person (Cary Murillo) listened to what I wanted and provided a similar model having the specifications I desired.  This is where things changed when it was learned that this was the Renegade I was interested in purchasing.   The process dragged out way too long taking almost 3 hours to purchase a Renegade for cash minus a trade in.  The trade in was a one owner vehicle with a clear title with no liens, had been excellently maintain by a dealership with all scheduled maintenance and was checked by that dealership just prior to this transaction.  The sales rep had to got to the manager to get the offer for the trade in and returned with a figure that was 1/3 of even a dealership trade in value.  When it was apparent that this figure was unacceptable and unrealistic to me, I was told that the manager ""didn't like the way the engine sounded""; but was also told the manager wasn't a mechanic.  The sales rep went back to the manager  and came back with an offer that was twice what was originally offered (this involved thousands of dollars).  It took less than 30 minutes to me to decide to buy the Renegade and most of the time spent waiting involved offers for the trade in.  If I had not already done my homework on the value of my trade in, I would have been out a lot of money to fatten the profit already being made upon me.  I have purchased many vehicles in my life and have faced this before as this is a well known ""car salesman"" tatic that people hate and fear.  Make extra money off the customer because they may not know what the trade-in value is and use some lame easy to back out of excuse for the first offer if the customer balks, and delay the whole process so the customer will get tired and agree to any offer just to get the whole process over with.  Good sales practice to increase profits, but has one bad side effect...You just showed the customer that you are trying to rip him off and makes the customer feel that he can't trust you to make a fair deal.  Makes the customer wonder what else in this deal are you pull and definitely brings out ""buyer beware"".  Definitely the trust is gone, and I didn't believe anything else said or excuses made to me after that.  The deal I finally agreed on still allowed the dealership to make a handsome profit on the trade-in as well as the sale, but it was what I expected. 
 I'm not against a dealership making a decent profit, but to try to rip the customer for more not only didn't get the more they wanted and lost the trust of the customer....doesn't sound like a good, long term business model to me.  Is it just in the sales department or does this tactic apply to their service department too by telling the customer he needs service that he really doesn't.  I won't find out as I will find another dealership for the service I need.  I will not purchased anything else from here and will tell all that I know to avoid this place that practices the old ""check with the manager game"".  I also hate the ""if you can't give us a 10 on reviews let us fix it"" game....you can't fix an attempt to rip the customer off.  Even if withdrawn, it still kills the trust.

I pulled into their service floor and no one came outside after 10 minutes waiting in the service floor parking lot.   I decided to go inside to check in, all the technicians are sitting on chairs with a counter to separate them from the customers.  I told one tech, it was my first car service, and right away, I was ask with Who?  I told the technician who I was assigned to, and was redirected to that technician.   The technician I was redirected to, seems to be very frazzle with the workload he had over his counter on top of three more customers in from of me while the other technicians were joking and talking.   Why no one of his peers think of helping him, I don’t know.  But it was ver frustrating to be in there for 45 minutes before he can attend to me.  When he was able to talk with me, he informed me due to the problems my vehicle was experiencing that he was going to keep the vehicle for a day or two to find the cause, so I was giving a rental.  I thought that was a good compromise.   Anyway, my vehicle was dropped off on Monday morning, Tuesday not word on the status, Wednesday afternoon around 11 in the morning I decided to call asking for the status of my vehicle.   First time I phoned, The operator informed me, my technician was busy with another customer, and he would call me back.  15 minutes later, and he did.   He apologized for not able to take my call and gave me the status of my vehicle, told me that everyone went to lunch and I couldn’t get my vehicle yet, but that he would call me around 2:30 in the afternoon to let me know if I could.   Never happened.  So, by 4:00 in the afternoon, I decided to be more proactive and call.   Again, he was busy, and he will call me back.  15 minutes later, he was apologizing for not able to answering the phone and calling me back to let me know if I could pick up my car.   At this point he informed me I could.  I was excited but disappointed with the level of inefficiency within the company.  These are some of my personal suggestions to make that place on running much better.  Firstly, When you pulled in to the station for a service, some technician should be redirecting to you where you need to go or checking you in the spot with an iPad.  Using technology is beneficial on this circumstance.  If that is not possible a sign with instructions on the check in process.  

Secondly, technicians should be able to help anyone that come by the office if there are free. 

Thirdly, have a computer system where anyone can give you a level explanation on the status of your car, it would help the technicians improve overall experience with the customers on site without interruptions.   

There is more ideas I have but for the purpose of this review.  I think I am giving my most honest answer of my experience.  ",1,91,1,0

I do not appreciate the snarliness that seems to have become quite commonplace in this service department. I am a frequent customer and have been going to this particular dealership for over 10 years. Service personnel have never been great, but the current folks need an attitude adjustment.

The lackadaisical attitudes, the 'we are doing you a favor by even acknowledging you presence’ is just appalling.  This started from the time I called them with the snobby attitude on the phone, to the minute I walked into the service department and everyone was either ‘busy’ or just staring at their computer monitors.  I have a huge right up going into detail, but it is too large to post here.  To think that they are the ‘best’ inside of 1604 of the Dodge dealerships is just amazing.  Can’t imagine what the others are like.  Thank God I purchased a extended warranty and was able to take it to Alamo Toyota where they performed the repair of a oil sending unit replacement for free, and even offered me a loaner vehicle.  Ancira, you want to learn how to treat your customers?  Hire Ronnie at Alamo Toyota and give him a raise to boot.   I can sum it up with this:  ‘Your keys are at the cashiers booth’.  That’s it.

4445,4399,20-Jul-17,"In summary: Worst car buying experience we've ever had. I've never worked so hard to give someone my money. Do not shop here. Tell your friends not to shop here. Spend your money elsewhere and safe yourself a lot of misery. 

In detail: This was a good experience until we committed to purchasing a vehicle and signing our names on paper. At that point, we were handed off from one person to another (working with a total of 5 different people!), with poor communication between the employees and multiple mistakes made. There was no disclosure of the total price, financing options, or APR until we explicitly asked for it and, even then they were not forthcoming with the information. Additionally, our initial APR offer from them was over 5% until we informed them that we would be financing through another company. At that point their APR offer quickly dropped to less than 3%. We stuck with our other financing options. 

By TX law, the dealership has to register the vehicle for you. We wanted to register the vehicle in our home state and transfer my old plates, as we're only in TX temporarily. We were told that we couldn't do that. A quick call to our home state DMV confirmed that, yes, actually we could and suddenly the problem was solved. The dealership also held onto the registration paper work for 3 WEEKS after everything was official, further delaying the registration process. They had initially told us the paper work would be mailed off the same week we received the vehicle. This is unacceptable. When I called to check the status of the registration, Michelle, the Title Clerk,  rudely interrogated me as to why we chose to register our vehicle in a state other than TX (she did not approve of our decision).... obviously mailing a stack of 10 papers instead of 5 is too much of a hassle, even for someone who has just spent over $40,000 with your company. This is an example of pathetic laziness and extremely poor customer service. 

We have continuously had to call and go back to the dealership to follow up on paperwork (I went back 3 times after we signed everything) and they always come up with an excuse as to why the job isn't finished yet. What it comes down to in the end is they only want your money and are not concerned with maintaining appropriate business integrity, honest disclosure with their customers, or good customer service relationships. I would give them 0/5 stars if I could. ",1,91,0,0

4471,4430,24-Feb-17,"This review is not about the folks in the service department - my experience, when I am actually able to get an appointment, is that they are good people and strive to provide decent service. Nor is this a review of their ""Express Lane"" service for oil changes and such - that seems to be working. Rather, I'm writing about service needs for other than ""Express Lane"" items. Note, if you don't have specifics for them for what you need looked at or serviced - you will likely end up frustrated. They simply don't have time to a provide a more consultative experience. But lately, the real problem has been in actually getting ahold of anyone to schedule a  service appointment. I left several messages for a callback to schedule my last appointment. All calls ALWAYS rolled to voicemail. Over a period of two weeks, and after several messages, I never got a call back so finally I drive down to the dealership to make an appointment in person! That seems to be the only way to get an appointment now - and they seem to be scheduling at minimum two weeks out or more now. They are clearly overwhelmed - and it's disappointing that this issue has been neglected and left to get worse and worse. At present,  I again need to take my vehicle in for a non ""Express Lane"" issue. I've given up leaving voicemails - no callback yet again.

To back up a little bit this car replaced a 2010 Tahoe that had a roof that was leaking and they were going to have to replace the roof on the car. So we got the suburban thinking that the Tahoe was just a lemon and this one would be better. Well back to the leaking car. I took the car to the dealership and was told that it was probably leaking around the windshield that had been replaced. So I made an appointment with the body shop and they tested the windshield and found no leaks. A couple of weeks later I am back at the dealership and was told that it was going to cost around $300.00 to diagnose the problem. I was called later and told it was a body seam leaking and that it was not covered. I asked if I could come take pictures ( they would not let me take pictures of the first leak ). I asked if I could come take pictures and I was told that they hadn't taken the car apart yet but when they did I could take pictures. When I got there to take pictures I was told it was leaking behind a blob of caulking that GM smears on the seams. I made the comment that any normal person could see that if the blob of caulking would have been smeared in the area of the leak it would not have leaked. I asked them how they would repair the leak and the answer was to put some more caulking in the area behind the original blob of caulking. So in other words where the other caulking should have been. Their answer was always the same, I don't know.  I have a case on this problem with GM and the service department  will not mention to them that if the caulking would have smeared in the area that was leaking  it may have never leaked. All they would mention to them was the car had been in an accident in which the body shop told me there was no damage in that area.  They also told GM that it may have been cause by the way I drive, weather conditions, or the flexing of the vehicle that cracks the body sealant causing it to separate  ( I did not see any cracks or separation ). I went back to the dealership and told them I needed documentation as to what caused it to leak and also that something stating that the door gasket and wires running along the threshold of the door had been under water because of the water leak and I was told I had all of the documentation on my invoice I was going to get. All it said was where body seam was leaking  and that it was fixed.  I was told that the corporate person was just giving me the run around.

My Subaru has many problems now. Service inept and sell me things that don't fix the problem. Almost as if they are rolling the dice at my expense. If the computer can’t give them a code they understand, problem will never be fixed. Why? Because they are not professional mechanics!
They don’t fix anything, they just replace things and hope it’s the right item. Then plug the computer and read code again. I ended up going to a real professional mechanic, it was much cheaper and they gave me a loner unlike Gilman Subaru. BTW, I immediately noticed all sort of parts were missing after Gilman worked on my car. They forgot to bolt all sorts of shrouds and things back on. The oil was changed even though I told them (Don’t change my oil please). Even a simple battery replacement and they forget to put covers or shroud back over battery terminals. Something went wrong with the oil change and engine compartment is covered in oil. My new professional mechanic cleaned it up and explained the situation to me. I basically need to sell the vehicle since it’s been permanently damaged by Gilman. Just save yourself the trouble and shop someplace else. Definitely! Don't Get Service Done Here! The children here that work on $43,000+ new cars are so incapable, you may find tires way over inflated, missing valve caps or just didn't even do the multi-point inspection at all.

We had a deal to purchase a vehicle on Monday at 5. At 4:23, we got a text saying the vehicle had been sold to someone else. After confirming the schedule at 3:40. 

We saw the vehicle just before closing on Saturday evening. I texted our salesman, Jacob Moniz, on Sunday morning to tell him we wanted to purchase the vehicle. On Monday morning, we texted back and forth about the details (the price had increased, but the manager agreed to honor Saturday’s promotional price). We set a time for us to come in and complete the paperwork. My husband left work early, so we could get there at 5.  He wanted the kids to witness the purchasing process since the car would be their first car. My daughter was over the moon. Until we got the text saying it had been sold to someone else just as we were on our way to the dealership. She was devastated. We all were. 

I saved the entire text history and planned to share it with anyone who would listen. Thank you to the manager for asking my opinion. I hope that the request was genuine and that the manager will use this information to improve their employees’ unethical practices. I have never been more disappointed in a business transaction. My guess is they got an offer to purchase the car at the increased price, so threw my family under the bus. I would have happily come in earlier to purchase the car, if necessary.

The dealership on the other hand has been a nightmare.  The car has been in for routine maintenance 4 times, the battery once, and a tire once.  Every occasion has been xxxx.  For example, after coming in on time for an appointment to have the battery replaced, that took 2-1/2 hours!  To replace a frickin' battery.  When I arrived they said 45 minutes tops, so I decided to wait on the car.  After an hour they said ""almost ready"".  That kept up for 2-1/2 hours.

On the latest occasion we took it in for routine maintenance (24K service).  We got the car back and noticed on the way home that they had not properly replaced an access panel underneath, which was dragging.  We immediately returned to the dealership to have them re-attach it.  What freakin' mechanic is so sloppy that he doesn't put everything back together?  Especially something so obvious in front of him?  It makes me wonder and worry what else might have been left half done.  Did they remember to tighten the oil drain plug, for example?  Sloppy, sloppy work--and it has been like that on every visit.  Further, I spoke to the general manager at Clear Lake Subaru about it.  He blamed the problem on ""poorly-engineered fasteners used by Subaru.""  Bull crap.  They are standard, easy-to-use fasteners found on most every car and motorcycle.  The real problem is sloppiness by his staff, but he refused to acknowledge it or bring it to their attention.  SUBARU:  You need to dump this dealership.

On another occasion we brought it in for to have a damaged tire replaced.  THEY KEPT THE CAR NEARLY TWO WEEKS TO CHANGE A TIRE!!!  They didn't stock the tire for the car they sold, so had to order it in from Minnesota or somewhere.  Then they had to ship it off again to have it shaved down to match the wear on the other tires.  THAT IS RIDICULOUS!  If you are going to sell these stupid full-time all-wheel drive vehicles (that have to have their tires shaved or all four replaced at once), then get the shaving machine in house.  Or at least one to share in Houston.

This dealership is a part of the Lithia group of dealers.  So beware the rest of them.  They may all have rejects for mechanics and managers.

4546,4508,14-Feb-19,"Bought a used car from Huffines Kia in Oct ‘17 with around 75,000 miles on it, added the “platinum plus” warranty for powertrain coverage until 100,000 miles. In and out no problems, the buying experience was actually a pleasure compared to any other vehicle we have purchased, as a matter of fact we highly recommended Huffines since that day and never planned to go anywhere else for another car purchase.   As for this car, regular maintenance was done and the car had been running fine since purchased, last check and oil change was only 4 weeks earlier. Wife was driving home Friday and car just loses all power and dies on highway and will not start up regardless of what we try. Checked oil since service was recently done and found oil still looks “clean” and within spec. We get car towed to Huffines KIA and wait all day Monday for any news as to what the issue is, finally around 5 we find out the engine has seized, they cannot provide a reason as to why this happened. We go through the process of verifying we had the extended warranty but only until 100k miles and we are a little over 103k so repairs would not be covered. Price quoted for a new engine is $30,000 or a used engine for $9,000, an engine found online is ~$1,600, these prices don’t even include labor which is another ~$1,500. The car in good running condition is only worth $3100-$4200 according to KBB so we obviously are not going to spend more than the car is worth in repairs. Our info is passed to the sales team and we are told to provide service records and the service consultant will “go to bat” for us with KIA to see if they will cover any of the repair. We don’t hold on to receipts very long so we provided what we could find/get which wasn’t much, and as expected KIA said they would not help, I suspect this would be the case either way as service is where the vast majority of their money is made. We have a 2008 Ford that has never had any issue until 2 days earlier when the transmission gave out at ~150k miles, so I guess we aren’t doing too bad when it comes to vehicle maintenance.

After our info was passed to the sales team, we scheduled a time to come in and discuss trade/purchase of a vehicle. During this discussion of the situation, our credit and available down payment, we were basically told that we should not have bought the first used vehicle to begin with (even though we bought it from Huffines), the sales person also found out we had another working car (how do you think we got there in the first place) and we were then treated as if we didn’t need to replace the car with the seized engine. The sales person also became very uninterested in selling a used car and only seemed to want to sell us a new one. We are upside down on a car that will not be repaired so we cannot roll it into a new purchase and therefore only have 2 options, eat the repair (not going to happen) or try and get approval for another vehicle when we already have 3 financed, one of which is the seized engine, so that is not likely to happen either. So since KIA won’t stand behind their product at all past 100k miles, and Huffines didn’t want anything to do with it, I suppose we are stuck with a very expensive paper weight… Needless to say Huffines and especially KIA are no longer recommended by us or anyone we know.

4560,4523,24-May-20,"It’s hard to write this review, because I have nothing against Subaru itself, but my three-day experience with Austin Subaru has been nothing but a complete disaster. Since my salesperson (Nate Lowther) refuses to acknowledge me or my situation any longer, I felt a review was the only way to let him, his boss, and the owners know the gravity of the situation that he and his financial team have now left me in.

To preface, my 2006 Toyota Corolla finally bit the dust, and I realized it was time to put her down. Spending thousands a year in repair is just not in the cards for me and I wanted to get something more reliable, obviously. To get around, I got a rental for the month because it’s cheaper than ride shares and doesn’t require severe exposure to the public/covid via public transit. A compact car rental can run ~$700/month, which is what I paid – on top of my regular car insurance of $120/month.

Nate knew my car situation. He was also fully aware of my financial situation (i.e. an “okay” credit score, on unemployment due to Covid, freelance side job, etc.). Throughout the whole process, I was made to feel that this was in the bag. The design team (Hilary R.) even came out, discussed add-ons, and congratulated me on my new car purchase when we wrapped up with her. Seriously, I was congratulated as though this was a done deal.

Nate came in immediately after (we saw him waiting for Hilary to wrap up), and he started asking if my boyfriend would co-sign, that he needed paystubs more recent than what I had provided, and that my freelance documentation wasn’t adequate. I didn’t want help from anyone at the time, and I couldn’t understand how things just took such a hard left.

My partner needed to go to work, so we left at 230p with Nate telling us he would update us as he worked to get this done. My partner even wanted to make sure this guy was taken care of if someone else helped us because Nate had come in on his day off to meet with us. That was probably the nicest part of the whole situation.

That evening, I get a text asking about my unemployment and I sent my documentation thinking this was okay. The text I receive back is, “Hey there! So your info has been submitted to the bank of choice. Of course with is being late in the day, we won’t hear back until tomorrow. So far it’s still there and waiting on you haha but I will let you know as soon as I know something.“

What ended up happening is something I can’t even make up. The next morning, when I hadn’t heard from Nate by 1130a, I texted him that I would be trying to apply through my own credit union – I even expressed that it seemed like I wasn’t going to get approved through their banks. So I asked for the requested loan amount. Nate’s reply, “Great. Let me check with the add ones (*ons) from the design girls.” He then texted, “We actually bank with [same bank], do you want us to submit to them?”

Not understanding that their paperwork was filled out in a way that would cause me to have an automatic denial, I said, “That would be great!” That was 1150a on Friday, May 22.  When I didn’t hear back from him, I started to think that I should ask for help and get a co-signer. Swallowing my pride, I asked. After much debate and weighing options, I texted Nate, “Also, if ****  can co-sign, can she do this without being present? She lives in *******” – to which Nate sent the online form and said he would ask, also said she needed to send her ID, etc. I say, “Will do! I’m about to chat with her.” – at 223p Friday. 312p Nate replies stating people are interested in the car we’re trying to buy. I respond by saying I need to discuss things with my co-signer…324p Nate texts to say again that he’s trying to hold the car from other folks trying to buy it. I explain what’s going on and ask a few more questions, and by 5p my co-signer had filled out the forms.

After a lot of back and forth Nate replies, “It looks like we found a place!” and proceeds to let us know we need to submit more proof of income. Which was done. This guy then sends a text, “So.. what we believe will be the easiest with ****not being able to show paystubs (btw, my co-signer received retirement, is an independent travel agent and works a very very part time job at an art’s center), is for her to go to her bank and apply for the loan herself and that way her personal bank has all of her info and will be able to get anything else they may need. The car is still here, so if she goes in the morning and talks to her bank about the vehicle and a loan, we believe we will be able to get it. It’s hard for banks to accept loans right now without proof of income coming in. Her bank has her deposited checks and her personal information and should be able to assist better. I still have hope!”

To which, I replied, “Are you not able to just take her retirement? I can’t ask her to go to her bank to apply. Did you say a bank statement showing a pay deposit would work?”

To which Nate replies that he asked his manager to submit the forms with just her retirement and he would do so. He also stated that with it being so late in the day (645p) we wouldn’t hear back until the morning.

To be honest, I think Nate recommended I get my co-signer to just get a loan through their bank because this is where they knew they screwed up. I can only speculate, because not one person from this place has explained anything to me honestly.

Moving on…

Next morning, at 916a I send a text asking if everything worked out and inquired if my debit card would be an acceptable form of payment for my down payment. Nate texts back at 934a, “Good morning! I sure will. And yes, you can use your debit card. I’ll let you know something soon.”

Hours pass…at 1128a I ask Nate to let me know if there are any issues, and if we needed to try another dealership we needed to do so sooner rather than later. No response…

I let my co-signer know that I hadn’t heard anything – we both become concerned at this point. While chatting, my co-signer receives a weird voicemail from a Johnny Johanny who seems to be reaching out to her as if she’s a new lead that needs to be worked. I have this voicemail and Johnny’s message is weird, to say the least. I send Nate the voicemail along with my trepidations, “My [co-signer] just received this VM – it’s very concerning to us that just anyone is accessing her info. I will be coming in around 140p.”

Again, absolutely no response…

I arrive around 2p and ask for Nate. He comes to the foyer, after I hear him and someone in the finance department mention my name, my co-signers name and something about Wells Fargo. Nate then gives me a run-around. Seriously, he started the convo by saying they still needed income verification – BUT everything was submitted. What he told me in person made absolutely no sense at all. I let him basically BS me and he ends the conversation by assuring me my loan was still being worked on.

I leave extremely confused, but I tell him that I’ll let him know if I find another car elsewhere because he couldn’t say if the bank would get back to them same day or not and we really needed to get this done. I told him this was becoming a bit tedious for me, and acknowledged it was for him as well, but he stood there and apparently lied while I tried to understand what the heck was actually going on.

Since I really wanted a Subaru, I called Georgetown Sub and decide to head that way since the two dealerships are not related. They had inventory, and at this point I’m ready to NOT give Austin Sub the business because I’m feeling really uncomfortable with the whole process.

What did I find out? After re-starting the loan process and waiting three hours, I am told that Austin Subaru basically screwed me over. How? Let me tell you…

Apparently, Austin Subaru ran my loan application through at least 11 different banks (all the major ones) with information that any auto-finance person with experience would know would result in an automatic denial. Georgetown tells me that their finance guy spoke with Wells Fargo’s loan officer and found out that Austin Sub submitted the app and should have known I was denied for at least a day. So this means when I went to Austin Sub after Nate refused to respond to my valid concerns, he knew that there was no way I would be approved.

Not only did I find out the way they filled out the forms would result in a denial BY LAW from any lender, but I was told I would not be able to get ANY financing through any other dealership for 60-90 days unless it was in-house financing outside of Subaru. Even then, there’s no guarantee when you only have one shot. I was also told that I would have been approved had Austin Sub filled out my forms with my paystubs up to Covid. Maybe not for what I applied for, but at least for something certified. Reliable and with a warranty were two of my main concerns in a new vehicle.

While my new sales rep at Georgetown was breaking the news, and sincerely apologetic, I most certainly sent a text to Nate telling him “you F***ed me.” I asked him to shred all of mine and my co-signer’s info. I told him that Georgetown was honest and upfront about everything, including what Austin Sub had done. I also brought it to Nate’s attention that I now had to wait 60-90 days to reapply for anything.

“We sure will,” was the only reply I received from this person. He didn’t take ownership, he never gave me straight answers, and he was too cowardly to let me know what was actually going on. Every step of the way, this guy left me in the dark.

I told him I would share my story and that they should be ashamed, as they should, for not having the courage to be honest. He knew all day I had ultimately been denied because they didn’t know what they were doing. Georgetown was on track to get me approved because they seem to have experienced staff who actually know what they were doing.

My last text to Nate asked for the owner’s contact info/email address, to which I did not receive a reply. I doubt I receive one.

To the owner of Austin Subaru, please make sure your salespeople are trained on how to deal with special circumstances. Please make sure no one is ever led on the way I was led on – never receiving ANY word on approval or denial is pretty messed up when you hand over such personal and sensitive information. Make sure your financial department knows how to fill out forms properly.

Above all, Nate needs some training on how to deal with giving people bad news. To just take someone’s info and then start ignoring them is so wrong on so many levels. This actually hurt me, as I was left in disbelief that this was something that could actually happen. Georgetown had to break the news to me and said that they couldn’t do anything with my application for financing because Austin Sub had already hit every bank possible.

For someone trying to make a better life for herself, it doesn’t help that these guys screwed me over from anything but Toyota or another dealer’s in-house ONLY financing. Seriously, Austin Sub made it to where I can’t even go get third party financing from another brand for 60-90 days, and they won’t even take ownership for what they did - NO apologies, NO acknowledgement. Just a “We sure will,” when I asked if they would shred my info. 

By the way, Nate had another person’s ID in my file folder, seemingly felt embarrassed about it when we saw it, then waded it up and threw it in the trash in front of me and my partner. Do they shred all the things that simply go into their waste baskets? Who knows, but I don’t think I would like my photo-copied ID just ending up in the waste basket and then the dumpster for anyone to obtain. Paranoid? Maybe, but I should have known then that I was dealing with someone who is either new or just doesn’t know how to handle situations properly. 

I digress…

I would have had no problem being told I was denied – I went into this whole thing thinking I would be - but to know I would have been approved had Austin Sub not been incompetent, to know that they were too cowardly to be up-front about the situation, AND to find out they did something SO detrimental that it cannot be corrected, I have a BIG problem. Not that they care, and not that anything can be done to fix this, but if I can’t get in-house financing from Toyota, Honda, or some other reliable car-maker, I will either have to get another crappy vehicle or pay $700 a month for a rental for the next three months.

Nate Lowther didn’t care. His manager didn’t care. The financial person who ran my app didn’t care. They strung me along and then thought ghosting me was an acceptable way to handle such a horrible situation that could have been avoided.

As I write this, no one from Sub Austin has even told me I was approved or denied. The salesperson at the unrelated Sub in Georgetown was the one who had to break this news to me, and he felt horrible in having to do so. Again, these two dealerships are not even owned by the same people but I had to go to Georgetown to find out what actually happened.

Nate, I still believe that you and whoever you worked with on this should be ashamed of yourselves for not being forthcoming. I might have used the F-word to describe what you and your finance person did to me, but I believe using it once to emphatically let you know exactly what you did was justified and within reason. Seriously, you f***ed me.

--Or is there another bank out there to which you haven’t tried to submit my information – with info that experienced folks in your industry KNOW will return an automatic denial? Georgetown told me that my last actual pay stubs were still usable and they were actually using them to get me through. I got tiered and then ran into a wall because of the paperwork you all submitted to every bank possible.

Learn to communicate about the process and what is going on during each step. Learn that ghosting people just because you don’t want to be honest about what happened is not a trait suited for someone in your position. Most of all, I hope you learn that you can really put someone in a worse place than when they walked through your doors if you don’t know what you’re doing.

4572,4536,27-Jul-19,"I came in to Mike Calvert Toyota to buy a used 2019 Toyota Corolla that I saw online. I asked about the condition of the car and was told that the car was a trade-in by a rich kid who changed his mind about the car after a few months. The car was in pretty good condition, but had a few stains and scratches here and there, of which they told me could easily be taken out. I specifically asked if the car had ever been in an accident and they said “no way”. AFTER I put my downpayment down they told me they could no longer take them out. I was in a rush to get a car, so I put that aside and continued the purchasing process. After everything was finalized I took my car to a friend of mine and he ran his hand across the car and right away he said that this car had been in an accident, and not only that but that it was a terrible paint job and that’s how I could tell. He went ahead and looked up the VIN and lo and behold it had been in an accident and was actually received from the auction, so their little trade in story was a lie.

I went back to the dealer and the manager told me it was MY fault, because everyone who buys a used car signs a CarFax. I said regardless they should have been honest when I verbally asked, but they just continued saying it didn’t matter because the CarFax was signed. I did not recall signing a CarFax, so I asked to see it and that’s when they told me they ""accidentally"" forgot to present it with me. During this time, the general manager, Mike Grewenig, came out and instead of making the situation better he justified and defended what was going on. At one point he even rolled his eyes at me. Imagine a 60 year old man rolling his eyes at a 22 year old girl who just got cheated to and lied to by his employees. He then told me he was offering me to return the car and no other dealer in Texas would allow that.. That was another lie.. They are required to do so by law since not disclosing an accident is considered dealer fraud.

Nonetheless, I ended up keeping the car, because I was moving soon and out of a car, and didn’t have time to spend another 4 days car shopping and going through the closing process. 

This happened about a month ago, and what motivated me to write a review was the fact that someone recently had a similar experience. The manager repeatedly told me this was an accident and that he would assure it would never happen again, but here it is happening again. This dealership needs to be shut down or at least barred from used car sales. All the bad reviews come from there.. The only reason they have any good reviews are because of their new car sales. You can't really scam someone with a new car, but look at all of their bad reviews and it either comes from their sketchy used car sales or their terrible service department.

He immediately said yes. I was skeptical because of the quick response so I asked a second time to confirm and he again said that Mike Calvert Toyota had it. I thought, oh maybe this guy just really knows his inventory. Turns out Prince Adrian is just a scammer.

I drive the 45 minutes out to the dealer. Since Prince Adrian was busy (or hiding), another employee took over just to inform me that they don't have the car in stock... Not even one with a different trim... So either Prince Adrian straight up lied to me so that I would consider another car or he's just too lazy to check.

At that point I was angry, but didn't want to blow up at the innocent guy helping me. When I asked him to go get Prince Adrian, the guy says he can't because Prince Adrian is the manager and this guy's boss. Eventually I find Prince Adrian hiding in this glass employee area. I motion for him to come out and he refuses. I finally get him out and start asking him why he couldn't spend the time to check on the car before I drove all the out there. He just blows it off and says there's nothing he could do about it, too bad, and starts to walk away. (what??)  So I had a few choice words for him as he's walking away.

2)  They drop me off at work, no  complaints, not a word about anything, driver says to call him before 3:30 PM for pick up. I call at 3:00 PM and he says he cannot pick me up, i am all of a sudden too far by 3 miles. 
3) I call the office  and am told that i am on my own and basically too bad. No concern for my welfare, how i will get home from work, or anything humanity at all. Not even one inch of empathy. They could give a @$#@ what happens to me. Good luck he says on the phone with an attitude.
4) so they don't have a part they should have, it takes 24 hours to get the part, not likely. Then they refuse to pick me up with their shuttle out of the blue with no warning so i can make plans.

4590,4555,26-Jun-18,"I was there for regular maintenance, and was tole by the staff that it should take 1hr-1hr 15min. 2hr later, he came and told me that my coolant is leaking, that's why it takes so long. They showed me that the hose is completely broken and the coolant reservior is empty, and i was lucky that I bring it in today otherwise it'll heat up the engine and end up damaging it. But does it take them an extra hour just to figure out this? I strongly suspect that am I really that lucky that I come for maint just in time when my coolant is empty. There was liquid all over the engine and the reservior, which was obviously the coolant and the hose was completely broken and hanging there. So apparently, the resevior wasn't empty when I got there, and they broke and pull of the hose and emptied the coolant just to force me to repair it with them. I was aware that I have a leak in the hose, but there wasn't any alert of heat up issues telling me that it is leaky. But when they showed it to me, the hose was just  hanging there. I doubt that if it's completely broken and I could have never had issues with engine heating up. I asked if they have any solution just for today because i was running in a hurry, and they told me we can fill the coolant but it'll be empty again very fast if you have a broken hose, and it won't even last for today. So i don't have any option other than repair it right now with them. There change a big a chunk of money for this simple repair, which is understandable for a dealership. And even if they don't break it and just tell me it's leaky, I probably will just repair it there since I don't want to bother finding somewhere else and I always prefer genuine parts.

4619,4585,19-Apr-18,"I bought my car from this dealership and have taken it in for almost every maintenance service ever since, for 8 years running. In 2015 the car started shaking when applied the brakes so I took it in and they told me it was the front brakes. Now I take my car to this dealership because I trust that they'll use original parts and since they're trained specifically to fix Toyota cars the high premiums I pay to do it with them would be worth it in the long run if I didn't have rework it. When I drove out though I noticed that the shaking had subsided but there was now a popping sound when I applied the brakes. I called several times to complain and try to get it fixed but they told me only option was to come in and wait in line. Now every time I've gone I've no less than 4 hours there and up 6 hours some times. That's a whole work shift almost and that kind of time is not easy to come by. Finally everything in the car started shaking and I figured it was the alignment so I used that opportunity to take it back in and ask them to also look into the popping sounds. Of course they didn't find anything but I left with popping now reduced and the shaking back, even worse than before. Again with a busy schedule and not having a whole day to go spend over there I couldn't go back until December 2017. After another 5 hours or so they now told me I needed to have the same front brakes I just fixed a little over a year ago done again along with the back brakes. Their service representatives tried to use all kinds of arguments about mileage and driving styles. I drove the car on original brakes for 5 plus years and 3 times the number of miles and all of a sudden my driving style changed and I'm burning them up in less than half the time and not even a quarter of the miles? I went to the service manager who was gracious enough to offer to do the front brakes for free but I was going to have to wait another 2 to 4 hours. I was traveling to Nigeria for my wedding in a couple of days and had all kinds of stuff to still get done and couldn't afford to wait that much longer after having spent half of a whole day there so I left. Fast to this last visit, I was on vacation and already knew what they were going to say and I was hoping I'd at least get the same offer they had extended just a couple months back but the service manager that made the promise was not there anymore and conveniently there was no documentation of my ordeal to go on. The new service manager Jose changed the rhetoric to say that mileage and driving style dont matter, they just warranty their work for 1 year and that's it. Heck for a one year warranty I can go to autozone to buy my own parts and have the roadside mechanic on my street do the job for less than half the price. Personally I think the first guy that did the job just tightened the brakes without changing the pads that I paid for. There was no apology for a job very shabbily done or for endangering my life by making me drive on bad brakes for such a long time. All he offered was a $25 discount for each brake and basically told me I was lying about the previous manager offering to do the front brakes at no charge since it was a rework of a job I had already paid for that by all indications didn't get done to begin with. I drive almost an hour from house to this dealership to get my car serviced after having similar shady dealings at the Toyota dealership on Bissonnet and 59. At this point I think I'll just take my chances with the neighborhood roadside mechanic and at least save on the gas and wait time. Totally disappointed and betrayed.

It cost me an additional $830.00 out of my pocket and the dealership refused to help me.,1,98,0,0
4634,4601,11-Dec-18,"Wow, where do I begin with my experience here? On the 10th of November, I went to pick up my 'new to me' Ford Edge from Lithia Toyota of Abilene. 
I must say that I was ecstatic to be accepted even with my low credit! When I got there and picked up my vehicle and drove it for the first time, it felt amazing. I enjoyed the newer model, louder stereo, the smooth drive, the more powerful engine!

However, that experience would only last for about five days. That's when the trouble began. 5 days after I got the vehicle, I was making an exit
and my tool light came on and my speed and miles suddenly vanished. I wasn't able to tell how fast I was going, luckily I was on a hill so I eased into a parking space safely. When I got there, I turned the engine off and then turned it back on and the whole car shook and a big bang occurred. 
Remember, this is five days afterward. When I contacted the dealership, they told me it was an as is car. Luckily the financer hadn't closed out my contract so they were somewhat pressured to fix the car. Which Ford misdiagnosed the problem because there was no check engine or tool light on
when I took it. 

Well, the first problem got fixed. But that wasn't the end of my worries, no. I noticed that the rpm gauge was giving me problems and about 3 days afterward
the car just stopped in the middle of a turn, again, I was lucky to be in a parking lot! I was able to get the car to turn back on and was able to drive it. 
I figured it must've been from the cold night or something. Anyways, I drove it another day and then the tool light came on, the same exact issue occurred! 
Luckily I was able to get it home to where it completely died. My car in less than thirty days is completely out! It doesn't work. 

Oh, and that isn't mentioning the fact that they lied to the creditor and told them I'd been working a job for two years when I told them specifically
that it was my new job. I was told that there were new tires, and come to find out that they were worn and weathered pretty good. I was told
the car went through an extensive check, but from what happened, that was a lie as well!

So, I say don't buy a car from Lithia Toyota of Abilene! They very clearly sold me a Lemon. I am taking an L by losing my 1500 dollar down payment
but I am also taking an L on my credit because of the 14,000 dollars they wanted for the vehicle with the interest.

I messaged them, they haven't returned anything back to me. This is a sad situation I am in, but at least I can save someone else the hassle of going through this!

SO DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PLACE!!!",1,98,0,0

He went right in to all the negatives about our car in an effort to demonstrate it was not worth what we thought it should be.  As predicted, they offered less than the other two  dealerships we had it appraised at.  The very nice building seemed kind of cold...much like a business than a family atmosphere.  When we decided to buy our vehicle, we set up an appointment to complete the paperwork and pick it up.  We waited 1.5 hours after arriving just to get into the finance office!

My wife, who went in alone, was charged $86 for the oil change. She drives a 4 cylinder 2016 RAV 4.

4652,4621,30-Jan-20,"This is truly the most unprofessional Toyota I have ever encountered. It astounds me that this is now supposed to be the headquarters of Toyota, because the people that work there have no respect for customers shopping for a brand new car or those who already have the misfortune of owning one of their cars. A few weeks ago I got a flat tire very close to the Toyota dealership about an hour before they closed. When I called to see if I could bring the car in (even if they didn't look at the tire until the next day) but just so I didn't have to drive 15 miles away on the donut just to take it there the next day, the receptionist was so incredibly rude. It's one thing to say that isn't common practice, but it is another to be so dismissive and disrespectful to a paying customer. The next day I called again to see if I could bring the car in. (As a side note, the tires were bought from Toyota so they are under warranty) when I spoke to a different person the next day he said ""Warranty isn't a thing..."" I ended up taking the car to Toyota of Richardson, which is 40 minutes away from me just because I hated the idea of paying these disrespectful people to fix my car. I'm truly disappointed in Toyota, as we have had so many Toyota cars, but each time I interact with someone at this location I am reminded why it is an unfortunate excuse for a business. 

A few weeks prior to this, my family and I were searching for a new car for my uncle. We made the poor decision to try Toyota of Plano. While the saleswoman was running around like a headless chicken, we were waiting in the parking lot for a total of 3 hours. In this time, there were at least 2 instances where she disappeared for more than 30 minutes at a time. Car dealerships are supposed to convince you to buy their cars, not send you running in the opposite direction.
 
This location is so nice, new, and so close to my house but unfortunately a business cannot be run by a shiny building. It has to have people functioning inside that have some ability to interact with, and sell to customers. I truly would never do someone the disservice of recommending this location to them, and I highly recommend avoiding this joke of an establishment by any means necessary.",1,99,0,0

4654,4623,25-Jan-20,"I recently bought a used vehicle here and had an overall bad experience.  My salesperson was nice and let me have time to make decisions so this review isn’t so much about them as it is for the process, customer service of management, and wait time.  I spoke to a salesperson over the phone before coming in to ease the process and they knew which vehicle I wanted to see.  When I got there, I had to wait awhile until I was seen and the salesperson started talking financial goals, what I wanted for my trade in, and how much I was currently paying instead of taking me straight out to the vehicle I was interested in seeing.  It's probably took 25 minutes before I actually got to see the vehicle I came for.  Once I did decide to buy the vehicle a few days later, I had to wait again for 30 min in the lobby just to sign the monthly payment and offer agreement before being transferred back to a secondary holding area where I waited for another almost hour before I was seen for financing.  I watched multiple employees walking back and forth talking and laughing and not really working until I finally got up and asked someone if had been forgotten or what the next part of the process was.  Finally I was seen an hour later.  At this point it was dark and I had only seen the vehicle in the dark on the lot when I left on Saturday evening.  On Sunday morning I went to drive the truck and saw two large scratches and small dents that were not visible at night.  I immediately called the dealership on Monday morning and told them about what I found and asked if I could bring the vehicle back to have their touch up guys fix the scratches.  The manager said they already spent $150 on paint touch up prior to selling vehicle and denied the request.  I sent pictures of both day and night pics showing how the scratches are not real visible at night but very visible during the day and he still denied the request.  I would have expected a little customer service here to spend a few hundred dollars to remedy the situation since I spent close to $40K on a vehicle with them and they are listing my trade in for MUCH higher than what they gave me for mine.  Seems to me they have some profit margin there to touch up paint on a vehicle they sold to me as basic customer service and to keep me as a future customer.

4658,4627,03-Dec-19,"On Wednesday, November 20, 2019, my husband and I came in to see about how much we'd have to pay each month for a brand new Camry or CH-R. We were told that we'd be meeting with a certain salesman and one of the ladies at the front desk pointed him out to us and asked us to have a seat while we waited for him. As we were waiting, he began to walk towards us and took one look at us and walked the opposite direction. As if he considered us not worthy of his time or like we looked like we didn't have any money? Honestly, that was the RUDEST thing we've ever seen and it was beyond offensive! We really should've just left the place right after that but we figured we'd be GLAD to deal with anyone else other than someone like him. But boy, did it get worse after that!!! 

Shortly after, Zee Umar came to greet us and we told him which vehicles we wanted to look at. He was nice in the beginning but after the test drive and after we told him we were obviously not willing to pay a crazy amount each month for a car that we felt was not worth it, he became REALLY rude, EXTREMELY PUSHY and refused to take no for an answer! He used phrases like ""You just need to sign the paper"" when we were in the middle of trying to figure out why they were trying to get over on us with the monthly payment! He was CLEARLY angry and frustrated with the fact that we weren't pushovers and wanted to thoroughly understand what was being sold to us and at what price. His whole face turned red in anger as soon as things started to not go his way. He actually walked away from us to go and take a cigarette break!!!! He came back after a few minutes of just disappearing on us and reeked of cigarette smoke! What kind of salesman goes to take a cigarette break in the middle of a sale??? I guess we really stressed him out by taking our time with looking at the fine print! 

And now for the worst part of all. We had already given him our car keys in the beginning to have them value our trade-in. They offered us a decent amount for our car (the ONLY positive thing about this experience). However, the issue is that they basically held my husband and I hostage and WOULD NOT give us our car key back so we could leave the place!!! It was excuse after excuse as to why, after at least an hour, we STILL  were being forced to be there when we clearly expressed our readiness to leave. And just to clarify, they held our car key for over an hour AFTER they had already checked out our car for an appraisal! So they just didn't want us to leave. We just couldn't understand why they were forcing us to be there! Finally, it got to the point where I just said forget it, I have an extra key with me and we'll just come back and get it from them later. We had to pick up our kids from school in time so we just couldn't wait any longer or continue playing their games. Zee kept on being entirely TOO persistent and finally gave us our key back when he realized we didn't care anymore that they had it. We got out to our car to get in and he comes rushing out to the parking lot trying to tell us to just take the Camry with us and keep it overnight. We told him we didn't want the car and that we were leaving. He brought us our car key and it actually had a blue tag on it with all of our vehicle's information on it. And that's when we realized why they didn't want to give us our key back. THEY PROCESSED OUR CAR AS A TRADE-IN WHEN WE NEVER AGREED TO DO THAT!!!! He had already ""sold"" us the Camry even though we never even agreed to buy it! We hadn't signed any paperwork stating we'd buy or anything like that! 

As we were driving off the lot, Zee called us REPEATEDLY!!!! He called my husband's phone AT LEAST four or five times and called my phone at least three or four times all within a matter of a few minutes immediately after we were driving off the lot! We told him NUMEROUS times that we just were not interested in what they were wanting us to pay just to drive a Toyota Camry! I ended up having to block his numbers from my phone!

A few days later, I get an email from Toyota congratulating me on my purchase of a new Toyota Camry, advising me to register my new vehicle through some program called ""Toyota Owners"". He clearly processed a sale that wasn't even a sale and now Toyota thinks I'm driving their car! I was going to write this review the same day that I got the initial email from them but life happens and I didn't end up doing it. This morning, I get another email asking me to do the same thing. So that's what prompted me to go ahead and write this review. I'm not sure whats going on over there but my husband and I both agreed that this was THE ABSOLUTE WORST experience we could ever have hoped to NOT have with a dealership!!! I will NEVER return to this place ever again! And now I'll be calling over there just to make sure that we aren't going to be charged for a car that we don't even own! All this over a Camry that wasn't even my first choice. Though I liked the car, I told Zee that I was way more interested in a C-HR but he didn't even bother showing me what I truly wanted. He just wanted to sell me what HE wanted to sell me. Not what I actually wanted! Just an all around HORRIBLE salesman!

Oh yeah, the finance guy named Max also made our experience a bit more horrible but I'm really not going to get into that right now. It's just way too much to type and I've already written a book here. This has taken up enough of my time. Basically, he just didn't listen to our preferences or needs AT ALL! ",1,99,0,0
4659,4628,03-Dec-19,"I've bought 4 vehicles over the last 10 years from Toyota of Plano.  The last vehicle, a 2019 Tundra was purchased this summer from Edgar Posada & Mirza Begovic.  It was a positive experience.  So much so when it came time for my adult daughter (27) to lease a car, I sent her to Edgar and Mirza, told her they would take great care of her and knew she would walk away with a great deal.  You can imagine as a father sending his daughter into a car dealership that your confidence would have to be extremely high because after all, it new car sales, right?

After taking a half-day off of work, she reached out to me and told me that she could reach a deal because her payment was going up by well over $100 a month for a 2019 and the down payment that would be required was more than she had planned.  Disappointed - my impression was maybe my daughter was biting off more than she could chew with her list of ""must haves"".

A couple of weeks went by - then I received a call from her yesterday and she had independently reached out to an internet sales guy (no prior relationship) at Toyota of Grapevine who told her he would get her in the car she wanted.  Skeptical of the deal he presented I sent an email to Edgar and Mirza asking how this could be since I had trusted them to take care of her.  What I received back from Edgar was a nasty email telling me it wasn't possible.  Then, guess what?  10 minutes later (this time he didn't cc in his boss Mirza) he admitted that he was filtering the wrong source on Toyota of Grapevines website.  Needless to say, I was surprised by his email because he didn't have his facts straight and second, he insulted me as a customer.

Three hours later, I received a call from my daughter who was driving home in, not a 2019 but 2020 Rav4 where her payment barely went up and her down payment was half.  So much for Toyota of Planos ""Friends and family"".  If this is how you treat family - no thanks.

I'm embarrassed that I sent my daughter to two guys that didn't take care of her and two guys that I trusted.  Not sure what I was thinking - this is why car salesmen have the reputation they they have.

My advice to you - don't go see these guys.  Go to Toyota of Grapevine where you can walk in off the STREET and get a better deal than you can from someone you've done business with. - oh and not receive a nasty email from them to add insult to injury.

I was there yesterday and had the last service done before the warranty expires. Today, I took the Camry to get it inspected, where I saw the mechanic take out the engine air filter--it was clogged with leaves and filthy. It had NEVER been changed by this dealership and it was never mentioned it needed to be changed!!!!  I had the inspection mechanic replace it with a filter that cost about $20 and took the filthy one with me to see the service manager at Toyota of Plano, Dan. I told him these facts, assuring him that I would never return to this dealership again, nor would I be buying my next Toyota from this dealership (which I plan to do very soon). So, to save the cost of this filter, they lost future service on my current car and the possibility of selling another one. I now wonder if the oil changes, tire rotations, etc., were EVER done!!!!

I was under the impression that when you spend 45K on a new car the only time you need to return to the dealer is to buy accessories and get maintenance.... this truck has been returned 3 times within 520 miles.

4672,4644,26-Jul-18,"I have now been to Toyota of Plano two times and neither visit has been pleasant. I'll explain...

First visit - I called to make an appointment to have the oil changed and tires rotated on my truck. The day they had available I had an appointment at school that I couldn't miss. I ask the woman who is helping me make the appointment how long and oil change and tire rotation takes. She says an hour, an hour and a half at most. I err on the safe side and make my appointment 2 hours before my school appointment. I arrive 15 minutes early and I stand in the service bay next to my truck for 12 minutes before anyone even acknowledges me. 12 minutes is a long time when you're just standing there awkwardly. Finally someone comes to help and gets my paperwork together. They take me into the service advisers office and before doing anything I confirm with him that I will be out in less than 2 hours. His response? ""I can't promise that"" I explain my school appointment and that the woman I made the oil change appointment with said an hour and a half max. He shrugged and suggested I take their shuttle. Fine. He asks where I am going and it's 8 miles away. He immediately responds that the max for the shuttle is 7 miles. Really?? You aren't completing the work on my truck in the time promised and you are going to argue with me over A mile?! And to that point - an oil change and tire rotation takes 45 minutes max so 2 hours is more than generous. Finally he agrees to shuttle me to my school appointment and tells me just to call or text him when I am done to have the shuttle bring me back to the dealership. So as I'm wrapping up I call and text him to which I get no response. So I call the dealership and just tell them to send the shuttle. OVER AN HOUR LATER the shuttle arrives. I get back to the dealership and the adviser is nowhere to be found, I end up getting helped by someone else. And not to nitpick but they ran my truck through the wash and it came out looking worse than when I brought it in.

Second visit - I receive a Service Bulletin that my ECU needs to be reflashed. So once again I make an appointment. At least this time I was greeted in a timely manner when I arrive. The guy gets my name and off he goes. He's gone for probably 5 minutes (meanwhile its over 100 degrees outside and I'm just standing there). Finally he returns and says that they can't get me in today and I should leave my truck until tomorrow. I have an appointment! And its 4 hours prior to when the service department closes! He offers no explanation and leads me to the service advisers office (Chris Kim) who said he needs 5 hours to complete this SB. Ha! It's a reflash, it takes just a couple minutes on Techstream. Once I call him on his BS he tells me that he is backed up and won't be able to do it today. What aggravates me the most is that they couldn't be bothered to call or email me letting me know that they needed to reschedule. This dealership isn't close to me so round trip I was on the road for over an hour and wasted my gas. Do I get an apology? A free car wash? Any kind of empathy? Not even close. Chris just tells me I'll need to come back and goes back to his computer. Un-freaking-believable the lack of customer service this dealership has. What's funny is that I planned on looking at one of the used cars they had on the lot while I was waiting on the reflash. But I can confidently say that I would NEVER buy a car from these clowns.

Moral of the story - STAY AWAY FROM THIS DEALERSHIP!

515,4646,10-Jul-18,"I purchased a car here and one of the finance managers (John Fulgoni) added gap insurance and an extended warranty without asking me. He told me that my monthly was a little higher because of the finance rate that I qualified for, and that I got a warranty for free because I worked at Toyota Corporate. All turned out to be a lie he used to leach commission from me.

Some time later I checked my loan amount and it was about $2,000 higher than I remember the value of the car. I went back and they told me it was because I signed up for the warranty, etc. Needless to say, I was extremely upset. They even produced a document where I had signed off on the lower rate and then the document where I signed off on the higher rate. They're great at confusing their customers to increase their bottom line.

I spoke to the manager Tony Pan and he refunded the gap insurance after many months of back and forth, but refused to do anything about the extended warranty because I had used it (car was leaking pretty much right after I drove it off the lot, I was also encouraged to use my ""free warranty"" by the sleazebag finance manager that added it for me). Extended warranty itself cost me $1,700. 

The team dragged their feet over 2 months trying to ""help"" me but in the end, I'm stuck with what I, admittedly, signed off on. But beware of John Fulgoni, he is a lying xxxxxxx through and through, and denied everything. The managers refused to help me.

516,4648,24-May-18,"I went to Toyota of Plano as it was the closest dealership to me that uses the USAA car-buying service. 
I emailed with a salesmen named Roberto, who gave me a quote for a Black RAV4 XLE.
They quoted me a price, and I set up an appointment to look at the car, and possibly even buy that day.
When I arrived, I was excited, because the salesmen said he does not push things on people that they don't need, like leather seats, add-ons, higher trims, etc.
However, when we went to look at the RAV 4's they had in stock, he ""couldn't find"" the black XLE we had discussed prior.
He showed me a bunch of other colors with different trims, and tried to convince me to like other colors, like blue or white, and then started trying to convince me that I should get the blue RAV 4 limited with leather seats and ""upgrades"" which include a cargo net/privacy screen at an extra charge... (funny, because he said when we first got there he would not do this)..
Then finally we found a black RAV4 XLE, and he led me to believe that was the one he quoted me for, so we test drove it.
I was super excited and ready to buy it.
Once we sat back down in his office, he went to financing to get total price, when he came back it was THEN that he told me this was not the vehicle we discussed, and it was about $5k more, which in his words, ""is really only like $60 a month - you can do it"".
I asked him why he did not have the car we had discussed prior, and he said that he had tried calling me multiple times today to let me know the car was ""about to be sold"" and I needed to come in immediately, etc. I told him I had not received one phone call, email, anything from him today.
I told him we will go home and discuss it, and also go to other dealerships to see if they have the car I want at the price I was quoted by USAA car-buying service.
After this, he warned me ""to be careful, because what a lot of salesmen do is tell you the price and say they have the vehicle in stock, then when you get there they change it up on you and don't have the vehicle or the price is more"" - I laughed at this, and told him ""oh, like you just did to me"" to which his reply was ""oh, but this time that really happened...""
Already having a bad taste in my mouth about this guy, I got up to leave, then he grabbed the price quote for the higher priced XLE from my hand, and said I could not take that.
I asked him why not, and he said that it is Toyota of Plano's property - and is not to be taken home, or shown to other dealerships. I then went to take a picture of it then if I ""couldn't take it"", in which he grabbed it from the table and said I could not do that either.
It was the most shady experience I have ever had at a car dealership, and I will NEVER go back here again and will always warn friends/co-workers to not go here as well.

I eventually went to Atkinson Toyota South Dallas and the 45 minute drive was well worth it as the salesmen gave me the price he quoted me via email as it should be. They even threw in free accessories at NO CHARGE. I refer everyone there now.

The dealership will treat you really well when you are purchasing a new car, but they will trash you afterward. I purchased a new prius 4 which the SAFETY feature is malfunction. I told them and the sales manager Moe had test drove it and acknowledged the problem as well. I went through a lot of hassles with their service department to just get it check up. Zach from the service department and their technician didn't even know how the PCS and ICS work. They claimed that the car doesn't have the safety features and the PCS system doesn't even break the car for you. So I had to do my research and educate them about the system. They inspected the car and told me there is nothing wrong with it, but I found out later that they just simply plugging it to a computer without properly test driving it and make sure that the safety feature works. I was looking for help from the managers (Moe, Noel, Kash), but they never return your call, and even if you visit them in person, they will try to make you wait in the lobby or just kept pushing responsibility to others. I was frustrated so I ended up calling Toyota and they said they will contact me in 2 business days which they didn't. Finally, Tony Pan called and scheduled a time with me, which I had to take time off from my work for the appointment. At the time of the appointment, I had to wait for more than an hour for him because they had a weekly meeting that he had to attend. Later, he didn't even apologize for the wait. Basically, they claimed that if the car doesn't show warning sign on the dashboard then it's fine. That's pretty much how they determine that if your car works or not.

A real good dealership is the one that provides excellent after-sales service like my saleswoman Bucks did, she did everything she could to help me resolve the issue and I truly appreciate her help. Toyota makes good cars that rarely have problem initially, so my advice for you is that you can still buy car from the dealership and hope there is nothing wrong with your car. If it does have problems, and they don't take care of you the first time, then just file complain with Toyota (800-331-4331).

When I arrived at the dealership and inquired about this special discount, he proceeded to give me several excuses about why they could not honor this price. He blamed it on a miscommunication, even though the email was sent from Taylor himself. 

After making a few phone calls, I decided I would try a few other dealers that could offer me a lower price than MSRP.

I know, give me an example. I was promised my new plates would be mailed, instead I get a call saying drop by when it is convenient. Is it that difficult to put the plates in the mail, without reminding the personnel? Another example--I called my salesman, Ali, to look into something for me. Does he call back? Nope, nor answer the question. Instead I call back weeks later, and ask once again. Even worse, I asked another question that I need to know about my new car. Does it matter?

i had already been in a car that was excellent to me for the past 3 years. payment were high so i thought lets get a truck about the same payments and get more use out of it.
well that's after the application got filled out and the used car salesman crap came out making promises that could not be fulfilled. i picked out a truck they could not get me into it with out some huge down payments 4000 to be exact. and a co signer ?
wait a minute I'm current on my payments have not made one single late payment and you telling me what. so I decided to to drop it. 3 days later the calls me back and says hey the blue truck you liked i can get you in.  great lets do this went back down and now they needed more verification more paper work on my side ok got that together cool done.
so after all that and now the paper work and title transfers are completed .

the manager Todd Counts was sorry and gave me 3- 6.00 car wash coupons like that's going to make a huge difference for the hours I spent dealing with lies and used car salesman words of deception. so now i have the vehicle in my possession and the bank has to have more information and needs more information from me and if I don't get this done by 5 o'clock today i have to return the truck that I already have had fr 5 days!! and it's 3 o clock in the afternoon! so with lots of hustle and frustration I call todd and he sheffles me off to another salesman and doesn't even deal with me anymore just shuffles the problem off to another person  so with many phone calls and lots of emails and screen shots the deal is finally done long story short do you homework !

So I didn't want to deal with the dealership with the lease return and decided to contact Volkswagen credit directly to purchase the vehicle, so that I wouldn't have to pay the 20k mileage overage cost. I secure the loan through VW credit for the purchase and I get a call from Travis the leasing manager at Clay Cooley VW Richardson. He says that I will have to pay the TT&L straight from my pocket if I purchase through VW credit. So I go to the  dealership to execute the loan and roll in the TT&L. When I show up he is eager to show me a new lease, I told him I came to purchase and he claimed that If I lease another vehicle I would owe nothing on the old lease.
So since this was the reason I was going to purchase the vehicle to avoid the mileage charge on the old lease I went ahead and signed up for a new lease and I left happy. Well surprise, I received an letter in the mail 3/26/2019 that I owe $5K for mileage charge from old lease, I called VW credit and they claimed they don't do what I explained the dealership described. I call Travis the same day and he lied to me and claimed that no he only was talking about my last payment not any lease return charges. It makes me sick to my stomach and very angry that I was taking advantage of.

4772,4757,25-Dec-18,Clay Cooley put a new water pump on my 2016 Volkswagen CC under warranty in July of 2018. By December 2018 it was leaking worse than it was before. I took it back to them since it was still under the parts warranty so they could do it again. I am guessing that the Tech did not follow the strict procedure in the manual that says the pump must be carefully seated on the alignment pins and then the bolts have to be torqued in a very specific sequence to a very specific torque value. This must be followed very carefully or the composite pump can be damaged or may deform over time. The Service Writer (Alex) tried to tell me that my engine was leaking oil on to the pump and this caused the gasket to fail. I do my own oil changes so I know that my engine does not leak oil. I told him he would have to prove to me that the engine was leaking. He said the Service Manager would have to look at it. A little while later he called and said they would replace the pump under warranty (because the engine wasn’t leaking and they couldn’t prove that it was). I was then told that they would only replace the pump if I replaced the oil separator and took off the catch can that I installed to protect my intake ports and valves from the oil and varnish the PCV system allows in to the engine (a know problem on all direct injected engines).  In the process of removing the Catch Can they damaged one of the clips on a hose making it useless (their way of making sure I could not put it back on).

4773,4758,23-Aug-18,"I have been trying to get a warranty refunded for *A YEAR*. Clay Cooley has been hostile the whole time. We just filed a complaint with the State of Texas. He is our experience. DO NOT BUY FROM THEM. We filed a hostile dealership form with the warranty company, who has since refunded clay cooley and they have NOT PASSED THIS MONEY BACK TO US. 

I purchased a car with Clay Cooley Richardson on 8/5/17, I was upsold into also purchasing:
- an AWS extended warranty [$3854], and,
- an AWS maintenance agreement [$700].

When I was able to research the two agreements I realized I was still under manufacturers warranty so did not need an extended warranty and the maintenance agreement was far more expensive than paying for maintenance with a genuine mini dealership.

I gave written notice to cancel both contracts (via email) on 8/15/17 @ 8:47am

I followed up on a response to that cancellation email on 8/15/17 @ 9:47pm

I followed up again by email on 8/18/17

I followed up again by email on 8/23/17

Through this period and the end of 2017 I routinely called Clay Cooley and was repeatedly assured that the cancellations had been sent and that service cancelations just take months to process. Despite asking I was never provided with any evidence they had processed the cancellation

In early 2018, I visited the dealership in person and was greeted by a new finance manager who filled in the cancellation backdated to the initial notice date and faxed it to the service providers.

Again I saw no refund at my end and repeatedly called Clay Cooley to be assured it takes time for cancellations to be processed.

Finally, around May 2018 I researched and called the service providers [The Warranty Group] directly and discovered that both policies were still active and they had no record of ever receiving a cancellation notice.

On 5/12/18 I sent the cancellation form from the dealership to their claims department, who forwarded me to the accounts department who assisted me with doing a customer initiated cancellation.

I provided all required documentation for the customer initiated cancellation on 5/14/18 and received confirmation they had been canceled on 5/18/18 with the refund credited to the dealership as they were unable to directly refund to my finance.

I called and contacted through their website Clay Cooley to inform them of the cancellation. I also gave notice to my finance in case they could assist the process. 

When I saw no refund forthcoming, I again repeated called Clay Cooley to follow up. I also followed up with the service providers and requested a receipt for the cancelation on 7/23/18 and was provided one on 7/30/18

I visited the dealership in person again on 8/10/18 and was assisted by a finance team member, however, they claimed not to have access to see why the refund had not been processed. Following up today they have left the company and their contact details disconnected.

That pretty much sums up my experience with Clay Cooley. I would be surprised if even 50% of my calls have been answered, and then usually only by a receptionist that has forwarded me to a number that has rung out. I have left dozens of voicemails which have never been returned. Their only email contact information is through a form on their website which has always been responded to by calls from their sales team who quickly hangs up when you ask to be forwarded to finance/accounts. I have never recieved a call from finance/accounts either in response to contact from me or reaching out to me to help close out this matter by email or phone call. The few times I have visited in person, the person I met with has left the company within a few weeks.

I had possibly the worst sales experience of my life here. Their sales culture is predatory and horrible. Don't waste your time or money. 

I stopped in because I'm a returning VW driver who wanted to upgrade to an SUV, and had sort of settled on the Tiguan. The test drive was actually pretty good. The salesman did a bad job of reading me and kept going on with his own little pre-planned speeches without really listening to me, but was overall pleasant and knew his stuff. The car itself felt like a natural upgrade from my Jetta and drives very similarly with a lot more power. However, I made the mistake of saying that, because the salesman clearly thought he had the sale in the bag and tried to screw me over.

Long story short, they asked me what I was looking to pay, evaluated my car for trade-in, took forever to crunch the numbers (because the salesman was taking a personal call) and came back at 266% of the price I told them. I understand how the game is played and they have to make money, but there is a BIG difference between $300 and $800, and they made little effort to work with me. Essentially they wanted to milk me for every cent without even trying to please the customer. After about 5 rounds of back and forth and they refused to come much closer, I walked out. However, they still had my keys from evaluating my car for trade-in, and REFUSED TO GIVE THEM TO ME. That's right, they HELD MY CAR HOSTAGE so the manager could come out and brow-beat me for another 15 minutes. I finally got them to give me my keys back and high-tailed it out of there.

The best part is that they had a trainee shadowing the salesman. When he went off to make his personal call...I mean, crunch some numbers, the trainee told me that he didn't like their sales culture, that the managers were a bunch of jerks and vultures and that he had an interview next week and is likely leaving them. Way to instill confidence in the customer, genius. And then when my partner and I walked outside to look at the vehicle again and talk, he didn't even give us 15 seconds before following us out and hovering. We walked back inside, he followed again, and I had to angrily ask him to give us some space because he can't take a hint. If he weren't already leaving or if I thought they actually cared about improving their sales culture, I'd call tomorrow and tell them to fire him.

4815,4803,29-Nov-17,"My rating for this company would have to be poor when dealing with used vehicles. This may not be the case with buying new, but do not buy used. I communicated with a sales rep 2 weeks before I purchased my vehicle. I explained I was 6 hours away, and would have to get a babysitter so I could take my wife up there with me to drive the car back( I had a job an hour away so I would just drive to work and she would drive back home) the only questions I asked: is the car in good condition, and has it been wrecked. The pictures looked great and I was told everything was good except the seat extension inside. We communicated multiple times up to the day I left after work, drove ?till 1:00am? got a hotel room then woke up and left out early to be there early enough for me to still be able to work when I got back to paris, TX. When I showed up everything was great till we walked out to see the car. There where scratches on both driver side doors, the front quarter, back quarter and runs in the paint on the bumper(runs in the bumper meaning most likely it was replaced, but there was no information about that). I’m not a real picky person but these where extensive. When I mentioned them the rep said it’s a used car. It’s going to have some scratches. So I took him out there to look at it, and he immediately agreed something should have been said about it before I drove 6 hours and rented a room. After that I told them I need 500 off in order to get it looking descent(my father inlaw owns a body shop. He quoted me 1200$ I just planned on fixing the 2 doors and maybe the front quarter) but they said their guy could do it for 200$ so that’s all they would take off. So I asked if they would do it and I would pay the original amount… then excuse after excuse. One guy kept telling me they do all their work on the inside of the vehicle, and that he personaly would prefer a company that fixes the mechanical issues over someone that just covers it up… needless to say the check engine light came on before my wife made it home. So In summary they told me: I should have asked specifically about scratches…. I just asked if it was in good condition assuming they where professionals. And I was told I should have had someone come look at it for me… you know, cause I guess I could have asked my buddy in Houston to drive up there lol. Probably would have only been a 8 hour round trip for him. No matter what effort you put into making it there under false pretenses of the vehicles condition, don’t expect much compensation. We agreed on 23500$ 2 weeks prior then when I told him I would have to either drive my wife back home lose a day of work then drive back(12 hours of driving) he told me he could go down 200$ so after almost pleading with them for 2 hours we ended up at 23200$ so expectation: nice car for 23500. What I got scratched up car that will cost 1200$ to fix and a check engine light warning 3 hours out … but hey that 200 payed for gas.

Initial diagnosis was replace the electronic steering wheel lock module for around $800. Agreed to that service charge. The car has been very reliable for years and that was reasonable to get another 150,000 or so miles out of her. 
Update from their 'Service' department. It needed a new Comfort module, since the new steering wheel lock module was not compatible with the old Comfort module.

""I will give you a call tomorrow and update you"", this is an empty promise coming from the mouths of anyone working at Clay Cooley VW.

Due to character limits I have summarized my email to Stephen Dodge the General Manager. He has not responded:
•	October 24th I visited Clay Cooley VW and asked to see a car listed on Clay Cooley VW website for 27000.
•	The offer sheet appeared with 4000 of accessories. I explained clearly that I did not expect any cost of accessories as the list price had been 27000 and that I would be leaving. The salesman asked me what price I had expected to pay. I answered, ""The 2700 plus Tax, Title, and License"". He asked to write this number down and he would take it to the finance manager. I agreed with him at that time to pay 28500 which included Tax, Title, and License. This can be found on the offer sheet, which I have a copy of.
•	At this stage, there had been no issues.
•	The paperwork dragged on till 10 pm. My wife and I had to leave as the babysitter was not staying any longer. We were asked to return the next day to finish the paperwork.
•	The car was empty on gas.
•	The car did not have the temporary plates on the car as the salesman could not find a screw driver. Rather it was jammed in the window. I had to correct this myself.
•	We returned evening of the 16th. The financing manager began having us sign the paperwork without review. As my wife was signing and I was co-signing, I was entertaining our son. As the paperwork does not clearly state the ""sale price"", she did not catch this error. It is also written as ""total amount financed"" and it is unclear if this did or did not include the 3000 down payment I had already made.
•	My wife did however notice that my name had been written incorrectly and the paperwork had to be re-printed or corrected.
•	After discovering the issue by asking the financing manager, I immediately informed her that this was not what had been promised to me. I asked her what I could do and who could help me. Her only answer ""No one is around this late at night and besides you already have a great price"".
•	Sales manager does not remember even to take the keys of my trade in and I had to return to turn them in.
•	I placed complaints with the customer service representative Mercedes Delgado and the Sales Manager Dwayne Johnson.
•	Dwayne listened about my experience and offered me a 500 dollar refund, but he was unable to refund without higher permission the correct amount which is closer to 1500. He ensures me that he will submit the necessary paperwork and update me the next day.
•	Weeks pass with many unreturned voicemails and failed promises to call me back.
•	Someone from the sales team calls me to ask if I am still interested in purchasing an Atlas. This is the THIRD such call I had received, but I have chosen not to and all of them to reduce clutter in my massive list of disappointments. At this time I learn that both Dwayne and Mercedes have quit or were let go. No one knew about my complaint or planned to follow up.
•	It is now around December 7th and I am forwarded now to Paul Farris, who I AGAIN must explain my complaint to.
•	I decided at this point to visit in person. Introducing myself to Paul Farris, he had naturally forgotten my name and who I even was. I AGAIN reminded him about my issue.
•	Regretfully Stephen Dodge was at the corporate office this day. Paul Farris promises to call me with an update once you return. I was not called.
•	It took 60 days to call me regarding my license plates.
Now 57 days after agreeing to purchase the vehicle, I receive my first actual answer to my complaint... via email, no phone call. It told me that I signed a contract and they will not reimburse me anything.

How do you allow in your institution so many sloppy, incoherent, and lazy behaviors?

Perhaps most importantly, how do we go from Dwayne Johnson offering to refund me 500 dollars to 0 dollars?

Lesson: Double check all of their work in advance!

526,4839,01-Dec-18,"Classic bait and switch.

Here’s the my cautionary tale about dealing with Clay Cooley VW of Park Cities.

Made an inquiry early in the week.  The person I spoke with said it was a “reasonable” offer and someone would follow up with me. Crickets. So I called back the next day and spoke to another person who again said that my offer was “reasonable.” And again, no follow up. Today a new person called me.  I reiterated my offer.  This new person again, using their stock phrase, said my offer was “reasonable.” She said she would take it to her manager and then get back to me.  She called me back 15 minutes later and said they accepted my offer.

Even though the process had been a little sloppy, at this point I had no reason to believe they were dishonest.  But the first red flag was when I asked the sales person to text or email me the details and she didn’t.  No worries, I left work early to go to the dealer to complete the transaction. When I arrived, second red flag was when I saw the car that I had agreed to buy sitting in the showroom and not prepped at all.  So at this point I’m greeted by another new guy because the person I spoke to on the phone had left and the person she told me to ask for when I arrived was supposedly busy.  Spoke to the new guy and I gave him the details, which I’m not sure why they didn’t have already.  After some back and forth, the manager come out and says there must have been some sort of miscommunication because although I had been only discussing one particular vehicle the entire time with a higher level trim, the sales person was actually offering the base trim.  The funny thing about this explanation was that if this was true then my offer would have been significantly higher than MSRP. But whatever, they had wasted way too much of my time.

You would think they would have learned something from the VW emissions cheating scandal.  But then again, maybe they did. Maybe they learned how to cheat their customers.

Learn from me, try another dealer that actually respects their customers to deal with them honestly.

Another reputable auto repair shop completed a thorough diagnostic test on my car and informed me that the problem was related to an ABS module. They contacted VW and learned that there is an open recall on this module and suggested that I take my car to VW. I scheduled an appt. w/Clay Cooley VW the following day. In a nutshell, Peter the service rep operated with zero integrity and attempted to defraud me. I believe that Peter did this to justify the car not being ready and to buy more time. I immediately escalated to the service manager - John. Instead of John remaining neutral to fully understand ""the customer"" concern, he was defensive, deflected from Peter's detestable actions, and stated VW requires my authorization to proceed with the thorough diagnostic test that takes a couple of hours and cost $140 before they can perform the recall repair. When I called back 20 minutes later to tell them I'm picking up the car, Peter arrogantly informed me that I can pick up the car but they already performed the diagnostic test, something else is wrong with the car and the cost is over $3,000. They will charge me $140 diagnostic fee because they already performed the test. 

Note that after John's (service mgr) response, I reached out to another VW dealership to perform the recall repair. I called the other dealership back and informed them of Peter's last statements. Because  of the other VW  dealership intervention directly with Clay Cooley, when I picked up my car a hour later, John stated that it was ""not possible"" to perform the diagnostic test so they will not charge me $140.

4875,4871,08-Dec-18,"I’ve owned Volvo cars for over 10 years and have always loved them. We recently traded in our XC60 for a XC90 this year. We’ve been using this particular Volvo service center for about 3 years. This most recent service appointment was a HUGE disappointment. I scheduled the appointment with a loaner vehicle. This is one of the perks of buying a Volvo. For me having two small children (under age 2) while working full time and being able to drop off my car and use a loner vehicle while I wait is crucial to me. This appointment I was told there was no loaner car available but I could go through the rental company or wait in the lobby (with my two month old child). I explained I had scheduled the appointment with a loaner and the reply was “we run out of loaners all of the time.” Though this may be true, I have been coming here for 3 years and always received a loaner. So I went through the rental company which the Volvo technician saw my disappointment and offered to ride with me so I wouldn’t have to take a shuttle with my baby. Then about 1 hour later I was leaving the rental car company in a car substandard to what I’m used to driving. When I check on the car I’m told it will be ready end of day (peak traffic time) and I explained that will not work. I’m glad I didn’t wait the 7 hours in the lobby with my baby. I told my service rep what time I would be by to pick up my car whether it was done or not and would return if needed at a later time. My car was rushed and completed by the time I arrived but not washed and it smelled of gas which I had to wash out when I got home but not after driving my two children around with the smell. I expressed my complaints and was told the General Manager would be notified and requested he call me. But alas I received no call. I’m not sure why the significant change in customer service. Previously I gave consistently positive feedback. If there are not enough loaner cars that they are constantly running out then they need to offer less appointments with loaner cars or get more loaner cars. Completely dissatisfied with this visit. We were considering purchasing another car from this dealership but honestly we may consider a different brand all together. ",1,103,0,0

4889,4885,23-Aug-17,"During the last week of March 2017, I had my mom's 2001 Volvo towed to the dealership after store hours. I completed the request form and asked the service department to inspect the ECM and reinstall software.  In 2013, Volvo of Houston stated it required ECM replacement.  For three years the vehicle was non-drivable.  I decided to tow the vehicle to San Antonio, Texas from Houston, Texas in March 2017 (I year after my mom’s death).  I purchased the white 2001 Volvo V70 Turbo in 2007 (pre-owned) in San Antonio and through the years no major problems.  I expected some mechanical issues but not more than one major issue. On 7 April 2017, I was informed by Service Advisor, Kevin Nichols that I needed a throttle body installed.  During the installation, the mechanic broke a screw (fail to replace it). More than 10 days later, the mechanic couldn’t detect any issue with the ECM.  I informed Kevin that my mechanic had the vehicle running for 3 days prior to having it towed to Principle Volvo.  The mechanic tried both ECMs, the original one and the one I bought online at a Foreign Part store. The mechanic claimed not reading any codes on the 1st ECM (it wasn’t the original ECM) and no codes from the original ECM.  The replacement ECM just needed software download per advice from my mechanic Larry.  I was charged $1,416.16 for a car that was running for less than 2 hours.  Just enough time to drive to the Department of Motor Vehicle to register for license plate and to my home.  The next day, the vehicle wouldn’t start.  
Since I had to drive to Houston to see my older brother (dying of cancer), I decided to contact Kevin on 10 April 2017.  I left a voicemail on his office phone.  I received no call back from Kevin. Since I was too busy to return the vehicle within the month due to other obligations in Houston with my brother, I decided to wait until I had free time to do so.  I was driving to Houston on a weekly basis and sometimes twice a week prior to the death of my brother on 25 May 2017.  While sorting out his estate, I was overwhelmed with stress and anxiety.  
On 4 August 2017, I stopped by Principle Volvo to speak to the General Manager, Bill Baker.  I explained to him my reasons for visiting 4 months after I had the 2001 Volvo in the Service Department.  Prior to leaving, he indicated that he will pay for a courtesy tow (no obligation to me) for Monday, 7 April 2017 evening pickup. Both the Tow truck driver and AAA requested for my credit card.  I indicated the General Manager stated he would pay the cost for the tow.  I never imagined after my lengthy conversation with Bill, I would be lied to about the payment for the tow.  If I had known I would be expected to pay for the tow, I would have used my AAA membership that allows up to 4 tows per year.  On 10 April 2017, I was told the vehicle was ready for pickup after I declined having the mechanic replace the cylinder head and resetting the timing.  Also, the mechanic indicated debris was found underneath the vehicle.  The same vehicle that was driven off the premise on 7 April 2017 where there’s no debris in my driveway.  I honestly believed that my vehicle was tampered with.  After 7 April 2017, my mechanic started the vehicle 2-3 times.  After turning off the vehicle, it wouldn’t restart.  Not once did Larry state a problem with any belts or the engine.  My only observation, the mechanic had to check two ECMs and later decided it was something else instead of the throttle body (just to charge me with a costly part and be done with me quickly) or was tired of dealing with my vehicle.  The vehicle was at the Service department more than 10 days from March-April 2017.  I felt mislead and assumed no one wanted to own up to their mistake.  Before leaving Volvo, I had to pay $274.06.  I was charged $78.00 for the tow that was promised by the General Manager.  As a woman, my word is my bond. I was also charged for an unrelated charge of $11.06. What could possibly cost $11.06? Of course, the labor was $158.00.  I really don’t believe the vehicle was inspected.  
On 4 April 2017 after leaving Volvo, I decided I would one-day trade-in my 2008 Hummer and become an owner again of a 2017-2018 XC-90.  I was an owner of a 2005 XC-90 before purchasing my Hummer.  There’s no way I would want to purchase a Volvo and have it serviced at the only Volvo dealership in San Antonio, Texas.  My treatment during this time was incomprehensible and disrespectful.  When I had my 2005 Volvo serviced at the Volvo Service Department, I received nothing but excellent service.  If I had to rate both services regarding my vehicle on a scale from 1 to 5, my rating would be 1.

Her reply to me was that there was nothing wrong with it that the technician could find. I returned to have my car's regular maintenance taken care of and asked if they could check the AM radio and antenna. They did and told me they would have to order a new antenna and an modulator/isolator, not sure what they called it, and that it would be in a few days. Well, my advisor, who is no longer an advisor, failed to call me after over two weeks so I decided to call and check on my parts. I was told that the antenna was in and that it would be another three days on the modulator/Isolator part to arrive from Sweden. Two weeks later, after no update from my Volvo dealership, I decided to call again to check on the parts. I was told that they were in. I finally received an appointment to get my car fixed and I asked the person who checked me in, evidently I didn't have a service writer assigned to me and I was made fully aware of the situation as though I had control over it, to also check the truck liner and grip to close the trunk. (They seemed very ""loose and flimsy"" to me unlike the craftsmanship of car). Three hours later my car was ready and my radio worked magnificently. I went over the truck with the person checking me out and I told him it still seemed flimsy and I said to him, ""is that how it is supposed to be?'' and he said, ""yes"" with a shrug. I left because I had to get to an appointment, but the first chance I had I opened the trunk and pulled on the grip to close the trunk and the grip came out and I turned it over and could plainly see that it was broken.

I get a call after dropping off the car and confirmed that the battery does need to be replaced, so I'm thinking okay the usual $300-400. But then the service rep, Derek Starnes explains that the top engine pad needs to be replaced. I'm told this is part of the bracket that holds the engine block. I understand that labor is significant for a job like that, and I am convinced by this rep that the bottom should be done as well. He quotes me a grand total of $830 and I decide to go ahead and approve the work. But then this Derek calls me back again and says that the drivers side window has intermittent electrical problems. I decide to wait for a later time for that repair, as that would cost an additional $400-600. This is Friday when the completed the work; I told them I would be in on Saturday to pick up the car. So when I picked up the car, I didn't even think to roll down any of the windows in this hot Texas weather. Fast forward. This Monday morning, as I arrive for work, at the main security gate I attempt to roll down the window to swipe my access badge, but the window doesn't even work!

4895,4893,25-Apr-17,"I had a flat tire on the way into work Tuesday morning. The experience over the phone with Volvo Roadside assistance was great. The service center was very small so my tow truck driver had a very hard time dropping my vehicle off. Once the car was released, I had a pleasant experience getting my loaner vehicle. I asked for routine maintenance including an oil change since it had been a few months since I first purchased the vehicle. I was told my car would be done by 2 pm that same day. Around 1pm I received a phone call about the price of my tire and agreed to payment. I was told again that my car would be complete between 2pm - 3 pm and that I would receive a call once it was done. I never received a call. In fact the next day around 10 am I stepped outside of my office to give the young lady a call who was assisting me in this process and who had called me advising of the previous stated comments. She asked what my name was which I thought was crazy after she had spoken to me multiple times the day before and I told her immediately after she answered the phone that I was checking on my specific vehicle. She paused for a moment and said ""oh...I thought...can I place you on hold?"" I said sure and she came back stating that my car was finished yesterday. Not once did she apologize for not calling me back before leaving the office the night before. I told her I would be in after work. So, I pulled up and she brings me my bill which was incorrect. She then said she would get it fixed and have the technician change the air filter because all he did was an oil change and my warranty only covers at 100% if the full service was provided. Please keep in mind, that I worked in customer service for 3 years during college and even when a customer suggests they want/need a specific item/service I always tell them their benefits immediately. She goes on to tell me because all I asked for yesterday was an oil change that's what I was given. I told her that also mentioned that when I purchased the vehicle I was told my oil changes at this location were covered under warranty. Without apologizing she said that it would be a few moments to get the technician out to pull the filter into my car. She walks away. I then asks this very nice cashier if my children and I could have a seat in the waiting room because of course the young lady who was servicing me did not suggest that I do so before running off. It took about 5 to 10 minutes for the filter to be added. I paid and proceeded to my vehicle. Immediately after attempting to sit in my car, I noticed my seats memory had been modified and when I started my vehicle my gas light was on. The radio had been reprogrammed as well. Even if the battery was disconnected there would not be any programmed seating arrangements, mirror arrangements and/or radio stations. This led me to believe that someone who was much shorter than I was had been driving my vehicle. Lastly, I was supposed to get a new set of rugs at the time of purchase. Not once did I receive a call in reference to this so I mentioned it the day I dropped the vehicle off. The young lady in service said to me that she had given me a complete set because they come in a set of 4. I assumed they were similar mats to what I previously had since she only put one in my car. The set was a totally different mat and instead of her having all four replaced she put one mat in the passenger side. I previously owned a Mercedes before purchasing my Volvo and I never had any issues with reprogramming, my gas being driven out or when anything was replaced and did not match they went ahead and replaced all four. I had to come home and have my husband take the remaining 3 mats out of the trunk to put in himself. Overall, this experience was not the best.

4897,4895,11-Apr-17,"I had a 50,000 mile service done and while there I asked the service staff to have a look at a few other things; the digital screen display seemed to be sliding down into the console. The left front panel was not fully seated just behind the headlamp, and from a previous visit the console below the gear shift on the driver's side was not properly reinstalled after a warranty repair.
For the display I was told the housing frame shifted, it was not the digital screen that could be re-centered, so they wanted me to buy a new housing frame. I did not.
The left front panel seems to be properly in place now. Tool marks were left on the panel that indicate it was worked on.
The console below the gearshift knob query was not relayed appropriately from the staff to the service technician, as a result the service tech thought there was a problem with the gear shift knob and advised to buy a new one. The service tech explanation was the knob had a lighting problem which is most certainly does not. I did not purchase a new gearshift knob. So, after I restated my original request to look at and properly seat the console BELOW the gearshift knob it was done.
Additionally the service staff recommended a front brake job, rotors and pads, saying they were worn out of limits. When I asked the staff how much wear was on the pads to see if I needed them that day or could wait a little longer the staff person said she misunderstood the technician and that the pads were fine after all.
All in all, I assume the 50,000 mile service was completed without any problems, the car is running fine since the service, but I went in expecting to receive and pay for the service and have a couple of minor issues corrected that occurred during my previous visit to this service center. I was disappointed at the additional $1000 I was inappropriately (in my view) ""advised"" to spend for unnecessary parts and who knows how much more in labor.

When questioning the service advisor this last time the response received was that working under the hood while completing maintenance will sometimes cause other things to subsequently happen that require additional work.  I understand that sometimes parts do need to be replaced - it's simply the timing that has me baffled.
