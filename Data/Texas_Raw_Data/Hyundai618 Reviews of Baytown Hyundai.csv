1,"February 27, 2020","Dwayne Irchil is the best! I bought my new Santa Fe this past August and I love it! This is the second purchase from Baytown Hyundai. I know it is a late post, but I just happened to think about it. They are always friendly and ready to help. ",5.0
2,"November 19, 2019","In Sept, I was looking for a late model red Ford F-150, 2 WD.  I found one on Baytown Hyundai's website so I began an online conversation with a sales person.  I live about 5 hours away, so I wanted to be sure it was what I wanted before I drove to Houston.  I specifically asked if it had Sirius radio and was told Yes.  The next Saturday, I drove to Houston and made a deal on the truck.  As I left in the red F-150, I tried to tune to Sirius.  It wasn't there.  I immediately called the sales person I had used and she sounded genuinely surprised.  Apparently, she didn't actually check before she told me it had Sirius.  I told her I was turning around and we would have to undo the deal.  She called back in a few minutes and said she was looking at Sirius add-ons on Amazon and they were available up to $100.  She told me they would pay to have it added.  With that promise, I turned around again and headed for home.  When I got home, I got on the Internet and discovered she was looking at devices that could be added when the vehicle was 'Sirius-ready', which my truck wasn't.  My truck had to have a different device installed that would make it 'Sirius-ready' as well as the devices she had looked at.  I called an auto audio/video shop and got a price, installed, of almost $500.  I called Crutchfield and found the hardware for $349, without installation.  I sent her the written info from the audio/video shop and Crutchfield and asked her to verify the amounts by checking with some shops in Houston.  Later she called me and said the would up their offer of payment to $200 and that they were ""trying to be fair"".  I asked her if she really thought that was fair and that I wasn't trying to be difficult...I just wanted what I was told...the truck with Sirius.  At that point, her boss - who had apparently been listening - jumped in and angrily said they ""were already losing money and weren't going to pay any more"".  I reiterated to him that I was told in writing (email) that the truck had Sirius before I drove several hours to buy it and all I wanted was what I was told.  (Why was he angry with me?  It was his sales person that had messed up.)  He, again angrily, said he would reimburse me the $349, which meant I would either have to install it myself or pay someone to do it.  But I agreed just end the nightmare. I ordered the items from Crutchfield and faxed the invoice to the dealer.  It took 5 weeks and several phone calls and emails to get reimbursed. ",2.0
3,"September 23, 2019",Called Baytown Hyundai and spoke with Junior.  Told him car I was looking for.  Told me he had 2 with specs I was looking for. I told him I was driving 1 1/2 hours and taking half day off work to come purchase vehicle.  He assured me he had it.  When I got there he admitted he lied to me just to get me there hoping I would order.  Spoke with manager and he apologized.  Left dealership and an hour later another manager called and said the car really was available but wasn’t in system so another dealer couldn’t request it.  Wanted me to drive back and see car.  Why would anyone want to buy a car from a dealership with people so disrespectful...Not me..I will give my business to another Hyundai Dealer that has more respect for their customers!,1.0

12,"March 27, 2019","From the moment I walked in, until the moment Ms. Jennetta handed me the keys and waved me goodbye, my experience at Baytown Hyundai was one I will never forget. The process was quick and painless. I was never coerced, and the recommendations were spot on. Lee in financing was a wonderful gentleman as well. He laid out all of the details of the purchase, and made them clear and understandable to someone who isn’t in the car business.

17,"January 18, 2019",Went into the dealership on a whim. Looked at 2 cars just to see what they looked like. Then was about to leave saw a Nissan Rouge. The price was out of my budget. But we decided to look at anyway. Fantastic looking car. My 17 yr old daughter instantly fell in love with it. So the salesman asked my price range and I told him. Knowing the car was out of my price range he decided to check anyway. After some figures were thrown around I decided that my final number is all I can give and no more. He made my last offer to the owner. The owner proceeded to talk to me and he agreed to my terms. Totally a shocker but we got the car. I made one call to my bank and the deal was done. Truly a lightning bolt struck me in the heart. The owner a true professional and made my 17 yr old daughter totally shocked with the purchase. Being her first car she will never forget her first car. I would recommend this dealer to anyone who is about to buy a car to look at the dealer ship first. Hyundai of Baytown did me and my daughter an excellent deal. Stop by like we did and maybe you will go home in a new car. Just like we did,5.0

Kim was very honest and upfront with me and helped facilitate my pre-approval so that when I got there after work everything was pretty much ready to go.  Lee and the finance team worked really hard to get me into the car I wanted. I have had two Elantra limited and loved them, but I  needed something bigger with more room.  My third purchase is the Hyundai Santa Fe Sport Ultimate and love it!  I have always been a loyalty customer.  I have had nothing but good things to say about my Hyundai vehicles.  Nice features at an affordable price.  The vehicles sell themselves, but the people at Baytown Hyundai make the experience pleasant and comfortable.  I will continue to use them in the future for car needs and recommend them to others.  ",5.0
44,"August 04, 2018","I visited this dealership several times so I interacted with three of the salesmen and women.  Ash, Max, and Deno were all patient in that I showed up at closing every night and they insisted that I take my time.  They all allowed me to test drive the cars after closing and never pressured me to buy.  Maxanne called me back several times to revisit the dealership and was busy when I returned so she sent Deno to help me.  He was very personable and helped me decide on a reasonable purchase since I really didn't know what I wanted.  He patiently rode with me in several cars as did Ash and Max.  The only negative I experienced was when I went into the finance room where somehow a $1999 charge was added for GAP insurance.  The finance manager did remove it when I mentioned that I didn't agree to those terms and reprinted the paper for me.  ",4.6

I had to get the dealership service department to call the warranty place to replace the sensor. Paid $100 again. Drove it 65 miles and another engine light came on another sensor is out.  I can’t believe the dealership refuses to help out at all to see why the truck keeps losing sensors. Plus the fact the warranty I bought from them is not wanting to cover the cost to replace the sensors.,2.0

83,"January 30, 2018","Rating is for service department handling of request for service.....
Had a flat today after hitting a pothole.  Great AAA experience....on the road again in 30 minutes.  Then made the assumption I'd be able to get the tires (open to getting 4 based on my current mileage) from Hyundai dealer I purchased from.  Service department answer was they didn't have any and don't bother to stock any because they don't do enough tire business.  While I waited through a long pause for him to say when he could get some he repeated they didn't stock tires any longer and made no attempt to find out when or if he could get any.  I wanted to use the dealership in case any damage was found to the rim and it needed replacing also.
End result ... Discount gets the business and Hyundai Service Department gets a not so great rating.",2.7
84,"January 24, 2018","My saleswoman Jeanetta made my purchasing experience absolutely seamless! We test drove the truck I'd seen online, while the GM checked out my trade. As soon as we sat down to talk numbers, she calmly asked me what I would like to get for my trade. I told her, she walked over to the GM and spoke to him briefly and then waved me over. They gave me exactly what I was asking, as well as came down to the price I'd offered for the new vehicle. It literally took longer for them to detail my new truck than it did for me to test drive, discuss the finances, and close the deal (which wasn't long at all). Does that mean that I may have left ""money on the table""? Who knows? But what I DO know, is that both parties walked away... satisfied that a good deal had been struck. Couldn't be more pleased with my experience!",5.0

89,"January 08, 2018","Sorry for the short review.  I just spent over 30 minutes typing my experience both here and the horrific one at the previous dealer prior to coming to Baytown Hyundai.  Somehow it got erased by my inputting error.  So to bypass the very detailed review.  I assure you 100% that everything and everyone, with one minor exception (Sales Manager - can't remember his name) were completely on-board to all that was agreed to over the phone prior to my arrival.  Kim handled my call the day before and everything was agreed to (vehicle, price, trade in - estimation) prior to my coming there as a second stop.  I wasted my time, a lot of aggravation and flat out being duped and lied to over 5 times to try and swindle my business ""Ron Carter Hyundai of Friendswood, TX.  -- ""DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME GOING THERE FOR THE """" DEAL TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE""""  It isn't and won't happen.  In spite of my misfortune of the previous experience, Kim not only answered her phone from home (off taking care of 3 grandchildren ill with the flu,) but directed me to Ms. Roxanne, her co-worker and proxy, to complete our deal.  She assured me that Roxanne would take care of me and treat me just as she has and would if she would of been there.  The deal attempt from HEL_, the other dealership took over 5 hours long, this with my mind already made up on the car and stock number and no test drive required prior to my arrival.  The purchasing experience at Baytown Hyundai took just right at 2 hours, 50 minutes was my trying to decide on the 2018 Elantra Limited or Sport.  Ms. Roxanne not only knew all the details of Kim and my conversation but she met me at the door and addressed me with ""You must be Mr. Domingue and I am here to take care of you.""  This without her ever meeting me.  Very, very impressive. She handled all the details of the soon-to-be purchase and ran a quick 5 minute interference with the Sales Manager, knowing that I was just about to leave because of about $500.00 difference in the numbers.  Only one visit, then we finalized the offer/deal.  While waiting for everything to be put in writing I visited the parts department;  Ms. Priscilla there, stopped doing what she was working on and took over 15 minutes to get pictures, researching and pricing on a duplicate replacement rim/tire for my new vehicle as I don't care for the spare donut (the parts person at the other dealership couldn't or wouldn't take the time or effort to get me that information.)  Once done there, this while waiting on the promise paperwork to be completed before going into the finance office, I headed back to Roxanne only to observe her giving vital information about my pet peeves/dislikes on what would have me exit this dealership in a heartbeat should they resort to that sales tactic.  Many, many kudos, on a total team effort.  I ended up purchasing an extended Bumper-to-Bumper warranty 10 yr/100K miles, because I usually keep my vehicles around the 10 year mark.  It was very affordable, $1295.00 w/ 100.00 deductible per occurrence.  This unlike the other dealership that was trying to sell me a ""Wrap"" policy because the B-t-B warranty only covered electrical and mechanical (not computer, technology and electronics), this for right @ 3995.00.  Mr. Lee assured me bumper to bumper meant just that, except wearable items like belts, tires, brake pads and battery.)  The other location offered me 5.99% with my credit score over 800 and stated that they couldn't offer any better because of the dealer discount, rebates that I was already receiving.  My credit union quoted me 2.40% for 48 months, Baytown Hyundai got me 2.29% for 48 months.  Hopefully you can see the major difference in the integrity, professionalism and respect between the team at Baytown Hyundai and the scoundrels at Ron Craft Hyundai.   ",5.0
90,"January 07, 2018","I had already spent a couple of days shopping at other dealerships. I was getting tired of the ""hidden costs"" that weren't showing up in the Internet pricing, but were showing up on the printed ""deals"" presented by the salespeople.

In the midst of this frustration, Jeanetta called. She said something like, ""I know that those other dealerships will add on 'packages' to their Internet pricing. I won't do that to you."" Then she quoted a drive-out price that was below what the other dealerships had offered.

The next day, I drove to Baytown Hyundai and Jeanetta took care of everything. Baytown Hyundai delivered on their promised drive-out price with no surprises. Great job to everyone!",5.0

125,"November 18, 2017","My fiance and I just spent a WEEK negotiating a deal for a 2014 Jeep Wrangler that we both fell in love with. My fiance is active duty military and so I had to do most of the ground work with the salesman (who was great). Finally, I got a call today from our salesman saying that the manger said if I came today and signed my portion of the paperwork and paid the down payment I could leave with the Jeep today and they would mail my fiance his portion of the paperwork. So, at 5:40pm I got dressed and called up a friend to go with me to pick up our Jeep. I live in Friendswood and so Baytown is about 45 minutes away. As soon as I entered Baytown, excited to pick up our new Jeep I got a call from our salesman that the manager let another salesman sell our Jeep right out from under us. I spent a week just to come home with nothing. I am disgusted at their customer service and the way their manger conducts business. When my fiance called the manger to confront him he said, ""I don't care. They were here cash in hand. xxxx you."" I have never heard of a car dealership doing this. I can understand if we hadn't really made a decision on the vehicle but I was on my way to the dealership to sign for the vehicle. My fiance is active duty again after serving for 5 years already with the Navy and lost his vehicle during Harvey. It's very disappointing to me that Baytown Hyundai advertises deals for those who were affected by Harvey but don't deliver on that promise. our salesman also lost the commission he worked so hard for. Baytown Hyundai screwed us and their salesman on this deal. I would stay away from this dealership and find one that actually cares about their customers and sales people.

I will be back to the dealership for all my auto needs.  Not only is the sales and financial part of the dealership wonderful but they also have a fantastic service department that goes above and beyond to help.   Everyone at Baytown Hyundai went out of their way to help.  These people care and that's what makes them great.

395,"October 19, 2016","I drive a lot and I had a 2014 Genesis "" which I purchased new"" with 98K miles which I truly enjoyed with NO issues, however, the warranty was about to expire. I wanted to go in for a quick service call to make sure everything was ok before it expired. While talking to Fiaz, he explained he may be able to extend my warranty by purchasing a new unit. Making a long story short, Fiaz didn't disappoint. Not only was he able to get a total upgrade from the 2014 Genesis to a fully loaded New 2016 Genesis, but he was able to get me the coverage I need for a very fair price. I also want to shed some light on GM - Jarryd Van Oostrom and Client Advisor - Dewayne. Not everyday the GM comes out to thank me for my business and truly make me feel a part of the family. To you I would like to say thank you. My Client Advisor Dewayne took his time and made sure that I understood the new Genesis and the different options I had during car setup. Thank you for your attention to detail. I purchased my 2014 Genesis at this dealership and I can attest that loyalty goes a very long way with these guys. Thank you guys for all the service and advice and more importantly thank you for solving a problem with a great solution.

I had the most horrific experience at two other Hyundai Dealerships service departments in Houston and Texas City. I had given up hope! Baytown Hyundai was going to be my last resort to have my vehicle serviced. I contacted them and Ms. Charlotte went above and beyond to thoroughly explain the process and what my warranty covered and what my other warranty covered. She was so accommodating and even stayed a little late so I could pick up my car. I cannot express the customer service skills she has and the smile she greets everyone with. I recommend ANYONE to this dealership. I am going to even go one step forward and say the sales team is amazing as well. At the other dealerships my husband and I showed up to the other sales guys didn't even know if we were there to have our vehicle serviced OR looking to purchase a vehicle. They never approached us to ask if we needed help or not, I think they had glue to their chairs. But when we arrived outside Baytown Hyundai the sales guys literally fell over themselves trying to ask if we needed help. Then even when we said we needed the service department walked us all the way there never turning us away since we weren't buying and making them a commission.  Do I sound like a commercial? Well I am not. I did not even purchase my vehicle there but guess where I am buying my next one at?    ",5.0

I bought a brand new car there in July of 2015.  If you get the opportunity, work with Kim Woodburn in internet sales...she's the best!  Yes, she wanted to sell me a car, but also wanted to make sure I was getting exactly what I wanted.  She was patient, answered all of my questions, and found me the exact Elantra I wanted at a price I couldn't beat!

The follow-up service has been excellent as well.  I've taken in my wife's Santa Fe (2012) that was purchased at another dealership (still under warranty) and have never had a bad experience there.  John  O'Brien and Charlotte Lilyblade are very easy to deal with.  I won't tell you that they are the cheapest in town--because fixing a car isn't cheap.  What I will tell you is that they will be honest and fair.  The repairs will also be correct for what you need done--nothing more, nothing less.  

Every time I have visited this dealership, all of the staff have had a smile on their faces and greeted me.  Even Jarryd Van Oostrom, the General Manager, can be found walking around greeting his staff and customers with a warm smile and a handshake.

If you need a car, or you need service done, I'd highly recommend you look hard at Baytown Hyundai.  You will be hard pressed to find a dealership that treats you as well as they do there.

590,"September 09, 2015","After securing my wife a new(er) Sante Fe (at a different dealership), I decided to trade my 2012 Ford Escape for something more fuel efficient.  I worked with Kim in the Internet Sales division at Baytown Hyundai, and I scored an excellent deal on a new 2016 Hyundai Elantra Limited.  I've never owned a vehicle with that many features, and it was a bit overwhelming at first!  However, the entire staff at Baytown Hyundai made me feel right at home, and the process was seamless.  I'd highly recommend anyone consider stepping just outside of Houston and looking at the inventory they have.  They work with two other lots as well...so if they don't have it, they may have it at one of the other sister dealerships.  However, the other two aren't quite as nice as they are at Baytown! :-)",5.0
