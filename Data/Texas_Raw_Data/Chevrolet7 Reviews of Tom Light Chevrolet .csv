0,"August 16, 2018","The professionalism of this service department is far below par. I took my car in to have the air filter and cabin air filter replaced. It took them over 24 hours to finish the replacements. I was never informed that they would keep my car overnight. To top it off, they charged $50.00 in labor to replace the air filters. 

I would definitely not recommend this service department, nor will I go back. ",1.0
1,"June 25, 2018",We bought a new Camaro in Fort Worth for my son. He lives in college station. He went in to Tom Light to have them put his license plate on and they charged him for it. It is not about the money they charged it is the principle that we should not pay to put a license plate on a car we just bought. No matter where we bought it. I know in my business that I do things for my customers all the time that has nothing to do with what I am building at that moment. All the service adviser (Cole Mullinberg) wanted to do was argue and give examples of why they should not put the plate on. Very disappointing. I know that we will not buy a car from or recommend this dealership. ,1.0
2,"September 29, 2017","I had a great experience at the dealership. The sales representative, Christopher Lewis Terrell, made sure that we were comfortable during the whole car shopping experience, that I had imagined would be a tedious task. We were greeted as soon as we set foot on the premises. Also, Clint Bernard made sure that I knew everything that I was committing my self to, which I enjoyed. Over all the staff was very friendly, patient, and helpful. As of now, they have made sure to keep in touch to make sure everything is running smoothly in regards to the car and also our decision of purchasing the car. I will definitely recommend any Chevrolet vehicle to family and friends but I will also recommend Tom Light Chevrolet in Bryan/College Station to any one I (and make sure they get in touch with Christopher Terrell).

3,"September 22, 2017","Well, things went very smooth on my side. David was great. He did everything to have me a transparent business and I realy appreciated that. I'll be back hopefuly, in the next five years to upgrade and will be looking for David as my salesperson. Jim and everybody were friendly. For such purchase experience, they did not let me to have stress during the deal. They created such friendly environment. I would like to thank to everyone there.",5.0
4,"September 08, 2017","Months ago, we were just looking at options to buy and we formed a relationship with Chris Terrell.  Chris did a great job of keeping us informed of inventory status and current deals at Tom Light Chevrolet without being pushy.  

Once we were ready to buy, Chris had the perfect vehicle picked out and we were signing paperwork a short time later.  There was a slight bit of confusion regarding our trade-in value, but Tom Light Chevy stood by us, ruled in our favor so-to-speak, and earned our business for life.

This is the first time in my 20 years of buying/leasing cars that I've left the dealership without the slightest tinge of regret or buyer's remorse! Thanks!",5.0
5,"January 11, 2017","Don't go to this service department, especially if you are a woman. I was told on the phone that I could have my car brought in to have two service items (a bulletin update and a recall from GM) taken care of in addition to my oil change. I get there and was told there are no service items attached to my car according to the GM system and that I needed a ""required"" fuel flush for a car with 6,000 miles, which coincidentally was not free. I went home and contacted GM directly and was told that the two outstanding bulletins for service were valid and attached to my VIN# and that a fuel flush was not required or even recommended service.",1.5
6,"July 07, 2015","I recently noticed on my 2014 Chevrolet Equinox LT that it's not AWD. All my paperwork States that it is an AWD. I contacted the sales manager at Tom Light, Bubba Dickson which was very rude and unprofessional. He stated that I should have checked the vehicle before leaving the lot. Let me remind you, it's a brand new vehicle and I should not have to do that! But, in there computer system it has AWD. When I asked him to verify that it has AWD in there system and he replied yes and that it was a mistake. I asked him what could be done, he stated nothing and that it was my fault for nothing checking the drive train before leaving. Let's just say the General Attorney's office will be contacting them!",1.4
