He is very knowledgeable and with the finance manager made this one of easiest car buying experiences I've ever had. The facility is clean and they protect themselves and you during the pandemic.

3,"July 26, 2019","Recently I had two Service visits for my sister and used the time to check the showroom for new models. I am very familiar with the Germans , BMW and Mercedes and wanted to learn about the XT4 ,5 and the third row 6. Both Loronzo Davis and Jessie Ledet were very knowledgeable and friendly. They made me feel comfortable on the showroom floor as a mere Service Customer— non spot buyer.

I was impressed with these Cadillac’s after their presentations. These SUVs are on par with MB and BMW on performance and styling. OnStar and in vehicle technology is impressive. 

I took their cards to share with folks in Quail Valley and FT Bend County Community Organizations. 

Great Sales Team at aGreat 5 Star Dealership.

4,"July 26, 2019","I am here in Houston visiting with my sister and family. I am a BMW Sales and FnI manager out of New York metro area. When a Recall Letter was issued on my sisters 2019 XT4 I called Sterling which is closer to her home in Quail Valley than the Originating Dealer , Central. The Service BDC was On It from the moment I mentioned the recall.  They booked us very quickly. The Service Advisor Gonzalo Martinez and his partner Ramon Zapata worked seamlessly when I needed to adjust my pick up date and extend the loaner due to a family medical emergency.    The entire team from the Valets upon arrival to the team at the desk inside led by John were extremely courteous and efficient. DeleH in the loaner department was very helpful and courteous 

Mr Torres is an outstanding Service Manger and Team Leader. Customer focused !

5,"April 04, 2019","After positive dealings with a now-ex-employee, when I tried to purchase my car, about $2,000 in fees were tacked on, which I objected to and were taken off because my face does not have a filter. Then there was nothing offered for my trade-in, so I walked out, and the man I took with me (because few women get fair deals anyway) was asked what it would take. He told them $750, and it was honored. So, I left with a bad taste but not a terrible one. Then I had to call to have my plates mailed because there was a week to go on the temp plates. The salesperson should have mailed them, but he no longer worked there, and apparently mine and many other people's were sitting around waiting to claimed.  

Now, about 8 months later, I've received a registration renewal for my trade-in, meaning that the title, which was mailed to the dealership to the attention of the finance gentleman who was very friendly and helped improve the experience, has not been transferred and no one is answering the phone. I'll keep calling and will hope that under new management these issues will be remedied, ",2.0
6,"October 12, 2018","I drove out of state to purchase a vehicle with this dealership. I worked with a sales agent named Sharon. She was pleasant at first until the I discover they were over charging on title fees over 700 dollars and would not adjust after confirming they were off a lot. Also as a previous review stated they do not include the extended warranty on their CPO. They will charge a extra fee up to $3,000 as a was told. Never heard back from Sharon or David (sales manager) when I confront with the over priced title fees as they listed. I’m sure they riped somebody else off because I never heard from them again. I would advise you look over your purchase agreement carefully!!!",1.0

8,"May 04, 2018","Salesperson was very unprofessional and the dealership charges extra for warranties on Certified Pre-Owned Cadillacs. This is in stark contrast to many, if not most, of the other Cadillac dealerships that include the warranty with their certified cadillacs. This equates to thousands of dollars difference. Also, the Cadillac I drove was dirty, shook at 60 mph, and was definitely not up to certified standards. I did not buy from this dealership, and I never would. Steer clear of this dealership.",1.0
9,"April 20, 2018","after driving 177  miles to buy a premium luxury model cts , when they brought the car out it had the cheapest set of wheels on it that you could possibly get, probably off a base model, so I ended up spending over $1700.00 for a set of painted chrome wheels not even real chrome, and I had asked previously if they had two sets of keys and fobs with the car and the sales lady said oh yes. then after I had paid for the car and was ready to go, I asked for the second set of keys and the saleslady said we cant find them , and the manager said he would not do anything about it, that I would have to buy  another set. after much loud voice raising the saleslady said she would pay for a set and we left for home. two weeks later still no key, I called and she said I have to wait till my next paycheck, but the keys did come about 2 days later and I was told I would have to pay for the cost of programing the fob and cutting the key. I had it done and finally got reimbursed by the gm.",1.8
10,"March 07, 2018",They only care about selling you a new auto.  Not servicing your existing auto.  Have had Escalade in numerous times for multiple issues.  They usually get it on the third try.  Latest issue is they won't honor a warranty for chrome coming off my wheels of a 3 year old auto with $24K miles on it. $80K for an auto that has peeling wheels! Go Figure!  My next auto will be a Ford or a Chevy.  These are overpriced and not worth it.,1.0

""Attitude reflects Leadership!"" resonates Extremely poor customer service and poor service repair all the way to the top, General Manager K. Cooper.",1.4
12,"June 23, 2016","Too many issues wrong with the car before the warranty expired, however, now that the warranty is expired the same issues that was being brought to their attention earlier has gotten worst and they want to charge you these high prices. I have had an engine replaced, on the second transmission within one month of replacing the transmission. They have destroyed my gear, replaced the seat warmers 3 times within two years. Now the car is squeaking badly. Only after changing my transmission did this noise occur. I got a second opinion at this point and I have been told that they did not put a cap on the transmission because there is a hole in it. The dealership claims the hole is normal and that is not causing the noise. All throughout this process they practically was willing to give me a brand new car to trade in the one I bought. I declined it because I will never buy another car that this dealer promotes. ",2.0
13,"April 23, 2016","Let me start by saying my nightmare began when I received a letter in the mail stating that David Taylor Cadillac wanted to purchase my 2013 Cadillac ATS. The letter said they want me to demo any car of my choice and would even pay for me and a guest to dine at any of the Pappas restaurants. As a treat, they would detail my car while it was left there over night and all I had to do was sit through a 20 minute presentation. 

Here's what really happened?

I showed up at the dealership and the sales guy Tim was very cordial until it became clear i was not going to buy a car that day. even after i told them about credit issues i experienced and how i wouldn't qualify for another lease they found it necessary to run my credit anyhow. After being denied said they would go ahead and give me the loaner because the flyer said they had to. I spent 45 minutes the first day at the dealership and when I asked about the gift card they promised, they didn't have any. i left empty handed and went home. the next day when it was time to take the car back, no one even greeted me or acknowledged I was standing in the middle of the showroom waiting for my keys. I finally went to the new car sales manager Walter Thomas and asked about my car. 

Let's pause for a moment and discuss Mr. Thomas. His cavalier yet smug attitude had my jaw to the floor as he told me i was only getting a $25 gift card which should feed two people at Pappas Steakhouse. He turned to me and literally said I should be grateful because 'how often do people give me $25 for food.' I gave him the loaner key and told him this was a joke and he laughed. Not only that, but he made a spectacle by calling 3 others to follow him and make sure I turned in their car. one inspected the inside while the other checked the exterior. like a high school pack of bullies they laughed and walked away without giving me my keys. I called out Mr Thomas for not giving me the keys and he said ""stay there ill go grab them.""

He threw me the keys as he was withing 5 ft of me and laughed about it while he was walking away. i got in the car and not only was my car not detailed as promised, but in worse condition as trash has been put on the floors. the exterior had dirt from the previous rainfall and it was abundantly clear they did absolutely nothing. He walked back as shouted to him from across the lot and stood next to me and my friend and asked me 4 times if the car was clean. finally i asked him what he thought and he said, ""I think you should go enjoy dinner on us.""

I have been a customer at david taylor since 2013 and in spite of a bad experience, i kept returning. This was more than a bad experience. This was outright hostility towards a customer that was going to be a continuous shopper at that dealership. Oh I also forgot to mention I bought tire and rim coverage when I had 4 new tires put on after they misstated the safety conditions of the previous set. An oversight that could have cause great damage to my car, myself, and anyone else on the road that I hit. When asked to verify the coverage he passed the buck to the other departments and said they didn't know. this was a question i asked 24 hours before. If they would have just looked at my car, much less appraise it, they would've seen it definitely needs a new tire and rim. The rim is bent beyond repair and the friction is causing the tire to come apart. Hence I need to get it replaced NOW. 

Sorry for the rant but I am disgusted. So I will take my $25 gift card and have ONE GLASS OF WINE on David Taylor for this garbage. Oh and David Taylor... take me off your list.",1.0

16,"July 18, 2015","I worked with Juan Rodriguez, who works in internet sales for David Taylor. Couldn't have been happier with how great of an experience I had working with him. It was really night-and-day from any car buying experience I had previously had. Found the car (a 2012 Toyota Highlander) through Autotrader.com and setup a time to come see it in person. Juan was polite, had the car ready and up front for my wife and I, and just handed us the keys to take a test drive by ourselves. When I asked to think it over more and come back, Juan just offered for us to take the car for the weekend (for free!), so that we could really get a feel for it and have it checked out if needed. So we did. 

I took the car to a local mechanic and had them look it over. Drove it around quite a bit in different scenarios (highway, traffic, etc.) to see how it handled. And even had original owner's service receipts — so I gave him a call and asked about how he liked it. Everything was positive and honest, so we went back and negotiated with Juan.

Juan wasn't pushy, was willing to work with us on the price, and didn't fight with hours of back-and-forth. In the end, I got the vehicle I wanted, in excellent (near mint) shape, and for nearly $3,500 under the blue book value. Couldn't be happier.

Also gave me a VERY reasonable price on my trade-in, and detailed the vehicle with a multi-point inspection. 

Overall, couldn't be happier and highly recommend both this dealership and dealer. Ask for Juan if you're in the market for a Cadillac or one of their used vehicles — you won't regret it! ",4.8

First off its a beautiful car and Mike was knowledgeable about the vehicle.

19,"April 11, 2015","The car salesman, at the dealership, whose name is, Yousry (George) Salama, was excellent in that he was very professional, knowledgeable, courteous, and attentive. I purchased a certified, pre-owned, 2015-silver, Cadillac ATS-Turbo Sedan and could not be more pleased with the car.

21,"April 09, 2015","After calling BJ Deleon in advance of my interest to test drive a 2015 Cadillac SRX, he had a brand new vehicle in the parking lot waiting for me when I pulled up. I expressed a possibility of trading in my car as well. As I was test driving my vehicle, the dealership was appraising my car. This saved me valuable time! BJ referred me to Robert Buscemi to go over the high tech features of the Cadillac like (Forward Collision Alert, Bluetooth Audio and Phone, OnStar, Driver Alert, NAV, and many other features. Once we knew we wanted this car, Robert drove us to their back lot to pick the color of the exterior and interior. We were surprised by how many cars they had on hand. After selecting the vehicle, then we waited a few minutes to be seen by the finance guy, Micky, it took a whopping 10 minutes to sign the papers and walk out with our brand new Cadillac SRX. Of the many cars the I have purchased in my lifetime, this purchase was the smoothest, time efficient, and without any broken promises. BJ Deleon's team worked together as a team to save us time and money -- that's something I will never forget.",5.0
22,"February 19, 2015","Mike Bowers was a life saver for us. We came into the dealership to sign papers on our new car. Afterward we walked out to take possession when we noticed some damages on the car. The salesman that sold us the car told us it's to late it's your car now (his exact words) we reported him. Then MIKE came to the rescue. To sum it up. THANK YOU MIKE. Your the man.

25,"September 02, 2014","I shared a wonderful experience this past weekend with a wonderful representative of David Taylor Cadillac, salesman Mr. Michael Bowers.  Mike contacted me about a promotional savings being offered on Cadillac's at David Taylor since he knew I had previously been interested in getting back into a Cadillac. I can truly say I was blessed with the desire of my heart.  I walked in only to say what I did not want and Mr. Bowers turned everything into what I did want. He is truly ""Service First"". Thank you Mike for your patience because then I had the greatest blessing of choosing what I wanted for me and not just settling.  I am a very happy and satisfied customer with my 2014 silver 2-door coupe CTS with twilight blue leather and suede fabric inserts seating. Love, love, love it.

32,"August 18, 2013","Bought a 2011 GMC Acadia from this dealer on basis that their service dept would be topnotch. It was good until their recent move to a close by location. The move was premature as mgmt clearly was not prepared to run a service dept at gge new location. I left the car with the dealer for 3 business days to get an oil change and a rattle repair. Despite numerous calls by me to confirm status I never recd a return call. Upon arriving at the dealership to pick up the car I learned that no work whatsoever had been performed on the car. It was clear that no one knew what was going on in service. I was told to take my car to a Chevy or another GMC dealer because no one there knew when the service dept would be functional again. 

What  waste of time!

33,"June 30, 2013","I took my car in to get the GPS fixed and get an oil change/ tire rotation. I brought my car in Wednesday morning. Friday afternoon, I still had not received any call regarding the status of my car. When I called the first time, I was told, ""They are still working on it"" and they couldn't tell me anything more. I asked to be transferred to someone that could tell me and was told, ""Your service person is one of two people; I'm not sure which one"" which was followed by me being transferred to a number that just rang and rang. I called back and was sent to a generic voicemail box. I ended up calling four times before I could get in touch with someone. When I finally did get in touch with my service person, Andrew, he said they were still looking to see if they needed to order a part or if an update would fix the issue and he would call me back in the next 30 minutes. 3.5 hours later I still had not received a phone call so I called back where he told me a part would need to be ordered so I could come get my car and he would notify me when the part was in. Saturday morning, I went to pick up my car where I had to wait 25 minutes from the time a person left to get my car until it arrived and it was filthy. I was asked if I wanted to wait longer and they would wash my car, to which I declined. I was told that the oil change and tire rotation had been done, but when I looked at the cars service menu, it showed that I had 13% oil life, indicating that I paid for an oil change I never received. In all the cars I've owned, I've never had a worse car servicing experience than this one. ",1.3

He made it a great experience for me at David Taylor GMC.

Mr. Masson in Finance was extremely helpful and courteous as well. Even though I did not purchase any of the products that he and his staff offered, he was still as professionally courteous as if I had bought every one of his products.

Second car I have bought from David Taylor and both were excellent. I would not hesitate to buy more cars from this dealer or Nelson.  He even brought to plates to me after Hurricane Ike hit and I had no power.,5.0

57,"July 03, 2006","I just bought a new car here, and family members have bought two other cars from David Taylor (always from Von Wilson), and we've had a great experience each time.  Von - and everyone there - is friendly and helpful, but not at all pushy.  They were very honest and upfront about pricing, options, and availability.  I obviously haven't had to deal with their service department yet, but my family assures me they have always had good experiences.  I definitely recommend David Taylor, and suggest asking for Von!",5.0
