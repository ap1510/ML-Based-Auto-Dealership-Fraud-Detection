15,"March 08, 2020","Volvo West Houston is the most amazing Volvo dealership! I just truly cannot say enough wonderful things about them. We owned a 2012 Volvo XC90. It was a dependable well built SUV. We had no problems with it. We decided to trade it in for another Volvo XC90. The new design the amazing tech ,there dependably and above all Volvo’s commitment to safety. Are the reason why we love Volvo. We purchased a CPO 2017 XC90 t5. I don’t think I would get any other SUV for so many reasons. The customer service is outstanding. Everyone is so helpful and attentive. Adrian Isaacs always goes above and beyond and he should be recognized! The service department shines. Every single employee is so decimated to their job and they run like a well oiled machine. When having some work done on our new CPO Volvo XC90. The service tech explained everything that would be done. On picking it up the same detail of what was done explaining everything!Plus the Volvo was detailed it looked beautiful! There is never any waiting around or wondering what is going on. You are always taken care of. The communication is superb. 
The waiting area is always so clean. There is TV., drinks, snacks, whatever you want. They make you feel so comfortable. 
The dealership is always sparkling clean , even the shop...it’s insane! People are always holding doors open for you, greeting you, making sure you are taken care of, getting stuff out of your car and transferring to the complimentary loaner they provide, which is always nice. 
Thank you Volvo West Houston and Adrian for taking care of my family and  would also thank the GM  Lionel Garcia of Volvo West Houston extremely helpful in getting us the right deal for my family. My wife loves her new Volvo XC90 you’ve made her very happy! 
Thanks, from the Royster family

16,"March 01, 2020","Absolutely the most professional, welcoming, and hands-down positive car-buying experience I have ever had. Everyone at Volvo Cars West Houston made me feel so welcome and I  have to specifically thank both Adrian and Daylan, who made the experience leaps and bounds better than I hoped for. I never thought I would be driving a Volvo again so soon, but Adrian went above and beyond to get me into a safe, reliable, and stellar Volvo that makes me feel so incredibly safe and taken care of each time I get in it. He knew exactly what I was looking for without even having to ask and got me the best deal on the perfect car. I can't thank the staff at this location enough. They truly know what they are doing and look out for the needs of their customers. I absolutely would recommend to anyone looking at purchasing a new vehicle. I am so incredibly happy with my decision and can't recommend this location enough. They are top tier when it comes to customer satisfaction, knowledge, and truly knowing how to connect with their guests and meet their needs. 5/5 stars; I'd rate them higher if I could. Thank you again to everyone at this location for you superior help. ",5.0
17,"February 25, 2020","“Excellent Car Buying Experience”
This was my first experience with Volvo West Houston. BEST car buying experience I have ever had!  Adrian Isaacs was our sales rep and he was fantastic. Only had to deal with one person for the entire purchase. My wife and I purchased a certified ore-owned 2917 Volvo XC90 that was impeccable condition and the price was below market! Adrian was very personable, professional and efficient in processing the sale. I would highly recommend both Adrian and Volvo West Houston for your next car purchase. 
Thanks again, from the Royster family",5.0

84,"May 26, 2019","
I never write reviews but after seeing all the great ones here I felt compelled to share my experience since I unfortunately had such a horrible one. 

I went in wanting to look at the xc90 but was open to look at other vehicles. I walked in and was greeted by the receptionist and was told that a salesman would be with me shortly. After 20 minutes, Daniel finally walks out and offers me no apology for waiting and instead of offering to show me cars he asks me to go to his office. I was confused but I followed and he immediately asks me to run a credit application. 

Now, I have purchased a car before and this was not how my experience with them went. So I was very disappointed that a dealership who is supposed to be so professional and warm and welcoming did not offer me the same as they apparently have many other customers. 

When I told Daniel that I wanted to wait on completing the credit application and wanted to look at the cars first, I could tell he was upset. He told me to look around and to let him know if I saw something I liked. I didn’t understand why I had to go look at the cars by myself. Isn’t the whole point of a having a salesman is to have them help you and show you the cars??

I walked out and had to use the rr so on my way back out, I overheard the finance manager and the general manager talking. He told him some really outrageous things about the customers they had there. The gm started laughing. I seriously couldn’t believe they were talking about their customers like that!!!

I asked someone what their names were and was told it was Daylan and Lionel.

I left and will never return to that dealership, let alone consider actually purchasing a car from them if they still have those type of employees there. Those people care nothing about their customers and are clearly racists.",1.0

This dealership offers a refreshing change-of-pace from the larger corporate-owned dealerships in town.  You could tell the pride-in-ownership: the owner of the dealership was personally on-hand to make sure the operation was going smoothly.  And, talk about customer service - the finance guy even offered to help me review all of my service policies on my Range Rover - that I bought from the competition.  I will definitely be back when I'm ready to purchase my next Volvo!",5.0

100,"January 16, 2019","Their technician staff is the best in the country. They're all master status or higher and I can't imagine another team I'd rather trust my car with. The did the service very quickly, found a few items that needed addressing (which they took car of for free by the way), and have been very helpful dealing with Volvo Corporate with the engine issue I've been happening.  I feel that we will get the best result when everything finishes, but they've done everything they can to help and it shows. A+ job!",5.0

103,"January 09, 2019","This is the second time that I had my car serviced here.
The experience both times was awesome, I needed help resetting my clock not only did they reset the clock but also showed me how to do it.
They inspected my car for state registration, and addressed a problem with the sun roof.
Very pleased with the service department.",5.0

110,"December 04, 2018",My purchase process was one of the easiest I have ever experienced.  Stopped by one evening to test drive the XC60 for comparison to another brand and fell in love with a model that they had in stock.  I provided some information that day and planned to come back the following afternoon to complete the purchase.  When I arrived everything was ready and was only there for 20-30 minutes before going into the financing office.  The most time-consuming thing that I experienced was the delivery process to teach me the features of the new vehicle which was also great. ,5.0
111,"August 07, 2013",I went in for routine service.Gonzalo made sure to ask if I had any specific problems I wanted worked on.He kept me updated while the car was being worked on and made sure the car was washed before  handing me my key. The lady  at the cashiers desk was equally gracious. Thanks  everyone at Volvo of Houston. Keep doing the great job you do.,4.6
112,"July 25, 2013",Purchased my sixth Volvo from Volvo of Houston. I continue to buy from this dealership because of the excellent service . My service advisor Bruce Hall has helped me maintain my cars for 22 years. Patrick Paul is the only mechanic that services my vehicles.

113,"March 04, 2013","I went into the Volvo of Houston dealership on accident, it was the bets accident I have ever had.  I was looking for a different dealership with a specific used car I was looking for, but I found something better and received exceptional customer service from both the salesman Earl Briggs and the used car sales manager David Barrett.  I would HIGHLY recommend this dealership!  I know I am a customer for life.",5.0
114,"August 26, 2010","I was purchasing my very first Volvo in 07/09 and came across Volvo of Houston.  They had the exact model I was interested in (C70), even though I wanted to do Overseas Delivery.  I went in to look at the vehicle and spoke to Jesus, who was very friendly, approachable, non-pushy and informative.  Based on my meeting with Jesus, I decided to go ahead and buy the car, mostly because of how great a salesman he was.  The process was painless (even after negotiating my trade value up from what they wanted to give me).  I have been very satisfied with my dealings at this dealership, both in Sales and Service.  I have been SO pleased, in fact, that I have referred 3 more people to Jesus and Volvo of Houston ('06 V70, '08 XC90, '10 XC30) and I will continue to refer more.  I plan on buying another C70 in the next couple of years and Volvo of Houston is the only dealership I will go to.

Go see Jesus Phillips @ VOH and I doubt you will be disappointed!",5.0
