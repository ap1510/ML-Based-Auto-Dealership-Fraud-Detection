0,"May 13, 2020","This is the second car I’ve bought from Radar. Both times he took the time to explain how things work and also set things up for me. He has sent several videos on how various features work and calls me to check if I understand. My first car from SM was a 2013. Since then, Radar has sent me birthday and Christmas cards every year. 

I think (hope) I paid a fair price and received a fair trade in.",4.8
1,"April 09, 2020", I got burned. I recently purchased a 2014 Pilot with 83k on it. I bought it as is with a promise that if anything major went wrong in a short period of time they would cover the labor and I would supply the parts. Well two weeks and less that 2000 miles later the hydraulic tensioner for the timing belt failed rendering the car unsafe to drive as it has an interference engine and a loose timing belt can cause major engine damage. I called and left messages for the salesman to call back and he never did. I had to call 5 times to get a response. I texted back and forth with the salesman several times and often he wouldn't respond for days if at all. His voicemail was full and I couldn't leave messages. When he finally started communicating with me the responses were slow and worthless. The origional offer of labor was recended. I asked for them to sell me the parts at cost and they agreed. The price they gave me for the parts required to make the repair was more than double what I could purchase them for at other honda dealerships. I just ordered the parts from Honda Parts Now for less than half the price they quoted so I can get this thing back on the road. They should have made it right but did not. I will not be going back and will let everyone I know to stay away as they blatantly lied to me to make a sale then gave me the run around for 3+ weeks when I did have a problem. ,1.0
2,"March 04, 2020","There was an AC issue with our new 2019 Honda Passport, and just getting to Texas for March 1, we knew we didn't want this to ruin our month vacation.
Austin and others in the Service Department quickly got the vehicle in for diagnosis. Once the parts were in stock, the repairs were made quickly and professionally. Being a vehicle purchased in Canada, there could have been issues processing the warranty work - not here!

A big thanks to all that helped get us back to enjoying our time in Texas.",5.0

4,"October 01, 2019",Best car buying experience we have ever had. From first phone call to financing was very easy and no pressure. Would highly recommend considering this dealership whether new or used vehicle. ,5.0
5,"June 27, 2019",I can't say enough good things about this dealership. I live in Schertz but I drive all the way to San Marcos just to buy my vehicles.  My family and I have bought 3 cars from this dealership and we'll buy again when the time comes.  My salesman Radar went out of his way to get me a super deal. ,5.0
6,"May 12, 2019","I give one star only because the salesperson was knowledgeable about the car my wife and I were interested in buying, but the bottom line is that he (and management) ended up being unprofessional.  We were kept there for hours while the managers were deciding if they were going to honor OUR price with a trade-in. We got hungry and told them we were going to go have lunch and they could let us know when they have made a decision. Well, never heard from them. My wife text the salesperson back and was told he was busy but would get back in a few minutes. Never text back. She text him back hours later and told him to just forget it. He text back saying to let him know if there is anything else he can do for us...Really?  They did'nt even have the courtesy to tell us they could not meet our price.  Wasted our whole day messing with them. Went to another dealership and got a better deal!",1.0
7,"February 18, 2019","We bought a preowned Jeep from Honda of San Marcos and found a few items that needed to be taken care of... The items were handled promptly and to our satisfaction.
Thanks to our sales rep Larry Reeves for making the purchase process so easy. Also thanks to service manager Dusty Baker for handling the repair items so promptly. All the dealership staff we came in contact with were friendly and helpful.
When we are ready to replace our CRV, we'll be back to Honda of San Marcos.",4.8
8,"September 29, 2018","My true rating is 0 STARS, BUT the fellow who worked with me was pretty knowledgeable and knows how to tour a car, so +1 star for that.

Typical story. Went in looking for a used civic, and fell in love with a hatch(obviously falling in love was a huge mistake). They gave me the listing price which was actually 1000 more than the listing price that they had online. Told me the best they could do out the door, was a couple hundred more than the listing price they had given me. I left. I thought about going back, but after reviewing their price online I noticed that not only was their listing price at the dealership 1.5k over the fair market range, what they left me at was basically either right above the fair market range or at the very high end of it. Went down the road to another honda and walked out with an BRAND NEW accord for 400 more than what they wanted to screw me out of. Let me reiterate that... BRAND NEW. I left with a better car, in better condition, 7 miles, for $400 more. I can only imagine how they stay in business by fooling poor folks who decide to settle for their scam. Car shopping as it is is hard and stressful enough, don't waste your time here.",2.6
9,"September 12, 2018","After multiple terrible experiences at dealerships in Austin, I checked out Honda of San Marcus after my car was totalled in July. I hadn't planned to be car shopping, having just purchased my dream car two months prior. So, I wasn't excited to be test-driving cars on my now, super-low-budget. And I certainly wasn't in the mood to deal with used-car-salesman-shenanigans. 
That's why, more than ever, to work with someone who seemed to care more about me as a human than me as a potential customer, was a shock, a surprise, and a delight.
Kenneth Curtis showed me what I asked to look at, without ever asking what I do for a living. Kenneth was friendly and laidback. My decision to purchase seemed not to affect how his day would go. Even his manager Adrian was genuinely friendly and un-xxxxxx-y when I left to check out other dealerships. 
I was never called by this dealership during the decision-making process. I was never asked intrusive questions aimed at fueling a sales pitch. I was never rushed or pressured.
I felt valued as a person, whether or not I purchased a vehicle. 
No question, I will return to Honda of San Marcos when I am ready to purchase my next vehicle. Hopefully Kenneth Curtis is still there, because I really appreciated working with him and his team.",5.0
10,"April 17, 2018","We had a great experience buying a new 2018 Honda CR-V from Honda of San Marcos, Tx. 
Don Radar, Salesman, is cordial from the initial telephone conversation and throughout the entire transaction.  Jose Cabello, General Sales Manager, is a helpful communicator and tries very hard to please.  Good, respectful business men. We thank you both and your staff for making our car buying experience great!

11,"August 10, 2017","The folks here are so nice when you visit. I came from a very great distance, lured by the advertised lifetime warranty that only they can give.  My experience was just horrible. The main reason is that they require you to sign what they call a Dispute Resolution Agreement, before they will sell you a car. Problem for me is they never mentioned it until seconds before handing me the key. Why in the world would any dealer require you to limit your rights and surrender your full ability to address problems unless they were planning on screwing you? I wish I had read reviews on this dealer prior to going, it would have saved me a world of hurt. They also charged me 500 dollars for a security deposit that was promised never to be charged unless I backed out of the deal? I paid, signed the stupid agreement under duress, and then they charged me anyway. I had to have my credit card company go and get the money back. The salesman misrepresented what the lifetime warranty covers too. Smells pretty rotten to me? Please take the time to read the many reviews on how this dealership fails on the honoring for the so called lifetime warranty? Now I guess we know why they force the agreement, so you cant attack them for failing to honor the warranty. I have better things to do than deal with dishonest people like this. Stay far far away.",2.3
12,"May 28, 2017","Now I know why the won the President's award - their customer service is outstanding.  Our salesman was Brett Owens.  He was friendly, knowledgeable, and committed.  He introduced me to the general Manager Jose Cabello.  Wow what an awesome guy.  Went above and beyond to ensure that I received the best deal - and it helps that he is very personable.  I left there with a CRV-EX in the color we wanted,  a better deal than I expected, and the best customer service from a car dealership.  Kudos to Honda San Marcos!!!!!!!!",5.0
13,"February 22, 2017","I bought a used CRV from Honda of San Marcos and was pleasantly surprised by how straightforward and friendly everyone I encountered was.  Anna in sales was very accommodating, knowledgeable, and direct with me during the negotiation.  She was extremely nice, and made me feel totally at home during the whole process.  That was very refreshing considering the slimy feeling I usually get from sales people.  Tammy the sales manager called the previous owner to track down the cargo shelf for free, which would have cost me $400 to buy new.  Dusty in service came out to look over the motor with me and was very patient and positive with my questions.  Finally, Adrian in financing was on top of everything and made the payment portion about as pleasant as giving someone thousands of dollars can be.  

This time I drove all the way from Cedar Park to San Marcos because of a particular car, but I'd do it again in the future because of the people.  ",5.0
14,"February 16, 2017","Wish there was an option for zero stars. This dealership does not honor there lifetime warranty like they say they do and won't ever anything covered under warranty. They make excuses and say that you, the car owner did something wrong to cause the problem in the first place, therefore it's not covered under warranty!!!! This happened to not only me but to my friend as well. My 2014 Honda Accord drives really rough as if my shocks are bad and my rear tires keep wearing down and cupping. Only my rear tires keep wearing out and cupping. To me there is totally something wrong with my car but they would not cover my rear tires under warranty since they had prematurely wore out. And my rear shocks they say are fine but that my alignment was off and that prob I had faulty tires as to why my rear tires keep wearing out. So we went to Discount Tire and also Firestone and they both said my alignment was perfect and that the tires were not faulting and that it was the rear of my car causing the back tires to wear out prematurely. So we went back to Honda and showed them the two tire places paperwork and they still didn't want to help me instead they said they would replace all four of our tires and give us a little discount. OMG!! Like really!!! My car is under warranty and also has a Lifetime warranty. My friends 2016 Honda Accord had his engine go out with only 23,000 miles and since the dealer shows a overrev code pop up they don't want to cover his engine under the factory warranty. A engine should not go out that fast. SO PLEASE TOTALLY STAY AWAY FROM HONDA OF SAN MARCOS!!!!!!",1.0

19,"September 25, 2015","I am originally from Houston, so I really ""know"" snobby salespeople!!  You will not find that attitude here!  The sales team is fabulous!  They treat you like you are the star of the sale, not the vehicle!  I have bought 3 cars from Honda of San Marcos and the last 2 from Don Peltier - he is awesome!!   He should write a book on how to be a ""repeat customer"" salesman!!  He is courteous, an excellent listener, wonderful negotiator, you name it, and Don can do it!! He truly cares if you are satisfied, and not for the the acclaim of the sale, but, his concern for his fellow mankind!  He has even helped me with service before - nothing else to say, but, what a breath of fresh air,  buying from Don Peltier and San Marcos Honda!!!     We will see yall soon, for a 4-peat!!!!",5.0
20,"September 22, 2015",I recently bought a Odyssey from San Marcos Honda. David Cook from the dealership did excellent job in closing the sale for me. He is so responsive to questions and patiently clarified all doubts that I had. The buying process was so smooth. They also have life time (non-transferrable) power train warranty that impressed me as compared to the other dealers. David Cook has been checking with me after buying the car. He is also helping me with all my queries after sale was done. Thank you so much San Marcos Honda!,5.0
21,"September 21, 2015","Leasing my daughters Honda Civic was very easy, quick, and professionally done. David Cook explained everything to us about the difference between leasing and buying. Everyone was very polite and kind. I didn't even feel like I was being pressured to buy or lease. David Cook made me feel at ease and confident in my lease purchase. I would recommend San Marcus Honda to all my family and friends for the professionalism, knowledge, and hospitality that was provided. Thank you Mr. David Cook!.   ",5.0
22,"September 21, 2015",I had a great experience working with David at Honda San Marcus.  He quoted me a price on a CR-V that I thought was fair with no add-ons to the price  when I visited the dealership.  He beat all dealers in Austin on price.  I also received a fair price on my trade-in from the dealership with no haggles.  David was very professional in dealing with me with no pressure for up-grades and explained everything in detail.  I would gladly recommend David to my friends and I will be returning to purchase my next car in about a year.,5.0
23,"August 09, 2015","Own a Honda Accord. Came in for Transmission fluid flush, brake flush and fill, and coolant flush and fill that cost $500.00. I thought for sure I received top of the line service. Left the dealership and went down the road to get an oil change. They checked all my fluids and said the transmission fluid was brown! It was either NOT changed or NOT flushed. Now keep in mind that while my car was being worked on I was called and told I had had a transmission leak, needed to change a transmission axle seal ($160) it was leaking. They told me that the transmission holds 6 quarts and they drained 3 quarts and added 3 new!!! They did not flush the dam thing!! The fluid was brown. Then the brake fluid was 1"" above the max line overflowing out onto the engine. My mechanic told me brake fluid is very corrosive to other parts of the engine and rubber. Not only that but the pressure was not properly maintained because it was filled to the top!!!! I will NEVER go back. ",1.2
24,"July 13, 2015","Most car-buying experiences are stressful and long. However they worked with my unique situation and helped me in every way possible. Most importantly after several price checks around the area they were able to be the very best offer. It was a great experience and I recommend friends, family members and anyone else to give them a shot! Thank you!",4.4

I've went to many dealerships before and this one has been the friendliest by a long run. The GM Jose Cabello is one of the greatest guys you'll ever meet and he will definitely make sure you get into the right car at the right price! Not to mention the Free Lifetime warranty for the car!

I've always been a Honda lover and the free lifetime warranty is what sold me every time. Matthew Cabello has been my salesman every time and each time I feel like a million bucks. He is one of the most respectful and genuine salespeople I have ever met. One of the managers there, Jose Cabello, always goes above and beyond to make sure I am well taken care of. As a loyal customer to this dealership I would gladly recommend it to any person in the market for a new or used vehicle!

35,"June 29, 2015","Absolutely the best purchasing experience I have had to date. As a sales professional it is easy to spot someone who is dedicated and fully invested in my best interest when making a purchase and this has truly been my best experience yet.

After shopping around a bit I called into Honda of San Marcos to take a look at their offerings and spoke with Tammy Treigle. The process once I arrived was quick and painless. 

I had one vehicle picked out before arriving and was given a few more options within my budget I could also test drive and consider (love having options). I landed on the Honda Ridgeline and love it! Everyone was extremely helpful and I was very happy with the price moving forward. The paperwork process was quick and easy. Very happy with the quick service here. 

I highly recommend this dealer and asking for Tammy Treigle to anyone in search for a new or used vehicle.

36,"June 29, 2015","I was looking to trade in my 03 Civic for a new 15 Accord Coupe, and after doing a ton of research online, I went to Honda of San Marcos to test-drive and run some numbers since I had been using their service department for the last 6 years and I always like to give my local shops the first chance at earning my business. The salesman that I worked with was Matt Cabello, and with the help of one of their managers, Tammy Treigle, whom I can't compliment enough, they were able to locate the exact color combination that I wanted and even drove to Dallas to get it for me as it was the only one left in the state. When negotiating, I told them what my budget was, how much I wanted for my trade and how much I was willing to spend, and they worked with me every step of the way. When it was all said and done, they got it to me at a great price, one that was fair to both parties, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. Thank you Matt, Tammy, and all at Honda of San Marcos for making my car buying experience as painless as possible! I'll be back for sure.",5.0
37,"June 29, 2015","I have been using Honda of San Marcos as my service center for over 6 years now and would recommend them to ANY Honda owner in the Central Texas area. They are fast, friendly, and will even give you a ride anywhere in town if it's going to take a while. I won't take my Honda anywhere else.",5.0
38,"June 27, 2015","I was in the market for a new Honda, so I shopped several dealerships in central Texas.  Found a car I liked and was ready to purchase at Honda of San Marcos.  *The actual sales reps I worked with were really pleasant, happy to answer all my questions, and were doing all they could in my favor.*

However, things took a turn for the worse when we started to work with the management in the business office - Tammy and Jose.

A) Insisting I purchase add-ons like environmental insurance and tint that I didn't need before finally accepting I wasn't going to purchase things I didn't want to purchase.
B) Trying to convince me that MSRP on a brand new car is a ""really good deal"" and they couldn't negotiate any lower than that. (Maybe they thought I was stupid.) A fair deal should include at least a little off MSRP on a new car.
C) Trying to pass on an inspection fee to me - it's a new car?! (Other dealer informed me that new Honda's carry a 2yr inspection waiver).
D) Had an offer on the table at closing that had to get passed by Business Manager Jose. Called back right after opening next day and was informed that my final offer was rejected and they couldn't even honor their best offer from closing the pervious day (despite it being $500 more than everyone else because they had the color I liked.)
E) Was then told another couple was already trying to purchase the car $1200 over MSRP (+ Tax, Title, License)!! so they would work them moving forward. But, the other couple had poor credit and Jose invited me to make more offers to bid up the price as the other couple waited to get approved.  I wasn't willing to try to buy a car out front under someone over the phone who'd already agreed on price and was sitting in the dealership - just to make a dealer a little more. That isn't a way I want to do business.

In the end, there are several other places to get a much fairer deal and feel better about making a large purchase. Honda of San Marcos really shouldn't be your first stop, unless you want to drop a fair bit of extra $$$ and feel pushed around.",1.0

40,"February 28, 2015","My name is David. I drive my car around 35,000 miles per year for my work. I cannot be without a vehicle. I recently needed service to my Honda Civic Si. So I called Honda of San Marcos and spoke with Dusty Barker who is the Service Manager and he was able to repair my problem before the close of business. What makes this story extra special is he didn't even get to start on my car till 5:15pm. One of the Honda Technicians that everyone calls ""Willy"" stayed to save the day. When people go ""Above and Beyond"" it means something. I""ve always known Honda is a quality product, now here is a ""Quality"" dealership you can count on for Sales and Service. ",5.0
41,"February 23, 2015","I recently took my car in for its annual inspection. During that inspection, several issues were found. One of which was a Timing Belt seal leak.

A year and a half ago my wife and I moved to NC from TX for my job. Before we left I had my car go through Honda's 200,000 mile maintenance and had a Timing belt replaced. For those of you that are not familiar with the replacing of a timing belt, it is not just the belt, but a whole kit including the seals. The total price of the Kit and labor comes out to $900.00.  Even though Honda was more costly than other mechanics in the area, I choose to have the work done through Honda of San Marcos because we trusted the ""Honda certified maintenance"" and also because it was our home dealership. As most of you know, my wife and I are from San Marcos and have very deep roots there. We wanted to make sure that it was done right and that we could rest easy while being away.

Within the last year and a half the car was shipped to NC and has been driven to and from work. The mileage at the time of the Timing Belt replacement was 203,609 miles, the mileage now is 213,610 miles. I have logged a total of 10,000 miles since our move. Timing Belts are meant to last 70,000 miles before recommended replacement. At my rate of driving that would have been 10 years.

I called the dealership in San Marcos to find out what can be done about the faulty seal. According to the Service Manger there, NOTHING can be done. Honda of San Marcos’ policy is 12 month or 12,000 miles warranty on all works. I find that terribly convenient for Honda because most issues that are not of catastrophic nature are only found during maintenance and inspection. I cannot recommend a dealership that does not stand behind its work or parts.

This problem would have not been found if not for the annual 12 month inspection process in NC. We are now out $900.00 that we originally spent with Honda of San Marcos and looking at another $600.00 to have this replaced in NC. ",1.4

43,"January 17, 2015","Our experience at Honda San Marcus was excellent! Don Peltier helped us get the exact car we wanted. He was thorough and very friendly, completely unlike other sales people we've dealt with. This was the only dealership that offered all of the information we wanted up front without us asking for it and followed up with phone calls and emails. Plus the prices were comparable with other Honda dealerships. We never felt that he was hiding anything or trying to get us to pay a higher price. Don was the real reason we chose Honda San Marcus over other dealerships; even though they were a lot closer to where we live.  Ask for Don Peltier when you go Honda San Marcus, you won't be disappointed!

We also can’t thank Teresa in Title/Registration for hanging in there in getting our Disable Vet Plates transferred.   She is very nice, polite, and knows her stuff. No matter how difficult the task she comes through! 
I almost forgot who else offers a Lifetime Powertrain Warranty?

Mr. Ammons even accused me of ""threatening"" his staff when I said I would pursue this legally. For the $1000 or so value, it wasn't worth the time involved for me, since we live 80 miles away from San Marcos.

I am from New Braunfels TX, a medium size town between San Antonio And Austin Texas. I would like to share our Honda purchase experience.
On 8/26/10 my wife and I had the most outstanding experience at Honda San Marcos. Randy Ammons our sales rep. and Rando Ammons the GM are hands down the most down to earth people we ever dealt with at any dealership we have ever done business with. 
Our story started when we were looking to purchase a used car for our daughter. She had surprised us by working hard and making the Dean's List at The University of The Incarnate Word in SA Texas. So we wanted to surprise her with a car. We met Randy Ammons to look at a used car but ultimately with their lifetime power train warranty and prices we couldn't pass up getting her a new Honda Civic Coupe. So we worked out a deal to surprise our daughter and made arrangements come back the next day. She knew we where looking at used cars but had no idea we had found her a New 2010 Honda Civic. 
When we showed up the next day. The car was waiting in the front with new pin striping and tinted windows. It looked better then even the day before. There was even other people looking at it. Randy met us as we parked right next to the car we had pick out. My wife immediately took our daughter over to the car and asked if they could take it for a test drive. My daughter was reluctant because she knew that we were not looking at new cars. Randy reached out with the key and said ""go ahead give a spin, while your dad and I go get the used car from the back"". 
As they went on the test drive I finalized the purchase. It went so smoothly I couldn't believe it. There wasn't even any pressure from Randy or the finance department to get added warranties, bells or whistles. When my wife and daughter walked through the show room floor Randy met them and I followed. Randy told us that Rando the GM wanted to visit with us. We proceeded to Rando's office and shook hands and talked about possibly buying a used car for our daughter. He and Randy played along perfectly. Our daughter proceeded to rant and rave about the 2010 Civic she just test drove. Then Rando said “That specific car has already been sold to a gentleman”. You could see the disappointment in our daughters face. She said ""Oh really, that is my dream car, even the color was perfect"". My wife and I guessed at the color blue and boy did we get lucky. Then I asked Rando ""Who did you end up selling that car to?"" He looked at me an then her and said ""My name."" My daughter looked at him ,then at us and then it clicked! You could see it on her face as she started to shake. ""They just said my dad's name"" and she started to cry hysterically as Randy held up the keys. She was crying we were crying, Randy and Rando even had an alligator tear in their eyes. Boy what a wonder feeling, to be able to reward our daughter who worked so hard on her education. Especially since she had always struggled in school growing up. We truly believe that you should  never give up on your kids. Always support them no matter what, and sooner or later they will grow up and surprise you by turning the person you always believed they could become.

I truly want to say that Randy and Rando Ammons with Honda San Marcos have earned a family of customers FOR LIFE!!! We have two more in high school and we now know we will never go anywhere else but Honda San Marcos. We encourage everyone we know to visit Honda San Marcos. I tell them “You can always try the Rest but don't forget to visit the Best, HONDA SAN MARCOS!!!”

58,"March 24, 2011","We purchased a new Honda Accord Crosstour from Honda San Marcos.  I always dread the new car buying experience, but this was the best experience I've ever had.  The staff was very patient and accomodating with us.  They didn't have the color we wanted, but said they could get it for us in a couple of days.  2 days later our car was in.  When we showed up our car it was detailed and waiting out front for us.  Waleed spent some time getting us familiar with the car and then got us into the finance office to finish up.  We were in and out in no time.  I highly recommend Honda San Marcos.",5.0
59,"March 24, 2011",The service department at Honda San Marcos is exceptional.  There is always a friendly face to greet you and service is done in a timely manner.  I recommend this dealership for sales and service to ANYONE owning a Honda.  Just great people all around!,5.0

61,"March 23, 2011","Arrived for scheduled appointment but no one was at the service drive-up. Waited for 10 minutes as all service reps were nowhere to be seen, except one who was on the phone, then disappeared. Other employees walked by but none offered to help.  Later, after 2-2 1/2 hours of service, my car was pulled up in the service drive, pointed outward. When I walked from the waiting area  (waiting area is quite nice with good chairs and free coffee) I was told I'd be taken care of after another customer. Then after that customer there was a long discussion with someone else. I waited at least 15 minutes for my bill. No one entered the service performed in my Honda book, although I showed it to the service rep on arrival and left it beside the seat where the mechanic could see it. It appears the customer's time is not a priority at San Marcos Honda. I felt like they were doing me a favor to service my car and would get around to me at their convenience, as nothing they did seemed to be at a business pace. Next time, I think I'll see if other area Honda dealers place more value in their customers' time and patronage than I felt at San Marcos Honda. I'd moved from the city where I purchased the car, and at that Honda dealership, customer service was very important.  They operated at a brisk business pace and your time was also their concern, whether you were waiting or being transporting  somewhere. Maybe that dealership spoiled me.",2.0
62,"March 09, 2011","I recently went into honda San Marcos because I have dealt with them before and they did a great job. However, this has not been my new experience. After a less than satisfactory sales experience they finally got the car I wanted in and it didn't have tinted windows as I requested. The sales man then told me it didn't because they were ""trying to keep cost down"", and told me I would have to pay 400.00 for the tint but ""I was better off getting it done somewhere else"". I left. Upon leaving they had a sudden change of heart and said they would do it for free. At this point I was done with them. I have since then went to another dealer and had a great experience. I have been trying to recoup my deposit to no avail. They have been rude and abrasive about this issue. I want my 500.00 back and they refuse to give it to me because they say I signed a handwritten document saying I would buy the car. The general manager Jose Cabello has said he cannot refund it and has no power to do so. My recommendation is don't do business with these people. They are dishonest and have poor business practice. If you are loyal to Honda i understand -as am I. Keep driving on IH-35 and go to Austin or even San Antonio. They cant possibly be worse.  Seems these people are interested in taking customers for anything they can and it doesn't matter how they treat people. Avoid at all costs. ",1.3
63,"December 23, 2010","Worst place to take your car in for oil change or new tires.  Slow, slow,slow. Took an hour for just an oil change. I was the second person here this morning. Only one other person than me. Got there @ 7:35 and didn't leave till almost 10:00. I mean I saw alot of service guys just walking around chit chatting. Horrible Horrible place. Apparently they pay people in the back to sit around. Could of gone to jiffy lube and Discount Tire all in less than sn hour. Will never use there service again:( horrible;(",2.0
64,"September 15, 2010","I bought a Honda for the first time two years ago.  I always take my cars to the dealership for maintenance and someone at work said these folks were good.  The service department promised that I could drop the car off for routine stuff without any appt.  The first time I tried, they scoffed at me.  I tried, per their suggestion, to make appts on line and when I took the car in, they told me that they had no record of these appts.  When I complained, the service guy threatened to ""call the cops"" on me!!!!  This is no lie!!!  I tried to make appts by phone and twice was told that no one was available to make an appt.  What is wrong with these people?  Never again will I set foot on that lot and I will probably never buy another Honda.  Shame is that it seems like a great car so far.",2.0
65,"April 04, 2008","I purchased a new 2006 Honda Odyssey from this dealer and at around 9,500 miles, the rear end of my van began to shimmy violently while driving around 20 mph. The dealer paid to have the van towed to their service department and for me to have a rental car. They made a lot of brake and rear end repairs and shrugged their shoulders saying they couldn't figure out what was wrong, but that maybe I was driving with my emergency brake on. Being naive and trusting that they were the experts and desperately wanting a safe vehicle in which to drive myself and my two children, I paid the $600 and took the van home. One week later, both rear wheels locked up while I was driving around 40 mph and I was barely able to maneuver it into a parking lot. I called the dealer from the spot, they sent an Enterprise rental agent to pick me up and again had the van towed to their service department. This time, they performed quite a lot of replacements and repairs on the rear end and brake parts. One week later, they called to tell me the van was repaired and I could pick it up. This time there was no charge. The service manager said ""I sure hope we fixed it this time!"" I was shocked at this statement as my life was in danger if the wheels locked up again. With no recourse, I accepted the van and drove it 60 miles to test it before I put my children in the van. After 60 miles, I was feeling confident, so I turned around to head back home when all of a sudden, the front right and both rear wheels locked up while I was driving 65 mph on Interstate 35 north of Austin. A witness wrote a statement describing the shocking event and the police report states that the possible cause was defective brakes. This time, Honda of San Marcos was much less interested in helping me. Because it is my belief that the Honda Odyssey is defective, I tried to avoid making a claim to my insurance agency so I paid to have the van towed to the dealer again. I gave them full permission to investigate the cause. Two days after the third incident, I went to see the Service Manager to obtain a full set of their records on my car and when the service manager, Cody Davis, noticed the $600 charge from the first incident, he said ""we never should have charged you that. You have my word that that money will be refunded to you no matter what."" Every week I called to ask when I would receive the refund and Mr. Davis kept putting me off until he finally said I would have to speak to the owner of the dealership, Rando Ammons. Rando Ammons wouldn't accept my phone calls, so I went into the dealership six weeks after the promise was made to see him in person. He refused to see me, saying that he was in a meeting. He wouldn't tell his receptionist when he would meet with me, so I waited outside his office. He came out very angry at me telling me he would not discuss my van with me at all and that I was to leave the premises. I had not raised my voice, had not made any threats, had not acted in any aggressive or rude way, so I told him I would only leave once he made a commitment to return the $600 that Cody Davis had promised. Rando Ammons had one of his salesmen call the police. I waited patiently and silently until the police arrived. They issued me a warning for Criminal Trespassing and escorted me, one on each side of me, through the dealership out to my new car (a Toyota!). The decision on the part of Rando Ammons to evict me from the premises through police force was uncalled for. This is my complaint about Honda of San Marcos. My experiences with American Honda, Inc. regarding my defective van is a whole other story which can be viewed at http://www-odi.nhtsa.dot.gov/complaints/complaintsearch.cfm, complaint number 10191329 (please be sure to view the document search).

66,"January 21, 2007","My son at UT Austin also had  a terrible experience at Honda of San Marcos. They were very friendly at first and allowed my son to test drive the Honda Accord to San Antonio, so that my wife and I can look at it. We told him that it was too expensive and to look elsewhere. When my son drove the car back to San Marcos, the salesman and manager yelled at him for going on a ""joyride"" and depreciating the vehicle. These guys are idiots.
We ended up buying our Honda at Fernandez Honda in San Antonio from Jaime Anteola, the internet manager.",1.0
67,"October 14, 2006","My wife spoke to sales person Alex and then I spoke with Sales Manager Dale to confirm the offer that Alex made on 2007 Honda CRV EX model on Friday Oct 13. Both confirmed the offer of $22,645. On our arrival at the dealership on Sat 14 Oct, Alex the original sales person who had given us the quote, gave an excuse of being busy with another customer. The subsitute sale rep and the Sales manager Dale then refused to honor their initial offer. They outrightly refused to accept that any offer was made. They harrassed me by asking for a written proof. They also challenged my claim that other dealers were offering discounts. When i provided Dale with a printed proof of other better competitive quotes that i had, he tried to poo-poo the other quotes. To further cover up and prevent me from demanding that he stick to his initial offer, Dale tried to sell me a lower end model and then wanted me to buy additional accessories that I did not want. The dealership is very unscrupulous, discourteous and disreputable. They are cheats and cannot be expected to keep their word. They made me drive 45 miles and then went back on what they had committed. I do not think they are a business that can be trusted.",1.0
