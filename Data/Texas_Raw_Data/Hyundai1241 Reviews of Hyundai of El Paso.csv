2,"July 15, 2019","After being told I was approved, being congratulated, signing a whole bunch of paper work and driving home. Salesman calls me and tells me I was never approved and need to return my new car to the dealer. After explaining this entire situation (more details being retained) I still wound up with no car, help, or compensation. 2 times Hyundai of El Paso has wasted my time and effort (any money). Please be cautions and don’t get your hopes up. I will never return.",1.8
3,"July 09, 2019","I drove 4 hours to buy a car here.  And I am SO happy I did.  Jonathan and everyone at Hyundai of El Paso were very friendly even during a busy sale that they had going on.  I honestly did not think I would be going home in a brand new car.  Jonathan was an awesome salesman!  He was very knowledgeable, respectful, friendly, and I could tell he really wanted to help me out.  I'm very happy with my purchase at Hyundai of El Paso and will be coming here for all of my future purchases and highly recommend them.",5.0

6,"January 04, 2019","Email I sent to Hyundai of El Paso: 
I just wanted to advise you that you all lost a valuable customer and I will never take my vehicles to you all again.  My wife took her 2018 Hyundai Elantra Sport for a new tire and was initially quoted $150.00.  I thought that was high due to the fact that Discount Tire has the exact tire for $105.00.  The convenience of your location to my home and being a regular customer I decided to give you all my business.  HUGE mistake, the total jumped to $189.00 the day we decided to get the repair done.  I should've just said NO and taken it elsewhere, but being loyal or stupid I had the work done at that price.  When my wife picked up the car it miraculously jumped to $214.61.  I hope you all are happy with the extra cash you all swindled from me because this will be the last cent you ever get from us.  I purchased two vehicles (2018 Elantra/2015 Tucson) from you all and WAS planning on purchasing one this year for my 16 year old daughter.  Also, I plan on leaving poor reviews on every website that I can find about your shady business practice.  

Response: 
 Hi Eric,
I recently received your online request and I was hoping you could answer a few questions designed to help me to better assist you. Serving our customers' needs is my highest priority, and I want to be sure that I have addressed your request appropriately.
1. Have you purchased from us before?
2. Will you be taking advantage of our finance options or paying cash?
3. Will you be trading in a vehicle?
Please reply back at your earliest convenience.

This pretty much sums it up why I will never do business with these people again!!!!!!!!!!!!",1.0
7,"October 14, 2018",The service has been the worst experience I’ve ever had with any dealership! I have been waiting on my car to be ready for almost 2 months now.

9,"September 29, 2018","Don’t ever think of buying a Hyundai or going to this place.With this price you can even buy a lot better Japanese or American cars.
My car engine that was under warranty got replaced  after 5 months! 
Yes 5 months! The car was unattended under sun exposure for 5 months.
And interestingly the company representative said that it is quite normal to take 5 months to replace an engine on a Hyundai car.Even if they had sent the engine from South Korea with a boat it would have not taken this long.
They also ripped me off as of about 400$ for some very minor paint  that was scratched off the rear bumper as big as of 3 chickpea sizes which was already present on the bumper when i got the loaner car and I disregarded it because I never thought these people will ripp off customers out of even their loaner cars.They had threatened me indirectly through the case manager of Hyundai USA corporation that if I don’t pay that money and don’t return the other loaner car when the engine was replaced after 5 months , they would charge me other fees.
Don’t buy Hyundai snd avoid tbese people!!!",1.0

He broke everything down to where we could understand and gave us our best options. When my husband and I walked in here, it felt so welcoming. We weren’t customers we were friends.

112,"October 27, 2017",I have owned trucks my entire life. I decided to try Hyundai as I had heard good things about them . I don't regret buying an suv however I wished the sales person would of not been so pushy into not allowing me some more time to find a different color or check another vehicle in same price range. I would had appreciated if he would had taken more time in assisting me rather than trying to make a sale.     The vehicle I ended up purchasing was sort  of a blind purchase as it was late and upon inspection after paperwork was signed vehicle   had some scratches and the entire engine compartment was filthy . The door sills were all dirty and I ended up cleaning them myself. Almost felt like I had purchased a rental.

146,"October 03, 2017",Not a pleasant experience with Kwasi. The only reason I purchased the vehicle was because Mr.Lucer stepped in. After the purchase I had a blow out on the right front tire. This was only 3 days after (on tues) and it was like pulling teeth to get it replaced. I went back and forth with Kwasi. He was somewhat helpful at first but when I decided my safety was at question and I went in Wed to get my tire replaced (which he had organised to do on Thursday) he was infuriated. He stayed sending me very unprofessional text messages which I have saved. As I mentioned before he insinuated that I couldn't wait and it was my fault I was not getting whatI wanted. All I WANTED WAS TO FEEL SAFE IN A CAR THAT I HAVE WORKED HARD FOR. My experience with this man left me bitter about purchasing a vehicle.

217,"August 16, 2017","Janet Murray is absolutely amazing, not only is she a very personable lady, she is real. I bought my first car with Hyundai in 2015, she was not my sales person. She went out of her way to make sure that I knew how to link my phone to my bluetooth in my brand new Elantra. Then when my plates arrived she assisted me further and got my car washed and detailed and made sure I left with my spare tire that I had not received previously (keep in mind that she was not the one who sold me my car). I eventually ended up trading in my Elantra, I knew for my new car I wanted no one else to help me but Janet. I came in and the same day traded in my car and gave Janet my numbers that I could work with towards my dream car which is a Sonata. She never asked me or pushed me for more than I could do and made my dream a reality. I will never go with anyone else. I have even referred a friend and beacuse of Janet and her excellant ways my friend now has her dream car as well. Bottom line, if you're looking for a car go see Janet Murray, she will go out of her way to make you happy and help you, I cant thank her enough.

239,"August 02, 2017","I purchased a used vehicle from this company based on the answers from my sales person (Edgar Castillo) provided me when I inquired about the car I was interested in. However, I am now learning that some things Edgar Castillo shared were false. For example, I asked if the service department can check if the trunk was broken. It was slamming down hard and slipping down when up. He said that he asked them and they told him that's how it was. I later went to a specialty dealer and they said that it wasn't normal and it was one of two things: the latch functionality is sticky from corrosion and/or dirt or the cable that leads back to the interior release may be stretched or frayed. They couldn’t tell me for sure unless I paid. He (Edgar) also shared that the XM radio on the car had a lifetime subscription. However, I continue to get notices that it's due for expiration as of today. Lastly, I was told that I would get copies of everything that I signed when I bought the car. That has yet to happen. I've gone to the store twice and called in. After being transferred to my sales agent he said he'd mail me the documents. That was on June 26th. I still haven't received them. Edgar said they'd call me to pick up my plates (at which time they would put them on). That didn’t happen. Fortunately, a lady on the new side saw me struggling to apply my new license plates and offered to help with one, but together we couldn’t figure how to apply the second- (her name was Janet Murray- and she encouraged me to reach out to the Manager after I shared with her some of my negative experiences. She was kind and I walked away from that conversation feeling like if I took her advice the company would help or at least follow up- I was wrong, but I appreciate her effort.) With all of the lies, and lack of follow up I feel that this interaction should be recorded to help others know what I experienced. I would not write this if someone would have just done me the courtesy of calling back and hearing me out. My salesperson that I have reached out to and sold me the car and the false information is Edgar (Squiggy) Castillo. I have reached out and asked a Manager to call me with no success. A man by the name of Jorge Acosta called the week of 8/1/17 saying he received my online inquiry about interest in a car. My interest wasn't in buying another car but getting some answers surrounding the one I recently bought. The second time he called, we were either disconnected or he hung up after I requested speaking to Manager. To date, no one has followed up with me.  This is why people don't trust Sales people and at this point I expect nothing. I'm holding my breath to uncover what else is wrong with the car that Edgar may have not disclosed.",1.8
240,"July 27, 2017",I already had the financing for my new car approved.  All I had to do was pick the vehicle.  I was nervous because I had not bought a new car in a long time.  Things went well and I love my new 2017 Tucson.,5.0

I met him, explained my parameters and I was limited on time. Bottom line, he used my factory rebates as part of the trade-in price and reduced my trade-in value by $2000 which cost me an additional $120 in sales tax and in essence, misrepresented the price differential. I get it and it just might cost your dealership another sale for my wife and future referrals. The cashier could not get my check to clear and that cost an additional 1 1/2 hour.

He took the time to listen to my daughters concerns of safety and comfort in assisting me to purchase a vehicle. He listened to all of my needs and wishes in what I wanted in a new vehicle. He took the extra time to search the inventory to search for the perfect vehicle. At the completion of the sale, Mr. Castillo took the additional time to walk me thoroughly through the maintenance process as I appreciated that he cared enough to want me to feel comfortable coming in for services in the future.

I was told I was going to get a great deal on my trade in and a family circle discount. Well when the time came to make a deal I was offered $10,000 for my car that I paid about $27,000. They said that $10,000 was Blue Book value. Well Blue Book listed it at $17,000 - $15,000 and $12,900 for rough condition. So they offered me less than even rough condition. My car is definitely in very good condition. They insulted me with that kind of offer and by telling me that all cars lose value. Well, No Duh! But not $17,000. After buying 3 Hyundai I did not expect to be treated like that. I am done with Hyundai of El Paso. Buyer Beware your Hyundai vehicle does not and will not hold it's value!!!!!

After being told that I would receive my vehicle after one full day (to repair 2 scratches and one dime sized dent) I received it 3 full days later without having the auto butler or purigen services applied, which was promised. I was then told to bring the vehicle in at my convenience to have this taken care of only to be turned away because I needed an appointment and the services would take 6 hours as opposed to the hour that was promised by the salesperson. In researching the autobutler service  (something that was not explained to me) I realized that it would take much longer so I had an appointment set. Being the first customer in, I was told that I would receive the vehicle the same day (including the single screw that needed replacing as part of a recall) only to be told after checking in that it would need to remain over night. I would not have been upset had I been given a solid timeline as to plan around but the staff in general did not seem to know what was going on. Such a terrible experience. You would think that by committing to buy a vehicle that runs nearly 30k the staff would be more helpful.

We found a vehicle and went through all the credit checks, financing and filled out all the paperwork.  Our credit and everything came back 'excellent.' The dealership was going to be closed the next day so we asked if we could take the car home overnight as other dealerships allow and were told no.  We asked if we could put down a $10,000.00 deposit to ensure the car would be held.  Again, we were told no.  They said there would be no issues, just come back the day the dealership opened and pick it up.  'Trust us.'  The day the dealership opened, we called nice and early to go get the car.  The Manager himself told us fine, the car is ready.  We left immediately. When we got there, the salesman said the car had been sold out from under us.  'Sorry"".  We asked if we could deal on another car, even drove a new one, but all they would do is come off $1,000.00 the price on the new one.  We were so angry!

I decided I was going to buy her a new vehicle as a Christmas gift. And I wanted it to be as special to her as she is to me. My salesman, Frank Zavala made that a reality and found the perfect vehicle for my wife. I let him know that she's long enjoyed Hyundai's Santa Fe's, and he showed me the Sport, 2.0T, Ultimate edition.  It had more features than most of our previous Hyundai's combined.  But he made sure to show me each one of them, and let me test drive them until I felt certain that was the vehicle I was looking for. It's been a few weeks since my purchase, and my wife is still amazed with her brand new Santa Fe. From the navigation, to the panoramic roof, to the heated and cooled seats, to power everything, this is the nicest car she's ever owned. And I was able to get it for her without breaking the bank. The value the new Santa Fe offers is simply unmatched in my book. I looked online at other vehicles, but this was my only stop.

1222,"July 16, 2015","My sales person was Pete, and he did a great job. We had visited several other dealerships before visiting Hyundai and the level of customer service was vastly different. Pete greeted us, took us to the car we wanted to drive, pointed out the features, and did it all without being imposing. Originally, we were looking at the Accent. I didn't like it. Pete suggested the Elantra without being pushy and that's what we ended up taking home. He stayed late, found me the car I wanted (a grey standard), and still made us feel special as we walked out with the keys our of new vehicle. He's great! The following days I came back to the dealership to complete paper work and get my windows tinted and the employees remembered me and congratulated me on my purchase. I felt special. That says a lot.

1240,"October 04, 2011","Hyundai of El Paso is the reason why I will never buy another Hyundai as long as I live in El Paso or the surrounding area.  Their service department is absolutely horrible.  I purchased my 2005 Hyundai Tiburon with 11 miles on it (from my test drive)and it never has passed the TX State inspection.  Hyundai of El Paso would just pass it and told me they had fixed the issue.  Now 6 years later my car will still not pass inspection.  After being told everything from it not having enough gas, to my amplifier causing the failures they refuse to fix it because my warranty is now expired.  They also kept my car for 3 months to fix my sunroof.  They gave me a rental car after fighting for one towards the end of the second month.  I was called at the end of the week to let me know that my car was ready and to turn in my rental.  Once I turned in my rental I got to the dealership and my car was not ready, they just didn't want to pay for my rental anymore.  My Hyundai has been a great car but because of the service depart and ONLY because of the service department I will never buy another Hyundai while I live in this area.",1.6
