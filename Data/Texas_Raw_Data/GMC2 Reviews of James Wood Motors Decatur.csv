1,"September 10, 2015","The dealership is very clean and well kept. However, the service is subpar. The sales team refused to recognize customer needs and were unwilling to accommodate. Had a scheduled appointment to view a vehicle and had to leave work early in order to make the appointment only to find out upon arrival that the vehicle I wanted to purchase had not arrived. No call to let me know and basically no recollection of the appointment at all. The aura reeked of arrogance.",1.0
