0,"November 30, 2012","I absolutely dislike this dealer. I would never buy anything here, nor would I ever let them work on my truck. I dealt with Kevin Lutz the service manager and was treated with severe disrespect. I went above his head, to Tate, the General Manager over the entire dealership and was basically told ""oh well, deal with Kevin."" Obviously they don't need my business or anyone who will listen to me rant. I highly recommend AVOIDING this dealership.",1.0
1,"November 12, 2010","I called and made an appointment to view a late-model Volvo convertible offered by Cecil Motors. The salesman to whom I spoke assured me that the vehicle was on site and he would be happy to show it to me at 9:30 the next morning. A friend and I drive the 22-odd miles to the dealership, arriving at the appointed time only to find that (a) the Volvo has been taken to another site some 75-miles-plus away and that (b) the salesman with whom I had made the appointment was ""not in."" When I inquired about this situation, an employee--who called himself a ""manager""--was impolite, rude, dismissive and offered no explanation whatsoever as to the whereabouts of the car or the salesman.
Needless to say, we left the dealership without further adieu.
I purchased a car the next day from another dealership.",1.0
