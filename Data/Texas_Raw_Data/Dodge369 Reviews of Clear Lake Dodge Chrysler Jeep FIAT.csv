0,"June 15, 2020",Worse buying experience of my life.  Although the service department for warranty work makes it seem a little less bad.  Because it is a whole new level of bad.  If you have to put your car in for warranty work even though it is a brand-new car.  There are no loners.  And just because you have an appointment and a promise of no more than a two day turnaround.  It does not mean anything.  Don't waste your time at this dealership. ,1.0

2,"May 20, 2020","Looks like it’s the same story with this dealership over and over again. Add $5K to the price they advertise for dealer SCAM ONS. And no negotiating here, they don’t care if they don’t sell the car. This dealer will be shut down in a couple of years. Managing staff is pure garbage as well so don’t bother hoping for a good deal. Window tint -$600 , seat protection armor-all $1,700 , drunk alarm BS - $2,500.",1.0
3,"May 01, 2020","I was interested in purchasing a new truck and talked to Keith Davis on a Saturday. Due to me being 230 miles away I put a refundable deposit down to hold it until I could get there with the understanding from Keith that it was refundable if I changed my mind. I asked for a ""front"" sheet showing the numbers and when I got it the price was $5000 more than advertised. $2995 added for appearance protection, theft patrol and window tint! Being curious I go to their reviews. Wow! Terrible!! Then I check the BBB website. They have a D- rating!!! Yeah, NO WAY I'm driving that far to get jerked around. The following Monday I emailed Keith Davis and told him I wasn't buying the truck and that I wanted a refund. He says to call the cashier. So, I call the cashier. Talked to Natalie. She was very polite and apologized but she needed an authorization form from the salesman or approval from a manager. I email Keith Davis again and ask him to take the form to her and let me know when that had been done so I could call her back. Never heard from him. I email him again later and he sends a rude email back and says I DID TALK TO HER AND YOU NEED TO CALL HER. SHE KNOWS TO REFUND YOU THE MONEY. I call Natalie back. Nope, he didn't giver her the form. In fact, she has NEVER talked to Keith Davis about this. Now, being really annoyed I email the Sales Manager Cindy Miranda AND the General Manager Ryan Davis. Nothing back from either one of them. Absolutely horrible customer service from this place. Now I've had to dispute with my credit card. They should be ashamed of the way they do business. Stay away from them.",1.0
4,"April 09, 2020","Some of the worst customer service I've ever experienced!

I verified with the saleswoman, Kendra through email that the vehicle I had been looking at was still in stock. 

Because if the Covid-19 I asked if we could do everything without me having to come into the dealership and risk exposure. 
On the phone she verified that, that was completely ok given the circumstance and that if approved the dealership would deliver the vehicle to me. She knew I lived an hour and a half away, but I asked one more time to be sure that I understand correctly about delivery that far away, I was reassured that, that was the case. 
At that time, after having the email verification, the verbal verification, and the confirmation that it would be able to be delivered to me if I was approved to get the loan. 
I gave permission to be sent a credit application via email. 

I have class A credit and do not just let places run my credit, I was preapproved for the loan. Kendra then text me saying that I was pre approved and that the bank was requesting a few documents and asking when I would have time to stop by with those documents and test drive the vehicle. That was at 5:30pm, she said she was working till 8 that night. 

I responded to her text saying I could send documentation through email that I was not wanting to come into the dealership because of risk of exposure to the coronavirus. She never responded to my two text... I called more than once and left one voicemail. 

After almost two hours of no reply on her part I tried to reach the finance department myself and had no luck at getting anyone to answer. I then asked if the receptionist could page kendra or if I could possibly speak with another sales person and she told me that they had went home for the day, but she could transfer me to a sales manager, Daniel. 

I spoke with Daniel about the car, he had no idea which vehicle I was talking about, but seen my preapproval. He said the vehicle wasn't showing up on the website but he was sending someone out into the lot to verify if they still had it and he would call me back... I never heard back from him. 

Fast forward to the next morning.

A call was put in complaining about the experience and was told they would ""investigate it"" and get back to me.

No follow up call was ever received. 
So yet another call was put in, sales manager, Daniel apologized that ""she didn't know they were working a deal with someone at the time, and that as we spoke it was being test driven."" 

So twenty-two hours after my preapproval email was received, the vehicle was just being test driven by someone else?! 

I was not mad that the vehicle was not available, I was mad that I was told it was and gave permission under false promises that is was available. Only to find out that the dealership actually did still have possession of the vehicle the whole time I was told that it has been sold. 

This is where I lost my cool, I told Daniel that I don't make mistakes where my money is concerned, I researched vehicles for weeks, I verified more than once with the saleswoman, I had a paper trail and I expected them to find me the same vehicle since they had promised me the vehicle and and is now selling it to someone else. 

Daniel hung up on me. 

The GM then called and said
""everyone runs their credit and a preapproval doesn't mean anything"",
""a paper trail doesn't change anything"", ""they don't have to find me a car"" 

1) No. Not everyone does run their credit.
I work very hard to keep my credit score where it is. 
2) A paper trail stands up in court and absolutely changes everything, word of mouth is futile, but a paper trail is solid. 
3) No, they absolutely do not HAVE to find me a car, but being in the service industry customer's are (or should be) you main focus. 

I never demanded anything absurd, I asked for them to find me a similar car. 

Which would have still been a sale. Which would have still been commission. 
Even though I had been shown that the customer service proved to be terrible by that point, I didn't want the hits on my credit to be futile. That shows how seriously I take my credit score!

5,"March 03, 2020",Went to buy a used car and finance refused to take off OPTIONAL maintenance add-ons.  I even had my own financing already and this was one of the worst car buying experiences.  Very sketchy and unprofessional  for a large dealership.  I walked out and did not regret it.,1.0
6,"February 21, 2020","I have had nothing but problems with my Ram for 5 years since I bought it, something I wouldn’t expect from a $40k truck. Every single time I’ve taken it to the service department, it has “magically” never been covered under the upgraded warranty I bought. The last time I brought it in, they quoted me an exorbitant amount to fix the brakes and when I tried to get my truck back, they stated it wasn’t safe to drive. The tow truck I had to purchase and kwik kar I took it to both stated the truck could have been driven safely. This place was trying to jack up the price I would have to pay so I would pay their insane high price gouge.",1.0

10,"November 13, 2019",We bought a used Grand Cherokee for my daughter. Just like the other reviews they had 3k in dealer add ons when the final numbers came back. Was able to negotiate those off. Returned a couple of days later to purchase and the girl we were dealing with was out sick so no one was eager to help knowing they were not getting commission. 3.5 hours to do paperwork and prep vehicle. When they brought the keys there was only one key fob. I asked and was told it only came with one. Said I could talk to the manager. Manager said sorry but could give a new one at cost for $300. Checked online can buy 2 and get programmed all for $120. Not happy at all.,1.2
11,"September 26, 2019","If you care about your time, never stop by there! If I could give them zero star as they deserve zero, I would do. The worst experience in a dealership.
1- First of all the advertised prices are a complete lie. You should pay at least $7,000 more before tax/title than their online price. 
2- They just want to get the customer in. Even if you call them or chat them they say they have the car available for the advertised online price, but having  80 miles round trip to just hear they do not have it available, is really annoying and waste of time. You will hear flimsy excuse that we sold it last night and it has not been entered to the system yet.
3- They will definitely charge you $3,000-$4,000 for just Dealer add ons for just paint coating and some useless stuff.
4- $50.00 gift card for test drive is a complete lie. They accept your paperwork but do not proceed on it.",1.0
12,"September 14, 2019","Honestly the worst car buying experience to date! Do not buy from here!!! Emailed Zack to verify price of the vehicle and he sent us a price sheet which matched the online price. Drove over an hour to buy the vehicle only to be presented with numbers that were 4K higher than the original price plus 3K of add ons that they supposedly put on the Jeep Wrangler which were not on the price sheet. After asking the sales manager (the man with braces) multiple times, he admitted that they don’t actually add any of those things on (scam)! He finally agreed to remove the add ons to the buyers sheet and that they would just absorbed the cost of the items, but he still was 4k higher on the car than the quoted emailed price that I came in on. He  told us he was going to go back to his office and a few moments later the salesman comes out with our car keys to our car and says “sorry, we can’t honor the price we originally quoted you”. And just stood there until we got up and left. Wasted three hours of our time. Multiple people left as we were sitting there because of the same tactics. I hope this post prevents someone else from wasting their time at this crooked dealership. I will be reporting this dealership to the better business bureau and the attorney generals office.",1.0
13,"September 13, 2019","If I could give no stars I most definitely would.One of the worst experiences I've ever had at a dealership! First of all the advertised prices are a complete lie.  I inquired about purchasing a Ram for my husband that was listed at $31K.  Once they ""crunched numbers""the price of the truck came to $41K.  If you are not willing to sell a vehicle for a price you have listed than you shouldn't lie about the price just to get customers to come in. They wanted me to pay an additional $3k for dealer add ons (interior protection) AKA scotch guard that you can buy from any auto store or Walmart for under $10.00.  They also stated that because of the rebates they were losing money on the car.  Newsflash to those who may not know but dealerships get reimbursed for rebates so regardless of if they advertise a dollar amount in ""bonus cash"" the dealership will get paid for that from the manufacturer.  On top of the shady sales tactics the communication skills they have are horrible.  They hardly ever answer calls, texts, or emails.  My Sales Associate Savannah once told me she would call me back in 10 minutes.  36 hours later I still had not heard a peep.  And the management is of no assistance.  I tried reaching out to the GM Ryan Davis and sales manager Kenny Young just to see if I could get an associate that was not as busy and could return my calls but neither of them returned my messages.  I was willing to drive almost 4 hours for what I thought was going to be a great deal but let me save everyone some time.  DO NOT GO HERE!!! Save yourself the time and headache because they may advertise lower pricing but its just a ploy to get you in the door.  ",1.0
14,"July 16, 2019","when my husband and I went in, they didn’t want to negotiate whatsoever on the MRSP price (it’s a price they are able to fluctuate). so we had went to another dealership and then they tried to beat that price the other dealership was giving us so we could go back. over the phone they had told my husband a monthly and a walk out price which we were good with once we got there they switched up the deal yes the walkout price stayed the same yet the monthly price went up about $200 from what we were told on the phone. needless to say we will NEVER recommend this dealership to anyone or will we be back. we have never dealt with a dealership that wasn’t wanting to sell a vehicle. talk about a bunch of manipulating salesmen.",1.0
15,"July 15, 2019","Two years ago Clear Lake Dodge had to replace the cam in my 2012 SRT8 Yellowjacket. It was warranty work. They replaced the cam because of a defective lifter. I asked if they replaced all lifters with the new cam & they said no, only one lifter was replaced. The other lifters & cam were still good & pictures were sent to Dodge engineers. They lied because this engine has only one cam. Their own service manual states that if cam is replaced all lifters must be replaced. Now, 18,000 miles later cam is bad again & I’m told I need a new engine at 70,000 miles. Of course this isn't covered by warranty. The car has a trade in of $20,000 & they want $10,000 for a motor replacement. & good luck contacting them, they won’t answer the phone once they have your car.

Dealer says “no problem” after about 15 minutes he comes back with a quote, $14,000!!!!!! How did a price jump $4,000? I know there’s tax and title but WTH?

18,"May 02, 2019","Purchase 2017 used vehicle from this dealer. Was advertised on Car-Grus. Made an offer which they accepted. I wasn't happy about so called dealer installed options but accepted any way. They claimed vehicle would be ready on 7 Mar. I advised them I'd pickup on 8 Mar and to have everything ready to go as I was coming from Louisiana. Arrived on 8 Mar to pickup and complete paper work. When I arrived nothing was done on paper work and so called dealer options where never done. Three hours of jerk around they claimed everything was done. I paid down payment and signed paper work to include full balance transfer of vehicle cost from my credit union. On 12 Mar my credit union sent them a check for balance of vehicle. They were paid for TX taxes as well as tag and title transfer fees and Louisiana taxes and title tags. In addition to dealer doc fees. After getting vehicle I find none of so called dealer installed options were never done ( $1180 cost). They have never made that good even though I've contacted them many times,. Here it is 2 May and nothing has been done about tag and title transfers and TXDMV says no action was ever done, temp tags run out 8 May. I havw filed with TXDMV complaints and still no action. TXDMV tells me I should never have been charged TX sales tax and should have exemption filed as LA tax and titling was to be processed. At this point I'm left with vehicle with no tags on 8 May and no paper work to transfer and title in TX or LA. . Multiple contacts with dealership get no response. I'm left with filing civil and criminal charges against this dealer for ripping me off for excess charges and fees on this vehicle. Vehicle is fine but padded costs and fees are just there to jack up your costs and inflate overall bill. They will take your money and never carry thru with what they promise.",1.2

He was so quick to take our money but never had the decency to call either of us back! It took showing up in person 3 times to get our money back!!! It turns out we have 4 free oil changes.

23,"February 26, 2019",I have been to a lot of different dealerships in several states burning my travels and this is by far one of the worst! Went in for routine maintence (oil change) and it took hours with an appointment and they did not use the oil I requested ( full synthetic)also didn’t reset after oil change so it shows only 17% life left on oil. Did they even change it???  when I complained the service director blamed it on rookie mechanics because she had fired a bunch of people recently so she has a lot of new people. This does not make it ok. Make sure your employees are trained correctly before you let them work on customers cars and also what “rookie” mechanic can’t do a simple oil change correctly? She said it’s going to get better so please come back..... no chance in xxxx they’ll work on my car again. ,1.0

38,"May 25, 2018","Where to start..... I was so excited to be able to order a new Dodge Demon from Clear Lake Dodge in Webster Texas; unfortunately the entire process after taking my deposit was a terrible experience. It all started with the salesman (Mark Harder) making promises he could not keep and not communicating with me. I was promised to have the car by the first week of January and it did not arrive until April, I understand that delays in production are out of Mark’s control but keeping the customer updated should have happened. Every time I would call Mark for an update he could not give me any information and each time called me back thinking I was another customer he sold a Demon too and giving me wrong information. I would call or text Mark and it would then take days to get a response. I asked for a buyers order and it took weeks of continually asking to finally receive it. When the car arrived at Clear Lake Dodge I tried to get wiring information to pay for the car, this took another two days of calling and texting Mark and when I did finally get the wiring information Mark sent me a picture of a routing number written on a business card taped to someone's desk, so I immediately went to the bank and wired the money......... 3 hours later Mark calls to tell me they had given me the wrong account and said I needed to go back to the bank and re send the money to a different account that was also hand written on a piece of paper. After calling the Finance department they were able to transfer the money from the FIAT account they had sent me first over to the Dodge account. After that was finished, part of the deal when buying the car was to tint the windows, I asked Mark several times to confirm they would tint the windows 20% all the way around and he confirmed via text that would be no problem since car was going out of state........ Mark sent me pictures after they had been tinted and the car was not correct, they had tinted the front windows at 35% and he then told me they could not do what he had promised........ If he would have communicated with me I would not have had them tinted there, so now I have to pay an additional $250 dollars to have the tint they installed removed and new tint re-applied. When I spoke with Miguel Perez (New Car Director) about this and looking for some assistance he told me there was NO way I was getting any help with this and I was lucky I was even getting the car because they could sell it for more than what they sold it to me for! OK, so I drive 2500 miles from Seattle to pick up the car and I talked to Mark letting him know I would be there in about an hour, he said that the car was dirty and he had asked if I want it washed?...... I asked him to please wash the car and I would see him soon. I arrived at the dealership and was getting my enclosed trailer ready to put the car in and here comes a detail employee in my brand new $100,000 car........ he drives right past me, out the front gate and then proceeds to do a burn out and drive off at a high rate of speed. I went in and talked to the sales manager and he apologized for what had happened. I was told the detailer went out and drove the car to get water off of it (whatever). I then meet the salesman (Mark) at the car and he doesn't show me anything about the car and how it works, the interior floor is dirty and the exterior is still dirty in areas. To top it all off, I purchased the car with 2 miles on it, when I picked up the car it had 13 miles on it???? How many other joy rides had my new car been on?? I now have the car home and I am going thru all the stuff in the trunk, Mark had told me they put the locking wheel locks in the trunk that were part of the deal……. NO locks just the car cover, front license plate bracket and battery charger I paid for on the MSRP? The PDI of the car was not even complete as Clear Lake Dodge did not even install the factory pedal covers and just left them in the trunk.

40,"March 29, 2018","I bought a new Jeep Renegade in February 2016 from them.  I had credit challenges then and the finance department was willing to work with me on that.   My final invoice was approximately 3K more than I thought, but I needed a car, and like I said, credit challenges.  I gave up on the overpriced floor mats that were on the invoice that I NEVER received.  It was a full time job trying to get those, so I quit.  The true reason that they are terrible is the service department.  They are just plain awful.  I usually end up with a new bump or scrape on my car when it is left there.  This was true for my first oil change there when  my car was new.   If anything is wrong more than an oil change, expect to leave your car 2-3 days, with no loaner car.  If you are lucky, they may find the problem.  In the two years that I have had my  Renegade, there have been two major service issues.

Even for something as simple as getting nitrogen in the tire, there is a wait because NO ONE wants to work.  The service ""manager"" asks someone to refill tire....that person goes outside and begins texting on their phone...and asks someone else to do it.  Repeat this 2-3 times until someone takes pity on you and actually does the work.  Also, don't complain because your car will have an extra ding when you get it back.",1.4

Not one time in the warranty period has this dealer done ANYTHING with this vehicle. Not one thing. Not worth the drive, aggravation and frustration.
Three free oil changes? Good luck with that. I've had to have the oil changed at my own expense every single time.

43,"February 27, 2018","First off they need to get some real sales people that work and care for the customers! Don't do it!!! This place is a joke, no return phone calls, no honesty, and not worth an ounce of time we spent there all 3 days. Went down the street and was approved in 20 minutes and out the door with what we wanted in under 2 hours!! I wish I could have gave them NO stars!!",1.0
44,"January 23, 2018","HORRIBLE!!! Don’t waste your time here!! The time of sale was bitter, I should have walked away. Jeeps sell themselves apparently because the salesman(Mark)  did NOTHING. I wanted a Jeep Cherokee so bad so I went ahead with the purchase. Don’t bother negotiating because they’ll hide the cost in the contract at time of signing. So, you’re probably thinking that’s the worst if it- it’s not. Service after sale is worse!!! You walk in and have to wait till it’s convenient for the service advisor to greet and assist you. First time having my Jeep Cherokee serviced, I noticed a dent with yellow paint on the side, I didn’t pay any mind to it BUT I did learn to inspect my vehicle before and after every service from them. About a week ago I had my Jeep “serviced”, before I walked in to get helped, I noticed my front wheel cover had the slightest chip in it and so I took a picture of it and marked the tire. When I went home it was dark so I glanced at my vehicle the next morning and noticed my rear wheel cover was cracked severely and my front wheel cover remained the same and still had my hidden mark, MEANING - my tire rotation, that I paid for was not completed! I called Laura in the service department who was eager to help me at first but never called or texted me back to rectify the issue. She simply provided her managers name (Dorena Boyd)  and said she’ll need to review the cameras to make sure the crack on my rear wheel cover happened there- NEVEr heard back. She rejected my phone calls and texts. I tried calling Dorena, her manager and the phone rings and rings and you get transferred from phone to phone with no Dorena on the other line. Now, I’m wondering if my oil changes were ever changed! Look around for a Jeep dealership with good ratings and you’ll discover none exist. Clear lake dodge does not care about their customers, they only care about their “surveys” that they beg you to fill out and beg you for good ratings!",1.0

48,"November 15, 2017","I booked an appointment for an oil change at 9:00 and was told at the time of booking that this would be the best time of day to be in and out quickly.  I arrived before 9:00 and was told about the cleaning, oil change, and tire rotation special and agreed to make that purchase.  I also was told about a recall on my airbag and was told to go to the waiting room while Laura checked to see how long it would take, promising to check in with me very soon.  45 minutes later, I asked for the information on finish time and was ignored.  At 10:30, I again followed up with Laura to get an answer and was told that they were just starting the oil change and then would do the other services, promising that it would only be 30 minutes more, including the air bag change.  3 hours into my appointment time, she made another promise on wait time, stating that the vehicle had been partially finished and would only be a few minutes more.  The manager then appeared to walk me out to the vehicle to show me what was taking so long, and really didn’t care that they were wasting my day.  I was promised the vehicle would be complete in 20 minutes, however, 47 minutes later I was handed my keys without a word.  During my wait, I watched the wait room fill and empty 3 times.  3 hours and 47 minutes for an oil change appointment, and I found that in the process of not actually washing or vacuuming my vehicle, that they had removed a part from my jeep and left it sitting in the center console, scratched my navigation, a cd, and my door in two places.  My fluids weren’t filled and I still have a low tire, I have no paperwork showing that they inspected the vehicle, and I have absolutely no faith that they actually replaced the airbag.  The service was horrid and the wait time is ridiculous considering that there are other dealerships that can, and have, completed the work in well under 45 minutes.  I will NEVER return to this location for service or purchasing my 3rd jeep.  ",1.0

Next I gave them a copy of the Service Bulletin when I turned in my car so I knew how long it would take never got a time frame from them when they would be done. Only the diagnosis which the service rep told me it would take 5 -7 days. Which I found out later was code for we wont touch your car until the 7th day after you drop it off ""With a scheduled appointment"". Every time I asked for a update which was only once a week I get attitude like why am I boring them asking all these questions. I came into the place 2 days before the storm hit asking if I was going to get my car, which I guess was a stupid questions how they made me feel. Why would I want a update on my car with a major storm coming in 2 days. Was told they were working on my radio it was a bad Amp, lol yeah I know later found out that was a lie. After they was closed for 10 days for the storm. Nicely again asked them just to communicate with me once a week with a update, didn't happen. I again had to contact them to just get a update on when I would get my car. Which I never got until the end when they told me it would be ready on Monday which turned into Wed. of course. Which they never touched my radio the whole time. When I came to get the car did anyone come to me and say ""Sorry Mr"" for having your car all this time. Nothing just get your car at the cashier and have a nice day. Any business knows that things happen that you cant control that affect your customers the right thing to do is try to make it up best you can or say you are sorry ""IN PERSON"" with a hand shake and ask for them to give you another try in the future. But I guess I am old fashion. This is the worst dealership service department I have ever gone too. I have lived in 3 countries and over 6 states the worst I wont even drive by this place again. Total they had my car 33 Calendar days and 29 working days with me taking off 10 days for the hurricane they where closed to do 5 hrs worth of work in the end. Unacceptable for anyone.

I walked into the dealership told them I used true car and was looking for xyz vehicle and needed an out the door no bs price. I told them I am not going to haggle I want your best price right now or I am walking. The sales person must have thought I was a fool. He brings me back an invoice for 8k over sticker. After looking at it they had 1800 in dealer add-ons. 395 for nitrogen filled tires, really are you stupid a regular tire shop will do that for 20 bucks. xxxx liquid nitrogen is $250 liquid ton. 400 bucks for tint, ugh it leaves the xxxx factory they way. 400 for wheel locks, really cause I can get a set for every lug for 120. No reduction in price but let's add right on top of msrp. 

This was after the hurricane and we needed a vehicle fast. They tried to take advantage of the situation. 

Later their true car rep called and asked how our shopping was going. I told him of the horrible experience. He said I should have came to him and it would have been different. Well why don't you treat all of your customers the same!!!!!!!

He told me I was ruining everyone there's livelihood and I was also told that they don't sit on the phone. I am even more speechless than before. The only reason I have been to the dealership is to pick up my vehicle or a part that was supposed to be ready, but was not. They do not respect anyone.

I used to own a restaurant in Pearland Tx. and I would love to have people of their caliber working in my organization.

106,"January 12, 2017","I read a review that stated Jeff Kuithe is an idiot.  I have to fully disagree as I now believe he is the antithesis of that.  I took my car in again (it is 5 years old) for a recall to reprogram something.  A friend of mine that is an 18 wheeler mechanic told me that what they were going to do would take about 30 to 60 minutes to complete.  After making the appointment I was told they would need the car for 1 or  2 days.  I remade the appointment for when I was off work on a Monday and Tuesday.  When I got there for my prescheduled 8am appointment I was told this could take 3 or 4 days.  I said I would like to talk to Jeff.  The service adviser told me he doesn't get there until 9 or 10 O'clock.   The car got checked in and I waited for my ride.  I never discussed a loaner car and they never suggested one so I cannot speak to the status of that.  I would not have been able to return a loner car until Saturday so I assumed that would cost me more money than necessary.  As my ride got there at 9:20 to pick me up I realized there was something in my car I needed.  I felt bad about that as they did ask me if I got everything out of my car.  I was taken back to my car which was in the parking lot to retrieve  my items.  Jeff was still not there.  My car was ready the following day except there was a brake light out that I had ask them to replace.   It was not done.  At around noon or so I ask to speak to Jeff and was told he goes to lunch from 11:30 to 12:30 daily.  I was going to ask Jeff why I had an 8am appointment to have my car parked in the lot.  I could have done that myself without an appointment.  Now, either Jeff is a genius for keeping his job or he simply doesn't exist and the place runs itself.  I have written a previous unfavorable review as their service is consistently horrible.  They have never gotten it right for me.  I actually think I would have been disappointed at this time with quality service from them.  I tried to call Jeff and never got a return call (does he exist?). I also called another number (Sophie or something) and never got a return call.  The car is fine and the sales person was good.  I don't take much stock in that as they are sales people.  They have the gift of gab.  If you buy a car from them beware of the service department and if you see Jeff call me.  ",1.8

110,"December 21, 2016",Took my truck here for a second opinion because the previous dealership down the road didn't seem to honest with the $600 quote they gave my wife just to fix a window motor. My wife took it to Clear Lake Dodge and spoke to a Michelle in service. She explained the situation to Michelle and my concerns for the outrageous amount and Michelle assured her the $600 was way out of line. She took great care of my vehicle and wallet and also through in a complimentary tire rotation just for safety. This will be my goto dealership from now on especially knowing Michelle took great care of my wife rather than a know it all service guy who thought he could get one over on a woman. ,5.0
111,"December 21, 2016","While waiting for the car to be brought up I overheard another salesman tell a customer the car they called about was sold at auction, but they had another one.  It took 30 minutes for the car I called about and I was told it was not clean and ready.  What an understatement!   Tires were worn out and the car was filthy!  I told them I was coming from 40 miles away 5 hours previous.  We left before he had a chance to offer another car.  This is a con called the bait and switch.  It is unconscionable that this is their method of operation to mislead their customers.  I will be telling everyone I know not to do business with them.  After checking their reviews I saw many others had the same experience.

Alter telling them that this price was not what I sow they made and adjustment and just increase around 400 usd. What annoyed me was the fact that they were not so clear since the beginning. 

When I looked my time to understand that my car hasn't warranty and make my math to see if I could buy the extended warranty, the representative was rude. AS if he where making me a huge favor! 

Also. The day I bought the car I had a rent a car with me. I asked the sales representative (Harold Fields) if was possible help me returning the car. He said yes, that they will drop up my rent a car that day (Saturday November 19,2016) as I requested. But, when I saw a huge amount in my credit card, I noticed for my surprise that, instead of returning the car on Saturday, they returned it on Monday. So instead of having a charge of 1 day I had 3 days charged !!!!

120,"November 16, 2016","AWFUL experience, not once but THREE times in a row.  Business must be really good for them because the service rep was rude and condescending all three times.  This is what happened; called the first time to schedule a service for a recall item. The service dept scheduled a day and time and when I went they told me that they do not have the parts and that the service person who scheduled the appointment should have known that.  They disdainfully told me to call back in 3 months that I may then be lucky and may have the recall part for me.  So I called 3 months later and managed to schedule another appointment. I asked if they have the parts, the lady disappeared for 5 minutes to allegedly check and came back to tell me that they have it.  So I went again and when I got there they told me I can wait for the service to be completed.  So I waited for about an hour before the service person came back to tell me that they basically forgot about me and that I need to call back at a later time to reschedule.  So I did (I really shouldn't) just in case it was just pure bad luck.  When I called, I asked the lady on the phone if they have the parts, she said they did.  She said I can wait for it to be serviced and that it will only take 30 minutes. When I got there, this service lady kept me waiting 15 minutes before she talked to me and only to tell me that I need to leave the car overnight (which I was not prepared to leave as I had no alternate transportation).  When I told her what has happened these past 3 times, she shrug her shoulders and told me that I need to call back and reschedule again (a fourth time).  So I left NEVER to return to this dealership.  I called Ron Carter Chrysler Dodge today and the service person was polite, scheduled me for the same day and took care of my car in minutes.  AVOID CLEAR LAKE DODGE or go there at your own risk.

By the way, I have bought 2 cars from them in the past and they still didn't care.

121,"November 15, 2016","As I said in my title, please take the time to read this, I know it's wordy but this is important. I keep seeing good reviews for this dealership, but my visit was horrendous. There are a multitude of complaints that I have. Firstly, the service was excruciatingly slow and drawn out. Second, I was looking to buy an F-250 from this lot that looked promising online, and we were assured that the truck had been checked and serviced mechanically by the dealership, but we never buy used without making sure that we are able to have it checked by a mechanic whom we trust. However, when we got the truck home there was no need to even take it to the mechanic because upon a very quick, surface level, self-inspection, there were plenty of problems with the truck. First were the leaks, 20 minutes after getting it home there was a puddle of oil underneath the truck which is already a huge issue. Second, the radiator coolant was leaking which is an even bigger issue. This is completely unacceptable after being told that the truck is in perfect condition. If I was not told this then I would not be so hostile towards this dealership. I'm not sure if they put a quick fix on the truck to make it run decently for a little while, but after we got it home, it could not run for 10 minutes without the check engine temperature light coming on which could be from the coolant leak, or could be a sign of problems with the EGR valve which costs $2500 to fix or delete. The leaf springs in the back are loose and squeak and the truck is completely rusted, I'm assuming because of being near saltwater its whole life. On top of all of this, the internet price was $18,098 which is fair for an 05 F-250 that is in perfect condition, but then when the prices were drawn up an extra $1,800 was added on because the truck ""had a tint and wheel locks"". To start, a tint of this caliber would cost $200 and wheel locks come with aftermarket rims for free, not to mention they add nothing to the value and the tint was messed up on the back right window. When I said I would not pay that amount extra, the salesman was quick to cut the extra price down. I'm assuming that they thought that a 19 year old didn't know anything about vehicles, but that's incorrect. And so is the assumption that I don't know anything about running a business. As an A&M business major, I'm telling you that these problems will not only cost them the money they could have made on the one sale of this vehicle, but will also inhibit them from many other opportunities to generate profits in the future. It is hard to run a good business when there is nothing positive about how the business in conducted, everyone knows that. There was one upside to my visit, however. That upside was getting to talk to one of the financial consultants, if you will, who I think was named Theo. He is amazingly knowledgable and is the only positive I took away from this experience. I will not be returning.",1.4

Within the last year I've been having issues with the service drive only. Everyone there is usually so nice and accountable.. But within last year I've had several issues take place.. Three times I brought my car in for oil, rotate tires and wash.. Three times my tires weren't rotated but dealership stated they did. Also had warranty issues, somewhat resolved. Also, no one in service ever returns a call or it takes 3-4 days before doing so.. Before, it wasn't like that. I was also charged for tire rotations that never happened as said up above. Credits of rotations were gone, never credited back. And your service advisor Sylvia needs more training and a better knowledge of her position. 
BUT  I will say this for positive feedback... Michele in rent/loaner car division is fantastic! She's helped me out through bad times and made things so much better. She's probably the only reason I'm still around and haven't gone higher up the chain.. She is very friendly and great customer service.. You better hang on to her.

I go and speak to the salesman who sold me my car, he tells me he will get it sorted. He brings my car back, tells me it was from the gas cap being loose, and that he got it fixed. I drive a few miles down the road, it comes back on. 3 weeks later after several days of back and forth I dropped my car off with the service department after finding the reason for my check engine light, the active grill. Michelle Paxton was super accommodating in getting a loaner car for me, but the people in the service department are not accommodating at all, they don't even greet you when you walk in. Daniel Quintanilla, my service advisor tells me that the service will take 3-5 days and that everything is still covered under a full factory warranty. 7 days later, I contact Daniel and ask for an update on my car, I am ignored. When I go up to the dealership they tell me they haven't even began service on my vehicle and that there are several cars in front of mine in service orders. After 10 days I finally get an update after days of persistent questioning Daniel. He tells me it will be $700 to fix, despite the fact he told me everything was covered under warranty, and despite the fact that it had been now been exactly 1 month since purchase. I asked when I could pick up my car, due to frustration, I just wanted my car back.

156,"August 16, 2016","I went in on Monday night, July 25, 2016 to look at a truck I wanted to buy. After a night full of negotiations, my salesmen Franklin Vernon and Brandon LaCour finally agreed on a price. At that time, it was 930pm and I had work the next morning at 7am. I explained to them that the piece of paper I signed my signature(s) next to all of my offers should be kept in the back so we can use it the next day and get the final paperwork ready. I come in on the next day around 7pm to find out the piece of paper, out of the five we wrote on last night, was ""missing"". The one piece of paper that had all of my offers and counteroffers received from Cindy Miranda, the Sales manager who was on duty Monday night. Obviously I was irritated so I asked to speak to the sales manager of whom Cindy came out of the office to speak to me. Long story short, she explained to me that she nor any other dealership would sell that truck for that low of a price. I then explained to her, in front of Franklin and Brandon, that she was the one that approved the final price we agreed on the night before. She explained she didn’t remember doing so and that if she did, she thought I was negotiating a lower finance amount instead of a drive out amount. She thought I was negotiating with her for the truck price plus a $5,000 down payment involved… this doesn’t make sense. I asked her why would I negotiate further with you if I am considering a $5,000 down payment? It doesn’t make sense for me or any customer to continue negotiations for a lower drive out price if the calculations already include a down payment... I would just put a larger down payment amount to lower my finance amount. She replied “I’m not sure why would you do that sir. I was following your lead”. At this point I was furious. She kept saying she didn’t know why I would do such a thing. I asked “given your experience and stature in this company, wouldn’t this type of negotiation raise a red flag to you?” She replied with “well I was taking care of about 3 to 4 other sales people so my focus was being stretched thin”. During our entire conversation she never apologized for her actions or words she said to me. She represented Clear Lake Dodge in a very negative manner as well as her direct reports of Franklin and Brandon. If she had just apologized, this review would never be here… as in everyone makes mistakes, just own up to them.
Allen Paul, the GM, and Sophia, the customer service manager, didn’t care to honor Cindy’s mistake and own up to the price she negotiated. They did ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to take care of a potential customer and offered the truck for $5,000 more than negotiated. Needless to say, I declined the offer and ran over to Gillman Dodge after looking at TrueCar. If you don’t believe me, give Gillman Dodge a call and ask for Joe. Tell him that Jag sent you and verify that I in fact drove off their lot with a brand new 2500 Ram truck. I don’t have anything to hide, I just don’t want anyone else to be treated as I was. Buyer beware!

I work in a major customer service industry (property management) and I would be appalled if my staff or team treated someone the way they treat their customers. I am very big on reviews and I am always the one boosting about how amazing people are because I don't believe people give enough good credit and always talked about the worst. Unfortunately I couldn't keep this one to my self as others were being treated the same while I was there. On a good note, there were some great salesman that were very helpful and nice but unfortunately I got to deal with a few very unpleasant liars. I really just want to write this in hopes it gets to the right people and also warn anyone of the scams. I wouldn't wish that type of customer service on anyone. I did end up going to Ron Carter Chrysler the same day and purchased the exact same vehicle for $4,000 less and a better interest rate through the same bank?? How weird it was for that to happen. One if the worst experiences of my life. Cindy is hands down the most unprofessional, rude, and disrespectful person I have ever encountered.",1.0

165,"July 20, 2016","We scheduled an appointment with Dorena our service advisor at this dealership on Tuesday, June 21, 2016. We were having problems with our 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee's alternator charging the battery when the car was running. I had the car towed in on Monday, June 20 because I did not want to discharge the new battery we had just installed on the way to the dealer. I started the car with the push button and drove it up to the tow truck while he loaded it up. When the car arrived Dorena called me and asked the issues I was having with the car so she could give the technician more information. She mentioned the tow truck driver had said it was having problems starting, I assured her the car was starting, and the problem we were having was the alternator would not charge the battery once it was on.

By Thursday, June 23 I had not received a call, when I tried to call into the dealership I was transferred several times and eventually hung up on. I finally got ahold of Dorina after a couple failed attempts, she explained that the car would be looked athrough later on that evening. Later on I recieved a call saying the car would not be looked at until Friday, June 24. Friday the same thing, another call, the car would not be looked at until Monday, June 27. 

Tuesday, June 28, Dorena calls and says it is probably the WIN module (the push button start and key turn starter), I asked her what the WIN module had to do with the alternator charging the car.. She replied it was all connected in the wiring so I took her word for it and gave her the go ahead to order the part which was going to come in the next day: Wednesday, June 29. The cost for the car was going to be ""something like $150 for labor and $475 for the part"" -per dorena

On Wednesday, I called about 20 times and was transferred over and over then it would bring me to some random persons voicemail or the robot at the beginning of the call and I would get hung up on. I sent an email to Jeff Kuithe stating 

To whom it may concern,

""I have been trying to get ahold of anyone in the service department for several hours. At this point I am about to come by and pick up my car and take it somewhere else. I have been put on hold then eventually hung up on several times and I am starting to get frustrated. Please have someone call me back by your closing hours or I will be forced to take further action.""


He replied:

""I apologize…we had new wi fi installed and they killed our phones and internet for hours…I am having someone call""

A few hours later, I recieved a call from Dorena saying the part was in but car would be looked at tomorrow, Thursday, June 30.

I called and got ahold of Jeff Kuithe on the first try on Thursday, he said I had 8 cars in front of me and it probably won't be ready until the weekend. I explained to him that I really needed the car over the weekend and we had plans for the 4th of July. He said he would have a talk with the technician and try and have it ready for us.

Friday the 1st of July, I never recieved a call or email. I had basically given up on having my car for the weekend at this point.

Tuesday, 5th of July I called pretty mad about not having my car for the long weekend. I was again transferred and hung up on 10 times. By the 11th person who picked up the phone I was so mad I said ""If I get transferred one more time, I am going to come and pick up my car with my spare key and you will probably not even realize it's gone"" Finally, I got an answer. The reason I was being transferred over and over was because my advisor, Dorena, was out of town... the lady on the phone said that Dorena made a note in the system saying that she had left me a voicemail and my car had been ready sense Thursday, June 30. I do not know how this is possible because I had spoken to Jeff at 5pm that same night and they close the service department at 6pm. I never recieved a call or voicemail from Dorena and I had my phone with me all day.

My husband, finds a ride to pick up the car at 6pm on Tuesday night. He was told the total would be $150 for the part and $475 for the labor +tax... the opposite of what Dorena had told me before. He went to look at the car before paying the outrageous amount of $650 and the push button start in the car was missing.. All of the people in the service department were gone so he had to leave the car there.

Wednesday, July 6, morning I send an email to Jeff stating:

""My husband went to pick up the car yesterday and the push button feature is missing. No one could explain to us why the cover push button piece was not in place. Please give me a call so we can resolve this, we really need the car back.""

To which he replies:

""Im xxxxx on it now. Confusing because we received it towed in will not button?? Im seeing wheat I can do.""

-I copied and pasted this email.. these are his real words.

I replied:

""It definitely had a button when it was towed in. I helped the driver load the jeep and I started the car myself. Please let me know when you guys have located the button.""

My husband found someone to take him to the dealership that Wednesday around lunch time. Jeff is available to speak with him and tells David that ""The tow truck driver must have taken the push button key, they have to remove them to secure the car to the tow truck, but we are going to replace it for free anyways"" -the first part of this statement is completely wrong, I myself helped the driver get the Jeep on the tow truck and I watched until he left my house.. He did not remove anything from the Jeep or I would have seen him do it. My husband tells Jeff that if he is going to replace the push button he needs to reprogram the keys to the car... Jeff assures him that this is not necessary and the car would be ready and working later on in the afternoon.

My husband could not find a ride Wednesday afternoon so Thursday morning, July 7 he has someone take him on his way to work. When David gets in the car, and guess what, the car DOES NOT START, because, of course, the keys are not programmed as my husband had explained to Jeff the day before. They mention to my husband that we will recieve a discount for our trouble.

My husband goes to drop off the spare key to get reprogrammed Friday morning July 8 on his way to work with another ride. 

Dorina said the car should be ready that night when I talked to her on the phone around 2pm.

5pm on Friday my husband recieved a call saying they could not figure out what was wrong with the car, they offered him a rental car but he declined because we had found a loner car from a family member for the weekend already.

I got a call from Dorena at 4:30pm on Wednesday July 13 saying the car was finally ready and they had to replace the whole computer to fix it. My husband was unable to find a ride to pick it up before they closed.

Thursday July 14, my husband goes to pick up the car and they tell him he cannot have a discount as origionally discussed because the computer alone was $600. Dorina also stated ""They also found why the car was not charging and fixed it for free"" remind you this is why the car was there in the first place. 

I call Dorena while my husband is paying and remind her of our origional conversation when the car first arrived at the dealership when I explained the alternator was not charging the battery but it was in fact starting. All she could say was she would have to check her notes but she would only give us a 10% discount. She was very rude and did not acknowledge any fault on the service side of this whole thing.

The WIN module never needed to be replaced. If the technician would have just gotten in the car and tried to start it he would have seen that himself.

My husband paid the $600 and I write an email explaining everything in this review to Allen Paul ""General Manager"". I never recieved a response.

My advice: Stay away from this dealership they do not care about you, or your car and their technicians cannot put things back together that they take apart. You will waste a ton of time like I did, my car was there for 3 and 1/2 weeks for a problem that could have been fixed in 2 days elsewhere.",1.0

168,"July 12, 2016","We purchased a 2012 Challenger. My salesman Josh Ryan was excellent but the sales manager Rafiel is very dishonest.  We bought several things to their attention that was wrong with the car that we wanted fixed.  They promised to fix them just bring it back the following week.  The following week we bought the car back (only had it 4 days) several other thing were found during that time. When I handed the listed I generated we were basically laughed at.  My husband is a disabled vet and is hard of hearing and suffers from PTSD.  I had just had surgery and couldn't stay until everything was completed. The sales prices that was agreed upon was $15,500. By the time it was finalised the total was $22,000.00. We had already been per approved by our bank and we have the information the bank said to give them which we did. After 2 hours waiting I had to leave. When the finance person Scott finally met with him he had  used their finance company instead of our bank. Talked my husband into using their finance company by promising all kind of things for free (oil changes, repair all door dings, tire or rim damagea replaced, etc. My husband ask for extended warranty and Scott added Gap insurance plus two other insurances. NO extended warranty but was lead to believe that's what we were getting. Also charged us $495.00 for tinted windows that was already on the car not just put on the windows it had been there since car was orginally sold. Charge for wheel locks which I purchased myself and put on because there wasn't any on the tired. When it was all said and done Scott had added $1885.00 for aftermark accessories.  This was not a new car and we did not get anything new added  to the car. Unfortunately I wasn't there for the finally signing I would have realized the numbers were way off.  Scott had him sign all the papers so fast he was trusting him.  When I sat down and want over the contract I about past out. And of course it was too late we had the car for two weeks. Knowing he was a disabled vet on a fixed income and SCAMMED him like that. I have left a message for the General manager and finance manager but no response. Plus that will not honor the repairs promised. Rafiel ""we aren't fixing anything on the car""  I'm going to write to the TV  stations and let them how a disabled vet was treated by this dealership.  DO NOT BUY FROM CLEAR LAKE DODGE..THEY ARE VERY DISHONEST.

177,"June 13, 2016","This dealership uses classic bait and switch methods to try and sell you a more expensive car.  I went to the dealership interested in a low mile, used car they had listed online for a great price. I test drove the car, and was sat at a table by the salesman to go ""talk to the sales manager"". When he returned he informed me it had all been a big mistake, that the car I test drove was actually already sold. When I asked about 2 other cars I had seen listed, he quickly said they weren't available either, for various reasons. Then he proceeded to try and sell me a new car.  I ended up leaving the dealership but quickly got a call from the used car sales manager offering me to test drive the car I had originally gone in to purchase. After explaining to him what had happened, he assured me they had some good, low mile used cars on the lot and asked me to return the next day to see him.  

I returned the next day and test drove a couple of cars and was interested in one of them. After being asked to sit and wait for another hour, he gave me an offer paper, and when I asked if I could take the offer letter home to discuss it with my spouse, he refused, saying the paper could not leave the dealership.  Well thank you, but no thank you. I will not be pressured into such a huge purchase on the spot.

Now, five days later every vehicle I was interested in, including the one I originally test drove and was later told it was already sold, are STILL listed for sale on the website for rock bottom prices. How many people go to the dealership interested in them only to be told, ""oops, that car isn't available""?

193,"March 21, 2016","I have been a Dodge owner since 1994 and have never experienced such Poor Customer Service until my experience with Clearlake Dodge Webster.  I bought my 2015 Dodge Ram 1500 from Clearlake Dodge Webster and recently brought it in to the Service Department for some warranty work.  There was an engine noise, several spots on the hood and some of the weather stripping was loose on the top. Clear lake Dodge kept my truck for 5 days, only to tell me they could not duplicate the engine noise, they had to get approval from Chrysler to repaint the hood and they had fixed the weather stripping on top. Clearlake Dodge told me to I could pick up my truck and they would call me when they got approval from Chrysler to repaint the hood. When I arrived at Clearlake Dodge to pick up my vehicle, I checked the weather stripping on top and I could visibly see it was still loose. When I pointed this out to my Service Adviser, he took the truck to the back and fixed the weather stripping problem in 10 minutes. As I previously stated they kept my truck for 5 days. When I received the call from Clearlake Dodge Service Department that they have received approval from Chrysler to repaint the hood, I dropped my truck off there.  3 days later I received a call from my Service Adviser that my truck was ready for pick up.  I drove to Clearlake Dodge and picked up my truck. I was at home and realized the 5.7 Liter Hemi decals were missing off both of my fenders.  I called my Service Adviser and told him about the problem.  He proceeded to give me the name and number for the off-premise body shop and said it would be better if I called the body shop and explain the problem, even though I dropped off my truck at Clearlake Dodge and not the body shop. The body shop told me the emblems would have to be reordered. No one at Clearlake Dodge told me the emblems would have to be reorderd when I picked up my truck.  So I contacted my Service Adviser and he told me he would order the parts and call me.  On Friday, March 18, 2016 I received a call from my Service adviser, that the parts were in and I told him I would be by the following Monday, he said fine I will putt hem on for you.  On Monday, March 21,2016 at 9:45AM I called my service adviser and told him I was on the way to Clearlake Dodge, he said come on by.  I arrived at Clearlake Dodge at 10:30 AM and walked in to see there were four other people waiting to see my Service Adviser, but he was not there.  The Service Adviser stationed next to his desk, began asking those waiting if she could help.  When she got to me I told her why I was there, but she never said come to my desk I will help. Instead, my Service Adviser was paged several times. After 30 minutes I was told my Service Adviser was at lunch.  I waited from 10:30 AM until 1:00 PM, for my Service Adviser.  The Service Adviser that was stationed next to mine, saw me standing outside waiting and came out and asked me again what I was there for, I told her again and she said my vehicle would have to be taken over to the body shop to have the emblems put on.  She then called the body shop and asked if they would send someone over to put them on and they said yes.  I waited another 30 minutes and someone came to put on the emblems.  After they had placed the emblems on, I noticed the one on the driver side was not lined up correctly with the Ram 1500 symbol.  When I brought this to their attention, I was told that the 5.7 Liter Hemi emblem was straight and the Ram 1500 symbol was not straight.  I asked to speak with a manager and Jeff Keith came out and told me, he had looked at other trucks and my emblems were mounted correctly. Basically, he told me I was imagining things.  I told Jeff that I was very displeased with The Poor Customer Service I have received here and that I would never purchase another vehicle from Clearlake Dodge and would not reccommend Clearlake Dodge to anyone.",1.2

Well, their offer on my truck was $7000.00 short of what CarMax and other dealers offered. That was a joke. I asked them for my keys back so I could go elsewhere, they jerked me around to the point I was getting very frustrated. While I waited for my keys, the manager came out and offered his apology and asked for a chance to make things right. Long story short, they made it right alright. They offered a grand less for my truck which I was ok with but after signing the papers I realized they never actually gave me a price for their truck and believe it or not they added 3 months to my finance without saying a word. Yes it's my fault for not checking but it is very deceitful on their part. Lastly within 12 hours of tanking my new truck(used) I noticed the dash was cracked. They straight up told me I bought the truck as is and good luck. This crack is not something you easily notice so I mentioned how they added 3 months to my contract etc but their sale was made so they don't care.

After much debate another employee finally let me get service, but I wish it hadn't taken that much convincing that I was told to come in although they were booked.

I noticed that some of the work was just inspected so I asked why it was not done and it was explained to me.  OK fine so far....
Then the cashier hands me the key and says your truck should be out there, I look and no truck.  So they send someone to get it.  I stand there for 30 minutes!!  Keep in mind Tim and all of the other service reps can see me, no truck.  I finally ask where the truck is and if they lost it.  So he goes to look and finally comes back and tells me.  Well its parked behind 6-7 other cars and it will be 20-30 minutes before we can get it.  Why don't you sit in the waiting room.  Well as another service rep is leaving work at 5 she noticed me and says ""Are you still here?""  Yep I think you all have lost the truck.

229,"August 04, 2015","My initial experience with Clear Lake Dodge was actually a positive one. I knew which used car I wanted to buy off their lot. I spoke with a sales rep (Chris Hodder) over the phone and set up a time to see it over my lunch hour. We were able to finalize the deal in that time and they printed a temporary plate so I could take the car with me back to work. This is where the positive part of the experience ended. I had to go back to the dealer to finish the paperwork after work. It was the typical long, drawn out process waiting for the finance office. While waiting I had a conversation with an older woman also waiting around. She had purchased a car a few days earlier and realized it wasn't going to fit her needs. I wished her well and went on with my business. After I came out of the finance office I asked how her situation was going. It was clear she was upset. Basically her sales rep told her that there was nothing they could do and she would have to wait an unspecified amount of time to speak with the manager. Long story short I helped her get some movement by pushing on my sales rep to get the manager down to the floor.

I wish this were the end of my saga, but it continues. The next issue was that, while I didn't notice, my wife said the car had been smoked in and being in there aggravated her asthma. I called my sales rep and asked him if they could detail the interior with whatever they use for this sort of thing. He said they have a special process and would be happy to accommodate me. When I took my car in I asked for a ride back to work. The service department told me I would have to wait for the shuttle. So not thinking of asking how long the wait would be I went and waited. And waited, and waited. After 45 minutes I went back and asked them to find out the ETA of the shuttle. It was still over an hour away! I insisted they find another solution for me, as I was not going to take time off work to sit there. Eventually they found a service technician who gave me a ride and even offered to drop my car off when it was done. So one bright spot back in the picture.

When my car was dropped off it was clear they did nothing but vacuum the floors. I called my sales rep and asked him to come get it and personally make sure it was done as I asked. He said he was too busy to accommodate me but I could drop it off and take my chances with the shuttle again. I obviously declined.

One final major problem I noticed when I went to pick up my plates. The temporary plate Chris installed had an expiration date of one day before I bought it. So whether this was human error or I was driving around without valid registration I have no idea, but it just adds to the level of incompetence and unprofessional behavior this dealer exhibited.",1.6

262,"November 26, 2014","I'm writing this review because of the terrible experience I had with Clear Lake Dodge. I began searching for a specific 2014 ram laramie longhorn. No dealership in the Houston area had what I was looking for in stock, except Clear Dodge. So I filled out their contact info online about the truck they had in stock.

I finally received an email from the Internet salesman Carmine. I responded back with a confirmation of the Internet price for the ram longhorn. Later in the day, he sent a response and confirmed the price plus ttl. So I told him that I would be coming in the next Saturday.

Once my wife and I arrived at the dealership,..I met with the receptionist and told them I was here to see Carmine.

30 minutes later, he finally came to us and introduced himself. He told us that he is very busy and had another salesman complete the test drive and appraisal paperwork on my 2011 ram laramie. 

After waiting around an hour or so, Carmine and his assistant came over with the first proposal paperwork. 

Carmine presented to us a $15,000 for my trade (which was ridiculous after CarMax offered $22,000 for my trade. By the way I would highly recommend whomever is trying to trade-in their vehicle towards the purchase of a new one, to go by Carmax and get a free appraisal done so you can use it as bargaining power.) So my wife and I laughed and told Carmine your so way off. 

After reviewing the proposal, I noticed the price of the vehicle to be $4000 more than the online price. I called him out on it and he told me that ,""Well that's with all available incentives added. Not everyone qualifies."" I called BS on that excuse and my wife caught on with what he was doing with the numbers. Carmine was puzzled at what my wife told him and he said "" I'll be back , they forgot to add something"". My wife and I were really getting frustrated. 

Carmine came back with a better offer for our trade but the price of the truck with ttl still didn't match up to the Internet price.

So I pulled up the email to show him the price he confirmed and our conversation. He then said ,..this is our offer. Which was still NOT the correct msrp price of the truck. 

So we just walked out. As a police officer and military veteran,(in which he knew I was) I have never been lied to and disrespectful in my entire life when negotiating a new vehicle. Stay Away fro Clear Lake Dodge.

On a positive outcome, I was able to complete a great deal with Demontrond in Conroe with the EXACT truck I was looking for with MORE options added. The truck I just bought, had a higher msrp than the one at Clear Lake Dodge and I was able to complete a GREAT deal with Demontrond at $3,300 less than what Carmine offered. Best buying experience ever at Demontrond!!!!!",1.0

Got to the dealership and talked to James White who said it had gone to auction that very morning with safety issues, would we like to look at another car? Foolishly we did. We were shown a Caravan which was plain jane and we looked at a Kia Sorento, both with a higher cost. We decided on the Sorento at the advertised price. After all of the add-ons and financing we agreed on the deal. When we got the car home we discovered a flat spare tire, missing jack handle and wrench, and a broken seat back. Also alignment was atrocious. We went back to see about these things and to get the second key and remote. We were told that they would not be able to fix any of the problems or furnish the second key. We finally got them to agree to fix the seat, but nothing else.

268,"October 10, 2014","I have read some of these reviews and I can tell you it all starts with you and how you approach a dealership that brings out the favorable results all of us consumers want. We want the best deal and the dealership wants to maximize their profits which is very normal. I have always believed that failure to plan is planning to fail and with the technology available these days you should do your research and have a positive attitude and everything falls into place. I just bought a Brands new Chrysler 200c with all the bells & whistles from this dealer and my experience was beyond remarkable. I started by building my the car on the Chrysler website and added all the options I wanted, researched in advance on every available rebate and the site pointed me to this dealer who honestly has the largest inventory amongst all dodge dealers in Houston. I also had to trade in a vehicle and I got my best trade in value from Edmunds.com & KBB.com and I was ready. I called the dealer and spoke to salesman Chris Hodder and his manager James White who were both very accommodating and I negotiated down the MSRP and I knew ahead o time what I needed to pay even before I set foot in this dealership. Both these gentlemen were true to their word and gave me a fair price for my trade in and I was out of this dealership in just under two hours driving my 2015 Chrysler which is a dream. The finance Manager Dane Bassard was equally competent and very nice to deal with. I received follow up calls from both James and Chris the very next day enquiring if I was fully satisfied with my purchase and I complemented them for their phenomenal service and attention to detail. Everyone I came in contact was wonderful and very friendly and made me feel that they truly wanted my business,

269,"October 07, 2014","I will most likely never shop at clear lake dodge again. I've purchased 2 vehicles from here and I felt as a repeat customer I should of been treated a little bit better but I ultimately felt like I was wasting my time. 

My husband had sent an email to the Internet sales team on a Saturday afternoon, inquiring on the 2014 Durango and was quoted a specific price of $29,500. When we arrived we were shown a vehicle that was around $34,000. We asked about the vehicle we were quoted and salesman had acted like we were insane for thinking there was a vehicle for a lower price. He said we were absolutely not going to find one that low. Yet we had been told that over the phone as well as in an email. We called back after we left to speak with who we originally spoke with and she said she would figure it out because we were quoted a specific price. After that we didn't hear from anyone, even after my husband called a couple of times. We were told that she had left for the day at 7:30pm. Come Monday we received a phone call that they had found this mystery vehicle... So I stopped in. The sales guy seemed like he was just about the deal not really making sure I was satisfied about the right deal. It was the last day of the month, I know how eager sales people can be about the quota they need to make but you need to be compassionate about the customer as well. I wasn't a huge fan of this version I was shown but figured I would see what they would offer. He said my 2010 Dodge Ram would be bought for $9,000 as a trade. This made me laugh because I was quoted $17k from another dodge dealership. He kept asking about the muffler on the truck and why there weren't any pipes. ""Why were they cut off."" I advised him that the exhaust had been dumped. He looked super confused and kept asking why it didn't have pipes and if it had passed inspection. 1. This truck was bought with one pipe not pipes, just one. 2. It has an exhaust, its just dumped for better mileage, better for the air etc., etc., 3. As someone who should be an expert in their product why didn't he know any of this?!!! I couldn't let them steal my truck out from under me like that. It's in great condition when we purchased it, sticker price was $42k. He said it would just sit on the lot and be a hard sell. Yeah, I don't think so, loud truck and in Texas..?!!! That definitely turned me away. I don't need a ""new vehicle"" I wanted a new vehicle because I am a new mom and was looking for a mom car, thanks anyways! ",1.0
270,"September 25, 2014","My son went to Clear Lake Dodge to look at a truck they had advertised for 12,450 and after test driving it he decided to start the process to purchase it.  My son needed a co-signer and so he called and asked us to help him.  After getting approved my son was given a monthly price of 400.00 per month and that did not sound right for the cost of the truck.  We asked them to email us a copy of the finance paperwork and the price of the truck was showing 15300 (before tax, title, license and financing) when we inquired as to why the price went up over 3000.00 and that the online price is what we agreed to not this price then we find out that they included 2000.00 worth of repairs that were never disclosed to my son PRIOR to talking to financing.  Also, there were other QUESTIONABLE fees added to the price that just didn't make any sense.  Even after the fees added and looking at the final price with financing, it still should not have been over 400.00 a month. After arguing with them over the phone (Mark Martin) we told our son to get his stuff and walk away that they are a shady dealership and I wouldn't trust the vehicle after dealing with people who are as unscrupulous as them.   
After my son left, the sales man (Daniel) called my son back, apologized, and told him that they would take care of all of the repairs at the 12,000 price if he would come back.  My son called us to tell us what they said but, since I used to work for a dealership, I know how that goes, we told him to just keep walking that I wouldn't trust them to fix anything especially since we were looking a carfax the whole time that we were dealing with them and we told our son that the Battery was showing as replaced (on carfax) he said really?

275,"August 25, 2014","I have purchased many cars in my time, I have to say this is the worst dealership I have ever been to!

I showed up on a Saturday to see a vehicle they just listed online, I got the run around and then they said it was in service.  They couldn't find the vehicle, so they assumed it was there.

I never received a follow-up call to let me know the vehicle was out of service, as I requested.  I call again on Monday and was told the vehicle will be in service until about Wednesday.  I asked why the vehicle would be in service so long, they did not know.

I called on Wednesday to ask for the vehicle, they said they had it and it would be ready for when I came at 6 pm.  This was one of the most dirtiest cars I have seen at a dealership to purchase.  It looked like they took it to the beach for the weekend. The leather seats looked awful, you couldn't tell if they were damaged or just that dirty.  I asked some basic questions like: Why was the car in maintenance since Saturday? Why does the car have 1,300 more miles then it was listed for? Every time I asked Benny a questions, he would just huff and puff with no reply.  Then he had a manager come by, the manager said, ""We will have this ready for you tomorrow at the same time.  We will have all your questions answered and the vehicle will be cleaned.  We will contact you tomorrow when everything is complete.""

I never heard from them on Thursday, so called around 4 pm and they had to check the status on the car.  I received a call back and was told the car was just sent to detail and they are working on getting answers for my questions.  When I arrived the vehicle looked clean from the outside, they cleaned most of the vehicle inside but it didn't look like a car being sold at a dealership.  I asked if they could finish cleaning the inside, the sale guy didn't seem happy but he go it done.  The car was also not in Maintenance, it was used for a radio event. They are just LIERS!

When we sat down to talk about the price and the total cost with taxes and title, he just brought a paper with the list price and was telling me to just sign the paper.  I said, ""no"" and started to look at the invoice.  They added a fee for $400 dollars for a service the sales guy could not explain.  He told me financing will inform me of what it is, but he wouldn't confirm before I sign.  So he wanted me to sign and pay for something that he couldn't explain.  Very SHADY!!!!

Then as we went back and forth, he brought the most unprofessional person at this dealership.  Lucky for him, because he should not be employed in the service industry and I would report him if I knew him name.

When the sales person brought this person to our table, he started talking to me as I never purchased a car before.  I came in with CASH to purchase a car this day.  He told me our price is what it is, I tried to make an argument about the additional 1,300 miles on the vehicle, they didn't care.  He basically got up and said, ""thanks for coming in"" and tried to shake my hand. I just got up with my wife and decided to leave.

He followed us out the door, then asked to speak with my privately.  The first things out of this mouth, ""Why are you being such an xxx.!""  I just walked back inside to get my wife and we started walking out.  He followed us to my car and then called me a ""xxxxx"" for not listening to him.  Then another sales guy came out and I said this guy just called me a ""xxxxx"", he just laughed and walked off.

I started to bicker back and forth with him, he then calls me out to fight.  This is when Danny, a sales guy, came up to us and asked me to leave and he didn't say anything to his colleague who was yelling and cussing at me.

Then as I drive off, you all three sales guys laughing and mocking the situation that just occurred.

I drove straight to LoneStar Chevrolet and bought the same vehicle but in the R/T model instead of Crew model.

The second place I went to was Ron Carter in friendswood I walked in the door and not one person waited on us we had to go up to them. Then they lied and said the car had a dent in the door and they just sent it off to be serviced even though I just called them and told them I was on my way and would be there in 20 min. They were very rude. I then went home disappointed and a little discouraged but I didnt give up I then went to the dodge dealership website and found a car that I wanted at a very good price and within my budget. I had my now sales representative Victor Cruz call me and talk me through everything. He was extremely helpful and nice. I went over there to go look at a fiat that he had mentioned and as soon as I pulled up we had someone greet us. I was so surprised and happy he did after having a bad day that day. It was nice to see a smiling face. He then went out of his way to make sure we met with Victor and that our time there was pleasant.

281,"March 11, 2014","I hate that I have to waste my time writing a bad review but I feel compelled by what happened to me at this dealership.  Please note that I have tried for several months to make this right with the sales folks but they do not return my calls and when I show up they keep me waiting and then have nothing to offer.  That being said, let me explain...
I am a very loyal Mopar fan.  Since 1966 my family and I have had at least one Plymouth, Dodge, Chryser, Ram vehicle in our driveway.  I currently have 3 different trucks including my latest purchase, a deep cherry red Ram 1500 Crew Cab 4x4 Sport.  Please understand, I truly love having this truck and I have no issues with it whatsoever.  The sales process to get it that I experienced at the hands of my sales people - Carmine, and the sales manager - Eddie M - is a different story. 
I've noticed that I am rambling a bit so let me be brief now.  They sold me the truck with a 7 year, 100,000 mile bumper to bumper warranty that also included ""maintenance"" - this was written down and signe by myself and the sales people.  When I discussed what maintenance was with Carmine and Eddie at the time of the deal, we agreed that it included things like oil changes, and transmission and radiator flushes.  I was also told when I signed the deal that I would receive some kind of a coupon book for the scheduled maintenance of the truck.  
Flash foward, now I am almost to 5k miles on the truck and 3 months after the deal and I still do not have this coupon book.  I have called repeatedly with no answers and certainly no call backs.  When I showed up last week it was like they did not know I was looking for them and they certainly had no clue what I was talking about.  In fact, they even went so far as to say that they never agreed to selling me any kinds of a maintenance plan since no such thing exists.  After a few hours or back and forth, Eddie pulled out the signed deal and saw where it said ""maintenance included"" in a handwritten note that was signed.  He then started back peddling and said that:
1.  Since it was not his handwriting that he could not explain what it meant.
2.  He did not recall seeing this when he signed the deal.
3.  Since it did not say ""all scheduled maintenance as per the owner's manual"" that it did not cover anything.
4.  Since the dealership lost money on the deal that I should be happy with what I have and forget about this.
5.  Chrysler does not have anything like a ""maintenance included"" package so he cannot honor the note.

I could go on and on about these points but I won't.  Let me just say that it truly stinks the way these people are behaving.  I personally believe that when you make a deal, you should stand behind it but apparently that is not the case with Clear Lake DCJ.  So, my warning to you is that you should NOT use this dealership.   But, if you do, please make sure you understand that just because it is in writing and signed, it does not mean you got the deal you think you put together.  ",1.8

I have to say that I have never encountered the problems with any other dealership as I have here. If you are reading this review please take note that you are taking a chance having this dealership work with you on pre-existing problems on vehicles that they sell you even when they are new. We have had our truck in the shop over 4 times now in a matter of a year. We recently had taken the truck back to them for the vibration in the truck and they informed us that they had to replace the tires in order to be able to diagnose the problem. (Keep in mind that there were only 16,000 miles on this set of tires. We also had been told by this dealership at 8,000 miles that we needed to replace the tires. So we replaced them then.) We agreed to replace them AGAIN, but requested that they give us our old tires. Not to charge us a disposal fee and just put the tires in the back of the truck because we could use them on our other old vehicles. Needless to say- when we went to pick up the truck and paid $1500 for the new tires we did not have our old tires in the back of the truck. ""Ike"" in the service department was absolutely no help. Basically keeping this long story short, someone in the service department took the tires home and kept them. We were promised that the tires would be there the next day. Plus- the truck still had a vibration to it so we went ahead and left it again. Two weeks later we go to pick the truck up and the vibation is not ANY better. (Especially after some of the weights that they attatched to the rims of the tire have fallen off. We never knew they had put these on until we got home and tried to see why the truck was still vibrating after the dealership said that several people had driven the truck and it ran fine.) The best part of this story- THEY NEVER GOT OUR TIRES BACK!!!!!!!! Several calls have been made to the service manager Jeff in reference to this issue with NO return call.

The bottom of this vehicle was blatant and all the pictures online did not show the rust.  This was deceitful and cost me a great deal of money on airfare and cab rides.

The salesman I worked with and purchased from was Mr. Trice Ham. EVERY WORD Mr. Ham told me was 100% true - he never pressured me - was very friendly - and went out of his way to give me what I wanted. 

More impressive was the fact that the vehicle we wanted was at a dealership in northwest Houston (not very friendly staff too), for a great price. I informed Mr. Ham of my regret that this vehicle (do to color) was not on Clear Lake's lot for the price they quoted me. Mr. Ham went and got the vehicle and honored their price quote THE VERY NEXT MORNING!

Needless to say, if it were not for Mr. Ham's personallity and efforts I would have had to make the trip to far nothwest Houston for the purchase - something, due to that dealerships staff, I did not want to have to do.

My last purchase was a 2007 Tahoe. Although Lincoln the on-line sales manager was very hospitable, I was disappointed to find out after asking on several occasions if the vehicle had diagnostics ran on it only to find out later that it wasn't. Slap on the hand to you guys for this. I am a repeated customer and things like this can cost your company in future sales. Over all however, I am very satisfied and plan on making future purchases at this location. Your staff is friendly, sales people are professional as well as your management team. The biggest complaint I had was with the loan officer, and his attempt to belittle my wife after turning down an extended warranty. We nearly walked out of the deal over his behavior. No store is perfect and you shouldn't hold everyone accountable over one person. I am being as honest as I can so people can know what they might expect things aren't always going to go as smoothly as we would all like on occasions.

I had taken my car in for some extensive TLC as it was getting close to the 100k mark, and I would like for it to take me for at least another 100k. There was some body work, full engine and transmission service, new brakes and some fixings on the interior. While it did take a couple of weeks to get all of the work done over the holidays, they did an awesome job and were super friendly and helpful at all times - even when I was getting a little impatient. When I received my car back, there was a minor fix that hadn't quite been completed, and a strange rumble was evident. We arranged to take it back and they fixed the minor thing quickly and efficiently, but were unable to find the cause of the rumble, advising me to bring it back if/when it rumbled again.

The rumble just got worse until I went in and insisted the service guy, Max, come for a joy ride with me to experience the rumble. He and his tech both agreed there was something wrong, but it may not be related to the work they did. I got upset at this as surely, ""It must have been related to the work they did!!"". We agreed that I should take the car back in to be checked out the next day.

So, at the third time to take my Magnum to the dealer, I was starting to get upset, having spent a LOT of money to make her sweet. It is here that I have to step up and bring full recognition to an outstanding level of customer service at Clear Lake Dodge. Not only was I provided with a courtesy car - again - which I was not expecting, they discovered that the rumble issue was NOT related to the work they did, but they fixed it anyway, AND washed my car - again!

315,"January 26, 2012","This review is regarding the integrity of this particular dealership, not the product.  I completely love my dodge truck and recommend the Ram 1500 to anyone.  I will never recommend anyone purchase a vehicle from Clear Lake Dodge in League City.  I purchased a brand new Dodge Ram 1500 with the ram boxes in June of 2010.  I paid the dealership to have the back of the pickup sprayed with a Rhino Liner, which they contracted out to a third-party because they were unable to do it on the premises.  Three days later I went to the dealership to take possession of my new truck (until then, I had never taken possession) and found that the driver side ram box was damaged.  I was assured, by one of the managers who happened to be my salesman, not to worry.  He told me to take my new truck home and enjoy it and that he would order the piece to fix it and let me know when it comes in.  So, trusting that it would be taken care of (after all, it was a brand new truck with a great warranty) I left the dealership with my new (slightly damaged) truck.  Several MONTHS and many calls later, the truck was finally repaired.  Then the very next day the colored panel of the damaged ram box popped off again.  It turns out they fixed the wrong piece.  They replaced the colored panel, but the actual lid of the ram box is what needed repairing because the place where the colored panel attaches was damaged on the inside of the ram box lid.  Again, I was told to go home and don't worry about it.  They sent a technician outside to take pictures of the damaged area of the box lid and said they would order the proper part this time.  We are now one year and seven months later and I STILL have a broken ram box.  I have gotten the run around so bad that I had to call Dodge corporate office to try to get something done.  They refused and told the Dodge corporate office that this box is fixed and as far as they are concerned it is a closed case.  I ended up at another dealership, and after much back and forth with the service department, the Dodge corperation decided to fix my truck under a warranty order so that I can finally get my ram box fixed, and they are going to deal with the dealership internally.  So, after waving good-bye and allowing me to leave the dealership with a broken truck one year and seven months ago, and assuring me that they would fix it, that dealership was willing to allow me to swallow a $1,200 repair that was not my fault at all.  These people are not honest and I will never allow them to even change my oil, much less buy another vehicle from them.  And I will never recommend them to a friend.",1.0

324,"September 15, 2011","  Initially, I was not met by anyone at the service drive and there where no other cars on the drive.  I had to go in inside, where I eventually delt with Max Ridings the service advisor (no one else looked up).  I initially went for an oil and filter change and explained that I had a passenger side upper and lower ball joint that needed greased also. Three trips before, not with these same individuals, it was hard for them to comprehend that I had 2 grease zerts, figuring that all newer vehicles didn't need to be greased.  After explaining all of this to Max he seemed to understand and then mentioned a tuneup.  Knowing I had 94,000 miles, and it was convenient, I agreed to a tuneup but was rather shocked at the quoted cost (been a long time since I had a tune up I guess).  Then cleaning the throttle body was mentioned which was another charge.  Then it was brought to my attention by Javier, the service tech, that my battery was weak (which I already suspected).  OK, replace the battery (I really had a heart attack by that charge).  After all said and done, I'm a $1000.00 lighter in my pocketbook.  After returning home and inspecting under the hood I could not see any clear evidence of all the work that was suppose to have been done. I went back the second day, and with my explanation of my doubt, Max and Robert agreed to pull any plug (out of 16) to see if all had been replaced.  I watched as Javier (the tech) pull the plug I asked him to check and sure enough it had been replaced.  I requested this because of not seeing any footprints under the hood of maybe the work not being done and from my past experience with the ""OLD Clear Lake Dodge"".  All three gentlemen were very understanding and nice about making me feel comfortable with the work being done right.  I know every trip to the shop can become a different experience, either pleasant or a nightmare, but I was pleased with this trip.  Other than some of the charges being somewhat steep (which I rated a 3), it was a good experience.  I have noticed at times that you seem to be invisible when arriving at the service drive, and when you go in no one looks up to acknowledge you are there.  But after all the discussions with Max, Robert, and Javier attempting to understand my plight, I will give them a 5.  I doappreciate the effort and honesty each one exhibited.

327,"July 18, 2011","We were looking for a used truck for our son, Brett. We had been to the dealership a few days before and actually looked at a single cab new truck which was not what Brett really wanted. Brett found the truck we bought online two days later. We called Basil Zangare who had helped us on our earlier visit. Basil not only had the truck ready for a test drive but actually came in on his day off to help us. After we drove the truck we still wanted to explore a few more options before we made our decision. Basil was patient when we were not ready to make a decision right then. When we did decide to purchase the truck everything was handled in a timely manner and we were not there for hours. Dealing with Clear Lake Dodge and Basil Zangare was a positive experience for us.

I had my jeep put in for service for my oil gauge falling to low. They replaced a rear main seal because it leaked oil. (I knew about that and I knew it was the problem) They old me repeatedly that's what is causing my problem. A week goes by and I'm back for the same problem. This time they kept it for 2 weeks and could not find the problem. I go back a third time to prove to them that it was falling to to low so i talked to the service manger to take a look at my jeep outside. He took it in for the third time replaced a oil pressure sensor and told me this will fix it. Drive it down the block comes on again. They take it in for the 4rth time this time they keep it for 1 month my total time with them is 2 months in the shop for this problem. They told me they placed everything electrical to solve my problem, except the gauge cluster. Not only did they not replace the cluster, now when i drive my jeep. It has a check engine light, check gauges light, and it leaks oil from the main seal that they replaced, and also from the oil filter that they replaced. I have put 2 thousand dollars of my money into this jeep for the dealer to fix, they have wasted 2 months of my time jerking it in the service department. Mr. Robert Jackson(service manager is a prick, and gives you the impression he knows everything. He did not litterally call my dad and I liers to our face, but the way he would say, ""no that's not right, or no that can't be the problem"" he gave us the impression that he was calling us liers to our face.) The main techs sucks, they gaves me more problems with my jeep then what i brought it in for. THIS SERVICE DEPARTMENT SUCKS!!!! I DO NOT RECOMMEND THEM!!!

Also I had my liberty in for service(different vehicle) I had a front axle roaring real loud at highway speeds. They kept it for 2 weeks, and i spent 1000 bucks to get repaired. I drove it another 1,500 miles and my problem is back. This is my daily driver back and forth to work. I work in downtown live 30mins away. I had it serviced here and look what happens they can't fix crap.

I called the Clear Lake Dodge Jeep parts department to see if they had the part I needed and they did. Joe was the gentleman I was speaking to and he was very patient while listening to my issues I was having. He told me to take my Jeep in and ""he"" would take a look at it and see if it was the issue the garage was telling me it was. From the moment I arrived the entire dealership was awesome. As proised Joe went out to my Jeep and looked at the issue. He tried several things to fix the problem taking over an hour. The dealership closed at 7 but Joe worked way past that still diligently and patiently trying to help me out. He never asked me to leave and come back the next day or to leave my car, he was very kind and worked on the issue to resolve the problem. Joe fixed the problem. He resolved the issue and he triple checked everything to ensure that I was good to go.  I found the dealership to be an awesome experience.  I will ALWAYS get my parts for my Jeep there and when I am ready to get a new Jeep, this is the only place I will consider buying it from. I am a single middle aged female.

They will take advantage of you if you do not have someone there to stand up with you, not to mention it's smart to have another set of ears there to make it easier to point out the all the bull shit lines and deceptive sales tactics they use at this dealership.  I was lied to numerous times, I was mistreated by the Financial Manager to the point I was in tears and I was ignored by my sales guy on several occasions.  Make sure that before you sign that car agreement that any extras is covered and if any upgrades are made, make sure they have ordered the parts promised to you.

It took me 4 wasted trips, talking to a Sales Manager, and sending a really nasty email to the General Manager to get this all done --- 2 weeks after I bought my car.

I bought a Jeep Wrangler Unlimited from Allen Samuels in Clear Lake, they have since pulled out of there and I got a nice letter from Chrysler stating Clear Lake Dodge was now servicing our vehicle. So, I pull the car in the bay. Stood in the doorway to the service office, said I was there for an oil change. He asked if I was a new customer, i said yes. Didn't introduce himself or anything. He had me fill out some paperwork, then just took it and the key. I had to ask him where the lounge was, then he just pointed. 1 and 1/2 half hours go by and I walk out to the service area and see my Jeep just sitting in a lot of cars, who knows how long it had been there. So then I had to track him down. I walk into the service office, where another guy was playing a computer game, who so graciously stopped, asked what I needed then called ""Mike"" to the office. I asked him if I could get a status on my oil change. He then starts talking to a porter and blaming him for not bringing the key in and letting him know it was done. Seriously, isn't that his job to keep tabs on his customers. Then he starts trying to say ""Oh well, we also have a recall out so we had to check that"" (recall was for a faulty tow hitch installed on Jeeps, mine does not even have that package and a 5 second glance to the rear of the vehicle would have shown that)  ....... anyway he brings the work in the office, says thanks, and leaves. Now, that I have paid, I start the task for trying to find my car, it has now been moved to the other side of the building from where I last saw it. 

After I calmed down, I decided to call the service manager the following day, Chuck Flores. I left him a brief message on 12/17 and told him I wanted to share my first experience as a new customer and to please return my call. A month has passed, no return call. 

You would think that in this economy with people doing many service items themselves to save the cost of taking it to the dealership, that the dealer would be thrilled to have customers coming into their establishment. Apparently Clear Lake Dodge doesn't need any more customers and I surely will never go there again. ",1.4

The only negative thing I would have to say would only be when I have visited the shop. I have left there feeling dissatisfied with my questions about my wife’s vehicle.
Still overall, I can honestly say, each and every time I have ever gone there, I had no pressure to buy, no pressure to hurry and I felt I was in control all the way to the finance department. Even he has been pleasurable to deal with.

360,"November 18, 2009","My mother purchased a truck from Clear Lake Dodge. She noticed an imperfection on the side of truck (at the time of purchase, she did not cause the scratch) and they promised to fix the minor scratch. After about 2 months the scratch was finally fixed but the paint job was horrible. Low budget in my view. First of all, they painted the whole side of the truck (unnecessary) and on top of that the color did not even match. After some debate they agreed to fix THEIR mistake. They gave my mother the run around for about 2 weeks. Finally after calling every single day, they told her to drop off her truck so they could fix it. This process took 6 days. When she was contacted because her car was ready, the salesman was very RUDE to her. She explained that she was sick with the swain flu and would be unable to bring the car in until the next morning. He said he did not care and wanted the car back that day. The sales people, management and service department has proven to be rude and incompetent. 


Customer Service- Poor sales team. Poor management. They claim the management is “new”

Quality of Work- Paint color did not even match. Painted entire side of truck instead of covering up minor scratch.

Friendliness- Rude sales team. Rommel was very rude to my mother. I’m horrified that a any business would allow this behavior. 

Overall Experience- Pretty much horrible. Poor service, bad location and inexperienced team. She said they took her keys and would not return them until she made a purchase. Professional? No.

Price- I believe she was screwed in the price and pressured by the sales department.

My final call the same day was to Denise and I told her that I would purchase the car and what time could they have it ready. She gave me a time about 3 hours later, no problem. She even told me to see salesman Augustine Ramirez when I arrived and he would have everything ready. I drove the 80 miles to the dealership. When I got there and spoke to Augustine, things went bad. THE CAR WASN'T THERE!  THE CAR WAS NEVER THERE! They tried to move me to a car that was $3,500 higher and had 1700 miles on it instead. How in the hell can three separate people over a span of a day not realize that they are selling a car that THEY DON'T HAVE. And why didn't they call or email me in the 4 hours from my last conversation until I showed up? They had all of my contact information. Then the bankrupt liars tried to tell me it was being built and would be there in two weeks. Um, everyone in America knows their plants are all shut down for the next 60+ days. While I was in this dealership I witnessed the most unprofessional behavior I have ever seen. From the receptionist talking loudly about her boyfriend, to the salesmen that clearly give reason as to why this company is now bankrupt.

362,"February 04, 2009","I went to buy a radiator fan for my jeep. they where the only dealership that had it in houston.when i get there the sales person tells me that they dont have it in stock so i tell him i had just called and they told me they had it so he actually goes and checks and finds the fan. i paid $356.00 for this fan. when i get to the shop 10 minutes later the mechanic tells me that i dont need the fan that i need a relay so i call Clear Lake Dodge and explain to them and they said i can go back and get my money back. when i get there they take the part and say they have to inspect the part to make sure it was not used. so they take the part and they tell me i should be getting a check in the mail in about two weeks for my refund because they had no cash. i tell him i had just left about 45 min ago and that i had paid cash and i needed my cash back. he talked to his manager and they said they will call me later on that day so i can come pick up the check. so i left when i get back to the shop. the parts sales manager calls me and tells me i can go and pick up the part because they where not going to give me my money back. bacause the part looked like it was installed (which it was not true) it told him that the part was never installed not even taken out the box. he said ""WHAT YOU THINK IM STUPID ARE YOU QUESTIONING MY INTELLIGENCE I KNOW THIS PART HAS BEEN INSTALLED AND YOU ARE NOT GETTING YOUR MONEY BACK DO WHAT YOU HAVE TO BUT YOU ARE NOT GETTING YOUR MONEY BACK SO COME GET THIS PART AND DO WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO WITH IT"" i was shocked and mad to have a person talk to me this way so i told him if i could talk to someone else and he said no he was the parts manager and that the general manager was going to agree with him. and he hung the phone up when i went there to pick up the part i asked to talk to him or the general manager an i was told that they where out to lunch this was at 10:00am so please don t buy at this dealership they are theives and will rob you.",1.0
363,"October 07, 2008","salesman we delt with was rude and not helpful.  thought they were there the sale cars. staff is very unprofessional. not helpful at all. that dodge dealership ran my credit so many times it dropped it severly.
staff doesn't seem to care if they make a sale or not.",1.4
364,"October 06, 2008",we went to view a van i had seen online at first i was told it had been sold then they miraclously found it ...sucker!   Well we loved it so much we bought it in fact put 1500.00 down on it walked out... three days later got a call they found a better deal for us so we went back in put another 500.00 down.  Well 6weeks into the deal i get a phone call they want the van back the deal was never made due to the hurricane and they pulled our credit so much it dropped 22points and the same bank now wont finance us. Sorry thats bullshit!!  We had alegal binding contract and they get to get out of it but if we were to renig on it it would be on our credit as a repo.  Avoid the place like the plague what they did to us should be illegal!!!,3.0
365,"November 05, 2007",The original sales person i was dealing with was with a customer so i asked another dude not doing a damn thing if he could get me the keys to show me the car and his remark was i cant do anything to help you. so i left mad and decided to call and the lady that answered the phone needs to be working at a dog obedience class because thats how i talk to my dogs. I wonder if dodge would do a drop in visit to these people and see what the hell is going on.,1.4
366,"October 16, 2007",The Purchase of my new Dodge Mega Cab was quick and painless.  From the time I walked in to the time I left in my new truck was under 2 hours.  I have bought many vehicles in my lifetime and this was a first.  Mr Gomez and his staff were courteous and made sure that I was taken care of.  The price of my truck and the value given to my trade-in could not be matched at any other dealership.  Yhis was truely my best buying experience.  ,5.0
367,"February 27, 2007","Most people drive away froma dealership with a smile. We did not and they did not want to help us get a smile either.  And being first new car experience will never happen again. We did not have much choice  but to take the truck because they ran our credit so much it lowered our point score badly. SO we gave up the fight for the 2006 Dodge with the Cool Vanilla paint job, the Chrome  package, the wood grain interior, 6 disc cd changer and the strereo controls on the steering wheel for a 2007 Dodge  Silver with nerf bars . No wood grain  No 6 disc, No contols on steering wheel and no chrome. So we had a nice juicy steak they took it from us and gave a  hot dog. I kept asking well can you get us a white truck? Can you put wood grain? Something to make us alittle happier?No!  Pick one off the lo not to go over 34,000 All trucks on lot were the same inside  the exterior was different color and no white ones.  I told my partner that someone in the dealership wanted the truck because they kept making remarks about the color. We kept whining the entire time while they got the paperwork ready they did nothing to make us Happy. Well mad  i came home look at other dealerships around town. We could have got everything we wanted at another dealer including  leather if we wanted but we dont still was same price as this truck really was Cheaper.  like I told the sales man I was going to go there for my Chrysler  I would not now and He was smart mouthed to me saying we dont sale Chrysler well i always thought they were the same company and I know there are  use Chrysler. But just his way of saying  they dont need my money. But  any other dealership would have wanted repeat business this one doesnt. So after seeing  what we could have had when this trucks paid off we will not get to clearlake again. I found that they do this alot. Also when we returned the other key to the other truck we found out the manager now drives the 2006 Cool vanilla truck we wanted. Hmmm smells funny to me.  Already felt ripped off now we know I was right on someone in the dealership wanting the truck. Now if that is not bad business I dont know what to tell you. Buyer beware.  Go where the dealership wants a sale and  return business. Not just a sale and  who cares if you come back.  The was for my partner but where I wanted the 300 C  or  Magnuim . After this at Clearlake Dodge I'm not ever sure I will go with a Dodge or Chrysler product. Hell I came home and wanted to get rid of the Chrysler I already have that I love. Think I may try a Honda  or something or go back to my faithful Chevy",1.4
368,"February 27, 2007",Went into Clearlake Dodge. Told them we were looking for a truck Prefer a Dodge and Preferred White. They show us a Vanilla 2006 Dodge Truck  We like we test Drove it. Then we tried to get financed. Dont ever do this at this Dealer. They told us being it was after 6 they could not get it financed that day. They said they would be on it at 9am the next day. So My partner and I went in there at 9 am to make sure they get this going. The finance guy (Juan)said we needed more things to prove we were good He told us to take the vanilla truck and go get them have lunch and come back. We did as asked we came back he said he was pretty sure it was a done deal to go put full coverage insurance on the  truck and bring it back. So we did he said enjoy the truck for the weekend. We gave him a check for our down payment. Then he was to call us on Monday. Well over the weekend we fell in love friends family saying how nice the truck was. Well 1 pm come Monday we called Clearlake Dodge to see what was going on. Was put on hold to long hung up called back at 2:00 again put on hold. Come 3 pm they called us said the paperwork was not finished  would be ready the next day but yes it was a done deal. Tuesday comes got a phone call from Clearlake dodge about 10 am saying  Its a done deal come up at 12:15 and well sign the  paperwork. Well got there at 12:15  only to hear this Yes was a done deal but not for the truck we were driving. But we would have to pick a diferent Truck They said we could have a 2007 but not the 2006 we had been driving and had insurance and  miss lead thinking was a done deal on. We said fine can you give a 2007 just like the one were driving we know we cant have the Vanilla color but at least the features. Nope. I was upset said well why didnt you tell us on the phone we were approved but not for the Truck we were driving on the phone. To me that was very miss leading not very nice at all  might as well say false advertising making us believe was a done deal on the truck we wanted than dump the bomb when we get there to sign paper that did not exist. Never recommend this dealer,1.4
