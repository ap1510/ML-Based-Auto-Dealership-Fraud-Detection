0,"October 19, 2010","Talk about great people and service. Mike Vaughan andRon Baron are the best. He did a safety check on my vehicle and explained everything up front, NO surprises. Great Pricing, Great service and on top of all of that, a cleaned vehicle, washed and returned in a timely matter. If you want home town treatment and people who really care,even if you don't have a Lincoln or Mercury head to North Hills Lincoln Mercury in Hurst, you will not be disappointed!!",5.0

2,"May 11, 2004","I was in the market for a really nice 2nd car -- a big one and North Hills had a nice selection of them -- Mercurys and Lincolns. I narrowed down my initial eyeball assessment to a 1994 Mercury Grand Marquis and a 2000 Ford Taurus. However this car had sustained some very serious damage to the Passenger Side Rear Fender near the bumper that was very poorly repaired. I was honestly surprised to see something this bad on a Lincoln-Mercury lot. About this time I was greeted by the Salesperson, Arnold, who was very friendly in his approach and not at all overbearing and pushy. He offered to get the keys for the car and I accepted. He was very patient while I examined the car and offered a test drive. He told me they were asking $7,995 for the car. WAY too high for a 1994, but I understood the game of starting somewhere. The car looked great inside and out and drove very nicely. However, during the Test Drive, the Check Engine light came on. He assured me they would look into it and I told him to call me the next day.The next day he called to say it was a minor thing and it had been taken care of. At that time, I made -- after checking Kelly Blue Book, Edmunds, and Black Book -- an offer of $3,500. He said he would check and then called me back to say the lowest they would go was $4,700. I said this was too high and he said he would check again and call back. He did not. Finally, I called him that afternoon and he said they would not budge. He then said, what about $4,100? I said no. The next day I called back to make a counter-offer of $3,700. Again he said he would call me back. The entire day passed and he did not. I finally called the next morning and he told me no they wouldn't accept my offer. I told him again that I felt the offer was fair and would he check again. He said he would but again never called back. Frustrated, I fired off an email to the attention of the General Sales Manager, confident they would get right back in touch with me. Absolutely no reply. Thinking I could contact the owner, I called and asked for their email address and was told they had no idea what it was. This is one of the worst example of Follow-up, Sales Negotiation, Customer Service and Fair Pricing I have ever encountered. I would strongly not recommend this dealership to anyone based on my experience.",1.3
