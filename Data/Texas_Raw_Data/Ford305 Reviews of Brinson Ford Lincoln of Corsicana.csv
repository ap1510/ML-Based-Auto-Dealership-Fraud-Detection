0,"June 02, 2020","Wasn't looking forward to taking my truck in for a service repair but my attitude was quickly changed as soon as I arrived due to the tremendous service of all the people at Brinson. I was quickly greeted with a smile from one of their service reps Mindy who assured me everything would be taken care of in a orderly and cost efficient manner.  Next I talked to Mike who talked me through everything and gave me a very good and accurate run down of all the things my truck would need, he assured me that if anything changed they would call and discuss with me before moving forward. Most of the time I feel confused about whats really happening when I leave the mechanic but thanks to Brinsons stellar team I left with a smile on my face, feeling confident that everything would be taken care efficiently. Thanks Brinson Ford",5.0
1,"May 20, 2019","We were in the market for a new truck and chose to look locally first. Never again. Mason seemed great at first, then his dishonest side showed up. Do NOT tell me that you only get paid $175 for each vehicle that you sell! You work on commission. The manager, Justin, refused to come off his throne and speak with us. They tried to sell me a truck with almost 3000 miles on it for the same price as one with less than 200 miles on it. I asked for an extended warranty or something to offset the fact that there were so many miles on it. Justin offered a dealership mug or a hat, if they had one! Talk about insulting. No thanks. I am not tethered to Navarro County. Found EXACTLY what I wanted, less than SIX miles on the truck, an extended warranty, weathertech floormats, spray on bedliner for less than they were trying to get out of me.Go North, Children.

2,"April 29, 2019","It was a pleasure working with Mason Bigler to purchase my 2019 Platinum Ford Expedition. I researched SUV's for 6 months. Brinson Ford in Corsicana had the best internet price. When I called the dealership and spoke to Mason for the first time I let him know I had done all my research and I knew what I wanted. We agreed to meet around 12. The drive to Corsicana was over an hour and well worth it. I let Mason know when I was 15mins away. When I got to the dealership he was outside with the key in his hand ready for the test drive. I explained to him I had a family party at 4pm in Arlington that I couldn't be late for. Mason was very professional, knowledgeable, and easy to work with. We arrived at a fair price for the vehicle and the trade in. I would definitely recommend Brinson Ford to family and friends.",4.8
3,"March 02, 2019","Like some other reviewers, I’m giving just one star because it is not possible to give zero. The degree of professionalism and business practice that my wife and I just experienced borders on unethical and only serves to perpetuate the stereotype of the shady used car dealer who has no interest whatsoever in anything other than swindling you into a used car through a bait and switch. Briefly, my wife and I found a listing for a 2016 Toyota Camry XLE with just over 27,000 on Car Gurus. At the time we expressed interest in the vehicle, it was being sold through the sister location in Athens. We sent an inquiry THROUGH Car Gurus, which listed to the seller the car information as posted on the website, and it was confirmed to us that the car was still in stock on 02/28/19. We checked again on Friday (03/01/19) and saw that the location had changed to Corisicana but was still in stock under the same listing information. We scheduled a test drive for Saturday morning (03/02/19) with all confirmations still indicating the make, model, year, and mileage.

We get there and immediately notice that the vehicle is not an XLE but is instead the base LE. A brief inspection of the car also showed that only the back tires were new while the front ones had less than an eighth of an inch of tread left. There were also some dings and scratches that had been poorly covered. Once we started test driving, we noticed that the mileage was also wrong: it was about 6,000 miles more (over 33,000 miles) on the odometer. We were told that the discrepancy was because “the CFO” had been using it for commutes. Now, the car had been on the market for just over 3 months per Car Gurus, so this suggested to us immediately that a lot of miles had been put on the vehicle in a short period of time, suggesting it needed more maintenance.

We alert our sales person to our concerns and even show him the photos of the listing on Car Gurus as well as the email from the Athens lot that confirmed the vehicle in stock as listed on the website. He returns from talking to management about these concerns by saying, “there’s nothing we can do.” He indicated that management did not care that our interest in the vehicle was under false pretense as the “listing in the website does have it as an LE.” We then noted that we had been told up by the sales person that the listing on their website also listed the vehicle as having over 6,000 fewer miles (note again that this was on THEIR website, and I have screen shots of this as well, if you are interested). His response was, “we don’t compromise on prices for used vehicles.” The listing does indicate that the vehicle price as “no haggle price,” but again for 6,000 fewer miles than are actually on the vehicle.

We summarized our concerns with the business practice that we were being shown after having commuted over an hour to see a vehicle that ended up being a different model (LE vs advertised XLE) and having more miles than it was listed as having. He indicated that management had told him that there wasn’t anything they could do because it wasn’t their fault that Car Gurus was incorrect or that it had been confirmed to us incorrectly (again, and I cannot emphasize this enough, the listing on their website still had the mileage incorrect and it was still confirmed to us to be a different model). So, if you are looking at vehicle listings from third parties (which is of course common for anyone insterested in comparing prices), then I guess you have to double check their own website to make sure that it is correct. Even then, be sure that YOU check the odometer because their mileage listings don’t seem to be accurate, which is inordinately worrying as a business practice. And, if you don’t want to pay sticker price (i.e., if you’re a reasonable person), then Brinson is not the place for you to shop because they “don’t compromise on used vehicles.” Finally, if Eric Harrison or Demonte Young are managers when you go, then they won’t care enough about your experience to even apologize or make eye contact for misleading you",1.0
4,"January 08, 2019","Service Dept:  many thanks to Bryce Polk and Jason Canady for helping me. Very professional, friendly. We are lifelong Ford Family owners and will continue to be.  Their knowledge and honesty goes a long way.  I appreciate you both! The service cashier lady is so very sweet.",5.0
5,"November 16, 2018","Shouldn't even get one star. Very dishonest business practices.  Bought a vehicle and signed the contract.  The vehicle was left at the dealership to get a few things added to it.  I was told these would be fixed locally, no problem.  When I returned to pick up the vehicle, I realized 602 miles have been added to the odometer.  That's definitely not a local trip.  Everyone within the dealership denies driving the vehicle.  The owner and sales rep both stated the mileage was simply written down incorrectly on the original sales contract and that I was mistaken.  Now I see it's happened to another person and they have customers returning loaner vehicles because they have been sold! Would not ever recommend Brinson Ford.  I also contact Ford directly and filed a formal complaint.  I was also told this isn't the first instance of dishonest business practices and numerous cases were open on Brinson Ford.",1.0
6,"November 11, 2018","******* Warning***********
Brinson Ford
DO NOT BUY FROM THIS DEALESHIP
This Ford dealership in Corsicana Tx. About 50 miles South of Dallas 
They are dishonest company to do business with. 
The mileage stated on the sales agreement Document that we signed and was not what is on the car Odometer which is 2700 more miles. I called the Dealer on Monday and explained the problem and that I would like to talk to the sales Manager. two day later the Sales Rep calls me I explained my grievance with this the car mileage not reflecting the TRUE mileage on the sale agreement. Never Heard back from them after two weeks .

7,"September 06, 2018","The experience with this dealership was a good one. Went to look at a used Nissan. Took time looking over the car, and did the numbers. Agreed on the deal, and bought the car. Aron came to assist me with looking at the car, running the numbers, and completing the purchase. Hassle free. I was in and out of there in a reasonable time without the running back and forth to the manager, and all the usual tricks some dealerships still do. Great purchase, and would do business again.

8,"July 24, 2018","We bought a 2011 diesel truck with 98k miles. We were assured the truck went through their 172 point inspection.  Not 2 months later, we took the truck in because we heard a noise under the left tire. They said the truck was not safe to drive. Really, 2 months later, now they say it will be 3500 dollars to fix. That all the front parts are worn out and unsafe to drive. We paid to have it fixed. Same noise is still there. Now they want us to pay for more work to be done. 
This dealership is not worthy of a single star! Please consider this review when going. We are not rich, can't afford a brand new truck,  and we were looking for a good truck.  Now we have one with lots of problems . Oh, they also said  an older man traded in the truck, garage kept. Wow, they will say anything for a sale! ",1.6
9,"July 18, 2018","Never again will I purchase another vehicle from this shady dealership. You shouldn't have to bring your own mechanic to check over cars they claim they inspect. I have purchased  7 vehicles from this company and at first they did well but they have been going down hill doing and saying anything for a dollar. I bought a used vehicle from them with 100k on mileage, being concerned the dealership assured me vehicle was tip top shape. 3000 dollars later same problem persist. Dealership promised Pastor we will take care of you. If that's taking care of customers I hate see what not taking care of you cost. Best advice shop one these small towns that need your business because these people apparently could care less.

10,"June 26, 2018","I had been looking for a good used vehicle for my son. Called Jason Smith and he was more than happy to give me all the information that I requested on the Toyota Hylander that I ended up buying. He even went above and beyond by driving to another dealership where I was having my truck serviced, picking me up to do the deal and then driving me back to my truck. That right there folks is what you call customer service. That guy gets 5 Stars and 2 Thumbs Up!!! I would definitely recommend this dealership and further more Jason to anyone. Awesome job and thank you! ",5.0

14,"June 05, 2017","I give this dealership 5 stars for effort.  The sales manager Eric went out of his way to get the registration taken care of.  However, the Tech that installed the plates failed to properly secure them and the back plate fell off during transit to my residence.  What a bummer, especially since I waited almost 6 weeks to get them.  Eric came through and went back to the Tax office and got new ones.  He even sent them overnight and I got them from FedEx the next day.  This time they were installed with bolts, nuts and locking washers.   Great job Eric.  Thanks for all your help.",4.8

35,"August 05, 2014","On Friday, June 13th, my 2012 Explorer was disabled and towed to Brinson Ford in Corsicana, TX. The AC break was determined to be the result of a collision a week before and I requested Brinson to repair all the collision damage while it was in their shop. Two weeks later, on June 26th I picked up my Explorer, an eight hour round trip. It was covered with the same bugs it came in with. When I asked to have it washed, the service manager Chris Stevenson said “The insurance company doesn’t  pay me to detail your car” 
I pointed out to service advisor Bryce Polk that the grill had not been repaired and repainted as specified on the appraisal, but I would discuss that with Chris when I was back home. My rental car had been turned in and I was four hours from San Antonio.

Repeated calls to Chris were getting me nowhere. “I’ve got to pull the files.” “That labor charge was to cover things we didn’t get paid enough for.”  “That grill was the lower one we replaced.”
Finally, on July 3rd, Chris agreed to send me a check for the work not done. I tried to call Chris several times the week of the 14th to follow up. Twice we were “cut off”. No luck contacting GM Chet Fowler or either Brinson Owners either. 

On July 22nd I found Amanda Weaver’s name on line and she investigated my problem.
Today, July 31st, I received payment. Amanda was most helpful. Nobody else was.

Final note: McCombs Ford collision shop in San Antonio fixed my Explorer in TWO days, and they detailed it too!

Aron and Charlie were also very respectful of the fact I brought my service dog with me for the buying process.  They were also very appreciative of the fact I served in the Marine Corps and am now disabled.  Hearing people who are appreciative of what others have done, makes the experience even better.

Called their main number and ended up talking with Jason Smith in sales. Had an overall good experience with him. Worked with me to get the deal done smoothly and in a timely manner. Only complaint is I got some pressure to finance it through the dealership instead of my credit union which I already had lined up. Other than that everything went well. The only reason I wouldn't recommend this dealership to family and friends is because of the distance (I bought a car and had it delivered to me 250 or so miles away to my residence).

108,"September 11, 2012","Long story short, Mr Charlie Boch was rude to me after I told him I was not ready to buy that day, I would need to think about the purchase a little long because he could not get my monthly payments down as low as I was comfortable with, which I understand, if you cant you can't. But no need to be rude to your customers when they ask for more time to think about the purchase. Mr Boch actually stated to me ""He doesnt need to beg for a sale, I asked for a good deal and he got me a good deal, take it or leave it."" Then, dispite the rude comment, I asked to see other cars on the lot that may be more of my price range. He then told me he cant get me financied for anything else. It was this or nothing.... I have a credit score of 745... No reason why I should qualify to buy the 2012 Ford Focus we were discussing and not anything else... He just didnt like that I didnt do what he wanted me to do, when he wanted me to do it. I then left after being made to feel unwelcome here.

159,"March 04, 2012","I would recommend this dealership with conditions 1. I don't understand how you sell a $22,000 used truck and then not give them two keys, it happened with both vehicles I purchased 2. I've purchased two vehicles from this dealer and may purchase another, but I will ask for a full tank of gas and make sure I have two keys or I want make the deal.  The first car I purchased, I got about 6 miles when the light began to flash that I was almost out of gas.  The next purchase I asked for at least a half of a tank and when I drove off I had a little over a quarter of a tank.  The two vehicles I traded in had both sets of keys and now I realize I left way to much gas in them.  Josh Avery is a fine man and there were communication errors on my part and others, but all is well.  They have a good service department, it's clean and close to my home.",4.4

161,"February 25, 2012","About 2 weeks ago I went to Brinson Ford to find a used vehicle that I could travel with my family of 6 with. I wanted a truck and after visiting other dealerships it was looking like I couldn't buy what I wanted with my price limit. My dad talked me into stopping anyway just to look. I was able to get a beautiful truck that seats 6. I'm a disabled veteran so my income is limited. Aron and Charlie were super friendly and didn't rush me or try to put me in something I didn't like. I left very satisfied. Unfortunately, 8 days later I got the blinking check engine light and though ""on no I just bought a piece of crap!"" They told us to bring in it and it turns out it was a Ford recall on the fuel injector. It was covered but the catalytic converter became damaged as a result. Ford didn't want to cover that part. Everyone at Brinson Ford has been extremely helpful! I didn't buy the extended warranty so they could have just brushed me off. Today, they gave me a loaner vehicle so that I can still have a way to get around. They are also doing everything possible to make Ford pay for the repairs. The employees here are the best I have ever met. There is no doubt I will be returning for my next vehicle. ",5.0

Although I did not find her a car that night I did spot a used Dodge Ram 1500 Laramie truck. When I got home I got on the internet and got all the details on the truck. I called about it the next day or so and then went down to test drive it. I really liked the truck. Everybody was very helpful in answering my questions. Although I really liked the truck, there was a big spot of something on the carpet on the passenger side almost completely hidden under the dash, but it was enough to make me walk away. Chet was unaware of what I was talking about but said he would get it checked out. It turned out to be nothing major and was easily fixed. Chet even sent me pictures to my cell phone to show how well it had been cleaned up. Long story short, I ended up buying the truck and after owning it a week or so there where a couple of other minor things that popped up and Chet took care of all of them for me. Two years later and thousands of miles on the road and it has been the best vehicle I have ever owned.

I just wanted to thank you and your wonderful staff for a great experience. I teach high school and had to take the day off to purchase a new vehicle so I was very limited on time. I came in and told them exactly what I could afford and listed the vehicles I wanted to look at and the amount I could afford as payment.

Your sales associate Jeremiah was quick to pull the two cars around and take me for test drives. He wasn't pushy at all and very informative. I made my decision and Brian Carter promptly had my financial paperwork ready to go. I walked in, test drove, negotiated and signed paperwork on my new 2007 Camry LE and was back at work in 3 hours time!  This is a miracle!

There were others on your staff that made me comfortable and even bought me a drink since I didn't have change. I believe his name was Eric? Your receptionist was also very helpful and friendly.

Anyways, the experience was great and all of these employees deserve added bonus and recognition for listening to a customer's needs and recognizing my sense of urgency and getting things done. My boss was shocked and pleased when I told him I was done and wouldn't need any additional time off.

John Harvey and I are very pleased with our experience and had it not been for his previous employment there and his recommendation, I might have gone somewhere else. I am glad I listened!

I will definitely recommend Brinson Ford in Athens to anyone looking to buy in the future!

Sincerely,
Tammy Beaty ",5.0

The only thing that may be better...at least for me and other parents who work m-f 8-5 is maybe a small play area for children, like dealership next door :) Saturday is the only days available for me to get oil changes and any maintenance and I have no choice but to bring my children all in all, I am satisfied and would recommend you guys.",3.8

246,"September 27, 2011","I gave it the rating I did because for once I didn't have to hold my old ladies hand in doing something. She did it all by her self. She did it in only a couple of hours and in a time of need. The only complaint I could possibly make is that the sales person took advantage of her gender and would budge not even a dollar on the price and sold her 2 grand worth of extras she really didn't need. But overall I know Brinson treats his customers right, as for the employees they don't have so good and I only say that because it's sad when a regular customer can get a better deal on a car than his employees!",4.6

Had tried several times over the years to deal with Tri-County but got no where.My husband and I had bought all our automibles through Brinso and would not deal any where else.

I then returned  month later bought another truck for my son.

The young man that help me is no longer there.The only thing I found dishonest was the young man convinced me that Ford had insulated there trucks better so that a Black on Black did not get any hotter then a white now.That is part of my dumbness.

Mark's son checked me in but Mark personally let me know what the mechanic was going to do, how long it would take and how much it would cost. The process took a little longer than expected and I talked to Mark about a meeting that I had to attend in Corsicana. The analysis was going to go past my meeting time so Mark let me use a loaner car to get to my meeting. After the meeting I returned to the store to pick up my truck and it was ready to go. Mark even had it washed! All in all a good experience.
