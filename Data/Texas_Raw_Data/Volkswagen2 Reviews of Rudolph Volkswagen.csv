0,"November 16, 2018","Be careful with taking your vehicle to Rudolph Volkswagen for servicing. They bait and switch customers. I called and it was supposed to be minimum service visit, but it turned out that the service rose to minimal to $450 due to some other things they neglected to advise when I scheduled my appointment.

Also, I called for an appointment at 7:30 am, but upon arrival, nothing was setup. So, of course, we have to repeat the process all over again. 

Terrible.  ",1.8
1,"August 08, 2016","Recently bought a 2016 VW at Rudolph Volkswagen and the customer service was, for lack of a better word, perfect!  Staff was extremely helpful and knowledgeable. Brian Lane was exceedingly good and helpful!  You must check out this dealership!  You certainly won't be disappointed! ",5.0
