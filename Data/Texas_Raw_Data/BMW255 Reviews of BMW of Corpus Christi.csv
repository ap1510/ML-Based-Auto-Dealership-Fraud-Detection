1,"December 14, 2019","I purchased a 2008 Jeep Wrangler for my grandson from this dealership the day after Thanksgiving. Two weeks later, my grandson took the jeep to a car shop on the Island where they live  to have the oil changed.  They told him the rear brake pads were worn out to the rotors and the rear axle seals were leaking very bad.  It's hard to believe the BMW service department didn't notice this! Either they knew it and didn't tell us or they didn't notice it.  Either way, it doesn't look good for the service department or the sales department.  I called the dealership and asked them if they could fix these problems since we've only owned the Jeep two weeks.  The salesman who sold me the car, Danny told me he didn't think so but would ask his GM.  He called me back the next day and said they will not pay on any of the repairs since the Jeep had a lot of miles on it but would ""make me a good deal if I had the repairs done there at the BMW dealership.""   I felt like if the screwed me over once on the sale, they would probably do it again on the service so I took it somewhere else.  I won't be going back to BMW of Corpus Christi for anything. ",1.6
2,"July 22, 2019","We just purchased a BMW from BMW of Corpus Christi.  Johnny ""Rocket"" Almaguer did an incredible job for us.  He matched us up with the perfect vehicle and worked with us until the price was just right.  His clear explanation of all the many bells and whistles was so beneficial.  I would highly recommend Johnny and this dealership without reservation.",5.0

4,"May 18, 2019","Buyer beware!
BMW of Corpus Christi sold my ASE certified mechanic a waterpump that I paid $607 for. Including labor I spent $891.66! 
Said to have a 2 year warranty failed in 12 months. After 5 months of no one at the dealship available to assist me or to bother returning my calls, they failed to honor their warranty unless I towed my car to them and had their mechanics verify the failure (Apparently they are the only people with qualifications to put on a water pump lol) all at my expense, I had already had the pump replaced at my expense. I'll NEVER buy another part or car from them! They had no problem selling me 3 BMW's. 
This dealship is run by Princple Auto, they have no Principles. Do yourself a favor, buy a Benz! ",1.0

43,"April 27, 2018","I can't say enough THANK YOU's to Jericho Murillo (Service Manager) for assisting my parents with their BMW repairs.   I can tell that Jericho is passionate about giving that extra level of customer service.  My folks live in an Assisted Living facility and have limited access to transportation when their car is out of service.  Jericho offered to go down to their home and take a look at the car, and if needed take it back to the dealership for repairs.   The car was taken to your garage, and you guys did a stellar job of repairing.  After the completion of the work, Jericho returned the car.  This is a huge help for me and my parents.  They didn't have to worry at all and didn't have to make extra efforts to get the car repaired.   This was a tribute to Jericho's leadership and willingness to go that EXTRA MILE.

Thank you again Jericho!

65,"April 18, 2018","I recently had to take my BMW in for service and visited the BMW center of Corpus Christi. I approached a service center employee who directed me to go and wait inside and that someone would be right with me. Twenty minutes later I had to initiate with the same service center employee if someone could help me. He informed me that I was going to need to order the part that I had a question about and I proceeded to the parts counter and ordered the part. I then scheduled my BMW for service two days later. I took my car in at the scheduled time and was told that I would receive a call later detailing what I would need to have done along with replacing my broken accessory. I did receive a call later that afternoon which detailed what I was going to need to have done to my car. I approved the repairs and was told that my car would be ready the following afternoon by 1:00pm. At 1:30pm, I called the service center to speak with my service representative, but just got his voicemail, I left him a message to return my call. I then called the Service Manager to check the status of my vehicle, but it too went to voicemail. I then left him a message to call me. About an hour later I called to speak with the General Manager, and I again was sent to voicemail. After two hours later, I received a call from the Service Manager who said he was following up on a note from my service representative from the previous day, not that he was returning my call from his voicemail. I was then informed that my car was ready for pick-up.
Apparently, the General Manager is not to concerned with his customers, as it has now been four days and he has yet to return my call. It is also apparent he is not concerned with the level of service that his customer service department is providing.
I have had my car serviced in Houston and in Austin and it is apparent that these dealerships know how to take care of their customers.
BMW center of Corpus Christi service is poor at best.

237,"January 07, 2018","I took my car to change oil about 2 months back. Since then, I have had oil leaking. The smell of burnt oil dripping on what I would assume is the exhaust. I do not know if perhaps they did not tighten oil plug tight enough or what. I have not called to complain because I feel they will just say that they did not do it. I will take car back for next oil change and let them know what I experienced. I will be writing another review on what happens next. ",3.0

244,"January 24, 2017","I have bought many BMW vehicles over the last fifteen years.  BMW of Corpus Christi is my dealer of choice.  They have become like family to me by earning my trust from the very first deal.  Mike Terazas was my salesman for over ten of those years and he is now the new car manager.  He never steered me wrong and always found a way to make the deal work.  Mike has passed the torch to an equally competent and hard working salesman, James Garza, with whom I've purchased two BMW's in the last eighteen months with the same no pressure, low stress enjoyable experiences I am used to.  Besides the top notch treatment I receive from the sales department, I get fantastic treatment every time I need any service on my vehicles.

Mike Terrazos who is currently the BMW sales manager, deservedly so, sold me my last three cars.  The man know his merchandise.  He is not the typical high pressure sales person.  He is patient in explaining all you need to know and treats you like a friend, not a customer.  Mike should be the prototype and BMW should make a mold of Mike for all that work for them.

It is obvious from the amount of vehicles I have purchased that each and every experience has been on point. Fantastic customer service...they put the customers need and wants as their number one priority. I have gone to other dealerships and have been forced to play the 'car buying game.' BMW of CC doesn't play that game. Mike Terrazas is by far the best. He is number one when it comes to absolutely anything. I won't go to anyone else. Fantastic!!,5.0

The following day I received a phone call that my car was ready.  Again, I pulled into the service lot and was greeted by name.  My car was brought to me within minutes, and in addition to the services rendered, the car was cleaned by the dealership.

254,"November 24, 2015","Horrible experience.  Cannot recommend strongly enough how disgusted I am with this dealership.  Took my 2012 BMW 550 with 48,000 miles back in again for running issues that started after this dealer preformed the ccp recall.  Somehow, the car has 4 bent wheels, and a defective steering wheel.  My rear 1/4 panel was damaged while at BMW of cc, and they drilled a large hole in my car to ""repair"" the dent.  I did not authorize or consent to any body work being done to my car.  They once again ""cannot find"" or identify the running problem, although anyone not employed by BMW seems to be able to.  Car still runs rough and there are common problems that they refuse to look into.  They even let the shop forman take my car home for the night.  I'm not sure what special vehicle repair facilities he has at home, but I didn't authorize him to drive my car home!  My car was returned out of gas after the foreman's outing with additional damage to two areas of he front fender.

The dealer refuses to do the right thing and compensate me for the damage they caused and the diminished value of my vehicle.  So I now have a 2012 BMW 550 that is damaged and has a diminished value.  

 Only give them one star because I cannot give the 0 stars.  

If I can add photos, please let me know how.  ",1.4
