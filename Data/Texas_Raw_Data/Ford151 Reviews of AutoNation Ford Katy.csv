0,"June 12, 2020","If I could give this dealership a zero star rating that is what I would do. I bought a Ford F150 from AutoNation Ford in Katy TX. I was lied too by the salesman, sales manager, and finance department. They will lie straight to your face and say anything to sell a car. I went to the dealership yesterday and spoke to a finance manager. He told me he couldn't help me. I called the dealership today this time asking for a sales manager. They transferred me then the the line lost connection. Was it intentional? Maybe it was an accident. I called them back and let the lady know they hung up on me. She apologized then transferred me straight to the sales managers voice mail. I left a voice mail but he never called me back. I guess that is how management services the dealerships customers. These guys will explain while misinterpreting the sales and finance documents to you. Once you sign your screwed. The dealership made its sale. They got what they wanted now they are done with you. I'll updated my post later just to let everyone know how this all turns out.

Never have I ever experience such rudeness from a service center.  We have brought in the car several times with the same problem. The ac blows through the defroster and they don't seem to figure out how to fix the problem.  My daughter purchase the extra warranty to cover rentals.  When we brought it in it was doing the same thing.  Our advisor witnessed it.  Then after having the car for four days they said it wasn't doing it and could not fix the problem.  Therefore they wanted us to pay $30 a day for the rental.  I said it isn't our fault that they can't fix it and we have to keep bringing it back.  I refused to pay for the rental since she purchased extra to have this in her policy.  The service manager Henry S. insisted we pay it. I said it is not our fault you can't fix the problem.  He was extremely rude to me and my daughter and to our advisor.  Henry S. the service manager said we can never bring the car back to him to fix it. We were banded from coming back.  I have never experienced such rudeness and inadequacy to fix a problem we have been dealing with several times.  I asked for his business card and he said he didn't care if I reported him.  He said, ""Go ahead""  My son was thinking of purchasing a car from this dealership.  This will not be happening.  This service manager doesn't even deserve one star.  I feel badly of how he treats his workers in front of the customer.  I do not know how the dealership puts us with such behavior.  Total thumbs down to the service department at AutoNation Katy!!!!  Especially the service manager Henry S. one of the rudest people I have encountered.  I only gave it a one star because I had to for it to allow me to post!!!  Otherwise I would have chosen none.",1.0

4,"March 18, 2020","We elected a truck online and had our 2011 F-150 appraise online.  we had received a conditional offer on our used vehicle and a $500 coupon just for selling it to ford...the new truck internet offer showed discounts from Ford and the Dealership; and below that was an incentive to another $1000 if financed through dealership (no small print that we could find about exclusions)...Well when we got there the new truck was waiting for a test drive which was fine.  Next, they decided to reappraise our trade-in F-150..The salesman of course apologized for having to do some back and forth with his manager (bull!)...When it was done our original online offer was much less ""because"" and the $500 coupon not included...we finally agreed to get the coupon back...Meeting with the finance manger resulted in not getting our additional $1000 rebate which we didn't discover until home with the new truck.  After an email with them (attached below)...manager ""explained"" that the $1000 rebate for financing was only if you ""negated"" other rebates already included...that is bull!...I feel that we got taken for about $800 on the trade in and $1000 on the advertised financing ploy.  These guys then begged to get us to change our less than ""5"" perfect rating to a ""%"" because they would get punished by Ford...What garbage...

My letter to dealer: Thanks you for taking care of us Saturday, even though we understood your wife was having issues and you wanted to be with her.  You were a caring salesman for us.  Having said that and not commenting on anything attributable to you, I have now carefully reviewed “the deal” and find that we were not treated fairly by the appraisers in doing the math on the trade in and secondly did not get $1000 credit for financing when we did the paperwork with Mike Lopez.

On the second issue: I have a phone message in to Mike Lopez, that when I reviewed carefully the purchase agreement, the $1000 credit was not included for financing the truck. This was carefully explained to him when we sat down and it didn’t show in the paperwork.  II is clearly explained on the internet for deals on new Ford F-150 Lariat models.

The first issue to which I will include the emails form Ford and your dealership for my trade in, seemed like either the appraisers didn’t know what they had in front of them on my offer or tried to take advantage, especially when I wanted the $500 coupon from an email that I had received. So - firstly with that deal - we were offered an extra $500 for just selfing the truck to Autonation (that part we finally were granted).  The original offers were $13,500 on both offers -the one you brought to us from the appraisers had the accident noted (-$500) and the paint dings(-$500 originally and the adjusted to between $200-300), they then added on tires -$623, and detailing -$89) and somehow came up with $12000 and then gave me the $500 for the “free coupon offer”.  Using my math they should have started at $13,500 and added $500 coupon = $14,000, then subtracted tires and detailing ($623 + $89), and the accident and paint chips were already accounted for)…somewhere $13,288 - $13,388. so the difference that we we not given on this is approximately $788-$888.

I felt that things were pushed back and forth to us very quickly and I didn’t really have time to review what was going on.  If there is anything that you can do about this, I would appreciate it.  If you cannot I will expect to discuss with Mike Lopez and then the Genral Manager, and if necessary beyond that.  From my estimate we were taken for an additional $1800 on the deal considering being shorted the trade in and not getting the financing bonus.

That night (3 hours later) they text me the truck is being sold. What kind of trashy dealership does that.   Autonationfordkaty does.  Just crappy.  Beware of this place. Not trustworthy.  ,1.0
6,"February 20, 2020","DO NOT TAKE YOUR CAR HERE FOR AUTOMOTIVE REPAIRS!!  My 2008 Ford Focus, that I bought from AutoNation Ford Katy, was not starting.  So, I took it to them to repair.  They replaced the PCM for $1,600 but the check engine light came on after it was completed.  I asked them to tell me why and all they could do was tell me, ""it's $140 to check it.""  I called the GM Ryan Lakowski 4 times, their corporate customer care 6 times, and one email.  After 3 months, the service manager tells me he won't look at my car even after I tell him I bought 3 cars from them.  They're ready to sell you car but customer loyalty means nothing to them unless you're will to spend money and then the money means more than the customer.  I contacted BBB and Ryan wrote (never a call) back lies about me wanting free repairs.  All I wanted was for them to check my car again and tell why the check engine came on.

8,"February 08, 2020","I DEFINITELY DO NOT recommend this dealership at all. I had to service my 2006 Ford Escape Hybrid, which Mike Ouida wanted more money from me. This service advisor is such a rude person who also lied about the cost of my service parts. Mike forced me to pay more in service fees, which is stupid and ridiculous! Mike Ouida wants money from customers, which he rips off people with extra unnecessary car services. Also, Mike Ouida never called me about the status of my vehicle. I had to call him multiple times to get a reach of him, which he never answered me. Never go back to this dealer and NEVER see him. It is a waste of time and money getting my vehicle serviced!

9,"January 16, 2020","the sale process was great. no issues there thanks Matt. however i guess i just got the cracked egg in the dozen. 9 days after buying, the engine head needed to be replaced! yeah that circumstance hurt because i just missed the cut off for the buy back! but i tell you, there has been zero and i  mean zero compassion from the staff, cold callus and as a matter of fact. i brought the vehicle in and no one has called me i have been doing all the calling, i had to call and find out my vehicle had to be services at the jeep and dodge service department.  i have been calling the extended warranty company  myself. only to find neither service department has called in the claim, i did!  my part is on back order and no ETA on when it will be available. i was put in a rental i asked i could be put into something more comfortable and no  response.  its one thing to get the cracked egg, another to find its rotten and another when the person that sold it you doesn't give to pennies about your overall customer experience. while my issue may be unique to me great customer service should be universal. showing compassion  doesn't mean you did something wrong it means you care and put your customers at the center of everything you do!  nothing will change the content of my circumstance and that is accepting the things i cannot change and the wisdom to know the difference. just the lack of concern or even thought hurts. people buy cars because they need them and it sucks to have traded in one for one you dont have and dont know when you will get back",1.0
10,"October 24, 2019",If you’re reading this I’m guessing it’s not the first negative review you’ve come across for autonationfordkaty. At some point the specifics no longer matter. My experience follows the same path as countless others. My difference is I heard the service writer the first time and followed his advice. “Get some other Ford dealer to look at the problem.” My truck is 4 days old and I purchased it at AutoNation Ford of Katy. I bought a 2014 Super Duty @ AutoNation Ford Gulf Freeway - Houston. There is not much difference between the two.,1.0

14,"July 01, 2019","I called AutoNation Ford Katy to schedule a complete DETAIL job on my Ford F350 Super Duty King Ranch truck.  I discussed other Detail Shops in the Katy/Houston area with the service advisor, but I trusted AutoNation Katy to do a better job on my truck, especially the King Ranch leather seats and the fact that their detail shop is very familiar with Fords.  They did charge less than the other detail shops, but when I went to pick up my truck I realized why!  All I got for $113.00 was a glorified wash job!  My truck looked horrible!  Absolutely nothing was done to the Pueblo Gold trim on the wheelwells, the bumper, the side mirrors and the running boards.  The leather seats and leather trim had been wiped off, but no conditioner had been applied.  They didn't even spray any air freshener inside the truck.   There was still sand and dirt on the chrome exhaust pipes, mud spots on the paint and dirty window casings on both sides and the rear sliding window.  There were even bird droppings all over the truck from where they parked it under a tree!

I took 24 pictures of the interior and exterior of my truck, so it would be documented.

I have purchased two vehicles from them in the past, but no more!  I will NEVER go back to this dealership for anything! 

Two of my grandsons and I spent over 4 hours  on my truck AFTER I got it home doing what they were paid to do, but didn't!",1.4
15,"May 22, 2019","The price of the F150 I purchased was very good. The vehicle was as described except for some dealer add-ons that weren't shown anyplace on the website or sticker.  The car was totally ready to go at the time we set for pickup. The pickup process and the explaining of the features was quick and painless. The staff was polite and prompt.  I greatly appreciated all these things. 

BUT, it took a lot of work to merely pay the advertised price of the vehicle. The experience was full of the worst things car dealers routinely do...  you're told a price and it changes. Constantly. At first you 'qualify' for everything and then that rebate you were going to get disappears (even after asking explicitly if a certain rebate would apply at the very start and being told yes). You agree on a price (yes, you can negotiate) and then there are add-ons  to the price of the vehicle (tint insurance? Haha.). Dealer add-ons should appear on the website, IMHO so they aren't a surprise. Negotiate those out of the price of the car. The total price of the car should actually be a TOTAL. You are told there are no other fees for the vehicle except for tag, title, tax. Then more fees magically appear on the purchase order. Our purchase order had to be corrected maybe 4-5 times and somehow the 'errors' were never in our favor. Imagine that. If the sales rep tells you there is not a dealer documentation fee (or that he doesn't know if there is one)- he is lying, so negotiate your price accordingly.  I recommend doing everything via phone and email. This will allow you to skip the hard sell on warranties and other junk you don't want or need . Test drive the same type car elsewhere. Then work on price, and secure your financing at your own bank or credit union. Bring a check, pick up the car, ask your questions and go. If you do that, it's an ok experience. If you're willing to eat a few hundred bucks of dealer fees and another almost 1K in add ons, then you can go the no-haggle route. I can't comment on that because I didn't go that route. I suspect it would have been a fine process. ",3.2

18,"February 18, 2019","We had an employee drop off a company vehicle to be serviced. Spent $700 on a 16k mile vehicle somehow. Had issues with vehicle warning lights. Took it back to a novice of a Service Advisor that had no clue what the light even meant or where the problem could be located. Picked up the vehicle and AirPods and a portable battery pack were stolen. Roughly $230 worth of merchandise. Service Advisor continued to say things would be made right. Only to receive word after 3-4 weeks that we would not be reimbursed “CITING LACK OF PREVIOUS ISSUES IN THIS REGARD, AND POLICY STATING WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ITEMS LEFT IN VEHCILES.” 

We are the rare case that something was stolen while the vehicle was in your possession? Hard to believe. Not responsible for items left in vehicles? So I take it you don’t care if your employees steal from paying customers? It’s just easiest to say we are not responsible? Poor management and customer service.",1.0

Ford is going downhill big time. I am going to get rid of the xxx Ford and never buy Ford again. Oh and one more thing. Last time I had an oil change they said my battery was leaking and the terminals needed to be replaced. Well that was a complete lie. I contacted NTB where I purchased the battery and had a warranty. The battery was NOT leaking it had a weak charge from the terminal corrosion. All they could do is clean up the terminals and connection because you cannot replace those types of terminals. You have to replace the main harness which is a bigger job. So Autonation Ford service donkeys were lying and trying to bilk me for $175 plus tax. Way to look out for your customers.

27,"June 21, 2018","THIS IS NOT AN HONEST USED CAR DEALERSHIP. 

I had looked for a 4-door truck for a while to accommodate my growing family. I found a truck that was a little bit less than the rest, maybe by a few hundred dollars or so. Was not really excited to got the no haggle route and I was right. I live 2 hours ago and decided to check it out. I ended up buying the truck and am happy with it but after footing a few repairs I pretty much came out even or a little behind had I had an honest dealership. 

Auto Nation is another group of slick salesmen that will do anything but give you the truth and a straight answer. 

I asked Amine my salesman and his manager Sam at least 3 times about the condition of the brakes and was assured that they were in great shape. They kept dodging the actual question and tell me the it meets safety standards. I should have walked out then. I had my son with me and was distracted. I should have returned the truck but I got stuck with this truck because life got in the way of me returning.

One should not have to get their brakes changed less than a thousand miles after purchase. 

These folks are questionable. They are question dodgers. I will not even bother to look of my next vehicle if it is here.

28,"June 06, 2018","I brought my truck today for oil change and tire rotation as part of maintenance. After 1 1/2 hour of waiting, the staff said that the services I came for is finish. Believing that the oil change and tire rotation was done, I paid the corresponding fee for the services rendered. To my dismay, when I cheked my vehicle, I knew for a fact that the tire rotation was NOT DONE! The reason for me to know this is because I had a scratch mark on the RIGHT REAR tire which is very distinct from the other tires. If the tires were indeed rotated, the said tire with the scratch mark on it would have been rotated in the front wheels.  I went to talk to the manager about the observation that I had, after a few minutes of inspection he said he will have the tire rotation done again. No apologies and no explanations were given as to what happen to the tire rotation and I wasted another 30 minutes waiting for it to be done. Is it not called DISHONESTY on the part of your staff? Customers come in and pay for the services they need believing it would be done, putting our complete trust in your company.

30,"June 01, 2018","By far the worst service I have ever received in my life. Not an exaggeration, not just referring to vehicle related customer service...the ABSOLUTE worst service imaginable. The service center manager literally told me he did not care about my truck repairs and has the most condescending attitude toward customers. I had to see a salesman to help me convince the service managers to even talk to me. And to be very clear, this is truly a management issue. The service reps I talked to were decent and I witnessed how rude the manager was to them. How those service reps haven't found somewhere else to work is beyond me. 
Fast forward a few months. I need an oil change and I signed up for a PREPAID service plan when I bought the truck. There isn't another AutoNation dealership near me so what do I do? I make an appointment online and hope that the horrible experience from before was a one time thing. No such luck. (My fiancé took my truck in for me because I couldn't manage to get time away from work to handle this myself.) He stands in front of a service rep for 5 minutes before the rep even looks up to acknowledge him. Bless the fiancé, he's not even upset yet. But then he stands around for another 5 minutes while the rep fills out the paperwork for the oil change. Only then does the rep say, ""By the way, they just came and told me it's a 3 to 4 hour wait for an oil change"".  Would you not start off with this? Would you not mention this online when asking if you intend to wait for service or drop off? What's the point of an appointment? (I also dealt with this same appointment nonsense when I originally brought my truck in for repairs but this seems the most insignificant complaint of that particular debacle...). Long story short, my fiancé is basically told too bad, so sad.

I don't want to have to take my truck across town for maintenance. I don't want to have to pay a random shop nearby for service I already paid AutoNation for. I don't think it's too much to ask that this dealership get it's act together and remember they are here to help customers. The worst part is that there is no sense of accountability. Management couldn't give a care and apparently they answer to no one. I have been strictly a Ford customer since 2007 (4 vehicles total, 3 of those new) and an AutoNation customer since 2012. NEVER AGAIN. My first experience with an AutoNation Ford was so great that I went straight to AutoNation Ford for my next purchase but clearly, their standards have gone out the window.",1.5
31,"May 23, 2018","The service department is incompetent. I found them to be lazy and unwilling to go the extra mile for a customer. It was obvious that the service desk and service manager are used to handling upset customers because they seemed to have all the answers to get rid of me without having to do the required work on my vehicle even with a generous time allotment. 
The sales manager was more understanding but not helpful. He seemed surprised when I told him that I would not purchase another Ford again due to service related issues. Simply put, this dealership gives Ford a poor image. I let them know that I would place a negative review online for them and they told me “go ahead”. I guess they don’t care. Use the service department at your own risk.

34,"February 07, 2018","Their used car manager is dishonest and they did not keep their customer ""Pledge"". It was just one of many issues. They insinuated that I caused bumper damage and that this is my responsibility! 

This was absolutely preexisting damage that was not identified by anyone in your body shop or dealership. By not identifying this issue doesn't default to the conclusion that the customer must have caused it.

I have invested in two car rentals and driven almost 400 miles to get my purchase to reflect the condition of what I expected of a Ford CPO. This after getting delivery of the car in the condition of an auction vehicle, I had to correct the sloppy dealership detail work with a professional detail service. And the clincher is that Sam had the nerve to deduct $5 from the reimbursement check because it was a credit card surcharge? Unbelievable!

As I stated before, I wanted to return this vehicle before due to the vehicle dirty condition from the dealership and poor maintenance by the previous owner. There were dents on the hood and front grill, paint gouge on the side door, stains on the seats, missing floor mats, unwashed interior, stains on the sun visor, scratches on the interior, chipped windshield. Not what you would expect from a Ford certified preowned. I was instructed by Maria, their finance officer who prepared my contract, that my vehicle return window from their 5 day Pledge was based on taking possession of the vehicle and not the contract signing date. Shady Sam, the used car manager, informed me the complete opposite.

My wife witnessed the contract signing and validated that Maria made that official dealership statement to me. That the finance officer miscommunicated is not a legitimate excuse, it is just another in a long list of broken promises. This even makes me call into question the legitimacy of the CPO certification process of my vehicle.

I will communicate my concerns directly to Ford, since they think they've done their due diligence in addressing my concerns. What they have done successfully is made me feel like a criminal instead of a valued customer. ",1.0
35,"February 03, 2018","My husband was really interested in a fairly new car (Acura with 11,995 miles). He drove the vehicle to be inspected by a local mechanic. The mechanic found an issue with the vehicle and advised my husband to have the dealership fix it, before buying. My husband, still optimistic, returned the car to the dealership and raised his concern to the salesman and his manager. The manager came out to inspect the car and did not deny my husbands concern, and felt that because the car was under warranty, that he should still consider buying it. My husband did not want to buy something that was broken, and then have to go through warranty to fix it. He asked that the dealership fix it or submit the warranty themselves before selling. 

When my husband was repeatedly questioned, he replied with “I don’t feel comfortable buying something that I know I will have to submit to warranty to fix..would you?” 

The salesman’s managers response to that was: I’ll buy whatever I want...Then walked away

The salsperson, Frank, was great. His boss on the other hand, needs to learn to not take things personal. My husband had valid concerns and asked if they could be fixed, which is a fair ask when buying a $24,000 vehicle. If the manager offered to help us find another vehicle, or have his mechanic look at the car again, or even explain to my husband that he did not agree, while remaining respectful, then i would not be writing this review. 

This behavior was completely unprofessional, especially since we already agreed on a fixed interest rate and accepted the sticker price. We were so close to buying and are now pretty bummed.

Note: I have proof of the price and APR % that was offered, signed by my husband after running a soft credit inquiry.

36,"January 17, 2018","Note: This is an update to my previous review posted below. 

In short: Do not go to AutoNation Ford Katy unless you want to sell your dignity, honor and self-respect. 

Here is why:
I bought my 2018 F150 from AutoNation Ford Katy back in Dec 2017. The salesman there who helped with my internet query was Brandon. I could not tell more good things about him until I had realized what exactly he wanted me to do afterwards. 

Basically, before driving off the truck from the dealership, Brandon told me that I will be receiving a survey from the dealership, and I should fill it in, and then call him so that he can provide me a full gas tank for the favor. Well, the survey did come in the email, and I provided the response with truth i.e., The sale experience was good, but there was a long wait for the finance to take me, the facility was not good as there was no children's room, the bathrooms were dirty etc. 

Next day, I texted Brandon to claim the full gas tank - he said it takes a couple of days and he would call back. He didn't call me back, so I decided to text him again. He called be after an hour or so and completely lost it. He was totally unprofessional in his communication and told me that I had let him down by not giving him and the dealership all 5 stars. I told him whatever the truth was, and I don't appreciate his tone of voice. He said I wouldn't be getting the free gas tank; and hung up. I was in a rush at the time of the call, and didn't care much about someone whining. But, as I left the house, I realized what he actually meant by it. Basically, he was asking me to LIE to the survey and give him and his dealership a 5 stars. At that point, I texted him again. You can see the text conversation attached, and judge for yourself. His way of dealing with his customers (now that the sale was completed) is totally unnecessary. His ask from me to lie on the survey for the sake of getting a 100% was totally unethical. I wouldn't sell my soul, honesty, dignity and self-respect just for free gas of tank. Hope you will do the same, and not go to this dealership.


Old Review:
I had a great experience with AutoNation Ford. Brandon is great, he took time to explain several different trim levels and differences. He was very competitive with pricing and compare with few other options that I brought to his attention. Without Brandon, I probably would be end up with a different dealership. I would recommend Brandon and the team to anyone for new cars.",1.0
37,"December 23, 2017","Now I understand why they have an F with the better business bureau!

Service department unfortunately just is awful. 8:15 appointment and took 6 hours. Solution, two pieces of tape. 

Here is the big issue--- First you set an appointment, only to have the service guy toy with you about what time it will be done. When I said I'd wait for it, i was given attitude. Then both the mechanic and service guy were bad mouthing me in my truck, not knowing my cameras were recording. To top it off, someone was upset because they couldn't get into my center console. Why you need to get into my center console to fix my driver side window, you tell me-

To top it off, both the service guy and mechanic went for a drive in my truck. The service guy has absolutely no reason to be in a vehicle. As a matter of fact, he's not allowed according to autonation ford. And when they notice the camera, they unplug it.

41,"November 21, 2017","Brought my Ford F350 there after it was broken into. Dashboard was broken, window, tint and the peddles. When I was filling out the paper work I told them not to repair the vehicle since my company has it's own mechanic. It took them 4 weeks!!! for a broken dashboard and the throttle pedals to be estimated for our insurance company. In the meantime I have told them that I did not want it repaired. Finally they got things together for the insurance company.  I did tell them 3 times at least and also told our insurance company that we are not going to do the repairs at their dealership. They repaired anyway at triple the cost of our own mechanic. Of course releasing the vehicle upon paying the additional $1,500.00 we could have saved by having our own mechanic doing the work.  Be careful because I heard another family complaining about the same actions while I was there waiting for the service person to arrive from lunch. It appears to be part of their business model to do that to clients. Where I just asked which part of not repairing my truck did you not understand??????!! Last time I set foot in that dealership.

I carried truck Automation Katy with me to look at new trucks and asked the salesman to get an  appraisal performed while we looked at cars. I had to leave before the appraisal was ready, the salesman agreed to call later with the value.  Three days later I got a value of 23K, all is good.  I return a few days and select a 2018 F150.  As western the  writing the offer up the salesman informs me  my truck value is 21.2K after his folks have looked at it.

The jist of this tale is he told me one value and then tried to drop it almost 2K  as we are going to the finance guy.

44,"August 12, 2017","Every step of the car buying process was ridiculous with this dealership. The only positive thing they had going for them was they had the exact car I wanted. Emailed the salesman and he never returned emails. Went in to purchase and they tried to tell me their low price was only if I took their financing - not true, it was from a Ford and dealer rebate. I felt lied to every step of the way. Finally purchased the car and when I went to pick it up, the salesman didn't know how to do something as simple as pair my phone to the car. My dad had to sit in the backseat looking at YouTube videos to tell the salesman what to do. There was also a paint chip in the car that they couldn't fix at the time because the person that does that wasn't there. So I had to take the car back the next week. Salesman told me what time to bring him the car to get it fixed and when I showed up at that time, he wasn't there yet, so I had to sit around and wait for him. I also told him I wanted the windows tinted and had been given a price when I bought the car to bring it back for tinting. Well they didn't want to honor that and  my salesman told me I was making it up even though I had proof. Took nearly 5 hours to get my windows tinted so I sat at the dealership for more than 6 hours total without so much as an offer for a loaner. Then I get a call to come to the service dept to get my plates. I show up and am told they don't have them and I need to go to the used car building to track them down. So I had to go find my plates and then bring them back to the service dept for them to install them. The whole process has been one big nightmare.

The individual I worked with was actually very polite, but I told him specifically.... All I need is an oil change.  The waiting area was very sterile and discomforting.  The setup was horrific as you have to walk by all these people who are only interested in what they are doing.  I hated every moment of being there!

The vehicle said I had 1600 miles to the next oil change on the computer when I got home and looked at that, so I knew they didn't do the claimed oil change before they sold me my vehicle.  I was going to just accept they'd gotten me on that and take care of it myself, when I got a call I had to drive the 45 minutes to an hour back to let them do the emissions inspection that wasn't done before they sold the vehicle to me (or had expired and they had to do it again).  So I decided to ask for my oil change, and they agreed.  I made an appointment, brought it in, and they put new oil in the vehicle, but couldn't change the filter because they didn't have the right tool in their shop.  I kid you not.  That means the new oil is ruined, you have to change the filter at the same time you do new oil.  But even better - they put on the second page of the paperwork that they diagnosed an oil leak from the engine.  They didn't tell me about this since I'm sure they knew it was leaking when they sold the vehicle to me, but sold it to me anyway.  I call my salesman Ahmed and he tells me, take it to your mechanic, it's yours.

The sales person Kalil seemed very nice and ready to work with me even though my credit wasn't great. He showed me a 2013 Dodge Charger but only the inside of it because it was close to the end of the day and it was dark. At first he made up some excuse saying it was locked up and all techs were gone. That should have been my warning. So the deal was made but the car wasn't ready because they said they were doing body work and wanted to make sure the paint dried and no damage would be made from it not being dry. Then when I made my finally down payment it still wasn't ready and I was told two different things. 1st work was still being done and 2nd it was just locked up already and the tech had left. So when it finally came time for me to pick up my car I was so excited that I just hoped in and took off and the next day I noticed a huge dent on the side of the car on the passenger side. I was floored I immediately called my sales person back and left a message and he never called back. So I called the manger a few days later and he told me to bring it in. I haven't even had the car a week and a knocking sound came from below the car to. I couldn't believe it. I understand it's a used car and things happen but not even a week of having it something happens. Then when I came in to drop it off my salesperson Kalil was so rude and told me that he didn't have to make the deal with me. He said they had to work so hard on getting me a deal. He got loud with me and my son eight year old son was with me. He said it was my fault because I was rushing them and even was throwing his hands up at me. I was told it that they didn't have the key and so yes I was rushing it because I felt like I was being fed lies. This was not professional at all. I did not raise my voice at him.

58,"November 22, 2016","I bought a 2013 F150 from auto Nation Ford Katy in May of 2015. First off, when you purchase a certified pre-owned vehicle one of the ""perks"" is a new air filter, fresh oil change and a tank of gas. Getting the truck home that day i noticed the air filter was almost black (Should be white, in case you didn't know that), the oil was burnt and I was given half a tank of gas. At the time I didn't know about these advertised perks, so I didn't complain, but the oil did upset me, I took it back and asked for the oil change that should have happened, They assured me, despite what the oil looked like (Cause only They know about cars, no one else) that it had been changed. Long story short, someone reset the oil meter to read new, and the old oil was left in there, TWICE. Third party oil change.

Strike 1

Next, I find oil leaking on my brand new drive way, from my new truck, I crawl under and locate the leak and return to the dealer.I was told i would not be getting a rental or loaner despite it being advertised one would be provided with a certified pre-owned vehicle because ""I was bringing the truck back too soon"" I eventually got a loaner after a lot of yelling and a spike in my blood pressure. What followed was THREE separate trips to the dealer to get the same leak fixed. They kept returning the vehicle to me, insisting there wasn't a leak. Third times a charm and suddenly I had an oil leak and they needed to repair it. (Gasp!) 

Strike 2!

Several months later, my passenger window wouldn't work. Took two trips to the dealer because they ""couldn't find the fault so they couldn't repair it"". Second trip it was repaired, after again, I got frustrated and told them it was a ridiculous excuse to give. Window motor was replaced on the second trip and to everyone's surprise the window magically began to work again!

Mulligan!

So here we are, almost a year later from that time and my truck is experiencing what sounds like metal pipes rolling around in the bed when you go over bumps, back into an uneven surface or basically vertically move the truck at all. Auto Nation Ford Katy had my truck for 16 days, in this time I spoke with and test drove the truck with Tom McGee, who heard this sound and acknowledged it. John at the collision center who heard this also and informed me that I had chassis damage somewhere and that it was difficult to locate and that's why it was taking so long. I was assured all the proper tests and work was being done, from torquing down bolts and greasing random spots, to... torquing down the same bolts from before and re-greasing the same spots again! just in case, the first time it didn't fix the problem cheaply enough, maybe the second time it would. Last night (11/21/16) i got a call from Tom McGee demanding that i come pick up my truck and return the loaner or i would be charged, he said my truck was ready, they weren't going to do anything else and no repairs would be made. Contradicting what John over at the Collision Center told me just two days prior. Oddly enough, the service center couldn't speak for the Collision Center, and vice versa because they were ""separate entities"", but it appears in this case one can speak for the other.  I asked who's decision this was and he said ""Big Boss Hunter"" I asked to have this ""Big Boss Hunter"" call and speak with me, because surely a man who is endowed with such a prestigious title from his peers and subjects would be an honorable man and discuss our issues like gentlemen, right? Well guess what folks? No reply. Apparently Kin...err, Big Boss Man Hunter was too busy tending to his paying customers to deal with warranty people. After all, the scams already been run on me, no reason to continue wasting time, and time is money.I agreed to pick the truck up with a statement in writing saying they indeed heard a noise and felt abnormal vibrations coming from the truck, but despite this, Auto Nation Ford Katy would not be performing any repairs as per the warranty that I (clearly overpaid) for.I was speaking to Abigail Martinez, another ""manager"" at Auto Nation Ford Katy who has the word ""Customer Service"" in her job title, yet reflects non of this as she blindly insisted she knows nothing about my case or issues, however she has the upmost respect and faith in their technicians and if they say there isn't any abnormalities, there just isn't. Come get your truck. i requested again a statement saying that abnormalities were heard and acknowledged and wouldn't not be repaired. She laughed and said no one would give that, no one will take liability. Your truck is ready, come get it.

Strike 3!

Then, my wife finally spoke with ""Big Boss Man P.Hunter"" who was extremely rude and condescending, he said ""the truck was never experiencing any issues or noises. there was no repairs to make. I want my loaner  back come get your truck.""  My wife asked him if Ford would honor a third part opinion and his reply was ""I don't know I don't work for Ford""  Like a broken record he kept saying to everything spoken ""your truck is ready, I want my loaner back"" Very professional attitude, right? I was beginning to think the title of ""Big Boss Man"" was no longer a sign of respect and loyalty and more of sign of tyranny subjection.

The dealership could not provide me with documents  showing what diagnostics were done to the truck, nothing shows any work done aside from the recall for a master cylinder.  however, after all this and everyone saying they heard my concerns and then suddenly,  there was never any concerns, I have a statement from the technician saying an abnormality was indeed heard.

Bottom line, this dealership is fraudulent. They will smile and work for your money, but once its paid out they won't honor their own warranty or work if it means they will take a loss in fixing their own mistakes. This dealership is lead and managed by frauds and liars. 

DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THEM. THIS DEALERSHIP GIVES FORD A BAD NAME.

The dealership had the trim of the car incorrectly listed.  I pointed this out, and they came back with something else. Wrong again.

After agreeing to buy the car for cash after 20 mins. I spent (without exaggeration) 4 hours waiting to pay for it. 

Once I saw the manager, he immediately mistook the car for a diesel (TDI vs GTI). Then while registering with the DMV screwed up the car info again, nearly registering this silver hatchback as a red sedan (glad I caught that).

Voicing my now serious concern over the correct ID of the car, the manager then dismissively told me just to just check the VIN on my way out to make sure it was in fact the right car. When I immediately left to go check the VIN myself, he took a sling at me in my absence asking my wife “what’s wrong with him” (As if checking after so much confusion what I was buying for 20G cash was so unreasonable). 

When I got it home I noticed oil change countdown was reset while in the dealer’s possession, yet dealer has no record of an oil change (I have asked twice). So basically somebody at Ford AutoNation likely just reset it to clear the electronic warning without changing the oil. This is obviously very concerning, more so because it spent 2500+ mi of its life in dealer possession.

My temporary plates are about to expire, as it has been nearly 2 months. I also don’t have a title yet, which I need to be able to prove I that own it to buy a 2nd key for the car that was missing ($300)… 

2 days ago I left a message to talk to a manger.  No reply.

We purchased a new Lifted F-250 on August 20, 2016. During test drive my husband we noticed this truck has a steering issue and was told it just need alignment and we were reassure it would be fixed no problem. We went ahead with the purchase of this truck as I was in love with how it looked. I took the truck home that evening which was a Saturday and I brought it back in for service on the following Monday to get the alignment done on the truck. When I got the truck back I noticed it was still having an issue with how it was steering so I let my sales person Leslie know. Leslie informed me that most of the trucks that Ford has lifted have this same steering issue. That made me feel uncomfortable about my purchase. So the truck is again back in for service which I guess the truck goes over to who takes care of the lifts that are on these trucks. I still don't have my truck back to me. It has been weeks now and a lot of run around from Josh Potts and Leslie Fall. I am very disappointed and I have been told that my truck will be ready and when that day comes I get another excuse as to why I can not come and pick it up. This is getting to very frustrating. I wanted to bring this to your attention because I feel that working with Josh Potts is like dealing with someone who continues to make excuses and he is dishonest.

The GM made Josh Potts call us back he would not call ",1.4
63,"August 31, 2016","This business not only uses, but openly supports unethical business practices and needs to be dealt with by the BBB.  I entered into a verbal agreement with the salesperson to purchase a vehicle.  He quoted me a price and I accepted.  An hour later when I went to complete the online application, the same salesperson INCREASED the price.  When I questioned him, he told me the price I agreed to (with a witness present) was not really a final price.  Nonetheless, I moved ahead and completed the credit application.  I called the sales person the next day as he never got back to me.  He told me they sold the car to someone else.
Salesperson and sales manager told me there was nothing I could do, sales manager was unapologetic, angry at me for escalating to him, told me we were both at fault, etc.  What's more, he told me there was nothing ethically wrong with having a deal with someone and then intentionally breaking that deal in order to sell a vehicle for more money to another buyer.  Unbelievable!  Save your time, go somewhere else where you'll be respected, treated fairly and given the ethical treatment you deserve.

I went there today after visiting most of the different dealerships along I-10 between highways 6 and 99.  They have an Explorer I liked, so I drove home to get a vehicle I'm considering to trade-in and made my back to Autonation Ford in order to get an offer on my trade-in and see if we could negotiate a deal.  The salesman I was dealing with informed me that they wouldn't appraise my vehicle if I didn't test drive the Explorer.  I currently drive a 2008 Ford Explorer, but to further the process I needed to drive a 2010 Ford Explorer - as if it's going to be some great surprise to me that it moves forward when I put my foot on the accelerator or turns in either direction as I turn the steering wheel.

Had a major repair done on a 2014 F150.
Initial Estimate for repairs exceeded $4100.00, which I knew was really HIGH!
This was based on 12 hrs of labor and over $2000 in parts.
Upon checking on standard labor hours for the repair in question, actual was supposed to be 7.2, a difference of almost 5 hrs at $140.00 per hour.
Upon checking the itemized parts list in the estimate, I discovered all parts were quoted WELL over standard FORD pricing.  
Upon checking I discovered that I had single line items with overcharges of $170.39, $133.33, 108.46, $156.82......Plus numerous smaller line items on parts.
Luckily I know how to research labor hours and parts counter prices!!!
After lots of research and then multiple visits to the dealership I was able to get the proper billing established and save approximately $1400!!!
Buyer BEWARE - How many people challenge service hours on a repair estimate?
Buyer BEWARE - How many people double check the Ford prices that they should be charging????

WORST mistake of my life after having the car less than a month i have had so many problems! i had the car for 2 day TWO DAYS!!! and I realized the windshield washer pump was not working so i called them they said they would fix it since it was just two days i was happy untill i went to drop it off i got a rental that i had to spend a week with. This isn't the part that made me regret buying my car from here. After leaving my car there for a week i went back to pick up my car. I tried out the windshield wipers to find out they had crossed the wires so when i turned on the front windshield wipers the back ones would come on and when i turned the back ones the front ones would come on.  When i mentioned it to the sale person his exact words were "" Its suppose to be that way"". I am no mechanic but i know for a FACT windshield wipers don't work that way! so they called the mechanic and got it fixed. That was TWO WEEKS AGO going into my third week of driving the car (keep in mind the dealership had the car for a week) THE CHECK ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON!!! i was driving on the freeway when the check engine light came on! I pulled over and saw that it read ""Service Stability Track"" i turned off my truck and turned it back on the check engine light was gone but i was still concerned because a car does not RANDOMLY just decide to turn its CHECK ENGINE light on!  When i called auto nation to tell them about my problem the sale person (Amarir Imad)  stated that it was not their problem i had had the car for a month. If i liked they could have me traded out of my lease or i could trade in my car! A CAR THAT I HAVE HAD JUST FOR A TOTAL OF 3 WEEKS AND WAS PAID FOR IN FULL!!!

77,"September 09, 2015","Ok. So I was involved in an accident on July 14th, 2015 and the truck had to be towed in because my radiators were busted. So in goes the truck, I receive an estimate saying it would be approximately 20 days working on the truck. On July 27th, insurance gave them to go-ahead to begin working on the truck. However, before that, they told me they would go ahead and tear down the damaged areas so once insurance gave them approval to work on the truck, they could get started immediately. On July 18th (I believe) they told us they just started tearing down the truck, which they told us they would do in the time before insurance approval. Also, because they had to deal with losses of staff in the bodyshop, calling the employee who was in charge of dealing with my truck was almost impossible to get on the phone, so I would visit the bodyshop almost daily just so I could force them to have to give me a status update (thankfully the bodyshop is on my way home so it wasn't too big of a hassle to drop by).

It gets worse. On two or three different occasions we were told the truck would be ready. The first time, they found the track bar had to be replaced because it was bent, and I understand the importance of this suspension item so I let it slide and understood. The second time I went, everything was done except for one of my headlights (aftermarket headlights). Because the headlight had not been completed, I did not want to pick it up because I did not want to have to drop my truck off on my own time. It also took them three visits and friendly but firm reminders to fix some minor scratches on the door which had not been there before the bodyshop. They did get it fixed and it looked good, so I was pleased with that.

And I visit yesterday, SEPTEMBER 8, 2015 to get another progress update on my truck. What I found horrified me. On my BRAND NEW front bumper, there were two nickel–quarter scratch/dents (better description would be a crater) in it and it was obvious they tried to cover it up with touch-up and hope I didn't notice; however, not only did they use the wrong color touch-up paint, they used the wrong color touch up paint on a dent which they made no attempt to fix the dent itself, so even if they had used the right color paint, it would still be obvious. So Christina orders them to take the truck around back. I saw the truck come back from being in the back of the shop. He (Marco) was speeding in REVERSE IN A SMALL PARKING LOT IN AN F250!!!!!! He whips it around the turn, pulls in front of the entrance to the bodyshop, leaves it running with the door open for 5 minutes with no supervision!!! Then he hops back in, whips around the turn and chirps the tires and proceeds to push it harder as he goes back to the back of the shop WHILE I WAS THERE!!!!! I was so mad I was shaking! If that happened while I was there, I don't want to imagine what they did with it while I wasn't there! I spoke with Rich, the manager, and he was furious and he personally apologized for the incident and for the touchup paint issue. He personally scolded Marco for his actions behind the wheel of my truck.

However, I will admit they products they use and the shine they put on the truck made it look amazing.

In all:
-virtually impossible to access Christina except in person
-20 day repair turned into two months and I still don't have my truck back (July 14th–September 9th)
-Personally watched my truck be recklessly driven in a parking lot
-Attempted coverup of major mistake (dent in bumper) didn't even use right color paint!!!!!!

While the work they do has looked nice so far, customer service is horrible and have caused me many headaches.",2.0

Gave me a rental after several months, however after 41 days of rental and no solution to my car being fixed, Rich (collision mgr.) cancelled my rental even though the car was still not fixed. Nice customer service Rich!  Rich is the wolf in sheep's clothing sporting the Movado watch, so you can identify him. Finally, in May they said the car was ready. We take it home and the next day going to work it overheats. Had to have it towed back to the dealer. We also notice a vibration in the car. The overheating problem was fixed. Seems they forgot to hook up the electrical power to the radiator fan. Then they tell me the vibration (which was not felt before the wreck) is indicative of a supercharged engine tearing up the driveshaft, rear end gears, and axle all at once! I called the Ford performance shop where we had the supercharger installed and they said no way would this happen. Same rear end and drive shaft that is in the supercharged Cobra's. After ins. and myself paid them over $17,500, they wanted another 4k. And since the Ford technician said it was not accident related, my insurance declined the supplement. So I get to pay it now. So, I took the car and got another opinion, and they said they could fix for 1200, about 1/4 the costs AutoNation Ford was wanting to charge ($4000) me. The driveshaft needs replaced due to the wreck, not the rear end and axle.  I guess AutoNation Ford was trying to recoup some of that rental expense. WARNING: stay clear of this place.

95,"January 11, 2014","AutoNation Ford of Katy Texas Service Department - is HORRIBLE!  BEWARE!!!  I took my Ford Edge (bought at this location) for a Friday 01/10/2013 0700 appointment.  I left the car at 0707 (per their system), and waited for the van ride that was not scheduled to leave until 0730.   Ford's ""Promise date"" for the car in their computer system was 1500 Friday 01/10/2013, but I was told it might be later to be ""checked"" (not repaired) since they were busy.  I was told I would be kept informed by my assigned “Service Advisor” Sean Rogers, who gave me all of this information.  I was never called or updated - and I had to call 8 times on Friday late afternoon via different phone numbers, through the Ford Dealer Main Operator, in order to get anyone to pick up; at 1730 Friday I was told that my car had not been checked yet.    Options offered by Sean were to leave it until Monday; or bring it back 0700 Monday and supposedly keep the ticket open so I would not lose my slot in queue, Or (after some push back by me) I could - at special agreement with the ""Manager"" - leave it and it would be first in line for the next day/Saturday morning.  I chose to be first in line Saturday - a big loss for me with no car - but bigger mistake with this Ford Service center.

Again, Saturday mid-day rolled around with no update or call.   I made 3 calls to them - no one answered.  Their operator was ""closed"" and the place was not “normal business hours” (Sat/1300).  So I got a ride there and - guess what?   The place was open,  with 6 Service Advisors  and a Manager sitting in the booths.     The gent that offered to help me (since Sean was no working) said their data system stated my car was on an ""Authorization Hold"".  He helped find out more by going back to the shop and talk to the mechanic about it.    I told him if the car was not being completed today - I needed it back, after leaving it with them for 30 hours.

30 minutes later - my car comes.  They had not even looked at it.  They took a quick look at that time only to tell me it was something “complicated – and not a quick fix”.

In speaking with the ""Service Manager"" (Trent?) I helped him by filling in the little missing details around his vague explanation on the process, as he stated ""well,  Sean should have told you on Friday/0700 that the car would not be seen until MONDAY""  (!)   I reminded them what I was told, that no calls were made to me yesterday, promises were made to be seen first thing Saturday morning, and their own system listed me as ""Authorization Hold"".   They seemed to be grasping at straws to explain all of this as if I knew too much.   All of this is bad enough.  But this runaround is the second time to occur to me in the past 1.5 years with this same car at Katy Ford!  I thought the change from Champion Ford to AutoNation Ford might have improved their program.  Not the case from my experiences – it was the same Manager I dealt with last time.    
  
They did the very same thing to me before – so – if you have a choice, consider all of your options.  
My thoughts are that they might be playing games since they are very busy, short on service techs (told to me when I made my appointment), and their system – well – if I understand their quality control processes – I think they are playing games to ensure that long service appointments or missed obligations are negated by offhanded key-strokes marking a job like mine as a “Authorization Hold” when it is really not.    This would not show as a negative in Ford’s Quality Assurance program.  Just a guess (yes, that is something I do for work).   This is the smarmy impression I have from my experience.

Now – I just need to fix the car.
Then I need to decide whether I’ll ever buy a Ford again.  You know I’ll never step foot in AutoNation Ford of Katy Texas – again.

96,"December 31, 2013","On Dec 31, 2013, I went to AutoNation Katy to buy a Mustang V6 Coupe with Bluetooth which they had quoted me on the internet. This car was for my daughter who was there with me.  When we got there, I showed Chuck the salesman my letter from my credit union saying I had an financing.  We negotiated awhile but remained $500 apart.  Finally,  we agreed on the price without the $500 with both me and Chuck's manager signing a form that agreed on the price.

Chuck went back to his sales manager again with the signed form and the came back and said that part of the rebate, $500, was contingent on financing through Ford credit.  I said no, that I had showed them the credit union letter and I intended to finance through the CU.  Chuck went back to the sales manager who then came out to talk.  He said he couldn't do the deal without financing through Ford.  I said my interest rate was 1.9% what was Ford's.  He told me straight out that it would not be beneficial to me, that if I got the $500 rebate, the interest rate would be higher costing me more than $500 in interest.  I asked the sales manager why did they quote with Ford financing to begin with when I showed them the letter when I came in.  He said this was the first he heard that I already had financing. That is their game to not negotiate with the deal maker, reach a deal, then have the deal maker step in with a reason they can’t hold to that price and then want to negotiate higher.

This shows the shadiness of this dealership, quoting an alternate you don't want hoping you don't catch the cost in order to get a sale without being straight forward.

Don't go to AutoNation Ford.

Most recent experience : I tried to drop off vehicle for blend dorr actuator repair.  It is a 2010 Expedition so I was already mad that I needed this repair (on top of throttle body and 02 sensor within the first 40,000 miles).  I made an appointment on line but when I showed up I found out that they would not get to the car for 3 days.  Since I needed to get a rent car this was unaccaptable.  I asked if they could just call me on day 2 or 3 of the ""wait"" and let me drop it off.  I was told no.  They are not friendly and act as if I am doing them a favor by using them.  I have been disappointed so many times by them.

106,"May 12, 2013",I recently purchased a brand new Ford Focus Titanium from Auto Nation.  We had recently had trouble with another dealership in Houston and so we called Auto Nation before we left to ensure we would not have a wasted trip again.  Our salesman was Edward Juarez. He was really helpful on the phone and so it prompted us to go and visit the dealership.  It was an easy place to find and we were greeted by friendly staff.  Edward was a really friendly and helpful guy.  Nothing was too much for him and he happily sat in the car explaining all the gadgets to me with a screaming 6 week old baby.  We did not feel pushed into anything and he stuck to his word and agreement we had discussed on the phone.  The car itself was exactly how it was online and was washed and ready for us.

110,"March 26, 2013","We were USAA Auto Circle buyers and had brought in our certificates with us for a couple of different F250 diesel trucks and were looking elsewhere. I defintely recommend using the internet to get most information on what you are desiring to buy before heading out to any lot. John Knight, our salesman, did an excellent job of answering the questions we had without being the typical used car salesman, and allowing us to take the lead in our purchase and the decisions we needed to make. We felt that we were treated like grown ups and intellgient customers rather than being ""sold"". One thing that was very helpful in our decision making process for buying was explaining the benefit of buying a Certified Preowned from them (Ford from Ford) rather than going down the road and buying a similar vehicle from a Chevy dealer's lot,  and that ultimately brought us back for one of their vehicles. The value of the CPO program is excellent and you still have the option of buying an extended wrap warranty on top of that if you want to. The price on the truck we bought was good for both the truck and being a CPO plus the value for our trade was better than the other places we had been, and we don't have the time to sell a vehicle ourselves, so we appreciated that. We met the location manager, who was very nice. Their finance guy has the absolute best disposition for his job, and we came in with extremely competitive financing with USAA that we elected to use rather than let them attempt to compete for it, but he didn't hassle us about it. We have had the opposite happen. He told us that we were doing well with what we had and we moved on with our paperwork. What is usually one of the worst experiences during the purchase was excellent.

The last thing that happened before we left to go home in our new to us truck has never, ever happened at a dealer before. We have owned 19 vehicles in 21 years of marriage, and this is the worst economy we have ever seen. They filled the tank full with diesel. Who does that? We will definitely be back the next time and will be recommending this dealer and our salesman to folks we know, and we look forward to going back for service. We bought a 3 year oil change and tire rotation for the truck for $250, which saves a bundle when you drive a diesel! The whole experience was very positive. Thanks, AutoNation Ford!",5.0
111,"March 22, 2013","First off, use the internet to find your vehicle there first.  This will save you time due to the sheer number of cars they have at this dealership!  Plus they do post an internet price that is cheaper than the price they advertise at the dealership.  I thought overall it was a straightforward process.  The biggest piece of negotiation wasn't on the price of my new truck, but on the trade in of my old car.  They give you a fair price on your new car, but everything else at this dealership is a negotiation.  They definitely try to make up their money on extended warranties, and maintenance packages.  Again, remember everything (besides the internet price) is a negotiation.  I would go back to buy another car there.  Dolores (Sales), Mark (Sales Manager), and Marcus (Finance) were great.",4.5
112,"March 13, 2013","We were looking for a pre-owned Lexus GS and had done quite a bit of research in the greater Houston area.

She was very friendly and helpful, and not at all pushy. 

We had financing from our bank pre-approved and the dealership was able to accept it. The car was such a good deal that we kept wondering: ""What's wrong with it?"" We took it to our mechanic and he said everything checked out fine. We had a very good experience and got a great deal! Highly recommend the dealership and Belinda.",5.0

Told him then my price I wanted, he counter offered then we met in the middle. Simplest negotiations I have ever been apart of. The entire process too about 3 hours.

117,"March 03, 2013","went to Katy Ford at 7:03AM Saturday 3/2/13.  I was 13th in line to be seen and in the first batch of visitors from when the doors opened. 

I requested my first ever oil change, carwash, and detail. Also that my Fiesta recall be updated because my passenger side airbag light continues to come on.

the worker advised this will take up to 3 hours. Although extreme for a simple oil change, detailing, and button reset for a recall adjustment, I agree to wait. My family had a vacation scheduled to San Antonio from Houston, and I did not want to go on the road without the oil change first. 

Within the first 2 hours, My rep returns to say a test was ran and the passenger airbag light does not seem to be the result of anything wrong. 

After 3.5 hours of patiently waiting for a basic oil change, car wash, and detail (of a recently purchased and very well taken care of car- in other words, not filthy or overly time consumingly-troublesome) I finally go check on the maintenance status. After shuffling through a stack of papers and looking on the computer, My rep confirms the airbag light has been checked and the oil change complete, but the detailing is underway. I ask, ""has it begun or is it waiting to be started? I need a status update, I was told 3 hours- though extreme I was willing but now its more than that and I need a detailed update."" My rep could not provide one and said he would go check. In a half hour, 4 hours later, I go back to check and My rep is not in his office. I check outside and he's looking around for my car, it's no where to be found. He doesn't even know where it is. As I'm asking him what is going on, a gentleman comes up and says ""we don't have the paperwork on that car for a car wash so its been sitting there. They won't touch it without the papers."" My rep said he provided documentation for it but the guy said he still needed certain forms. I'm completely appalled at this time because no maintenance rep thought to take the initiative to mention that a car was being ignored for hours or request needed a paper??? And likewise, My rep didn't take the initiative to check on the status of the vehicle (in detail) (Note: I am not sure if he correctly completed the necessary paperwork  but the upset of that part is worth acknowledging too...) My rep escorts me back in to complete the paperwork and say he'll pay for a car wash which is a $30 value but my detailing will take an extra hour and I still have to pay for that. (Please note, I did not come to Ford to get free service. I came with the intent to pay for everything I requested. A $30 car wash does not compensate one hour of my time, so although this was borderline offensive, I recognize that it was still however, a nice gesture. I am very perturbed at this point because after all this time I will not even receive the service I visited for. I wanted the detailing to assure the most pleasant family vacation transportation experience and by then it was completely ruined... I didn't have more hours upon hours to give to servicing, I needed to go. I agreed to the wash. 5 hours later at 12:00PM I ask for my keys back- finished or not. My 6 & 7 year old children who have been suffering the entire wait are now hungry and restless. I have to feed them and the diabetic friend accompanying me since breakfast had looong wore off by this time. Seeing how hungry everyone was and knowing how horrible Ford had been, My rep gave us sandwich lunches from Ford. He said the carwash service had already begun and he'd like me to let them finish. Since he solved my family's problem of hunger, I let them finish. At about 12:30PM I finally leave.

In terms of Ford being able to do the job and my rep being kind, their grade fair. But as for organization, efficiency, prioritizing customer needs, getting what one asks for, receiving a value for money spent and feeling valued- I would never recommend Champion Ford based on my experience(s). It was the first and likely last maintenance visit I've made on my couple month old car. I'm disappointed in Ford and that I purchased my vehicle from them.

Oh and did I mention that I was still charged for the 5 hr long oil change?!!!",1.8

Before driving it off the lot, we noticed a ding in each of the front doors. The passenger side door ding is down to the primer.  Our sales guy said this happens all the time because of how close they park together. He assured us that we would make arrangements to fix it, no problem. 3 weeks later after my husband returns to Afghanistan, I call and set up a time for it to get fix. Our sales guy gives me another truck to drive while they fix the dents. Few days later,I get a call and I go to pick up the truck. Driver side door looks good but the passenger side door was touch up with silver paint. They kept the truck again to fix what they tried to cover up. Next day, they call and the truck is done. I go to pick up the truck and it looks good. I get home a few hours later and a friend noticed the edges of the paint chip. They painted the door but never sanded the paint chip. And with further inspection, there was dirt in the paint. When looking at the inside he also noticed gaps with the inside panel. They had taken the outside hardware and the inside panel off. Who ever did this gouged holes in the handle of the door. They did not line up the panel correctly and tightened the screw at the bottom so tight that the plastic turned white and was smashed.
I immediately went back to the dealership and again left it there. The manager Joe never came to to talk to me but instead sent Jenna to take my complaint. Days later went to pick up the truck again. This time the paint chip is completely gone after the 3rd attempt, Finally. When I inspect the damage they fixed, they again had someone covered it up with plastic, it was horrible. What ever they did it was rubbing off when u touched it. When I checked the screws, the plastic still pierced and flat. But as I was looking I noticed some scraps under the door frame. They have scraped paint off. I could see metal. Again I had to leave it. As of right now my anxiety level is threw the roof. What else will they destroy on a brand new truck? 
I have tried to talk to the manger in sales. Mr.Colvin has not deemed it necessary to return my call. But has assured me thru others that it will be fixed. 
I was told if I want it fixed they have to do it. 
The body shop has zero standards and communication skills. Terrible work. And the sales manager is the same. They do not care once you make the purchase. No integrity at all. There is more I could have added to make them look bad. But you get the idea.

The service is so bad at Champion Ford that I am willing to drive an additional 20 miles to get my car serviced at another dealership. Please do not go to this dealership for service.,1.5
142,"June 02, 2012","Champion in Katy was the fourth dealership we had been to in the  span of a four day period. Unlike any of the other dealerships, we told Christopher what we wanted in a new car and he delivered. He was  professsional and friendly.There were no hasssles nor manipulations. Christopher was very straight-forward with what he needed from us and simplified the entire process. In fianance, we met Craig. Craig, as well, was very professional, friendly, and very straight-forward in explaining our financial paperwork. The paperwork contained no hidden fees. Our options were offered in Craig's office, as far as warranty and other offers through Ford. Craig listened to our concerns and explained everything to us. No pressure, just clear explanations of their offers. So easy to talk with both of these guys which took all the stress out of the buying process. After the paperwork was done, Christopher explained how Sync works and took the time to associate our phones and contacts to the system. In addition, he explained the functions of the Information Displays. We were about ready to quit after negotiating with dealerships that were trying to push us into what they wanted to sale.As we've already stated, we worked with Christopher and Craig; however, we want you to know that every person at Champion was friendly and accommodating to our needs. We've referred a couple of family members already and will be referring more as the days go by. Thank you Champion in Katy for taking the stress off and selling us this beautiful vehicle! We appreciate the honesty, good salesmanship, and above all the excellent customer service.

Thanks again,
Mike and Brenda Fielden",5.0
143,"June 01, 2012",Dropped my car off at 7:15 AM and they could not repair that day.  No one mentioned that the car may not be repaired that day.  Faulty actuator in air conditioning system means that I will be driving a hot car for another week.  Poor quality and poor service.  ,1.4
144,"August 12, 2011","I have had my Ford Expedition for 3 year and have had the worst service ever on a new vehicle from Champion Ford.  The poor service, poor attitudes of the service reps is an ongoing problem.  Yesterday, 8-11-2011, I had an appointment for an oil change.  I was told it would take 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  I waited over 3 hours.  When my car was ready I was told my car was in the parking lot ready.  I was also told I had a nail im my tire's sidewall that could not be fixed and I needed a new tire.  The service rep NEVER EVEN GAVE ME A PRICE or consulted me to see if I wanted to do anything but instead sent me away on a tire with a nail.  What if I was in an accident on my way home.  LAW SUIT!  This is not the first time I have had problems.  Champion's Service Department is the worst.  THREE HOURS FOR AN OIL CHANGE?  Why not have, what most dealerships have, a ""Quick Serivce Oil Change"".  Get the customer in and out quickly for simple maintenance.  Long waits, poor attitudes, and poor service.  Do you think I would buy from Champion again?  NOT!!!",1.6

146,"May 30, 2011","This was a great buying experience for my family.  A wonderful sales person, took his time to help us find the vehicle we wanted.  They also had Avery large selection of vehicles to choose from.  The F & I did a great job ex aiming everything to us.  There was no pressure to buy.",4.8
147,"May 23, 2011","Champion Katy Ford is my local Ford dealership.  Over the years I have been pleased with the staff and service of the Parts Department, Body Shop and the service department.  I typically have received helpful and professional assistance.  I am a car enthusiast and have restored several Mustangs and do most of my own mechanical repairs on the family's cars.  The staff in the above departments have always been very accommodating with my detail questions about the work I am having done by them.  The parts department has always gone out of there way to help me find and order the parts I need.

Recently I was in the market to purchase a 2012 Mustang Boss 302 Laguna Seca.  A very limited edition model with a $48,000 price tag.  I was inquired about the availability and whether the dealership could order one - Ford has an allocation process that limits which dealers get the car and how many.  The floor sales representative (Pete MacArthur) was not very helpful - he did not know much about the BOSS 302 program or the available models.  He was unaware of the allocation process and deferred to the inventory manager.  I later provided him a copy of a Ford Memo to the dealers about the allocation process.  I called him several times, stopped at the dealership at least 4 times and sent him emails.  He call me only one time and does not do email.  I am surprised he can keep his job as a new car sales associate based on the lack of his interest in selling me a $48,000 Mustang.  The Internet Sales representative (Michelle Imler) did respond promptly to my emails and did call me a couple of times.  She was not familiar with the Boss 302 program and did not seem to be particularly interested in learning more even after I sent her program information in emails.  The typical response I got from Pete and Michelle was ""we can order your car for you and wait and see if Ford will accept the order"".  After wasting my time over a span of two weeks dealing with the sales staff at Champion Katy Ford I started looking elsewhere.  Several of the other Houston area dealers were helpful and knew what the Boss 302 allocations were and whether they could order a Boss 302 Laguna Seca.  I ended up ordering the car from a large sales volume Ford dealer in Carrollton, Texas.  That experience was wonderful, I was treated like a rock star and took delivery on my LS Boss 302 yesterday. :)

148,"December 15, 2010","I purchased a used car in August, and realized shortly thereafter that the vehicle had been in an accident.  Although the carfax vehicle history report mentioned nothing of the sort, upon closer inspection it was easy to see that it had in fact been in an accident (headlights. hood are not symmetrical).  The dealer had to know this was the case, but conveniently failed to mention anything about it.  And, now looking back, the dealership went out of their way to hide the cover-up (pictures of the car were taken at certain angles, etc.).

It's unfortunate - I've had nothing but great experiences dealing with Champion (purchasing and/ or servicing my cars) - and had figured I'd purchase all my vehicles from this dealership; however, I will never step one foot at this dealership again, and will happily drive further to take my car to be serviced at another Ford dealership.

I was a life-long customer, but will be taking all my car buying/ servicing business elsewhere.",1.0
149,"August 30, 2010","I took my Ford Fusion in for a new battery.  I arrived at the dealership at 8:30 am and was greeted by Mike.  I explained I was having battery problems and was told that it would take an hour to have my car ready. 
After an hour, Mike came in and stated that they did not have the battery my car needed (no battery for the popular Ford Fusion?) and they would have to go out to get one.  Mike informed me it would only take a little longer.  An hour passed, and I still was waiting.  I went up to the front desk and asked if my car was ready.  I was informed by the receptionist that the car was still in ""parts needed"" status.  The receptionist then suggested looking for Mike to find out what was going on.  Well, the only problem was there was no Mike to be found.  I waited for another hour, silently fuming because my son had a doctor's appointment and I was going to have to cancel, and then went back up to the desk.  I informed the receptionist that I couldn't wait any longer because my son was sick and needed to go to the clinic.  She paged for the technician working on my car and was informed that it was almost ready.  Half an hour later, Mike informed me that my car was ready to go and thanked me for my patience. 
This was rediculous!  I waited almost 4 hours for a simple batter change!  If you are coming to this dealership, bring your suitcase and be prepared to stay for a long, long time. They definately need to improve customer service!",2.2
150,"August 11, 2010","I was greeted cordially by Mike and the car was ready when he promised. I was bringing the car in due to a recall on the computer for the transmission. I had to wait 30 minutes for the shuttle to pick me up. When I returned to the dealership the receptionist had me sign for the typical paperwork and handed me a survey to fill out on Mike before she asked me if I would like for him to go over the paperwork. Otherwise, I would've given him a much worse review on the survey.  He comes out of his office with a toothpick in his mouth stating they was nothing to go over, it was a recall. He talked to me in the 3rd person the whole time. He kept saying this is a recall, she doesn't need an explanation. ( I was standing right there by him.) He restated, "" she needs to make sure she gets the 30,000 mile service done. She doesn't need to do it all in one chunk but it needs to be done.""  I said, ""I have to have it done to honor the warranty, right?"" He said, ""Yes."" I said, ""Does Ford have to do it?"" He said, "" Now, that's not what I said is it? You can get anyone to do it just keep the receipts.""

His tone was very condescending and he was very rude. I will never take the car back there unless there is another recall. I will never buy a car from them, either.

During a previous service visit the technician left the oil cap off and I left the next day on a 6 hour road trip. I made it to my destination fine but I lost a lot of oil and it sprayed everywhere under the hood. ",1.4
