13,"August 29, 2019","Everyone at Vara was very polite. No wasted time, straight to the point with the deal, small haggle over trade in value but worked through that. I personally want to know what the deal is with minimal or no haggling. Waste of time if that happens. Jessie was very helpful. He helped with the transfer of my property from old truck to new.

21,"April 19, 2019","Vara is a great delaership that tries their best to get you in a vehicle. I started years ago with no vehicle, they helped get into a certified pre owned. I then traded it in years later at vara for a new malibu. They helped me again to get a much needed second vehicle for my girlfriend and 3 year old son. It was hard with one vehicle but now it has changed for the better for my family. Ronnie helped with a spectacular deal on a 2019 sonic dart. I cant thank everyone enough that was involved in this process to help my family. Vara will be by go to dealer forever and will always reccomend this dealership to anyone seeking a vehicle.

25,"March 29, 2019","I had a accident and they towed my car here. Once I tried to get them to release it the manager Steve Cortinas would not want to he gave me so much push back I said fine I will leave it there to be fixed. That should have been my first sign! He claimed that they were the best collision center and that the repairs would be perfect and it would be quick! That should have been my first sign! They called me 3 different times claiming that my car was ready, it was not. After a month they were done with it. They got my back seats dirty with what looks to be oil and my battery was drained. I had purchased the battery less than a year before taking my car to get fixed. I didn't say anything about the battery nor the dirty seats. The other day I washed my car and realized the hood was misaligned. I went to talk Steve Cortinas and he told me ""well your going to need to make an appointment if you want it perfect ..."" Now I have to wait another week to take the car in and have them work on it for a hour! DO NOT TRUST THIS DEALERSHIP! THEY ARE ONLY SCAMMING THE INSURANCE COMPANY! SAVE YOUR SELF THE HEADACHE AND TROUBLE GO TO A SERVICE KING! I never had issues with service king! I regret not using them this time!

32,"February 02, 2019",My 2nd oil and tire rotation was not so great. They did not rotate my tires because I installed new rims even though the invoice stated they did(strike one). As I drove away my oil percentage was not reset it still indicated 15% which I had doubts if they even changed the oil. I had the service manager check the oil dipstick in front of me to see the clean oil (strike two). I purchased this truck in September of 18 on Labor Day and I closed late that day and my salesman said he would have them detail it as a new purchase vehicle and I still have yet to receive that (strike three). I did receive a free ball cap....,3.4

47,"July 03, 2018","Took my Impala to be serviced by Domingo Vara in February. Was told it would be about three weeks before they could even look at it. I agreed. I told Chris in Service that my extended warranty contract was in the glove compartment and what the problem was. I told him my car still moved, however it was making a horrible noise. Very nice guy and polite. Told me he would call me back when they started the car. Three weeks later and no call. I contacted him and he said he was waiting for me to contact him with the issues on the car. I said ""no, you were supposed to call me"" He said they hadn't even looked at it yet. asked me again about the warranty and I reminded him again to look in the glove. He said they would start tearing it up soon. I called a week later and he said that because the extended warranty company would need a ""Point of Failure"" He needed an authorization from me to go ahead because the price was 1,100.00 even if they didn't fix the car. I said ""ok"" to ahead and start working on it. He said ""ok"". Two weeks later, I had to call him back and he said ""Oh I was waiting for you to authorize the break down of the car. I said, I told you ok to start working on the car and you said you would contact the extended warranty company. He said he would call me with the diagnosis. Three days later, I Call HIM back and he said that the Point of Failure indicated that a Piston had shot through the motor and I would need a new motor. He said it would be 4,600.00 and I reminded him again about the extended warranty and he said he was going to call them and would let me know what they said. Two and a half weeks later I call to see when my car would be done and he said. ""Oh yeah, it was not the motor, whoever did your transmission did not torque the bolts to Impala specifications"" and it damaged all the parts in between, there were metal shavings all over the fly wheel, it's going to cost 2649.00 plus there are other problems with your wheels but they should be covered by your extended warranty but not the other work. I told him I needed to see where I could get the money to get it fixed and would call him back. I went to three Transmission guys and they ALL said the same thing. ""no way, if they hadn't torqued the bolts right, upon turning the car on, it would have blown the cam sensor immediately, not two years later. I called Chris and then he stopped taking my calls. I called and they transferred me to a lady named Kai and I left her messages but never got a call back. I called back June 4th and told the receptionist I wanted to speak to someone that could help me and David Vara, Owner came to the phone and Immediately stated ""Ma'am, you're not going to change my mind, I agree with the decision that Kai made. I said ""ok, can you please tell me what that decision is because I have no idea what you are talking about. No one has called me back to inform me of anything. He said ""well again, I am standing behind her and nothing you say will change that"". I said ""Mr. Vara, again will you please tell me what her decision was?"" and he stated, well I have to get with her on that and I will call you back. He didn't even know himself. He was rude and ugly to me and I soooooooo regret ever taking my car there. here we are in July and I am still waiting for Mr. David Vara to call me back. I just want my car back. But I am not paying them anything. They lied. ",1.0

When we arrived friendly staff came up to our vehicle and said sorry about the wait we will be with you shortly.  Second person came by and asked are you here for your oil change, we said yes and we told her we made an appointment online.  She then tells us that to do not make appointment online for Saturdays? (Well I did and have made 2 other appointments online since then).  Young lady then say oil change should take about 1 1/2 hour.  We decided to wait, we moved up in line when finally the service manager asked what we were there for, we told him an oil change and that we scheduled an 8 am appointment.  He said that Saturdays are first come first serve and that I should not have been able to do so. (well once again I did and have schedule 2 fake appointment for this Saturday 9-6 online).  After two hours of waiting for my FREE oil change, I asked to speak with the service manager Jose Rodriguez, he was very apologetic and said that Saturdays are on a 1st come 1st served.  But I MADE AN APPOINTMENT.  He then says he would pull a service guy and start working on my car.  Waited another hour before it was complete.  Jose was very apologetic and kept making excuses and recommendations for next time, Never did I feel that my being and wasting 3 hours of our day was important to them.  Still upset with service received and that morning I kept seeing David Vara there, I should have complained to him.  PLEASE FORWARD HIM THIS MESSAGE.   This was my second visit.

103,"September 01, 2011","I was involved in an auto accident in May 2011.  I then went to Domingo Vara Chevrolet for my estimate where I received excellent service from Steve Cortinas, Body Shop Estimator.  He was sincerely concerned with my damages and my well-being.  As he wrote my estimate....he also called Enterprise Rent A Car and got me back on the road!  During the entire repair process Mr. Cortinas kept me updated with the progress of my vehicle repairs.  In four days my car was repaired beautifully and I received a Lifetime Warranty on the repairs to my vehicle for as long as I own the vehicle!  Since then I have recommended Vara Chevrolet Collision Center to my friends and amily and I will continue to do so!",5.0
104,"August 31, 2011","First I would like to note that I have been a customer of Vara Chevrolet for over 10 years.  They continue to provide my family and I excellent customer service and great quality of work.



I brought in my 2002 TrailBlazer for some body shop work on 8/22. They promised it would be ready by 8/26/2011.  Not only did they complete it by the deadline originally stated, but the quality was almost as if I had just purchased a new TrailBlazer.  Initially, I told Walter that I wanted the truck to look as if no damage had ever been done. He knew I was serious about the statement I had made.  He also knows I'm a very particular type of individual when it comes to our trucks.  All I can say about Walter and his Team is that he delivers on his quality of work and does his very best on keeping his customers very happy.

Thank you Walter and Vara Body Shop Team!
