69,"June 20, 2018","First of all I was real close to rating this dealership as Average & not recommending stating I would  anyone to this particular dealership. I'm still not very happy w/ this past visit. If it were not for the Outstanding service tech, Harley I would have rated lower.  She was professional, confident, seems to understand her job very well. I did 30 years in the USAF. I've seen & dealt with all types of individuals; this young lady is very Sharp! I like this & demand that she is the only tech to provide service to my vehicle in the future!

My issue/s: It seems as if I have a Lemon of a vehicle. Hence my initial lead in on the average overall dealership rating!! It seems I had a few issues w/my vehicle other than what I brought it in for Brake pads/Oil Change). My transmission mount, belt tensioner & both ball joints were in need of repair as well. My issue/s: I'm wondering if any of this could have been discovered in my past service some 6K miles ago during my 8yr/80K mile service & where my entire steering column was replaced due to inoperable tilt motor? I having a very hard time understanding all these issues happening that pace in that span of time. I purchased the vehicle with 63,223 miles, actually thought it was  a sound investment considering the prestige of Alderson. Needless to say I'm starting to get a little worried now.

I'm trying to understand these type 7, 8 and 9 year services. Is it not a prerequisite to check the vehicle out during these services; some type of inspection checklist? At any rate I'm anal about all of my vehicles, I feel like a Top Notch dealership like Alderson should feel the same as I do. So in the future, PLEASE PLEASE ensure my vehicle is given the same exact attention to detail Ms. Harley provided. 

Mr. Ebeling is always courtesy & professional. My frustration isn't w/him. I'm trying to grasp these issues w/my particular vehicle.  

I hope this short feedback provides ALL a feeling of standing in my shoes as a customer of Alderson!
This feedback isn't targeted at anyone but I'm trying to keep a open mind on the constant issues w/my vehicle.

Respectfully,

Mr. Smith

I contacted Alderson and let them know that I live and work for a public school district approximately 140 miles from Lubbock. I explained that I would find it difficult to make it to Lubbock to get the necessary maintenance completed without needing to take a day off. Rather than cause any inconvenience for me, Alderson sent a driver with a loaner vehicle (also a 2018 GLA 250) for me to use while they completed the scheduled maintenance on my vehicle. There were no questions asked and I truly felt they were happy to do it!

The charges were exactly what he said they would be.  Aside from the repairs taking longer than I (or he) expected, my overall experience there (my first) was very good.

96,"January 12, 2018","We have about a 12 year history with Alderson's in Lubbock, Texas.... 2 consecutive leases of BMW vehicles and Alderson's has been servicing our 2011 BluTec Mercedes for 7 years. The service department headed up by Monte Ebeling is superb! We do not live in Lubbock and there is no Mercedes or BMW dealership in San Angelo so Monte arranges for our vehicles to be brought to Lubbock for service. We are provided with a comparable loaner vehicle and when service is complete our vehicle is brought back to us. The charge for this is MORE than reasonable and enables us to drive a vehicle that would otherwise be impossible due to our busy schedules and the inability to travel for service appointments. We plan on driving up in the near future to look at new Mercedes vehicles. We love Alderson's!",5.0

103,"September 16, 2017","At my 45,000 mile service Monte Ebeling advised me of the condition of the rear tires on my E350. We went over the options for replacement, there was no sales pressure just advice. I purchased four new tires online and had them delivered to the dealership. I scheduled an appointment when the tires came in, met with Monte was given an estimated time for the completion of the work and received my car washed an ready to go within that time. Monte came up thanked me for coming in and shook my hand. My thanks to Alderson for such a wonderful and friendly atmosphere and a great employees.",5.0

All of the concerns with my vehicle were addressed and expectations were met! Since we come in from out of state for service to our vehicle, a loaner is ready to go. He calls in a timely fashion to let us know about what time our car will be ready so we don't feel rushed to get back to the dealership! Thank you until next time!",5.0

106,"August 28, 2017",We recently purchased a Mercedes Gls450w4 from Alderson European Motors of Lubbock.  Benny Bennett provided great service and set up several vehicles for us to compare as we went through the buying process.  Setting up the lease and getting all of the paperwork completed was a breeze with Michael Sanford.  We are thrilled with the vehicle and look forward to the continued exceptional customer service for all of our future service needs.  This is our 4th or 5th vehicle from Alderson.  We are spoiled by the great attention we receive and recommend that anyone looking for a luxury brand vehicle make Alderson your first stop.,5.0
107,"July 23, 2017","Monte Ebeling always provides us with excellent service at a reasonable price.  I would recommend Alderson's to anyone. Considering all that was done, it did not take too long, and the Mercedes loaner was a pleasure to drive.  We had time for a leisurely lunch and a small amount of shopping at Dillards, and were then informed our car was ready.  We made it home to Tuscola before dark!!

113,"May 18, 2017","I didn't feel pressured; just concerned helpful people. Omar Hernandez was knowledgeable about the vehicle and made me feel very comfortable. He took a good deal of time to ensure that I knew at least the basics about operating the vehicle before I left, because he knew I was traveling from out of town. He ensured that I had his cell phone number just in case I needed to contact him with any concerns or questions.  GREAT person to work with.",4.5

116,"November 10, 2016","This is the my second lease with Alderson Mercedes. I have bought/leased several cars from Alderson over the years. The service from the beginning to the end is the top level. They quickly understand what are your needs and found the car we liked very quickly. As usual, the whole negotiation process, the old car turn in process, and paper work process were done in a quick, professional and pleasant way. Very satisfied experience. Caleb Hernandez, the salesman, was great, highly recommended!",5.0
117,"September 01, 2016",I loved everything about the process of buying my first Mercedes from Alderson. My mom has been a long time customer and they have always treated her well. Crystal Marquez did an incredible job in assisting me and making the process simple and easy. I'm so happy I chose Alderson!,5.0
118,"October 05, 2014","We went to Alderson twice to look for a used BMW or Mercedes to purchase. The first time we went, the salesman hardly paid any attention to us. When we finally tracked someone down, they told us they would call when some vehicles would be ready (apparently they were being detailed). We waited 5 days for a call and received nothing. So, we called them back and the BMW we were interested in (that they had told us wasn't available yet) had sold, but they were still waiting on these other vehicles to be ready. We went to Alderson's the next day and the cars were still not ready and the bored salesman said ""he would call us."" After receiving such horrible service, we found several dealers in the Dallas area that were much nicer and Auto America in Grand Prairie found us a car overnight. We flew to Dallas, bought the car, and drove back to Lubbock. I don't know what is wrong with the people at Alderson's, but I will never consider going to them again. There are too many car dealers in Texas to waste your time on a small town dealer that apparently only caters to a certain ""type"" of client. ",1.0
