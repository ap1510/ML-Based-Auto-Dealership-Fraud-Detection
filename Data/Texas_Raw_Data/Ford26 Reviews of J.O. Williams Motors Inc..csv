1,"February 03, 2020",Glen Hodges came to Longview to help with my fuel pump problem. It was very appreciated that he would do that on a Sunday afternoon. Dealership fixed my problem in one day and the job was done quickly and efficiently. Would not take my vehicle anywhere else!!!,5.0
2,"January 24, 2020","My 2004 Thunderbird needed a part replaced.  The service people were efficient and pleasant. The repairs were done within the time estimate, and the total amount was as stated before leaving the vehicle.  They make you feel like a valued friend, and take good care of the cars in their shop.",5.0
3,"December 10, 2019","I had a great experience, everyone at the dealership was very helpful. Dash Williams is a great person and I really enjoyed working with him.",4.8
4,"February 26, 2019","I have used J. O. Williams Ford for years.  Easy to purchase and great service after the sell.  I won't buy anywhere else.  Easy purchase, easy to work with.  Awesome people.  ",5.0
5,"June 17, 2018","We have bought a used 2007 Ford F-250 and have had some injector issues and J O Williams Ford is making things right. They are replacing the bad injectors and loaning us a car while doing all this out of their own pockets. I have bought many cars in my life time and have never been treated this well, not even when buying a new car. We highly recommend this dealership. You are just not going to find another dealership that will treat you any better. We also were treated good on the deal itself, gave me what I wanted and with no haggle at all. I did research and knew the actual value of my trade and knew the value of the truck we were buying, so I knew the deal was good. They put new running boards on and replaced a broken drink holder at no additional cost. Can't say too much good about Dash Williams and J.O.Williams Ford. ",5.0
6,"May 24, 2018","Michael, Danny, and Jim were very helping with the purchase of my 2nd Explorer. I have been buying cars from them since 1978 and have always had the best experience with sales and especially with service (thank you, Glenn!). I highly recommend JO Williams Ford. I wouldn't have any other dealer decal on the back of my vehicle!",5.0
7,"April 09, 2017",We bought the cheapest car on the lot and Danny treated us like we had bought a new Lincoln for list.  He knew he was well below book on the car but made us an even better offer.  Danny stayed late after closing and showed the car separately to our college age son.  Best buying experience we've had in 35 year of buying cars.,5.0
8,"December 18, 2015","My rating was based on the fact that this is our third vehicle we have purchased from J O Williams and from  vehicle one to vehicle three we have been treated just like family and the hometown boys will continue to get our business for a long time.. You tell what you want and they will find it!
Dash is just awesome!

11,"October 27, 2015","I gave this rating because I am always treated with courtesy and respect when I am ready to buy a car. I bought my first car at another Ford dealership here in East Texas and shopping around, I was treated like a bother. I had to practically beg salesmen to wait on me, one actually told me that 'we don't make any money off these cars'...as if I looked so stupid that I would believe they were just providing cars as a charity. Dash Williams always seems happy to hear from me, is very accommodating to my needs and schedule. I have never had a problem one with this dealership. I STRONGLY encourage single women especially to come here.....you will not be treated like idiots (as so many other dealerships do!)

I have bought three cars here. The first two were Focuses, this time I wanted a Fusion, Dash worked with me last year and I decided I wasn't ready. I called him this year and I am in my new Fusion in no time! I LOVE this car. It is only a base model but it feels like a luxury vehicle! Silky smooth ride and great gas mileage.",5.0
12,"October 12, 2015",Michael Williams and the whole group provide the best customer service bar none.  I live in the Metroplex and yet still purchase my Fords from J.O. Williams.  They are always very fair in their pricing and their service department is top notch.  I have been a 13+ year customer and recommend anyone looking for a new or used Ford to contact them.,5.0
13,"July 24, 2015",Thank you so much Phillip Anderson for making my purchase so easy !! I never dreamed things could go as quickly and smoothly as they did !!  Y'all are awesome !!! ,5.0
14,"July 05, 2015","As  15 + years  customer of J.O. Williams Ford,  we are truly impressed with the professional representation of the company name in the way that  Dash Williams, Jim Roberts and Josh Johnson made us feel welcome. We  truly appreciate the honest representation of the Ford product and the personal service from the time we arrived on the lot until we closed the transaction.  Dash, Jim and Josh are truly an asset to the company and to the East Texas Community.  Thank you Dash and Josh for your time and expertise in explaining all the features of our new Ford Explorer and to Jim Roberts for a most professional  handling of the paperwork.",5.0
15,"July 03, 2015",One of my better buying experiences.  Will be back!  Not a high pressure sale.....Have been in business for a long time....family owned...small town atmosphere. ..,5.0
16,"July 01, 2015","We have been customers of J.O.'s for many years, but this is the first time I've worked with Josh Johnston. He was wonderful to work with.  I truly appreciate all he did for us.  Thank you Josh!",5.0
17,"June 19, 2015","Thanks Dash, painless experience! well, except for writing the check. Perfect internet sales experience. And just as good in person. I'm glad to see that nothing has changed in the 25 years since I first purchased a car at J.O. ;-)",5.0
18,"June 18, 2015","I am thoroughly pleased with my experience with this dealership. After finding the vehicle I had been looking for online, I called to inquire about the condition and price. I was given an honest assessment of the vehicle and felt comfortable enough with the salesman to purchase the vehicle without a personal inspection. Due to health issues, I was unable to pick up the vehicle myself. The salesman personally delivered the vehicle to my front door for a very reasonable price. The vehicle was exactly as described. It will likely be many years before I purchase another vehicle, but I am *darn* certain that I will buy from this dealership again.

19,"June 16, 2015","This is the best Ford dealership, I've found, to purchase a new Ford truck. There's no ""salesmen going to manager to get a final price"". I believe these men are honest & ethical. From initial start to drive out, the process was great. This is the 3rd Super Duty I've bought from them & my next Ford purchase will be from J. O. Williams. I highly recommend this dealership to all.",5.0
20,"May 21, 2015",I had a great experience with salesperson Josh Johnston. He was so nice and polite and so very honest. He was not a pushy salesmen that I have came across at other dealerships. He was patient on finding what I wanted. I am truly satisfy with my purchase of the Ford Escape. I thank him and other staff at JOWilliams. I truly recommend going there for your purchase of a vehicle. I enjoyed purchasing my vehicle from JO Williams. Thanks again I believe your the best!!!,5.0
21,"March 09, 2015",I had a great experience buying a vehicle from Josh.  He was very nice and enjoyable to talk to.  He made it sooo easy for me too to get everything set up so that I could get the Escape.  He was very quick to get back with me and to keep me informed.  It really was a pleasure to do business with him.  I would definitely go back to J.O. Williams in the future because I had such a great experience with them.,5.0
22,"March 05, 2015","I have known the Finance Manager at J O Williams since high school days.  He represents excellence and honesty, two factors that are essential to me when purchasing a new vehicle.  My salesperson was Josh Johnston and a pure delight to work with in this purchase.  He literally spent over an hour at delivery with me going over virturly ever function of the automobile.  Anyone who has purchased a new vehicle in the last ten years and the proliferation of the computer driven compotents, knows that it is a brave new world.  I appreciate the patience Josh had with me and my less than vigorous learning curve.  I would recommend anyone to J O Williams Ford in Gladewater, Texas.",4.8

25,"April 22, 2010","I have bought several F-series truck from Dash Williams over the past 10 years. They have always been fair in the sales, finance and service departments. I really enjoy the fact that I can go in and get a price without wasting all day with a salesman that has to go see his manager to even give you a price. The service departmant has been great as well, none of this trying to sell you stuff you dont need.",5.0
