0,"April 20, 2020","I would like to share my experience with Neesen Dodge, Chrysler in Kingsville, Texas. I was recently experiencing issues with the HVAC system in my 2015 so I called to schedule an appointment to have it serviced. Keep in mind the Durango only has 6,200 miles since the purchase date in October 2019. This repair was done partially under 36,000 mile extended warranty I purchased through AUL, which is $100 per extended warranty claim. I get a phonecall (04/15/2020) with a diagnosis. Technician stated that the condenser and the suction hose Schrader was leaking and it was NON-REPAIRABLE and had to be replaced and THIS WOULD NOT be covered under extended warranty, which would mean it have to be expensed out of pocket ($126.00). I did not believe this repair one bit or diagnosis, because I know these Schrader Valves are replaceable, just as they would be an any HVAC application....So I asked to keep the parts that A/C Line for self-inspection. So the pictures show that the Schrader Valve was not only removable, BUT REPLACEABLE. This valve core could have easily been replaced for at the least $10. INSTEAD they would rather not look out for the customer and decided to expense me for the cost of the entire line. I do not recommend this dealership for any repairs, even if you have extended warranty. TAKE IT SOMEWHERE ELSE. I will be reporting back to AUL about this experience as well.

 Test drove 2018 Grand Caravan. Was ready to purchase, but 2 useless items added to sales quote..
 Wanted to charge me $750 for ""Auto Butler"" which is simply paint protectant and $150 for glass VIN etching which was already on the van. They refused to remove these items from final price, so I removed myself from these snakes and purchased another Caravan elsewhere.",2.2

6,"August 03, 2018","My and my mother went in to look at some vehicles and was helped out by Hector Deleon. He was referred to by my niece who just bought a vehicle from him. He was very helpful in showing us several vehicles.He also answered questions about the different vehicles which was very helpful in deciding.  It came down to choosing two vehicles between a Chevy Traverse and a Dodge Caravan. We ended up choosing the Dodge Caravan. My nieces that were with us loved the Caravan, they loved the room it has. They spend a lot of time with us so it was good to have their opinion also. We've had the Caravan a couple of days now and it runs great. Thank You to Hector Deleon for the great service and also the staff at Neessen Chrysler Dodge.",5.0

111,"April 26, 2018","Dealer tried to increase the cost of the vehicle after a price was agreed to.  They used adders, extras, and DOC fees.  I was also promised 2 keys and only received one.  They said they would send one when they receive it from the previous owner or make me one if they can't get it.   This would have ",3.7

Pulling into the driveway after leaving our daughter's t-ball game, and my husband telling he destroyed our roast somehow, and that I need to  come out back with him to see it. But little did I know my Ultimate Dream Vehicle was sitting out back while he was on video call with my parents!!!! I cant say enough how happy and excited I am. Once again thank you Eddie and everyone who helped with the sale. You guys were so helpful and so quick with the whole processes with my husband, and then to be able to pick it up and do a beautiful detail the next day, and deliver it back to our home. A million times thank you so much!",5.0

116,"April 23, 2018","I want to thank Eddie, hes was very knowledgeable and very courteous with my wife and I. He kept his word when other dealer salesmen did not. The whole process was under 3 hours but it was a Saturday with little staff. Again I am very happy with the whole sales experience. ",5.0
117,"April 21, 2018",It's not often that dealerships don't give you the run-around but this time was different. I wasn't exactly in the buying mood but after working with Ed he hid no secrets about what to expect and the process to get out of the car I was in and into a new one. I was extremely pleased with the respect and honesty which was a huge reason behind my purchase. Overall I would go back for my next purchase in the future.,5.0

120,"April 11, 2018",My contact with the salesman Abel Contreras was very pleasant. He was knowledgeable about the vehicles we were interested in. He answered all of my questions and explained everything in detail about the Journey.  I wanted a different color that was not in his inventory.  He was able to get me the color I wanted. The sale and financing was done quickly and we were out of the dealership with our new vehicle in no time. I will be returning for future vehicles.,5.0
121,"April 09, 2018","I worked with Eddie Yzaguirre to custom order a Jeep Wrangler. My goal was to make it look like a Jeep I owned that is 18 years old now and was purchased from the same dealership under a previous owner. I wanted my new Jeep to be as simple as possible with no big tires, no tinted window, etc. The color I chose was Tank green, the closest color to my old Jeep.My new Jeep was even custom delivered to the local dealership. Since I plan on keeping my Jeep for as long as I live I decided to purchase the Chrysler Jeep lifetime warranty, which will limit repair costs, if any, once the original warranty expires. What I liked about working with Eddie was that there was no pressure to add features and thereby increase the cost. I wanted what I wanted, and I got what I wanted, thanks to working with Eddie. He even set up my hands free phone service. I also appreciated the service department. They have updated the Jeep's program a couple of times. They get to know the vehicle. I appreciated Eddie's help with my Jeep so much that when he had a temporary stint at the Chevy dealership (same owner as the Dodge dealership) I gave him a budget and said find me a truck. He picked the color and I bought it without even test driving it. Now he is back at Dodge Jeep. Again, no high pressure sales tactics from Eddie. He helped me get what I wanted!!",5.0
122,"April 09, 2018",The only reason I would refer this dealership is for the speed of getting me out Belinder my sales person was easy to work with but I feel I did not get the best possible rate I could have on my purchase so buyers always beware of the finance Dept as they tend to not always be clear on what your going to pay at the end of the day until they present you with the contract . I will have to refinance this vehicle some where else in 12 months do I don’t end up paying too much for the vehicle in the long run,3.2
