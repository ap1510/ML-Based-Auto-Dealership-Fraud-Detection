0,"April 19, 2020","Kia replaced 4 new tires & will replace master window switch under warranty'. My service advisor E.J. Silvas is the best in the business. I've been a Kia customer over 10 yrs and he is the most professional, caring, proficient, quality oriented person that I've dealt with. I'm truly impressed with how he does his job, & Mike Shaw should reward him for his hard work. I'm also impressed with Ben who is doing double duty handling shuttle rides too. Very nice young man. Personable, polite & friendly. I hope these individuals are recognized and rewarded for their hard work. It's employees like these that make a successful company. Kudos to you and all the other dedicated people who continue to work through these challenging times that were in. Keep up the good work. Thank you Mike Shaw Kia for servicing my car. Be safe.

1,"March 03, 2020","ZERO STARS!!!!This is the worst business ever!!!! I live in Dallas TX and my 75 year old grandmother lives in Rockport. She purchased a vehicle from here based on her own judgment. I wish I could've been there to advise her. Never in a million years I would think a business would take advantage of a chronically ill woman with cancer!! Just months after she had it, it broke down on the side of the road unexpectedly leaving her stranded. The mechanic said that it had years of crud that should've been caught by this dealership before they sold it to her! DISGUSTED!!!!! DO NOT BUY FROM THIS DEALERSHIP",1.0

3,"September 12, 2019","Top-notch customer service! Bought my new car in August of this year and from the salesman Benny  to the finance person to the people in the service department and the parts department I have never had anything but courteous service they take the time to listen they answer questions, And I like that because I ask a lot of questions! I feel like they have obviously gone above and beyond in certain circumstances to make sure that I the customer am completely happy. I would highly recommend if you’re looking for a new car or even a used car to check out this dealership because half of the battle in buying a vehicle are the people you have to deal with. I recommend them 100%.  And I love my new Kia Sorrento! Thank you Mike Shaw Kia and staff!!:  ",5.0

6,"February 21, 2019",Mr. Urban was very knowledgeable about the ins and out of selling a vehicle. I had no intention of walking out in a new vehicle because I knew I owed too much on my vehicle to trade in. Mike Shaw Kia and it’s people made that happen for me. I did not come out of pocket. My payments are within my limits and I was treated with high importance. I am now walking away with a brand new 2019 Kia Sportage and I’m in love!!! ,5.0

8,"January 14, 2019","I had a great experience purchasing my vehicle from Mike Shaw Kia and working with Urban.  I did my research and I walked in knowing what I wanted and needed.  I appreciated that there was not a lot of pressure or harassment as I've seen from other dealerships in the area.  I wasn't pressured into trying to spend more or to upgrade into something different than what I initially stated I was looking for.  Urban was very thorough in explaining the features and very patient, I would definitely recommend Mike Shaw and Urban.  It was a 5 Star experience all the way around!",5.0
9,"January 11, 2019","I got a fair offer for my trade in, and a fair price for the vehicle I purchased, but I was unhappy with how I was treated by the faculty.
As soon as they knew I was hooked (ran my credit), both the male sales person and female negotiating manager made me feel as though I were being talked down to, to the point of angering me. This was throughout the buying process and even after the purchase was made, when I picked up the vehicle and realized a small repair needed to be made. 
Multiple times they tried to convince me that the repair did not need to be made, but that I simply didn't know how to work the vehicle. 
They also failed to update me while my car was being fixed. I had to call in to check and see how things were going and whether it was done yet. They had it for several days.

The only person I was happy with was Ashley in Finance.

Overall, I am happy with the vehicle and the price points. I was just very disappointed by the customer service.",2.4
10,"December 30, 2018","As said in the title, booking an appt is useless. They will still service you like a walk in, on top of that they'll sucker you into paying for useless features/updates you can do at home -- of course, they anticipate you don't know that going in. I wish appointment times were honored and prioritized as they should.",2.0
11,"December 30, 2018","Urban Chupe is a great salesman. He worked with me and was very honest and polite. He wanted to make sure that whatever vehicle I chose I would be happy with. I would send anyone looking for a car to Urban. He will do everything in his power to get you in the vehicle you want.

Bill the finance representative was courteous with a positive attitude.

I want to thank Mike Shaw Kia for putting me in a great vehicle!",5.0

I was so disappointed. Took it back. ""Boys"" in sales still attempted to cheat me. Finally asked mgr Kim to intervene n fix the vehicle. Got it back today but not confident it is fix n safe.

84,"September 06, 2018",First off I didn't go in for brakes . They suggested I get new ones . Boy that was a big mistake. First the right side made a loud knocking sound . I told them I didn't feel safe driving it . They said they  couldn't help me or tow it . I would have to drive it or get charged. But it wasn't my mistake to begin with . It took me almost two hours to get there . They said they would have to keep it but I didn't have a way to get to the rental place . No loaners available. So I was stuck for hours without a car and no way to get home . I was upset and angry .So thanks for that. Then it so happens something else goes wrong again after getting it back . Finally they came and got it . I was going to trade my car for another kia but after the service . I'll think I'll go else where.

The day of the appointment the service department said the actual switch wasn't working and they didn't have the switch available. They said the part would be available in three days.

(At least I could afford it until the contract was changed days later). Mr Sebastianin no way involved with the rest of my review. 
            OF COURSE THE PUBLIC MAY NEVER KNOW
.
   This is the WORSE place I have ever done business with. I enter a signed contract with them to buy a car with payments of $244.+ A half a month into the deal I receive a call from them stating that the lender ""kicked back"" on the deal and wanted a shorter pay period and that my payments were going DOWN. Sounded too good to be true but I was happy as this is an older car and higher mileage than I wanted. They rushed to San Antonio where I had picked up my mother who was released from the hospital after a heart attack to resign the papers. The gentleman just pulled them from my hands and left.  I was not able to read them and I was actually taking my mom back to the hospital when he knocked on the door. I also did not receive a copy. I got news today that my payments are now $338.00+. When I went to confront them. The manager then told me ""No I told you the payments were going up"" I so beg to differ! When I was buying the car I TOLD THEM I COULD NOT AFFORD $300.00 PAYMENTS. I WAS TOLD ""NO PROBLEM  THEY WILL BE $244.+. 
  THEY RENIGGED AND NOW I'M TOLD ""I GUESS WE WILL BE REPOSSESSING THE CAR"". 
I feel I have been swindled.  Be VERY CAREFUL IF YOU BUY ANYTHING FROM THEM. And shame on me for falling for the line ""we will do whatever it takes to get you in a car today."" Yeah only to screw you later without even a kiss.  And yes. I'm mad as all get out!",1.0

       I was there late, salesman said he would give me a call when I could bring the car in to have it washed and try to pop out a few small dents.   Never received that call.  
        My experience their was horrible.  I will never recommend this dealship.  Purchasing a vehicle cost a lot. Look elsewhere for the right dealership.  Buying from someone you trust goes along way.  So if your new a buyer, stay away from Mike Shaw Kia.

Mike Shaw Kia - lied, told me I was approved for a 2013 Kia Sorento. Had me call to convert my insurance, then an hour later I still do not have the vehicle. Now we are ""waiting on the bank??"" They try to keep you there for hours...I finally left with 2 salesmen chasing me out to my car. A manager calls me the next day for my ""appointment""...never calls back. I call the salesman, never a return call back...buh bye...

All Star Mitsubishi - they have a friendly staff...but...they tried to force me into a car I did not want. I came back the next day, a different sales guy said he would assist...later tells me I am approved and they are just waiting on details from the bank...2 weeks later, I still have not heard back although I am approved??? Buh bye...

Ed Hicks Nissan - got approved, they wanted way to much money down...I could have just bought the car outright. A staff member texts me a week later and asks if I am still in the market, I immediately reply I am - still have not heard back??? Buh bye...

CC Subaru - tells me they have over 150 cars...visit the website, see the inventory...calls me later in the day and states, they have selected a car FOR ME, the website is not always accurate and I should not use it to pick a car??? I never even went back...already been lied to..buh bye....

AUTONATION FORD - I dealt with Bill in Sales and Trent in Finance - they made me feel like a top notch customer from the start. I looked at 2 vehicles, they qualified me for both WITHIN 10 MINUTES!!!!! No games, no waiting, no anticipation, no mystery bank with long approval times and conditions...just honest answers. Period. Within 2 hours, I left with a newer, more expensive vehicle with less miles and a lower payment than the other dealerships. They are upfront with all communication, there is never a question because they tell you where you are through every step of the process...I actually learned a little bit and I am a seasoned buyer. They listen to the customer. 

I will only use AutoNation Ford and never again waste time elsewhere. I hope this helps someone...I am an actual customer. I will send you my contact info if you need it...I am not a bored salesman like I have seen All Star Mitsubishi do in the past...shame on ya'll...ANF4L. ",1.8

We did not feel comfortable doing this and in the end we had to return our brand new car and get our trade in back.

169,"August 06, 2014","Where do I even start? Since the beginning this dealership has been nothing but a problem! I recently financed a car with Mike Shaw Kia and I regret it so much. I made a deal with them to trade in my mazda as my downpayment and they said they would give me $1,000 without even looking at it and since it was late they let me drive the Hundai home that night and come back the next day with my trade in and to do the paperwork. The Mazda was in bad shape and didn't make it to corpus so I sold it to a buddy of my dad's for the $1,000 that we had agreed on as a down payment. When I arrived at the dealership with the money and ready to sign for my car the sales manager Roy Davilla asked where the Mazda was and I explained to him the situation. He was beyond furious and wasn't embarrassed at all to show it! I was appalled because I thought the deal was $1,000 downpayment, or the car which was of ""equal value"". I then realized why he was so mad. They were going to fix my car and get so much more out of it than just the $1,000 that they were offering me as comparison to the $1,000 cash that I had brought to the table. From then on they were nothing but rude to the point where they almost started to yell, and were not cooperative at all at making a deal. I ended up getting so frustrated and annoyed because the Sonata was exactly what I was looking for and I needed a car for school ASAP, so I ended up with a HUGE monthly payment that is WAYYYY over the budget we had agreed on and the final price of my car was more than doubled. They also forgot to ask for my check stub when we were doing the financing paperwork and told me 3 weeks later that if I didn't give them the check stub that they would come pick my car up that day! I am very unhappy with the service of this company. I wish I had read the reviews before making a deal with them. ",1.0
170,"December 27, 2013","I have purchased a Truck from them ... My Truck has been in the shop for the past 5 weeks out of 9 that I have owned it ... I am already out of pocket an additional 3,000$ and the truck is in the shop again now adding up to 800$  I have already made a payment and now lost revenue with work cause this is a business truck ... When contacting my sales consultant she refereed me to the service manager Kyle and she also sent me an invoice of all the work the dealer had put into the truck prior to me purchasing totaling over 5300$ in work ... Kyle and I spoke once and he told me he would call me back the next morning at 10 am ... No call so I called him, to get pushed to his vm everyday for the past week and a half ...  The work the dealership did has failed  included a turbo that blew up less than 2 weeks later this was a 1500$ Part not including labor ... Then the IPR is now blown and they replaced this before purchase as well , The new Mechanic said they left a plastic plug in and it got into the IPR and ruined it this is 300$ part plus labor ....  This company has avoided me . The Burden of the costs and not having my vehicle has made me cancel a trip to see family now for Thanksgiving and Christmas ... This truck has drained my savings and is preventing me from working ... But the payments keep coming and the dealership wont stand with their product ....  I clearly stated my intentions of using my truck for work and asked if it was in good shape , They told me that the only thing it need was a part for the fuel line , They never told me all this work was done to this truck till the salesman sent the invoice ... It was certified buy their service department ...  Beware Certifications don't mean diddlysquat .... !  This Vehicle was not purchased as a fixer upper at the cost of 27k ....  BEWARE OF THIS DEALER !

I was informed they buy their cars through auctions and repair them with re-manufactured parts and put a cert sticker on them and send them to be sold ... My Mechanic said the parts didnt look new and they looked as if they were used they had been worn so bad ... Suggested a possible junk yard parts .... Good luck with any purchases here ! 

This wouldn't have been an issue if they would have responded and stood by their work .... Stuff happens .... But I have now been ignored for the past week and a half and no one is honoring a thing .... My Sales person as of a week ago no longer works here and I pray this has nothing to do with her helping me ....  Im not sure of the route that should be taken at this point but i wont stop here ....  Good luck and please dont ignore this post ! For your own sake ! ",1.4

173,"November 04, 2013","Manuel Benavides was Awesome from the day I called the dealership.  He encouraged me to test drive a Kia Cadenza and I was floored when he brought the test drive to me.  He was both friendly and professional and knew the in's and out's of the vehicle well, answering all of my questions in detail.  Even after I told him that I was leaning towards the 2014 Honda Accord, he never gave up trying to win my confidence and business.  He called me up about 10 days after the test drive and invited me to visit with him and the staff at Mike Shaw Kia.  It was a great experience.  Everyone was friendly and helpful.  In fact I was met by someone before I even exited my vehicle.  Much gratitude goes to Bob Bruton for working tirelessly to help me stay within my budget.  I got a fantastic deal.  Travis Brownlee helped with some technical in's and out's as I prepared to take possession of my new Kia.  Many thanks for his time and support.  And Chad Payne was also friendly and fast as well as professional as he walked me through the leasing process and paperwork.  Overall, I have never been treated with more respect and will definitely tell my family, friends and co-workers to visit Mike Shaw Kia and to ask for ""Manny"" Benavides.",5.0

Several months back, I contacted  you regarding a vehicle I purchased from your Kia lot in Corpus Christi.  As I’m sure your aware, this has been a long drawn out ordeal.  I’d like to inform you of the fantastic customer service I have received.  

Joe, in Service, kept in contact with me and was always pleasant.  Kyle got the ball really rolling to figure out what we needed to do to end this nightmare.  I truly thank him!  Wade is a fantastic salesman.  Friendly, knowledgeable, always pleasant, even when I wasn’t!.    John stepped in to be a real team player and show me vehicles when Wade was assisting another customer.  Mike and Golden handled financing in a fast and efficient way.  And last, but certainly not least, Craig!  A true example of a good team leader!  Bent over backwards to satisfy an unhappy customer.  

In the end,  I ended up with a vehicle I am pleased with.  Your staff made a very unpleasant experience tolerable by staying professional and friendly!  I commend you for hiring competent well trained individuals!  I will defiantly recommend friends and family to shop at Mike Shaw Kia!

Thank you for providing top quality service and sales!

181,"March 25, 2013","I'm not your average car buyer.  I've been around the block and have learned several things when it comes to purchasing/leasing vehicles. I also understand the lingo and tactics that salesmen are accustomed to using.  I am the type of person that is willing to open and close down the dealership until I get my deal done the way I want it done.   So, the experience I had at Mike Shaw KIA totally took me by surprise. 

I drove over 150 miles hoping that my car buying experience was going to be great.  To my surprise, it was definitely worth the drive!  I have dealt with dealerships and salesmen from Honda, GM, Ford, Dodge, Pontiac, Nissan, Chevy, BMW, Land Rover, and Toyota throughout the years of buying cars.  Never did I ever expect to receive the 5-star treatment that I received at Mike Shaw KIA.  

I spoke with the internet sales person, Kala (Robin) Greer, prior to driving over to Corpus Christi.  Everything we had discussed over the phone was exactly as she had stated it was.  She didn't try the typical sales ""reel 'em in"" approach.  She didn't even do the ole' ""bait and switch"", when we arrived at KIA.  She was 100% honest and up front with every detail over the phone.  Everyone we met at KIA had a big smile on their face and said hello. Even though the dealership was ""busy"" with activity, every sales person, secretary, and manager said hello and made us feel important.  

Normally when you enter the ""den"" of the sales department, a customer can tend to feel uneasy and ready for the ""deal"" to fight to the death! However, Mike Shaw KIA was different in every way.  I never felt pressured to make the purchase at anytime.  There weren't any ""games"" between the sales and financial aspect of the process.  Everything was spelled out clearly in front of me.  

We also had the pleasure of meeting and working with Victoria ""Tori"" Hammond.  She is the New Car Sales Manager.  We both worked hard to get the price where it was a fair deal for both parties involved.   No strings attached, no gimmicks, no fuss.  She's a great spunky individual and has great stories to tell along the way. She takes pride in her product, her dealership, and her job.   

In the finance room we had the pleasure of working with Chad Payne to finalize the paperwork.  He's a very nice guy and is definitely down to Earth.  He's the kind of guy you want to go fishing with and turn on the grill while you kick back and just hang out.  He was very thorough and patient in finalizing the financial aspect of the sale.  

At the end of the sale, Kala Greer walked us through all the amenities and technological aspects about our ""new"" car.  She was extremely thorough and was ready to answer every question we threw her way.  

I hope everyone who is looking for a fair and comfortable deal in South Texas will give Mike Shaw KIA in Corpus Christi a try.   I had the best car buying experience I have ever had.  I will definitely be recommending several of my friends to visit this dealership in the future. There was only one thing I forgot to do before leaving the dealership........I forgot to hit the big gong they have in front after making my purchase!!! Thanks to all who I had the pleasure of working with that evening.

183,"December 03, 2012","I feel that the whole world should know about my experience at Mike Shaw Kia. From the first phone call I received from  Kevin Martin, He went out of his way to make my car buying experience a comfortable one. He was very polite. Very attentive to my every need. He greeted me at the door with a smile and Hello and Welcome. He let me know step by step what was going on. He made sure I was comfortable. Every roadblock I encountered, he had the answers to help me clear the path. I walked into Mike Shaw Kia, thinking I would leave there with a big let down. Kevin made sure that I left there with a smile on my face and a Beautiful new car. The rest of the staff who helped me were equally friendly and helpful. Everybody wished me Happy Birthday.

186,"August 25, 2012","Mr. James,

Too often people seem too quick to complain about an unpleasant experience and too slow, if ever, to commend a wonderful one.

I would be remiss if I did not write to tell you about just such an experience I had at Mike Shaw Kia in Corpus Christi.  From the time I called the dealership for pricing to the timely way I was called back, I felt at ease.  

Monica Semuda (Sales) was friendly and informative.  She never once made me feel (as I have at other dealerships) that I was just another customer in a long list of customers.  I never felt hurried or harassed.

Victoria Hammond (Floor Manager) made my wife and I feel at ease immediately and when the Sorento I wanted was not in stock, worked ceaselessly to locate one.  She kept us informed throughout.

It was also a pleasure to meet Mike Andruzzi (General Sales Manager).  I found him to be, not only friendly but informative and helpful as well.  Being in business myself, I know how difficult it is to find someone to manage the many aspects of the business and still keep focus on the customers and their wants and needs.  Believe me when I say that he has a rare gift.

 Last but not least, Golden Gonzalez (Business Manager) made sure that I understood the entire financing paperwork.  He answered my questions, allowed me to see how certain changes would affect my monthly payment and/or interest payments.  He made sure I understood that entire process.

After all was said and done, my wife told me, “This is the most pleasant car buying experience we have ever had in our 30 years of marriage.”  I most heartily agree.

Thank you for assembling such a great team, and thank you for this experience. I have already recommended and will continue to recommend your dealership in the future.

Very truly yours,

Daniel Luis
