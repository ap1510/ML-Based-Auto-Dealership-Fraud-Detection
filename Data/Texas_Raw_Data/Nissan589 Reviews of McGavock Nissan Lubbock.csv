Lesson  Learned never but any warranty no matter what they say it's covered cuz the only thing that's covered is everything that won't go out and Richard Williams was the one that sold me that warranty but for real is it worth ripping people off like that I advise everyone not to buy any warranty ever because that's your loss out your pocket they won't be seeing me there ever again

270,"January 30, 2017","I posted a review on thier website and I noticed it was taken off.  I bought a 2011 Nissan Armada on 01/21/2017 and the salesman was Stetson Bailey.  The vehicle had 79259 miles on it and had mismatched tires on the front, scratches throughout, and the front end might have needed an alignment.the vehicle was being sold as is so I was very sceptical about buying it but Stetson said they would put the same tires on the front as the back had and a front end alignment would be done, it would be detailed and buffed to remove most minor scratches and he would fill the tank up.  I agreed to this so he said the tires would have to be ordered and to bring it back when the tires came in so as to do what was agreed upon.  He notified me Tuesday evening to let me know the tires were in.  On Wednesday I took the vehicle in to the service department at 8 am sharp.  Stetson told me that it would take two days to do what was agreed on.  I thought that was a long time but he said there was a lot to do.  I left it there later that day at approximately 530 pm I called to check on my vehicle, no one knew anything about my vehicle.  I decided to drive there to see what was going on and as I approached the parking lot I saw my vehicle parked in the front.  I was inspecting my vehicle when he came out and asked what I was doing I told him what happened on the phone he got very defensive and said he had told me it would take two days.  I did noticed that the two front tires had been installed and I asked if that was all they had done all day.  Then I noticed two new scratches and when I was trying to show him he said ""Oh here we go"" and turn his back on me and left.  He then came back out and said it would be ready the next day early afternoon.  The next day I called him at 130 pm and he immediately became defensive by saying he had said it would be ready between 5 and 6 pm more six then five.  He then said that he didn't understand why I was belly aching so much.  That upset me very much and told him that I paid a total of 22000 dollars and that I should be driving it instead of him keeping it two days.  He hung up on me while I was talking.  I then called to speak with a manager but was hung up on me while waiting.  Stetson called me back and told me why I was the way I was because everyone loves him.  I told him I just wanted my vehicle.  He said fine and he would have it ready when he said.  I asked him if he could send someone to get me and he said no.  I had to wait for my wife to get home from work to take me there.  When we got there he wasn't there so we had to wait for him.  After awhile I saw him driving up in my vehicle and we went out to look at it.  I noticed water was dripping off the vehicle.  I had to go inside the dealer to talk to him because he just left my wife and me by the vehicle.  I told him to tell me the truth and I wouldn't be upset, I asked him if all he did was take it through the car wash.  He became defensive again and kept saying that 
The tires had been changed.  Which I acknowledged but what I was asking was that it had not been detailed and buffed.  He was so rude that I finally said I had enough and wanted to talk to a manager.  When a manager came out he asked what the problem was and I began to explain but he just wanted to know if I had bought a new car and I told him no it was a 2011 and he kept asking me what year then he wanted to know how many miles it had at that time I asked him what that had to do with what my complaint was and he said because it's an old car and it would have scratches on it.  I then asked him if he was a manager because I had never been treated like he was treating me and he said he was Mcgavok himself.  My wife said to me let's just go at which time we did as we drove off we both looked back and saw them laughing at us.  Today is Monday and I repaired a chip on the windshield, which he said he would get fixed, I washed it detailed it and buffed out most of the scratches which took me 3 and half hours to do.  Instead of them doing what they said they would they instead chose to disrespect a 20 year veteran and not do what they agreed on.  It would have taken them less then half a day to do as promised and made a customer happy.  I posted this review on their website but I noticed they took it off.

289,"November 15, 2016","I wrote a review after purchasing a used vehicle in March 2016. I felt like we had a fairly positive experience buying from McGavock Nissan but after 6 months of owning this vehicle I've come to realize they are all talk and do not care about their customers. I was unfortunately in a rush to buy and even though I thought I found the right vehicle it has come to my attention that many things were left out of our conversations with the sales representative. As soon as we were done purchasing we started to have a bad feeling about it. We were told it was cleaned upon arrival - it very obviously wasn't. So, we had the service guys ""clean"" it before leaving. Upon arriving home and figuring out how all the seating and back lift gate works, we discovered it STILL had not been thoroughly cleaned. I'm not talking a few missed spots. The service department clearly just did a surface clean to get the car out the door. I figured, well, whatever... Then, after driving this vehicle over the weekend after purchasing, I realized the tires needed rotating, ok...went to have that done. Come to find out, the tires had never been replaced and I was told I was basically lucky to have driven safely at all in the few days of owning it. So, I am not only buying brand new tires now, but the service guys never even thought to rotate them, and they had probably never been rotated in 5 years of previous ownership. I feel this is something the service department should catch. We have been to a local repair shop now 4 times in 6 months for various issues that didn't show up on initial test driving. Today I received news that the vehicle had obviously been in an accident under previous ownership that had required the entire passenger side rebuilt. This would explain why it suddenly rattles all over the passenger side doors when driving above 50 mph. I've seen what our repair shop is talking about and I believe it to be true. I'm not a car person, I never would have thought to check. I feel it is completely unethical for McGavock Nissan to have sold this vehicle at least without disclosing this information.  They have the absolute worst attention to detail. I realize absolutely no one at McGavock gives a hoot about this as I'm the one who drove off with this vehicle. BUT it is worth saying that these individuals never cared once if we were safe leaving in the vehicle or if we were ultimately satisfied with the customer service. They got their sale and that's all that matters to them. I have owned 2 other vehicles from this manufacturer, one used and one brand new, and have NEVER had problems with them.

294,"October 27, 2016",I purchased a Nissan Altima two years ago from Steve Green.  I decided I wanted to upgrade and knew I wanted to deal with Macgavock again but more importantly I wanted to see Steve Green the salesman that helped me the first time.  I purchased a 2016 NIssan Murano from Steve Green at McGavock and couldn't be happier.  He helped me the first time around newly divorced and treated me like family and made sure I made the right decision as a newly single female and made sure I did not exceed my financial limitations.  I went there for a Maxima and he talked me out of it because I was in an upside down situation thanks to Reagor Dykes Auto Group.  He found a new vehicle that was better for my budget and I loved it.  I was so thankful that he took the time to sell me the right car rather than make more commission putting me in a car with a higher sticker price.  So when I was ready to trade up now newly married and way better credit score I knew where I needed to go.  Thank you Steve Green and MacGavock for your superior customer service from finding the right vehicle to making the financing process easy and stress free with Richard Williams.  When I am ready to trade I will be back!,5.0

She got me the best deal, through schooling on my new Murano.  It just felt right and she was so easy to talk with as I love a little small talk on side.

The other dealerships where only going to give me $15,000. for my 2008 Ford Explorer sports Trac and they did not have what I had been looking for on their lots. When my husband and I pulled up to the dealership at  Mcgavock Nissan we did not have to wait for someone to come out to greet us. I can say at the other two we went to before we came there did not do this. We had to wait 30 minutes for someone to great us at the other dealerships; so we got upset and left on of them. The salesman at Mcgavock Nissan was really friendly and did not waist our time on getting us a GREAT deal. We came to look at cars and to see if anyone would make a deal with us for an EVEN trade. I am happy to say Mcgavock Nissan made happen. My husband and I were praying on the way to Lubbock for God to help me find what I always wanted. I have always told him that I wanted a Nissan Altima that was a 2012 or higher with low miles than my truck had. HAPPY JUST HAPPY WITH THIS DEALER SHIP!! I RECOMMEND THEM FULLY!!!!!

492,"July 27, 2014","This is our third Nissan from this dealership.  All of the sales were excellent.  With this vehicle, we had a few minor issues.  The vehicle seemed to float as I drove it down the road, the in cabin thermometer showed Impossible temperatures (185 degrees) the rear drivers' door is difficult to shut, and the doors automatically lock when you get to about 15 MPH.  We waited to get 3,000 miles on the vehicle to get the repairs.  We called the dealership to see if we needed an appointment, and they advised to drop it off in the morning.  My wife dropped off the vehicle in the morning, and explained the issues.  We called about 6 hours later, and were told the vehicle was almost ready.  We went to the dealership, to find out that in the 6 hours they had only done the service (oil change) on the vehicle.  I was sent back and forth between the service desk and the cashier twice before being told that the vehicle was not ready.  We left, with the understanding that they would call when the vehicle was ready.  We called them again 30 minutes before they closed, and were told ""we were just getting ready to call you"".  When we got to the dealership, I was again passed back and forth between the service desk and the cashier before they found my keys.  The service manager told me that they had checked the alignment of the vehicle, and made minor adjustments to it.  The thermometer had to have time to adjust after the vehicle was started.  The door  seemed to close fine to them, and the door locks were set from the factory and could not be changed.  I could accept the door lock situation, even though I do not like it.  The thermometer was displaying 185 degrees while driving down the road.  The door still does not close well, without slamming it shut.  Overall, I am not satisfied with the ""service"" I received, or the way we were treated overall with being told our vehicle was almost ready when it was not, or being shuffled between the service desk and the cashier on both of our attempts to pick up  our vehicle.",1.6

Apparently everyone else in Abilene had the same idea we did as the sales floor was standing room only.

My husband suggested a Maxima, which I had never considered, and didn't really think that I could be swayed away from the Taurus.  But After looking at and driving the Volkswagon Passat and CC, we went to McGavock.

We were greeted immediately by Daniel Kinsey.   I immediately liked him--- he was friendly and not at all the typical ""pushy"" car salesman.  We told him what we were looking for, and off he went, finding a white Maxima without leather seats!  Next thing I knew, we were in the car off on a drive.  Daniel told us the features of the car, but again, not in a pushy manner.

A few hours later, we drove off the lot in our new car.  Daniel worked very hard that day for us....even set up the blue tooth for me.   I'm loving my new car...my first after years of driving a ""Mommy wagon"".   ",5.0

I did checkout other dealerships but coming home  I stopped back at McGavock and asked more questions which he gladly answered. I came home discussed our options with my son and husband and gave Tom a call to get the ball rolling. All was good:)
  
Paperwork was done by Scott Parr who patiently discussed Gap Insurance and extended warranty. We negotiated prices and came up with something my son could afford. I would definitely recommend McGavock for anyone looking for a deal for a student or for themselves.

This was not our first time to purchase from McGavock Nissan of Abilene and I gurantee it won't be our last.

I was not really in the market to buy but also not happy with the gas mileage of my current Nissan Armada. We stopped by to see our friends at McGavock and were able to test drive both the Maxima and Pathfinder. Carl explained both cars features, and differences with patience and understanding. Carl and Jay allowed us to take the Pathfinder for the weekend and after much discussion we decided to buy. I went back on Monday to complete the deal and told Carl I only had one hour until a conference call for work. He had me in and out in 45 minutes! Now that is amazing service.
