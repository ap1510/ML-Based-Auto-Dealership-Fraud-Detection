4,"July 09, 2013",We went to Allen Samuels because our truck broke down on the hwy. we were in a road trip from San Antonio to New York we ended up in Waco and went to Allen Samuels. We waited overall about 6 hours just for them to change a fuel filter and some fuel lines. They told us the problem was fixed. But in Dallas it broke down again. I will never go back to Allen Samuels or recommended to anyone. They did a very bad job ,2.2
5,"March 12, 2007","Had tires rotated as part of service.  Several weeks later had a flat tire.  The lug nuts were so tight I could not break them loose.  I was in a bad part of town and it was starting to get late.  I had the truck towed to a nearby tire shop.  They rounded off all of the lug nuts while getting them off.  They found two lugs were stretched.  They had to replace the lugs and all of the lug nuts.  While they had the truck on the hoist I asked them to back off the lugs on the other tires with more of the same results.  I had to replace all but three lug nuts and five lugs.  The total bill was $50 for parts and labor.  Allen Samuels has yet to contact me after I complained.  I have purchased several vehicels there and had all of my service performed there, but not any more.",1.8
6,"July 17, 2006","As far as sales go, Allen Samuels is the best dealer I have ever seen. I got there at 7:30pm test drove a few cars and realized they were closed. I explained my desperate need for a vehicle after an accident and they did everything they could to see if they could work me a deal on an '06 Cobalt. The next morning, to my suprise, they actually called me when they said they would. I was approved (I have no credit) and worked out a low downpayment and VERY low monthly payment deal for me. They were even patient with me when my insurance company screwed up my policy. I would highly reccoment that people who may have trouble getting a loan elsewhere try this place, they work as hard as they can to get you a deal you can afford.

As far as parts and service go the only experience I had with them so far was waiting for them to service my car before I could take it off the lot. This did take longer than my paperwork, I would say around 2-3 hours but they were very busy and I could understand why it might take a while.",4.3
7,"December 09, 2004","I purchased a 2005 Corvette on which they installed the front license plate holder, I noted that I was not happy with the installation because of gaps between the holder and the body of 1/16 inch varying to 7/32 inch.I was told that they installed it per the Chevrolet instructions and therefore it must be correct. Everyone at this dealership is very friendly but there appears to be a total absence of after sales concern or support.Buy it there but find someplace to do everything that does not come from the factory installed.",2.5
