0,"May 18, 2020","The finance manager doing our paperwork asked us to purchase an extended warranty at a fantastic price, we declined!  He was very pushy and we declined 3 more times before we had to say NO!  He became obviously angry and very rude.  We wrote our check and we were happy to just leave.  Not getting five minutes down the road, we were called back because the paperwork was all messed up, his fault and the entire contract had to be redone.  A couple weeks later we received our title in the mail.  It showed our brand new 2020 330I to have 108 thousand miles on it!!  The car we purchased CASH only had 18 miles when we drove it off the lot.  We contacted BMW of Temple to have them correct the mistake that THEY made and we were told sorry, you will need to go to the DMV and surrender your title and apply for a new one.  Biggest hassle EVER!  Over four hours of my time to take care of the finance mangers angry mistake just because we did not take him up on his extended warranty offer!  Love the new BMW but should have stuck with Mercedes!  This issue has been very frustrating, time consuming and extremely unprofessional on the dealerships part.  ",1.0
1,"January 29, 2020","When I purchased my BMW, I bought the GAP Ins. I traded in my vehicle , so I requested my GAP Ins Refund and sent in the paperwork that I was told to do so that I could receive my check with in 6 weeks and it has been 5 months and I still have not received it. I have contacted the dealer and the finance department and all they tell me is that it's on the way. If anyone knows what else to do so I can get me check, COMMENT BACK!!!!!!! PLEASE......",1.8
2,"October 20, 2019",I walked into BMW of Temple and had my eye on a beautiful Mercedes.I was greeted with excellent customer service when was introduced to Trevor as my salesman. He exceeded my expectations  The process of getting approved was appeased by the personable Trevor. He made the process easy and comfortable to deal with. I recommend anyone to BMW of Temple for their next vehicle purchase for a top notch experience!,5.0
3,"May 21, 2019","I called BMW of Temple and immediately was greeted with what I could tell was a smiling person on the other end of the phone.  I believe their calls go to a main source so no call is ever missed.  Scheduling an appointment is always a breeze, I wouldn't take my BMW anywhere else.  I have worked with Cat, Kaitlyn, and  Bart - all of which are exceptionally knowledgable on products as well as honest and take pride and integrity in their work.  ",5.0

6,"October 07, 2017","I was very pleased with my experience. The staff members that I dealt with were friendly and accommodating. They were not pushy at all and listened very carefully to what I wanted. They have also checked up on me after my purchase. Anytime I have a question I can easily reach out to them and get a speedy response. I would highly recommend purchasing a car from this dealership, and I look forward to doing business with them in the future.",5.0
7,"October 06, 2017","I own a couple of BMWs and have leased a couple more. I have had recalls and repairs taken care of at GS and Bart and the repair staff were great. Got a loaner one day and a shuttle another day. Maybe I'm just lucky, but my cars have never needed repair although I spend more than most people on periodic maintenance.

I leased from GS in 2015 and again in 2017, working with Terrence and Drew. They did not have a vehicle configured as I wanted it on the lot, so they listened to what I wanted and did not try to push me into a vehicle they had on hand. It took a week or so but they found a vehicle that was built the way I wanted, and arranged to have it transferred for me with a reasonable deposit. The deal we arranged was fair and I took delivery a few days later. Landon and Jake were a pleasure to deal with and I expect to lease from GS again in a few years when they have moved into the new building. . ",5.0
8,"September 19, 2017",This drive was worth it! This is the 3rd BMW dealership I went and it's true the third time was the charm! I experienced great customer service and transparency. Zach was very interested in what I wanted; making sure it was an uncomplicated transaction. At Gary Shelton they work with you for the best deal. The sales and finance department are motivated to get you what you want not to meet a quota. I went to turn in my BMW and move onto another manufacturer ... instead I left with a great BMW and a great experience.,4.8

10,"June 21, 2017",I bought aused car jeep from a dealer in BMW temple tx. A year ago how ever finance person who sells a car warranty has a problem with a used car even if it is later. So if you buy a car warranty right now from a dealer. You can deal like repair new car. Most   all repair is warranty company pay. But  my car is problem alot so I took the car repair shop. I did not got much help. I paid alot money and I believef that. I bought it. I complent with the BMW dealer shop but until now there is no any responses. Just be careful of those dealers who even lie to sell warranty.,1.0
