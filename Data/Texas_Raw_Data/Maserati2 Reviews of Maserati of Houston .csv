0,"July 31, 2018",Helfman Maserati is a horrible dealership they have poor customer service and they do not treat they customers with the treatment a 100k car ownership should get!! My car has been in shop for 5 months now!! The technicians are incompetent they went thru 3 service managers on my car case that they fired for incompetence. Report them so maserati can do better with they dealerships!,1.0
1,"December 20, 2014","I just bought a brand new Maserati Quattroporte and was driving it around when my 'check engine' light went on. Upon scheduling an appointment I wasn't given a loaner car, and in the five days since they have not even looked at it. While I understand that this time of year is busy, I expected much better service after paying through the nose for a luxury car. Very disappointed. ",1.0
