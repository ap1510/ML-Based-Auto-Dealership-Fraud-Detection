At first the sales person Hector was nice but as soon as he closed the deal with me he was a totally different person; arrogant and rude. I got a call 2 weeks later to ask how the car was so I told him that the vehicles inspection sticker was expired 03-10 bought the car in May (that sticker should have been taken care of before they let me drive off in it); he said he was going to talk to the manager and NEVER called me back. I took care of that myself. They need customers to make money so I DO NOT understand why they lack customer service. Used or new its a sale, right!? I WILL NOT recommend anyone to them. Not nice!",1.2
1,"May 30, 2010","My husband and I went in to see the Audi Q7. We were immediately greeted by a nice and so I thought knowledgeable salesman named Kenny.  He immediately offered to take us on a test drive and was very helpful settling in my littlest one in his car seat.  He explained about the car in detail.  The test drive itself was the best part.  After that everything went downhill.  I told Kenny that I liked the test driven car but wanted a black one with dark interior.  He informed me that this was the only one available (with light interior) and we would have to see about the black one.  He did try his best to sell us on the one we test drove (brown exterior and light interior) but I made it clear and he eventually got that we wanted a different color. As we drove back to the dealership, we immediately saw a black Q7 inside the dealership which was not there before.  I was excited even though the interior was not exactly what I normally go for. Kenny tells us it just came in but it was a ""demo"" with about 12000 miles. So we immediately sit down and Kenny says right away that he will not be a ""pushy salesperson and will be straight with us during the dealing process.""  An hour and a half later (way past closing time) he comes back with a deal.  My husband makes some changes and Kenny comes back with what we think is the final deal.  Then my husband and I noticed that this Q7 is really a fully loaded diesel version (which is considerably more)...the funny thing is is that the salesperson nor his boss knew that it was a fully loaded diesel!  So we sat for another hour while the deal was being discussed and then my husband signs 
the paper and they send us home with the Q7.  Since it was closing and their finance manager was gone for the day, they asked us to return to sign the paperwork the next day at a time convenient for us.  My husband came in to sign the paperwork and it is still not ready.  Also, he is given a manual for the Q7 and spare keys.  When we open the package at home we realize the manual and spare key is to the wrong car!!!  My husband makes an appointment for Tuesday so they can detail and fix a few minor cosmetic issues with the car that we noted. A few days later when we return to sign the paperwork we are greeted by the sales manager Fred who informs us that Kenny is no longer with the company (poss related to our situation, don't know) and says that the car was not a loaner.  We leave with a loaner (a beat up Avalon) and still aren't given any paperwork to sign. We think to ourselves, ok so they are a bit slow and unorganized but we love the car and they have accepted our trade in so we are good to go.  Then a few days later when we are to get our Q7 we get a call from the sales manager saying they can't honor the deal on the used Q7 diesel but if interested we can make a new deal on the one we test drove (which we didn't like the color).  So my husband, fed up with the run around asked for our trade in back and left.  I highly recommend Audi, great car and value.  You get more for your money than the ""others"" for sure but please venture south to Momentum Audi.  We left Momentum with a wonderful experience and that is where we will be purchasing our new Audi.",1.2
2,"March 11, 2010","Walked in to dealer salesman came up and right away was cold and unprofessional. Talked bad about BMW, Mercedes etc. 
I came in to look at this brand of car for first time and man it will be my last. Went to talk to Salesmanager about his unprofessionalism and alls he could say is that he was trying to educate me.  I have been a mystery shopper and if I got this dealership for an assignment they would get a Failure in customer service so I hope this owner takes a look at this review and sends some shoppers in so he can find out he is loosing customers and in this economic time he should really change Management and some staff.

3,"November 16, 2009","This is my first experience buying a car ""sight unseen"" and certainly will not be my last from Millenium Audi. 
David handled communications and negotiation and we felt very secure speaking to him especially when he did a virtual walk around the vehicle with detailed pictures of any scratch and blemish.
We gave him a deposit, he sent us a purchase order invoice and the ball began to roll. 
Phil handled paperwork and coordination of the details involving getting our car delivered to our door in the west coast.
Everything was done timely, accurately and we would highly recommend this dealership to our friends and family.
Our oldest daughter's birthday is coming soon and we are considering doing it again.
Why did we not buy from our local dealer? Selection, no pressure, great price and no extra fees.",4.8
4,"July 21, 2009","I have purchased two Audi vehicles from them. I first bought the A5 last April when they came out and traded it in for an S6 a few months after. The people were very friendly and knowledgeable about their products. I myself do research before purchasing a vehicle. I have owned a Subaru STI, Volvo S80, Mercedes E 55 and I have not felt the same warm welcome in any of those places as I do at Millenium. 

Their sales team changes from time to time, but David Viera and Phil are very good at what they do and I would reccommend you talk to them for new or used vehicles. 

Their service department is very good with customer service as well as mechanical work. I take my car there for maintenance and they work quickly. Their shop is always clean. That says good things about their employees. 

Sorry some of you guys have not had a good experience there. I have dealt with many dealers from many different brands and Millenium makes you feel like a person and not just a customer number.  ",4.8
5,"July 20, 2009","Avoid this dealership.  Unprofessional, arrogant, and ill-informed about their own product line (I admit, I do a lot of research before entering a dealership).  If you value your time and prefer to work with professional salesmen, due yourself a favor and find another dealership in Houston.",1.4
6,"October 27, 2008","I went in to trade my Audi for a newer version hoping to have a smooth transition. All went well up until the time I signed on the dotted line. Once I did this it was like I no longer existed. Mike would screen his phone calls and no longer return my calls. Then his manager would call me saying they hadn't heard from me to see what was going on with my car (we had a tire situation) as like he hadn't heard from me in weeks. I told him that I practically called Mike every other day to get the matter resolved with zero help from him.  The funny thing was that if you called Mike from different phone numbers he would always pick up. I think I eventually called him from about 4 different numbers. Anyway, Herb was arrogant and rude - he talks over you when you try and talk and obviously has never heard the motto ""the customer is always right"". If you can buy a car from another dealer, I would.  Don't bother coming here unless you like to get the run around from sales associates AND their managers. Terrible service!",2.0
