1,"February 06, 2020","If you want to buy a car that last more than TWO years ,  DONT buy one from the Roger Beasley Mazda Dealership !!!! You have been WARNED!!I bought a vehicle from the company in late 2017.  I needed to get it service for some work since my engine light came only to find out that went back on the 5 year extended insurance plan that they promise me!!! I even had a contract for it. When I bought the vehicle the dealer (that there SUPPOSE to train)told me I had 5 years from 2017 for the warranty on my car. I told the Roger dealership that and even provided a CONTRACT for it. They told me that they will not honor it and it was five years from the in-service date that they LISTED on the contact. The company FAILED to put a In-service date on my contract, so me (listening to this “trained” dealer) took his word from saying that the warranty last 5 years from the day I purchase the car. Now a Customer who has never been late or missed a payment since I bought the car is now forced to find a different car. Please STAY AWAY from this company. They do not train people properly and lie just to get your money..I would give them zero stars if I could. I will also to post to other sites to warn other customers about their DECEITFUL behavior!!!!",1.0
2,"January 20, 2020","I recently had rodent damaged repaired by Roger Beasley Mazda. The repairs were excellent and the follow up to a few minor issues afterwards were remedied. 

My family has owned Mazdas for a long time and I’m glad to say that I will be carrying on the tradition.",5.0
3,"October 24, 2019","We bought a used 2018 cx3. Car has 30000+ miles. The car is off white color. Bought car for wife. I have driven it 2 times. We bought car on a sunny day. I was in the hanger and happened to notice the car has hail damage all over the roof and a few small dents on the hood. Dents are not noticeable in the sun unless viewed at a certain angle. We went back  to Beasley. Used car mgr met with us. Goes to look at car with several other people. Pics were taken. Another mgr comes in and told us it would be illegal to sell hail damage without disclosure. Car had a car fax and dealer inspection. Said the “master tech” that checked the no damage box was an expert. After saying this he accused us of trying to scam  the dealership. Point blank accused us of lying. Went home and looked for hailstorms in the area in the time span from car bought date and noticed damage date, none anywhere close to us. We have bought 5 vehicles from Beasley. I bought a rx7 in 1982 shortly after I got out of hospital for burn injuries incurred in a helicopter accident while in the Marines. Met Roger Beasley at that time. Nice short visit with him. I also have a rx 7 race car. In summary a teacher and retired disabled vet were called liars by management at Beasley. Yes, I should have looked harder at time of purchase.  I put to much faith in Beasley, carfax, and dealer inspection. Learned big lesson and will not go back or recommend beasley any more. Mike Krizan ",1.0

7,"February 24, 2018","It's been almost 2 months since we bought cars for my daughter and I. We worked with Shaun, JC and Brandon in Georgetown. I am so pleased with the top of the line customer service! I will be returning for my next vehicle. Thank You so much guys for the extra hard work! I'm sorry I let my link expire for the survey. Please make sure these guys get credit for the excellent service they provided to us! I've been telling everyone that I've talk to about my new car how awesome you guys are!!!! ",5.0
8,"July 03, 2017","Wally, the salesman, was so knowledgeable about the products and answered all my questions. He made feel comfortable and not like I was being ""sold"" a car. Brian and Taylor helped me in the financial and paperwork portions. This experience was worth my 45 minute drive. Roger Beasley earned my business and I'll very likely return next time I'm in the market. I'm happy with my beautiful new Mazda 6 in the driveway.",5.0
9,"June 07, 2017","I am very value conscious and say CX-5 Sport Automatic advertised for Under $20K. That was Saturday and made it to dealer on Monday.  All gone. However Jason and especially Brian explained extra safety features on the Touring model, and gave me a very good deal that I was comfortable with taking. We both understood neither had time to waste, and the negotiations went smoothly and quickly.  No pressure tactics.  But most pleasant of all was after the sale, there were a couple minor items that Brian took the appropriate actions to make me feel completely satisfied.  Would gladly recommend him to anyone interested in a new vehicle.

11,"February 24, 2017","I WOULD LIKE TO THANK DJ MOASSER AND ROGER BEASLEY MAZDA FOR THE BEST CAR BUYING EXPERIENCE I'VE EVER HAD. FROM THE MOMENT WE GOT THERE,DJ MOASSER WAS VERY FRIENDLY AND EXTREMELY HELPFUL IN ANSWERING ALL OUR QUESTIONS..",5.0
12,"October 26, 2016","There is nothing particularly amazing about this dealership.  At best, it is your typical cliche car dealership.  Right down to the fake Rolex's worn by shady sales associates.

Salesmen standing outside by the dozens like sharks and piranhas, waiting to pounce as soon as you open your car door.  The usual sales banter and gimmicks...""We like to treat our customers as family"", ""What do we have to do to earn your business?"", ""We promise to give you an HONEST, FAIR DEAL!""  The last one is the kicker, they even plaster it across their website.

I came to this dealership looking to purchase a certified pre-owned Mazda 6.  Test drove the vehicle and was impressed with the vehicle itself.  The salesman was decent enough.  Knowledgeable and polite.  Upon telling him that I was interested in the car, we go inside and he states that he is going to cut to the chase, go straight to the boss (the general sales manager) and get the ""price I want, so they can earn my business!""  The mannerisms and fake enthusiasm in the sales industry is borderline comical, however I played along.  After about 10 minutes of planning their surgical strike, the salesman and the GSM appear.  They offer a ""low as we can possibly go"" price of the vehicle.  I present them with a reasonable counter offer to which the say they can not entertain, so I proceed to leave.  

Mind you the difference between the two prices was roughly $1k dollars.  Thats right, $1k for a dealership that will boast that they sell in volume, not car by car.  A dealership that has several stores throughout Central Texas that sells hundred if not thousands of cars a month.  The ""largest network of Mazda dealerships in the country"" and they are letting a deal go over a thousand dollars!

Not two hours later I get a phone call from someone with the last name of Beasley thanking me for coming in and stating that they really wish they can earn my business.  Granted the phone call simply turned out to be a follow-up to my visit, which I can appreciate on the customer service side of the house.  

Over the next week, amazingly the rock bottom price that was initially offered to me, starts to decrease ever so slightly!  ""We are giving away the farm on this deal!!!""  Just one of the hilarious quotes I came across in my dealings with Roger Beasley.  

Weird...  I thought you initially told me that there was zero wiggle room for you as a dealership with this car, and now all of a sudden you can knock off a few hundred here and there?!  Typical, sleazy car sales tactics.  I was even told that to seal the deal, they would provide a full tank of gas and a complete detail of the vehicle upon delivery!!!  

What the.....???!!!  Wow, what a tremendous closing line!  Offer me something that is expected from every dealership throughout the country, on any and every car that is sold!  It was this promise of a car wash and tank of gas that solidified my thoughts of Roger Beasley Mazda.  Just absolutely comical.....

After a week, I send another internet inquiry about the vehicle using a made up name.  I wanted to see how honest and truthful Roger Beasley actually claimed to be.  Wouldn't you know, I get an immediate return email, offering the EXACT price that I offered for the vehicle one week earlier.  I couldn't believe it.....  I wrote the GSM as well as the General Manager to voice my disappointment in Roger Beasley Mazda, only to be told typical sales crap again.  According to the GSM, the dealership is ""incredibly close to hitting a end of the month sales mark"" and that they can magically now, ""take a hit on a car to secure their end of the month bonus"".  

Imagine my surprise on the incredibly convenient timing Roger Beasley Mazda fell into.  

I will say that Mazda makes a fantastic product and that their vehicles are not only fun to drive, but a pleasure to own.  I have owned three different Mazda's over the past 9 years and have been nothing but delighted.  

Save yourself the hassle and time waisting that you will certainly endure with Roger Beasley Mazda.  Find another dealership, like I did, that is gimmick and cliche free.  The only reason I gave this review more than one star, is that communication with Roger Beasley Mazda was never in question.  Everything else about the dealership and car sales experience unfortunately was.",2.3
13,"May 11, 2016","Justin Chavez was my primary contact. He was attentive and patient through the whole process. It took a lot of work to find what I finally ended up with, but all the staff were great and made me feel confident that I had made a good choice. I drove away a happy lady. ",5.0
14,"March 30, 2016","Went in to test drive the Mazda 6. Everybody at the dealership was great, but Justin Chavez was a standout. He was knowledgeable, kind and funny. Answered all of our questions and helped every step of the way. Needless to say we drove home with my new Mazda that night! Thank you for everything, Justin. I love my car.

15,"March 12, 2016","We went to test drive the new Mazda Miata MX-5 and drove home with the car in the next 2 days. All the folks at this dealership are amazing - we had an absolutely fantastic customer experience. Special call out to Justin - he was patient with all our queries, explained us the details of the car and helped us choose the right model and make the right choice. Highly recommend !",5.0
16,"March 01, 2016","I found a CX-9 online that I was interested in.  It was in the process of being delivered to Roger Beasley. I called and spoke with The General Sales Manager, James Gillespie, and asked him to hold the vehicle when it arrived, as I live 3 hours away from his dealership.  He was so kind to do so.  He even sent me the link to apply for financing so I would already have my final price and payments ready before I got to Georgetown.  Once I arrived at the dealership, I worked with the Assistant Manager, Terrence Moorer, who was wonderful.  Never lost his smile the whole time I was there.  Terrence set me up with Finance for paperwork (very quick process), arranged to have the new car detailed and handle the trade-in process very smoothly.  Once the car was ready, he took the time to walk me thru all the technical gadgets (setting up my phone, favorite radio stations, and programming addresses in the GPS) before I got on the road back home.  It was a pleasure to do business at Roger Beasley and I would recommend them to anyone in the Austin area.",5.0
17,"February 28, 2016",It felt like Terrence did everything  possible to give me a great and went above and beyond to make that happen. it truly was a pleasant experience and I will definitely go back to him and recommend him to others. Thanks Terrence I feel like I got a really great deal and couldn't be happier.,5.0
18,"February 27, 2016","This dealership is hands down the best in Central Texas. This is my second purchase here and once again the entire process was easy and low key. Terrence Moorer is a superb car salesman and just a really nice guy. Very quick to reply to a few texts I sent in the evening and super friendly and fair in dealing with the purchase. In house financing was quick and painless and a decent rate to boot. Richard Grimm from service was also super cool and worked with Terrence to set up an appointment on Monday to work on a quick easy maintenance issue. 

I recommend these guys not only for their great prices, but their professionalism and friendliness as well. Check em out when you're ready to buy a Mazda.",5.0
19,"January 29, 2016","Great buying experience with salesman Justin Chavez at Roger Beasley Mazda of Georgetown!

I checked on availability of a late model Mazda CX-5 on the Internet, and as requested, received an email informing me that it was available.  Jake Hallahan is who contacted me and he gave me full details regarding the Mazda Certified vehicle; and who put me in contact with Justin.

Justin was informative both during a phone call, and via several text messages between us.  Vehicle was as described, and he throughly covered its features without being a pushy salesman.

I've recommended him to others, and will contact him again if in the market for another Mazda!",4.8
20,"December 30, 2015","I went in to trade a Ford Focus for a Mazda3. My sales rep, Justin Chavez, was awesome! He was knowledgeable about the car and all the features, helped me find the right car, and was super cool while waiting for the paper work to get started. If you want to buy a Mazda, go in and ask for Justin!",5.0
21,"December 19, 2015","Bob Amazeen at Roger Beasley Georgetown Mazda was knowledgable, helpful and pleasant.  He throughly explained all the safety features and answered our detailed questions.  The entire staff and service department were helpful in the purchase of our new car. ",4.8
22,"December 03, 2015","Justin Chavez is an awesome salesman, but more than that, he is someone who listens to your concerns and questions and has all the answers you need to make an informed decision on your new car.  He feels more like family when he sits with you and helps you decide what you want to do. 

I would go to Roger Beasley again and again and recommend them to anyone looking for a great car and the perfect team to get you in it. This is our second Mazda and we love it. Nothing handles like this car. We leased the CX-5 and it's perfect for us. 

He's awesome. I didn't just shake his hand, I hugged him before we left.  That says it all.  ",5.0
23,"November 17, 2015","Best car buying experience I have encountered. No pressure, no hassle, just pleasant and attentive. Would recommend Justin to anyone interested in purchasing a vehicle at Roger Beasley Mazda...great dealership! Everyone I worked with at that dealership was awesome! ",5.0
24,"October 31, 2015","I don't typically write reviews unless the experience is exemplary and beyond expectations (or the reverse).  Roger Beasley Mazda Georgetown exceeded our expectations, and made the experience of buying a new car a dream!  

From the time we arrived at the dealership and were greeted by Justin Chavez, to the completion of signing the contract, it was all excellent.  Justin was friendly, professional and knowledgeable and it was more like being helped by an old friend; he made us feel at ease, and he was entirely patient as he answered our questions about the Mazda 6 as a possible candidate for a new car.  My husband is not easily swayed, but with Justin's professionalism and likeable manner, not only did we test drive the Mazda 6 Grand Touring, we purchased the car!  

We are more than satisfied and happy with our experience at Roger Beasley, with all the staff we interacted with, especially Justin, and will not hesitate to recommend Roger Beasley Mazda Georgetown to friends and family (even complete strangers!))  And, we look forward to driving our new Mazda 6 Grand Touring car!  

Thank you!

25,"October 31, 2015","Out of all dealerships me and my Fiancee visited (audi, volkswagon, honda, bmw) Mazda of Georgetown was the only one not pulling any bait and switch tricks. They were straight forward about the line up and didnt push the sale but rather inform us about the vehicle in a very matter of fact way. We purchased the Mazda 3 S GT, it sold itself, the way any car should, there was no need to be pushed into it.  What did surprise me was how professional the staff was, I like most people always had  a rather negative view of car salesmen because afterall they are there to make money and the buyer is the one thats going to be providing it, however the entire staff showed so much patience, understanding, and fairness that i could not be happier about what i bought, who i bought it from, how much i bought it for and therefore the entire buying experience.  I highly commend Mazda and Roger Beasley Mazda for putting together such an amazing car with the perfect team to deliver it.  I highly reccomend this dealership and our dealer Justin Chavez was amazingly patient, it felt like he was working with us, he sought out what we wanted, made the moves, really hustled for us and we really appreciated it, if he were a real estate agent we'd hire him to help us find a house too.",5.0
26,"September 25, 2015",For my first car I was not sure what dealer ship to go  I saw the reviews on roger Beasley in Georgetown. I  went and justin Chavez took care of me with great  customer service explaining every detail word by word and helping me Out getting  a new car. Thank you Justin Chavez I love my new Mazda 3 ,5.0
27,"August 30, 2015","Salesmen did a great job having vehicles we were interested in ready for a test drive when we arrived at the dealership.  They answered all our questions.  Best of all, we felt absolutely NO pressure whatsoever,   This was a very nice surprise.   It was the main reason we returned and bought a car a few days later.",5.0
28,"August 27, 2015","The sales process is amazing! I came to the dealership, drove the car I was interested in, received a fair deal on the car and my trade in, and I didn't have to spend all day at the dealership!!",5.0
29,"February 05, 2013","Though the employees there were friendly, the knowledge of expertise is questionable.  I paid for work that I was led to believe that my problem was fixed even after I questioned the diagnosis.  After paying $550 the problem was not fixed.  I was told after bringing the truck back and them keeping it overnight, that the noise I was hearing was normal gear sounds.  It left me wondering if the work that was done need to be done?  ",2.4
30,"September 17, 2010",Was met at the dealership by Sylvia.  She was very friendly and helpful answering questions while I was there.  I test drove a Mazda 6 due to a promotion and wanted to look at a used vehicle they had listed on their website as well.  Even though I didn't purchase a vehicle the experience was a pleasure.  I would not have a problem coming back to this dealership considering the experience without purchasing anything.,4.6
