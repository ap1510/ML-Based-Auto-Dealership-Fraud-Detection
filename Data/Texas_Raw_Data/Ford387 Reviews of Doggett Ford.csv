0,"May 22, 2020","I purchased a 2019 F350.  My phone would not quit ringing before I purchased, but now they will not call me  back.  I have left 2 messages to the finance manager with no response.  I have called the main dealership number with no luck.  I have texted my salesman with the same results.  Please don't buy from these people.  ZERO customer support!  Sorry Sorry customer support.  I will never by from them again.",1.8
1,"March 18, 2020","My regular dealership was Lone Star Ford, who was FANTASTIC! When Doggett bought out Lone Star they became ""my dealership"". The service was terrible ... they did an oil change and fixed a recall. My vehicle was totally messed up afterwards. When I called them, they were excessively rude and couldn't care less. They wanted to charge me to diagnose something they messed up! Seemed like a scam to me, and the typical ""take advantage of the female"". Don't waste your time with this unethical service department!",1.0
2,"December 06, 2019","Save yourself the trouble and do not buy pre owned vehicles from this dealership! It hasn’t even been a full month since I bought a vehicle from this dealer and I have already had to have had this vehicle towed to a shop and worked on. It has been to the shop on two separate occasions now both for completely different reasons. Take your business elsewhere, take your business where customer satisfaction, and dependability is guaranteed, I can tell you right now this is not the dealership that offers that.

I’ll be close to $3,000 dollars in repairs on the vehicle I purchased from the dealer. The dealer has yet to respond to any of my inquiries, every time I have called to speak with some one at the dealer the line gets “disconnected”. Please folks I can’t stress enough do not give these people your hard earned money period. Their goal is not to sell you a reliable vehicle but to sell you anything they can make a profit off of. Do not support this dealership or they will continue their malpractices on anyone that comes their way.",1.0
3,"August 30, 2019","Carl Chuddy quoted me a price initially (after informing him I had fleet code) that was higher than what was listed online, but quite a bit.  This was a cash deal and should have been a quick easy transaction.  We were told by one person at the dealership the vehicle had a few miles, and another that is has less than 100 miles.  I arranged the transaction over email and phone and expected the vehicle to be ready when I got there.  I was required to put a $500 hold on a credit card on a Thursday, and was scheduled to come in on Monday or Tuesday to pick it up.  Later found out they took my card information but it was never processed.  I arrived, was not even offered to be shown the vehicle.  I was taken inside asked for the check and insurance card.  He brought back a form for me to fill out.  Then took me into the finance office.  That transaction with what I thought was smooth.  Came out to find the salesman talking with another salesman who was looking to leave that dealership to go to another.  Carl told him that the sales manager was friends with the sales manager over there so it would probably get back pretty quick.  And while the other dealership may pay more, they probably require more of their salespeople than what they are required at Doggett.  They continued chatting it up right in front of us.  Very unprofessional.  Finally they broke it up.  He asked if I wanted the vehicle washed.  I asked how long it would take, he said at least 45 minute as there were 4 vehicles in front of ours.  I told him not to worry about it, just bring it around.  He left, we went outside and waited just over 30 minutes until he finally pulled it around.  It was cleaned on the outside, but not necessarily on the inside.  Took a look at the odometer at this point, while he was putting the license plate on.  Mileage was actually nearing 500 miles.  I pointed this out and he said it didn't matter for their purposes, and asked if I wanted him to change the paperwork.  I said well doesn't the warranty begin at the mileage at purchase.  He said yes and just shrugged his shoulders.  Never at that point offered to go in and fix it.  Proceeded to mention that Ford would be sending us a review and ""for his family"" would I leave a good one.  I was never introduced to manager, service department, etc. 

What should have been a quick easy transaction, a straight cash deal.  While he may not have made a huge profit on this one due to fleet pricing, there is still a level of professionalism that should be maintained.  I left with the impression that Doggett could care less about their customers.  We will not purchase any other vehicles from them.",1.6
4,"August 20, 2019","Ok I’m gonna start by saying I know I bought the car as is but for this car to break down on me 2 weeks later and for them to tell I bought a warranty for a reason, it’s wrong. Where is the customer service aspect of this issue? I mean for a car to break down because you glued parts together it’s ok because I bought it as is? This is your fault not mine and it’s ridiculous I have to spend $250 on a Deductible to fix a car I haven’t even received my plates on. Worst dealer I’ve ever bought from and I would NOT recommend this place or the salesman Josh Ross. He’ll make you feel like he cares but then doesn’t answer the phone or doesn’t call you back. Go to any other dealer besides this one because money is more important than caring and doing their jobs. ",1.0
5,"June 17, 2019",Craig was so patient with me & never made me feel like he was just trying to get me to buy something. He made me feel like what I got out of the deal was the most important. He never lost his patience & made sure I had EVERYTHING I needed. I can't wait until someone I know needs a car so I can send them directly to Craig. This guy did an A+ job. A+ customer service. I will buy from Craig again. ,5.0

9,"April 10, 2019","Jack our Sales Lady was extremely organized friendly and knew her stuff. She is a pro. Jason Mosely was also Johnny on the spot withocating 2 Raptors for me and making it happen very painlessly. 
Unfortunately her Sales boss Victor thought it would be necessary to text her while she was doing our new product demos. When I say demos I mean I bought 2 Ford Raptors and for some reason that wasn’t enough to keep her boss from pinging her for the entire time of our demo. She finally had to obey and she never came back. Her sales boss Victor did but it was obvious he couldn’t have cared less. 
We also encountered a bad experience with the service department. One of the Raptors has a bad speaker. When we called to setup a service appointment the advisor didn’t think to try and trouble shoot or figure out what the issue was with the vehicle. So when we dropped off the vehicle the service advisor called us back to tell us that they didn’t not have the part and it would be around 2 weeks to get the part. So we came back to pickup our Raptor and the service department could not locate our truck keys. We understand the dealership is new and it will be successful due to the owner Leslie Doggett’s reputation. ",4.0

20,"April 01, 2019",It has been a pleasure working with the fleet department at Doggett. My experience working with other dealers has been marginal at best. Doggett was very helpful in making sure I got the most out of what I needed for my fleet. Will order my next fleet purchase from Doggett. ,5.0
21,"March 31, 2019","I found the Ram 2500 I liked through USAA’s service and contacted Doggett through the USAA program. Jackie responded quickly and was easy to work with, both in setting up the test drive and the following day to arrange pick up. I am going to dock one star as I was told by Fernando that there were two keys for the truck (the key tag was marked two), but when picking up the truck there was only one. It’s a minor issue, granted, but since it’s a push button start it’s going to cost around $300 for a new key with programming. ",4.8

Jackie was beyond friendly and while my family completed the remaining portion of paperwork, she made sure that she showed me all the ins and outs of the vehicle and spent a little bit of time to get to know me.

I’ve called many times in the past few years and talked to a lot of people about getting it fixed. I still get emails about this stranger’s car. You are violating data privacy laws by continuing to keep and use my email address after I have asked many times to delete it. Even if I opt out of emails, I still get service reminders and requests for reviews.

46,"March 05, 2019","The price on the vehicle was great. At the time of sale I was happy with how everything went. However, 30 minutes after driving off the lot my battery died. The wrong size battery was in my truck and the corrosion on it was beyond belief. I am not sure how a dealership can sell a vehicle on their lot that has that bad of corrosion. The dealership said it would refund me the money that it cost to get the right size battery, which I was grateful for. However, that took 2 weeks from the time the incident happened. I left numerous voicemails and I would not get timely response or I would get some beat around the bush answer. I would not reccomend this dealership to anyone because of my experience.",2.0

49,"February 28, 2019","Kevin and Alex did a fantastic job helping me through the purchase process of my new Ford Ranger. They answered all of my questions, Alex explained features excellently during the test drive, and I got exactly what I wanted at a fair price. Plus, Alex drove to Galveston to pick up the Ranger in order to install a spray-in bedliner, even after I offered to drive back to the dealership. Finally, a gentleman in the finance department (unfortunately I forget his name) got me a loan through my bank (Wells Fargo) at a very competitive interest rate. I was outta there driving “Hank” in just a little over three hours, and it definitely didn’t feel to take forever. ",5.0

60,"February 14, 2019","Took my vehicle in to have a recall performed on the AC unit.  When the vehicle was returned to us, the start button was cracked and the center console sliding storage lid was not sliding.  Took it back to have those issues fixed and then the light didn't work in the sliding storage after it was returned to us.  They had to come and get the vehicle because the previous tech did not plug in the light.  The quality of their service technicians work makes me question any and all work performed.  Only reason I am giving two stars is because the service writer actually tried to help in any way he can.  I would drive out of my way before ever taking a car for service here again.

A car dealership that wasn't out to get every dime you have and leave you buried . There was not a single bs fee . Not one !!!!   So here it is in plain English :
I feel like I got a fair deal , they made money, I saved some money , Kevin listened to what I said and got what I asked for without wasting time or grinding me .There was no back and forth I got a fair deal on the first try ..Until today I would not believed it possible . I recommended Doggett Ford to my credit union. . I can not remember one dealer I would consider recommending to anyone EVER . But I did today . Kevin did not try to sell me anything he helped me buy the truck I wanted .  I was not offered or promised anything for this review. You can buy a car and not get hammered into submission.

When I returned to the dealership, he totally ignored me.  I assume his rudeness was because I wondered why Doggett didn't stay in Lone Star's location.  Little did I know at the time that Doggett has plans to build a new facility.  Anyhow, Mark Wheeler became extremely rude when I questioned why Doggett  changed locations.  When I returned to pick up my car he didn't even acknowledge my existence.  I had planned to have all my maintenance don by Doggett.  I had even planned to buy new tires at Doggett.  But now I will have my service elsewhere even though Tommy Vaughn and Planet Ford are farther away.  I will also buy my new tires else elsewhere.  Cochise at Lone Star Ford was excellent.  He was always extremely courteous and respectful.  When I checked in he would check the tires, windhield wiper and other things to make sure they were in good working order.

Three sales people, one receptionist and me.  No hustle and bustle. No one approached me.

343,"April 26, 2017","The sunroof track on my 2015 F 150 broke unexpectedly preventing it's function. Warranty covered the repairs. I left the truck at the dealership and the service manager Mark Wheeler was great. He gave me a ride home since Enterprise was already closed. Unfortunately my experience after that was not so good. The rental Enterprise put me in was filthy. It was a Ford Focus. Stained seats, dusty inside, foggy speedometer gauges, smudges all over the glass, and a wet dog smell. The car seemed like it had been in a flood. Even though I drive a loaded full size truck this was what I was offered. I was stuck driving this for a week. My schedule prevented me from returning the car. I drive a nice truck for a reason. There are times I need to meet with vendors and we travel together for business. This vehicle prevented me from doing anything related to that. The service department was not much better. I did not get any type of follow up call from them. I called several times and left messages that did not get responses. When I did speak to someone they would provide a quick update such as ""parts are on order' but not provide a definite completion date. I finally got the truck back a week later. It was raining heavily that day so I did not get to test out the roof much. Upon further inspection after leaving the dealership I noticed they failed to reinstall my sunroof windscreen that came with the truck. When I called back they explained that the tech had to break it to remove it. What?! Were they going to disclose this had I not figured it out?They told me they would order the part and let me know when it arrived. It has been more than a week and no calls. On top of everything I have to take more time away from work to return the truck since the sunroof ""repair"" has to be completed. Now my sunroof creaks and pops when I am driving. Also the sunshade struggles to close as if it is misaligned. This is unacceptable! I am approaching my 36,000 miles and the factory B2B warranty will run out. I do not have time to be without a truck for another week. I am forced to return to them to complete the job. Lets hope it gets done right this time. ",1.6

346,"December 13, 2016","The salesguy I dealt with Kendel was courteous, responsive, and helpful during the sale process.  I did make it pretty easy for them in regards to the buying process (bought car from out of town) by having pre-approval and drafting sent to them.  Kendel did line up all the paperwork and picked me up in the car from the Vonlane drop off point which was great.  Then things went downhill from there.  The description of the car was not accurate (said the car was in like  new condition  ***i.e. no scratches or dings, tires in great condition, etc etc).  

First off, the front end had quite a few rock chips and scratches (car is a 2016 White Mustang GT with 17k miles on it) in which it looked like it had been backed into.  I had them put on the We Owe that those issues would be fixed (along with them offering a $100 gift card for me having to now travel back down there at some point for them to fix that I still have yet to receive almost a month later).  Due to work and timing I had to take delivery of the car at night which, I do claim fault of not being able to thoroughly inspect like I should have.  

Upon bringing the car home I found numerous things that has made me lose faith in the dealership and how they look over cars.  The simple things that every other dealership I have bought from had performed such as oil change, air and cabin filter change, wipers replaced, wiping down the interior, and setting the vehicle to default settings had all not been performed.  

These are simple, easy, and cheap things that most all dealerships do when they take possession of a vehicle and turn it around for re-sale.  I was taking Kendel's word on the condition of the car, and he was accurate for a lot of it (interior immaculate, albeit dirty, rear tires in like new and stated same for front, but in reality they were 60% worn based on tread depth indicator, chip in windshield, scratches in front of car).  Kendel has been helpful, but his power to delivery seems to be limited by management unwillingness to allow for proper follow through.  

I'm not sure if it is laziness, cost cutting, or plain not caring, but it's disconcerting enough for me to recommend check all the simple things prior to buying a car here as they do not look over a vehicle like is posted all over their website that they do.  Only reason I bought here was due to the pricing being lower than everyone else for the same car.  If all else being equal, I would recommend checking out another dealer's car first as you might stand a better chance of it being looked over properly prior to it being put back on the lot.  I would not recommend buying a vehicle from here as they will be the stereotypical dealership and tend to your needs during the sales process, but once you sign the paperwork they stop trying to work for you.  AutoNation Chevrolet in Austin and Alamo San Antonio, Mak Haik Ford in Georgetown are all the last 3 dealerships I've had dealings with and every single one of those dealerships came through in a timely manner (and many times have gone above and beyond) during pre-during-post parts of the sales process.  I had high hopes for this transaction, but have been sorely let down.  Take my experience for what it's worth and do the checks like I recommended prior to taking delivery.

A person named Steve as since replied on reviews (via Google and Yelp) saying they want to make things right and have yet to receive contact or resolution.  I assume this is just to give the perception ploy though.  

***Edit (3 weeks after dealer response): So as suspected it was a hollow response and no one has reached out.  I even reached out to George Castillo who is the used car manager and still nothing.  That being said I dropped down the rating from 2-star to one because of this.  It really takes about the same amount of time to respond to an online review as it does to pick up the phone.  Hopefully this helps prevent someone else avoid the same experience.***",1.6

I toke my EL to Lone Star Ford because Tommie Vaugh said they were booked up for two weeks in service. Lone Star said they could fix my problem in two days. I called four days later and Andy (service guy) said they forgot about repairing the EL. Four days more and a $900.00 bill they said it was ready. Nothing covered under warranty. I balked at the bill because they Quoted $791.37 on the phone. They said they added a diagnostic fee without my approval so they removed the bogus charge. Bad experience, but I had to go out of town. On my trip the front end shook very badly, they created this problem because the front end never shook before. I went to an independent shop, they balanced the tires. Lone Star charged me for balancing but didn’t do the balance job. Now the EL drives just fine. Fast forward three months and 5,000 miles and my front left tire is worn on the inside again. I called Lone Star on the phone and told this story I am writing and the service manager said Lone Star will not warranty the El because I probably hit a curb, and I had the independent shop re-do the balancing.

Every person I dealt with and every person I saw was more than helpful, professional and exhibited an air of ""enjoying"" being there and wanting to help. Mr. Howard knew what I wanted 
respected my time by not showing me other vehcles and let me make my selection.. This will probably the last car in my life that I purchase and I could not have chosen a better place..",5.0
372,"August 06, 2015","The sales process with my salesman was as smooth as my last few experiences purchasing cars at other dealers. Michael found the truck I was looking for, explained the features of the truck and was very upfront about everything. I didn't feel like he was just trying to make a sale and was doing everything to ensure I was getting the best deal.

The paper work process could have been much faster, as I was there from 9am until 1pm but it is what it is. 

My ONLY complaint was that when I did drive off with the truck, I found out on my drive home that the truck alignment appear to be off as the truck would pull to the right and later found out that the tire PSI were really under inflated . Truck recommended psi was 42, tire psi showed 32. Was my mistake for assuming tires were of the right psi before driving off but the alignment? Come on man, this is a new truck!

Called Michael and he said to bring the truck in for service to look at the alignment.

Great dealership and sales team but I recommend checking everything before driving off. ",3.8

374,"August 29, 2014","I bought a 2013 Explorer at Lone Star and was treated very fair with the front desk which was refreshing, it was not until I went to finance that my problem started. You see I let him talk me into the extended warranty where he told me that everything would be covered bumper to bumper for up to 100,000 miles and related months which I wanted due to the electronics. To cut this down in time I put 35,000 miles on the car in almost two years which in Houston is easy to do, I had Lone Star do all of the maintenance so no questions would come up if I ever needed to use the warranty. Well just last month I took it in for my oil change and asked the man in service about a check engine light I had come on a few days before, I had pulled the code and found it to be a $14.00 part and really no big deal but wanted to know what I need to do to get it fixed. He told me no problem and took the car to get the oil changed. In the meantime I was seriously looking to buy a Ford Dually and was looking on the lot and had two picked out that I was waiting for a salesman to come in to talk about with him since it was 7AM in the morning. After 1 1/2 hours the service writer came up to me and told me to get the check engine light issue fixed it would cost $200.00 for the part due to insurance deductible and $125.00 for labor plus taxes. Back to the finance guy, he never brought up a deductible when he was pushing on the up sale and I have to pay for labor also? I also found out that my 1 1/2 hour wait was just for them to give me a price for all of this and my oil was never changed so I ask him to get my oil changed and forget about all the time he put into writing me a quote when all I asked was if it was covered. Five minutes later the service manager came back in with him and asked me why I did not want to get the issue fixed and I told him I came in to get the oil changed and was inquiring if warranty would cover the issue that I told the service writer about (remember I told the writer what the problem was). The Manager at this time told me I owed them over a $100 for troubleshooting the issue and became aggressive about it. I demanded that they bring the Explorer around and that was going to be the end of it since they did not change the oil and I did not ask to have the Explorer to be put in for repairs other than an inquiry. After all of this and a heated debate with the Service Manager standing toe to toe with me I left and stopped by Chevrolet and as of today all I can say is that I love my new loaded LTZ Chevrolet 3500 Diesel Dually.

Thank You Lone Star Ford!
By the way, I have it in writing that I pay nothing for my Bumper To Bumper services.",2.2
375,"March 07, 2013","I took my car to Lone Star on 01/12/13 because I needed to get my brakes repaired.  Mr. Willis told me that my brakes were not that bad, but I needed some tires.  I bought some tires and left Lone Star Ford and my brakes were still grinding.  I ended up taking my vehicle to another shop to get my brakes repaired.  So, in the future, I will not buy any tires from Lone Star Ford because they were very overpriced and I will not get my brakes repaired at Lone Star Ford because the brake shop that repaired my tires was a lot less expensive than what Lone Star Ford would have charged me.  I purchased my vehicle from Lone Star Ford in 2010 and my intentions was to let Lone Star Ford do all of the needed work on my vehicle so that when I decided to trade my vehicle in for another one, I would have a complete listing showing that Lone Star Ford did all of the repair work.  But since I had such a disappointing experience with Lone Star Ford, I have decided that I will start taking my vehicle so another company to let them do the work on the vehicle on an as needed basis.  

Thank you.",1.8

377,"February 09, 2013","Robert R, was the only reason I drove all the way to Loan Star Ford. I had a down payment on another truck at another dealership. After talking to Robert online and on the phone I drove out. He wanted to make a sale and was very helpful. The truck I looked at was the same truck as Auto Nation that I put a deposit on. Robert was the difference, very nice person and did everything to make us happy and satisfied. I would refer my friends to this salesman, we are very happy and didn't walk away feeling bad about anything.",5.0
378,"February 08, 2013","It was a great experience at Loan Star Ford. I called in from out of state, hoping to get a vehicle lined up before I move down to Houston.  Without meeting me in person, Tarik showed trust in me, and went out his way to have the exact vehicle I wanted in the dealership, waiting for me when I arrived at Houston.  The whole crew at Loan Star Ford were very friendly and helpful. We were very satisfied with our purchase there.",5.0

385,"January 13, 2013","A gentleman personally offered everyone individually a bottle of water while waiting in the waiting room. The lady in the cashier's office could not find a record of my purchase at Lone Star Ford or the service transaction history of the vehicle with Lone Star. The lost records was no surprise because the paperwork is always lost or misplaced or rarely supplied when checking out. However, the cashier reactivated my Loyal Customer account and charged the reduced price for the oil change as negotiated at time of purchase. I did lose the credit that was on my account. I will now have to provide copies of the credit to the cashier in hopes of having the credit reinstated on my next visit.",4.4
386,"December 19, 2011","Researched on line for several months, and found the vehicle I was looking for and a clear price on Lone Star Ford's website.  Met with Luis Pastor and showed him the numbers I had researched.  He was able to minimize the back and forth with the sales manager, so this was really a pleasant experience.  Fair price for my trade, and great price on the new Ford!  Then finance was painless, and I had the pleasure to meet Emma Jones.  She was the customer care/delivery specialist and did a fantastic job explaining the vehicle and making sure I was completely satisfied with my experience at Lone Star.  
Trade was paid off quickly, and tags/title were done in a week.  Went back to pick up tags and was warmly greeted by Luis and Emma.  This is a dealership that wants your business and makes you feel it!  Every concern is made to make sure the customer is happy and will recommend Lone Star to friends/family. ",5.0
