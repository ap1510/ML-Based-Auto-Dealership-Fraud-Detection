Isreal and the Cardenas team and along with Reba McNair,, sergio and Efrain had me driving out of the dealership in a new loaded vehicle .  

I have to thank  Isreal Rodriquez and his team for everything they did..    Service dept is amazing . I always say going to cardenas Harlingen is like getting  together with family.    With Andy Lara and Steve the service guys , your always in good hands.. I promise.

3,"February 14, 2017",Cardenas metroplex service department did a great job on our vehicle.  They picked it up from her place of work and left a loaner.  Service was complete the following day they returned her car washed and vaccumed.  They did a great job!,5.0
4,"November 18, 2005","I've bought to cars from them and dealt with pretty much everyone there during the past 2 years.  Two different sale reps, service, parts and even the body-shop (my first MB was rear-ended).

I must say that the overall experiences with them has been from good to outstanding.   The prices for parts and labor are consisted with those documented by Mercedes-Benz (not cheap).",4.6
