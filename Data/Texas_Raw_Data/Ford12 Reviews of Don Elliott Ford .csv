1,"February 04, 2018","I was at a Houston dealership when an friend called me. My friend told me to see Don Elliot. I went to East Bernard. I was treated as an long lost friend even though I never meet them. I was handed the keys and told to take the truck for an test ride by myself. I loved the ride . I told them what I wanted, they found and delivered exactly what I was looking for. Plus, the financing was painless. I am a customer for life. Thank you guys  ( Gary and Brandon )",5.0
2,"September 22, 2016",This place was amazing! We found we had a flat as we were getting ready to leave hotel for home. We went to their fast service lane when they opened and they had us fixed and back on the road in no time. All of the staff was very friendly and caring. A place where they really know what customer service is all about!,5.0
3,"January 03, 2016","I went in looking for two dependable new or used vehicles to replace my two old clunkers.  I was in a bad spot and, like most everyone, had a budget that I had to fall within regarding price.  I even thought I was going in, possibly looking for too much.  Gary and Brandon were receptive to my needs, and ""shot straight from the hip"".  We worked out a deal that provided me with my needs within the budget I specified.  They also gave me what I would consider a very gracious trade-in value for my two old vehicles.  ",5.0
4,"December 08, 2015",Bought a new vehicle. It had dents in tail gate that they tried to fix. Found others they covered with stickers. I was told I would get a new tailgate. 3 months later nothin. Worse dealership and they lie to you,2.4
5,"September 23, 2015","Don Elliott in East Bernard is the best place to get a new or used car.  The sales staff are the best. They work with you  finding the car or truck u want. We bought a truck, a car and a SUV from them and we r 100% satisfied. Everyone needs to buy their car from them. We will never go anywhere else!!!!",5.0
6,"June 01, 2015","I gave the high rating because both Brandon Krushall and Gary Krushall were a pleasure to work with. 
Brandon was very accommodating to meeting all of our requests.",4.8
7,"September 16, 2013","The sales staff was second to none. They made me feel very comfortable. It was almost like dealing with family. They did everything to accommodate my needs and did not pressure me to buy until I knew exactly what I wanted. I visited the dealership 5 to 6 times in a 3 week period trying to make up my mind on the type of truck I wanted, and once the decision was made they found exactly what I wanted  and had it to me the following day.

8,"January 30, 2013",Called Brandon and told him what I was looking for..he located the truck..gave me a price that beat everyone else. Truck arrived shortly thereafter..just as promised. Dealt with Gary on the financing and truck accessories. This was the easiest truck purchase that I've ever made. I recommend this dealership over all the rest!,5.0
9,"July 02, 2012",Great dealership Gary and Brandon where great people to work with. Everything was very simple and easy. I emailed ahead about the vehicle I wanted and made and appointment. When I got there they had it ready for me to test drive. After that we quickly filled out the papers and the car was mine very simple no games.,5.0
10,"July 01, 2011",Great experience!  I called inquiring about the vehicle I was interested in & scheduled an appointment that evening.  They were more than happy to stay after closing to accomodate us & began the financing process - we were there maybe an hour.  The next morning I was called with all the financing information as promised & picked up my vehicle that evening after work. They really went above & beyond to make it all happen so smoothly & we will definately buy from them from here on out.,4.6
11,"December 22, 2010","We drove over 100 miles to purchase a car. We met with Gary and Brandon. We checked the auto check and it said that the car was looked at by a mechanic on a 100 point inspection. 

We drove all the way out there to find out that the pictures can be deceiving. There was a dent in the wheel well and 2 deep scratches in the bumper. There were chips along the side and the tint on the windows was peeling. Online the pictures were at angles where you couldn't see this and it said it had EXCELLENT exterior and EXCELLENT interior. All of this was disappointing, but we still wanted to buy. When we talked to Brandon about it- he came back with 'weren't there pictures online?' He didn't seem all that apologetic. They knocked off $50 because of the tint... We test drove the car and were happy with how it drove. 

We had called the dealer in the morning and asked if we could pay with our debit card and they said YES! So we did not bring the cash with us. We were buying the car outright- no financing. Once we were ready to purchase- they told us that we needed the cash because the debit card companies charge them a fee. Well of course there was no wells fargo in this town- so we had to drive 25 minutes to the nearest one!?!

Then after hours of figuring things out, we were finally ready to get back on the road when we realize the AM radio works but the FM radio does not. The service department looked everything over but couldn't figure it out so they sent us on our way and said- take it to a Ford Dealer in your hometown and we'll pay for it. Well the dealer finds out that the whole radio needs to be replaced and Brandon says he can only pay for half of that. Then we find out that the windshield wiper fluid dispenser does not work and the windshield wipers themselves needed to be replaced.

Then we start hearing a noise when the radio is off. We take it in to a mechanic and they tell us: 
1. The engine needed a tune up.
2. The ignition coil needed to be replaced.
3. One hub bearing was bad and needed to be replaced ASAP.
4. The brake pads were shot and needed new ones.
5. The rotors were turned too thin and needed to be replaced.

According to Don Elliot Ford- their mechanic looked everything over- the guy we took it to said that there is NO WAY Don Elliot's mechanic did not see all of this. Brandon said they'd pay for the hub bearing but because it was not major mechanical problems- they would not cover the rest.

All in all, it was a very disappointing experience. We were first time used car buyers- we should have checked the windshield wipers and the radio before purchasing the car- but the rest should have been fixed before they tried to sell the car.

STAY AWAY FROM THIS LOCATION UNLESS YOU ARE BUYING A NEW CAR!!! If you are wondering why their cars are so cheap- there's a reason... they didn't do the work to make the car perfect.
