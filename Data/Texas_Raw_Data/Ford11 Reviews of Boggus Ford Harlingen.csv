1,"May 01, 2019","In December 2018, I began searching for a car for my 18 year-old son. I saved up $10,000 to buy a used car. I didn't want to go to those roadside car lots because I was afraid of being scammed. I have never been a fan of Ford but I thought I would give them a chance. The salesman showed me a 2014 Focus. The price including TT&L was $10,000. I thought maybe it was meant to be. It was later in the evening when I purchased the car. After getting it home, I noticed it had 4 bald tires. That was clue #1. I took it back and they did replace the tires, no charge. Flash forward 4 months and about 700 driving miles, my son takes the car for an oil change to an outside business. The air filter was dirty and had to be replaced. No big deal, but that was clue #2 that the car had not even had routine maintenance before it was put on the lot for resale. A couple days later, I took a ride with my son and noticed the car was lurching pretty badly when it was shifting. My son is young & doesn't know much about cars, and I am a woman who admittedly doesn't know much about them either. But I knew something was definitely wrong with that lurch. I took the car in and was told the clutch was bad, and since the car was no longer under warranty, would cost $1,400 to repair. Only 4 months after purchase, are you kidding me?! At that time I did what I should have done in the 1st place, and searched the net for problems with 2014 Focus. I was inundated with page after page of complaints about the clutch and transmission on that model. I brought that up to the people at Boggus and they told me the car had no problems with the previous owner. I verbalized my frustration with Boggus and told them I could not afford to be forking out $1,400 periodically for a faulty, mechanically flawed car. I asked to sell it back to them. They happily agreed to sell it back to me for about $3,000, 1/3 of what I paid for it 4 months earlier, because after all, now the car needs repair and is worth $1,400 less. Or they offered to put me in another car that they could set up reasonable payments for. REALLY??!! I paid cash for the car because I didn't want payments. Next they said they might be willing to pay half of the repair cost. Seriously??!! I called the Ford corporate office to complain and was told they were not going to do anything more to make the situation right. Next I received a call from Boggus telling me they had good news!!! The part that had been replaced with the previous owner was still under warranty as long as the car was repaired by the same people who worked on the car before. Neither they nor I would have to foot the bill for the repair. Now the story before was that the car had no problems or repairs with the previous owner. All of a sudden they disclose that the car did in fact have issues before. They called me that the car was repaired and back at the dealership. I decided I didn't want to keep an unreliable money pit of a car and told them I wanted to sell it back. $5,000 is what the manager offered, half what I paid for it 4 months earlier. The salesman said he could get me into a new Fiesta for $17,000 with low payments. How nice of him. You can't make this stuff up. Long story short, I got scammed. Now I have to save up another $5,000 to try to get my son a decent car to drive to school and work. I basically paid $5,000 to drive a car for 4 months and 700 miles. What they did is so wrong. Boggus doesn't care about its customers. They are driven by greed. Don't believe the sign on their door posting hours of operation that reads: SUNDAY- AT CHURCH. I don't think so. Heed the warning, let the buyer beware. Think twice before you go to this dealership. I would give it zero stars if I could.",1.0
2,"February 26, 2019","It is) the worst experience of my life .. they are never another deal in this branch. I am so sorry for your service. At first, buy a truck that does not look good. At night. If I know it's my fault for asepting the deal, but they sold me a garbage ... without tires ... all the smooth tires. And one of them was a 5-inch-long slit that put my life in danger. an accident .. a bank that financed me with the highest rate of interests and additional charges of 3000 dollars .. a truck that at the beginning of the treatment started in 15800 I finish in 19900 is a scam and an abuse of trust in my life .. I never felt so stupid to sign a deal .. so fraudulent ... my experience was terrifying .. I never felt so cheated in my life.When buying a truck crap too overvalued .. is a scam..

Es la peor experiencia de mi vida ... nunca son otra cosa en esta rama. Lo siento mucho por su servicio. Al principio, compra un camión que no se vea bien. Por la noche. Si sé que es culpa mía que haya aceptado el trato, pero me vendieron basura ... sin neumáticos ... todos los neumáticos lisos. Y uno de ellos era una hendidura de 5 pulgadas de largo que puso mi vida en peligro. un accidente ... un banco que me financió con la tasa más alta de intereses y cargos adicionales de 3000 dólares ... un camión que al comienzo del tratamiento iniciado en 15800 termino en 19900 es una estafa y un abuso de confianza en mi vida .. Nunca me sentí tan estúpido como para firmar un trato ... tan fraudulento ... mi experiencia fue aterradora ... Nunca me sentí tan engañado en mi vida. Cuando compro una camioneta demasiado sobrevaluada ... es una estafa",1.0

4,"August 25, 2017","It makes sense as to why customer service at Boggus Ford Harligen Tx is so poor when the GM of the dealership possesses none. After repeating to ""Rick"" that I was not there to discuss numbers, but to just view vehicles I was interested in viewing, ""Rick"" continued to intimidatingly ask. I told ""Rick"" that my husband would be the one who would discuss the numbers with him and that I was just there to view the inventory. He told me that I had to give him some numbers and that he knew I had talked to my husband about how much we were looking to spend. I gave him some numbers to which he immediately shot me down by saying it was too low to afford what I was inquiring about. He told me to get in the driving cart he was in to look at other vehicles to which I responded by telling him I already knew which ones he was going to show me and that I was not interested. I told him early on what it was that I was looking for in a car, but he continued to ignore my requests, trying to convince  me of doing things his way. I don't know how this employee ever made it to his position without knowledge in customer service. In the end I told him I was not going to view the vehicles he wanted me to see and asked him for his name to which he responded ""Rick, it's on my shirt"" I asked for his last name, to which he answered ""it's Rick, I'm the only one named ""Rick"" that works here,"" I looked him up on the website and found his full name, picture, and position. It's employees like this that give Ford a bad representation.",1.0
5,"October 18, 2016","One day when I was looking to trade my 05 F150, I was approached by a salesman by the name of Jeanno (Looked up his name on their website).  I talked to him about some incentives that other dealerships were offering and asked if they were offered by Boggus. He said yes. When I told him the deal I had looked at a previous dealership, he looked at me and said, ""I can $6000 off. You ask for 9 or $10,000 off, I say good day to you!"" and brushed his hand as to tell me to leave.He did try to continue talking to me but I left as to avoid an assault charge. Well, I returned because I mistakenly believed it was a good dealership and bought a used 2011 F150 from another salesman (Chris- Good experience). Also, it was the closest FORD dealership to me and I was set on a FORD truck.
It doesn't end there.
 I later traded the 2011 I bought at Boggus to another Ford dealership in another city. I had purchased a FORD ESP extended warranty on the 2011 F150 I traded in and still had plenty of it left. When I went to retrieve my money for the left over warranty(you can do that), I found out that Boggus Ford had signed over my warranty to the person who had bought my traded vehicle without my consent. They weren't even involved in my new deal but I was still dealing with them?? During what felt like an interrogation, they presented to me, a 4x6 yellow crumbled up paper written in pen that stated  I had transferred over the warranty to the new owner. It had a signature that looked like mine but I had never seen that piece of paper before that time. When I asked how informal the paper was, I was told that as long as it had my signature on it, the warranty could be transferred after a small fee. After a bunch of run around, attitude, and calling Ford ESP directly and speaking to a manger by the name of Rudy who told me to call him directly if I had any issues, I eventually retrieved my money. Totally unacceptable. 

I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER PRODUCT FROM BOGGUS FORD AGAIN.

6,"December 12, 2015","Saw a vehicle online priced $7,998 called to see of it was there sure enough it was scheduled a test drive. So now my husband goes into finance office and they slap him with $1,500 down with a $374 monthly payment for 54 months. That's over 100% Apr! What on earth! Husband calls me I tell him to let them know we do not want any warranties or added protection they then go on and tell him he cannot leave lot without all the added bull. I did a lot of research online and warranties are not to be forced upon or a necessary for final sale it is up to customer if they want it. I'm so upset that they would try and scam us like that and I can't believe that for a vehicle that was just under $8000 after 4 1/2 years they would've weasled us over $20,000! That's a brand new car not old preowned. I will not recommend this dealership to anyone. ",1.0

For your vehicle they charge you for it 
And when your car needs repair. 
They say the warranty doesn't cover the problem. ",1.2

9,"August 28, 2007","Boy do I wish I had visited this site before taking my car in for routine preventative maintenance.  My 63 year old sister was leaving for a trip out of state, and the 50,000 mile checkup was due. I took the 2001 Taurus SEL in to Boggus Ford, Harlingen. I was escorted to the jiffy lube station and explained to the 2 men there that I wanted the car checked out as I did not want my sister to have any trouble. I also asked about flushing the transmission. I was told it should be done every 30,000 miles. I authorized the maintenance BIG MISTAKE.Not only did these 2 mechanics not notice the check engine light was on. They blew out all the seals in the transmission. The transmission was not leaking when I took it in, but when I took it out it was leaking. Unfortunately this was not noticed. My sister made it to just north of Dallas and the car quit, the transmission was out. The replacement cost at a local Ford dealer was $3238.38. Ford motor company has agreed to pay a third, Boggus has agreed to pay a third and they want me to pay a third for sloppy work they did.  I want all my money back. This morning I received a phone call from Bracie Wilson the service manager with a deadline to accept their offer or shove it up my ass. I wonder how they are going to like seeing pickets outside their dealership when the winter texans are back.",1.6
10,"February 12, 2004","Bought a car, new, having problems with it. 4x in 1and 1/2 monthsGetting it repaired, inconvinienced and no assistance with the inconvinience. Not the same problem, so nothing can be done as per people at Boggus Ford Harlingen. Meanwhile, I'm left with no car at work, cant take a lunch. Once I get a rental to take me home, it's late in the day and my schedule for other appt's are thrown off. Now, it seems service can not find my car in service dept.  For this kind of trouble, I could have just stayed with my old car of 10 years and I wouldn't be paying as much monthly for car or insurance.  Very fustrated and upset.",1.3
