0,"May 18, 2020","I bought a used 2016 Camry with an extended warranty and after a week of driving it the battery died, check engine light goes on and off, and the tire pressure gauge is always saying low pressure when it's not. Not sure what kind of point inspection these guys run but not a very good one. Also, whenever I try to call someone up there is it rude people hanging up on me or saying I'm xxxx out of luck. My salesperson Edmund Freeman was decent and so was the floor manager at that time. Forget about any help AFTER buying the vehicle with an extended warranty. I hope this helps anyone who's trying to buy a vehicle from this place, just be aware that once you buy that's it they don't care anymore. ",1.8

     Just wanted to let you know I had a frustrating experience at your dealership. Please don’t quote something you can’t honor. Please call if a vehicle gets sold. I’m a mother on a budget going to school and working and paying a house. A new car would be nice but I’ll drive my Honda 2009 until I can find a better deal. There’s a dealership in every corner anyway.  We even came back from Toyota because you could “talk numbers” but don’t honor what I came in looking for which was a Nissan Pathfinder for the price listed and when I came in the sales lady said she had something in the same style. Don’t be wasting my time if you can’t honor what you post. Call your customers before going to waste their whole day looking for a vehicle. That’s misleading in prices. Of course you want to sell a car for more and took forever just figuring out the price. 
I don’t work with people who don’t have INTEGRITY aka MONA( saleslady) ",1.0
2,"April 07, 2020","I'm very disappointed with the service I've received with Town North Nissan. Let me start by saying this, my sales guy was awesome, and continues to be awesome. Unfortunately, it seems like he's the only one who cares about my business. He's worked his butt off to get me into some sweet deals.

But the finance team is unresponsive, the management team is unresponsive, and I don't think anyone else here is held to high standard of professional business conduct / accountability.

I purchased a brand new car in January, and then 2 weeks later, for personal reasons, traded that new car in (along with a used car), to get a smaller commute new car.

Tell me why - it's now April, and the cars still haven't been fully paid off. I understand COVID-19 sucks, but as a business, you have the responsibility to continue providing quality service to your customers.

I had 2 other people I was referring to this dealership (that just moved in from California and need new family vehicles), but I've now asked them NOT TO shop here after all.",1.0
3,"February 28, 2020","We saw a reported price on Carfax, which gets all listing info from the dealerships. So we called TNN to make sure the vehicle was still in inventory and drove quite a distance only to discover they would not honor the advertised price because we did not qualify for the ""discounts""-  on a used car. When we asked what the discounts were that we didn't qualify for, we got a song and dance about rebates, etc. On a used car? The ad did not state there were any qualifications or restrictions on the advertised price. They were totally unwilling to reasonably negotiate the price to even come close to the price they were advertising. Beware of false internet advertising! ",1.0
4,"January 29, 2020","This dealer pulled a bait and switch on me. I researched suv's and crossovers for a year before I decided the Rogue was the best looking one. Then I searched local Nissan dealers for several weeks looking for a deal. I went in to the dealer with my ipad and some notes. I sat down with a sales person and gave them the stock number and vin number of the vehicle I wanted. I also verbally stated that I did not like the Rogues that didnt have the roof rails on it. The sales person went and pulled the stock number I gave her. I looked at it, liked it, thought I was making a deal on it. That was the ONLY one shown to me. We went and got it from another location and brought it back to be cleaned up to go home with me. I had been at the dealership since 11am. It was getting dark outside and I wasnt feeling good. Im ready to be done and go home by this time. Finally got into the finance guy to sign and go. Did all that and went home. Proud of my new car. I loved it. This was Saturday November 23. I got a call from the sales person on December 27. I was on my way to South Padre Island. The sales person seemed frantic. She said I needed to bring the car in and she needed to see me when I came in to pick up my plates. I went in and the sales manager told me that I had the wrong car. I was confused. He said the vin# on my contract was for a different vehicle. One I never looked at until that day and one that I did not like at all. It was the same color but there were lots of differences. No blinkers on the mirrors, no chrome door handles, no roof rails (exactly what I first said to the sales person was I wanted roof rails) no seat warmers etc... I could not believe what he was telling was going on. I cant remember for sure wether it was him or the sales person that told me the sales person was going to be fired. That it was a huge mistake. He said the car that was titled to me would now have to be sold as used if I didnt take it and they were going to take a huge loss on that one and the one I had been driving was going to have to be sold as a demo because I had put almost 1100 miles on it. Now my head is spinning. I specifically said which car I wanted and that was the one shown to me but Im feeling bad that the sales person was going to be fired. The sales person asked if I would take the one I didnt want. I first said no. I dont like the other one but dont want to get her fired. Since the rails were what I liked, I said if you can put rails on that one I will consider it. He went and talked to the parts department and told me they couldnt do it there but I could do it aftermarket. He also said he would add the seat warmers and lifetime maintenance if I would take it. In order to save the person from getting fired I figured oh well, I can spend a couple hundred bucks and put them on myself. So fast forward to this past Monday January 13th. I was supposed to take the car in to have the seat warmers put in and receive the resistal treatment I had already paid for. I dropped the car off and went over to the parts department to ask for the part number to the roof rails so I could go online and buy them and put them on myself. The parts guy told me. You cant put rails on that model. It is not equipped to add them after market. Now Im really mad. The manager knew that when he told I could add them later that I could not. He just wanted me to hurry up and get out of there. Because I felt sorry for the sales person and didnt want them to get fired and because I believed what he told me, I am now stuck with a car that I do NOT like at all. It looks completely different from what I wanted. I was shown one and led to believe that is the one I was dealing on. So, Im waiting for them to call and tell me they were done with the seat warmer install and resistal treatment. I was without my own car (that I hate) for two days. I finally get it back and its some cheap look aftermarket seat warmer, and my car is as dirty as it was when I took it in. The resistal treatment would have required the vehicle to be cleaned. I purposely put one of the seats down in the back seat to see if it would be lifted to treat. The car came back to me the same as it had left me. No evidence that a resistal treatment had been done. I ended up paying 28000 dollars for that piece of crap. When I made the deal I was ok with that because it had the extras I wanted on it. It was listed for sale on their website for 22 or 23 thousand plut tt& l . What I ended up with is a watered down version of what I really wanted and no cost adjustment. Also as of this morning January 17 the vehicle I was first given (The one the dealer said he was going to take a huge loss on) is still listed on their website as brand new with 4 miles on it.I put almost 1100 on it, and drove it for almost 5 weeks.. Same vin # same stock number. They have had ample time to update the inventory on their website. That was another lie told to me. If you go into this dealer to buy, Check your paperwork and check it thoroughly to make sure they havent given you the switch up. I have no doubt in my mind that it was intentional on their part, in kahoots with the finance guy. They threw the sales person under the bus. I also posted this review on their facebook page. The manager Kevin responded to the post stating he wanted to make things right and to contact him. I did. Over a week ago and nothing. ",1.0

PLEASE DON'T BUY A CAR FROM THEM
I bought a car from them not even two weeks ago and the car broke down. After being able to take the car at a good mechanic place, they told me the engine is done. They enjoy my difficult life situation to sell me that xxxx.

6,"November 07, 2019","I've taken my truck to Town North for service for the last couple of years with no issues. They are the only service department who has serviced the vehicle for the last two years. Today it was taken in for an oil change. Afterward, the skid plate was hanging down. When the truck was taken back to their service department the service rep said that the screws holding the skid plate on were stripped. They then said that they're not willing to do anything about it because they can't account for work that may have been done elsewhere where someone else might have stripped the screws...even though they're they only ones who have serviced the vehicle for two years and not once in those two years did they ever mention anything about the screws being stripped. It seems pretty clear that they're not willing to stand behind their shoddy work. To add insult to injury, they then said that they could retap the holes and that they would be willing to produce an estimate for the work if requested.

7,"August 15, 2019","If I could give negative stars I would. This has absolutely been the worst car buying experience. All they are interested in is the sale. They do not care about customer satisfaction at all. If there is a problem, they do not return phone calls. It took two weeks for us to get our car after the purchase and when we did the things that were supposed to be fixed were not. I have been trying for over a month to get the issue resolved and as of now, I have had four people on seven different occasions tell me they would call me back. I have yet to receive a phone call. Do not buy from them!",1.0
8,"August 06, 2019","Brandon’s sales tactic includes: repeatedly attempting to get us to purchase a “protection package” for $2,000 while we were working out numbers on the car; this was included into the negotiations even though I refused to purchase this package multiple times.  He did not say what else came with this package besides a window tints, wheel locks, and protection for the door cup.  When asked if this was mandatory, his only response was “it is negotiable”. He refused to remove this as part of the price of the car.  

We specifically wanted a fully loaded trim with leather seats, but he repeatedly informed us that it was cheaper to buy a lower trim model that has cloth seats and then purchasing aftermarket leather seats through a company he/ his dealership can recommend.

I’m glad Brandon at least offered us water, but all we were given was a styrofoam cup with cold water.  I’ve never been to a new car dealership that does not have bottled water for customers.",1.0

10,"June 30, 2019","This is quite possibly the worst experience I've ever had at a Nissan dealership.  I arrived for my oil change appointment at 9:45 (my appointment was at 10am) and was told that it would be approximately 3 hours of wait time.  I stated that I had scheduled an appointment, and was told that appointments were not guaranteed, and they were extremely busy.  I was not offered a ride anywhere, nor a loaner for the day, while they took three hours to change my oil.  They only asked if I was going to wait or drop it off.  I didn't have much else to do, and I had brought a book, so I just told them I'd wait.  I didn't have much of a choice as I am new to the area, and didn't have anyone who could have come picked me up.  About 15 minutes after I got seated, I got a call from one of their sales people, asking if I wanted to upgrade to a new vehicle.  What great sales tactics they have!  I politely declined and started to read my book. 

After three hours of waiting, I asked for an update, and was told my brakes were wearing thin and should be changed, along with a brake fluid flush to ensure that everything was operating normally.  I ok'd the brake work, and was told they'd have me out as soon as possible.  I tried to be patient, and not cause a scene, but I was starting to get frustrated that no one had even said anything to me to follow up on my repairs two hours later.  Finally, 6 hours after I arrived I asked to speak to the service manager (Garrett), after watching people arrive after me, and leave before me.  He was a complete xxxxxx and acted like I was an inconvenience to him, because I was trying to figure out what the status on my vehicle was.  He gave me some BS answer about them working on appointments first, to which I responded that appointments are not guaranteed!!  He left to go find out what was happening with my vehicle, but by the time he returned, the service advisor had my paperwork ready for me to sign. 

They didn't have any respect for me or my time, and it's frustrating to think we pay them to be treated like this.  I will never return to this awful place.  By the looks of other reviews posted, I'm not the only one who's had issues at this location.  What a joke!    ",1.8

12,"February 09, 2019","If you want to see blood sucking leeches visit TOWN NORTH NISSAN dealer Sales representative will greet you with smile and lure you for a deal. I had a pathetic and total disrespectful treatment by the sales team. Demand you to pay 500$ and even threaten me. They do all tricks to convince you, beg you for their commission. I see them as professional cheats well equipped and trained to cheat customers. Such a pathetic shameless humans, just employed to cheat customers. Unfortunately bought new and used car here because I trust Nissan cars. In both the occasions I was cheated. Trust me, in the night online prices will be less but in the morning the prices will go higher. Strategy to make us visit the dealership. I was charged 3k extra as a hidden charge and I wasn't aware unless until I made my first payment. I don't have a choice other than paying it. my hard earned money is cheated by these leeches. Don't fall in to trap. Visit other dealership even if it is slightly expensive, you will be treated as fellow human being. Bought Used CPO nissan, told me 3 major recalls were already taken care. Later I found out it was never done. Immediately after I picked up the car when I drove the car back home, heard noise from rear side.later found out Wheel bearing has to be replaced. Such a stressful purchase and eventually ended up paying 3k extra for something I never opted for it. I WILL NEVER EVER VISIT TOWN NORTH NISSAN IN MY LIFE. BE CAREFUL WITH THE SALES AND FINANCE TEAM.",1.0

14,"September 22, 2018","Do not buy from this dealer. Super rude and underhanded Finance. Do not care about you as a person, human being. Do not meet their commitment on their wall at all.",1.0
15,"August 02, 2018","Beware of this dealership. At the moment we are not sure whether they are extremely careless or wilfully delaying processes, but we intend to find out and report them. More than three months after buying a car we still do not know if our title paperwork has been filed - although we know that it wasn't filed as recently as last week. To be clear, they are legally required to file this paperwork within 30 days of purchase. The worst part is that Nissan Town North simply do not care.

We bought a car from them in April. Long story short, they ordered the wrong car, and after trying to coerce us into taking a different car, reluctantly were able to locate a car in the color and model that we had actually purchased. We had to wait three weeks, but at the start of May we got the car we had originally ordered. That car was hit by a truck a few days later. Thankfully my husband was unharmed, but the car was damaged. Geico declared it a total loss in June. We had to reach out to Nissan Town North for evidence of title. Some time later in July someone in finance sent us a title application. We have to assume that the original title paperwork was never filed. 

Weeks later we were told that the title paperwork was filed incorrectly. We went back in twelve days ago and resigned, and were assured it would be filed within a couple of days. We finally heard back to repeated messages two days ago, and nobody was able to tell us if the paperwork was filed. Yesterday - after tracking down a Manager - we heard back, but regarding the wrong car (we also bought a Rogue from them earlier in the year). NOBODY CAN TELL US IF THEY HAVE FILED THIS PAPERWORK AFTER MORE THAN THREE MONTHS. 

Meanwhile, we have an outstanding insurance claim that Geico are waiting to pay when we have the paperwork. Which means we have made three car payments to Nissan for a car that was totalled three months ago while we wait - and wait - for them to actually do something that they were legally required to do within 30 days of purchase. 

I can't even express how angry it makes me to be treated this way, or to know that we cannot trust a car dealership to file title paperwork. They do not care. Their attitude is incredible - shockingly - casual. No explanations. No apologies. 

It's hard to believe that things are so chaotic that they literally do not know if this paperwork was filed, which leads me to suspect that it is wilfullly being delayed, or that even more mistakes have been made by people who could not care less about their customers.",1.0
16,"January 20, 2018","I have had issues with my recent car since I leased it. It makes a loud screeching sound when you go over 70 mph from the window indicating that the seal is not tight. I took it in and I was told they couldn't hear it (have to be deaf not to) so I wasted a day at the dealership and have learned to deal with it over the last two years of my lease. Since I have a maintenance plan for them, I need to bring my car in for oil changes. Over the last two years the staff has been beyond incompetent and unable fix issues but since it's a lease I make do as I have been driving Nissan cars for over 10 years. Each time I bring my car in for an oil change - with an appointment - it takes longer and longer for it to get done. When I first started coming here service was fantastic - the reps were fantastic. Today's service... I had an 11 am appointment and had to wait in line like I didn't have an appointment and I wasn't checked in til 11:20. They offered to shuttle me to the domain to wait and gave me a 3-1/2 hour wait time - which is a lot but I have gotten used to that from past service from this year. I was told I would be called when my car was ready. I then never received a call from the service rep, called in to check and was told my rep would call me in a few and be hung up on. Never received that call back from him but did over a good deal later get a call from the shuttle saying they would be there to pick me up in 5 min. 15 min later, the shuttle driver arrives at my location. I get back to the dealership and I am told that it will take 10 more min to get my paperwork together. I then sit around for more than 10 minutes. I waited for my car on a day that I needed to get my homework for over 4 hours and 45 minutes. That is 4 hours and 45 min for an oil change and inspection WITH an appointment. I ask for a manager, they instead send some underling to him out who when I ask why ea time I come in it takes longer and longer to get the car done, just makes excuses and offers no true explanation or solution for change. If they ask why I'm not getting another Nissan, I put it completely on their lengthy service waits, inefficient appointment system, and service staff. There is no excuse for poor customer service and these wait times. I cannot get out of my lease so I am stuck right now but I won't be forever. You can guarantee you lost a customer for life.",1.0

When i returned to tell them that I decided on a different color, and different trim level, they suggested that they could pull a truck that I wanted from Round Rock Nissan and it would be at Town North Monday morning. I went into financing and was quoted a 4.99% interest rate with a 759 credit score on a new vehicle. I was then told thats the lowest it would go because of the Nissan rebates.  I signed, and then found out later that next day that the truck they sold me VIN# 5555XYZ had been previously sold, (which would null the sale).  After finding out that they did not have the truck that I wanted, I went to another Nissan dealership was quoted a better price, 2% lower interest,  and received fantastic customer service as well as drove the truck home that day.  

Now, I have visited Town North 3 times and tried to get my refund for my $5000 down payment, and I am told only 1 person is able to do the refund, and told he is not at work every time. Then I speak with the finance manager on the phone, and he tells me that ANY management can process refunds.  I also then receive a call from Hertz saying that the dealership does not have the keys to my rental car that I left and surrendered the keys to before I drove off in they're loaner truck. I contact the dealer about this and I am told by the sales manager

""town north did not rent a car from hertz""... 

 it seems to me, that once I changed my mind about what truck I wanted, that town north made it extremely difficult to get anything done properly and is trying to find anyway possible to inconvenience me.  Piss poor customer service, very sales driven, hassle and pressure was consistent.  If you want a Nissan, please do yourself a favor and go to another Nissan dealer.",1.0

I was told to slam on the brakes doing 70mph on a highway to ""fix"" the brake problem, I was told they just need to ""dust"" them, I was told quote from an employee :"" they probably just put the cheap, xxxxty pads on there, since you got a used vehicle, they didn't want to spend big bucks "". Seriously. Professionalism at its finest ! We finally get to sort out where the problem is, and the service managers offered a half price reduction on the parts they worked, even though that's not what was causing the problem.

Their business practices are also evident in that they have more 1 star or worse reviews than they ahve 2-5. STAY AWAY from this dealership. Not only would I never buy anything from this business, I will also now not consider a Nissan. We went out to Austin today with a very specific goal of driving every full size SUV available and then being a CASH buyer. When we arrived at this dealership (like others we had visited today) we barely got out of the car before a salesman appproached us. Apparently telling him that we were NOT buying TODAY and only wanted to look at cars (again - like we did at other dealers) was considered rude. We were told that no cars were open. I refused to go inside and give them any personal information, rather proceeded to look at the specific vehicle I wanted to see (which was open by the way). After a VERY long period of time a young man approached us and basically asked us to leave because we were rude to his salesman. As we walked back towards the office I asked to speak to the general manager and at such point he became extremely rude and mouthy. My husband looked at me and said ""don't worry - we will just take this up elsewhere"". At that point this young man reached out touched my husband and yelled ""no you go see him"". You can imagine that we immediately tried to get to the GM's office but were met at the door by several people threatening to call the police. Mind you this was after THEIR sales manager was extremely rude, bowed up to my husband, touched him and continued to be nothing more than a smart alec. At one point, the GM came up to the conversation but quickly retreated to his office without so much as an apology. I have to say that I have never seen such poor customer service and behavior in all my 50 years. I will leave it to this for this establishment ...

98,"December 08, 2016","Beyond a bad car buying experience - the finance department there commits fraud. I had financing in place with my credit union but they gave me a song and dance about how I wouldn't get additional rebates unless I financed with them. So I agreed to that - and then after spending 20 minutes trying to hard sell me some additional warranty on top of standard, they presented me with a contract that didn't include all the rebates the salesmen promised. Of course, the figures presented were flashed as quickly as possible - unlike the warranty pitch which they spent 20 minutes explaining. I caught their mistake as I did the math quickly on my own and made them correct it. Signed the final contract at the right price and drove off. Only to get a letter from Nissan finance a few weeks later to confirm first payment - of the higher, wrong amount!!! 

I spoke immediately with Lee in the finance department and he said they would correct the mistake and he would call me back the next week. No word from them yet and it still has not been corrected. I did not believe from minute one that Lee just forgot to apply the rebates I was promised but I gave them the benefit of the doubt because they corrected it before I agreed to the final sales price and signed a contract. However, now I know my instinct was right because they sent the wrong contract to Nissan finance hoping I would not notice the small difference in monthly payment amount - and they are not doing anything to help correct the ""mistake.""

They will conceal any minor or major issues that a used vehicle has just to get it sold, then tell you to take it to a shop to get repaired because you bought As Is. I understand the circumstances when you purchase a used vehicle As-Is, but integrity is lost when you as a salesperson logs off and doesnt try to make it right to a customer within the first hours or days.
 Regardless if the issue cost $30 or $40 a dealership with Morals would love to see every customer happy, not leave them to address an issue that was concealed. I have purchased many used vehicles and if i drive off the lot and the check engine light or anylight turn on immediately and i mentioned it to them they have simply said ""Bring it in let us check it out"". They will tell you your due date is one day yet when you get your payment stub in the mail it reflects otherwise. Oh yeh, and they will have you believe its a requirement to purchase warranty then when you receive warranty info in mail realize that It was not a requirement, which only caused me to borrow a higher loan amount. I tried to contact them multiple times and only get transferred to a line that only rings. If they had followed through and rectified the issue i recognized After leaving the lot within 24hrs then i might have added a star.

108,"August 10, 2016","My recent experience with Town North closely matches another recent review here, even down to the same salesman (who's name I will leave out)

I called to inquire about a truck at Town North since the online info was very limited.  Immediately the salesman pressured me to make an appointment.  Evidently, if you want to see one of their vehicles, you have to have an appointment.  I don't appreciate a high pressure sell, and said I was just calling to get some basic info and to see if they were going to post some pictures online.  To his credit, the salesman offered to take a few pictures, and text them to me.  I really like the look of the truck, and made plans to go there during my lunch break.  My wife met me and we took the truck for a test drive.  Overall we liked the truck and wanted to see what kind of deal we could get.
I told the salesman that I only had an hour, and that I would need to head back to work after they finished going over our car for a trade in value.  He said that if I wasn't able to stay, that they wouldn't be able to work any deals.  
Seriously, you have all my info, you know what I'm trading in, what truck I'm interested in but you can't do anything without me being there?  
He said he couldn't 'go to bat' for me if I wasn't willing to stay.  I let him know, that I was serious about purchasing this truck, but I still had to get back to work before my lunch break was over and that I could return after work.
True to his word, they hadn't done any work on the deal, and we had to start where we left off.  When he came back from 'talking to his manager' I was presented with a low ball offer on my trade in and not a penny off the truck. Evidently my car had several issues that they would have to address before they could even put it on the lot for resale.  I was prepared for one particular issue with the car, and even had an estimate on the cost to repair it.  Seeing that they weren't going to budge on the pricing, I got up to leave.  All of sudden, the salesman said that he could go back to his manager and see if we they could work the deal some more.  This went back and forth several times with them barely budging on price, and him pressuring me to commit to each new deal.  
Eventually I left since it was getting late, and the salesman assured me that he'd let me know what they found out the next morning.  I never heard from him that entire day.  Turned out he had the day off.  So I emailed him detailing out what I felt was a fair price for the truck and a trade in value of my car.  We had pre-approval from our bank, and I was ready to make a deal if we could just agree on a price.
Over the next day, we went back and forth and finally met in the middle of where they had started and where I wanted to be.  I called the salesman to confirm the pricing so I could let our bank know.  He said that he hadn't actually got his managers approval on the final price and that I'd need to come in again so they'd know I was still serious.  I couldn't believe that after all the back and forth, we were still basically in the same position as when I first came in.  I told him that I was at home and would need some time to get back to the lot.
Before I left the house, the salesman calls me and says the truck sold 5 minutes after we had hung up, and asked if I would be interested in another truck they had on the lot!

On Thursday June 16 2016. Had been speaking and texting with a sales man by the name of Lee Jenkins. Agreed on a price and terms on an extra key, ( As the car only had 1 Key) for a used Nissan Altima. Got off work early and text  Lee Jenkins that I was ON THE WAY THERE  FROM SAN ANTONIO TO AUSTIN TO PURCHASE CAR, that we had previously come to terms with. As I traveled from San Antonio to Austin I text 3 different times( as I was stopped) that I was ON THE WAY. Received same number of text back, acknowledging the fact I was headed there for car. The trip was made even more difficult as I am a disabled US Marine Corps Veteran..... And well, don't need to tell surrounding folks of Austin about the traffic and in 100 degree weather.   I walked into Town North Delership in Austin around 5:30 pm and immediately asked for Lee Jenkins. About 2 seconds after meeting with him he stated, That the car had just been sold and pointed at a young lady in a middle office. 
This is what really bothered me and made me sure not to deal with such people, for some reason Lee Jenkins the salesman informed me The young lady had just walked in to buy it and didn't ask for any discount or sale price.... ""She PAID FULL PRICE"" he said. So that let me know that Town North Austin sales people would give me a 40yr old man savings but wouldn't pass the same deal on to an Unsuspecting young lady???????
Shady!!!!!  Basically this young woman over paid 1500-2000 dollars for a used 2013 Nissan Altima. Of Course they tried to get me into something else I wasn't interested in but at this point I just asked to speak to the sales manger( small short petite man) made me wait around 5-10 minutes as he acted like he was on the computer (glass cubicles) at this point he comes out, NO Apologies ask me to come into a private cubicle,( away from other perspective customers.... Of course) About half a sentence from asking  what had just happened? Sales Manager cuts me off and states,"" Look  I know all that just happened, so you don't need to go into it"". I then stated Well where I'm from when a man gives his word we got a deal, a man is held to that. With a blank uninterested look on his face he just sat there. Wow!   
Hey, if money is no object and you want an over priced  vehicle that you're  gonna have to watch and not let out of your sight till the keys are in hand...... Town North Nissan in Austin is your place. I will never buy here or recommend this dealership to anyone!    Milt. ",1.0
112,"June 01, 2016","Dishonest salesman  will tell you anything to get you in the door.   Surprised they also were bold enough to yell at customers while I was there and then repeatedly talked over us while we asked about the car and deal.  I could immediately see why  they are a low rated dealer.

Salesman Mike became visibly upset and yelled repeatedly at us.   He seemed to get angry easily and couldn't take responsibility for lying about the car price he quoted to us.   He said ""he has other xxxx to do"" and ""he didn't know the price"" after negotiating with us.    it's unfortunate that he couldn't manage himself in a normal interaction. 

We talked with the Sales manager and offered us half of what CarMax or KBB would give for our car too, saying they only give the lowest trade in value even though our car is pristine.  They clearly prey on the uninformed or people in a difficult spot.   Be weary because they will not be offering anything remotely fair of a deal. 

The salesman also seemed to argue over who would take the sale on our car.  This was disconcerting as we were right  near them.  

 Also the Dealer lied about car availability. They use high pressure tactics saying the car is being shipped to wholesale today if you  don't buy now.   The car is still available however.   

In summary, they will lie to get you in the door.  Make you sit for long periods, bring very unreasonable offers to the table, and yell and argue in a childish manner if you make any reasonable discussion or counter offers.

2. He promised to offer a full tank of gas, free tint change, and additional oil change services but I didn't see anything. 
3. The finance guy in the small room was even worse. After you pick the second option(not the most expensive one) he looks so mad and wants to kick you out of the room! Dude, how bad do you need the money?! If you don't respect your customer, you should get another job.

Service Advisors (excluding Martin F, I won't mention any names) I had my car serviced for steering wheel fluid hose replacements and the return valve needed a new hose and the advisor stated to me that it would take couple of days to come in. The next Monday 12/30/14 I took the car in to get the return valve replaced the order was taken care of but the part never came that was a problem poor communication with the customer on parts issue and order. Then on 1/19/2015 I stopped by to get the car fixed since it was about 1 month the part was never received and again I called later Saturday 1/31/2015 and the part was available I scheduled an appointment the next Friday 2/6/2015 and found out after 2 hours it was the wrong part REALLY? THE WRONG PART?!?! It personally made me offended in your service team member who did not order the correct part. 

Martin Flores did an excellent job in getting my car serviced and ensured the correct part was ordered, he communicated with me every step of the way. When the correct part came in he showed me the part and had the technicians install it in no time. Kudos to Martin on a job well done.

Parts department 
The staff member who works in parts was rude and unprofessional when I had to get my Altima car key battery replaced by accusing me of opening up improperly I explained it was fine by the service advisors and former parts employee. He also kept telling me the problem and how much it would cost to replace if it became damage in a rude and unprofessional manner. His attitude was inappropriate.

He actually wouldn't even tell me what rate he was basing these payments off of when I asked, and told me I didn't make any sense when I said I wanted to know the rate because I was concerned with what I'm paying in total for the car. I never even met with anyone in financing until they called 3 times after I walked out, saying that he never gave Kevin any numbers and didn't know where he was getting the information from. They tried making a deal to get me to buy the car, but didn't come through on it and that really worked out for the best.

Unfortunately, everything didn't like what I thought. When I came there, a staff came out and asked me what I need to do. I told him everything I need. He asked me: ""did I buy this car right here.""

I will NEVER BUY A VECHILE FROM THEM or recommend anybody else to buy from them.",1.0

149,"February 16, 2012","Bought a used Armada that needed three repairs, and the dealer committed to make the repairs.  When we brought the car in for the repairs, they only completed one of the three, and would not complete the other two repairs.  They said that the salesman who sold us the car was no longer employed at that dealer, and they would only make the one repair.

Also, they took 3 weeks to send the pay-off to our bank for the our trade-in, so we had to pay a late fee to our bank, and were at risk of having a negative credit report posted from our bank -- just because this dealer took so long to pay off the trade-in.

Be very careful if you do business with these people.",2.0
150,"March 30, 2010","Went here after a really bad experience at another Nissan dealership. Lies about price on internet & chat. 103 of the vehicle we were looking at used and in stock and they still wouldn't budge on price AND were going to stick us with an awful interest rate to boot. We gave ourselves a couple of days to look at other dealers and decided to give Town North Nissan a shot. Got a fantastic price, fantastic interest rate, fantastic salesman, better everything at Town North Nissan. Ask for Ray Lewis & save yourself some money and a headache!!!!",5.0
151,"March 10, 2010","Let me start by saying I hate buying cars. It is not fun and typically takes forever. My husband and I was searching for an Altima online and sent in an inquiry to the 3 dealerships in town and Ray is the only person that called us right after we sent in the inquiry. He walked me through the internet buying process on the phone and made me feel comfortable. I didn't get any calls from the other dealerships but received e-mails from them. Needless to say, we met with Ray that Saturday. He was a joy to work with from the first moment we met. He told us everything he was going to before he did it. He didn't just disappear for 30 minutes at a time, leaving us wondering where he was or what he was doing. From the time we got there to the time we left, we were only there for 2 1/2 hrs. The only reason we were there that long was because the gentlemen in finance were very busy. Once we got in there, Matt was also a pleasant suprise. He talked to us like we mattered to him and we weren't just another bozo buying a car. We didn't realize until we were talking to Matt that Ray was the manager over the internet department. He never said anything and just moved through the process like any other sales person does. We could have just got lucky by working with a manager. Hopefully, all his sales people are that nice. We will definitely be back to trade in my husbands car sometime next year.",4.8
152,"June 30, 2009","Lets start off by saying my husband (currently serving in Mosul Iraq, USA) and myself (also in the USA at Fort Hood) were estatic about buying our first Nissan!!  We were taking our time in looking for the perfect SUV to travel in, pull our fishing boat, and comfort for my disease (Rheum. Arthritis).  WE finally found it!  I was the Nissan Armada!!  Just beautiful!  Well we couldnt find a 2008 Armada that we want, so we decided to wait for the dealer to make the order for the perfect vehicle we want to suite all of our needs!  Well the vehicle took three months to finally get here, after hearing late march, then late may then the third week of July, from the dealer Montey they kept changing the date, the truck came early!  It arrived this past saturday, 27 June.  After calling the dealer and wanting an update on the vehicle and several times he would not return my call so I had to call him again.  He called me Sat. afternoon to congrat. me on the vehicle arriving!  I got in contact with my husband that is communicating with me thru phone/email.  He was excited because when he comes home on RR he had a new truck to drive!  Montey kept pushing the issue on coming in on Monday, I told him no mondays are busy days at my work, but he insisted so I had to wheel and deal with my bosses to miss a half a day.  Did I mentin the drive is an hour a 15mins?  So Montey ensured me the truck will be ready to go and Ill be on my merry little way!  So I brought my mom down there and we showed up at 1:30pm, first we had to wait around for Montey to make his way to us to great us, which took about 20mins, he made it quick and pretended to get everything started with the paperwork.  After several minutes went by Clayton came out and asked if we talked to Montey?  Well this was a tag team bit, because neither one of them were talking to each other or they were trying to stahl me more.  They brought us keys to the truck parked out side, (my soon to be new truck)!!  So my mom and I went out to the truck to check it out, absolutely BEAUTIFUL! GORGEOUS! COMFORTABLE! and mind you I havent even drove the truck yet....nor did I want to because I was going off of the name ""Nissan"", I know you guys make good vehicles and I trusted you for a good deal and outstanding customer service.  1st lets say the truck was not wiped down from the travel, 2nd there were two water streak marks on the back window 3rd the AC was NOT working.  Sorry but at 100 degree weather, the first 100 point check I would do is check the dag on AC!!  Well Montey was not listening to us when we said, hey its hot in this truck, oh no, so we got out of the truck he said he would have them wipe it down again, and check the AC.  Then made a few comments on how lucky I was to get the truck because if it was off of highest bidder I wouldnt have gotten it, and how he had ""so many people lined up"" to get this vehicle but he pushed us right to the front so he was doing us a favor in giving us the truck.  Now keep in mind yes they were offering us a Damm good deal on the truck (well I thought so) but did I mention it took them 2 hours to even offer a drink to us while we were waiting on them with being behind with customers?  I had to ask for water... the receptionist over heard me talking about water, but ignored us because she wasnt making a commission.  So now we are on round two, the mechanic brings the truck around again, and mom goes out to look at the truck again, nothing was cleaned and once again the AC still isnt working...Clayton joins us out in the truck to get a couple of initials and he notices the AC isnt working so he says he is going to get it working for us and takes it to the mechanics again...at this time we are on four hours of being there...There is a gentleman sitting by us that is as frustrated as we were because he has been sitting there forever waiting on service!  At this point I am angry, I speak to Clayton and tell him how disappointed I was in the customer service was and for a 2010 vehicle not to work!  I explained to him that Montey scheduled me an appointment for 1:00 and here it is 4:30pm and still NO Paperwork!  Did I mention I came down with my trade in that was cleaned out, my clean slate title, My loan check from my bank, the two set of the GMC 2008 Acadia, and a credit card to pay my taxes.  I had this deal planned out for THREE MONTHS!  This was a golden sale!  As I was done with telling Clayton how I felt, he could understand the frustration, but knew if I left ""I would be back"" to get the vehicle.  At this point my diabetic mother needed to eat, so we were going down the street to eat.  Montey caught us on our way out the door and ask why were leaving, I then proceeded on to tell him what I thought about his customer service and organization of time and paperwork!  Lets say I was madder then a hooker that was paid for doing services!  He proceeded to comment on every one had appointments and everyone was late, why should I get any different treatment than the rest of them.  They were backed up and there was no reason help me any sooner then he could.  Then he made a few more comments on I am lucky to get this truck!  So I told them we are going to eat and call me when it was ready, and I was going to think about this transaction I was about to make.  This was a big investment for me and my husband to make, this was a big deal for us.  We didnt want to get something half as and fail us later.  This was a life transion, I mean most folks now a days dont have 50,000 to throw out the window.  I tried to make this easy on them, my husband and myself!  I dont believe in wasting time, like me typing this long email to you.  But I feel this should be handled and I hope no one else has to go thru this emotional rollercoaster ride and rudeness!  Well Clayton called me about an hour later (about 5:45pm) at this point I have talked myself out of my dream SUV and Im just pissed off for the whole 2 hour trip home (oh did I mentioned I tried to get there early so I could avoid Austin TX rush hour traffic?).  So 3 1/2 hours total of driving there and back, rudeness, no hospitality, no customer service, no time management/organization and a uncomfortable and cold atmosphere waiting area, 4 hours of just sitting there hoping to take the truck home with a working AC. I get a call from Clayton an hour later and I told him right off the back, Im on my way home, he was in disbelief and asked ""so you dont want the truck?""  I said no give it to the several folks you got in line waiting.  Once we get home, I have a message from Montey apologizing for the wait, but then he tapped danced around the reason, then he offered me an OIL change and DETAIL!  What the hell......waste my time for 7 hours of the day, Im in my army uniform with every thing ready to purchase a Armada, I had to take off a half of day of work which by the way Mondays are the worst days to miss!  But Montey insisted....and your going to offer a OIL CHANGE.  Needless to say this was the WORST experience ever...but.... they were offering me a Great deal for the Armada and they were soooooooooo friendly on the phone with me before the incident, but when they knew I wanted the truck and drove an hour and half a way I wasnt going to leave I was going to wait for the truck.  Well I didnt, and boy I have a different feeling on Nissan but I doooo love the Armada 2010, so Im torn but I'd rather pay another 5,000 for a Toyota and good customer service.  Thanks for your time, and sorry it was so long but trust you me the word spreads in Killeen TX, US army and family.  Oh did I mention my husband called with disappointment because now we dont have a truck and his was had to go thru the stress of the dealership and rudeness.  He wasted a call from Iraq....",1.8
153,"March 16, 2006","This place is absolutely HORRIBLE. First off, their selection is really limited. They happen to have in their stock an Xterra that I fell in love with from the internet promo I read. As a first time buyer in their early-twenties, I realized that I would have a difficult time getting approved for an auto loan on my own. After getting a co-signer, they all assured me that I would be driving off in my car that same day. 4 days later, no car, and I am utterly disappointed and frustrated with them. I called over and over and over again, just to get all of their answering machines to which they did NOT respond. When I did get ahold of them, I found out that they sold my xterra already, and they wanted to get me into a pathfinder. I HATE PATHFINDERS, and I had no intention of getting one. NEVER EVER EVER buy a car from this place, the service is horrible, from all of the salesmen, especially Inno and Boon. Those men need to leave the car business and open up their own knife-selling shop or something.",1.0
