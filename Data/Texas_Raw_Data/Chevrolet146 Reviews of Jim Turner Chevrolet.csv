Without a doubt, the team at Jim Turner Chevrolet is the best around. No pressure. Fast responses. Honest answers. Just an A+ experience, and Josh was great. If you hate car shopping (like I did!), give Josh and the team at Jim Turner a call. You will not regret it.",5.0
1,"January 07, 2020","I bought my (new to me) vehicle from Josh, and the entire experience was so easy! We drove in from out of town, barely making it before closing time.

Easiest car-buying experience I have ever had. Thanks Josh!",5.0

We would recommend Josh anytime!!

26,"May 17, 2018","Found the car on the internet. While messaging Mr. Riley we found out their had been a deposit on the car and a couple were trying to get financing. Four days later Mr. Riley let me know the car was back available so we did everything we could by email since we were out of Fort Worth. My wife and daughter were returning home from college station after going to graduation ceremonies for a friend and stopped by to see the car and Josh. The next morning my wife drove me down to McGregor to Jim Turner's Chevrolet and we met with Josh and Amanda and completed the financing. The vehicle we purchased only had 20,000 miles on it for a 2013 Lincoln. Their dealership also had installed four new tires. Totally recommend Josh and Amanda for an excellent car buying experience.

P.S. They have my dream car in the middle of the showroom floor. A brand new white with black interior, tops off, Chevy Corvette Stingray.   ",5.0

32,"March 05, 2018","My wife and I had been looking at cars in the Austin and Dallas areas about 3 weeks prior to purchasing our new vehicle.  The day we were going to Dallas to make our purchase we received a call saying the car we wanted to look at was sold the night before.  Very disappointed we decided to skip Dallas and head over to Jim Turner Chevrolet which was less than 10 mins from our home. I sent and email mentioning I was interested in one of the used Tahoe premiers they had on the lot and the rest is history.  I received a return call within minutes of the email asking me what time I would like to look at the car.  When I arrived the Tahoe was washed and waiting out front to test drive. Trevor introduced himself and showed us everything we needed to know on the vehicle. My wife fell in love with the car and we took it home that day.  Thanks Trevor and Jim Turner cheverolet for getting us the car we wanted without having to leave town.  

Sincerely,

40,"December 31, 2017","Bought a Chevy Traverse about 3 weeks ago. Had been car shopping all day and was ready to call it quits. Didn't think we would find a good deal close to home (Waco) but were so happy to end up at Jim Turner Chevrolet. Kristen Koch was so good. Not pushy and didn't act like the typical car salesman. I had experienced a bait and switch at another dealership a week before. We told her what we were looking for so she lets us test drive it. She answered all of our questions and never tried to sell us something more expensive. My husband and I even decided to ""sleep on it"" before making the decision, but because of her, we decided to go back and buy that day. She had actually left to go home but when they called her back she came right away and never seemed bothered by my indecisiveness. She called to check on us even after we had left and even sent us a Christmas card. She is awesome. And finance guy was great. He never tried to change the structure of how I wanted to do my payments or how much I put down (like I experienced at another dealership). All around great customer service and we love our new car. They turned our entire car buying experience into a great one. ",5.0

43,"December 11, 2017","With a totaled vehicle, and a short timeline on my rental; I walked in with a small budget, high hopes, and no clue what I wanted. Ryan went over a few options and we looked at a couple cars. Instantly fell in love with a 2017 Cruze! He and Amanda worked to get the payments and packages where I needed them.

I am so happy about this purchase and I really feel like it was a steal of a deal getting my car for the price I did, it’s my dream car! Thanks Ryan for helping me find it! 

Also thanks to Amanda for helping me with all of the financing! She was so organized and great to work with.

45,"December 04, 2017","Ryan Haskell at Jim turner is the Man! I had spent some time looking for a new truck and wanted to get a Toyota. I ended up going to a few Toyota dealers. Everyone of them was down right disrespectful and treated like I was just some 5 year old kid. I ended up going to Jim Turner looking at a used Colorado on my lunch break. I knew the one I wanted to look at but when I got there Ryan got the keys to all 3 they had on the used lot. Ryan answered every question and was EXTREMELY knowledgeable about the Colorado. I took it out on a test drive and didn't really like it so I left but I left happy with the experience. That night I tried the Toyota dealer in Waco, It was a mistake. The next day I was back at Jim Turner to look at new Silverados. Ryan got the three I liked right next to each other with no pressure. I drove them and picked the one I liked. Again Ryan answered every question and was EXTREMELY knowledgeable about the truck. I drove away with my 2017 Silverado and I will never go to another dealer but Jim Turner.

57,"August 24, 2017","I contacted Mark Stewart about needing a newer Suburban, he set me up with Ryan Haskell. I told Ryan what I wanted in my suburban, he took some notes, and we parted ways. Ryan stayed in touch with me for a couple weeks as he searched for the perfect vehicle for me and my family. After a couple weeks, I was picky and not in a hurry so the couple weeks was fast for what I wanted, Ryan texted me some pictures of the ""Unicorn"" Suburban as he referred to it. I went and test drove the car and told Ryan to start the paperwork. Ryan called and said everything was ready and I probably spent a total of 45 minutes in the dealership finalizing the paperwork. By far the smoothest car transaction every. Also they gave me an excellent price for my trade in!

Jim Turner Chevrolet came through for us when we found ourselves in a tough situation. Our salesperson Kristin was very helpful. She listened to our dilemma and what we were looking for. 

She was able to find a great little car for us that was exactly in our budget. We are thoroughly enjoying the vehicle.",4.8
61,"August 01, 2017","I researched the Chevy Colorado and GMC Canyon extensively before finding a dealer.  I went to 4 other dealers looking at options and features, but most importantly, I was looking at atmosphere.  

Ryan was extremely accommodating, and you could tell he really wanted me to get exactly what I wanted in a truck.  He gave no pushback, and he didn't try to minimize my ""wish list"".  Two other dealers I visited suggested ""maybe I didn't need this"", and ""most people don't do that"".  I'm the customer, and I need whatever I think I need, and Ryan was spot-on.  The options the truck didn't have, he could get.  Great attitude when helping people BUY a truck as opposed to selling what you want to SELL.  Ryan showed me the closest truck to what I wanted, and he committed to making the rest happen.  

I said yes to the truck, asked for my additional options and the best price, and then I waited.  I waited 2 minutes, and Ryan came back with a great price for everything I wanted.  Truly no-haggle, just a great price for a great truck.  Win - Win.  

My buying experience was quick, but not rushed.  Pleasant, but not cheesy.  If you're looking for an incredible deal on an amazing Chevy truck, stop by Jim Turner to see Ryan and the Team.

I was checking for a reliable dealership to repair damage on my Ford Flex. He escorted me to the body shop where I met Derrick Guin. I highly respect these fine young men, as they are very professional. The work done on my car was absolutely amazing. I have 3 phase paint and it is very hard to match exactly.

We set up an appointment for a Saturday; Scott was waiting for us with a friendly handshake and smile. The vehicle we were looking at online was already in the front and Scott showed it to us with no hassle and no pressure. After a test drive he showed us around McClaren and really made us feel special. When we were ready to sign the paperwork, we met Joe Franks and had a wonderful experience with him. Joe kept the conversation light and warm; rather then an intimidating financial experience that could have been stressful. He laid everything out for us on the line, was very friendly, and honest. After we finished up with the paperwork, we went back to Scott and again, I cannot rave enough about our experience with him. We had a genuine experience that will always be special to us.
