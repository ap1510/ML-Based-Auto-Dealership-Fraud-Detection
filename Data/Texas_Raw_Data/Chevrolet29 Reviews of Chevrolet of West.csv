0,"June 08, 2020","I tried to buy a vehicle on Saturday 6/6. I called I was told yes the vehicle is available. I drive 100 miles and arrive to complete incompetence. The vehicle had been loaned out for the shop, I said ok mistakes happen. Then Monday the young car salesman calls and advised we have the vehicle back let’s get everything going on it. I inquire on the price and the salesman says I’ll work on it. A short time later the GM calls and tells me the vehicle had already been sold a week prior. Apparently he decided to go on vacation for a week and not advise anyone that he had sold the vehicle. This was a waste of time and effort. I wonder why the salesman would tell me the vehicle was returned,. You would the think the people in it would of said hey we are buying this vehicle. I call BS! I would not recommend this dealership to anyone. This reminds of the shady dealers in the early 90’s. ",1.0

19,"October 29, 2017","Brought my 08 truck in for a campaign and thought about an oil change too. Was asked about a tire rotation and said not to worry about it. When I picked up the truck on paperwork the technician wrote that I needed a tire rotation and alignment.. Upon getting home I reviewed this and found out how bad my left front steer tire really was. I am surprised that no one called on it. Do you not suggestive sell ? I know I needed tires but that was bad , very bad ! Y’all are in the business to make money. You all could have called and said hey during the L.O.F we saw that you needed tires and tired at least tried to sell a couple tires and alignment.  This time wasn’t the best service we have had here. ",4.2
20,"October 21, 2017","I was called to schedule bringing my 2017 2500HD Duramax in for some basic issues. Plastic parts failing to remain attached, causing Water penetration and rear seat belt issue. My advisor, Vicky, checked me in quickly after verifying the concerns and even locating one I had not noticed. Parts were needed, ordered and I returned for install/repair. While the dealer seems to service many work trucks, getting to work on a true Cowboy Cadillac seems the technician gets a big smile..",5.0
21,"October 07, 2017","It was an amazing experience from start to finish! Mark Shultz is an outstanding man with incredible salesmanship. He was very cordial and hospitable as well as knowledgeable in regards to the Chevy Malibu 2017 that I eventually bought from him. He really did treat us like family and when I went back to visit with them to get my license plates and sticker, he remembered my name asked me about my family.

25,"August 12, 2017","We had checked several other dealers, but they had limited selection in the model we wanted. We were able to see several and compare colors. We already new that we wanted a loaded Equinox. The dealers we had previously visited only had one. Our experience went quickly, and I feel that we got a good deal. The young man who helped us, Waylon Rhodes, was easy to work with. I would recommend him to everyone . ",5.0
