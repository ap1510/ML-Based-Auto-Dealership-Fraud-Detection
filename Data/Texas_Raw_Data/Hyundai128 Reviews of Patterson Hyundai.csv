1,"May 11, 2020","I took my 2017 Honda CRV in for an oil change and decided I would just ""look"" while waiting. My salesperson Jaquavius Goins works in the Honda department and he tried to keep me in a Honda but I wanted to look at a Hyundai Palisade. I took one look at the vehicle and feel in love! Jaquavius was so understanding to my needs and budget and he didn't try to push anything. He is an amazing sales person and I would recommend him to anyone! Bobby Nunn helped me get the BlueLink setup and showed me all the amazing features in the Palisade. Everyone I spoke with was very helpful and professional. ",5.0
2,"March 22, 2020","This is my fifth Hyundai purchased from Patterson's in Wichita Falls.  I have bought a 2006 Sonata, a 2012 Sonata Limited, a 2015 Tucson Limited, a 2017 Santa Fe Sport, and now a 2020 Tucson Ultimate.

With the exception of the first one, all of the others have been purchased from Bobby Nunn as the salesperson.  I can't complement Bobby and Patterson's enough.  I have always received what I consider a great deal (ample trade in value) a great experience with Bobby and with the finance section.

This time, I told Bobby what I was looking for.  Within a day he had located two options for me to consider.  One car was in McKinney and the other in the Houston area.  He presented the options for me to decide which I wanted.

The buying experience was great.  Thank you Bobby.  The Finance person was open, friendly and seemed to care about me getting the car I wanted.",5.0

5,"December 08, 2019","Even though I bought a Hyundai Kona, I have to give Michael Mason (from the Dodge facility) all the credit for finding the car that I wanted.  Dodge didn't have the type of car I was looking for, but he continued to help me with my search at Patterson's.  He showed me cars at they Hyundai facility (even though he didn't sell Hyundai), in which I did find the Kona!  They didn't have one that had all the features i wanted , so he searched the area until he found one for me.  He had it here and ready for me to pick up in 2 days.  That's customer service!!!  Zack Baker was the salesman at Patterson Hyundai that went over the many features, and helpful with any questions I had.  The overall experience was excellent, and I would recommend Patterson's for anyone looking to purchase a new vehicle!  ",5.0
6,"December 06, 2019","Bobby Nunn of Patterson Hyandai was the most professional car salesman I have ever worked with.  He did not give us the typical high-pressure sales pitch but was honest, open-minded, and ethical.  He went the extra mile and worked the purchasing department to get me the same offer CarMax gave us.  I would totally make the drive from Dallas to Wichita Falls again, just to work with Bobby! ",5.0

Bobby Nunn keeps us coming back for his great personality and knowledge of Hyundai . I send all my family and friends to Bobby first and yes they have bought,,,thank you for a great looking SUV and warranty program. Built to last,,,,,",5.0
9,"October 11, 2019","Chris Emery made buying a car as painless as possible.  Having been married 50 plus years my husband always did the  shopping & dealing (I did the approving).  Due to my husband having a stroke I was left to ""Tackle the Task"".  Chris was readily available by phone and text to answer my questions.  Once I had purchased the car Bobby Nunn fully explained all the ""Bells & Whistles"".

22,"January 31, 2019",This purchase was filled with twists and turns. Ups and Downs but through it all Chris Emery was right there every step of the way. With his help and some hair pulling we got everything worked out. Thanks to all the folks at Patterson's that made this all happen. I know I was a bit difficult because I did a lot of shopping but in the end Chris matched the price I had found online. Do your shopping but in the end give them a chance to work with you to get that best price. They did not let me down and I am sure they will not let you down. Now I am rockin my Lake Blue Hyundai Sonata Limited 2.0T,5.0
23,"January 18, 2019","The Patterson Hyundai car buying experience was simply amazing. We saw the dealership off the highway traveling through Wichita Falls on our way back to Lawton Oklahoma. Although, we showed up late and close to closing the hour, Mr. Bobby Nunn (sales associate extraordinaire) stayed late to show us what the dealership had to offer. Patterson made us an offer we could not pass, and we were more than willing to travel back to Wichita Falls to complete the deal. My wife is extremely satisfied with her 2019 Santafe Limited and you will be extremely satified when chosing the also. See Bobby Nunn, tell him Lawton, ""John passing through on the way to Lawton"" sent you.",5.0
24,"December 21, 2017","The only thing I would care to share aside from what I have already written concerns your trade-in policy.  I was told when I first purchased my Sonata that when I traded it in on another Hyundai, I would get a substantial trade-in bonus or something of that sort.  I was really disappointed, although not really surprised, that I did not experience any such thing when I made the new purchase.  Seems promises are easy to make...but harder to keep.  I'm not sure if I will buy another Hyundai and almost did not this time after learning what I had been told was not true.  Had I asked the question in the beginning, I would not have made the purchase, but after spending time there, I really didn't want that time to be wasted, so I went ahead and made the purchase.  Also, the young lady helping me was really nice and I didn't want to have wasted her time either.",4.0

27,"December 13, 2017",The people here are incredibly friendly and helpful. I appreciated their help when selecting a car as I was a first time buyer and they were not too pushy either. It's definitely a place that I would recommend to others around Wichita Falls.,5.0
28,"December 08, 2017","Mr. Bobby Nunn, the salesman I dealt with in purchasing my new Hyundai Tuscson, is the mosr professional, knowledgeable, customer oriented car salesman I have ever dealt with in my entire lifetime experience.  He is a true asset to Patterson Auto Group, and indirectly, but likewise very importantly, to Hyundai Automotive.  Dr. Roy K. Boutwell",5.0

34,"September 20, 2017","This is my 4th Hyundai that I have bought from Patterson, the last three from Bobby Nunn.  He is so personable, so anxious to make sure that you feel welcome and comfortable with your experience while at the dealership as well as after the sale.  He has sent a Christmas card every year since the 2012 Sonata I bought back in 2011.  Since then I have worked my way from the Sonata to a 2015 Tucson and my new 2017 Santa Fe Sport.  Bear in mind that I live over 100 miles from the Patterson dealership.  My buying experiences through Patterson have been stress free and, yes, even enjoyable.",5.0

I always leave the dealership with a pit in my stomach wondering if I got a good deal or if I was taken to the cleaners.  That did not happen this time.  I drove away from Patterson's Hyundai totally confident that I made a great deal that was fair to both the dealership and myself.  Zackre Baker was extremely helpful.

65,"December 27, 2016","I was in need of a good pre-owned vehicle.  Met Jeffrey Klepper on Monday afternoon, the 26th of December, 2016.  He was exceptionally courteous and friendly to work with.  He answered all of our questions, was patient and worked with us to get the best deal for the amount we could spend.  He explained how Mr Patterson puts people first above sales.  That was a comfort and confidence builder in our approach to buying a used vehicle.  Most dealerships want to just sale you a car, then worry about your needs.  We purchased our leased Honda (leased through a  previous dealership) with Patterson and that was also a great experience.  
Again, this was a great experience and my wife and I were well pleased with the results.  I have never owned a Hyndai, but I am very impressed with the design, handling and condition of the vehicle.  This was all made possible due to the professionalism of Jeffrey.  I will highly recommend those in need of a new or used car to visit Patterson Auto.  If in need of a pre-owned, to work with Jeffrey",5.0

If anyone is considering purchasing a new car, give Cameron Moore at Patterson Auto Center a chance.  I told him exactly which car I wanted right down to the stock number and VIN from their web site, how much I expected for my trade-in, how much money I was willing to put down ($0), and how much I wanted my payments to be.  And he made it happen!  He really does his homework.  He knows the vehicles inside and out.  He went  through every option of every menu on every feature to make sure that I knew how to use them, right down to connecting my phone to the car.  When I went to the finance department, there were no surprises.  I was able to get gap insurance and extended warranty and still be within my budget.  Even 26 days after the sale, whenever I have questions, I text Cameron and he replies very promptly.  He's very personable and easy to talk to.

95,"June 23, 2016","I have put off buying a car because it seemed to be an overwhelming task. However, from the time I talked to Tara and she arranged for me to drive a Santa Fe, I was sold on the safety features. She then introduced me to Andre who made sure I was satisfied that the car I was buying had everything I wanted or needed in a car. The next person I was introduced to was Bobby. He gave me a one-on-one, hands-on demonstration of every feature in the car, answering every question I had and making me feel comfortable that if I thought of another question, I could call him. He made sure I knew how to do the setting and programming of features such as the seat/mirrors, (programmed to fit me before I left the dealership), the phone system (syncing my phone and having me make a call so I would know how that system worked), radio/music (explained the programming of Sirius). I especially appreciated how he explained the safety features. He even made sure my first checkup was programmed in the car and showed me where the service department is. Even the actual purchase of the car and signing of the papers was made very easy and painless by Jayvon. He explained in detail what my options were and, he too, answered all my questions. I am very satisfied with the personal attention each of the four employees gave me.",5.0

97,"May 26, 2016",Cameron Moore was by far the most professional salesperson I have ever come across. I was greeted as soon as I got to the dealership since I had pre-arranged my appointment. I was nervous about looking at vehicles but Cameron reassured me the quality of the vehicles and that he would find exactly what was needed for my lifestyle. He was courteous on asking specific questions on what I was looking for a new vehicle and if I expressed my interest of things I did or didn't like about a particular car he was good to ensure me which models came with the features I was looking for. I even liked that he pointed out features of certain cars that I haven't thought of and you could tell that Cameron had a passion for these impressive features and his career. With negotiating Cameron kept on telling me about his great coworkers that would soon be working with me to finance my car and again reassured me that they would work with me for a good deal. After the finance negotiations were through Cameron even provided a ride to the service department to meet my new service manager and to remind me of the services they provide whenever I may have an issue with the car. I then was delivered my new car and I loved it! The gas tank was full and everything was so nice and clean and Cameron went over the Blue Link feature I had purchased which was a cool addition. The next day Cameron even called me to ask how everything was going (which was still great by the way) and a few days later called again to let me know of a recall on the A/C system for my model and quickly came over with a rental car for me while my car was being fixed on the new updates. The whole staff of Patterson was very welcoming and helpful with a big life decision that I was apprehensive about but was quickly blown away by my amazing experience. I will definitely let people know about my good experience and tell everyone that if they are buying a car that they should go to Cameron Moore!,5.0

102,"April 27, 2016","My wife & I were greeted on our arrival at the dealership by Cameron, the salesman who mailed me his business card.  I had been looking online - comparing cars. I decided that I would possibly be interested in the Genesis. We discussed this during a phone call to Cameron and set a day when my wife & I could come to Wichita Falls, TX for a test drive and possibly discuss a purchase & trade. Cameron was very helpful and informative. We test drove the car. Cameron explained all of the safety features - which is a very impressive list.  We loved the car and the next day we called Cameron back - did a counter offer for purchase and picked up the car that afternoon.  Cameron was very helpful in getting us familiar with all the features.  We are very pleased with the service provided by Cameron and the dealership.",5.0

104,"March 28, 2016","Tyler Cameron was our personal salesperson regarding our new Hyundai Santa Fe.  He was knowledgeable and polite and never once pressured us into making a decision, as it took us over a week to decide whether or not we were going to purchase after much research.  Patterson also let us discuss with outside lenders in order to try and get the best possible financing, but ultimately it was Patterson's financing that gave us the best deal.  The whole car buying experience is usually one that is frowned upon by many due to the pressure put upon families and people feeling as if they are being taken advantage of.  Never once did we feel this way with the Patterson family.  From the moment we stepped onto the lot, the car buying experience was our own and it was just facilitated by Tyler to make sure he got us in the car that suited our needs.  This is the second car we have purchased from Patterson and we are happy to tell anyone who is in need of our positive experiences!",5.0

109,"November 10, 2015","We recently bought a 2015 Hyundai Tucson. Love it!  Tyler Cameron was out salesman and did a more than commendable job through the process.  It took a while, because I was trying to get the right color, style, and price, combined with the usual customer (I have a great trade-in) story. In this case, it was true. However, when I thought, well I have put Tyler to the final test and all the things He was needing to accomplish and getting me the deal I was happy with we still were smiling and laughing at the end. Since then, I have leaned on him 2 or 3 times for help in the service dept. and the finance/warranty dept. with Brady Briggs. Honestly, the entire experience was  good and hopefully you all feel the same way. I honestly believe that you also want thorough and educated customers. This helps customers and the professionals in your store. Thanks.  Larry Barnhardt",4.8

111,"October 27, 2015","My husband and I stopped by Hyundai as our first stop on our car shopping adventure. Tyler Cameron was the first sales person to approach us. I told him the 3 cars I was interested in and he lined them all up (Santa Fe, Genesis and Sonata) for us to test drive. After we were done we walked into the showroom and there it was the Azera. It was love at first sight for me. Tyler gladly had me test drive it. He helped us figure out if three car seats would fit in the backseat. I was sold, never even made it to another car dealership. Tyler was very friendly, helpful and easy to work with. I am loving my new car and so are my boys. Thank you Tyler for making this experience a pleasant one.",5.0
