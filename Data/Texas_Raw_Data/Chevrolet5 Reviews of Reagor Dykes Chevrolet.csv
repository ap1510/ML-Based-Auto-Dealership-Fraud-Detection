3,"August 24, 2017","I was surprised at the inventory that this dealership carries!  After looking around, we found the pickup truck that was just what we wanted!  We showed an interest in this pickup and Xavier Cervera, the salesman that helped us, started working with us on this deal.  He will help one get into the vehicle that they want and Brian Bruce the manager, also helped us with getting the best deal!  Very nice people to trade with.  Personal there are all so friendly and helpful.  So We would highly recommend this dealership to everyone!!! ",5.0
