0,"October 02, 2017","I visited this dealership initially to purchase a BMW,  but found that I liked the Volvo better. The salesman was not pushy nor did he try to guide me toward a certain vehicle. Once all of the paperwork was finalized there was a bit of a wait, but I was offered food and a drink. My overall experience there,  so far has been pretty good. ",4.2
1,"August 21, 2017",I've been impressed with the level of customer service and courtesy. They've been very accommodating and genuinely kind. I'd recommend them to anyone looking for a new Volvo.,5.0
2,"October 06, 2015","Much like the other review, I had an absolutely terrible experience twice now at this dealership, and it as well has to do with the service department.  I brought my vehicle in for a scheduled maintenance, which I called to set up weeks in advance and requested a loaner car/Volvo to drive while my car was being serviced.  The lady on the phone, said that would be fine.  I also informed her that I was having an issue with my seat lumbar control area and that a new housing was needed.  This was discovered when I was in Houston and had to take my Volvo in for a new tire after a blowout.  The service technician at MOMENTUM VOLVO of Houston was absolutely wonderful and informed me of the issue with my lumbar and told me if I were in town for one more day he would have it fixed next day under warranty.

1st Visit Arrival
When I arrived for my first visit to  Garlyn Shelton in Temple, my Volvo loaner was not available, but instead I was given a dirty Mazda that had not been cleaned and had less that 12 miles till empty on the digital gauge.  It took forever to get signed in at the service desk, and the part I requested had not been ordered.  On this visit I also requested that my car get inspected as I had just moved to the area and my inspection was scheduled to go expire.  I explained this to the service clown, and he told me not a problem.  When I returned that evening to pick up my car, the seat was not fixed and I was told I would have to schedule another visit and the part had been ordered, but the did not know when it would come in.  My inspection was also not completed because ""The previous inspection was done in a different county with emissions and we don't have emissions testing here.""  Hello, I just informed you I moved to this county, and my license and insurance are through this county.

2nd Visit
I went to have my seat lumbar installed that I had ordered.  It took me two months to get back to the dealership to get the lumbar housing installed due to the fact that this is a rural area and I travel for work.  When I arrived at the dealership I checked in my car and of course, no loaner vehicle was available.  (I was not surprised).  After about 20 minutes the service advisor informed me they no longer had the part and that they had shipped it back to where they received it from.  He had no desire to help me out what-so-ever.

This dealership has provided not one, but two terrible customer experiences and quite honestly makes me not want to buy a Volvo if I can't get service at the dealership nearest to me.",1.0
3,"March 18, 2015","I am from New Braunfels. I was in Temple for 7 days and thought I had a bad bearing on my rear left side.  I went online at about 3am Monday March 16, 2015 to schedule service for my Volvo. I set up an appt. for Wednesday March 18th at 7:30am. I received 2 emails from Garlyn Shelton Volvo of Temple reminding me of my scheduled appointment.  Since I had an early appointment Wednesday morning, I decided to call on the afternoon of March 17th (Tuesday) see if I could drop my car off that evening. A female named Karen or Taren answered my call. When I told her I had an appointment early the next morning, but wanted to drop my car off after hours, she informed me that I did not have an appointment. She did some searching and then told me that I had picked a tech that no longer worked there. I informed Karen/Taren that I didn't pick a tech because I have no idea who the techs are. She put me on hold and came back on the line to tell me that they couldn't honor my appointment. 
Now I'm stuck driving back to new Braunfels  (a 2 hour drive) with a bearing problem.
I went ahead and made a service appointment with Volvo of San Antonio. Volvo of San Antonio is a real dealership with service people who really care about their customers. 
I have NEVER seen such a poor excuse for service. These folks make shade tree mechanics look great!!!",1.0
