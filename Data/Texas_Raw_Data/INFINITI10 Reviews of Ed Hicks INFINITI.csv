1,"March 11, 2018","Looked here for a deal 3 years ago, and ended up goo g to San Antonio. This time around they made an offer nobody could beat. We have been Ed Hicks customers going on 14 years. Loyalty does have its rewards. And with Nissans, Mercedez, and Infinit to choose from, you have plenty of price range options. Going to return for when I'm ready to get my Q60.",4.6

4,"August 16, 2017","We have purchased several cars through the years and this was by far the best experience ever! Most times we drop of our trade and wait for a call on the value which comes hours later. Then do the finance app and leave while waiting a few more hours for another call etc. Not this time- everything was done quickly and efficiently. Marco and Andrew were the best, and maybe it's because this was our first time purchasing at a luxury dealership, but we never felt like we were being worked over. Our last vehicle was a sticker price not much less than this QX 80, however we were treated like we were getting a $5,000 piece of crap. This experience changes everything-we will only buy from this dealership from now on!",5.0

6,"May 05, 2017","I went into Ed Hicks Infiniti originally looking at the new Q60 coupe and met Andrew. He was extremely knowledgeable on the car, all of its features and Infiniti in general. Not once did he have to look anything up and answered every question confidently and even provided more information that I would have known to ask. From day one there was never any pressure to buy but he did follow up occasionally to see how I was and if I had any additional questions. 

I came back to the dealership one evening and saw the new QX30 and felt like it was a gorgeous car and fell in love with it when I drove it. For a 4cyl turbo I was SHOCKED. I haven't driven anything under a V6 or 6cyl in 15 years and the car was extremely responsive and gave me what I wanted performance wise. 

I decided to go with the QX30 but they didn't have the exact car in the color and package I wanted so they found it for me and got it to the dealership in less than a week. On top of that they gave me a great number on my trade and made this the easiest car buying experience I think I've ever had. I couldn't be happier. 

I'm in love with my car and look forward to working with Ed Hicks Infiniti for many years to come. ",5.0
