0,"June 25, 2020",I recently bought a CPO car from Bob Stallings and was promised features on the car that it doesn't actually have! I contacted the dealership and was talking to a manager who said he would call me back and he never didm and of course I can't get a hold of him now when I call. This is very disappointing and unprofessional. It's clear that Bob Stallings only cares about making a sell and not about taking care of the customer! STAY AWAY!,1.6
1,"November 12, 2019",I complained about a questionable charge and they then refused to repair my car.  Were more concerned with Ratings than customer service.  Customer service manager is shady and more concerned with ratings than customer service.  This is a black eye on the reputation of the dealer and the brand.  Never again!!,1.0
2,"June 02, 2019","Julian Salazar was a great help to my son not only 1 time but 2 times he takes his time with his customers and make sure that you get the BEST. Customer Services means so much to me because I look at the service that is provided. And JULIAN SALAZAR provide just that I am grateful to have met him as my son salesman. I would definitely recommend Julian Salazar. He is Great, Awesome and he gets the job done... Thanks Julian Salazar..",5.0
3,"September 22, 2018","I came there to test drive an Elantra GT one night an hour before closing. I was told before I came that they did price matching as I had found the same vehicle online at another dealership for much less. When I got there I had to wait and was tossed from one salesman to another after my test drive. I was very interested in the vehicle and asked repeatedly their price. They were not up front about it at all. Once I told them the price I found elsewhere online they trash talked the other dealership and I was told there was no way they would actually sell me that car that cheap. I told them I couldn't afford their price but they still kept insisting we could work something out. The salesman said he was unable to give me a true price without pulling my credit. I am very weary of a bunch of unnecessary hard inquiries going onto my credit report. I was then argued with for even longer until I finally told them I had to go and would come back tomorrow. This was only after the finance manager told me he would call me with some numbers the next morning. That didn't happen. I still came back because they kept saying they could get the payment where I needed it to be. This was not true and they knew that all along. The salesman again argued with me and then tried to sell me another vehicle I wasn't interested in. When I asked him the price of this vehicle, he STILL was not upfront about the price. I was very unsatisfied with the customer service I received here and left immediately after. I do not recommend this place. However I did really like the finance manager Ward that talked to me. He was very nice as was the original salesman who took me on my test drive. Be weary if they aren't giving you a solid price for a vehicle and DO NOT let them pull your credit until they've negotiated a deal that will work for you! Don't be bullied by this rude sales guy. His name isn't even on this list but it's something like Mauricio?? The one I liked who took me on the test drive has blue eyes and walks with a limp. Nice guy!! Also like to give a shout-out to Ward for his impeccable fashion sense! ;)",2.8
4,"September 18, 2018",These guys do not respect their customers. When I realized they did not include a mileage discount for the 5400 miles they drove the service loaner I financed - Monday I called after getting it that Friday when my tire is flattened - the Sales assistant threatens to pick up the car after she runs out of lying and insulting me personally. They overcharged every dealer fee in the purchase and had to have me resign everything but refused to do what was right and discount the car additionally as discussed with the Sales man. ,1.0
5,"July 30, 2018","I just have to give credit where credit is due. Special thanks to the magnificent team for coming through once again. I have purchased cars from this dealership in the past for my daughters but this time it was for me and I instantly fell in love with a vehicle that was carefully hand-picked for me. I only saw pictures of the outside of the car initially and I knew it was the one for me. It was delivered to my job with care. And when I got inside I felt as if the team selected this car as if they were selecting it for themselves. It had features that I did not know it had and plus it was my favorite color. I was given clear instructions on how to operate the car and everything. No kidding this is the place to go for your next car. Trust me! Thank you again to Ward, Carrenado and the young lady who's name I didn't catch.",5.0

7,"July 11, 2018","Let me start out by saying that I have purchased 18 cars over the years but have never enjoyed the car buying experience and was not looking forward to this one. I called prior to arrival to inquire about inventory and spoke with Carrenado (Slim) Edwards to give him an idea of what I was looking for. He met my sister and I outside as we arrived and was incredibly  knowledgeable, friendly, efficient, and helpful. He was patient as we discussed the best options for our mother, for whom we were purchasing the car. Slim and the staff were an absolute pleasure to work with and I can’t recommend them highly enough. Thank you for making this purchase an easy and fun experience!",5.0

28,"May 23, 2018","On a whim, I went to a dealership that was way too many miles from my home but I stuck with Bob Stallings because of Courtney. He listened to what I wanted, responded quickly to text and emails, and worked with me until I found what I wanted and within my parameters.

39,"May 04, 2018","I am a few weeks late in posting my review, but it need to be said...Bob Stallings Hyundai always goes above and beyond expectations.  I have purchased four vehicles from them in the past few years.  Each time, the sales representatives and finance personnel have worked extremely hard to get me the very best deal.  My last experience was unique in that my daughter had gone with my wife to get an oil change on my wife's 2017 Tucson.  In casual conversation with staff, she was offered a great deal on a 2017 Tucson as well, trading in her Kia Soul and paying just a few more dollars per month for a bigger, better vehicle.  That same day, Miguel Rodriguez called me and offered to upgrade my 2017 Hyundai SE to a Limited.  I met everyone at the dealership and was introduced to Gary Grace.  My regular salesman Julian Salazar was off that day.  Julian is the man to talk to if you want honesty and a great deal.  That particular deal did not go through due to finances, but Miguel called me the very next day with an even better deal, a 2018 Hyundai Elantra Value Edition.  The family now has three new Hyundais and we are extremely pleased with them!   On a side note, my new vehicle had some minor paint damage and Gary worked diligently to make sure I was completely satisfied with the repairs.  He even delivered a loaner vehicle to my home!",5.0

47,"April 26, 2018","stay away from this dealership. Horrible experience. Took my Hyundai Sonata for them to fix my radio which was not working right in November 2017. Mind you at that time my car and radio was under warranty. Was told they will have to reorder the radio and will call once it is in. Kept calling and was told it was not in yet. Finally was told in March 2018 that they had ordered the wrong radio and had to be sent back. They asked me to come in so they can get the right radio ordered. Went in on Thursday and was told the technicians were off work so should come the next day. Went back the very next day only to be told that the radio is no longer under warranty and will have to pay for it to be replaced.

The customer service was poor all around and no one was willingly to step up and at we messed up and we gonna make this right. Will never buy a car or service from this place again",1.0

71,"January 11, 2018","I just want to take a moment to acknowledge Jazmin and her stellar customer service.  I spent the better part of two hours being given the runaround by Hyundai’s Blue Link customer service team. They told me I could only enroll online. After the online enrollment was unsuccessful, it gave a message that I had to go to the local dealer to enroll. After being on the phone with dealership for 15 minutes, I was told I had to go back the Blue Link’s customer service. I called them back and was told I had go back to the dealer to have the VIN cleared. I called the dealer back and was transferred to the same gentleman I’d just spoken to, who transferred me to Jazmin.  By this time, I was extremely frustrated and discouraged in getting the service.  Jazmin was able to turn my frustration completely around! Jazmin was able to get my service activated and had me on my way in less than 5 minutes. The Bob Stallings dealership has to know that they have an employee that delivered flawless customer service in Jazmin. She truly showed herself to be THE WORLD’S BEST IN CUSTOMER SERVICE!!

79,"November 30, 2017","I called the dealership and inquired about a specific 2018 Genesis Sport. Matthew Merrell (my awesome salesman) said it was just put on the dealership floor two days ago but he'd gladly pull it out, and it was sitting in the parking lot when I arrived. Less than 2 minutes after my arrival we hit the road. TEST DRIVE: most dealerships pressure you into going on their short 2-4 mile numb route where you can't get a true feel for what you want (I've also experienced this at motorcycle dealerships). Matthew had none of that...he simply told me to drive it until I was ready to head back. I was shocked, surprised, and gladly settled into the car. Note: if he or any other salesperson took me on a ""standard"" pre-selected route then I would not have bought the car--period. I informed Matthew that I wanted to hit the highway and a bad bumpy road; he obliged and we took our time. PRICE: Matthew knew my price point and met it without the standard & time consuming ""let me check with my boss"" syndrome. I hate that! OVERALL: this was by far the easiest and fastest car purchase I've ever made, and I'd be dumb not to go to Bob Stallings Genesis first for my next purchase.",5.0

Reached out to them with specific questions and details only to get automated response (from Denisse) and promises of a sales person (Khalu) that would follow up with me. I reminded Denisse that she stated that she would have Khalu and her sales manager follow up with my inquiry. A week later, I received a generic email from Khalu. Didn't even bother to address my pricing inquiry. Customer service and gaining my business was obviously not a priority.  Seems like it should be when there are so many competing dealerships in the metroplex. Most others (even in Round Rock) provided genuine responses within the same day. ",1.2

120,"August 26, 2017","I'd urge anyone thinking of doing business with these guys to use extreme caution.  After a run in with a pole of my carport I was in need of a new driver side side mirror.  I usually get my car serviced at freeman hyundai, but have gotten a little frustrated saying no to them repeatedly on all their upsells they continually push.  I call up bob stallings and get transferred multiple times to multiple people to voice mails and hung up on.  On my third call I finally get in touch with someone that seems to have any clue what they are talking about.  I get quoted south of 400 for parts, labor, and paint for the mirror.  I agree.  This is a Monday.  Guy says the mirror will be in wed and will be painted by Thursday.  Come Friday, I still haven't received a call. I call them, after multiple transfers some guy tells me the mirror is already and I make an appointment.  I get there Tuesday, wait around for over 2 hours and then get told they never painted the mirror, but they did wash my car for me(big fricking deal).  Pissed off, I go home. I come back the following Saturday, spend an hour there and they finally finish the work.  They bill me over 450 for the entirety.  In my experience, when a business messes us they usually offer discounts as opposed to raising prices.   All this hassle,waste of time and money for a silly little side mirror.   I can't imagine doing business with these guys for major car work or for buying a new car.   I will not be coming back.",1.2

Wish I'd have caught that before the papers were signed....would've been a deal breaker for sure. But, that wasn't the dealerships fault, they never told me that it had that feature.

When I asked why, because I just bought the car last april I was told that the 2016 Accent does not come with a spare.  I was dumbfounded.  I would not have bought a car without a spare.  The service guy said that is why you have Roadside Assistance. I am very upset about this.. This is the 5th new car I have bought and all the others came with a new spare.

He is one of the most patient, caring, sweetest salesman I have ever encountered. I literally spent almost 8 hrs at the dealership testing driving cars and going over numbers. Mr Bob Stallings himself even came over to check on me several times.  Ron had to be honest with me about some numbers but he kept pushing and working with and for me. Ron was the absolute best even after my purchase he called to check on me. It's not too often you run into salesmen like that. I understand they have to make quotas and what not but he definitely had a genuine spirit and energy about himself. I most definitely will refer him to everybody. He made my purchase worthwhile!

294,"June 30, 2016","I never owned a Hyundai car before as all the new vehicles purchased in my family were made by Toyota. I was forced to search for a new car to buy when my Toyota Corolla car which I liked very much was rear-ended and totaled by a careless uninsured driver at a stop sign at a road crossing in Dallas, TX.  I chose to buy a new 2016 Hyundai Accent SE after making full payment rather than a Corolla as it was more affordable for me. On returning home with my new car, I was astonished to find that it did not have a spare tire but had a tire repair kit instead. I never expected the car not to have a spare tire as all of the my Toyota Corollas came with a spare tire. When I came to purchase the car at the dealership (Bob Stallings Hyundai, Dallas, TX), I was not told that no spare  tire was provided with the car. Nor was I told how to use the tire repair kit. Even the specifications for the vehicle provided at the dealership does not say that a tire repair kit is provided instead of a spare tire. Later, I came to know that I could get a spare tire by purchasing the same. I feel that having a spare tire is better than having a tire repair kit and I am now forced to order a spare tire which, I understand, will cost me $299 plus taxes. This is additional expenditure for a retired senior citizen particularly as the tire kit cannot be returned. I cannot express my disappointment with the above. Hyundai should have give the option to the customer to get the tire kit or the spare tire.  Sales Associate, Courtney assisted me with the purchase of the car. He was very friendly, helpful and courteous. He did a did a excellent job.",4.6

327,"February 12, 2016","

I purchase a 2011 Hyundai Sonata on 2-5-16 through Lone Star Online. . I found paperwork inside the car stating that the vehicle was purchased at Bob Stalling Hyundai so I called them and asked them about the warranty left on the car. They ask me for the vin and said bring the car in and we can extend the warranty. So I took the car to the dealership on February 9th around 4:30 pm. I get there and they began asking me a lot of questions, how long have you had the car? Where did you buy the car? I began to wonder why they were asking so many questions. So they asked me for my keys and said they had to look at the car to determine if the warranty was still good. So I gave them the keys. They told me they were going to pull my car into the garage. Ten minutes the still car was not in the garage so I asked someone where is my car? No one wanted to answer me. So I go to Marcus Williams the General Manager and I ask where is my car? And he tells me your car is OK we just need some information. Can we please have your license for the warranty. And he began coping down all the information from my license. Then he tells me this car is stolen and you’re not getting it back the police are on their way.

I said sir I have a paid receipt. I also have a clear title from the DMV. So he goes on to tell me the car was sold to a gentleman. His finances supposedly didn't clear. The dealership did not report the car stolen to the police they just filed a claim with their insurance company. While in possession of the car it's towed for being parked illegally. The tow company contacted the registered and legal owner of the car. They follow Texas laws by contacting the registered owner twice with certified mail but no one returned any of their mail. The dealership failed it's legal obligation to place a lien or title hold on the car. They said they just put a bounty hunter out looking for the car… Really?? Wow

The car was never claimed for 3 months. The car became the legal property of the impound due to legal duties and fees. Now having the legal right they sold the car through Lone Star auctioneers a license company. That’s how I purchase the car. With all the legal documents I went to the DMV. The supervisor looked over all the paper work performed a title search. The search revealed clear title, no holds from dealership. The title was issued in my name.

When the police got to the dealership they told me that it is a civil case and they can't do anything about it so they allowed the dealership to steal my car of which I possess legal ownership of and was able to show. They like a con artist deceived me out of my keys, by saying they were going to do a warranty check.
So the law enforcement being of no help, but providing a report leaving me to find a way home
The next day I go back up there with the title in my hand and all the paperwork showing that I own that car. Demanding for my car back. But they would not release the car. They fail to follow the proper steps to show ownership. They never even put a lien on the car or reported it stolen. Bob Stalling Hyundai with deceptive intent stole my car. Now I don't have a car . I had to take days off work to try to fight them to get my car back . I had to rent a car to get back and forth . They have no right to hold my car.

ALSO I HAVE ALL THE DOCUMENT FROM THE TOW COMPANY AND AUCTION SHOWING EVERYONE ON THE TITLE WAS NOTIFY.  STILL  WONT RELEASE THE CAR.. ",1.0

The entire staff was friendly and did not hesitate to ensure my daughter and I were comfortable throughout the visit. The restrooms were very clean!",5.0
337,"January 18, 2016","'ve purchased 2 vehicles from Bob Stallings, both used - a 2014 Dodge 1500 Ram, and a 2013 Equus - in the last 3 months. My salesman was Ron Payne.
Let me first start with my last 2 experiences purchasing vehicles. I bought an SUV from Mac Churchill Acura in Ft. Worth. My wife and I went out to look at the vehicle after doing a ton of research on the internet, and finally choosing the one at Mac Churchill. We went out there, a 45 minute drive for us, and then had to go to the Bedford location to test drive the vehicle because they had incorrectly listed to location. My wife loved the SUV and we told them we were ready to buy. We negotiated a price. Since Mac Churchill had just received the vehicle they had to clean it and go through it before it would be ready, and they asked us to come out the next day - a Saturday. On Saturday we went back out, and the first thing they did was try to change the price we negotiated. Also, the vehicle had still not been cleaned or gone through. In the end, it took us starting to walk out of the dealership for them to come back to the price we negotiated. We were also there for nearly 5hrs before we drove off the lot. It was one of the most ridiculous experiences we ever had. After a couple of weeks we noticed several things on the SUV that they did not do, and they wouldn't take care of any of those issues. Nothing is ever going to be perfect when buying a car, but it would have been nice if they had made an effort to correct issues we had. And 5hrs to buy a car when you're giving $25k cash down on a $35k vehicle is insane. They didn't even start the detailing of the car until 3hrs into it, and they never offered us a drink, or to bring the car to us, or anything.
Another similar experience was had with Bonham Chrysler. Terrible experience with the salesman just wears you out. The car did not come complete - missing a key fob, no spare tire, no floor mats - and they wanted full price for it. They were absolutely unwilling to negotiate on that. I was in the unfortunate position of having a friend drive me the 1hr it took to get there, and also after 175k miles, having just blown the head gasket in my sports car. On a positive note, when I decided to make the purchase, it was only about 2.5hrs to get it, and get out. They also gave me something to eat while I waited - pizza. One thing that really gets me is that Bonham puts you on an email list and the emails never stop. They don't even give you a link to unsubscribe.
So this is the low bar that was set when I first walked into Bob Stallings Hyundai. I was dreading having to deal with another car dealership. When I went in it was raining heavily! My son and I were met by Ron Payne, a salesman. He greeted us warmly, and offered to let us test drive the truck in pouring rain, even running out and bringing it under the canopy so we wouldn't get wet. We discussed price, and I gave him an ""all-in"" number that I had to hit for the deal to get done. It was a little back and forth, but after just a short time we agreed on a price. I was happy, and the dealership was happy. In all I was there about 2hrs and everything was complete, and I owned the truck. Ron also wanted to do a few things to the truck (fill the tank, etc), but I couldn't wait so he offered to drive the truck to my house the next day!! That's no small thing since I live in Frisco - 40 minutes from the dealership. This truck, a 2014 Ram with 29k miles is like a brand new truck. Bob Stallings did an amazing job making sure this truck was in like-new condition. Nothing missing, and not a scratch on it. We love it!!!
Given this positive experience I told Ron that at the end of 2015 I want to trade in my Genesis for an Equus. Not a brand new Equus, but used. I gave Ron the parameters, max mileage, year, signature edition, etc. This gave Ron 2 months to get the car in the dealership. Just before Christmas Ron sent me pictures of an Equus and asked if it would work. Once I gave the approval they made it happen. Bob Stallings Hyundai bought the car at an auction, got it to their dealership and then made it like brand new!! I'm not kidding. They put brand new tires on the car, took out a couple of door dings, cleaned it out, made sure everything was there and working, and it is literally like brand new. And again, I was in and out in 2 hrs, and that included them having to look at my Genesis trade-in.
Nothing ever goes perfect, and this was not different. There was a bit of a misunderstanding of the price, that caused me to hesitate, but the dealership made it right, and they were quick about it. Also, one of the key fobs was lost, but they are coming to my work to bring me a new one, and to get it programmed.

358,"November 17, 2015","Bob Stallings Hyundai has consistently fallen below expectations
I bought  a pre-owned Hyundai Equus from them. I saw the car online. I was traveling from out of state to pick the car up. I was in discussion with them for at least two weeks prior to my arrival at the dealership.
I sent the dealership a checklist at least a week before my arrival 
They assured me that the car  had all items included on my checklist
I gave them my flight arrival time etc
When I got to the dealership the car didnt have several items that they had promised me 
I waited for more than 3 hours for them to try to get things together
One of the items...the tire condition...was far below expectation based on they had told me
I bought new tires as I had to drive the car home( 900 miles) .
Had this been the only issue I could have gotten past it. However..it just kept piling up
 They promised me reimbursement for the missing owner's manuals that were to be part of the deal as well
I have had the car in my possession two weeks now and they have yet to reimburse me...and have said the "" check is in the mail"". It hasnt been
I have had the owner's manuals( that I purchased on my own) for more than a week now
The manuals took 6 days to get to me after I paid for them.....and still a week after all this Bob Stallings has not sent my reimbursement
Futhermore...they made a mistake on  the sales contract . I found out yesterday....two weeks after I had taken possession of the car. They put the wrong year on the contract and therefore it has to be recreated and resigned again.
I called my local BMV earlier this week to try to register the car and was told that they have no records of a sale of  a car to me from this dealer ship
Based on what my local BMV told me..it really doesnt seem that difficult to send information electronically to another state for a change of title
They have redone the agreement( and included the reimbursement check) and I was told yesterday that it would be sent over night for delivery today
Well...UPS says a label was created but that the package had yet to be dropped off to them.
I guess I should not have expected that anything they said was actually going to be accurate.

Other dealers sell cars to people in other states all the time..I personally have purchased 3 cars out of state. I have never had a issue the prior 3 times
I have called ( and emailed) the dealership multiple times. Most often this ends in no response.
The few people that I have talked to seem to have good intentions...but still nothing is resolved.

I am a business professional that is accustomed to checklists, organization and deadlines.

I guess my expectations of professionalism are too high...in this case anyway
Unfortunately..I am still left to fight through this situation to get resolution",1.8

360,"November 12, 2015","I normally don’t take the time to write reviews, but I had to do one for Bob Stalling Hyundai because my car-buying expectations were met and surpassed with this dealership. I purchased a 2016 Sonata Hybrid.  They were the most accommodating dealer I have ever worked with.  The dealership was nice, new, and the entire staff was friendly, accommodating, and extremely professional.  The associates did not pressure me in the slightest bit to make a deal and easily offered me the best deal of any of the Hyundai dealerships in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex.  I would also like to acknowledge Ron Payne who was my sales associate.   He was knowledgable about every Hyundai vehicle in their inventory and he called me several times after the sale
 to ensure I did not have any issues with the vehicle and to ensure that I was satisfied with the purchase.  I would highly recommend buying a Hyundai from Bob Stallings.

397,"May 31, 2015","We had been looking at cars for a little bit after a car accident. We had been to several dealerships including some other Hyundai dealers in DFW.  The experience at Bob Stallings was different.  We were promptly greeted by Miguel Rodriguez shortly after we got out of our car and he whisked us off to go preview vehicles.  We had a pretty good idea what we liked when we arrived and Miguel did an excellent job delivering vehicles that met those criteria.   In fact, we arrived shortly  before 5pm and had finalized a purchase by 730pm.    It was efficient and relaxed.  No pressure but he delivered.  We highly recommend this dealership.",5.0
398,"May 29, 2015","I found a great deal on a slightly used Elantra and contacted Bob Stallings to arrange a time to come check the vehicle out. Everything went fine, a sales person named Carrenado contacted me, and a manager contacted me (I believe his name was Gary Lindy). In the process of emailing them both, they offered to drop the price a few hundred dollars on the car.

I came in to see the car, wound up liking it and buying it, though in the process of filling out the paperwork Carrenado had to re-print several documents as he presented the wrong ones (his words). As I was test driving this particular car, I noticed the fuel was low and asked if they would include a full tank of gas if I purchased the car. Carrenado told me the tank would be ""topped off"".

When I had questions about how the warranty would work with a certified pre-owned vehicle, Carrenado kept stating the 10 year/100,000 mile warranty would begin at the point at which I buy this car. My boyfriend and I asked him for something in writing which backed up what he was telling us, as the only warranty documentation we could find stated the 10yr/100k mile started at ""0"" on the odometer. Carrenado continuously stated he was unable to provide any documentation, but kept repeating himself that the 10yr/100k mile would begin at the point I purchased the car. He even demonstrated by pointing out the current mileage of the car on an invoice, and telling me to add 100,000 miles to the mileage listed on the invoice because that's how long my warranty would be good for.

At this point I was getting skeptical and stepped outside to discuss things with my boyfriend. I also reached out to a Hyundai salesperson I'd worked with at another dealership, and that other salesperson told me the information Carrenado was giving me was 100% false.

When my boyfriend and I stepped back inside, the manager I'd emailed with previously came over and told us the 10yr/100k mile warranty started at ""0"" miles on the odometer. This means Carrenado was either mistaken, or was deliberately lying, neither of which was reassuring, and he never apologized for providing incorrect information.

The rest of the process went decently well, until I got the car. The tank was not full, it was close and we're talking maybe a $3 difference between how high the dealership had filled the tank, but I should not have been told I would be given a full tank of gas if they had no intention of actually filling it. Also, the detailing work was done very sloppily. There was film and cleaning chemical residue left all over the interior of the car, they obviously were in a rush when they cleaned the interior.

The second business day after purchasing the car, I emailed Carrenado to ask if they had received the check for the car from the bank. No response. Several days later, I emailed the manager Mr. Gary and asked him the same question regarding the check. Again, no reply.

It's now been several weeks and I've yet to receive any documentation regarding the title or my registration, so I called the dealership on Wednesday and spoke to the receptionist. She transferred me to the woman who handles titles at Bob Stallings, and I left her a message. I just called back again today (Friday) and left another message for the same woman.

All in all, this was a mediocre experience at best. People at the dealership are consistently friendly, though on several occasions the information I've been provided was either erroneous or intentionally misleading. The warranty ""confusion"", the gasoline not being full, and the lack of communication from the dealership have all soured the experience for me.

I've also noticed the car is now idling rough at times, so rough a very noticeable vibration can be felt through the pedals and through the steering wheel. I've already dropped the car off at a local Hyundai dealership to have it serviced, and was told the engine mounts would need to be replaced. Something like that should have been found and addressed during the certification process.

Ultimately, the experience was so so. I got a great deal on the car itself, and the staff at this dealership is friendly. The information I got was not always correct, not every promise was kept, and communication after I purchased the car has been completely non-existent.",3.2

Jose was understanding and told me whenever I was ready they would be here. what touched my heart was that Jose actually called me to give me his condolences and to see how I was doing not to sale me a car. that was very kind so when I was ready I came right back to him and him and his entire team did everything they possibly could to get me into a car because I do not have the beat of credit and they went above and beyond what you would expect from dealers who are dealing with someone with less than perfect credit. I truly appreciate them and will send everybody o know here and I know I will be coming back to them for years to come. Luis was awesome and rolled out the red carpet also. did I mention I wasn't in there all day either. thank you so much Jose and Luis ,5.0
402,"April 06, 2015","I have purchased several vehicles from dealerships around the metroplex, and this was by far the most efficient and pleasant buying experience that I have had.  I reached out to every Hyundai dealership within 50 miles of me via email asking for the best deal that they could offer me on a Hyundai Sonata Hybrid, and working with Thomas Weir at Bob Stallings Hyundai was by far the best choice!  Not only did he give me his absolute best price immediately, but he was also willing and able to answer every question that I had very quickly and easily via email so that I could make my purchase within 24 hours as I desired without having to drive all over the place.  The car itself was also more than $1,500 less expensive than anyone else could offer it to me and no one was able to match their price!  All of the communication prior to my trip to pick up the car took less than 30 minutes to an hour including all of the emails and calls.

The next day, I drove to Bob Stallings Hyundai and met Thomas.  He showed me the car and walked me through the initial financing steps.  At one point when he was given the lender options and interest rates, he turned around halfway down the hall and walked back.  When I asked him what happened, he showed me what they had given him and then gave me what he went to get when he went back.  It was difference of 2% on my loan without me having to get involved at all.

The next step was meeting with Miguel Rodriguez, their finance manager to finalize the paperwork.  Miguel walked me through the warranty options, and since I drive an ungodly number of miles every year I selected the warranty and extended warranty.  He was very honest and straightforward about what all of Hyundai's options were and how all of the warranties worked.  I truly appreciated his approach and clear, open communication.

When I finished with Miguel, Thomas was waiting for me with my car.  I was driving a rental, and even though he had an appointment soon, he was even willing to drive my car to the Enterprise location that was nearby, topping off the tank along the way while I returned my rental.  Before leaving the dealership though, Bob Stallings came out to introduce himself and ask me how everything went.  I expressed by sincere appreciation for how smoothly everything went from the email price discussions with Thomas to my interactions with his fantastic finance manager.  Much to my surprise, he then told Thomas to email me in writing that they are giving me my first full year of service for free!  I had already received 4 free oil changes in the purchase, but this was beyond icing on the cake.  The entire process took less than 2 hours all said and done.

This review is a bit overdue since I bought my car at the end of February in 2014, but I can honestly say that from the moment that I began working with Bob Stallings Hyundai to today, I have not had even a moment of buyer's remorse.  I love my car, and I loved every aspect of the buying experience.  I have sent everyone who has mentioned needing a car to their dealership and even had one of my coworkers buy a Sonata from them as well even though she lives on the other side of town.  I personally was more than willing to drive the 45 minutes it took me to get there and would highly recommend them to anyone looking to buy a car online or in person.  I may even head down there to help someone who is looking for a Tucson later today!

406,"February 08, 2015","I have been searching for a new car since Sept of 2014. I have gone to lots of dealerships and worked with lots of different sales people. It has been so disappointing to me to see the lack of honesty that most dealerships have. I was almost about to give up on buying a new car and just continue driving my old one because it was getting so time consuming and very frustrating. Dealerships would tell me a price and when I got there it would be a different price because they added incentive in that they knew I did not qualify for or they would not have the car I called about etc.... Then I called Bob Stallings and I started working with Amy and she was absolutely amazing!! When I got there she had the car we had talked about on the phone and the price of the car was what we discussed.   Then we went to the finance department and worked with Luis and he was amazing as well. He worked numbers out to were it was affordable for me and I even ended up being able to get a warranty. I will tell everyone I know about this dealership and what great customer service they have and most importantly their honest. In this day and age this is something very hard to find when your a customer trying to buy a car. So I would like to say a HUGE thank you to Amy, Luis, and Miguel for making my car buying experience at Bob Stallings an exciting and memorable one.

409,"November 05, 2014","If you are EXHAUSTED with the car buying process, save yourself some time and a LOT of effort.  Just go to Bob Stallings Hyundai!  I drove past a lot of other Hyundai dealerships in order to go see Roger and Jazmin Ayala.  It was well worth it!  I had been in contact with them by e-mail, and I found that they seemed genuine and helpful.  A lot of other car places will send out generic, pre-typed out responses to people.  However, Roger and Jazmin took the time to answer my questions and really get to know what it was that I was looking for.  I could tell that they really wanted to help.  

I was in a situation where the used car that I had bought about a year ago was having a lot of trouble.  I wanted to sell it, but I had quite a bit of negative equity because of an extended warranty I bought.  I was concerned that I wasn't going to be able to buy a more reliable vehicle in my current predicament.  As a single dad with 3 kids, I just couldn't keep breaking down, though!  

My experience at Bob Stalling was great from the start.  First, the dealership is beautiful and kept very clean.  I went on a Saturday, and the employees were grilling hamburgers and hot dogs for everyone.  This was a great treat for my kids and I!  The car that I had been most interested in was there and ready for me to look at.  It was everything I hoped it would be.  I ended up working with Roger, Jazmin, and also Julian Salazar.  (My kids called him ""King Julian"" from the movie Madagascar).  Buying my new Hyundai Elantra was a smooth, easy process without a lot of haggling or ""game playing"".  These people make statements and then stick to their word!  I can also tell you that it was SUCH a huge blessing to be able to get into a reliable vehicle that I won't have to worry about breaking down all the time!  The team was able to roll in all of my negative equity which isn't always ideal, but in this case was necessary.  

As I spent some time in the dealership, I was greeted by a man in a suit who was walking around and saying hello to people.  It turned out that it was Mr. Stallings himself!  I found it highly impressive that the owner of the dealership was taking the time to come out and meet all of the people in his store!  He even spent time with my kids and really made them feel welcome.  Mr. Stallings is old-fashioned when it comes to customer service - he does it the right way!!  When you meet him, you'll see what I mean.  He even has an ethics and mission statement printed up on cards for all of his visitors to be able to see exactly how he does business.  It was fantastic!  

To wrap up...I got the car.  It is gorgeous, and has even more features than I expected to be able to get.  Roger, Jazmin, and Julian have kept in contact with me, checked on me, and invited me to special events that the dealership hosts.  I really feel like part of the ""family"" now.  I am looking forward to getting back out there and seeing everyone again!  I had to drive 45 minutes to go to Bob Stallings Hyundai, but I am VERY glad that I did!

413,"September 28, 2014","The service and care I received from the time I drove up and was greeted by name from Eleazer Elizondo was outstanding. I was given a ride home while my car was being serviced and Danny the shuttle driver, was very nice, polite and very courteous. He made sure I was inside of my home before he left. When my car was finished Danny came back to get me and again, the service was just outstanding!  Eleazer informed me of the services I received that day and also instructed me on the proper maintenance of my vehicle.  I received an extra bonus when they washed my car! Eleazer is going to schedule me an appointment to get my steering wheel fixed but overall this service just kept peeking and elevating higher and higher, I definitely experienced what customer service used to be like. I could tell Bob Stallings places a great  emphasis on excellence and customer service. Each employee I mentioned, had those same values. Great Job!!!!!!!

416,"September 23, 2014","My husband and I spent a few days shopping for a preowned hyundai sonata.  After visiting several dealerships we ended up coming back to Bob Stallings Hyundai to make our purchase.  We had exemplary customer service. Our salesman, Julian, was great to work with and was patient enough to answer every possible question my husband had (and there were many!).  He showed my husband the ways that you can determine if a car has had any accident damage in the past (even if the car fax might indicate otherwise).  We went on a couple of test drives, and after the purchase he took the time to pair my phone to the car.  
Everyone on the staff was very friendly and helpful.  Overall our buying experience was one that ended with complete satisfaction and I'm extremely pleased with my new preowned 2014 Sonata!  I'm sure we'll be back for any future car purchases!

417,"September 21, 2014","My wife and I purchased a 2012 Ford Focus in July after wrecking our Caravan the day after the 4th of July. It was a very stressful time for us having to scramble into another vehicle so quickly. They worked a wonderful deal for us and with poor credit were able to get us financed with a good rating. We were so happy as we were leaving I mentioned I would be back soon to buy a Hyundai Sonata. Yesterday the 20th of September I drove off the lot with the first 2015 Hyundai Sonata. They were just delivered this past week at the dealer and I got the first purchase. I am beyond happy with the way I was treated by the Dealership. They worked a fair price and the rate I got was 9.3% with poor credit. I did have to put down allot to get it but I was prepared to do it. I was not leaving without my car, period! I have been picturing myself driving this vehicle in my mind for sometime. I met Bob Stallings himself at the dealer and was so very impressed as to how CARING and HONEST he is. His staff try so very hard to make you feel comfortable relaxed and informed. It was quite amusing when I told them of my down payment amount Billy Gibson my salesman ran all over the dealership like the UBS guy from MADD TV. the GM Marcus was able to help me get the Sonata that fit me best and Billy showed me all the features that the car had and was so helpful the first time is the main reason I came back and will refer anyone looking for a car. Sure there are other Hyundai dealers out there in the metroplex but why would you want to go somewhere else for such a premium product. How many Thank you's  I just can not say to all of you there at Bob Stallings Hyundai. This is my very first new car since I have been driving and I know without a doubt it was worth it. ",4.6
418,"September 15, 2014","This is my second new car  purchase at Hyundai. Awesome customer service from start to finish. Julian Salazar was professional and yet easy to talk to.

419,"September 15, 2014","I needed an affordable used car for graduate school. I looked down in Austin, while my mom looked around in Dallas. She contacted LaTasha at Bob Stallings Hyundai. Much later, when a nice 2007 Accord came in, Tasha immediately emailed my mom. I drove up the next day and purchased the car, which was marked down at a great value. Bob and Tasha treated me and my mother with the greatest respect and provided amazing customer service. I would definitely recommend them to anybody looking for a car, new or used.",5.0

Although there was only two on the lot that fir my description...The Staff was really Great.
First I was greeted by Internet Manger Emily Sides. She asked if I needed any assistance and then made sure that I was introduced to Roger. He listened carefully to what I asked to look at and was very patient with me as I looked at every car on the lot. There was then another young lady Jazmin that assisted me. She was also very Good. She, Roger, Emily, and Kirby all were instrumental in me Driving home in my Pre-Owned Yukon SLT. When I was ready to walk away, Roger caught me in the Parking lot and resold the Value of the Vehicle, and the Offer I had made. All in All I was pleased with the Staff. Now give me at least a week to Reflect on the Vehicle I purchased. Honorable Mention to Luis Arteaga . who had to do the Dirty work at closing time and stay late doing my Paperwork. The Surprise was when I left everyone else was still outside to wave as i drove away in the Rain. Thanks Guys!",5.0

422,"September 09, 2014","I might have been one of these other people, posting good stuff on this dealership. Unfortunately, one of my few experiences with the people here has turned sour very quickly. You see, I had previously purchased a vehicle with the dealership when it was known as ""South Dallas Hyundai,"" under ownership of Nicholas Parks. It was a very bad experience. This guy absolutely cheated me! He sold me a ""certified"" vehicle that fell apart in a multitude of ways just after getting it off of the lot. I have tried to work with the guy to get the vehicle up to spec. He sent me a letter to “cease and desist.” I have since requested compensation for my time and other damages, but my request has been totally ignored, and now I am forced to sue.

So I called the new management a few months ago and asked for my ""file"" - any documents pertaining to my vehicle. I was told that I would have to drive the hour or so to pick them up personally - there was no other way that these would be sent to me. Well, now it's been a few months, and I have to start moving. I called again last week to check again if there would be another way to verify my identity and process my request for those documents. I spoke once with General Manager Marcus, who had an attitude from the moment he picked up the phone. It has only been xxxx and headache since that moment. This new owner and management - to my great surprise - have chosen to align themselves with fraudster Nicholas Parks! Marcus promised to look into my request and call back. He never did. He has repeatedly ignored my calls and requests with the front desk for call back. I finally had to turn to corporate, Regional Consumer Affairs Manager Erik Saban. He was kind enough to call the dealership and request those documents on my behalf.

I received a call this morning from some young lady at Bob Stallings Auto Group. She turned out to be a witch in the end. I cannot remember her name - I believe it was something like Lindsey Stuart. Unfortunately, when I tried to call back just to get her name for this review, she told started ranting about all kinds of legal and criminal repercussions if I EVER called her again. And this kind of comment has defined our communication. Ms. Stuart told me this morning that the dealership would not be providing any documents on my car. She said that they did not want to get involved in my dispute with previous owner Nicholas Parks. The truth is that they appear to be in cahoots with the fraudster, defending him even now.

The second call that I made to Ms. Stuart - the same one in which she threatened all kinds of repercussions should I ever call her again - she also made other threats. I had already mentioned to Ms. Stuart that I would be writing reviews on their behavior in this incident. This time Ms. Stuart threatened that her lawyer would be calling me if I wrote any reviews. SHE IS TRYING TO SCARE ME INTO NOT INFORMING MY FELLOW PUBLIC OF THEIR FRAUDULENT BEHAVIOR! I told Ms. Stuart that she was missing one key element to defamation and libel claims - falsity! But everything that I am writing is TRUE! Anti-SLAAP laws were created for exactly this kind of behavior, wanton threats by big-money companies against little guys who try to warn fellow consumers!

I cannot believe it. Nicholas Parks was a scammer. He cheated me badly. Never did I imagine that this new dealership would consist of the same kind of low-lifes. You readers can make your own decisions and shop where you want. I would avoid this one as if your life depended on it - because it does! These people are threatening me and trying to rob from me my Constitutional rights to free speech, all to protect their “good” names. Unfortunately, I would not be overly surprised if they follow through on their heinous threats. By the way, Erik Saban has stopped taking my calls. The regional office has been great throughout this process, but I can see the growing taint of this loathsome dealership in South Dallas. Like I said, I am not positive on the name, but I know that this lady called me from (469) 774-7330, if anyone wishes to investigate these allegations.",1.0
423,"September 07, 2014","After two weeks of purchasing my vehicle, I write this review. Had to make sure it was not the excitement of a new vehicle, that led me to write a good review. I will tell you, from the time I met LaTasha, to the time, I met Kirby, & last but not least, Ward at the final signing, it  was an awesome experience!!! There was no pressure, this team knew what I wanted, knew that I would settle for less, but yet did not let that happen. They provided options to let me drive away with the car I picked online, of course I had to do my part as well. This particular team mentioned above, was very proffessional, reassurring, & answered all of my questions. I would recommend & challenge anyone to share my experience!!!!!

I was extremely nervous and anxious when I arrived, but the quiet, pleasant atmosphere and the professionalism of the staff was calming and reassuring.  Salesman, CARRENADO EDWARDS was absolutely wonderful.  He was patient with me and never made me feel pressured or rushed to make a decision.  It wasat least 100 degrees and he brought me three different cars to consider and I never walked the lot.  He sincerely considered my needs and wants.  He definitely showed me customer satisfaction was more than important then selling a car.  Just when I thought it could not get any better, I met with WARD JONES in Finance.  Ward did not intimidate me with a stack of documents at one time.  He took his time and printed one document at a time and explained each document clearly...even drew a little diagram for me :).
