9,"February 13, 2020","When compared to Hou N, Grapevine, and San Juan RR-J service groups, Hou SW service falls short. 

I bought my first Jag here in 2015. I have 3 now. The dealership’s buyer has an amazing knack for finding the sexiest versions of each model the stock - and all are well equipped - this makes buying a car from them really fun. 

The service advisors are friendly and work to please. This time, mine was Daniel, and he was responsive and professional. 

The loaner program representative was also efficient and polite. I’ve shared with all the dealerships I mentioned earlier that Jaguar could improve customer satisfaction by not only going over the loaner car’s condition with the customer, but ALSO doing the same checks on the CUSTOMER’s vehicle to assure any damage is pre-identified.  This practice would improve the customer’s perception that the dealership’s focus is diligent in the care of their customer’s car. 

This particular visit (Feb 2020) got off on a bad start though by the inattentive service door receptionist. In the two hours I sat in the lobby, she spent >60% of her time visiting & flirting with male employees and texting on her phone rather than assisting customers wandering by her station the lobby near the service door. 

My service visit ended and I left, only to realize the unchecked, uncalibrated tire pressure monitors in the shop resulted in wide variance between tires and exorbitant pressure for one of my new $500/ea low profile tires. I left the dealership & noticed by my own car’s pressure monitors that the pressures on all 4 were widely varied from one to the next. The recommended pressure is 37, but all of them were >40 and one of them had been filled to 44! The next day I contacted Daniel, sending pics of my dashboard indicator.  He apologized, told me he would notify the mechanic so he could recalibrate his gauges, and he provided the correct pressure settings so I could remedy the problem on my own.  It bothers me though, that the service tech was unaware that his equipment in the shop is not maintained to this degree, and didn’t take 30 seconds to double check the car’s own  indicator system when he pulled my vehicle out of the garage bay to release it to the service advisor. 

I realize these are small problems, but they erode customer confidence by indicating sub-standard quality and precision within the daily service Dept activities at this location - and I haven’t experienced these sorts of oversight issues at the other dealerships I mentioned. 

I appreciated the positive aspects of my visit and Daniel’s professionalism in his interaction with me.

13,"September 24, 2019","Stay far away from Momentum Jaguar, Land Rover, Porsche, BMW located at 10150 SW Fwy Houston, TX 77074 .  They do not stand behind the vehicles they sell.  Once they sell you the vehicle, and you still have paper tags and drove less than 200 miles, and get a check engine light that's related to the fuel pump - they will not stand by your side.  They will hide and say that's your problem not ours.  Sales guys are clueless as to what they are selling and Sales Managers have no idea how to take care of a customer.  They refuse to even diagnose the vehicle they sold you 2 weeks prior because it's a waste of there time.  Sad and pitiful.  Happy to share the cost and breakdown of the repairs for those that want to know.  ",1.0
14,"July 29, 2019",After being told I was receiving a loaner for my vehicles service I received an email saying I’d be taking a shuttle. Even though I had bought 4 vehicles from this dealership (2 of them Porsches) I was denied a loaner. I was told that my service didn’t qualify for a loaner. I also deal with Sewell Audi which gives you a loaner for any service. They get it. This dealership is highly disappointing.  ,1.3

and on Friday 12/7/18 was told by sales rep Andrew boreham that the vehicle would be ready when I arrived after 1:00pm on 11/7/18, My family and myself traveled 45 minutes to momentum jaguar on time as scheduled but when we arrived Andrew Boreham told us that the vehicle was in the back of the building but couldn't be found, after over 2 hour wait I was told by Andrew boreham that the vehicle that I had purchased was on the way to Florida and ""Sorry have a nice day""  so I had to contact my credit union and cancel all sale because the vehicle wasn't even there, we wasnt even given an explanation or an apology from the Sales Manager ",1.0
18,"October 02, 2018","I sent an inquiry on a 2018 Land Rover that I wanted to surprise my wife with.  I received an immediate phone call from Kendel Jackson(funny his name is like the wine).  I told him exactly what I was looking for and they happened to have it in stock.  When I arrived later in the evening, Kendel had the car sat aside, and ready for an immediate drive, no waiting.  This is my 4th Range Rover purchase in the past three years, so I was fairly familiar with them, yet he was able to show me a few things I had no idea about.  Finished the deal, went to finance, which I wasn't too impressed with.  I am a 820 credit rating, and the best rate they could offer was 4%.  I ended putting a deposit on the car to hold it overnight while I got financing setup through my credit union.  Other than finance, it was my best purchase.  See you in 12 months!!",5.0
19,"September 27, 2018","Don’t go to this dealer — I paid for minor service after taking an early flight back to Houston.  

After being told their “computer system” that keeps all keys in a locked drawer was “down” I waited 30 minutes (after paying) and eventually took Uber to pick up my kid at school.  No manual override key, they said.

Matt — my service guy — was fine — not his fault his bosses put in a stupid and ineffective key system.

It would be comical if it wasn’t so pathetic — I’d taken an early flight back to pick up my kid and was late picking him up.  Not first underwhelming experience at this dealer  — go to Motorcars Ltd in Houston for service and/or repairs in all Rovers and ask for Mike.",1.6
20,"September 19, 2018","Making an appointment by phone with the appointment desk continues to be an absolute nightmare. I have a jag and this marks the third time that I've made an appointment for service and had the same awful experience.  My check engine light came on two days ago, so I immediately called to make an appointment and was told someone would call me back to try to get me in soon since I'm worried about continuing to drive the car under the circumstances.  No one ever called.  I called back and was disconnected twice before finally talking to someone at the appointment desk who scheduled my service for next week (6 days away) even after learning that my check engine light is on.  No advise, no warnings, no consultation - I just need to continue to drive around for 6 days with my check engine light on before Momentum will service my jag.  That's ridiculous!  My husband has a Toyota and he warned me about Jaguar's service.",2.3
21,"September 11, 2018","The sale staff was great but once I got to financing and closing out the deal, all fail apart.
After spending most of the day in the showroom, They advise my credit score was lower than I have.  To eliminated the agruement, I decided to pay in cash with a personal check which manager and finance refused.  Then I was advised it was cooperate policy on checks. The floor manager then advised me if I could demenstrate that I had money in bank he would take the check. I was offended by the approach, a message of a potential thief and lier when he could have call the bank without questioning me if I had funds. Plus what happened to the corporate policy. It's seems it's all a judgement call and not a policy and offensive in they way they decide to take the check or not.  He actually want me to show him my back account balance on bank app which I refused his request and the vechicle.  Bought the same vechicle from.Houston Central, who provided great professional services. Enjoying my new Jaguar.",1.8

27,"December 14, 2017","Terrible experience with this company. Bought pre-owned car for cash after promised they have title in hand. Now, almost two months later, still waiting on title and getting complete run around. Do not return calls. They have my money...",1.0
28,"November 25, 2017","I wasn't really planning on buying a Volvo, but I happened to check Momentum's web site on a Saturday morning and they had an R-design S60 on sale for $11,000 below list. Now, it was a year old 2016 model but still technically new. I couldn't believe the deal so I stopped by to check it out. The car was already out in front of the dealership when I arrived, though I hadn't called or anything. Michelle met me when I walked in and told me if the car was out front, it was probably sold. It wasn't; it has been taken out front because someone else had an appointment to look at it a few hours later, but it wasn't spoken for yet. So, I got to take it for a spin.

Michelle was friendly and knowledgeable and put on no pressure whatsoever. I drove it and decided to buy, which was a slight problem because I hadn't brought my checkbook for a down payment or the second set of keys to my car, which I traded in. Michelle got with the finance department and they quickly worked up a loan quote through Volvo for a great rate (1.9%), gave me a fair price on my trade-in, and even gave me the CPO warranty (7 years/100k miles bumper-to-bumper; better than the factory warranty), all in very short order, so I was able to close the deal quickly, then run home and grab my checkbook and clean out the old car.  At some point during all this the sales manager Tom stopped by to check to make sure I was happy with how everything was going and to give me the lowdown on service; very professional.

Overall a great experience. Admittedly, there was no haggling over price--the $11k off was a take-it-or-leave-it price--but I felt like the staff did a bang-up job making sure I still got taken care of otherwise. 

Totally unlike the Audi dealer I stopped at the day before, who acted like they'd be doing me a huge favor to sell me a car with tons of equipment I didn't want for only slightly less than list.",5.0

36,"September 15, 2017","I found a vehicle online and contacted the dealership by email.  After a week talking with them we came to an agreement on the price.  I advised the sales person that I would be In on Friday to check the vehicle and I gave him my credit union information.  I had the financing lined up.  I called back on the Thursday before I was to go and pick the vehicle up and the sales person advised that they had sold the vehicle to another dealership.  This dealership is very untrustworthy.  It's a shame that people have no morals or ethics anymore.  I would not trust this dealership with a you car.  They might have high end vehicles but they are your typical car salesman.

37,"August 20, 2017","BUYER BEWARE if you are planning to buy a used car I would highly recommend that you go somewhere else. If the car its not one of the cars they normally sale, Audi, Land Rover, etc.. They dont check it every well trust me. No matter what they tell you do not trust them. They sold me a car Aug 2017 and I have nothing but problems with it none of which I could have saw or caused in the short 5 days of total driving time I have had with it. Yes only 5 days I have driven the car and it is currently in the repair shop 7 days and counting. I am not a teenager and I have own numerous cars over my life and I haven't mistreated this car for it to break on me this fast. I dont even have my permanent tags for it yet. Of course I contacted them to tell them of the issues that I have had after I took it to the repair shop and they told me what was wrong with it within a few hours of looking at the car. I made a very reasonable request of them which only would had cost them less then 200 dollars. But before I could say anything about my issue they said "" you cant bring the car back"" like too bad its not their issue that the car is broken. Then only care about making a sale and nothing to do with given you a good car. You should really go somewhere else to buy a car it will save you a lot of issues later. If you still go there anyways good luck to you we warned you, look at the other reviews. ",1.6

Bojan quickly helped us narrow down what we wanted to test drive and identified what our priorities were for a new car purchase.

Though we made 3 trips for various reasons, we bought a vehicle from Bojan that checked all the boxes for what we wanted.   He did a great job running us through all aspects of the sale and was fantastic with the delivery, covering ALL of the auto features.

No report was given to me, I was made to pay, and told that it was in the car; when in fact a report was never printed. This was denied in numerous conversations, only to find that this was in fact written on the receipt. 
I made 5 calls to the service advisor,none were returned over a 6 day period.
It was only when I asked to speak to the GM that I was spoken to, and an attempt was made to resolve the situation.

43,"June 10, 2017","Update to the overall experience with Momentum Land Rover 6/21/2017 - The dealership has done a complete turn around from my first experience below. They've done everything they said they would and have really done a great job. I appreciate everything and if you are looking for a dealership who will take care of your service needs, this is the place! Keep up the great work and work on the first impression to come across this way when someone calls with a concern. It's good to know that you care about the customer and generate an environment that is friendly, courteous and professional.

Update to my review below 6/14/2017 - I took the vehicle into the service department Monday and the experience was totally different than the call on that previous Saturday. There was a 180 degree turn in the attention to my concerns and solutions. They supplied me with a loaner quickly and were very professional and courteous. They have changed my feelings from the first impression. They've also found the problem to our vehicle and should have it repaired tomorrow. I'll give my final review when we pick up the vehicle. I will say for now, they're exceeding my expectations based on the initial contact. 

I have a 2015 Range Rover Evoque that has a check engine light come on and the vehicle isn't running nor shifting properly. I called this morning to get some help and was told that they only have a skeleton crew and their loaner department isn't open today. The next available appointment is at the end of June. I've purchased a Cadillac and was treated as a VIP when I had service concerns. They went out of their way to make sure that my concern was taken care of immediately. They provided a loaner for every type of service with no questions. Momentum treats you like they're doing you a favor by just talking to you.

He then took the info so that he could go through the owners manuals one by one until he found the spare key for my car.  Of course it was love at first sight and I had to have it!  By then we were the last ones in the dealership so we filled out the paperwork we could and then I came back the next day to finish up.  Please keep in mind I wasn't buying the super fancy high dollar Land Rover, I was getting a lower model and he still worked that hard to make sure I had a good experience.  Financing was a breeze with Janette discussing all of my options and before you know it I was driving home in my brand new car with a key chain that matched my exact tan interior of my car thanks to Khalil covering every detail of the sale.  Awesome job!!!",5.0

When I picked up the vehicle all paperwork went quickly and we were out of there with a new ride. He is the only salesman to deal with in my opinion for a Land Rover at Momentum. I also got a great deal for the new car. I appreciate Chad Tatum the sales manager as well for working to earn my business. Thank U Momentum for my new ride!

62,"September 27, 2016","I bought a new jaguar here in 2009.  It has had run-of-the-mill problems and has been out of warranty for a while.  Now, with age, it is starting to act up and I need to bring it in more than usual.  I get great service from their service advisor -- Kevin Sturgess.  He never steers me to more expensive repairs/maintenance than i need, works hard to make sure I get my car back as soon as possible, keeps me updated on the status of my issue, and is very responsive whenever I call.  These sound like simple things that you would expect from anyone in the service business, but IT IS RARE when it comes to cars.  Just the other day, i had a problem with my smart key.  It broke in several pieces when i dropped it on the pavement.  It was totally unusable (and my car couldn't be used without a functioning smart key).  I figured i needed a new key.  This would be about $300 + an additional charge for a service visit for them to program the new key.  Kevin fixed it in 5 minutes and spared me the expense (plus, saved me a 2nd trip to the dealership).  I really appreciate it and would highly recommend anyone ask for Kevin if they own a jaguar and need service.  For those of you considering buying a jaguar, the level of service you get from Momentum should be a top a consideration.  I am very satsified after dealing with them (and Kevin) for the last 7 years.",5.0
63,"September 19, 2016","Just want to express the great buying experience we had a Momentum Jaguar and Bojan Secerkadic.  Our new car buying experience with previous dealerships in the past was not great.  The going back and forth with management in agreeing on a purchase price was tiresome.  Then the process started again with the financing phase of the deal.  But with Bojan and Momentum, we express our budget and were able to agree on a price without the necessary ""haggling"".  Finance was even easier.  They were able to give me a better interest rate than my preapprove loan had within minutes. 

Very pleased with the car buying experience with Bojan and Momentum.  Will definitely recommend to friends.

I read widely car reviews so that I can be fully equipped in understanding the cars I am looking for, particularly on cars I usually dream of owning.   My experience with this dealership was top-notch because  for the three times I have visited this place, all sales consultants who assisted me during my visits were quite impressive and they all had a very good understanding of what we were looking for, very knowledgeable of the cars and products they are selling.  On my third visit, I was accommodated and assisted by their sales consultant, Bojan Secerkadic,  and he was extremely helpful in narrowing my choices.  He went beyond explaining in detail to me what makes the Range Rover click, its technology - its  history, its prestige, and even the emotion and pride that these automobiles bring to prospective buyers.   I was sold with their product right away.  This top-notch customer sales experience was capped by a very efficient and customer-ease in closing  the sales transaction.

In fixing our car the first time, the service/repair shop broke some interior plastic parts which they said would have to be ordered from the factory and would take just a few weeks. Well, nearly three months later and after 5 calls that I made (they never once called us) the parts finally arrived, even though when I called today to yet again check on the parts, they said they have no record of the order whatsoever, to which I very quizzically and frustratingly replied with an invoice number, and then, pow, boom,  shazam!- the parts magically appeared ?!? Seriously ?!? (save your receipts folks). Very disappointing to see a dealership be so quick to take a family's hard-earned money, yet so slow (in fact, non-responsive) in keeping a customer informed on any status. Neither our service advisor nor any parts employees ever called us, not even once.  Mind you, the part is not super critical to the cars function, but broken pieces (that the dealership themselves caused) are unsightly on a $60k+ luxury car. This whole silly matter would be understandable/tolerable if it was a Chevy, Kia or cheap Honda, but definitely not something you expect from a dealership selling and servicing Jaguars.

98,"January 12, 2016","Great experience buying a Land Rover from here and especially from ""Ron Roath"". This was the best dealership experience we have ever had! We have recently been to several other luxury brand dealerships (including BMW, Audi and other Land Rover/Jaguar dealers) and this was definitely different than the others. I won't go in to details of why other dealers were not as good, but we had unpleasant or even nightmare-like experiences in some of them. 
The dealership itself was great, they had an amazing inventory for Land Rovers. Our sales person, Ron, tirelessly helped us look at each of the candidates vehicles one by one in their parking lot. We looked at all the options, we found several one we liked and came to the office. We went into technical details of the cars we chose. Ron explained us every detail of this model. The model we were looking was a very new, but he was still knowledgeable in every technical detail of the car. He also explained and advertised us the Land Rover brand, so that we were more confident that we wanted a car from this brand. 
When we were undecided about which particular options and which car we wanted to select, he helped us by putting printouts of all the applicable inventory items in front of us so that we were able to compare things side by side (never happens in other dealers, they just want you to make up your mind quickly and they would rush you to a decision).
When it came to buying, there was no pressure, no stress, always smiling and helpful. Most importantly, he was always honest and up front; he told us about the hidden expenses so we would not be surprised at the end. He showed us the actual invoice price, MSRP, possible discounts, resale values of the car (or a similar car) in one year, two year time. With this information, we got a pretty good idea about the price and how much negotiation margin we had. Negotiations also went pretty much stressless and at the end we were convinced that we had a good deal and both sides were leaving the table still happy. 
We went with in-dealer financing, it was a painless and pleasant experience. It was quick and very transparent. Financing person (Sara) was a cheerful person. Every item in the papers were explained, every question answered with detail and with courtesy.
After the purchase, Ron patiently waited with us and helped us setup the car even after the closing time.
Ron spent a good half of his day with us. He is an experienced sales person, but don't imagine this like he tries to trick you or anything, on the contrary, he uses his experience to try to read you better and to make you leave happier. As a person he is great, he is fun to talk to, knowledgeable (about many things, but especially his job and his cars) and very energetic.
Overall, we had an awesome experience in this dealer and with Ron helping us with our purchase.

A Area manager for a hotel management chain. :) I will never spend my hard earned money on a racists GM. We were looking at a demo Evoque, but I was gonna buy a new one. I was already pre-approved through my credit union for 97k with a 1.99%  interest rate. :) my credit union told us what to do going into a car dealership never buy the day you are looking. Get a feel for prices, and the cars! My credit union pre approved me for a Land Rover, but I wanted something smaller cause I wouldn't be driving it that much cause I travel all the time. They were trying to sell me a demo 2015 Evoque 43K full loaded. Cool. My dad said take it. I said they told us never take the first offer. I know they can come down some. Right?! Wrong. That was their best and final for a used vehicle. Smh. Eric called his GM, and he was so rude. First, everything is always in a hand shake when you are doing business. Guy wouldn't even shake my hand. It was weird. He looked like we were a bother to him. He was like ""Y'all should go back to the other dealership, better yet I will call them and tell them to have the car ready for you, since you getting a better deal"" I said you don't have to cause its already pulled out because we had an appointment at noon. We only stopped cause we saw the sign from the highway on our way, and thought maybe we could get something closer cause we drove a hour from our home. Anyway. After the GM acted a fool we got up and my dad leaned over to Eric and said I want to give you a shot to get this, cause my father is better than me when he likes people. He wanted to see Eric get the sale for the new car. I told my dad ""No, way!!! I will never spend my hard earned cash on no one like that, and I told Eric not you, your boss"" I think that's when Eric realized he screwed up, and didn't even try! I guess they have trained them to try and weed out "" certain "" people. They didn't want our business.  It's cool with me but I will make a complaint with corporate in the morning. So other people do not get treated like that, everyone should be treated fairly. I guess y'all didn't learn from Ally bank discriminate against customers on auto loans.

They tried to reassure me by telling me they charge everyone these fees.  I told them that ripping everyone off did not make me feel better about being ripped off.  The icing on the cake, was that it was at this moment they informed me that the very nice aftermarket rims which were prominently featured in the ad for the car I had pretty much just bought had been removed and factory rims had been put back on.  What?

I guess most of Momentum's customers have too much money to care about being ripped off for $800... but if that was the case, I would have expected better service.

Rip off + bad service... no thanks.",1.5

After the paper work was done, I immediately wrote a good review in this page putting 5 stars on everything. Two days later I found out that my car had a electrical problem. I called Joseph, the salesman. I explained the situation. He told me to take the car there. Even though I didn't buy the extended warranty, the car apparently passed  inspection, but my heater didn't work. one of the  managers Chad, said that he needed to find out why the car passed the inspection having this problem. I took the car the first time for 2 hours. they didn't look at it. I wasted the whole afternoon. Second time, they looked and they didn't find anything wrong. Third time. I had to wait until the temperature went down to prove them that the heater was not working. they kept insisting that I didn't know  how to turn the heater on.
After the third time Joseph the salesman didn't answer or return the phone calls anymore.
I spoke with one of the technicians. He was courteous but again, he told me that he needed it to see the car.Ii took it again for 3 hours. After that, I was very mad because it was time consuming and it was something very easy to change.
the 5th time he called me and told me to take the car again because they finally had the part.
I took the car for 3 hours and when I picked it up the technician told me that they ordered the wrong part and it was going to take another week. I got so mad and frustrated that I decided not to waste more my time and energy with them. They never took me seriously and made me waste my time making me believe that they were going to help me. I am very disappointed. 
It was very easy for them to buy the $21.00 thermostat and change it right there in one hour, like 2 other mechanics explained to me. they just simply didn't care.  
A friend of mine went with me and he wanted to buy a 90.000 car. but after that my experience, he decided to buy his car in another place. Also, one of the many times that I waited, another client told me that he bought a brand new car $80.000, and one week later he had to come back for some problem and momentum did not loan a car for him. they never do.

Fast forward one year to 11/4/2013 and I bring it in for service and Tracy Desormeaux says they won't cover the service until it has 10k miles.  I pay for the service and $50 for the tires to be rotated myself.

Today, I bring it to the Volvo dealer in Plano, TX because it has finally reached 10k miles and I mention that this is the first time it will be having a free factory service.  The dealer is shocked!  They tell me that Momentum should have serviced the car once a year even if it did not meet the minimum mileage requirement.  I told the Plano dealer that Momentum refused to service the car until it had 10k miles.

I also had my tires rotated today at the Plano, TX dealer.  The cost was $25.  That is half of what I paid over one year ago to Momentum Volvo to do that service on this car on November 12, 2012.

I feel like such an idiot for doing business with Momentum Volvo.  I have a 2006 XC90 that I purchased before I moved to Houston and I regularly brought it to Momentum for service.  I am sure I was overcharged regularly.

The service advisor was the best part of the morning.  Edwin Viera was very friendly and courteous throughout that morning.  

My service took about 2 hours.  When I got to my LR4, I noticed that the driver's mat was muddy (not that way when I brought it) and they left the hood partially open so I had to get out and close it myself.  As I was pulling out of the parking lot, the low coolant warning light went on, so I had to come right back.  Of course, the service was supposed to include checking the fluids, so I don't know how that was missed.

When I brought it back, they took another 1 hour to fix this problem.  Don't know exactly why it took so long, but at least the warning light was no longer on.  However, this time the center arm rest was noticeably blackened with an oily stain and the inside smelled like oil.  I was eager to get out of there so I didn't bother asking them to clean up their mess.

So, basically I came there at 8 am and left at 11 am for a simple oil change and a few basic checks.  As an added bonus for the $424 I paid, I got a messy and smelly cabin.  Thanks for the experience!

Once I mentioned the whole situation to Taylor, he was very apologetic behalf of the dealership and their service departments lack of taking ownership of the problem.  He then took the car for a test drive and took their chief mechanic's advice and assured me that he was fix the problem! He replaced all the tires on the vehicle and made sure the car now drove correctly as it should.  

Taylor's approach to the problem and it's resolution was commendable.  He is an example of what real customer service should be.  He rectified what the problem was and took ownership of the situation and resolved the issue rather than trying to avoid having to pay for the tires unlike his colleagues.

256,"July 12, 2014","I was in the market for one of the new Jaguar F-Type R Coupes.   I live in Austin TX where we have a decent dealer, but they're small in terms of volume so they couldn't get me a slot for a custom build until November or December.  I didn't want to wait that long so I called around all the dealers in Texas - 2 in Dallas, 1 in FT Worth, 2 in Houston, 1 in San Antonio.  Amazing test if you will - some of these dealers NEVER called me back, some did so but at best were days later.  Momentum was far and away the most responsive.  They had an internet sales rep (Marcela) respond to me right away and then she passed me over to Steven Hill who is one of the F-Type product experts.  What a great experience that was.

Steven knew EVERYTHING about the car, the options, even local marketing events in my area (a ""good to be bad"" day at the COTA).  I asked him about possible window tinting and radar detector installation and I had quotes via email in less than 4 hours.   I placed the order back in April and Steven kept me up-to-date on the status of my delivery every couple of weeks.  When the car arrived the experience only got better.  My wife and I drove down to Houston to pick it up and when we got there my new car was parked right in the center of their main show room.   While the finance team worked up the paperwork Steven took me for a drive to demonstrate several key capabilities of the car and walked us through all the different features.  The finance team was quick and efficient, presenting us with several add-on options without being pushy.  (I always by tire & wheel insurance - its saved me thousands in each car I've owned).  When presented with options I didn't want, she moved on right away.  I was in and out of the finance office in less 15 min tops.

But here's the best part - you could just tell that Steven was having a genuine blast selling us this car.  He took pictures of my wife and I, a video of the car pulling out of the main showroom, all just for fun.  (We're getting copies of course :-).  My wife and I talked about it all the way back to Austin, its a shame more dealers don't have this kind of service.  I've bought several high end cars, and I have to say this is probably tied for my best buying experience ever.  

Kudos to the Momentum Jaguar team for making Steven a product specialist.  It shows and had a huge impact on my buying experience.  I'd absolutely buy a car from them again.",4.8

(1) Bait and switch.  After trying to negotiate down the price of the car unsuccessfully, I relented because of their supposed policy where they do not decrease the price offered. I paid the price at which it was offer.  (In hindsight, unwise.)  When I went to take the car home, IT WAS A DIFFERENT CAR. They switched the car for a model with less features (no compass, for instance). I then had to argue with the manager for two hours to get the car for which I bargained. 

(2) We agreed on a price without consideration of a trade-in. After, I asked if they would buy my old car. They gave me a low ball offer of $750 and said they could not go higher.  I signed the paperwork with the intent of returning the next day to pay for the car.  We sold the old car to a different dealership for $2500.  The next day, the Volvo dealership refused to give me the Volvo unless I PAY THE $750 DIFFERENCE.  THIS WAS OUTSIDE THE CONTRACT.  I should have returned the car then since there were already fraudulent twice. (In hindsight, unwise.)

(3) I decided to get a car loan because interest rates were generally low.  The loan lady ""credit officer"" did not know anything about the credit terms. She had to google basic answers. Without notifying me and without my permission, she applied for MULTIPLE LOANS, which hurt my near perfect credit score. I only gave her permission to get my credit score and to get A loan.

I generally like the Volvo itself, although the blind spot information system is a waste of money. In hindsight, I wouldn't pay a dime for it. This dealership, however, is fraudulent at best. The other Momentum dealerships may or may not be as bad. I know this issue was pervasive through management.",1.2
266,"September 05, 2013","I was an out of town buyer and flew in to Houston specifically for a vehicle that I decided to buy sight unseen. I waited over 2 hours just to get in front of a finance person. During the closing it was mentioned that some kind of window/wheel warranty and a theft insurance was part of the price. This was never discussed and given that my bank had already written a check for the exact amount, I decided to continue. 

Following the finance portion, My wife and I were handed the keys and our sales woman told us thatbshe didn't have time to take us through the car due to other customers. She let us know we could wait another hour or so and maybe she could get back to us. It was almost laughable how unprofessional she was.  Given that we now had a 700 mile drive ahead, I decided we could figure it out by ourselves. 

Got home and found that a light was out. This was a certified pre-owned vehicle and this should have been covered. Over the next 6 weeks, I sent no less than 10 emails, including the sales manager asking for an update. I even set weekly reminders to send them emails (and I called and left messages), yet the emails and calls went unanswered for over 6 weeks. 

Next, my tag was not sent in properly and finally an admin assisted me and was very responsive after the temp tag had already expired. 

I called the sales manager and requested he call me back, as I thought he might want some constructive feedback. No return call.

267,"November 16, 2012","I went to the dealership to purchase either a new Range Rover Sport, or a Certified used one, depending on what they had at the lot. The salesman was very nice and helpful initially, as I was unsure of what I wanted, he answered all my questions thoroughly. I left that day and said I would think about if I wanted a new rrs or a particular certified rrs sc they had on their lot.  I was hesitant to purchase a new one, because I was told I would have to wait over 8 weeks for the rrs, and they can't tell me the price of the rrs yet, or what it looked like because it was the upcoming model year. I was also hesitant to purchase the rrs I had seen on the lot because a search of the vin showed that it was listed the month prior at another dealership, uncertified, for $10,000 less. I emailed the salesman to ask about a different supercharged certified rrs on their website. I offered $3,000 less than the list price. On a $73,000+ I didn't think a $3,000 discount was insulting. I didn't hear back after a message that he would look into it, and three days later when I asked again for an update I was told that I am asking for the impossible, they do not negotiate on the price of cars, and they are no haggle. When I asked if they had any Range Rover Sports Certified under my price range limit, I was told I was again, I am asking for something that can't be done, and all subsequent communications were ignored. A search of the Land Rover website showed they had 7 rrs that fit the criteria I had asked for, so I was not being unreasonable with my offer. That experience was enough to turn me away from the Land Rover brand and took my business to elsewhere. ",1.4

I made an appointment and brought my car to them yesterday.I figured with an appointment, that I wouldn't be kept waiting. I was for over 10 minutes. The people in the service department were dismissive. Finally, Matt came to the desk I was sitting at and told me he had to fill out paperwork and someone would be with me soon. I got tired of waiting and went to the service manager to try and speed up the process that was not explained to me and I really had no idea what was going on. Richard didn't listen to me and kept saying that Matt would be right with me. I had to repeat myself 3 times to Richard before he actually listened to what I had to say. I went back to Matt and he said that the oil change would cost 99.00. I said no, I was told that the first oil change was free. He said that the policy is a free oil change under 8000 miles. I bought the car with 5000 miles already on it and no one said there was a mileage cut off when I bought the car. I went back to Richard and explained what I was told before and what I'm being told now. At this point, it was no longer about the free oil change, but the disrespectful and dismissive manner in which they conducted their business. Richard came back and said he would give me the oil change for free, but he had a bit of an attitude about it.

269,"March 13, 2012","The buying experience at Momentum was typical with no problems or hassles.  However, after sales service leaves a lot to be desired.  The following is my experience from a recent service visit.

•	It took almost 4 days to diagnose a recent AC problem on my Jaguar.  
•	The initial diagnosis was incorrect.  The service rep told me that the AC checked out fine and it didn’t have a problem.  I advised that they needed to check again.  They needed to get the car out of their air conditioned shop and drive it around in the heat, and then determine if it was functioning as it should.  At my request, they took it outside and found that it did truly have a problem.
•	Over the 4 days of diagnosis work, the service reps did not keep me very well informed as to what was going on.  I had to call them and leave messages for them to call me back.  This was very poor follow up.
•	More on the diagnosis.  The second diagnosis was a problem with the expansion valve, possibly debris.  When they told me this I questioned how debris could be in the system.  They suggested hose deterioration.  Hose deterioration is possible but I doubt it on a 4 year old car.  I suggested that the debris could be debris from the failed compressor from a year earlier (covered under warranty).  Then the story changed.  I was told that there was no debris in the expansion valve.  I was told that the expansion valve was stuck and could not function.   This leads me to believe that they were not certain as to the root cause of the problem, or they were trying to avoid a second warranty claim.  Why did the story change?
•	Last, I was told that the repair would not be covered under warranty, even though the car was 23,000 miles under its mileage warranty and only a couple of weeks over its time warrantee.  I did not expect this from a high end car dealership.  This AC problem was a problem that existed for months, maybe since the compressor was changed out a year earlier.  This failure should have been considered an existing problem.  There was no budging Momentum or Jaguar from their decision.
•	Subsequently, I took the car to another shop and had the expansion valve changed out (per Momentum’s diagnosis).  The shop doubted Momentum’s diagnosis but changed out the valve anyway.  There were no debris found in the valve and there were no indications that the valve was ever stuck.  A new valve was installed and the AC problem still persisted. The Momentum misdiagnosis was incorrect (again).
•	Loosing confidence in Momentum that the car AC would never be fixed, I sold the car. 

If I had kept the car, I would have never used Momentum’s Service center again, and I will never buy another car from Momentum.

* * * * * * *

Mr. Dugger,
 
I just wanted to let you all know that Steven Hill has earned his way into being my car salesman for life.  In May of 2010, I purchased a Volvo XC90 from him, and was extremely pleased with his service and attention, even though I knew I am not one of your most prestigious clients.  He treated me, however, with kindness and a genuine concern that I made the best purchase for myself.
 
This year, when it came time for my wife's car to pass on into its next life, we came back to Momentum Volvo first to check out the selection.  We found a car we loved (a red-orange S60), but my wife wasn't sure she wanted us to be a Two-Volvo family.  Over the next few weeks, we searched the internet for countless hours, and visited three other dealerships to check out some cars she was interested in.
 
At the first place, we were confronted by a greasy salesman.
At the second place, we found a car we liked, but the salesman and the manager did not try at all to meet us where we were at as far as our needs and our budget.
At the third place, we found a car, and my pen was literally hovering above the signature line when the manager ran in and told us that Mac Haik himself told them not to sell me the car, but to hold it for one of his friends' daughters, and we felt humiliated... I almost wrote to the Chronicle, and the temptation still lingers.
 
At that point, I'd had enough, and I immediately left their parking lot and drove directly back to the man I knew was safe and trustworthy and would take care of us no matter what.  Steven ended up selling us our second Volvo, the red-orange S60 we saw the first time, and it's a DREAM CAR for us.  My wife absolutely loves it, and we both LOVE getting into the drivers seat.  Hands down, one of the best salesmen I've ever met in my life... and that's coming from a Regional Recruiter for Verizon Wireless who has interviewed literally thousands of salesmen.  We drove the car home that night.
 
Steven already knows this, but I wanted you to know as well... the next time I buy a car, I already know who's table I'll be sitting at.
