0,"June 23, 2020",I bought a used 2017 Ford Expedition EL and Tina Lowery was the sales person that assisted me. She was EXCELLENT! Very helpful and let me take the vehicle to my house to show my wife since we have a newborn plus a toddler at home. The entire Johnson Brothers staff was friendly and helpful! üëçüèªüëçüèª,5.0
1,"June 10, 2020","Our saleswoman Tina had a great knowledge base! We had a lot of questions since this was our first time buying a vehicle to pull a trailer. Tina knew the answers to our questions and also knew where to quickly find information that was more specific to the vehicle we were looking at. We could feel the confidence in her answers. This was a very different feel from other salespeople who answer with ‚ÄúI‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs equipped‚Äù or ‚ÄúI think that feature is included‚Äù etc. We went back and forth to this dealership several times. When Tina was busy she quickly recruited Micheal to help and he was great too. The process of buying a vehicle was great from beginning to end. Also, I would like to add that I greatly appreciate that all of these individuals wore masks during this period of uncertainty with the coronavirus. ",5.0

4,"May 20, 2020",Darren was great. Called and negated a deal before I arrived.  I inspected the truck and purchased within 2hr. Found out one of the keys was broken when I returned home Darren contacted a guy down in Austin  close to me and had a new key made. The finance guy was great and very competent. If I buy another truck from a dealership it will more than likely be from them. ,5.0

Their ability to meet our requests and maintain a professional and enthusiastic experience during the process is one of the reasons I will continue to come back to this dealership. Their staff is helpful, friendly, and accommodating beyond expectations. Mike Tubbs has always been quick to help my family, and Joe McCartney in finance is like the wizard of numbers.

27,"August 19, 2019","I stopped in to have my truck looked at before we turned it back in, due to it being a lease. I decided I wanted to look at the new Expeditions and they did not disappoint. Jon Fox was so professional, friendly, patient and most of all not pushy. I truly felt like family! I ended up getting all the way to finance and was still impressed by Joe. He picked up the phone and fought for me and I‚Äôm extremely thankful. I‚Äôm now an owner of a 2019 Expedition and it‚Äôs perfect.

51,"December 02, 2018","Mike Tubbs took the time to take photos of a newly received used vehicle and sent them to me. I went to the dealership with theirs and one other car on my list to look at. Mike's description of the car was dead on, the test drive went great, they were very fair on the trade in and Mike answered all of my questions and offered assistance with no pressure. 
 Mike Tubbs and Jonathon Fox made us feel so comfortable that we kept them late to buy the car without even going to look at the other one on my list.
Thanks Mike!  
Update:
I was extremely satisfied with my experience until I went to change the oil in the vehicle and found that the drain plug had been put in so tight that the bolt head was rounded off and the oil filter had been improperly seated. 
Update:
 They were very helpful and without any hassle what so ever corrected the issue. When you have an issue is when you really test a company and John Bros proved to be top notch.
 My wife said it best ""I really like those people.

52,"November 24, 2018","Thanksgiving evening, I narrowed down my used car choices to several cars at various dealerships via an internet search. Despite arriving half an hour before opening hours on Black Friday, my husband and I  were welcomed by sales agent, Wyatt Falkinberry.  When we showed him the car we were interested in, he knew the car's owner history and had an impressive knowledge of the car's specs, even though it was a Nissan Rogue at a Ford dealership. The test drive convinced us that if we could agree on a price, we would be happy to drive the Rogue off the lot. Wyatt was straightforward and personable, and we came to an agreement in minutes. We then met Joe McCartney, who expedited a plethora of necessary paperwork. My husband and I have never experienced such a streamlined and courteous car-buying event! If you've ever had an exhausting high-pressure encounter at a car dealership, do yourself a favor and give Johnson Brothers Ford a try.  ",5.0

When it came down to trying to decide between two, he compared the carfax of the two point by point to give me a clear picture of the one that was for me.  The whole experience was easy and I knew when I drove off in my new truck I had made the perfect choice for me.

63,"July 02, 2018","I called this dealership after I had to stop by the side of the road when a wrench (representing the power train warning signal) appeared on the dashboard. I contacted the service department and was assisted by Brian who was so helpful. The service departments schedule was completely full so I was going to have to get a rental, leave my car at the dealership and go back home to Austin and postpone my trip to Ft Worth. While Brian was finding me a rental and reviewing the terms of my service agreement with me, a mechanic (I wish I could remember his name) walked into the room and said that my car was ready. He found an opportunity to run a diagnostic check on the car and learned that all it needed was a computer update. Gratefully I only had to pay for the diagnostic check and was soon on my way to continue my trip to Ft. Worth.

When I called in from the road, Brian explained to me what I needed to do on my cell phone to get directions to dealership. He took my phone number so he could call me if I didn‚Äôt show up within 15-20 minutes. When I arrived he saw that I was using a cane, he made sure that I always had a place to sit and brought all the paperwork to me so I didn‚Äôt have to stand in line. He was so friendly and kind and focused on my needs. As for the mechanic, I was so impressed that the service department found a way to do the diagnostic check so quickly so I could be on my way. I asked the woman at the desk if there wasn‚Äôt some survey I could complete to express my satisfaction. She showed me where to find the survey on line. What could have been a terrible experience turned out to be one of the most pleasant experiences I have ever had with a dealership service department in my sixty-six years.

64,"June 20, 2018","I was living abroad and needed a new truck for when I returned. I told my salesperson Kevin Long exactly what I wanted‚Äî late model F250, low miles, lariat, 4x4 and sunroof.  I also worked directly with the GM Lacy as my wife knows her. Only a couple days later she emailed me to let me know she thinks she had one I would be interested in.  It fit the bill 100%!!

We agreed a price over email and when I got back, I went in to buy the truck. Kevin Long met me immediately, went over every detail of my new certified pre-owned truck as if it were brand new. I really appreciated his care in making sure I knew everything about the truck!  Side note‚Äî Kevin, my wife and I really got to know each other on the test drive and what a really great guy!!

70,"May 22, 2018","I bought my SHO 5 years back (2013) after attempting to get straight answers from several local firms.  Everyone wanted to sell me what was on the lot, although I had specified what I wanted online before the visit.  ""Andy"" at Johnson Bros was all business, and was glad to ""special order"" the car I desired, at a reasonable  -no haggle- price.    I am 5 miles from a large Dealer , and closer to several others than the 35 miles to Johnson Bros, but I have had the car serviced there thrice yearly with only one complaint: my just-waxed beauty was given a ""Free Wash"" which did not include a dry. I wrote this off as good intentions gone wrong at the pointed end.  I even bought a set of new tires last visit -something I've never done from a dealer! ",4.8

73,"May 11, 2018",A very well run business top to bottom.  Johnson Brothers Ford makes car buying a pleasant experience in a very competitive business.  It is hard to find a dealer like Johnson Brothers that will take the time to make each customer feel like they are the best customer on the lot. ,5.0
74,"May 01, 2018","After my wife test drove the vehicles we were interested in and she decided which one she liked better, Joel did the leg work and made the sale.  The time working with Joel was pleasant.  Jon worked out all of the financial issues and made the sale work with our pricing goals.  Kenny did a great job of walking me through the explanations of all of the electronics.  The only thing overlooked was the door code which was easily provided over the phone.  

The one issue I do have is this car is a Certified Pre-Owned vehicle and I believe Ford prides itself with providing a top shelf vehicle when they get this designation.  They make sure all warranty issues are taken care of prior to the sale.  What we found was they do not update the navigation to the most current version prior to the sale.  I guess that's one way to make money off of the ""sucker"" who failed to ask that this be done before pickup.   I'm disappointed that Johnson Brothers is so tight that they would not provide a ""full update"" to everything on the vehicle before letting it get out of the door.  When speaking with Eddie Young (sales manager on the use car side), he seemed powerless to try and keep a new customer satisfied.

I purchased my prior Fords at other dealerships, going hundreds of miles, just because I felt the customer service side of things was handled poorly.  I'm sorry but an update that costs Ford $1 to mass produce a Sim Card and they sell for $150.00 in the parts/sales department should be provided to the buyer of any Certified Pre-Owned vehicle.  

I will look elsewhere for the purchase of my next Ford truck.

Maria Martinez helped arrange the financing portion of the deal, and was equally as helpful and courteous as Joel.

What I enjoyed was there was absolutely no pressure. Joel knew the inventory well and could tell you the backstory of many of the used and pre-owned vehicles.

105,"April 11, 2017","We had been searching for a gently used Ford Edge for 3 weeks in Austin. We decided to look outside of our city, because of quality of used cars we were shown and the feeling we were shopping at a used car lot that was not attached to a Ford dealership in all its dishonesty, lack of professionalism, cleanliness (cars and offices...seriously!)  and disrespect. We will never buy a new car from these dealerships from our treatment on their used lots. We stumbled into Johnson Brothers after another disappointing journey to a large Ford dealership a few cities over from them. We headed back to Austin incredibly frustrated and then we saw the light at the end of the tunnel. From the moment we stepped onto the lot of Johnson Brothers to the moment we drove off in the car we purchased, we were treated with respect and professionalism. Every single person we encountered valued our interest in purchasing a car from them and then handled the sale with genuine appreciation. Joel Flores in sales went above and beyond.He did more listening than talking which is exactly what we needed at this point in our car buying journey. He made sure every detail and concern was addressed so we never questioned if we had found the right car, right salesperson and right dealership. The car was detailed so clean, I felt as if I purchased a new car. Joel just did not close the deal by the way, he spent a half hour showing us all the features and connecting my phone for a safer drive back to Austin. This was done AFTER the dealership had closed. He could of handed the keys over and locked the doors to get home, but he took an extra huge step in customer care  that will not be forgotten. We are incredibly thankful especially with the drive home at night in a storm down the dreaded 35!

Furthermore, I have purchased many car in my years and I have never had a GM come and take time out to first come and introduce himself and listen to my concerns and share his experience and general life conversation. I can see where Michael, and Andy get there exceptional, extraordinary people skills from. Mike and Andy thank you for sharing your experience with my wife and I. It has truly been a pleasure meeting you all and purchasing our lovely unbelievable vehicle from Johnson Brothers Ford and  Lincoln, best mid size car on the market, which I will highly recommend. Thanks a million guys for all you help.",5.0

208,"August 11, 2011","We recently purchased a new F-150 at Johnson's Brothers and it was a GREAT experience.  Our sales consultant (Michael Moneyhun) was very friendly, curtious and knowledgeable on the F-150.  We didn't intend to buy a vehicle that particular day, just look and get a price quote but the more time we spent with Michael the more impressed I was with him and the entire dealership.  He went the extra mile for us, he got us a few hundred more dollars for our trade-in and he thoroughly explained the unique sync system and features.  He even set up our two phones on the system before we left the dealership.  He's the reason we bought the truck their and why we didn't go back to the dealership where we bought our last new vehicle.  Highly recommend the dealership and Michael Moneyhun as a sales consultant if you are looking for a new Ford...",5.0
209,"June 22, 2011","My husband and I had our minds set on the 2011 Ford Explorer.  Johnson Brother's Ford had the Explorer for us.  Jack Anderson was AWESOME!  He was friendly, funny, accomodating, and knowledgeable.  He made us feel like were his neighbors and that we weren't just a commission check.  Jack takes pride in his job and it shows in the way he treats his customers.  I appreciated Jack's knowledge on the options that we got on our Explorer and especially how to work them.  I would recommend Jack to our friends.

Casey in finance was amazing.  He was friendly and funny.  We could tell that he enjoys his job and working with customers.

We felt like royalty at Johnson Brother's Ford.  ",5.0

211,"March 11, 2011","Dealt with many dealerships throughout the years and Johnson Brothers is head and shoulders above the rest in service in my book. The team of service writers is knowledgeable and friendly and the service tech's are perfectionists. I'm a dedicated customer, having finally found a service dept that genuinely takes care of the customer. I've thought of buying another brand vehicle but since I would lose my service dept I am staying with Ford & JOHNSON BROTHERS SERVICE DEPT.",4.8
212,"July 24, 2008","This is a great dealership!  They made the process quick and easy...I wouldn't think of going anywhere else!
