1,"November 08, 2015","We've all had those experiences of sitting in a dealership for 5 hours in what feels like a high stakes poker game with loads of pressure from a sales team for you to cave on a price. This place is ANYTHING but that! What a great dealership! I found a vehicle on cars.com and soon became communicating via email with Jeff Smith, the internet sales manager. Super fast in response times and eager to give me an honest response on my questions. 

I ended up driving 4+ hours to come buy the car because they had it priced so well. Once we got there, it was quick and easy. Worth the drive! I will keep this dealership in my when my friends and family need to purchase. 

Thanks again! Loving my Jeep Grand Cherokee!

2,"August 19, 2015","May I say, the experience Atzenhoffer has given me in purchasing my vehicle has been nothing less of phenomenal. Your team really knows how to make a customer feel appreciated. Working with the public I know the importance of customer service, and may I say I rate Atzenhoffer with 5 stars. I always feel welcomed and I never feel like I am bothering anyone with my questions. From the moment I walked in to service my vehicle to the process of finalizing my new car deal I must applaud everyone from the service department to sales to the financing department; everyone was truly approachable, friendly, and a joy to be around. Dâ€™ree, Jeff, Scott, and Raymond were great to work with, and once again I would like to say thank you to your team for making this a great car purchasing experience.",5.0
