0,"October 01, 2019","After stopping by after work one Wednesday afternoon, I intended to look at a new truck I had my eye on. I met with Jimmy Buckner who went out of his way to explain the features of the vehicle and explain why purchasing that vehicle was a sound investment. I decided to see what kind of deal I could get, so went inside. Jimmy worked diligently right up to quitting time to get me a price I agreed on, so I ended up purchasing the truck that afternoon. The buying experience was low stress and I really felt that he was truly working for me to get me the best deal possible on the truck. I will definitely be back for all of my sales and service needs. Thanks to the entire Cecil Atkission team for helping me purchase my dream truck. ",5.0
