5,"May 12, 2019","I was treated as a person, not a potential customer. I felt absolutely no pressure in purchasing my Corolla from Angel. Angel  explained every detail with great patience. I've had occasion in dealing with the service department quite a few times and, again, had above par customer service. 

My 93 year old mother bought her 2014 Camry from Angel and has only spoken of him as a very kind and considerate person. She loves the happy birthday calls!

My sister is seriously considering buying a replacement Toyota as her Prius is 11 years old.  Of course we will steer her to Angel.

Thank you",5.0

18,"May 03, 2019","Our review is the content of the text message sent to Mike Conner on 5/3/19:

Mike, This is Gina Sonson.  I‚Äôm following up with you as I think you should know what we thought of our buying experience from your dealership, particularly about your finance manager, Jason. We weren‚Äôt treated right by him.  It pains me to say this about anyone, but your finance manager Jason is shady & dishonest with his dealing with us.  He was also very contentious when my husband asked questions as if we were challenging his authority ad made us feel like we weren‚Äôt entitled to answers about the loan or the paperwork.  The way he responded and treated my husband was disrespectful and unprofessional.  I had to walk out of his office upset because of that.  Jason has integrity issues that he lied to our son about us already knowing the conditions of a higher APR and shorter term (from 72 to 60 mos) resulting in higher monthly payments attached to the approval of the college rebate.  He told our son that we already knew those conditions because he told us!  He absolutely lied!  No way would we have pursued that rebate as hard as we did, driven all the miles returning to your dealership, if we had prior knowledge of those conditions from the beginning.  No Way!  After going through the process of approval for the rebate (and getting approved) and our son waiting over four hours at your dealership only to find out about the hidden conditions we could not accept‚Äîit was all for nothing.  You have a finance manager who is dishonest and lied to us.  He was shady with us, which makes me weary that he might pocket the rebate meant for our loan as our rebate application was approved.  Its hard to think that way but it happens.  Pete Mankins Nissan dealership in Texarkana had a situation like that just this week you might be aware.  

We have bought many cars over the years but this is the only time I‚Äôve felt compelled to write to the GM.  Jason could use a class in customer service and customer communication.  But the integrity issue is something that calls for a one-on-one with you that you need to address.  ",1.8
19,"May 01, 2019",Everett has maintained my 4 Runner for the last three years. All maintenance has been professionally completed and on time. The service technicians are all fully qualified and take pride in their work. The waiting area is comfortable and the facility is always spotlessly clean. Once the service has been completed all vehicles are washed as a courtesy to the customer. The service advisors are familiar with Toyotas and many other brands of vehicles and are friendly and easy to talk to about any problem I might have with my car. EXCELLENT  CUSTOMER SERVICE.,4.8
20,"May 01, 2019",I was very impressed with the quality of service and level of professionalism the team at Everett demonstrated. Shelby went above and beyond to provide the best in service. I will definitely be returning in the near future to look at a replacement for my truck. ,5.0

32,"April 26, 2019","What I like about Everett Toyota is that I am always met by a smiling service writer, welcoming me as I pull in the service bay.  Brian Roberts was the service professional this time and he introduced me to Jacob, if I recall, who was training this day.  I was kept informed as to the progress of my service and was shown the cabin air filter that they suggested to be replaced.  I totally agreed after seeing it.  Then when my vehicle was ready Brian walked with me to the cashier's desk and explained what they did and what they found to be in order.  I always pleased when I leave that dealership and it ends like it begins with a smiling face and a thank you.

47,"April 11, 2019","On 01/29/19 I took my RAV4 in for 5000 mile or 6 month service. Although no oil change was required I requested they change it and I would pay for it, which I did. It did not take 30 to 40 minutes and my vehicle was  serviced was brought back to me.  I thought , that sure was quick for what was required. when I got home I checked wheels and they showed no signs of being Rotated as listed on Check sheet as done. I could not tell if Oil change was done.
On 04/1019 I took my RAV4 in for 10,000 miles or 12 month service which included an oil change and maintenance.  Before I Left home I etched a mark on Left front wheel for ID purpose. When my vehicle was returned to me I did not check wheel as I did not won't to cause a scene and argument so I left. Upon arrival home I checked the left front wheel and it was still there with the etched mark. Now this leaves me in doubt as to what was really done on both 5000 and 10,000 mile service.

Refusing to help my mom out we leave. I then call Everett himself and he interrupted my story and said go back to the dealership, his GM was going to help us out. On the way back the secretary calls saying they can't do anything about it because the van was already scratched, which it wasn't, i call Everett again and he tells me again to proceed to the dealership, at this moment we were coming back from winnsboro, where we live. Making us drive back, when we got there the GM wasnt professional enough to come out and talk to us, he kept sending his men to tell us theres nothing they can do, and to return that following monday. The secretary got hurt because I asked her what kind of show they were running... seemed crooked to me, she got hurt and mad and rudely told me not to call them crooked. I asked for the walk around sheet and she tried to fight against it but she finally got it, NOWHERE on that walk around sheet did it say the van had a big scratch in the side and when i called her out on that she got even more aggravated. After a long conversation we decide to come back monday. We bring the van in, they AGREED to fix the damage, the next day, they call us, we show up and they tell us they apologize but they can't fix it because the body shop will need to remove the door and get it repainted, and that's a high cost. So even after admiting the damage, in the end they didn't fix it, somebody just grabbed a near similar color marker and filled in the damage unprofessionaly. I will make sure to post this everywhere that has EVERETT TOYOTA on it and will be opening a claim with the better bussiness bureau soon.",1.0
