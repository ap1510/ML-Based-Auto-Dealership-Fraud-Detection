1,"July 14, 2019",The staff was great and very accommodating. I will be back. We were in a hurry for an appointment and they got us done on time. ,5.0
2,"April 08, 2018",We always get in promptly and get exceptional friendly service from very capable technicians.  We drive over 45 miles in the opposite direction from where we work because of the outstanding service we always receive and because we trust the Hoffoauir family. ,5.0
3,"August 15, 2016","OK, so after 3 years, one engine tear down hoffpauir marble falls, one engine rebuild hoffpauir burnet, then an engine replacement again hoffpauir burnet. Three dealers which now include Hoffpauir Lampassas and $8000.00 my truck is still parked six months after getting the engine replaced, with electrical problems that the burnet hoffpauir told me to simply pull the fuses( which didn't work the battery still dies. The dealers keep shuttling me between themselves and claim no responsibility as they are sold. Now ( I am an electrician) I decided to try to isolate the short myself, finding out that I have 9 wires in my main fuse box that are grounded and creating a 10 volt parasitic draw on my system, why they couldn't find this is beyond me as they are Chevy certified mechanics So now my problem is I want a schematic for my truck from the dealer so I can verify and try to fix this issue and they tell me to simply google it. Or if I come in they might could print me up something. DO NOT DO SERVICE WORK WITH THIS DEALER. If you do and are not satisfied they will simply send you around to 3 different dealers all claiming to have no responsibility and to have been sold and refuse to honor anything after that sold date etc and so on.",1.0
4,"March 31, 2010","Below is the text from a letter sent to the owner.  He did not respond.  Shop at your own risk with these guys.

I started internet shopping on Monday, 2/22.  I had a few calls with Pat Guzman during the week regarding a 2009 Traverse with 11,227 miles.  Mid week, Pat advised he just learned the vehicle wasn’t onsite but would be returned Saturday, 2/27.  I emailed Pat the morning of Thursday, 2/25 with an offer.  I never heard back.  I called back at 5:45PM and Pat was out of the office.  Your Sales Manager, Tommy Holloman, advised the deal would work.  He told me to call Pat Friday morning.  That evening, I forwarded the email to Pat suggesting the Sales Manager had confirmed the deal.
 
On Friday, 2/26 Pat called me and advised the vehicle would be ready Saturday.  We verbally confirmed the deal.  He advised the purchase order would be faxed over in about 30 minutes.  I advised I would have my trade vehicle towed to his attention Friday afternoon and we would pick up the Traverse on Saturday, 2/27 at 2:30PM.  The towing company confirmed delivery of my Jeep around 2:30 Friday afternoon.  Two and a half hours later after I still had not received the purchase order.  I called, but Pat was out of the office.  I spoke with your Business Mgr and they quickly took some information and the PO was faxed over.  After receiving the PO, I went to my credit union to finalize the paperwork.  At that point they faxed over the deal confirmation to your dealership.  

Around 5:30PM on Friday, 2/26, Pat called and advised there was a dent in the vehicle.  I advised I didn’t buy a vehicle with a dent.  He advised that I could still pick it up on Saturday, but I would have to bring it back out on Thursday for the repair.  I would leave it and then pick it up again on Saturday, 3/6.  I advised that it was a 70 mile one way trip for me and I was very disappointed.  He said he understood.  I asked if the general manager was OK with the handling of this deal, he said yes.  I advised I would like to speak with the owner.  He said he would call back when he confirmed your availability.  

Pat called me Saturday morning and advised that mileage had increased from 11,227 to 16K+.  I advised that was not what I purchased.  He said he understood, but couldn’t do anything about it.  He advised the owner would be available on Monday at 9AM.  I advised Pat I would call him then to confirm your availability.  Less than five minutes after ending that conversation, the Sales Manager calls me back.  He takes issue with my comments regarding misrepresentation.  He tells me I was told it was a demo.  I advise him I was never told it was a demo.  I asked him how that was not misrepresentation?  He didn’t answer my question.  He advised he didn’t want to do business with me.  He said that he had discussed with the owner and the owner doesn’t want to talk to me.  I advised that I would confirm and that I would track you down.  He said “get to tracking.”

5,"March 27, 2010","Bought a new Mustang (2010 GT) recently from this dealership. Here are the things that were wrong:

1) They changed the price of the car on the document when it came time to sign. Increased it by $1400.00 from the amount agreed upon. Granted, this was an oversight on my part (should have double checked it) but I did not expect them to be this sleazy. I have purchased 4 new cars in the past and have never had anyone actually do this.

2) I believe I was charged an exorbitant amount ($1800) in finance charge (incidently the amount was no where close to this in my last purchase.)

3) The vehicle had several scratches (not easily visible when the car was wet) on the hood, front fenders, and roof.

4) The spare key and the code was from a completely different vehicle. Had to go back to get it taken care of.

In the end, this experience has been the most unpleasant buying experience yet. Talking to people in town about this experience has revealed similar experiences from others as well.",1.0
