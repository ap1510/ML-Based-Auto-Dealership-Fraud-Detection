1,"January 13, 2019","In one day starting with a phone call to the agency, I was able to sale and buy a Certified Pre-Own vehicle. The experience was great and the facilities are just perfect. We enjoyed working with Alison and Travis. A great experience...!    ",4.8
2,"December 27, 2018","Love the new dealership and the sales staff is great.  They had no problem with us test driving several variations of the same car.  When it came time to buy our original sales person was unavailable, that's when Allison stepped in.  She is amazing and so fun to be with.  No pressure and very helpful throughout the whole process.  When we found a few minor issues after the sale she was on it and helped us out all the way. ",5.0
3,"November 19, 2018","Allison was super helpful, enthusiastic, and it doesn't hurt that she's an avid MINI lover/owner as well!  Rob in the finance department was also quite informative, and answered all of my questions in full detail.  Overall, this was an awesome car-buying experience!  I didn't feel pressured into buying, and I drove away VERY happily in the exact MINI I wanted!",5.0

6,"October 05, 2018","Simply put: When I leased my new Countryman in September, 2018, I was astonished at the level of customer service I experienced. Holly Bell, Albie Burch and especially Rob Silva. All of them were fantastic and obviously have gone through rigorous CS training and it shows. But, having spent the most time with Rob--between choosing my car, learning the tech and handling several follow-up issues that were resolved immediately--Rob was more like a brother who knows my car better than I do than a car salesman. Thank you Holly in service, Albie in finance and Rob who maybe needs a better handle than ""sales"" because he's on another level! And thank you Mini for hiring all three of these fantastic people.",4.8
7,"September 26, 2018",I've been buying cars here since 2014. Everyone is friendly courteous and extremely helpful. The service dept is great fast and reliable service . Sales dept Rob Silva is my go to rep. He's knowledgeable and zero pressure sales his expertise is second to none. The entire process from start to finish is was seamless. They definitely have earned my business after all these years.,5.0
8,"September 17, 2018","I had the best experience at MINI of San Antonio. My Motoring Advisor Allison helped me find the perfect car for me. Not only did she help me find the perfect car for me, but was very knowledgeable about the brand on the features of the car. She made me feel like family and that's what it should be all about. I would highly recommend her to anyone that's looking to purchase a MINI.",5.0
9,"September 13, 2018","My mother needed a new car and we went to Mini dealership, Roberto took his time to explain everything slow and clear so my mom, so she can understand! He went out of his way to make us feel super comfortable and secure about our purchase! Thank you so much!!",5.0
10,"March 31, 2016","I purchased my last car in 2012 and it was not a pleasant experience.  The salesman was very nice but in hindsight I regretted purchasing the car.  So, I was a bit apprehensive going into this especially since this was my first time ever purchasing a MINI.  This time around, my experience was nothing but wonderful from beginning to end mostly because of Rob Silva.  He was incredibly patient as I test drove 6 different vehicles to absolutely make sure I was choosing the right one.  He was extremely knowledgeable about the MINI and could answer all of my questions.  Another big difference with Rob is that he wasn't pushy at all! He let me take my time, didn't push me to make a decision quickly which made me feel like I wasn't be rushed into something.  I'm so happy with my new MINI! ",5.0
11,"February 01, 2016","I visited Mini of San Antonio and the pleasure of being assisted by Rob Silva.  I was impressed by his
professionalism and knowledge about all the types and make of the Mini Cooper that I came home
with a brand new MINI COOPER!.  I gave him my cell phone number and he contacted me the very
next day and asked me if I needed help or questions about the car to call him anytime night or day.
That is what I call DEDICATION AND COMMITMENT TO CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.  I recently contacted him about other stuff and he got back to me in less than 5-minutes for the answer.
Thank you Rob because of you I shall recommend anyone I know to get a Cooper and look for you.

13,"January 21, 2016","BEWARE!! This place will rip you off!! I took my car in and got a courtesy vehicle to drive while they had my car. When driving it, for no apparent reason, the windshield cracked in the bottom right corner. I took the car back and told them what happened. After looking on-line, I found that there were complaints about the Mini Countryman windshields cracking for no apparent reason...some time frames were as short as the car being only a month old. They told me the cost of the windshield was over $500 and then they were also charging me about $150 for the rain sensor. The final cost that they are charging me is over $1000.00!! When doing research, I called Mini of Austin & another Mini dealership and the exact windshield(I had to give them the last 7 digits of the VIN #) was $300 and they said THE RAIN SENSOR WAS INCLUDED! They aren't just concerned about getting the car fixed they want to make a profit off of that and are adding another almost $400 to it! I called and left a message with the GM, of course he didn't call back. He had the director of service call and he didn't give a crap. He basically said ""too bad"". They aren't just concerned about getting the car fixed they want to rip people off however they can!
A previous instance, I took my car to get the brakes fixed. I took it the day after the brake light came on. The service guy calls me and says that the car needs rotors, also. I explained that it shouldn't and that I brought it as soon as the light came on. I told him I was going to take it somewhere else. He tells me to hold on and comes back and says he was mistaken that it didn't need rotors. He also told me I was getting a great deal that they were normally $500 for the front brakes, but they are on special for half off. Well, after researching it, I saw on other mini sites that the cost to fix the front brakes are $275 and they were on special $149. I am going to buy a new BMW in the next few months and it won't be from this dealership. I won't be back...I don't care how far I have to drive!

14,"August 30, 2015","Our experience with Sarah Kitchen was superb. She guided us through every step of the process when we ordered our MINI. Nothing but good things to say about her and her professionalism. I would go back to her again. Our custom ordered car was explained in detail to us by Sarah. Upon delivery, Sarah was right there with us to make sure all was good. ",5.0
15,"August 28, 2015","We purchased our Mini about three months and we’ve have been extremely happy with our Countryman. My wife has always loved the style of the Mini; and with hesitation from myself, she convinced me to walk through the dealership while we were in the area. We were immediately greeted by Sarah Kitchen who was very friendly and knowledgeable about the vehicle and different options available. After going back and forth with my wife we decided to pull the trigger on a white Countryman S. I was very surprised with how fun the vehicle is to drive.

One thing I love about the dealership is that it offers free carwashes anytime you are in the area which is great! But, in my opinion the best part of the experience was the customer service we received from Sarah. She thoroughly showed the ins and outs of the vehicle and didn’t complain once when she had to move probably like 10 cars out of the way to bring us the vehicle with the options we wanted. Furthermore, we traded in a vehicle and have been waiting for the title of that vehicle from Maryland, and I had several inquiries throughout the process. Throughout these 3 months (Yes, Maryland is that SLOW) Sarah has graciously answered all my questions promptly and professionally. If you’re considering a Mini, Sarah is GREAT to work with!

Sincerely,
Mini is FUN to DRIVE

16,"August 28, 2015","I have been putting off buying a car for a LONG time because, honestly, it's a pain.  It feels predatory and dirty and I had zero good experience with it... that is before going to MINI and working with Sarah.  She was friendly, kind, empathetic, and didn't give any of the stereotypical sleeze that is associated with buying cars.  No joke, if it weren't for her, I'd still be driving my old car and toughing it out through the annoyance.  If you hate the feel of the car-buying experience and don't want to feel like you're getting hung out to dry, she's the best.  It's like hanging out with your best friend and also taking home a new car. ",5.0
17,"April 21, 2015","My car has been here for 3 weeks, and not once have I received an update or a call, to tell me once what was the plan of action.I have called many days leaving voice mails and still have not gotten a return call except from Allie Cook to see if any action has been done. Aside from Allie this dealership is the least customer service oriented that I have every seen and been a part of as a customer.",1.0
18,"September 24, 2014","I just purchased my second Mini in two years. Rob Silva has made each experience painless. I tell him what I want and he makes it happen.  Everyone at Mini of SA is always ready to help, whether it be basic maintenance or getting a tire replaced (invest in the run flat tire warranty). My best friend has also purchased two Minis from Rob Silva. Again, he makes the process painless. I've never enjoyed the entire car-buying process until I bought my Mini.",5.0
19,"July 28, 2014","I have bought and owned many cars, but I have never had such an amazing experience!  From Sarah Kitchen, my motoring advisor to Jeff Wallace, the Sales Manager, the whole team made me feel at home and I knew I was making the right decision to buy a MINI.  Sarah was not phased at doing my test drives with the top down in the middle of December.  When I decided to custom-order my MINI, Jeff made it happen much more quickly than I had expected.  

The service after the purchase has been great and they have given me personalized attention. I have never had a sales person or sales manager who kept in touch with me after the sale, but both Sarah and Jeff have been there to answer my questions and any concerns I may have. When I got seriously ill, they even offered to pick up my car for servicing. Top-notch service. I cannot recommend them highly enough. You won't be disappointed!  I cannot imagine buying my next car from anyone else!!!",5.0
20,"July 27, 2014","I have purchased 2 new Mini Coopers in the last couple of years.  I bought one for myself and then later bought one for my granddaughter.  The sales experience I received each time was absolutely excellent.  I dealt directly with Jeff Wallace each time and he went out of his way to carefully explain all aspects of the sale.  Each time when we had reached a decision on the car we wanted and agreed to a price, Jeff personally escorted us to the finance department and made sure we were comfortable proceeding with that part of the process.

After the financing was completed, Jeff took us out to the car each time and went over all aspects of the car and made sure we understood how everything worked.  As great as the sales experience was, the Service experience was equally as good.  I am sure that using Jeff as our initial point of contact for the service was a plus but everyone in the service department was great to deal with.  Each time they have done the requested work and have checked to see if any other work was due.  They always advised us of the next service and when it would be due.

For anyone that wants a great deal on a Mini and a pleasant buying experience to contact Jeff or anyone on his staff at Mini of San Antonio.",5.0

22,"July 27, 2014","We recently took our countryman in for some service issues. Tony is our service advisor. When we took it in , he was not available.  We decided to talk to Jeff (sales manager) to get some help. He got us in right away . He had Tony get back in touch with us.  Our car was in for a brake check , and minor mud flap replacement. While in the shop they found an oil leak. They took care of all of our issues right away . After picking our car up, I asked Jeff for some advice about tinting the front window of our car. He got in touch with the tech, and set my appointment up for me . He is always helpful with whatever needs we have whether it be service or sales.  ",5.0

24,"July 27, 2014","I ordered a Mini from Jeff Wallace. Jeff was extremely thorough and patient as ordered unique Mini with many bespoke options. Jeff kept me informed of the status of the car as it progressed down the assembly line. When the Mini arrived, Jeff brought the car to my location and did an excellent job of explaining the Minis features. My Mini even talked to me!!

Jeff has followed up with me periodically and even set my service visits. He has always met me with a big smile and welcomes me back to his dealership!

Thanks Jeff for service above and beyond!",5.0
25,"July 27, 2014","I've had my mini for almost 3 years now and I do a lot of cross country trips (mainly from San Antonio to Chicago). Everyone who works at this Mini dealership will treat you like family and help you out when something comes up. Never fails, I have had a handful of problems with the Chicago dealerships and would hold off any possible work or do a rechecks once I get back to San Antonio. 

I did a special last minute order for snow sleeves in January for my tires because we have been getting hit with a lot of snow and ice in Chicago recently. Jeff Wallace was a little worried on how many sleeves would come in a pack, so he double ordered and did a special request for quick shipping before I started driving back. My stuff came in on time and ready for the snow. Also, had a roof rack and luggage pod installed a year or two before that. I asked the guys if they would mine to show me how to mount, dismount, and care for the pod and racks inside the garage, which they were more than happy to do. 

Also..I am super happy they do inspections on your cars before they take them in for work because once I took my mini in for some work in Chicago. Well, they broke one of my chrome hood decals and wanted to charge me ($300+) to fix something I didn't break. I called Mr. Wallace to ask him for help and said to not worry if they don't fix it, we will take care of you. Out of pure luck, I got a new chrome piece and a free install with the Chicago dealer... The San Antonio guys also warn me when I get new road dings on the hood or pointed out my windshield had a crack, which I would have never noticed. Whenever, something happens to my mini, Jeff Wallace is my go-to person for engine, tires, whatever you name it questions and he always gives me over the top patience and advise on what needs to get done. 

Besides Jeff, the rest of the crew (Ricky, John, and Ben) always make me feel welcome and ask how my family or school is going. 5 stars isn't enough for their service, work, and happiness just working with Minis and their new and returning owners. Hands down, the best dealership I have ever seen or been with. My mom owns a Cadillac and the Mini crew puts her dealership to shame, big time!

I would recommend doing work these guys in a heart beat!",5.0
26,"July 26, 2014","I am the proud owner of my 2nd MINI, both purchased at MINI of SA, I have had excellent customer service throughout the MINI ownership process: building, receiving, & post-purchase follow up.

Jeff Wallace is a competent & committed service provider who goes above and beyond assisting his customers with all of their needs regarding their MINI.

27,"July 26, 2014",I have purchased my second Mini from Mini of San Antonio. The customer service and their knowledge of the vehicles is next to none. They are forthcoming and are people with integrity.  I will be purchasing my next Mini from them. I do consider Mini of San Antonio to be one of the best dealership in the United States. ,5.0
28,"July 26, 2014",The entire staff at Mini of San Antonio went the extra mile to help us in our search for a new car.

31,"May 09, 2014","This has been just about the worst experience my wife and I have ever encountered.  My wife first wanted to purchase a mini back in Feb 2014.  She customized the one she wanted, listed additional accessories and received the price quote.  When she went to get financing at our institution, USAA, they informed us Mini of Austin was the one they had listed as a preferred dealer.  That should have been our first indication that things weren't quite right w/ this place.  After getting her discounts from USAA, she liked the final price and emailed her specifications to the Sales team of Mike and Jeff Wallace of Mini of San Antonio. Everything was rolling just right until we received the car and they did not have the additional accessories she ordered.  Jeff and Mike told her not to worry they would call her to let her know when the parts came in.  No call was ever received.  After about a week of waiting my wife called and guess what???  The parts just happened to magically arrive when she called.  An appointment was set to have them install a roof rack and a roof storage box, replace a BMW sunshade (not the mini one my wife ordered) that was placed in the trunk, and a rear boot cover.  I brought the vehicle in and waited for the installation.  When the technicians finished I asked about the mini sunshade and rear boot and they went over to ask Mike.  Mike informed me that the sunshade would have to be ordered as well as the rear boot cover.  He stated that they had mistakenly given my wife a rear boot mat instead of the cover, so he took the mat out of the rear compartment and went away with it.  First thing I noticed was my wife had chosen a weird color for the roof box.  It was silver.  Our car is silver and black but it just didn't seem to flow w/ the car but I took it home anyway.  I really didn't know too much about what my wife purchased cause this was her car, she built it the way she wanted it so I let her run with it.  When she saw the box she stated that was not the color she ordered.  She ordered a black one, which looks and flows a lot better.  I then told her about the mix up w/ the rear boot cover and the rear mat and she stated she purchased the rear boot mat as well and showed me the build list.  She called the dealership and spoke w/ Jeff Wallace.  He was the one who placed her order.  She told him about the box being the wrong color, the sunshade being the wrong one, and the rear boot mat being taken from our car and right away Jeff begins with the excuses.  He couldn't chose an option on the box color, he stated we didn't purchase the mat when it is clearly listed on the itemized list w/ the price we paid, and said nothing about the sunshade.  He then tried to pass off the blame on my wife stating she did not specify a color for the box.  She emailed a picture of her build to the dealership and it's clearly black.  He then stated the parts department ordered the wrong part, then tried to pass the blame onto the technicians who have absolutely nothing to do with this ordering process. (I was a Ford Senior Master Technician in a former life). Never once did he take responsibility, never once did he apologize for the inconvenience, never once did he show show any inkling of being customer service oriented.  He just wanted to pass the blame off on others and be done with it.  That night my wife and I decided to do any inventory of everything we ordered and found that we were missing a piece for the flat load rear floor, our front floor mats were the wrong ones (she ordered the Cooper S ones).  When she called back to see if the rear boot (once again she had to initiate the call and it was magically in again) and the right colored roof box had arrived, she also informed them about the missing piece in the back and the mats (including the rear boot mat Mike took out from our rear hatch). Jeff stated for her to drop off the vehicle to have the box replaced (it magically arrived again w/ no call from the Sales team) and they would get what she needed.  They said she could drop off the vehicle, they would have a vehicle there she could drive until they were done.  They set up a 8:00 appt and everything sounded easy enough...wrong.  My wife shows up, Jeff Wallace is on the late shift...he's not there.  He left no instructions to anybody about my wife's wrong parts or the rental she needs in order for her to get to the University. No communication...no courtesy...no customer service...NO LEADERSHIP.  The service guy who was on duty made things happen, he got my wife a car to drive and took care of what he could with his limited/non existent information that was passed on.  At least he did try and made things happen.  When my wife goes to pick up the vehicle, she told me that Jeff is just avoiding her...mind you this is a small shop.  When she gets the car back the roof box is the right color (check), the rear boot mat is in there (check), the sunshade would have to be ordered again (unsat) and there is no rear boot cover (unseat).  She asks the salesman who helped her in the morning (Jeff is avoiding her mind you) about the rear boot cover and he of course doesn't know anything about it but says he will find out.  At least this guy is trying.  Jeff than walks up and says to my wife he thought she already had it.  She said she did not and he goes to parts and checks and it's there.  He places it in the car and once again no apologies, no ""Is there anything more we can do for you""...nothing.  Just a lack of courtesy, customer service, and responsibility again.  My wife told him not to worry about the sunshade...she no longer wanted it and would like to be refunded the $60.  Jeff said ok.  She also stated she wanted the back piece for the flat load floor.  He stated that was no longer being given.  My wife told him that it is in the picture for the flat load floor on the website and she wanted what she ordered and showed him a picture of it on the website.  He said he would try to find one and he did and gave it to my wife.  A few days passed and she had not received any word on the refund so once again she initiated the call.  Jeff stated he would have to ask his boss about it as they had ""given"" us that back piece and they ate the price of it ($239) and they had given us upgraded front mats.  He then went on to say to my wife in a very condescending tone ""As I have explained to you before that back piece was no longer being given"" and he stated again ""As I have already explained to you that website picture was old"".  He wife told him that they should update that website so that people know it is not a part of the flat rear floor upgrade.  She also asked for his Boss's phone number.  We came to the conclusion that Jeff Wallace is just an excuse maker.  He is extremely unknowledgeable of the products Mini offers and he is the Sales Manager.  He is unprofessional and lacks the characteristics of an informed manager.  He passes the blame unto those under him and fails to take any responsibility for the actions of his sales team.  Never once did he apologize for the inconvenience of my wife, who had to basically prove that she ordered the parts and then to receive them, was just like pulling teeth. She had to do his job...she had to check and make sure she received what we paid for.  We are not asking for anything free or extra.  We just want what we paid for...we want our items to be correct. I stat too much to ask in this day and age???  Jeff Wallace fails to communicate to his fellow associates and just shows a general lack of interest in ensuring a great experience for a new Mini Cooper customer.  He failed at communicating with my wife on numerous occasions by not calling her to let her know any updates on parts or refunds or just to make sure that things were being taken care of correctly.     
Be warned that as a new customer, once you fork over your cash at Mini Cooper of San Antonio the customer service ends!!  When we pay $35,000+ for a car, you expect things to be right...you expect to get what you ordered...what you paid for.  As the manager of a sales team, a competent or concerned leader should want to make sure that what the customer ordered is correct.  Where is the quality control in this place?  How can they remove something from a customer's vehicle without making absolutely sure that what they are doing is correct (our rear mat)??  My wife basically sold herself the car...we should have been the world's easiest customer.  They didn't have to sell anything...we gave it to them...all on paper...with pictures...and they still managed to get it wrong.  We told them what they needed to do to fix it and they still managed to mess that up and give excuses all along the way. That is a study of incompetence...that is the mark of failed leadership...that is Mini Cooper of San Antonio. No wonder people would rather drive all the way up to Austin instead of deal with these morons, specifically talking about Jeff Wallace.  I wish people could do all my work for me correctly and I could mess it all up and have no repercussions placed upon me.  I'd rather be viewed as competent though. oh...and the refund issue was solved when we called Jeff's boss and left a message with him.  We received a call about 10 minutes later stating the refund for the sun shade would be credited back.  Then Mini of SA has the nerve to call us and ask us to notify them if we give them anything less than a ""10""rating on our CSI (Customer Satisfaction Index) survey so they can discuss with us why they deserve a ""10"". We have a meeting with the General Manager to discuss our displeasure with our purchase tomorrow.  We our going to explain to him the reason we are going to burn them on that survery is due to the incompetence of Jeff Wallace.  Leadership and responsibility should go from top-down. In my eyes he is responsible for everything that went wrong with this transaction.  He had the ability to make it better but instead he just buried himself deeper.  I want his GM to know this is the type of leader he has as his sales manager.  What outcome do I expect...nothing really  but we can't just sit there and be quiet about this.  We have to let him know and we want to let you know...stay away from Mini Cooper of San Antonio...stay away from Jeff Wallace...he is a black hole of idiocy...he'll suck you in if you get too close.  Be warned.",1.0
32,"April 11, 2014","Mini of San Antonio mislead me on the type of deal that I was selecting.  I came in to LEASE a new 2012 Mini Cooper Hardtop taking advantage of a deal that was posted online.  Throughout the deal, the work lease was used consistently to explain my selection.  As I find out now, they used their ""Owners Choice"" program to complete my deal.  This program has similar terms of a lease, but it is a retail financing program.  I was very upset to learn that the sales associate and financial associates never clarified this during the deal.  I realize, I should do as much research as possible, but I also rely on people to be honest and fair.  When I called in to discuss this, my questions were completely dismissed and I was promised a follow-up call with the sales manager, but never received one.  When I called back (over a month later) to speak with the sales manager, he was not willing to make any amends regarding the problem.",2.0

36,"June 15, 2012","It was my daughter's 16th birthday and I wanted to surprise her with a new 2009 Mini Cooper. Our salesman (Alex) was great, he personally went out of his way to help me surprise my daughter by bringing her new Mini to our favorite restaurant with a big bow on the top of the car. This is where the positive experience ends! The first time my daughter had to bring her car in for her first free service they tried to talk her into buying a special oil additive; not trusting this, she called me and I told her definitely not! This happened numerous times when she would bring her car in for the free service. Once they even tried to charge her for new windshield wipers and when she stated that this was covered under the free warranty, they stated to her, &quot;those are for the standard wipers, these are the ultimate wipers&quot;! Well I'm glad my daughter listened to me over the years, because she laughed and told them, &quot;I don't think so&quot;! Another thing, the service department would always say they would call her when the car was ready to be picked up, but they would never call; she would always have to call them. Then when the car's warranty finally ran out the &quot;brake service&quot; light came on. My daughter called and made an appointment to have a complete diagnostic check done. She brought the car into service and talked to Benjamin. She instructed him not to make any repairs until they called her first. Well, of course they never called her and when she called them they said the car wouldn't be ready until 6:00 PM. When she arrived they told her all the problems with the car and that it was going to cost about $1800 to have everything fixed. They then asked her for authorization to make the repairs. She informed them that she didn't have that kind of money right now and didn't want to put it on a credit card; so she said she would bring the car back at a later date. Well she finally saved the money, made an appointment, and brought her Mini back to the dealer; again they (Benjamin) said he would call her when it was finished. After 5 hours, my daughter called and they said they didn't have the parts for the brake job! I couldn't believe it, a BMW/Mini dealer didn't have the parts for a simple brake job! On top of that, they never called her and told her this. It took 5 hours of the car sitting there at the dealership and then my daughter had to call them! She decided enough was enough; she took the car to &quot;Brake Check&quot; who had the parts and did the brake job in a little under 2 hours. I would not recommend this BMW/Mini dealer to anyone; especially the service department. However, is it worth it to have a pleasant sales experience and then find out that your service experiences will always be a nightmare!",1.8
