2,"June 26, 2020","have been a customer for over 17 yrs.  so disappointed with mb.  first purchase in '03, was 2000 c280.  i actually spent more on repairs than the price of the car.  once totally lost brakes on mopac.  bought second c230 10 yrs ago.  this place so overpriced for repairs.  simply unjustifiable.   spent $2080 yesterday --- did not even wash/clean my car---its a pandemic folks. 

have some compassion ---- give folks a break sometimes.   it'll pay off for you to keep customers, even ones that are not wealthy",2.0

40,"April 28, 2020","This Covid moment in time is hard on all of us, so first I would like to say that I appreciate anyone on the front lines of an essential business, including all of the folks at Mercedes who worked with me. They practiced social distancing and kept the number of customers in the building to a minimum by only taking appointments vs walk-ins.  Customers are asked to wear masks, so prepare accordingly if you are planning to visit the dealership and make sure you call ahead. 

I've always wanted a convertible... I finally made it happen and I could not be happier with the car and my experience working w/Paul Dillman and the rest of the team. Being able to take a long drive through the Texas hill country with the top down on my 2017 C300 convertible is just the medicine me and my husband needed during this time of semi-confinement.  We are fortunate to have employment and the ability to do that in times like these and we are grateful.  Paul kept things succinct (which I prefer) and I never felt pressured. His straightforward communication style eliminated potentially wasted time, and kept human-to-human interaction as minimal as possible.

A big ""thank you!"" to Paul and the rest of the Mercedes of Austin team.  Thanks for giving me something to be excited about! Stay well.  - Allison",5.0

160,"July 31, 2019","Since September, 2011, my husband and I have been dealing with Mercedes-Benz of Austin. First with our 1999 C220, [132,000 miles] then a used 2003 C320, and currently, our best one yet, our 2016, C300. During these years we have never had a bad experience, nor have ever been denied anything less than 100% service perfection; from an entire Bosch brake system to a complete set of tires. This was NOT the case with Mercedes-Benz of Georgetown where we were turned away for a cooling system overheat condition for not having an appointment. 
Mercedes-Benz of Austin lives up to something we've only heard said by Lee Iacocca. ""Sales sells the first [vehicle], service sells the rest "" We thank all employees at Mercedes-Benz of Austin, or should I say, our family?

I was 100%  satisfied with the service Annie Daniel's provided to me. She was so knowledgeable, and prompt.  In fact, two of the things I appreciated were: (1) She offered 3 options for my repairs, and allowed me to decide how I wanted to handle the situation. In my experience, that is very unusual for a service representative, and (2) She kept me updated with everything going with my car in a timely fashion. I never had to call her and ask how things were going. I was not concerned, because I knew that with Annie that my car was in good hands. To her boss, ""She is a Keeper,"" and I hope she is well paid.  

Thanks again Annie!

424,"February 07, 2018","I had a scheduled maintenance visit for my old CLK 350 that did not meet my expectations and lead me to the sales floor. I had a very successful unscheduled visit with Tony Shine from the sales department when it became clear to me that it was time for my ""old"" CLK350 to be ""retired. Tony spent at least 1/2 the day with me answering my questions about leasing options and showing me the best values available at that time. He and Matt Juron made it easy for me to proceed with leasing a 2017 E300 low mileage vehicle in excellent condition that more than met my needs. I was totally surprised to be leaving the showroom by mid-afternoon in my new car. 

The reason for the 4 star rating instead of 5 star relates to my experience with the extraordinary delays and wait times in the service department just to diagnose the then current problem and if I wanted a loaner vehicle I would have to wait another 9 days for an appointment. Since I had already been to the service department a week earlier, and had to then schedule the visit on 1/31, it was clearly now going to be at best a two week period and clearly some miscommunication had occurred about how and when my old CLK would be handled for evaluating an ""engine trouble light"".

At MBOA you’ll always be greeted with a warm smile and a knowledgeable staff ready to help you find your dream car. In my case it was an AMG E43. Stacey worked with me to fine the perfect car for my next ride. You’ll never be pressured to make a snap decision purchase at MBOA.
The entire process of buying a car at MBOA is about you. From the moment you start looking for your vehicle, negotiating price, financing the purchase and getting trained on all the new tech in your car you are never rushed through the process. Everyone is friendly and always willing to answer all of your questions.

Buying your new vehicle is just the beginning. The service department is just as knowledgeable and eager to answer questions and service your car. 
I personally like to just stop by the dealership, check out the new cars and say hello to Stacey and the team. Have a cup of coffee and catch up with everyone, “Family Friendly”.

This is my 4th Mercedes Benz that I purchased from Stacey and the MBOA Team. Every purchase has been an exceptional buying experience!
So what are you waiting for, head down to MBOA look up Stacey and join the family. You won’t be sorry.

I highly recommend that you purchase your next Vehicle from Mercedes Benz of Austin.

P.S. Patrick remember, “Ambient light Red” ?

One note on the sales team.  I am a younger man, 33, and get completely ignored when walking around the showroom.  I presume it’s because the sales people assume I’m just window shopping.  In point of fact, I just completed he AMG driving academy and am considering purchasing either an AMG GTS or GTR in the next couple of months.  If I walk into that showroom again and am ignored, I will purposely buy it from Georgetown or my Houston dealer, because “pretty woman”, etc.   Please pass this along to the sales manager,  there’s a fine line between “keeping your polite distance” and your salespeople profiling based on expectation of commission, everyone should get the same level of respect and engagement from sales.

We have recently purchased a car from Mercedes Benz of Austin (MBOA), the 2017 GLS 450. So far we are very happy with the car and have the most favorable impressions of our experience at MBOA.

We have never owned a Mercedes before, and we are very grateful to our sales consultant, Stacey Olmstead, for helping us to initially settle on the brand and then on the specific model. We appreciated that Stacey was always responsive to our requests for meetings, spent as much time with us we needed, was patient with our indecisiveness, never ever pushy. Stacey showed us different models from different years and in different conditions. She is very knowledgeable, meticulous, and honest. When we expressed interest in a Porsche that happened to be offered by MBOA, Stacey told us as much as she knew about the car, and acknowledged certain things that she didn’t know (but she found out and got back to us the next day with the information).

We also are very grateful to Glenn Mayhugh, who gave two tutorials on the car’s very complex systems and controls. It’s very likely that more will be needed. J Glenn is knowledgeable, patient and does not seem to mind repeating same explanations over and over again.

We hope your service department will be equally professional and efficient.

 

Thank you for excellent service.

523,"September 26, 2017","Michael helped me buy a pre-owned c350. My first Mercedes. There were a couple unforeseen issues he had to do his best with and he handled them as well as anyone could. Thanks Michael.

1. The car I had made an appointment to see and drove 4 hours to see was sold days prior and I wasn't notified until I was in the building. This was upsetting and disappointing. In 2017 I am surprised that a system doesn't notify you when a car that is booked for an appointment is sold. Michael quickly got to work to find me something comparable and did a great job.

2. AFTER I wrote a check for the full amount of the car, it is discovered that there is a mechanical problem and the car will be going to the shop before it even leaves the lot. Not a very ""elite"" look. Again, Michael took very good care of me, and assured me that although unfortunate, that this is not normal and he is going to make sure everything is perfect.

We came from Houston to avoid flooding from Harvey. We had a car full of luggage, 2 kids, and 2 dogs. The employees helped us find a hotel, unpacked our car, then repacked the luggage into another car to take us to the hotel. The excellent service made a difficult situation much easier.

You can wander at your will, and ask questions as you have them. They have good recent model Mercedes out on the lot, including some loaner cars with good discounts that are still current year (ca. 5,000 miles). 

We worked with Anna, and she was fantastic: very professional, courteous, friendly, and interested in helping us find the right car for our situation. We ended up with a 2018 GLC SUV, and are very happy with it. It came down to that versus a 2017 loaner C series sedan (they have several on the lot), but we decided on the SUV since we already have a decent sedan (different brand) that we hope will last a few more years. The whole purchase process was smooth and easy, and explanations about other purchasing opportunities (extended warranty, etc) were of course made but were not done in a high pressure way. Follow up emails after our visits always made us feel cared for but not hassled. I felt like the price we paid was fair for the vehicle we purchased.

He called me later that day, to let me know my car was ready.  He explained exactly what the problem was, and they have hopefully resolved it for good.  My one hesitation in giving a 5-star review is that I had a question about how to turn off the radio so it didn't blare into life every time I started the ignition, and no one around the service area seemed to know how to resolve it.  I thought that was a little weird.  Wade did come back out to the car with me, and figured it out.

607,"April 04, 2017","My family has owned Mercedes vehicles on and off since the late 60's (grandfather). My wife have owned 6 now. 500SL, R320 CDI, S350, S550, GL450, and now an E350 Bluetec. The latest of which is our new-to-us 2013 Mercedes E350 Bluetec. The last 3 we have purchased from Mercedes of Austin and have since been servicing our Mercedes vehicles at Mercedes of Austin as well.

This feedback is regarding our latest purchase of the E350 Bluetec. We came into the dealership to replace a tire which had a flat on our S550. We opted to wait on the service, which was not a scheduled appointment. Because we had no appointment it was going to be a 2-3 hour wait. We were not in a rush and had time to wait.

While waiting we went onto the showroom floor and ran into Fouad Batlouni. I had met Fouad once before when I referred a coworker to MBofAustin for a GL (which he did not purchase). Fouad greeted me, and even remembered my name from our previous brief encounter.

Immediately, Fouad was friendly, honest, and not a typical salesman at all. He was friendly and just made conversation asking how we had been doing. I asked him if he had any diesel E-class vehicles in stock, since we had considered replacing our S-class with a diesel E-class. Fouad showed me their inventory list along with full details of each car. Two E-class vehicles caught my eye, which he was happy to show us. Fouad knew I was not there to purchase a car that day, I was just in to service our S-class. Even still, he was very friendly and helpful, and very open to entertaining our curiosity without being pushy at all. Fouad brought showed us the various vehicles that we were interested in, and one in particular seemed to be a perfect fit. It was a very clean, 1-owner, certified pre-owned, E350 Bluetec. The price was very fair. Fair enough that we did not even want to negotiate. Fouad helped us to get the process started to fill out lending documents and also get the S-class appraised for trade-in. The trade-in offer was far as well, so we did not haggle one bit on any portion of the deal.

Apart from Fouad's kind and friendly manner, the biggest thing I can say is that Fouad's experience of financing far exceeded our expectations. If it were not for Fouad's personal experience in finance side of the business, we would not have gone through with the purchase. In the end, we ended up with a very fair rate on the loan, along with the terms we were looking for and a vehicle we could not have been happier with.

Thank you Fouad Boutlani & Mercedes-Benz of Austin for continuing to exceed our expectations. We will definitely be coming back to you for our next vehicle purchase.",5.0

I told him I was flying in from another state in order to pick up the car so I wanted to make sure no one else bought the car , again allegedly not possible for this car as it was too ""highly sought after"". After this he told me they do not accept checks? Really ? A car dealer doesn't accept certified funds from TD bank .... the manager has to sign off on it himself !
             I knew something was up , so I told him to keep my check until the funds cleared ! This is some sort of discrimination. He asked me if I could wire instead and I said I have no problem doing that.  He also tells me there's additional documents that I would need which he doesn't send me . I have to call again on oct 13th only to find out from the secretary that they cannot sell me the vehicle due to where I live. WHAT? I told you on the 4th I lived in North Carolina .

Not only is he warm, friendly, smart and a good listener, he is also very knowledgable about the product and was never without an answer to my one million questions. His demeanor and attentiveness allayed my anxiety about the whole process and I feel a bit like I have gained a new friend.

I have had the same salesman for 10+ years. I don't remember how many cars I have bought from Ray Terranella, but he has gone out of his way to get me what I want every time. This time, he searched the country for a Mille Miglia Edition SL and had it ready to deliver 2 days after I asked for it. 

Glenn took the time to show me the new features and set up my MBrace account. Glenn Mayhugh knows the ins and outs of these cars better than the engineers who designed them. Don Rollish got me rates better than I expected and had me out the door in my new car in no time.

These guys take all the hassle and anxiety out of car buying. It was more like spending a couple hours with old friends than negotiating for a new car. It's the people that make all the difference.

655,"October 18, 2015","I searched the entire state looking for a Mercedes with specific options and only found two, one at Mercedes of Austin and another in Houston with a “Mercedes” dealership who did their financing through a third party. In other words, not a real Mercedes dealership. As a matter of fact, most of the dealerships I spoke to offered marginal attention and customer service. The local dealerships in Dallas (one of which we’ve purchased a car from in the past), kept sending me back the generic “we will contact you shortly” form in response to my inquiry online, and when we visited them and test drove a vehicle, they were supposed to email us back about our search, but instead we got an email thanking us for our time, and keep them in mind for a future purchase. We were also looking at a top of the line, fully loaded Volvo, and although we thought the Mercedes we were looking for was gorgeous, we had a Volvo and knew their process and the deal I was getting was too good for our practical nature to pass up. 
For one last push for the Mercedes, (my wife’s birthday was this week so I was willing to make the seemingly impossible happen) I contacted Mercedes of Austin. Mercedes of Austin told me they could not give me a quote on a lease over the phone. As much as that may have frustrated my desire to secure the vehicle, I respected that. After dealing with dealerships throughout the state, I could sense by this and the generally stellar reviews on line that they had scruples. I told Bonnie, whom I was speaking with on the phone and who was very courteous and professional that I would come back to them if I couldn’t find another, but if they wanted to get the car off their lot by Saturday, to have someone call me back. This was on a Wednesday. 
Thursday I began speaking with Michael Bakiris. He is excellent and courteous at his craft and he offered to negotiate a lease with me. After a few conversations during the day, and a brief one on Friday, we nailed down a competitive price point. I was extremely grateful to Mr. Bakiris for the opportunity to go from making a lateral Volvo move to getting my wife the Mercedes she really wanted. I booked the flights from Dallas to Austin for the next day. I woke up early Saturday morning and saw that our flight had been cancelled due to maintenance. I panicked and rebooked an earlier flight. Michael said he was going to arrange for a driver pick us up from the airport. When Michael texted me the name of the driver, Brian, and his number, I contacted him and told him our flight was rescheduled and we were there early. He arrived promptly with little notice and courteously drove us to the dealership. I finally was able to meet Michael in person and found him to be very warm and friendly. 
Michael did everything he could to expedite the process just as we requested. He had Patrick Rodriguez, the concierge specialist, show us how to navigate all of the luxury options of the car. He was excellent and it was an experience unlike any we have had in purchasing a car before. When he saw that we had the classic Ipod, he even made sure to exchange the newer cable for the one we needed. Above and beyond. He took us into the store to pick out key chains and our choice of swag. Afterwards he gave us back to Michael who immediately took us into the finance office where we met Don Rollish, the finance lease manager.  He was prepared with all of the paperwork printed and ready to go. He went above and beyond to ensure we were aware of key aspects of a lease. He was extremely informative and the process was clear cut. We signed the papers and Michael introduced us to the Manager of the dealership who thanked us for our business, and off we went in our new car. My wife said she thought that not only was it the most painless experience with a dealership but it was actually quite enjoyable. By the time we returned home we both felt that if we stick with Mercedes in the future, we want to deal with Mercedes of Austin. 
THANK YOU so much Michael Bakiris - for your exceptional customer service, your courtesy and a truly enjoyable opportunity to join the Mercedes family.

He pulled up my information and remembered me and my husband Sam from many years ago. Personalized customer service makes such a hugs difference and Oscar is obviously a valued member of your team! 

Once all my loaner worker was completed,  Oscar introduced me to Chase.
He asked the right question, he never promised me a quick fix, but explained how serious Mercedes Benz takes safety and therefore my car would take top priority.
Larer that same afternoon I received a call from Chase informing me that he had the seatbelt completely replaced. I was delighted and surprised at how quick the whole process was. Thank you to your team.

Service Items Punch List:
I had a windshield wiper nozzle replaced.
Vehicle Inspection
Air replaced with Nitrogen in tires.
Read Drive Flex Disc replaced.
Leaking Valve Cover repaired.

The only thing I was puzzled about when I received the keys to go home was, after starting my E500, the Fill Wiper Fluid Resevoir light came on. 
It was no biggy, I informed the young man and he filled it up right away.

I also like your new means of feedback. The last on I completed was too cumbersome.

Jim could of sold us ocean front property in Arizona, he was that good and very professional. Needless to say both vehicles were emaculate, but my wife fell in love with the 2004.  The Service team had this vehicle so clean that I told Jim he had brought us to the wrong car. It looked brand new. I must say all the vehicles were emaculate.

On the other hand, I have tried to reach salespeople (my husband even talked to one and explained the situation- the salesman told him he would call him back and he never did) and dan boone (because he is the finance guy who handled my lease) at the dealership multiple times to discuss trading in my lease early because of repeated safety issues with my car (suspension has gone out 4 times in less than a year, brake lights constantly going out. The traction control went out while I was driving.  Most recently, after I got my car back from getting the suspension control fixed (for the 4 the time) and the traction control fixed, the check engine light came on 2 days later.

794,"March 08, 2014","I have been going to this dealership for seven years.  We have had our ups and down.  Overall, this tag team is awesome allowing me to obtain the vehicle my wife as myself would enjoy.  My wife really enjoys SUV style type vehicle where W.C. Wright took his time going over both his inventory as well as utilizing his intranet search engine to see if he could fine her a vehicle that would meet her expectations.  

His relentless strive allow us to obtain a vehicle we both would be comfortable and meeting her expectations.  Dan Boone is an awesome advisor assisting me how to proceed forward.  He was able t search a fantastic finance rate as well as guiding thru the paperwork and offerings.   

The day before leaving the dealership, we did stopped by Lexus to view their LX570.  I currently own to other Lexus RX330 and IS250, so familiar with Lexus.  The LX570 is a good truck, but it still reminded me of my Landcrusier that I had until three years ago.  Both company's are great and have true conviction and integrity.  

The turning point came down to who took the extra steps to ensure happiness for our family.  In the end, the team at Mercedes Benz - Austin just takes up several notches up.  People like Glen who takes passion going over your vehicle awareness and its details.  All I have to say, W.C. Wright is not an outsider, but someone you respect and cherish his openness and passion.  Dan Boone how his humor and openness makes you do the right decision in terms of financial direction and outlining pros and con of added packages to ease required maintenance on the vehicle.  

In summary, this is why we selected this dealership in Austin not because of the dealership, (I do have one closer to my home) but because of the team it has and for this, it will always strive to be the best.

Thank you W.C. Right and Dan Boone.

I was very pleasantly surprised...we were greeted in a friendly manner but not pressured in any way. After allowing us to browse around and relax a little, Blake Betts quietly asked if he could help us with anything.

He was always extremely helpful, very knowledgeable, and patient with us as we kept changing our mind about options, etc.  He truly wanted to find for us the exact car we wanted and kept us updated throughout each step of the process.  He thoroughly explained the pricing structure to the point we felt confidant we paid the true market value of the car. 

Upon delivery Blake took plenty of time to show us the features, options, and how to operate the vehicle.  He gave us his personal cell phone number for any and all questions or problems we might have.  

In summary, Mercedes Benz of Austin and Blake worked hard to earn our business and they succeeded.  I was also looking at BMW's and Audi's and the customer service at Mercedes Benz of Austin was far superior to either one.   If you are in the central Texas area and in the market for a Mercedes it would be a mistake to not visit Mercedes Benz of Austin.

839,"May 07, 2013","I wanted to buy an used slk350 either 2009 or 2010 around $40,000. I went twice to test drive an SLK car either used or new and he refused to let me test drive the car that I want to buy. First visit he made me test drive the car that he wanted me to buy or he liked(I don't understand why he did that). He only showed a brand new slk350 priced ridiculously high($68000). second time he said the SLK is parked too far away from his office and told me to fix an appt and come back. I cant believe he let a potential customer to leave that place. So, basically he did not want to do any business with me. I ended up driving to MB of Houston North with my husband to buy my dream car(2010 SLK350 with less than 30000 miles) for 40grand on road.",1.8

841,"January 13, 2012","We are going to MBOA for the 1st time tomorrow. We are new to Austin and new MB owners, so our experience will be unbiased. The customer service over the phone was really good, I think the name was Annie? We recieved a confirmation email for our appointment, which was good as we didn't have to go search for the address to put in our gps. We will let you know how everything went after our appointment tomorrow. Dewayne n Asta",4.0
842,"March 20, 2011","Dan Boone, Chris Hersch, and Danny Boone were all deceptive in their sales practices in my experience and sold me an essentially broken car they claimed to have no knowledge of even though it was a 'pre-existing condition', and to top it off they sold us a bum warranty that did not cover any of the items that were written in its terms. AVOID MB OF AUSTIN, ESPECIALLY CHRIS HERSCH AND DAN BOONE (WHICH YOU CAN NOT SO DON'T GO IN THE FIRST PLACE). ",1.2
843,"January 21, 2011","I have to commend this dealership!! I bought my car 3 years ago, pre-owned, and every bit of the experience was awesome. I wasn't pressured into anything, like something more expensive, I knew what I was in the market for(thanks online research). I felt like a friend more than a customer. The finance guy was cheerful and fun. He made the paperwork process easy and simple. Glenn was waiting for me with my owners manual and new keys. He is the guy that taught me how to use everything in my car. I still call him and stop by his office with questions sometimes. He is always sooo helpful. I love the service department. My service advisor is so sweet. She calls with status updates and lets me know right when its ready. She knows I love my car and hate to be without it. When I decide to wait for my car to be serviced, I am walked to the lounge which has a tv(and the remote). There is a full service coffee bar that makes me a better-than-Starbucks latte. I like to walk around the showroom and look around. The sales guys are so welcoming even though I'm just kicking tires. Even three years later, my sales guy Danny still knows my face and name. I still get Christmas cards from him too! I can't imagine having to take my car to anther dealership. I am treated like a real person and its a great feeling. Thanks everyone! Great job and please...keep up the good work!! ",5.0
844,"December 11, 2010",I came into buy a new car and the experience was everything that I had hoped for. I have been waiting for this day for quite a while and they made it feel like it was just as exciting for them as it was me.  W.C. is so energetic and all about getting me in the right car.  I did not feel pressured in the finance office like I was dreading and once I was ready to roll Glenn taught me everything about my new purchase.  When I had a few minutes of waiting they made me a latte and gave me a pastry.  Before leaving I also learned that every Saturday I can get a free car wash.  I cannot think of better service!,5.0
845,"July 20, 2009","when I called the service dept. to get some infromation on a service I needed for my vehicle, the girl I spoke to was rude and not very knowledgable. Her reason for not knowing the answers to my questions, she said, and I quote ""I dont have a mercedes, so I dont know."" Now I work in customer service so I know that sometimes you dont have the answers to some questions, but instead of asking someone who did, she chose to be resentful and rude.I really did not care if she had one or not, I was calling for information for my vehicle. Now, after I FINALLY got a quote which turned out to be $479.00, and told them that I was going to need a loaner, they basically told me that in addition to paying for the basic service I needed on my car (which was $479.00) plus any additional servicing I may need like checking all my fluids (which I thought comes with any oil change) that I would also have to pay for the gas of the loaner car, and wait five days until a loaner would become available. These people are rude, arrogant, over-priced, and not very helpful, and they are the first people to make me feel bad that I even have a mercedes. I dont know what these people's problem is, but they are really making mercedes look bad. I will go to the next town to get my car serviced, before I let these people lay on my vehicle, nor will I refer any one to this dealership.",1.0
846,"January 06, 2007",All staff at this dealership were very couteous and very focused on the comfort of the customer.  Saleman was very professional and absolutely did not pressure the sale.  Services was great and everyone from sales to the financial people were very accommodating.,5.0
847,"September 28, 2006","The service department never explains the work needed to be done on the vehicle, nor do they call to report progress.  And twice there were grease IN the car when we have it back.

The last straw is when they quoted us over $1000 on engine repairs whereas it was all covered by extended warranty through Mercedes Benz company (verified by Georgetown dealer), and kept on telling us that it was not covered despite our inquiry.

I will never buy a Mercedes in Austin just because the frustration of dealing with this dealer isn't worth it, no matter how good the vehicle is.",1.2
848,"December 29, 2005","I have been taking my car to them for service for over three years. In that time I have spent several thousand dollars. They seldom call to inform the service work is completed or may not be completed on the same day. They seldom have enough cars to handle the number of individuals that need one while the cars are being serviced.  In all the time I have taken my car to be serviced, only twice was I given a Mercedes to drive while my car was being serviced. 
The last time was for a catalytic converted which I had to prepay $1200 for. After waiting for one month with no phone call about the status I called to ask when I would expect to be able to take it in. I was informed that there was a shortage of parts. Another month and still no phone call. No part either. One more month goes by and still no part. Nationwide backorder. No estimate of when if ever I will get one.
Overall their service department stinks. In searching for a new car, I talked to several Lexus owners that are now Lexus owners because of MBofAustin. I will never go back there.",2.2
