9,"October 24, 2019","After several weeks of looking for just the right vehicle my wife and I chose a 2018 Jeep Renegade from Hurst Mitsubishi Autoplex. The vehicle might as well be brand new as it only has less then 10k miles. Fantastic value + a beautiful vehicle = a GREAT deal for us. Our sales person, Trevon, was very professional and a class act. Our credit is not the best and Hurst worked hard to get us financing we can live with. Good job all the way around guys. Highly recommended.",5.0

14,"September 05, 2019","Great car buying experience. Michael was truly. amazing. Purchased my car through Hurst after finding the vehicle I wanted on the internet. From start to finish, Michael ensured that no detail was overlooked. He arranged for, and oversaw, cosmetic detailing, acquiring an additional key and having the vehicle shipped to my home. 

I would definitely recommend Hurst and would buy from them again.

15,"August 29, 2019",Quick and easy. No pressure to buy the vehicle I was looking at.  Breece Higgins  was great and very helpful.  I will recommend him and Autoplex to everyone I know.  ,5.0
16,"August 06, 2019","There was some initial misunderstanding about the features of a vehicle. The Outlander PHEV apparantly doesn't get a lot of attention around here. I was pretty upset about it at first and I felt like it took longer but over all they really did make a lot of effort to help me out and come to a solution where everybody would be happy again. There was no high pressure during sales.  Jonathan Lopez is very personable and did a great job with handling things. Their service department did a lot a legwork in trying to research and to help me learn more about the car.

In the end I'm happy with the car it just had a surprising learning curve that I didn't expect. (It can be driven simply but there's a lot you can do with it). The people here defied my expectations of car sales men and really went above and beyond to help me out.",3.8
17,"July 13, 2019","My family came into the dealership knowing what we needed and Trevon listened to everything and brought us out exactly what we pictured. Being my first car on my own, I was nervous about the process but Trevon was there to help every step of the way with any confusion I had. He was very clear with everything and there was no haggling involved. It was a very simple, easy process and now my family and I get to enjoy this amazing ride! Go see Trevon !",5.0

19,"June 27, 2019","I have to say , my experience with this dealership was amazing. Had a horrible experience at another dealer and ended up giving the car back. I was not only treated amazing but they worked extra hard to get me the car I always wanted and then some. I got a better car, more options and upgraded details all for cheaper than what I was gonna pay for a base model at the other dealer. I went from crying to smiling so big and feeling so happy . Thanks again for all that you did. You all were truly a blessing. And I know I will refer all my friends and family . I will also be a loyal customer for life. What a wonderful experience ",5.0
20,"June 25, 2019","Make a purchase from out of state is not simple, but Trevon and Kevin made the purchase experience easy. Clear communication, fast and accurate responses and ease of transaction was second to none. 

Trevon was there from the beginning to end and was great. Kevin had everything we agreed upon ready to go by the time I got to the dealer.

23,"June 06, 2019","I looked for a vehicle for over 6 months, every place gave me the run around. I called Hurst Auto plex and they helped right away. Ryan Miller and his staff are great guys. We drove from Texarkana to Hurst to make the purchase. There were a few things wrong with the Durango when we test drove it. They didn't hesitate one time to not try to fix what was wrong. Things couldn't be fixed that day since it was a holiday so Ryan offered for us to go home and they would deliver the car to Texarkana. A+ in my books for that. I would recommend this dealership to anyone that is looking. Thanks guys from staff that was working that day to making us feel comfortable as we waited,  to the Manger that made everything correct. By far the best experience!!!",5.0
24,"June 06, 2019","I purchased my first car from Breece on Tuesday, and I can’t say enough good things about him or Hurst Autoplex. My husband and I bumped into Breece on Sunday by accident, and even on his day off he still took the time to help us out. Fantastic customer service!

Breece was awesome to deal with when purchasing my first car. My husband and I actually ran into him on a Sunday when we were looking at the Ford Explorer they had for sale. Breece was loading up a vehicle on his trailer to go deliver it to another customer, but stopped what he was doing and took the time to get us the keys so we can view inside the car (we didn’t request to view the car and didn’t expect to on a Sunday – but him going out of the way really showed the passion he had for customer service). We had planned to go view four or five more Explorer’s after visiting this location, but decided against it. We were both pretty sold on this Explorer.

I applied for financing online on Monday for the Explorer, and Hurst Autoplex made the whole process so easy! My husband had called them, and was able to work with them over the phone about the financing and made sure I got a pretty good deal with low interest rates. I don’t have the best credit, but I was truly impressed by how low my interest rate was and couldn’t have been happier. 

When we went in on Tuesday it was the easiest transaction I had ever made in my life. We walked in and Breece was there to meet us. We walked to his office and were in there for about fifteen/twenty minutes. Once they had my folder put together we walked over to the financing center, and waited an additional five/ten minutes before Giorge met with us. 

Giorge is one of the nicest people you will ever meet. He took the time to go over everything with us, and answered all of my quirky questions I had about financing. Handing over my trade-in (title in hand) and signing for a new car was smooth, quick, and easy. They did add in a leather package thing, but that was standard and I didn’t mind having it. We were done in about 10 minutes!

After signing for the new car Giorge walked us back over to the sales center, and Breece handed us the keys to my new Ford Explorer Limited! Breece took the time to go over the car with us, and show us all the bells and whistles it had. He and my husband had a fun time learning how to flip the back seats, and just basically going over everything. It was nice to have someone go the extra mile to make sure we were comfortable with our new car, and didn’t just wave us goodbye and not care after I bought the car.

I had heard horror stories about car dealerships, but none of those horror stories happened here. This was a no bull dealership, and we will definitely come back here to purchase another vehicle for my husband in the future. Highly recommend!",5.0

36,"April 26, 2019","Arrived a few hours before close of business on a friday.

Trevon was ready for us as soon as we arrived, test driving it within 10 minutes of arrival.  Very friendly.  Allowed us to determine the route of the test drive without restriction, while also recognizing when my son (the driver) was seeking guidance on suggested return routes via nonverbal hints.  (IE Trevon is quite good at reading people and being ready to offer help at just the right moment, coming off as well prepared, relaxed, and definitely not pushy.  A good choice for a first time buyer which was part of what I was hoping to impart to my son from this experience).

We were 3rd in line for the finance guy, but as we were paying via lump sum, they found a way to accomplish the final details with additional staff to negate waiting for the other two financing ahead of us.

Literally in and out in our only visit in less than an hour and a half.

Let me also say that the my sales rep Jeremy and the management team there are outstanding as well and had mentioned me to take my truck to Hurst Autoplex as they have all the necessary equipment to check the my list of items regarding the lift and their team would take care of me. Well, Nathan Hausser greeted me upon my visit and as I gave him my information and my ""list"" of things that needed to be done; Nathan was attentive, listened to all my concerns and gave me the assurance that everything would be looked at in detail and assured me that they would take care of me. I was completely surprised by not only the attention and assurance to my concerns, but at the time the technician was working on my truck, Scott had come out and went over in detail what my concerns were specifically and covered all items of exactly what he had done. Scott was very attentive to my concerns as well and answered all my questions completely.

He's not at all pushy, asks pertinent questions and is an excellent conversationalist.  I cannot recall a time that I ever was so relaxed during an automobile transaction.  One unique item to point out is that Hurst Autoplex deals with a substantial amount of very high dollar sports cars as well as ""lifted"" trucks....vehicles with very high price tags.  Our little purchase seemed to pale in comparison.  But Chris treated us and our sale with the utmost respect and attention to detail...something we truly appreciated.

Chris took us into his office, made us comfortable and went and got the Outlander, pulled it right up front, showed it to us and allowed us to test drive it. We questioned the color so Chris took all the time we needed to show us other Outlanders with the same equipment we wanted in different colors. We eventually stayed with our first choice. Chris got us into our new Outlander in minimal time and at the price we were looking for. I would recommend Chris and Hurstautoplex to anyone looking for a new or used vehicle.

188,"February 19, 2015","My Daughter recently purchased a 2015 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport at Hurst Autoplex Mitsubishi in Hurst, Texas. The entire process was painless! The moment we were approached on the lot by Chris Cunningham, we both felt an honesty comfort from him. He did not push, pull or yank us around to buy from him.  He made arrangements to let her drive the car for 24hrs so that we could make sure she felt 100% safe to drive the vehicle she was looking to purchase.

We let Chris know that our main goal was to have the SUV purchased under my daughter’s name only and the need to get the lowest possible purchase price and interest rate possible. Chris, the owner Jim and staff made ALL this happen for her. 

Chris was on the ball, knew what he needed to do, and was there to help us, NOT JUST SELL A CAR! They day of purchase, Chris had us in and out within 1hr of completing the credit application (including the cleaning prep time for the vehicle). The owner spent time with my daughter educating her on what she should be doing now and in the future to help improve her credit score even more. Rick in financing helped explain what the different financing options/add-ons were and how they worked and if she should or should not get them. There was another gentleman that we had interactions with, but I have forgotten his name and I apologize.

Thank you Hurst Autoplex Mitsubishi for the excellent service. And THANK YOU Chris for not only the service you gave us during this process, but your service to the United States of America!

To whom it may concern,

I highly recommend Hurst Autoplex Mitsubishi for your car buying needs! These folks know how to treat their customers with both professionalism and courtesy. They are 100% family owned and when you walk through their door, you are treated like one of the family! Once you purchase a vehicle from this group, you do become part of this auto family and they treat you like it! I had the pleasure of dealing with John Daly, the Finance Manager on the telephone who helped set up my appointment and explained the loan process to me and was able to answer all of my questions I had over the phone. When I arrived for my appointment, I then met with John Curry, Sales Consultant who helped me with my entire car buying experience, helped me with my paperwork and put me in the exact vehicle that I needed and wanted! It was a great experience - the most easiest car buying experience I have ever been through! Way to go John Curry and he was so nice and professional and he knows his brand - Mitsubishi, which was very important to me!! Next, I met with Rick Massey, Sales Manager to finalize my vehicle purchase and sign my finance paperwork. Finance went very smoothly and Rick even got me a better finance rate through another bank! That was awesome, and I appreciate that! My overall experience with this dealership was 5 stars for sure! I have purchased both new and used cars in the past in my lifetime, and I have never had this type of experience before. As a woman, I felt comfortable and not pressured and at ease through the whole buying process. Again, I recommend Hurst Autoplex Mitsubishi for your car buying needs! You won't be disappointed.

We were needing to know before we came in if we could even afford the payment before test driving and deciding on a specific model or color.  I put my application in online and received a call from Kevin Sparger about 20 minutes later.  We discussed what our needs were and what our budget would be, and I asked if he could give me an estimate on the monthly payments.  Kevin was more than happy to accomodate me, he actually gave me estimatess on both a 2014 Lancer and a 2014 Mirage, per my request.  He calle dme back and gave me the figures and we were very pleased with the outcome, so my wife and I told him we'd meet him Saturday morning at 9 when he got there to look at the cars and test drive them.  When Kevin came in it was less than 5 minutes and we were on the road test driving.  When we returned to the dealership, we told Kevin what we wanted as far as the payment, and if he could get it in under that line we'd buy the vehicle then and there.  Not only did he get us in that range he suggested running my wofe's credit as well to see if we could get a lower interest rate.  I had not thought of this before, but when he did that it knocked 3.5% off of the interest which allowed us to be able to get GAP insurance and still be under our required payment.  Kevin was on the ball, knew what he needed to do, and was there to help us, NOT JUST SELL A CAR...

Hurst has a 90 day/3K Mile warranty on their used vehicles.  Little did we know we were going to need it.  After being back in Shreveport a few days, the truck stalled out on us twice.  We called Breece and he assured us we would be taken care of.  We made arrangements through Breece for the truck to be repaired at a Dodge dealership here in Shreveport.  We took it in, got it repaired at no cost to us!!  It is working fine right now.  WE ARE HAPPY CAMPERS!!

John Daly was super friendly and not in the least bit ""pushy"" or intimidating.  I have to mention that we visited 3 other dealerships this same day.  We were exhausted by 11:00 at night (when we left the last dealership) to say the least!  NONE of the other dealerships were even near as awesome as Hurst Autoplex Mitsubishi.  

John and Rick texted and phoned a few times with dollar figures they had run and found us the absolute best deal we were offered from anywhere we looked.  We purchased TWO Mitsubishi Outlanders because they are such wonderful vehicles.  This is crazy because I was only in my trade in for 1 1/2 years!  I traded WAY up in terms of features and was even able to cut my negative equity substantially due to the rebates that were available on the Mitsubishi.  

I was also very impressed with the finalization of the buying process.  With every vehicle I have ever purchased, the ""paper-signing"" was a long, drawn out process with pretty hard sell finance employees.  We were offered extended warranties and gap insurance and when we stated what we wanted the reply was ""okay...sign here and here"".  

This was the best car purchasing experience I have ever had.  There never was any pressure whatsoever to purchase more than we needed or wanted and no haggling over price or payments.  We explained going in what we felt we could afford and they made it happen!  

I HIGHLY recommend this dealership and of course, John Daly since he was our salesman but the other gentlemen in the showroom were all very friendly, stopping by and greeting us then congratulating us after our purchases.  Not to mention the outstanding vehicles Mitsubishi has available.  They had lots of variety on their lot and when the model and color that I wanted was not available, they never tried to get me to settle for anything else.  John Daly said, okay, we don't have this one here but we will go get it.  Amazing!  

I love these guys!

Breece was my salesman that I dealed with and he was very professional with a laid back personality and no pressure was put on me the whole time I was there. The car I liked was more than I was pre approved for and at that time Breece introduced me to Rick. Rick was able to get me into the car with different financing and saved me 2% on my APR. All of the time time I dealt with Rick and Breece there was no pressure to purchase any kind of extra insurance or packages, in fact I had to bring some things up that I wanted to add on. This was the easiest time I have had purchasing a car . They were able to get me what I wanted at a fantastic price.",5.0
221,"December 14, 2013","I had a great buying experience with Hurst Autoplex. Breece Higgins was the type of salesman everyone should have the pleasure of buying from! I highly recommend dealing with Breece. It was a smooth transaction with a friendly guy who promptly answers you questions and does not pressure you. 

Once we had made the purchase with Breece, we finished financial paperwork Kevin Sparger, the finance Manager. This is the part of the car purchase that generally takes a while leaving you feeling like you are being held hostage. At Hurst Autoplex it took just a few minutes. No pressure to add on extended warranties, service agreements or other nonsense intended to wiggle a few more bucks out of you like at other dealerships. It was just simple straightforward transaction. 

I comparison shopped with another Mitsubishi dealership in Irving, but the Irving dealership was not timely about returning calls/emails and getting answers was like pulling teeth and left me wondering what they were trying to hide. Not Hurst Autoplex. Breece always answered all my questions quickly, and completely. I never felt like he was playing games or hiding anything. Everything was straightforward. No games, no surprises, no hassle. The process was easy.  


When the kids start driving, we will definitely shop here first!",5.0
222,"December 09, 2013","This was our daughter's first car buying experience. John treated her with respect and took time to walk her through the process. When it was time to take care of the finance paper work, Kevin was patient and made sure she knew what each number meant. We were so impressed with the way our daughter was treated that we decided to buy a car also. We called John and told him of our desire to buy a Mirage like our daughter's. When we arrived at the dealer John was busy with another customer, so Rick (sales manager) took care of us until John was available. He treated us with the same professionalism and courtesy as was shown to our daughter through the entire experience. Of all the car buying experiences we have had in the past, this was the by far the best.",5.0
223,"November 30, 2013","After reading the excellent reviews on Hurst Autoplex Mitsubishi, my family and I decided to make the drive from Rockwall to Hurst yesterday morning to ""possibly"" buy a new Mitsubishi Outlander. The reviews were very accurate. I don't think I have had a more pleasant dealership experience. 

First, Mr. Breece Higgins called me on the phone while we were on I-30, told me that he had read my e-mail and would pull out the SUV I have chosen to look at immediately. That was it! He did not try to get any more information or prolong the phone conversation unnecessarily, which has always been a big turn-off for me with past dealerships (and therefore made me very hesitant to leave my phone number in any dealership).

Once we got to the dealership, we noticed a couple of customers walking around and looking at cars. The atmosphere was very relaxed. The staff inside were very friendly, courteous, and professional. Mr. Higgins treated us very well. His presentation of the SUV was concise, but answered accurately whatever questions we had. He made us feel very welcome and relaxed. When it was time to fill out paperwork -- and at this point I was very surprised and pleased that we were just ""now"" having to fill out ""any"" paper, as opposed to past experiences -- Mr. Higgins was very patient and accommodating.

As I was transferred from Mr. Higgins' office to Mr. Kevin Sparger's office for financing, the staff greeted me and were asking a few personal questions as if I were a family guest. Mr. Sparger was just as friendly and professional. From what I have observed, they really looked like a big family and worked as a team. That was important to me because I was purchasing the 7-seater SUV for my parents and four (4) younger siblings. I did not want to end up at a dealership that only saw me and my family as customers for that day, but one that would go above and beyond to make sure we would become lifetime customers. Even though Hurst Autoplex Mitsubishi is almost 50 miles from where we live, I can't imagine going anywhere else for future vehicle purchases. They definitely deserve five (5) stars, and much more, customer loyalty.",5.0
224,"November 24, 2013","Sales consultant, finance manager and General Manager were all very very nice and they expedited the whole process.  The price of the new car versus trade in was great.  Extra services like pulling the safety features up were appreciated too.  everyone in the dealership worked together...and it was noted.  I will recommend you to others! Thanks for making my daughters 1st purchase wonderful.  ",5.0
225,"November 21, 2013",The purchase of my new Outlander was a pleasant experience. The staff was friendly and knowlegable of vehicle and programs.  There was no haggling over pricing.  I would recommend this Family Owned dealership to anyone!,5.0
226,"October 31, 2013","This was the most pleasurable experience I ever had purchasing a car.  I have purchased a few over the last 35 years.  They listened to what I wanted and found me the perfect SUV at a great price.  They also found a great lender with a very low interest rate for a used SUV with very low miles 11,000 and a one owner before me. That was exactly what I wanted. I would recommend you to contact them for any car,suv or truck your interested in, They will find it for you at a great price.      Thank You, everyone at Hurst AutoPlex Mitsubishi  !!!",5.0
227,"October 17, 2013","If you are looking for a new or preowned vehicle there is no other place I would go. The customer service was great from start to finish.  They treated me with courtesy and respect, and I received a great deal.  Thank you guys for all your hard work I will definitely be a customer for life.",5.0
228,"September 27, 2013","The reason I gave the ratings I did is because Nathan has been my Service Manager for 13 years and I followed him to this new Hurst dealership. He's honest, friendly, courteous, always smiling and very helpful. As a single lady, it is wonderful to have someone like Nathan I can trust with my vehicle. As a mechanic's daughter, I'm aware that not all dealerships have people who are honest or care about their customers! I've always had great trust, belief and gratitude towards Nathan. He's the best I've known in this business. He has always known what was going on with my car and kept me in tune with that. This dealership has a real gem of a Service Manager in Nathan and I will be a customer here for as long as I have this car and Nathan is there to make sure everything goes right with the service I receive. I ONLY trust Nathan and will ONLY let him help me with my car needs. 
Thank you Nathan for always telling me the truth and for being concerned about my car and for me being out on the road. You've saved me many a time from having something happen when you have prevented things in the past! I look forward to taking this car to 300,000 and more miles with your help and guidance!!!  Many Blessings at the new dealership!!! ",5.0
229,"September 26, 2013","If you would like to work with an honest service advisor look no further than Nathan Hausser. My Eclipse is 11 years old and is approaching 200,000 miles. Nathan is the only service advisor this car has ever seen.Thanks to Nathan and his skilled team of service techs this car looks and runs like the first day I purchased it. Nathan will never try and sell you a service you do not need and your safety is his top priority. I highly recommend Nathan!!",5.0
230,"September 25, 2013",From the initial contact Breece and the entire Hurst autoplex team were very informative and helpful in trying to help me find the right fit for me. There was not pressure involved and I fell that they did everything possible to give me the best deal they could on both my trade-in and my new car lease. This was a very enjoyable and non-stressful experience. I highly recommend Breece Higgins and the entire Hurst Autoplex team to help with your new or used car needs.,5.0
231,"September 25, 2013","Breece was great to work with. I felt like I got great service and a really good deal on my car. What was very nice, and what ended up selling the car, was that I got to keep the Mitsubishi Outlander for a little while. I was leaning towards buying a Ford  Explorer, but when I drove the Mitsubishi I realized what a good fit it was for my family. Mitsubishi provides a much better warranty and a lot of technology for the money. The 2014 Outlander is an excellent car. Thanks for all the great service, Breece, and for the personable but no pressure sales technique. It makes me want to keep doing business with you!

233,"September 04, 2013",This is the second Mitsubishi I have purchased from them in the last five months. I received such excellent service the first time I decided to go back and purchase a second vehicle. The sales person was very knowledgeable and really helped me narrow down my needs to a specific vehicle that fit my budget and lifestyle. I would highly recommend Hurst Autoplex to anyone looking for a new vehicle.,5.0
