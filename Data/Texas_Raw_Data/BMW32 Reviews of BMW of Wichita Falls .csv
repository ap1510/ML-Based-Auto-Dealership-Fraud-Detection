Despite my being stationed overseas, he and his team worked with me throughout the order and purchase process, answered all of my questions promptly, and were up-front with the discounts available on the vehicle.

You won't be disappointed!",5.0
10,"December 27, 2017","Dealer tries to add fees after an ""out the door"" price was reached, claiming doc/dealer fees are required by state law.  Not true, in fact, state law requires that dealer post an advisement that such fees are negotiable.  ",1.0
11,"April 03, 2017",This was the easiest lease process ever. I called Chris Emery and told him what I was looking for and he made it happen. I couldn't be happier with the whole process. The financing department was super efficient as well. This is what I expect from my car family. I won't lease from anyone else. ,5.0
12,"March 20, 2017","Chris Emery was a major influence in our purchase of this vehicle. From alerting my husband to the availability of the Lexus RX 450, his cheerful assistance with test driving, and his excellent tutoring on  the bells and whistles with infinite patience, Chris has been a tremendous help to me.

Chris Lunsford had all the papers in order and ready to sign and was very personable. 

A great team!",5.0
13,"February 27, 2017","Chris Emory did a great job getting us into the exact vehicle we wanted.  We saw cars on the lot and in the ""system"" that were close to what we wanted, but not the perfect vehicle for us.  With Chris' help we were able to order the exact vehicle we wanted and had it built to our specifications.  Delivery time was about two months which was impressive considering the vehicle was built in Munich Germany, and shipped to Wichita Falls.  Everything was exactly as ordered.  The delivery process was smooth with a few pleasant surprises from Chris.  There was never any pressure or sales ""games"" during our purchase process.  Based on our past experiences with Patterson's, we expect the future support to be great!",5.0

15,"February 14, 2017","I had such great experience at Patterson. Cameron Moore is by far the best salesman I have ever worked with! He is trustworthy, honest, and genuinely cares about his clients. I felt no pressure at all but knew that he wanted what was best for me. It was such an easy process. We are so thankful!",5.0
16,"December 21, 2016","Recently purchased a new vehicle from Patterson Auto in Lawton, OK and had a great experience.   The staff was friendly, sincere and very helpful.  They really made the buying process simple, smooth, and enjoyable.  Chris Emery was our salesman and he was wonderful.  Never any pressure, only the desire to help.  Follow-up after the sale was superb.  Chris Lunsford handled the financing and made sure everything was prepared when we arrived.  In every aspect of the buying process they took the time to show us all of our options and to explain everything in detail.  I would definitely use them again.  Far exceeded our expectations.",5.0
17,"December 04, 2016",Cameron Moore was great to work with. He asked what I was looking for and showed me the options they had. He didn't try to push me into purchasing the car I didn't want. I would recommend visiting Patterson Auto Group to purchase your next vehicle.,5.0
18,"October 02, 2016","The working relationship I experienced with Chris Emery was enjoyable.  After the lease was consummated, the instructional time with Tyler was especially beneficial.  The only experience I had after driving the BMW that I wish I could change is the color of the instrument panel after dark.  I wish I could change the color from orange to some other color, like green or white.",4.0
19,"September 20, 2016","I knew the car I wanted and I was prepared to go to Dallas to buy it, but I didn't need to!  Patterson BMW was WONDERFUL to work with.  Chris Emery was my salesperson and he was excellent from start to finish.  Very professional and helpful.  I am so glad I was able to buy a car locally and support the local economy while getting the very best dealership experience I've had in a long time.  I feel confident I got a fair deal and I know I will buy from Patterson again.",5.0
20,"September 11, 2016","I worked with Kendrick Jones to purchase a CPO BMW they had on hand. Buying the vehicle was a very smooth and reasonable process, including some fun test drives. A professional staff gave me confidence that the dealer/brand would have my back down the road.",4.8

25,"July 10, 2016","Kendrick was so helpful with the purchase of our new BMW X5.  He was very patient and helped us to review all of our options before making a decision on which car and leasing versus buying.  I would highly recommend him and Patterson's Auto Center.

26,"June 16, 2016"," Go see Tyler C. before you do anything else. His expertise is unparalleled, I was working with another dealership and Tyler earned my business even before he quoted me a better price. No pressure sales, he won't sell you anything you don't want or need, which in turn puts you at ease to make sound decisions. He was also willing to work around my schedule, it's those little extra efforts that truly make the difference, a truly painless experience. Purchase from Tyler and BMW of Wichita Falls with confidence!!!",5.0
27,"May 30, 2016","We recently relocated to WF from Houston - we've brought and sold Mercedes , BMW and Porsches for over 30 yrs - never had any problems -Service was always  outstanding! In fact , we just purchased 2017 911  from Porsche Plano ( Collin) - every aspect of the transaction was smooth - I highly recommend- My husband went to the local dealership to trade our  2013 for 2016 - He was assisted by Chris - Chris stated the dealership would need to deduct 2000k off our trade due to the airbag recall . It was the first I ever heard of it - I contacted the service dept - who informed me that's no true - BMW was standing behind their customers - I contacted the GM (Todd) who tried to tell me Chris must be misinformed - no he was caught in a blatant lie - I can't imagine how many other innocent people he's stolen from - The GM (Todd) stated he would remedy the situation - I never heard from him - he's obviously involved in the fraud - they lost our business -Go to  Dallas  or FTW - this dealership is full of crooks - I sent a letter to BMW about the deception and lies - hopefully BMW pulls the franchise - they're ruining their image !

28,"November 05, 2015",Our salesman was very knowledgeable and easy to work with.  The entire process was easy.  Patterson's entire team was excellent.  They made sure we got what we were wanting in a new vehicle and they took a lot of time with us to make sure we understood all of the features of our new car.  We will shop there again the next time we are in the market for a new car.,5.0
29,"October 16, 2015",We have bought a couple of BMW's from Patterson's and it has always been an enjoyable experience! The sales and service staff are very friendly and make the entire experience unforgettable. I highly recommend BMW of Wichita Falls!,5.0
30,"January 28, 2014","I have taken my car twice there and both times I had to go back because the problem was not fix. My second experience was awful, the service advisor  manager told me "" ma'am you have an old car, that may cause more problems"". I felt offended and irritated, he did not only get frustrated with me, but also told me he would have to refer me to a different service location because I was yelling at him. After you basically tell me you couldn't fix my car the first time and I'm possibly coming back because my car is old, Do not expect me to be nice to you!. When I taking my car to you and paying you hundreds of dollars I expect great service and an accurate solution to my problem, not you to get frustrated with my frustration. This is not only inconvenient for me, but also money and time consuming. I am giving this review based on the fact that both times I had to come back again for them to fix what they should have fixed the first time and also based on the poor customer service provided by this individual.

31,"July 08, 2012","I BOUGHT A 2009 Certified BMW 318i Sedan with 34000 miles from these guys in April 2012. The vehicle was ""BMW Certified"" by the dealer. This car had 2 different sized front wheels on it that was not caught by the supposed 125 point dealers certification inspection. I found this from the thumping in the front end. I did not buy the tire warranty from BMW so I just bought new front tires thinking this would remedy the issue. The tire dealer said “You have 2 different sized front wheels on this car an 8 inch rim and an 8.5 inch rim. The dealer replaced it with the right sized rim. This dealer's salesman was rude to my wife and I had to call BMW USA to get the issues straightened out. Now the moon-roof is giving her (wife) trouble. This was a certified BMW inspected by the dealer. This car is under warranty. Really do I need all of this headache buying a certified near new BMW. I think not. Never again, Avoid Patterson BMW of Wichita Falls at all cost. I will trade this car at thousands lost. Avoid, Avoid, Avoid this dealer. 

(A)Customer Service---2= I have been back to this dealer for rework 3 times
(B)Quality of Work---1= Deadline safety issue with vehicle not caught on the inspection (wheels 2 different sizes)
(C)Friendliness---2= The salesman was rude to his customer (My wife) when she was trying to get her BMW corrected. 
(D)Overall Experience---2= They are great when you have the checkbook out but terrible afterwards.
(E) Price= Price was decent.",2.0
