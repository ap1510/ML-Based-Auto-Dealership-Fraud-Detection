0,"June 21, 2020",Ryan was very professional and quick. We started the process online and then spent little time at the dealership. Very pleased with the experience. Also the finance guy was good too just not sure what his name was. Best car buying experience we have ever had. ,5.0
1,"June 04, 2020","This is the worst place Ever From Top to bottom.. My Car Wouldn't one night while leaving work so i had my car towed here... My car was sitting for 1 week before even being diagnosed.. I was confused to why it wouldnt start because  there was no check engine lights on and I had just got and oil change and was told my car was immalculant and well kept.. So afyer getting frustrated with the kack of communication i exploded not knowing it would cost me my car.. Even though i was warn not to xxxx the mechanics off because things like this happens well I guess my mouth has cost me this time ..so after along 2 1/2 weeks finally i go to pick my truck up  Buick classic had installed and engine.. I was so excited to have my truck back the Day before my Bday.. Oh Snap well that ended fast after to hours of picking it up and 10 to 15 minutes of driving it here cones trouble.. Car stops dead and will not move... 1st i checked engine oil.. Nope there was none.. I recorded it i have proof so instead of celebrating my bday im back at gm classic buick.. Im Mad, Frustrated and digusted at this point.. So after being promise a loaner car and didnt get it.. And allnof the confusion around the situation I shows Justin my video of No oil which is whatbi told steve the day before so now saturday there is oil ...and to make these thieves even more digusting before they admit that they messed up and fix the problem they take the coward way out to protect their job.. And Now the new oroblen is the tranfer box.. So how you missed the transfer box when you did diagnosis or what made you go straight for a new/Used engine instead well let me tell you why its either i didn't need the engine or that I  cuss y'all out so bad you got revenge on my truck so please don't trust this place and if im too late Bring your car somewhere to be check..They Value Money Not Life My Grandbabies was in that truck... Shaun, Steve and Justin are Pathetic... ",1.0
2,"September 05, 2019","My new sales representative Andrea made the entire experience very easy and non-stressful right from the very beginning.  She was upfront and honest about everything and I did not feel like I was being cheated out of anything.  She was very pleasant, professional, and knowledgeable on the vehicle I was looking for and available to answer all of the many questions.  I had a new vehicle I'd recently purchased two months prior that I was unhappy with and wanted to trade it in for something different...the dealership where I purchased the the vehicle from was just too far away from where I lived so I choose dealerships that were closer.  Andrea was punctual and dialed in to what I wanted to see while at the dealership and even went the extra step with me to show me vehicles that were just recently brought to the dealership so I could be 100% sure of my choice and I’m really glad she did that because I changed my mind once I saw the truck in the other lot.  I’m a very straightforward person and walked away from a different dealership earlier that week because they were trying to pull a fast one over my head and I didn’t like it...drove 20 miles the other direction to meet with Andrea at Classic Buick GMC and got the deal I was looking for without the hassle and swindling.  I was in-and-out within a little over an hour.  Andrea has surely made my wife and I lifetime customers and I tell everyone about her and about the dealership whenever I get a chance.  Thank you Andrea for outstanding service! You’ve just made a lifetime customer!",5.0
3,"March 18, 2017",Bought a car off Autotrader. Paid cash by wire transfer and a cc deposit. Flew my mechanic to inspect. Dealer was very accommodating as they spent several hours allowing my guy to check out. Even lifted it on a rack and had one on their mechanics available for questions. Salesman told me he would send my guy back with title. He didn't. Two weeks later I have no title. Where I live I have 7 days to register or there is penalty. Total frustration with this dealer! Life doesn't have to be so difficult. ,2.2

5,"August 15, 2016","I took my Yukon in on a Saturday to have my brakes serviced. I noticed a $99.95 price per axle for brake service and agreed with that price. I also wanted to have my 'Check Engine' light diagnosed. I interacted with Dale and Justin in service whom then introduced me to Edward Cabral. I have no complaints with the three gentlemen I spoke with. Edward treated me very well and professionally and provided me with a loaner vehicle while my Yukon was kept in-house for the work to be performed. 

The problem resides in how I was advised by Carolyn Coker that my routine brake service would turn out to be $700+, just shy of $800. This would include turning the rotors, replacing the brake pads, and flushing the brake system. Is this not part of the $99.95 per axle cost for brake service? I was advised by Carolyn that the advertised price is for ACDelco pads and that my vehicle requires OEM pads. OEM for any GM vehicle is ACDelco, as ACDelco is owned by GM. She begged to differ with me claiming that OEM pads for my vehicle are not ACDelco, therefore have a higher cost. She also informed me my vehicle is an exception to the brake service. At this point I just checked out mentally and frustration forced me to tell her to leave my vehicle as-is so as not to incur any unwanted or agreed-upon charges. How dissatisfying.",2.5
6,"August 05, 2016","I had to stop in to have a key FOB re-programmed.  Mr. Edward Cabral was more than professional, but, equally as engaging and kind.  Service Manager's of this caliber makes the wait, if there is one, so much easier on the customers.

Kudos to Classic for employing him
