If additional service is needed in the future, I will certainly contact your dealership.

Best regards,

1,"June 17, 2020","I first visited this dealership back in the winter and I was impressed with their knowledge of the product
and they was no pressure for me to buy.  After that they kept in touch with me and answered questions that I had.  When I went back in May we both knew pretty much what I wanted and what we needed to complete the deal so we didn't waste a lot of time.   They are very nice and friendly and I think you will be happy if you go there.",5.0

3,"April 06, 2020","I can go to my local oil change place and get an oil change for $42, the only 2 times I have been to this dealership it has been over $200 and $300 respectively.... my local oil change place was closed due to Covid 19 or I would not have came to Mathews!! But unfortunately it was and instead of using Toyota like I have done in the past I used your Honda dealership and of course the filters was dirty but instead of blowing them out, you guys suggested replacement for the 2nd time in 40,000 miles and that my transmission fluid needed to be changed at you guessed it 40,000 miles!! People are really friendly and nice there but I sure do since some price guaging at this location... I will take my Honda to Toyota or drive back to MCKINNEY if I need to just to get service ",1.0

7,"July 03, 2012","Presentation and customer service by Jason was excellent! While waiting for the first offer, family behind me was offered $500 a month payment by Will, which was ridiculous to even consider. Family started to walk out. Will came back with a $350 a month payment, which was closer to a fair offer. Hearing the $500 a month payment offer should have been my first clue. First offer for me was $350 a month. I already knew that was $50 a month higher than what should have been offered. Worked the price down to $315 a month. Then was told the $399 charge for window etching, which had not been done yet, was not an option. Was told an extra $2,000 charge would be added so they could make money. Wait! What? Was told the etching and extra charge were non-negotiable. That is just wrong. I recommend looking elsewhere unless you have money to give away.",1.6
