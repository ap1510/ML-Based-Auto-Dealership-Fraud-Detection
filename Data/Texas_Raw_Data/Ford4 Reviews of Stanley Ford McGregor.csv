0,"August 24, 2018","Our sales rep Jose Manzano was excellent. he was not high pressure and he did a great job showing us different vehicles. 
Stanley Ford was excellent as a dealership to do business with, the whole process was fast and easy and again our sales person Joe Manzano was terrific.
I recommend this dealership and ask for Joe to help you with your next vehicle",5.0

2,"November 20, 2016","I have been to Stanley multiple times to buy vehicles, and every time they have been nothing but amazing. I have worked with Brad Young every time and have always had a great buying experience and have been able to call on him to take care of any issue I was having even after the purchasing part was over. The sales manager Leo is always available to talk to customers and makes you feel like you are the most important customer they have when he sees you.   Working with their finance guy is a breeze too.  Ernesto is not pushy at all on the warranties and works to make sure that you get the absolute best interest rate they can find. I could not recommend this place more, and send everyone that I know who is looking for a car or truck out there. Like my family has learned, it might be little further out than some of the dealerships in Waco proper, but the customer service makes it worth the drive. We will definitely continue to buy all of our vehicles at Stanley. ",5.0
3,"November 20, 2016","I had a very good experience with all those involved in buying my new Super Duty. Very straight forward and we did really communicate. Sometimes salesmen become so involved with the sale that they communicate to you through the ""closing technique"" instead of talking to you. Everyone that I dealt with was genuine. A rarity now days. And a very good price to boot. ",5.0
