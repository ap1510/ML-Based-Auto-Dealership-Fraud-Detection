1,"November 16, 2017","I called 5 ford dealers and went to 2 dealerships trying to buy a F 150 for an advertised price.   Team Ford did not advertise anything different than the Ford.com site, they gave me the truck I wanted with a price and experience I was looking for ... 5 years later I chose to buy from Team Ford again. The owners do a great job keeping a great staff. Thank you Tim Wood for taking care of us.",5.0
