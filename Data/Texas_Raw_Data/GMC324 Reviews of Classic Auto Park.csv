49,"November 07, 2018","Washes are awesome we have 4 vehichles in thia household.  Oil change center is horrible.  I checked my daghter truck out and thats why i took it for a super clean the 35 dollar one and get oil changed.  Fluids were not tipped off filled or checked.  Just oil got changed.  I had to just get bake fluid myself and fill it so light go off.  I even took it to mechanic shop to be checked out and its all fine was just low fluid. Also they claimed it needed fuel service.  Blue Gorilla also cleared that statement too.  Again stick to the wasges and stay away from oil change center part. They wanted to do 400 dollars of stuff and blue gorilla put the truck in the clear.  I almost got conned but luckly i declined knowing blue gorilla is a legit mechanic place that wont rip you off. The manager that was filling in for the other regular manager was a conartist.  I wished i would have waited for the regular manager ti get back from vacation,  cause that woyld have never happened.  And my daughter truck still never got wasged and i spent almost 200 dollars that day.  Very dissapointed ",1.8

75,"October 24, 2018","I took my 2018 Cadillac in for the oil change and tire rotation.  The service on that was good but the free car wash that comes with each trip to the service center was piss poor.  My car was washed out back of the service center and it was extremely poor.  There was bird waste on the back of my car before being serviced and my car certainly needed to be washed.  The car was returned with water dripping and running down the doors and the drivers window was rolled down  As soon as I rolled the window up I had water spots on it.. I brought the car home and got a rag to clean the window, get the dried water runs off and then I spotted the bird waste still on my car.  I then took the car to Classic Car Wash and paid $25 to clean my car.  This never happened with my 2017 Cadillac because it was always washed at the Classic Car Wash and not outside the service center.  Very Poor Service and this also happened on my friends 2018 Cadillac.  You need to start using Classic Car Wash again and not out back of the service center.  Due to the lousy car wash I had to spend $25 to get my car clean..  That is piss poor service and I am certainly not satisfied.",2.4

85,"October 16, 2018","Ken was as helpful as he could be but I cannot say the same for Mazda.  I purchased my first Mazda 3 weeks ago and was very happy with my purchase.  It being a replacement for a much older car it had all the bells and whistles my wife so badly wanted.  Unfortunately we did not understand which items had to be turned off at night and the battery drained.  I thought no big deal and called my brother in law to come give my a jump which he did.  Problem is the navigation/back up camera screen now displays the message “unable to read a program, refer to dealer”,  The reason for my visit!  $152 later Ken tells me I need a new radio head.  Bad news is the Mazda replacement part cost $4,500 not counting installation.  I declined!!!  I looked up aftermarket replacement online and I can purchase from numerous suppliers for $399.  Totally insane!!!  I have owned Chevrolet. Dodge, Toyota, Nissan, Chrysler, Honda, Cadillac, Oldsmobile (I am 70 and nave children) all of which I was pleased with.

I told them I would go get lunch and come back. When I got back they had not even started on it because the young man was looking for me even though two people knew what needed to be done.

He was actually a pleasure to deal with even though things were not going well for awhile. I believe that the car is finally fixed, at least I hope it is, and Chuck even had my car detailed to say thank you for being so patient. Thank you Chuck.

Usually receive better service than this.

323,"April 14, 2015","Not only did I buy they car I was trading in from this same dealership brand new. I had someone willing to do the financing if the numbers were right. They didn't want to give my ""anything"" for my car which had less than 20k miles, they wouldn't even give us a call back to let us know what was going on, if we wanted to know anything we had to keep calling and bugging them. Then we were told that they could get the payments we wanted with a down pymt., so I get the money for the down pymt and then for some reason (the same day) the payments had jumped up $130. (come to find out later) they bank they claimed would do it, sent us a letter saying they denied it all together, this was even after we told them not to send it there, because we knew they wouldn't do it. and lets not forget to mention that when I asked my salesperson his last name, he wouldn't tell me. I would NEVER recommend this dealership to anyone. Not the only bad experience we have had there either. ",1.0
