1,"June 23, 2020","We looked on the internet found what car we wanted, spoke with Kenzie
drove from Ardmore OK, bought my car.  
We couldn't have asked for anything better or easier.
Family atmosphere, but safe for social distancing
Kenzie is a special person, 
We love the Lincoln Nautilus, still trying to figure all the bells and whistles out, 
thank you ",5.0
2,"June 20, 2020","I have not bought a new car in 20 years but had the most amazing experience at Bob Utter Ford. Terry Thomas in sales and Dustin McCormack in finance made this an enjoyable experience. Both were very personable, professional and knowledgeable and made everything easy and all was done in a timely manner. I give them an A+ rating. I will definitely be a repeat customer. Thank you! Sheila Roberts",5.0
3,"June 19, 2020","Staff and service was wonderful at Bob Utter Ford. Eric Wicklund was fantastic and stayed late on the day we came in to purchase vehicle after toward the end of the day, he stayed until after the paperwork for financing was completed. Both the sales member and finance representative were incredibly friendly and made the process not only smooth but quick we were in and out of the dealership in less than an hour and half. We will definitely be back in the future and would recommend to anyone looking for a new or used vehicle.",5.0
4,"June 13, 2020","I purchased a 2019 ""new"" Ford Ranger from Tommy Ellis. I say ""new"" because it was previously used as a loaner vehicle for the dealership so it had about 2,400 miles on it.

You'll find that the dealership is split from Sherman and Denison and if you show up to the wrong location, you get to drive back and forth (roughly a 15 minute drive one way). Not a huge deal, just inefficient and a waste of time.

They gave a lowball offer for my trade-in (significantly lower than the KBB instant cash value price), but I accepted it. They listed the vehicle on their website for just under three times more than what they offered within a couple days.

I didn't much care for negotiating with the sales manager who proceeded to just walk away while talking. It may be a negotiating tactic, albeit a rude one.

The finance manager, Chris McClour, was probably the best finance person I'd ever worked with. He offered the standard extended warranties and gap insurance pitch, but in no way did he push it further when you said no. He was the best interaction I had during the entire process.

Speaking of finance, I opted to use the Ford financing since you get an additional $750 rebate for doing so. My credit score was 815. The rate they gave me was 7.4%. Read that again. Credit score of 815 gets an APR of 7.4%. xxx kind of rate do you get if your credit score was in the 600s? 20%??? Are they using a loan shark?

Whoever did the tint job on the driver side window applied the tint on top of some writing on the window. They had to remove it and reapply the tint. How that happened to begin with was a solid ""not my job"". When asked how long that would take, I was told 20 minutes. In reality, it took 40 minutes. I had been there four hours by this point. The tint they redid has a bunch of bubbles at the top. They tacked on $299 onto the cost of the truck for tint. For $299, I would expect a better job. The rear windows and back windows came standard with privacy glass and no tint was applied to those windows. It was $299 for TWO windows, the driver and passenger. I've had an entire SUV tinted (all 4 windows + massive sunroof + rear) tinted for $300 with a lifetime warranty included. Complete ripoff that comes with poor workmanship. There's also no way to remove this charge since they just go ahead and do it to their vehicles. The charge isn't listed online, but when you show up, your financial sheet will have an additional $299 on it for tint. Go ahead and add that amount to whatever price you see online.

The vehicle itself was not detailed or cleaned prior to being available for purchase. There were still loaner contracts in the glovebox and dirt / scratches / scuffs inside.

My biggest gripe is I have been trying to reach Tommy to address a few minor issues I found with the truck. I have left him a voicemail on his cell AND on his office phone, two different days. Four days later, still no callback. They take your money and then disappear off the face of the earth. I'll update this review if they ever actually call back, which I highly doubt.",2.2

33,"February 25, 2020","Purchased a new Kia here (this survey only allows the option to select a Ford, Lincoln, or Mercury make - why a “new” Mercury is an option makes no sense).  No pressure no haggle experience was a plus. Salesman Eric is easy to work with and kept his word on any commitments made.

37,"February 14, 2020",The service offered was very good. The failure rate on the ‘radio touch screen’ and AGM BATTERY was depressing and offered cause to re evaluate my commitment to Ford products (the F 150 XLT is only 1 yr old). $1000 in replacement parts is not acceptable ,4.0

73,"September 20, 2019","I have given a four star rating because my wife and I sat in the waiting area approximately an hour and a half while this repair was made.  There were two other items I had listed that were not corrected to my satisfaction.  One was the fact that I am having irritating fumes inside the vehicle and two, instead of having a decent sounding horn, the horn is not up to Ford standards.  When I researched the problem, Ford Motor Company, as a ""cost savings"", has chosen to provide one horn instead of the customary twin horns.  The tone is an embarrassment for a car with the MSRP listing of fifty thousand dollars.  
And I should mention, the personnel were very outgoing and accommodating on the phone and in person.  I realize some jobs take longer than others to repair and the actual time is sometimes longer than the allotted time.  I was just disappointed that the two items were not fixed to my satisfaction.  I am still experiencing fumes inside my vehicle.  And, my horn still sounds ""wimpy"".",4.8

The car was as advertised and the transaction was seem less and perfect; easy, breezy. 

The salesman, Terry Thomas, was outstanding, as was the dealer tech man.  We were given a complete 30-40 minute rundown on all the vehicle features including hands on demonstrations of each feature. 

They took the time to make certain that we were comfortable and satisfied with our selection.

106,"April 23, 2019","Horrible service department with an entitled nepotistic attitude. There may be some decent sales people there but the underwhelming stink of mediocrity and entitlement from the service department ruins any chance of me ever coming back to do business with them again. I am on my second truck in two years with a failed ""SYNC"" module and when I spoke with the service writer he had nothing but sarcastic euphemisms like ""well I didn't build the truck, I just work here"", and when I pushed back it culminated with him crying like a child and refusing me service because that is what happens when you have failed leadership in a parts department, you get self important children who run to daddy when they are called out for running their mouth, with daddy being the very manager who instigates this corporate culture. I went immediately to the dealership in whitesboro and traded in the truck they refused to repair even though it was from the Utter lot and under warranty, and traded it in for a 70K truck. I'll never go back.",1.0

108,"April 20, 2019","I wish I would of known what to do about this ? I had a 2007 Ford Fusion , the day my troubles started we had stop to fill the car up with gas  . Then we proceeded to the house , after a while we were to go somewhere ! The car wouldn’t start  , now the motor would turn over  ! I have worked on older cars and trucks ! But being a newer car I had no idea ! We called Bob Utter Ford , they sent out a wrecker to take it to Bob Utter service department to see what wrong . It cost 75 dollars to take it in ! The next day they called and said the motor was bad  and give me a price to replace the motor . Now I told them what happens and I don’t believe it the motor . They guarantee it the motor , it won’t turn over ! They tried ! So I told them to bring it back and I would pay the wrecker again ! ( 75 dollars again )This is where we are at now ! Then next day I went out to look at the car , thinking what to do  ! I tried to turn the car over , because I still didn’t believe it and it turn over , but still wouldn’t start , so I called Bob Utters again and told them the car was turning over , they said they would come and get it again , they did ! Later that day they called the motor would turn over but it had low compression on two cylinders . A price and did I want to fix it , I still didn’t believe them because of the way everything has happen ! So bring it back I guess , ( another 75 dollars ) !! Now I paid 75 dollars 3 times with 2 different diagnoses  ! Now we allow me to explain this , I sent the car to yet another mechanic, the next day he called me and wanted to know if I had just filled the car with gas , the gas tank and the motor cylinders was full of water , he give me a price to fix it and I let him , over 1000 dollars, but the next day I pick it up and it run perfect ! So I think Bob Utter didn’t check it , just to sell a motor  , I don’t know that for sure just seems like that !! So I think I was wronged !!!",1.4

I was tired of the mystery numbers being thrown at me elsewhere and it’s not rocket science to figure out I was not getting a very good deal at another dealer.  Packed up my stuff and headed up to your dealership and was greeted by Chris Mitchell.  Chris was honest and to the point and let me look around and helped guide me to more what I was looking for and shot straight on the price.   I enjoyed talking with him and he definitely made me feel welcome and comfortable.  He actually got me in a truck above the price range I thought I could afford and made me a fair deal without having to ask 16 managers to work out pricing with me.  Couldn’t be happier with the truck, and in just two visits with Chris, feel like I picked up a friend in the process.  Chris did an excellent job in letting me look at all the options and then telling me what was in my price range, or what we needed to stretch to get me in to.  It wasn’t until after we signed a deal that I learned about the whole CM Experience!!!   As I’m sitting in my truck right now doing this survey, there is not one thing I am not happy with.   Chris was responsive and communicated with me on everything and we had quite a few laughs along the way.  Simple, painless and actually fun.  Everyone was great.  Financing was easy and didn’t take long either.  All in all had a great experience and Chris was key to all of that!  ",5.0

So I have a pretty good feel about salesmen. Even thou we never met in person & only talked on the phone I got a good feeling I was dealing with a honest person. From time to time in life, you run across someone that is a pleasure to deal with. Brian was one of those. Utter Ford should be proud they have a salesperson like him.

252,"January 11, 2016","With my '07 Ford Escape getting up there in mileage, it was time for us to buy another truck. After doing hours and hours of research on-line I had narrowed down the trucks / cars I wanted to look at. There were several trucks and a couple of cars spread out among  four dealerships. Taking into account my past experiences with the Bob Utter Ford \ Lincoln \ Kia dealership (all extremely positive) I decided to start with them. The day was overcast, cold, windy and wet;  not the best day to go shopping for a new truck. Arriving at the Pre-owned Supercenter of Bob Utter Ford we were met in the lot by Brad Kerrigan. The weather seemed to have no effect on him, he was energetic, friendly and likeable. As it turned out he is also extremely knowledgeable about all aspects of purchasing a quality pre-owned vehicle. With just a few questions he knew what type, make, model and price range of truck we were looking for. Within minutes he was showing us the prefect truck. My first thoughts on seeing the truck he showed us was ""no way this is in my price range, this is way more truck than I can afford"". I had spent the previous week researching new and used vehicles and had a good idea what I could afford.  Brad told me that ""This is the truck for you"". A short test drive later I was sold on trying to get this truck. We went inside and began the paperwork. In a very short while (compared to any other vehicle shopping experience I have had) he had the paper work prepared, financing confirmed and us headed over to the finance office. From the time I entered the lot until I was driving off with my new Pre-owned truck was less than the time it took to drive to the dealership. Brad Kerrigan has a degree of professionalism, honesty and integrity that is difficult to match anywhere. If you are in the market for a quality pre-owned vehicle, make the trip to Bob Utter Ford \ Lincoln \ Kia to the Pre-Owned Supercenter and talk to Brad - you will not find a better person to purchase from.      ",5.0
253,"November 18, 2015","So I called up there and wanted to drive the ML63 they had spoke to Malcolm Ross, made the appointment and went up to Sherman to test drive the car. When, I got there he had no clue about the Car at all basically I had to tell him everything. We test drove the car on Hwy 82 and car was pulling to the right like crazy even Malcolm stated that he doesn't know why the car was pulling. When I came back to the dealership I spoke to the Used car sales Manager Tommy (was not a very professional person) He was more focused on his Facebook messages then speaking to me anyways asked him what is the best he can do on the car and he stated it was $29971.00 and they will only be making $250.00 dollars at that cost. Told him something is definitely wrong with the car as it is pulling to the right. Malcolm was standing there and they both said it was OK for me to take to Mercedes Benz and if they find something major the dealership (bob utter will take care of it) But they were not willing to work on the price so I left. 

2 days later Chris Chathcock called from the dealership and asked me if have purchased another Vehicle yer and i have told him I was going to test drive one that day. And he then stated they have dropped the price to $27000 and invited me back to the dealership it was Saturday and I was at autos of Dallas and test driving the other ML63. I have decided to get that car but when they asked me for my driver license I didn't realize that I had left it at Bob utter ford Malcolm never returned it back to me. So I called Chris back and told him I was getting the ML63 for $27000 and he said he can give me his for $26750.00. I told him that was acceptable if they allow me to take the car to the benz and get it checked out the then stated he will speak to his manager Austin and call me back. He called me back about 10 minutes later and stated that was fine and I can take it there on Monday or I can come buy the car today and when I take it if they find something major Bob utter will take care of it as they stand by every car they sell. I once again told him that car was pulling to the right and he stated to give me peace of mind he had his master mechanic looked at the car and everything had checked out and it was just low on Air. And again stated when I take the car to the Mercedes Benz if they find something that is major they will take care of it as they stand by every car they sell.

So I decided to take there word as we have previously done business with this dealership a while back and they treated us really good. We drove to Sherman and did all the paperwork on the car and most if the information have given him on the phone so when we got there it was very fast process as they closed at 5. I did not drive the car home my wife did but the next day when I was about to take the car out to get it washed I realize that the Steering wheel was not going up and down and was making rather loud noise. I texted Chris and told him that there was a problem with the steering wheel and he never replied. So I called Austin the next day and also sent the Email to the GM (which by the way i never got a respond from) . I took the car to Mercedes Benz and they have told me I need a new Steering wheel Column, New brakes and rotors, New spark Plugs. Right had lower arm front control arm was also damaged all set and done they repair were going to cost me over $6500.00. I Called Austin and told him about the steering wheel and also the control arm. He told me to go ahead and bring the car in and they will check it out and he will see what the owner BOB UTTER wants to do. So I took the car in and was told i have purchased the car AS IS and there is nothing they can do and they didn't know about these issues at the time of the inspection. So if anyone has driven this car and know about these issues please call me I am planning on getting an Attorney i already have one witness who said the dealership knew about the steering wheel.

The reviews I had read were ABSOLUTELY correct!  I felt like he put my best interest FIRST rather than seeing how little he could give and still get the sale.   I was coming from Louisiana to purchase the car.  Brad worked with me throughout the day to answer any questions I had, sent pictures, etc via phone and text.  Sent me the financial paperwork and took it over to the finance guy, then sent me back what my payments would be.  He even discounted the car further to compensate me for the trip to come purchase the car!!!  When we arrived we were greeted at the door by name.  The paperwork was waiting for us to sign.  No waiting around there, and no major trying to pursuade us to add on more stuff to the deal.  Chris simply told us what was available, and let us decide - NO pushy high pressure sales pitch!  Quick and efficient. After the purchase of the car, their ""tech guy,"" Danny, sat in the car with us and made sure we were comfortable with all the features and how to use them.  From arrival at the front door to pulling out of the parking lot with a full tank of gas took only two hours!  Everyone we dealt with was simply AWESOME!!!  No haggling over price - can't imagine getting a better deal than they offered me!!!  Now I'm glad it took a month to find the car I wanted, and the wait was well worth it!!!!!!!",5.0
260,"January 07, 2015",This was my 3rd purchase from Bob Utter Ford. I've always had a great experience from both the sales and service department. There's certainly a reason why I continue to buy my cars here. I would recommend the dealership hands down. Our salesman Tommy Altland has delivered everytime on price and customer service. Thanks again Bob Utter Ford!!!!!!!!,5.0
261,"May 28, 2013",The worst buying experience in my 70+ years.  Used cars I attempted to purchase priced TWICE book value - rude and arbitrary sales manager; would not consider nor discuss reasonable offers.,1.3
