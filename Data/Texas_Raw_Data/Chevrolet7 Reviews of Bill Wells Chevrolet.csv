0,"January 22, 2019","Wanted to shop close to home but felt like they really did not want to deal. Finally received a lower offer to ""seal the deal"" when in actuality GM added another rebate. Price match? they were still approx. $3,000.00 too high. Recommend you do your homework and your math before you buy.",2.4

2,"March 21, 2016","We had some serious issues with this dealership initially, but after a few weeks they decided to honor their original contract offer. Reviews on websites like this one really can make a difference & serve as a way for consumers to have their voices heard when they experience an injustice. ",3.0
3,"July 10, 2015","Called and spoke with Alan Collum about a Silverado he had on the lot. Within 20 minutes, he not only met the sale price that Gene Messer Chevrolet offered me, he beat it in a more expensive, better equipped truck.  I will definitely return!",5.0

6,"May 04, 2013","SCAM ARTIST!!! He personally tried to sell a fatally frame damaged and shade tree repaired vehicle to my 70 year old mother.  His dealership owned the vehicle for over 6+ months and put 500+ miles on it. He claimed that it had do damage but it had a bolt broke off in a brake caliper, the drive shaft was bents and dented, the carrier bearing was broken, the CV joints were throwing grease all over, the rear brakes were gone and the battery blew up in the accident that was not show up on Carfax.  A collision repair shop and an Official Texas Inspection Center in Plainview, TX found the above stated damages.
He is not concerned with your safety and will scam and lie in order to get you to buy from him.",1.8
