1,"March 17, 2019","Got a quote on a 2019 Equinox 1LT with confidence and convenience package for $28,600 out-the-door. When I got there, they tried to raise the price to $29,200 saying that I didn't qualify for a $600 rebate KNOWING that had already been discussed in a text message with the salesman. I walked out and went to Peter's Chevrolet in Longview and bought the SAME Equinox for $25,200. That's $4,000 less for the SAME vehicle.",1.5
2,"February 21, 2012","Robert was friendly and personable.  However we were shopping for a new 2012 Chevy Traverse and he or no one at the dealership that Saturday could show us how to work the second row seating on the new Traverse.  We wanted a spare tire and they told us that it was not offered on many Traverses.  We went to (2) other dealerships and every single one had the spare tire.  We also wanted 20"" wheels and they were adament that you would have to upgrade to the LTZ package.  We have found that was not correct at all.  We found an upgrade to the ""all star edition"" gives you wheels and many other features.  We feel these folks are sadly under qualified to sell the Traverse or else they just want to sell units in any manner possible.  We plan on driving our 2012 Traverse to the dealership to show Robert and the general manager the sale they missed out on due to uninformed personnel and poor sales tactics.",2.8
