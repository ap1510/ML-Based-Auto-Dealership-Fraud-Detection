They got me in and out and I would like to say thank you to each of them. They work like a team needs to. Great job everyone. And a big thank you to Leslie Todd my service Advisor that has been there for me from day one. Thank you so much.,5.0
1,"February 16, 2020","I received a mailer from All American Chevrolet on Friday night. Usually I toss these in the trash, but took a minute, out of sheer curiosity, and texted the link to see what my car might be worth. I got a quick response from Leticia Henson and was set up for an appointment on Saturday afternoon with Calvin Hooper II (the Chevy King). I went only because I wanted the promised $20 gift card for having my car appraised. I was NOT planning on trading in my 2017 Trax. Calvin was very friendly yet professional and listened closely to my story. He wasn’t pushy; he was very busy but didn’t rush me in any way. I ended up buying a new 2020 Trax sight unseen, I also worked with Tony Banta who was also very friendly and professional and he explained all the paperwork clearly and concisely while answering the few questions I had. I am looking forward to picking up my new car tomorrow!! ",5.0

6,"December 11, 2019","Michael Long was great, courteous knowledgeable, the finance manager Anthony soured the deal with rude treatment during final signing of paperwork because I asked questions and decided not to purchase an extended warranty. So much so that I stopped the entire process, took my car keys and title back and headed home. Did not end up purchasing the car because I could not give my business to disrespectful people.",1.0

9,"October 23, 2018"," In the process of looking for a new vehicle  I had stopped at many dealerships between Austin Waco and Killeen.   Once I knew my budget, what vehicle I wanted and was ready to buy they pulled out all the stops  and were able to give me  features I thought were outside of my budget.  Additionally  they gave me more for my trade-in then any other dealership.  

 I had the opportunity to speak with the general manager “Mike” about what  I wanted and needed.  

Overall for the first time in my car buying experiences I felt like I was not being taken advantage of.   Don’t waste your time and other dealerships.

Big thanks to Monica and Mike for helping me get an amazing truck for an amazing price. ",5.0

11,"July 20, 2018","I just bought my second vehicle from Tyrone. 
He seen me  in the service department when I was getting my oil changed a few months ago and asked me how I liked my car. I was thinking of trading it in for a truck so we talked and told me to let him know when I was ready. That was 4 months ago. He isn't a high pressure salesman and moved at my pace.  

Damon explained the cost of computer/technology repairs from his personal experience and relationship with the service department. I can transfer the coverage to another vehicle or get refunded the difference if I trade this one in later.  

I really appreciate their professionalism and laid back approach.",5.0

16,"May 25, 2018",We had no Intention of purchasing a truck. Tyrone showed us we could afford it without breaking g our budget. I will buy from Tyrone again in the future and will recommend him to friends and family,5.0
17,"May 21, 2018","Tyrone helped easy the purchase of buying our dream car. His expert opinion of the corvette combined with his thirteen years in car sales made the purchase that much easier. Having had some fun with Tyron during the whole car buying experience we found out that he has had extensive training on the corvette which is why he could answered all our questions directly and to the point. I must say, if you the reader is thinking to oneself, “sure that Guy can afford a vette”,  I would not stop you in thinking that way, but what I would say is if you are in the market for that car of your dreams or one of purpose here is where you should lie your hopes. There’s smiles down there at All American Chevrolet of Killeen just remember to ask for Tyrone Jackson you wont be disappointed

19,"May 14, 2018",After online car shopping I visited five different dealers of course looking for the best deal. The service I received at American Chevrolet of Killeen was by far the best car buying experience I've had in over 35 years! Tyrone Jackson was my sales person and his customer service skills are impeccable; I even received text messages to make me aware of new arrivals fitting the price range and type of car I wanted. He was very professionalism and yet made my experience personable. The great experience continued as the financial process was handled by Anthony Gibson. Very informative and detailed in explaining warranties/ documents throughout the finance process. Another professional with a great personality that made my car buying experience the best I've had in 35 years! A+ American Chevrolet!  ,5.0

27,"March 07, 2018","2 vehicles bought in 3 years with these guys, huge discounts and even additional money taken off when I came in to finalize each time. Mr Jackson was the real deal and 100% transparent, he is obviously there to make money but he didn't make it about that, he made it more about getting us into another vehicle, great man. Mr Perez takes a little while to be get prepared but he to has closed both vehicles with ease and made it simple, and once at his desk everything was explained clearly and he made sure you understood. I know people say you can't get a good deal in Killeen but I now have had 2 in 3 years!!!",5.0
28,"February 28, 2018",We are from Alabama and traveled 12 hours one way to All American Chevrolet of Killeen. I had spoken with Tyrone Jackson over the phone and he was great! He got us to the price we needed to be on my 4runner! He was very welcoming and a all around good guy. Not once did we feel out of place he made us feel right at home and had us laughing! He even took the time out of his day to make sure we made it home okay! Not many people will do that these days! So happy with our purchase from them! And happy to have met Mr. Jackson. Thank y’all so much for everything! ,5.0
29,"February 08, 2018","Tyrone Jackson was very professional, we went to All American Dealership to look for a truck, Tyrone met us with a warm greeting and we felt that he had known us for a long time. We got there at 4:30 pm and by 6:45 PM we were driving out of the dealership with the truck that we had been looking for. That was the quickest in and out of ANY Dealership that we have ever been in. Without Tyrone Jackson Dedication and Professionalism, we would of been there longer and would’ve had to come back the next day!!! We believe that this should be the standard way to get the job done.
We want to thank the entire All American Dealership for a great experience and we will be telling everyone we know about our experience at All American Chevrolet

31,"January 05, 2018",My sales representative was Brandon Barker and he was phenomenal. Brandon warmly welcomed me in and quickly established that he was there to assist me in my future vehicle. He was very knowledgeable on the features of the vehicle I was inquiring about. As you at times being at a dealership could be a draining process and it wasn't I was in and out but during my time there I had a blast with him and the amazing team there. Their team cohesion is amazing. I took a stack of his cards to give out. Thanks Brandon for the great experience!!!,5.0
32,"December 27, 2017",We went into this dealership to get an oil change.  Upon arriving we stood in front of the customer service desk for almost 5 minutes not being acknowledged by the 2 gentlemen.  Finally a lady approached and sat in her chair.  My husband initiated the conversation and said can you help me  she did reply yes.  As my husband looked over the older gentleman in this department glared at him.  So not a great first impression.  Once our car was done she grabbed the paperwork from the mechanic.   She then sat down and started texting before finishing our paperwork.    Once she decided to do our paperwork we were sent over to the cashier.  When we tried to pay we couldn't pay with cash unless we had the exact amount because the cash was in the bosses office locked up.  She then was telling us how he had just had a new baby; and that is great however this isn't nothing more than an excuse after already having bad customer service. Im sure someone coyld have called him since most people have a cell phone to make this happen.  It wasn't really early that we were there either.  They open at 7 and we were trying to pay at 11am.  Will not return to this location ever. Would drive an hour further for better customer service. ,1.8

44,"October 27, 2017","So we walked in to get a closer look. Marcus Washington wasn't hard on us, personality was great and the whole buying process from A to Z went super easy. My husband and myself almost thought something horrible would stop the smooth ride... that's how smooth it was. Super helpful and detailed. Knew his stuff, great multitasker. Understands that time IS a valuable thing. Hiccups along the way were handled and or helped with. You can definitely breath some fresh air with Mr. Marcus. 
Joe was also a kind, great, calm guy, left with a shiny new family car. 👍🏼",5.0

48,"September 21, 2017","Walked in looking for something affordable. I had a total of 4 car dealership to go to. First stop was Chevrolet. Was instantly greeted didn't even have to walk inside. Had my G'parents with me. Megan was super kind cool and generous also very talkative but that was a good thing told great stories and experiences was like talking to a sister. I narrowed down what car I wanted you based on price 22,000 with payments no more than 300. Test drove a couple cars I took a liking to the chevy cruze LT. Unfortunately car was a bit too much above my price range so after all the extra details and putting in all that information before you even get to sign the paper work. I told them I had other places to stop by and see about there cars. Right before I started to get up out of my seat megan boss swoops in and tells me I can get you an offer @ your price range just give me a second let me talk to finances. In about 20 mins I was sold and headed in to to finalize the deal. I highly recommend Chevrolet in E central  killeen Texas express way off the trimmer exit coming off the highway",4.8
49,"September 18, 2017",My husband and I went in not expecting to buy today. Didn't think we would get approved but Arvie Fairchild did what he could! And we got what we wanted. If you want to get a new chevy go to all American Chevrolet and ask for Arvie! He is wonderful!! ,5.0
50,"September 14, 2017","My husband was looking for a truck and found a Silverado on line that was at All American Chevrolet in Killeen.  He called to inquire about the truck and spoke to Michael Winfree.  Mike was up front with us and gave us a quote over the phone.  We went to the dealership and saw Mike who was off that day but came to work just to talk to us.  Everything he told us is what we got.  He was a pleasure to work with, very honest and gave us a great deal.  Everyone at the dealership from the new General Manager, to Joe in finance who helped us get a great interest rate and of course Michael who stayed until the end.  I would highly recommend Mike and his gang if you are looking to purchase a vehicle.

51,"September 13, 2017","The last time I purchased a new car it was liked getting all of my teeth pulled at one time. I must say this was by far the best experience I have ever had when buying a new car. Mr. Tyrone Jackson worked his tail off for us. I told him just what I wanted and he got it for me. The color, the style, the make, and most of all the price with payments that I couldn't believed. After the test drive with the entire family we knew that we were getting the right car. Best of all was Mr. Tyrone Jackson and the way he worked for us.",5.0

Both gentlemen were very helpful and patient, and I walked out with a car I love and a smile on my face.",5.0
54,"September 08, 2017","I contacted a few different Mazda dealers in the weeks before buying our nearly-new Mazda from All-American's pre-owned inventory. I also contacted one used car dealership regarding an SUV we were interested in buying to replace our near-new Tahoe (to help offset the expense of the new Mazda). All of them were at least an hour to four hours' drive from us (we had only a few cars that were our color/options), and all were pretty unwilling/unfriendly/useless to talk turkey with over the phone. They wanted us to bring our trade to them to appraise it (all we wanted was a no-commitment, fully conditional FAIR appraisal), and acted like the ""True Car"" pricing I got was their bottom-dollar price. Very frustrating. 

Four years ago, we traded our Chevy HHR SS in on that Tahoe, got financially bludgeoned on the deal, and weren't treated especially nicely in the process. Again, we had tight parameters, and made the mistake of telling them we'd had trouble finding what we wanted, so they refused to deal at all.

So by the time I found this particular near-new Mazda at All-American, I was already pretty mad. Their internet sales specialist contacted me (through True Car), and when I told him of my experiences with car shopping lately, he seemed like he was just going to give us the same old runaround. So we disengaged from him and just bit the bullet, making the 150 mile trip to Killeen to see this nearly-mythical meteor-gray Miata.

When we got there, I asked to speak with Clint Schrick, the Sales Manager. He came out immediately and listened courteously to our story, said he loved to deal with buyers like us who knew what we wanted, needed, and could pay, and really worked hard for a couple of hours to try to find a way for us to trade our 2012 Tahoe on a less-nice/expensive truck and use the proceeds to fund the Miata, or at least most of it. He found a way that would have been pretty cool, let us go get a bite to eat with the truck he had in mind while we thought about it, and even offered to let us take it to a hotel overnight since we were there so late and so far from home.

But we just love our Tahoe too much to trade it for what Clint showed us was all any dealer would pay, so we decided to keep it and just buck up for the Miata, mostly because of the way Clint structured the deals/prices when we were talking about doing a 2/1 swap, and because he, in an abundance of honor and courtesy, honored the same significantly discounted price for the Miata even though we didn't trade or take the cheaper SUV we'd discussed taking as part of the deal.

Not only Clint, but salesman Michael Long were never less than extremely warm, friendly, cordial, and honest with us, and this dealership is/was BY FAR THE BEST with whom I've ever dealt. My purchase history includes Kansas City's Mosse Nissan and a Chevy dealership whose name escapes me, Springfield, Missouri's Reliable Chevrolet, St. Louis' Behlmann Pontiac, and Grapevine, TX's Classic Chevrolet. (Behlmann was great, too, but we did that whole deal over the phone, and I don't think the deal was as good as for me as this, given their situation with that car...)",5.0

Will definitely recommend them to anyone looking for a new or maybe used vehicle.

65,"August 17, 2017","I was just thinking of purchasing a new vehicle but had no intention of buying until I'd done more research. I started with All American Chevrolet of Killeen as I have been using their service department for a few years and am very happy with the service I have gotten. I started my search online late on a Sunday evening and received a call from Tyrone Jackson shortly after filling in some information. We chatted a few minutes and agreed to meet the next day. I was 30 minutes early but Mr. Jackson greeted me and called me by name before even being introduced! He was friendly but always professional during our interactions. We talked a little more and Tyrone Jackson was patient with my questions and really appeared to both know and believe in his products. Mr. Jackson was polite, never pushy, and did not try to oversell; he gave me the information I needed and let me process it fully before I made any decisions. He told me what was happening and what to expect at every stage of my process of actually buying a new 2017 Chevrolet Trax. Mr. Jackson was honest and helpful throughout the whole process and was one of the deciding factors I used to make the decision to buy that day instead of looking further. He even cleared all the junk out of my trade in and put it neatly in my new Trax! He was sincerely happy for me and showed me how things worked in my new car before we said goodbye for now. He assured me he would be available to answer any questions I might have in the future and I truly believe I could call at any time and Mr. Jackson would be there for me.
I would also like to mention Joe McCartney who did the financing part of my transaction. Mr. McCartney, too, was friendly, professional, patient, helpful but never pushy or trying to oversell his products. Mr. McCartney thoroughly explained a myriad of options available to me and he patiently allowed me to process all the information before I made my decision. 
Both Tyrone Jackson and Joe McCartney made my buying experience at All American Chevrolet of Killeen a pleasure. I have bought several cars in my lifetime. While I have dealt with competent staff before this is the first time I have written a positive review. I would highly recommend All American Chevrolet of Killeen, Mr. Tyrone Jackson and Mr. Joe McCartney to anyone.",5.0

101,"March 25, 2017","I feel the need to tell my story.. Just a week ago, I got in a car accident, it was my first car, I felt my world was coming to an end, I had a few panic and anxiety attacks. I loved that car, I mean, I worked so hard for it by myself at a very young age, it was my pride, my baby. After endless stress and constant anxiety on how to solve my situation now that my beloved car was a 'total loss' and only had 7 days left using the rental car, otherwise, no car, no job (I work in Austin).. I went to the bank and was just chatting with one of the front desk agents and her Manager referred me to the All American Chevrolet in Killeen and to ask for Eddie Camacho... I have to say, he's an excellent salesman. He was understanding, super friendly, kind, professional and just wonderful in every aspect of the word. His way of approaching my situation made me feel at ease and it was like talking to a close friend instead of a salesman; comforting. If it wasn't for him and how he went out of his way to help me in my situation, I'd still be stressing all over the place, seeing no way out. So now I own my very first NEW 2017 car with 0 down payment! Will definitely refer family and/or family to the dealership and recommend Eddie Camacho.

It was just for the belt and a new fob and to check the ac.  I went back in 3 days to find nothing had been done. I was told the parts just came in when i ask what parts i was told it was for a recall that i did not say they could do or was i told about it. So another 4 days goes by and i was told it was ready when i got there to pick it up it was not. they were having trouble getting it apart to do the recall i did not tell them to. The next day i tried to contact the service manager who did not return my calls. I picked up the care that day only to find a day later that it now stalls on take off and flashes a SERVICE COLUMN LOCK seems what ever the did on the recall messed up something. Now i have to take off work again to drop it off Monday the 20th of March to get it fixed.John A Feamster 254-833-4802

What kind of dealership especially a Chevrolet dealership would require an appointment for just an oil change? I've never experienced this in my life at any franchise dealership they are preety much turning away the customer. Besides it being a Chevrolet dealership with no quick lube which is ridiculous their customer service also sucks. They , being the service receptionist and the service writers are very rude and very non accommodating to the customer. I called twice and asked to speak to the service manager the receptionist obviously trying to screen calls asked for my name I asked her to page for the service manager instead of sending me to his direct line because obviously he would not pick up. So I assumed she paged him and there I set on hold... For over eight minutes then the line disconnected..:(
So after the experience I received today I decided All American Chevrolet will never receive business from me and I will take my money elsewhere. I heard there is a nice customer friendly and family owned dealership in Temple. Please don't waist your time and money going to a dealership that doesn't value their customers. I hope someone from high up in Lithia reads this and investigates this awful treatment of paying customers and corrects the problem as I know they will because all of their calls are recorded.

I went in and asked what they could do and they were going to charge me for a diagnostic. I wrote some reviews online and they finally decided to do something. They offered me a rental car while my car sat in their shop for a month. A MONTH. They told me to just come pick it up. So that's what I did.
This is a place that specializes in Chevys and they couldn't figure out what was wrong with my car.
I take my car into a general repair shop for a diagnostic. In ONE DAY, they tell me what's wrong with my car.
I tell everyone I see who's looking for a car to stay away from that place.

We took it back to the dealer and they quickly pushed our vehicle to the front of the line. It was only a loose seal and they were able to repair it and return the vehicle to us the next morning. In the meantime, they did provide a new Chevy Malibu rental for us.  Regardless, our entire experience was a pleasant, easy, and positive one.

The car had several expensive problems, and working with the employees was a nightmare. About a week ago, we were called by All American Chevrolet in Killeen, and they told us they were interested in buying my wife's car (2009 Chevy Cobalt). We went in very skeptical, and Ozzie Acosta was our salesman. Right off the bat, we felt much better with this dealership and sales team. We paid $6500 for her Cobalt, and they gave us $5500 for a trade in (I honestly thought we would be lucky to get $3000). We decided to upgrade to a 2013 Sonata hybrid, and Ozzie was great. We had trouble deciding at first, so he let us have the car the whole day free of dealer employees, so we could decide if it was right for us. When we came back 10 minutes before closing and told him we wanted to buy, he did not hesitate in getting our deal done. He also got our monthly payments within $50 of where we wanted to be, and he got us a GREAT interest rate (2.9%).  This dealership was also about $500 below the KBB estimate for the price of a 2013 Sonata hybrid, and that we could tell, there aren't any problems with the vehicle.

I used KBB to see what the fair price of the vehicle would be in a fair condition and All-American was $1000 lower.  I test drove the truck and looked it completely over, and found only minor issues (small chips in the paint and other minor cosmetics.)  My salesman, FRED NORMAN, was a pleasure to work with.  He definitely wanted to make the sale, but did not feed me lines of bull crap while he was at it.  If I am still in Killeen when I need another vehicle, this will be one of the first places I call.

As icing on the cake, when we finally concluded that they couldn't come down to my offer, instead of shaking hands and politely saying they couldn't go that low, Jim Kaminska literally yelled at me from 30 feet away across the showroom floor (in front of all other customers/employees), saying ""Oh, you're trying to help us get the sale? By low-balling us for 2,000 dollars less than the car is worth? Oh YEAH, that's helping us. That's like buying this new truck (pointing) for 20 grand."" And then walked away.

192,"July 06, 2013","We purchase our vehicle along with a lifetime service plan at a Lithia dealership in Anchorage, Alaska. When we moved, we were pleasantly surprised to learn that there was a Lithia dealership in Killeen, which is about an hour drive from where we now live. I took the car in for a routine oil change on a Monday at 7am (I called the day before and the service advisor said they open at 7am - but when I showed up at 7 she said ""yes, we open at 7, but the technician doesn't get here until 7:45), planning to make it back to work by 9am. 

The tech came around to get my car a little after 8, and drove by in front of the main waiting area. He turned a little too sharply and bumped up against a curb/grassy area in the parking lot, but instead of backing up and going around, HE GASSED IT AND DROVE OUR CAR OVER THE CURB, THROUGH THE GRASS, AND OFF THE CURB ON THE OTHER SIDE. He hit it very hard, and it is NOT an off-road vehicle by any stretch of the word. It's a small crossover/SUV. The service advisor was out there when it happened (and everyone saw it happen since it happened directly in front of the waiting area, which is solid windows) and she said something to him, like ""What are you doing??"" He took the car to the back and I sat there, frustrated and wondering what else they were doing to my wife's car. 

When they brought the car back out about 45 minutes later, the service advisor gave me my keys and paperwork, but didn't mention the curb situation, probably hoping I didn't see it happen. So I asked her to please make a note on my service record and asked if they checked to make sure there was no damage. She said ""Yes, he checked and everything's fine."" So I walked around to the front to find the entire plastic panel behind the bumper cracked and hanging in place. 

So I showed it to her, and she went and got the Service Manager, who let me go back in the garage with him while he inspected it on the lift. When it was up on the lift, he noticed that none of the bolts holding on the skid plate (or whatever it's called) were tightened. He tightened them all with his fingers then went and got a wrench and finished tightening them. I would have made it about a mile (maybe) before the whole thing fell off. This was probably more concerning to me than the fender damage. Clearly they did not put much care or effort into their work while they were changing my oil. So at this point, I'm assuming they probably did a half-way job on everything they touched. 

The service manager was very apologetic and went to order the fender piece for me, so I waited in the front for a few more minutes, but told the service advisor that I really needed to get to work (I was already late and ended up having to take a half-day of leave). I asked her to please call me as soon as she knew anything, because my wife and two kids had to take that car to visit her family 600 miles away and they were leaving in 5 days. She assured me she would call as soon as she heard from the service manager about the part. 

I waited about 4 hours and finally called her, and she said ""Oh, I was going to call you when the part gets here on Thursday."" I was already frustrated and stressed, and it bothered my that she didn't call when she said she was going to. She said she would call me Thursday and schedule the repair for Friday (because my wife was leaving for her trip on Saturday).

So, Thursday at 2:30pm I still hadn't heard from her, so I called her direct number and left a voicemail. An hour later, she still hadn't called, so I called again. She answered, asked my name, and asked me to wait while she checked. She came back on the phone and asked my my name again, then said ""hold on"" again. Then she came back on the phone, asked me what kind of car it was, and when I told her, she said ""We don't have anything on file. Are you sure you ordered the part from All American Chevrolet?"" 

At this point, I was completely out of patience. Not only did she NOT call me ONCE the whole week, but now it was late Thursday afternoon and I still hadn't even been able to ask my boss for time off because I hadn't been given a definite time/date by the service advisor. 

The service advisor failed to dial my phone number once the whole week, and if I hadn't called her Thursday afternoon I'm 100% positive she wouldn't have called at all. She didn't even know who I was even after I gave her my name twice, car model, AND left her a voicemail!

She told me to bring the car by the next day and they would get it done as soon I dropped it off. I asked her if they would mind washing and detailing it while I wait, and she said yes, that seemed reasonable given the amount of time and money their negligence had already cost me. 

So I took another 4 hours of leave from work, drove an hour back to Killeen and waited for them to fix it, which they did quickly and correctly. The service manager took me back to inspect it, then told me it would be a a few more minutes while they cleaned it up. So about an hour later the service advisor brought it back around. I didn't mind waiting because I figured they must be doing a very thorough detail job. But as soon as I got in the car to leave, I noticed that they HADN'T EVEN TOUCHED THE INSIDE! Nothing! Nothing cleaned, nothing wiped down, not even vacuumed. 

So I went back in, waited in line for the service advisor AGAIN, and asked her if they forgot to do the inside. She seemed very surprised and apologetic, and took it back again. Five minutes later she brought it back and said she personally helped the vacuum it. Which was already disappointing because she told me the day before they would detail it - not just vacuum it. So I opened the back hatch and it STILL HAD NOT BEEN VACUUMED! It was exactly the way it was before I dropped it off. Grass, dirt, small rocks, dog hair. It's not like they missed a spot - they literally did not open the hatch. 

When I pointed it out (not that I had to) her response was ""yeah, our vacuum isn't very good."" Seriously!?!? She had just told me that she PERSONALLY helped the guys vacuum it, which was clearly not true - and then she tells me that the reason it's still filthy is because their vacuum isn't very good?? I was completely disappointed and insulted. She asked if I wanted her to take it back again and I said no thanks, I'll do it myself at home. 

So, all told, I took a full day off work and drove 4 hours because of their negligence and lack of oversight. It's not like they made a mistake and then took ownership of it. The tech that wrecked my wife's car was completely negligent and disrespectful. And once he had it on the lift he left bolts undone. And who knows what else.

The only bright spot was that the service manager took the time to meet with me for about 30 minutes, and I think he was genuine and sincerely wanted to make it right. But immediately after that meeting is when the service advisor brought me back my filthy car and then lied about vacuuming it. 

There is a serious disconnect between what the service manager expects from his employees and what they're actually doing. I'm extremely disappointed and frustrated that I can't trust them to do the basic maintenance I already paid for when I bought the car from Lithia. ",2.0
193,"February 18, 2013","I recently took my 2010 Malibu in for an oil change/tire rotation as well as a severe leak in my sunroof.  They were very courteous and kind at first but problems began after my first visit.  I was greeted by Josh.  He immediately took my vehicle into the bay and within a couple hours informed me that parts (seal & headliner)would need to be ordered to complete repairs to my sunroof.  He informed me he would call back once the parts arrived. Two weeks went by without a phone call.  I finally decided to call the dealership to ask what the hold up was and Mindy informed me that Josh was no longer employed with the company but my parts had been there for over a week.  She stated that it went unnoticed since Josh was the primary service representative handling my concerns.  I took the vehicle in only to receive it in a condition that was much worse than when i brought it in.  The mechanic who installed the headliner must have been the same mechanic who did my oil change/tire rotation because there were numerous oil stains throughout the new headliner.  Above and beyond that, every trim piece holding the headliner in place was loose and many were off track which caused the headliner to droop excessively.  I returned to the dealership once again only to have the seat cushions in the back seat damaged as well as my dome light.  The headliner was still in the same condition as when it was first delivered to me, dirty and droopy but with many additional problems as well.  The Service manager assured me they would replace the headliner once again but this time they would wear gloves during install as well as replace the dome light fixture.  I was once again told that they would contact me immediately once the parts arrived. I have contacted them repeatedly over the past week and have yet to be informed that the parts have arrived.  In addition to their incompetence and their total lack of concern, I am now having to deal with electrical problems with all the dome lighting in the car as well as the trunk.

204,"May 25, 2011",They go the extra mile for you every time. They aren't going to put you in a vehicle you can't afford or doesn't fit you. They also keep their word. I trust them to do the job right the first time every time. There is also a warmth that the employes have that make you feel comfortable. ,5.0
205,"April 30, 2011","This is our 5th new vehicle we have purchased and the customer service has always been superb! When the owner takes the time to personally thank you for your purchase  that says it all-they truly care about the customer! That is one reason why we keep coming back.  Another reason we continue to buy at Connell is the fantastic service department!  They are friendly, fast, efficient and make you feel like you are family! Overall Connell Chevrolet provides enhanced customer service with high quality care that is surpassed by none!  I am proud to drive a Connell Chevrolet vehicle!

Thanks for making us feel special!  David & Susan Fergus",5.0
206,"March 21, 2011","I have purchased Chevrolets from Connell Chevrolet for over 20 years.  I have always been completely satisfied with their sales and services employees. 

The new car sales department always finds me the exact vechile I want. 

When I walk into the dealership, I am addressed by name every time.  It is the same way with the service department.  I feel like I am a very important customer to them and want my complete satisfaction.

When I have needed other services, from the service department, they always call me to discuss the problem (and the expected cost) and get my approval before continuing with the work.

My daughter, and son-in-law, purchased a used car from Connell and they also have been completely satisfied.

207,"March 19, 2011","Arlan delivered my car, which I had selected from their inventory on-line.  It was perfectly clean and ready.  He spent the time with me to show me where all of the switches and levers were, where to find all of the material about the car, about the diagnostics and the on-board computer, and then he sat with me in the car and set up the On-Star account.  He gave me a reminder of free oil change at 5000 miles at the dealership, to familiarize me with the service department.

They gave me a good price and a more-than-fair trade-in allowance for a high mileage Suburban.

Overall, my experience was terrific, and I never felt rushed.",5.0
208,"March 16, 2011","The reason for going to Connell Chevrolet is because of the superior customer service that we received from Mindy in the Service department . The friendly and concerned attitude has kept us coming back. While geting our Suburban serviced one day we went to look at a vehicles on the car lot. A salesman named Ron came out and introduced himself and offered his assistance. He was not pushy,but very friendly and showed us the vehichles that we liked. We were treated with respect and kindness by Ron and Mindy. We wanted to make sure that they were recognized. We are business owners ourselves and it is  very difficult to find great customer service!",5.0
209,"March 09, 2011","Connell Chevrolet offers great customer service, competative pricing and quality work.  Anytime I have needed service they have treated us very well and I have always been more than satisfied with the service.  The staff are all friendly and courteous. They have my business and I do not hesitate to recommend them to anyone.",5.0
210,"February 24, 2011","I have found the service department at Connell Chevrolet in Killeen to be a very positive experience.  Frank (the service manager) and Mindy (the service rep I dealt with)were both awesome.  They answered my questions thoroughly, called me back to give me additional information that I had requested, and made sure that I understood the repairs needed.  Like many other women, I don't know much about cars.  That's why I want to do business with a dealership that I KNOW that I can TRUST.  I have had other repairs done previously at Connell and they stood behind their work and were quick to help me with a warranty issue.  The service department employees are knowledgeable and friendly.  Their customer service is outstanding.     ",5.0
211,"February 24, 2011",They both took the time to find the color that I wanted on my 2011 Tahoe. both of them where friendly and courtious. Will purchase another car from them. Also great that Mrs. Connell was there and thanks us for purchase another chevrolet and from her dealership. ,5.0
212,"February 18, 2011","Truly the best car buying experience I've ever gone through.  I did my homework. I went on line checked out pricing from several other dealerships and differnt brands, spoke to other dealers by phone and I had my own financing already approved.  Without any hassle they had the best price plus gave the best financing option.  First time I have ever purchased a new vehicle and felt confident I received the best deal possible.",5.0
