0,"June 24, 2020",If you trade in a vehicle make sure to watch to see if they actually pay it off.  Deal has been funded for weeks but they are just playing games and still haven’t paid off trade.  Check is going out today lol we shall see....Already made 1 extra payment to trade in let see if they actually pay it off.  Vinny the salesman was great but obviously management is just trying to make a few extra $$$ (a bit crooked if you ask me). This is not just a one time deal as we have many friends and family members that have had the same issue with this dealership. Have bought many company vehicles without trade ins from this dealership and never had an issue.  If you try to reach management or finance department your emails and voicemails will just go unanswered.  We shall see if they make this right.,1.0

3,"May 28, 2020","Service department it terrible, I bought in my 2005 Chrysler PT Cruiser to have the convertible top checkout, because the top wasn't coming down. My service advisor Chase, a nice guy, he let me know that it would be a $185 charge to see what causing the problem, then I get a call from Chase saying they need a additional $400 to keep looking into the problem, which I never heard of this before charging someone to extra for looking for a problem. So, I told Chase to discontinue the service and I'll come pickup my car, when I get there the next morning Chase had my diagnose on the convertible top, which two motors stop working not letting the top down, and the cost to repair around $1200 which I'll wait later to repair, I'll take the car back home. When they drove up to the front service driveway, I notice the Left side back window was down, I with to try let it back up, the window wouldn't come up. So, I with back to Chase with this problem, and he with to talk with the tech that work on the  car, and he told me that the tech could not get the window back up, so he just left the window down without telling the advisor and just give the back to me that way. Then, the service mgr. came up to me and told me that I have to pay for it to have it repaired, and blame me for having the window down, which wasn't true, all windows were up, and then he told me I had a unreasonable attitude about me trying to see if they could get the window back up, no they wanted to charge me for a problem  I didn't bring the car for repair. Be careful at this Dealership, the service department are Con Artist.",1.0
4,"May 21, 2020","The amount of unprofessional repairs, advice & lack of communication with this department is UNREAL. I have no idea how this place is still in business with how they treat customers & your vehicle. We bought a car here a few months ago without ANY issues. The sales staff are awesome! If you ever need repairs, service, or diagnosis, GOOD LUCK. The operating manager takes no accountability for his advisors or ""techs"". These people are hourly workers who couldn't care less about your vehicle or concerns. You might have better luck going to the Walmart auto shop. I have run into issue after issue with these clowns. Not worth the headache!",1.2
5,"May 14, 2020","As always, a dealer is only as good as their service....and service is only as good as the service advisor. I pass by another Ram dealer to go to Frisco Ram for Robbie. Robbie is the only person I will go to for the past 4 years. He is the best and as a business owner, makes me feel like I am his only customer. ",5.0

8,"May 04, 2020","Whenever I come in for service here, I'm always treated as a VIP. It was great seeing and working with Cody. He is phenomenal and goes way beyond the cal of duty in terms of customer service. While you're vehicle is being serviced, Cody keeps you abreast of the status and asks if there is anything else that you need during the interim.  They're always running some savings deal that he will inform you of as well. Once your service is done, Cody makes sure that his customers get the VIP exit by having your vehicle parked just outside the Service Department. If it's cool outside your AC is cold and if its cold outside your heat is running for you. Please do what y'all have to do to keep Cody there (BIG BONUS) and happy.

I also enjoyed meeting and talking with Brad (the head Service ""Boss""). He meets, greets and talks with customers  who are getting their car serviced. He definitely has a knack for customer service. He is also a keeper.",5.0

10,"April 12, 2020","I received absolutely stellar service from Augustine Flores and Sales Manager Stephen Bruneau! I’ve been coming to this dealership for several years, but this was by far the best sales experience I’ve had, and not just with Jeep dealerships. They were knowledgeable, courteous, personable and genuine, with absolutely no sales gimmicks or pressure. I’ve shopped around for months, but received the best deal that was possible from these gentlemen, for the vehicle that I wanted. Cannot recommend them highly enough. Sales process was smooth and easy from start to finish, and I could not be happier with a sales crew or the vehicle I got! ",5.0

14,"March 23, 2020","I purchased a new vehicle from them in December.  Apparently they hit my credit report with 7+ inquiries, depending on which credit report you're looking at.  I go this weekend go see about doing a trade in on a different vehicle.  They couldn't meet me where I wanted, so I left and went to a different dealership.  They texted me while I was there that they would meet me where I needed to be, so I left the second dealership and went back.  They have already ran my Experian there and can see that I meet the criteria for the special rate. Then I'm told we're waiting on ""special approval"" for the special rate. Why?  2 out of 3 of my credit reports had a score of 700 and 722.  One was a 698.  I was told by the finance guy that ""they are so buy the book - we Always use Experian but their system is down so they went bureau shopping on  you and unfortunately the Equifax is 698, so we just need manager approval from their side, and they don't want to do it because of all the recent activity on  your report (keep in mind, that was from 3 months ago when they ran my credit and excessive 7+ times for my new vehicle purchase).   Then all of the sudden it's ""Great news!  We got the approval"", and I am taken to the office to sign the paperwork.  Oh wait, just kidding.  The guy gets pulled out within a few minutes and the next thing you know, his manager comes in and says ""well, we got the texted approval from our rep, but since it's so late we can't get anyone at Chrysler financial to answer the phone....so there's nothing we can do"".

They wasted an entire day of my weekend.  I lost a good deal on a vehicle at a different dealership because of this dealerships lies and manipulations.  The above is a much abridge version but I was told the entire way it was a sure thing, that ""just waiting on the manager to get back to the office, just waiting on this, etc"".  They jerked me around for HOURS and then go as far as to start printing to finance documents to have me sign before telling me ""oh sorry.....you're not eligible"".  ",1.8

19,"November 25, 2019","If you have a different dealer to use I'd go there. I've left multiple messages regarding a repair on my car over a month ago now and they won't ever return my calls. It was like pulling a tooth when they had my car as well to get ahold of them to figure out if I had to pay for my rental over and over. They made me pay for a rental when it was their fault my car was there for two weeks. They said they had to wait on a third party to verify what they found (which is fine) then when they ordered parts the wrong parts came (I understand this too) but why force me into paying for my rental when I could have had my car finished much sooner. There's other issues as well so I guess I'm looking for a different dealership now, one that'll actually return my calls. On top of it all I was dealing with the service manager this whole time. He is the one that won't return calls or anything.

To add to this I had an issue with my air conditioning cutting out after a little while if it was not in fan speed 3 or 4. Well this got old very fast when you either had to have it blasting on you or off. They never could find the problem. They were fine at first thing to help me out but then they eventually charged me ~$500 for a repair they were available sure about. My car still is doing the same thing. They still can't find the problem. So I was like I should get my ~$500 back since that wasn't my problem. Haha yeah right. That went on for a few months. Then after that is when the above paragraph started happening. They quit returning my messages. In fact I called the other day to ask a simple question (btw I gave up on even talking about my a/c now, just dealing with it) and the receptionist answered and too my info and still haven't heard a thing. It's like I'm black listed because they can't figure out my vehicles issue. I've never had a problem like this before. And I've raved about everyone down here since moving here. Not anymore.",1.0

22,"August 28, 2019",This dealership was unable to get their paperwork straight and has asked that we return twice after purchasing the vehicle to complete additional paperwork/forms that they did not fill out properly on the initial sale.

25,"April 27, 2019","I took my vehicle there about 3 weeks ago because it started acting funny.  As soon as I started the engine, it started accelerating on its own to about 40 MPH.  Frisco CDJR came up with a diagnosis as a ""faulty gas pedal"" and charged me $376.00  Apparently a faulty gas pedal is not covered under the certified pre owned warranty.

About 3 days after I got the vehicle, the same issue happened again.  The vehicle started accelerating on its own to about 40 MPH.  This happened when my wife was picking up my infant son.

I called and spoke with a manager in the service department.  He said that the vehicle needs to be towed and stated ""I will take care of the towing expense"".
This time the diagnosis was ""faulty wiring harness"".  Total cost $2031 plus taxes and shop fees.
Again though the vehicle accelerates on its own and is a serious safety issue, I was told this is not covered under the warranty.

Total cost after taxes and fees came to $2271.  

I asked that for the $376 I paid for the ""Misdiagnosis"" of a faulty gas pedal be deducted and I was told yes.

When I picked up the vehicle, not only the $376 was not deducted, but I was charged $80 for the tow, which I was told by a manager that he would personally take care of.

The manager sent me a text stating the he paid for the renal vehicle while mine was in the shop and that an additional $117 was reduced.  Total lies.

If the vehicle was diagnosed correctly the first time, there would not be a rental charge.

I am never taking my vehicle to Frisco CDJR again.  People there are incompetent and lie.

26,"April 26, 2019","Where do I start... I dropped my car off on a Sat 3/23. Ron told me that they wouldn't be able to look at it until the following Tuesday. I understood giving it was the weekend. Tuesday 3/26 I talked to Ron and he said that it would be ready the following Tuesday 4/2. Ok fine. It's a transmission and water pump so I figured 3-4 days maybe even 5 would be understandable. Called Monday 4/1 to ask if I could have the airbag fixed due to recall. He states that they haven't even gotten to my car yet and that he ""hopes"" they can get to it this week. It's now Thursday 4/4 and called just to see if they have even started yet and possibly get an accurate ETA. I can't even get a call back despite the 2 messages I have left on Ron's VM. So I've gotten 1 call since they have had my car only to give me a completely false ETA. I originally took my car to #DallasDodge and they were immediately ready and able to fix my car. However due to the warranty I got through the dealership it required I bring it back to #FriscoDodge. If you guys were that backed up or short handed, you should have recommended to and worked with the warranty provider that you partner with that I could take it to another dealership and I would have taken my car back to #DallasDodge and would have had my car back by now. So finally the following Tues 4/9 I get a text saying my car was finished. Mind you I have not spoken to Ron since 4/1. I go and pick my car up and not 20 miles from the dealership my transmission goes completely out. Check Engine light comes on and I cant drive over 30mph. Which indicates they gave me my car in worse condition than when I gave it to them. Had it towed back that night. now Wednesday 4/10 no one has given me a call to let me know anything. Considering you all did not do your job correctly and I am still out of a car, you would think I'd become a bit of a priority. After all of that, I picked up my car the following week. (5days later) only to get all the way home to find out that my car no longer wants to shift out of first gear. They had to once again tow my car back to the dealership. Then it was another 5 days until I was able to pick my car up. So 3 weeks of no car and having to come up with ways to work on the fly, driving back and forth to frisco multiple times (I both live and work 45 mins away with no traffic not to mention gas) You would think at some point especially after not fixing my car the first 2 times they would have offered a mode of transportation. I've seen good reviews for Ron unfortunately I didn't experience any of his highlighted customer service until my car was returned the 2nd time. On top of all that, throughout this ordeal I noticed that there was a descrepency with my odometer reading on my car fax before I bought the car. I went to salesman Chris Shultz to voice my concern. The next day he calls me and directs me the support link on carfax to forward my complaint. Why would I have to do the leg work to fix a mistake that happened while you had the car? The mere fact that I have to bring my car to #FriscoDodge to get my car fixed makes me cringe. I will gladly pay for a secondary warranty program just to not have to take my car there. The fact that no one would even contact me for updates is horrible customer service in itself. My wife will soon be shopping for a new car and I can promise it won't be from #FriscoDodge

27,"April 08, 2019","My Jeep was scheduled for a service appointment on Wednesday at an early drop-off.  I left it at the dealership earlier than scheduled.  I received  a text within 2 hours of dropping off.  By Friday I had heard no update, so I texted  my contact as requested by the initial text.  Saturday, the text had yet to be responded to, so I called.  My first attempt to call was disconnected after being put on hold.  On my second call, I was told that my Jeep would be looked at on Saturday or Monday, and I would be contacted with an update.  By 5:00 PM Monday, I had not been contacted, so I called.  After a 15 minute hold, I was told I could not be given a status or update.  I asked if I should come pick up my car.  I was told yes, that they close at 7:00 PM.  I picked up my car and took it home having no work completed, no one ever contact me from the dealership for updates or a solution to repair it.  My Jeep is still broken after never being looked at.  I feel that my 6 days without my car was wasted.  As a side note, when I went to pick up my car they could not find my ""file"" either.  I guess I fell through the cracks.",1.8

30,"November 12, 2018","Worse Veterans Day ever!! After negotiating a deal for two days I was told that I wasted their time. Albert the sales person was very professional and went out of his way to make the deal happen. Kyle the manager on the other hand was very disrespectful and belittling. So I submitted my trade on the Frisco Dodge website and asked Kyle why they wouldn’t honor that value if it’s on their website. The vehicle was a demo and I was told from the get go that it would discounted and I qualified for additional savings. After the second night of being there for 3 hours, Kyle finally came out to tell me that no more discounts could be added. So I asked about my military discount that’s advertised and also about the value given for my trade on the website, Kyle said “So! I can’t honor it. Where do you work anyway or do you work?” I asked him what does that matter? Do I look like I can’t afford it? He knows I’m a Veteran! And I should have said that I have held a professional job for 23 years but I let him talk and I should have put my foot down but instead but my tongue. Kyle went off on me in front of a showroom floor full of customers just because I didn’t tell him where I work and I asked for my military discount. Then he proceeded to tell me not to waste his time nor his sales person but never apologized for taking up my time.
What a way to celebrate Veterans Day!!! Please don’t do business with this dealership because they clearly have no respect for your time, Veterans, not saving you money and will be very disrespectful if you don’t agree on their terms.",1.0
31,"August 13, 2018","For anyone in the DFW area or if you know someone up here, DO NOT look to buy a vehicle from Frisco Chrysler Dodge Jeep Ram!  I have never been so turned off by a dealership’s unwillingness to work with me!  It took all afternoon to get the General Sales Manager to call me back after leaving messages with 5 different people.  It took sending a message through the dealership website that wasn’t too nice to get his attention and make him get in touch with me.  Keep in mind I am already a customer, not a new customer, and he talks to me with disregard and condescension.  I am relatively new to sales as an occupation, but even I know you DO NOT treat a current client that way if you want to keep them!!  You cannot tell me that a purchase cannot be undone (especially after only 1.5 business days), you are just unwilling to do anything about it.  I will never, NEVER work with this dealership again, and if you don’t want to be treated as just another line item in the sales ledger instead of a person, you shouldn’t either!!!",1.0
32,"August 09, 2018","I had a previous bad occasion at this service department, however two years later a lot had improved. I showed up without an appointment around 9:30.  I found my battery in my Jeep dead late yesterday.  I got it jump started this morning and drove to the dealer.  Micah 100% took care of me.  It wasn’t like I was out of luck and they didn’t have time for me.  He was able to get me in line for the battery confirmation and replacement.  Prior to doing the work, Micah showed me the installed price.  This was completed in a short time.  The final price was actually a little less than estimated.

34,"August 01, 2018","This is based on me and my boyfriends own personal experience. We got financed for a 2017 Dodge Durango on 7/28. When we went in to see the vehicle it was in the process of being ""detailed"" even though it was listed on a third party site two days prior so we thought that was odd to begin with. Then when the dealer said it was ready to see and take for a drive it had so much leather conditioner or oil it went through my shirt as I sat down. 

The vehicle drove fine and everything it was just the thought it was an all wheel, fully loaded blacktop/technology group packaged SUV that had me very excited not realizing the scope of the damage from the previous owners. It had two and they were rough on it. Anyway fast forward to today 7/31 and we have been trying to start the process of a return being that all the damage and it's condition did not reflect it's  price. On top of that they said that we would have to buy the backup remote starter as the previous owner ""couldn't find it."" That was what really bothered me they didn't offer to replace it, on-the-dealership.

So since this morning there's been a cat and mouse game and them claiming the ""deal is done, plates are being sent out"" which is a blatant lie as we called the bank through which the financing is being done and the bank even said they haven't gotten the paperwork and it could take a week or more and anyone that knows when buying a vehicle, license plates don't go out that fast. It's clear they do not want to take this vehicle back and give us our down payment to find something that will satisfy us. Not worried about customer satisfaction or their reputation.

8/1 Update: Well after my boyfriend and I found a very considerate and true customer loyal dealership to take this vehicle off our hands they found this vehicle was most likely purchased from a rental auction as Frisco left the Enterprise sticker on it so who knows how many people have actually drove this thing and Frisco gets away with it by saying it only had two owners this was never mentioned to us and didn't reflect on the carfax...

After this experience we recommend looking elsewhere and telling friends and family to steer clear of this place. They are not honest and do not care about their customers.",1.0

36,"April 23, 2018","When calling for a price, make sure to ask for the sales person that you will be working with directly, and confirm the price ahead of time, including all associated fees and inspections.  We called ahead and confirmed a price because we didn't want to drive and spend the time if we couldn't get what we want.  When we got to the dealership, it wasn't what was offered.  We walked out immediately, very frustrated.  We may not have been very clear on our intentions, or the sales rep misunderstood, or the sales rep wasn't clear on what the offer was.  Paul (general manager) called us back a little while later and made it right.

44,"January 10, 2018","DO NOT GO HERE!!!  I saw a listed 2018 Jeep online with a competitive posted price, so I called them to inquire additional details.  The internet salesman swore up and down that they had the actual car in their inventory and that the posted price was correct.  So my wife and I drove over right away to check it out in anticipation of purchasing the vehicle.  When we arrived, the “games” began...  1) the Jeep was rhino, NOT black as stated online; 2) a Dallas Cowboy player magically took the Jeep and they couldn’t find him (even with GPS tracking); 3) the posted price was way off since they’d now have to order another similar Jeep via dealership trade; 4) the financed offer we agreed on prior was inconspiculously changed on another sheet at the last minute; and 5) they tried to intentionally skip portions of loan paperwork blaming computer software problems.

Claimed it was the fuel pump (under warranty) and that we also needed some basic service work. Cool. Got the car back within the week.

Car wouldn't start a few days later, on Saturday, October 21, 2017 (our 17th wedding anniversary, btw). Had an appt we could NOT miss that morning and had to get a Lyft there. Service Manager Micah not only lied to us about not being able to find a way to get us a loaner since the only rental car co he'd allow us use was closed (the director confirmed they could've helped us during our conversation Monday), but Micah was so rude on the phone that he almost drove my disabled husband into a delirium episode in the middle of the Historic Downtown Denton Square before my husband gave me the phone. Micah proceeded to lie, talk over me and finally go into CYA mode when I mentioned how my husband's disability makes him easy to take advantage of.

When I say delirium episode, I mean he actually doesn't know who I am after 20 years of knowing each other. Happy anniversary to me.

So, after canceling our anniversary plans, getting stuck eating a burger for our big night out...at 3p, and paying for another Lyft home, my husband had to sleep away the rest of the weekend to recover until they came to get the car Monday morning. We were promised reimbursement for the two Lyft rides, which we haven't received yet. Called us later that afternoon to let us know it was ready to pick up and that they must've installed a faulty fuel pump because that was again the issue. Sure, okay, that can happen. Right?

Picked the car up Tuesday morning. By Thursday afternoon, the car almost wouldn't start. They came and got the car on Thursday night and dropped off a loaner (despite Micah swearing up and down they don't have a loaner program a week ago).

We just heard from them this morning. Can you guess what the issue was? Anyone? Bueller? Yeah...fuel pump. Except this time, Cody told us that the issue was that we'd put bad gas into our car. Here's the thing, we haven't had to put a single drop of gas into our car since before the FIRST time they picked it up and said it was the fuel pump because we haven't had a vehicle that consistently worked long enough to need a fill-up. (Our commute is like 6 miles.)

At this point, I have ZERO confidence that they have any idea why a car we've owned for less than a year continues to have issues starting. Not only do I not recommend bringing your car to this dealership for service, but I can't recommend buying one from them either at this point. Seriously, drive an hour or two out of your way to a Chrysler dealership that at least pretends to care about repeat customers.

I have already completed the survey that was emailed to me a week ago and will now send a more detailed email directly to Chrysler corporate regarding this ongoing situation.

Note: I WILL update this review if they make things right, but I'm so beaten down by their lack of service and compassion for the repeated chaos they've caused in our life that I have severe doubts about whether they care enough to attempt to make this right.",1.0

55,"July 09, 2017","Earlier in the month of June I wrote a stellar review of the Sales Team of Frisco Dodge which I now must ""Retract in Warning"" due to the conclusion of a recently purchased factory ordered Challenger 392 vehicle on June 29th. Once my newly order vehicle came in and the financing stage took place all ethical honest salesman ship went to ""xxxx in a hand basket"". I requested 84 month financing approval before the delivery to estimate my down payment, I have another vehicle I need to purchase a Jeep Grand Cherokee for my college daughter next spring. I was told by one of their Sales Managers due to my credit score, which was over 700, that the best rate available to me from the lender was 4.66% a week before the car came in for delivery from the factory. I then suggested to him that I should personally seek out my own lending because I have had lower rates offered in the past 5 years with 3 previous New Dodge purchases without any question of my credit being an issue. However I was advised in the sincerest way, by that Sales Manager that ""only our dealership can get you the best rate possible because we do so much volume business with these lenders everyday and have a special business relationship with them, and going direct yourself will only end up with a higher rate than the one now offered and I would only be wasting my time"".

So being the ethical trusting business man and Decorated Veteran I am, I took him at his word as being truthful and did not give the rate he offered another thought. Then when the car came in from order and I got into the financing office with their Finance Manager he said the same thing but with a twist.... differently, my daughter a Psychology Major working toward her Masters degree at UT Southwestern caught his statement then, as being different than the one given just a week before when the Sales Manager had deterred me from seeking out my own financing in discussion about getting a lower available rate.  Pressed for time, I signed the paperwork and bought the car along with very unusual pressure to buy (3) different extended warranties, one that cost $1,820 needed due to what was described as the 3 complex computer systems in the Dodge 392 Challenger that may fail at sometime in the future, making me think why would Dodge design a defective vehicle that requires additional warranties within the first 7 years of ownership? But I purchased the warranties with his assurance that I could request a refund if I changed my mind.  Then after the weekend I bought the car I called ""The Mechanic Extended Warranty Company's"" service center and found it to be in Monterrey Mexico, where I was on hold for over 25 minutes just to speak to someone in customer service who said I did not have a warranty in the system! 

Now back to the financing issue, making any false statements of material known fact when dealing with money, or property is the very definition of FRAUD. The absolute best rate that both the Sales and Finance Manager said was available to me at 4.66% due to my credit, was a blatant lie. I called the Credit Union where they financed the vehicle after the weekend, just two business days after the purchase date and found out that if I applied through them directly with them looking at my credit application on file from the Frisco Dodge Dealer I would have received rate of 3.46% for 84 months with no application fees! That over the 84 months of the loan is a savings of over $3,000! 

I further found out that the dealer after getting the approval for me before the vehicle had arrived at the dealership, and rate announced to them from the Credit Union of the available 3.46% marked it up and sold the note back to the Credit Union for a fee plus to spread rate of the difference between the 3.46% and 4.66%, intentionally and falsely misinforming me not once, but several times, by two different Frisco Dodge Managers. Lesson leaned, I should have trusted my first instincts of taking the time to apply for my own financing when the rate of 4.66% sounded far to high for my income and credit score. But I am happy to say that once the Credit Union Management found about about the multiple misstatements and all the false communications provided to me by the Frisco Dodge Team regarding the financing in this transaction they stepped up for me and are now in the process of rewriting the note at the lower qualified rate of 3.46% for the 84 months. Thank you Credit Union for your ethical Customer Care!

That is not all, I have now for the entire week since taking possession of the new car sent seven (7) separate emails to their New Car Sales Director to cancel all three of the warranties purchased after finding out the one with The Mechanic Service Contract is customer serviced out of this country, and the others upon closer inspection and research are basically useless to me for what they covered or protected and still have no response from him on this matter. Warranties purchased at Auto Dealerships by law are refundable and cancel-able upon written request by the consumer, I have been told by both the Texas Attorney Generals Consumer Complaints Office and The Texas Motor Vehicle Enforcement Division in Austin, of which this morning I have filed complaints to both about this whole mess of a new car purchase from Frisco Dodge.

While the Service Department at Frisco Dodge has been great with my last vehicle purchase now one (1) year later, if it takes deceptive sales practices and direct lies to simple questions to purchase a vehicle I can no longer recommend this dealership to anyone..... ""Caveat Emptor"" (Latin phrase for, Let the Buyer Beware). I am certain that other Dodge dealerships in the Dallas / Ft Worth area have both ethical sales practices rather than thinking the consumer is stupid or uneducated and won't find out the truth, which inevitably always comes to light in business. Do your due diligence before you buy a Dodge, to find the dealer you can trust, I myself even if they now offered me a FREE vehicle after this experience to go back to Frisco Dodge would not even consider accepting it, for fear that something hidden and supposedly unknown to me would be wrong with the offer.

67,"March 07, 2017","This place doesn't even deserve one star!!!  This is a long review so I apologize in advance but I've never been so upset with a business before!  
I became a first time owner of a brand new Jeep Grand Cherokee Overland Summit in 2012.  We lived in Coppell at the time and drove all the way to Spring, Tx to get the exact exterior/interior color I wanted.  We were VERY GOOD about having our car serviced at the appropriate times and because of our location we chose Lewisville CDJR and always had great customer service.  Well we relocated a year ago and began using Frisco CDJR since it is more convenient, so we thought.  Less than a year ago we replaced the two front tires at Frisco CDJR.  Almost 2 months ago I took the jeep in because it was making a noise.  The jeep has 75,000 miles on it now and we're wanting to trade it in.  I told the service guy that I needed them to fix whatever was causing the noise.  Almost 1 1/2 months later I finally get the jeep back.  The repair that was causing the noise was $300.  They had originally told me that the rack and pinyon needed to be replaced and this is what was causing the noise so total out of pocket was over $1800!  That being said,  I was just happy to get my jeep back.  Well as soon as I left the dealership I felt something wasn't right so I told my husband about it and he drove it that weekend.  He said that maybe it just needs to get broken in,  meaning the parts I guess.  Well it continued to drive crazy especially one day when it was raining.  I thought I was gonna crash a few times.  It's as if they put the new parts on and didn't align and/or stableize it.  Well I took the jeep back in and let my service guy know that it's not driving right.  He drove it around the parking lot and admitted that it didn't seem right.  Then he got some young technician who had actually worked on the vehicle to take it for a drive.  This guy returned and had the service guy tell me that it was the air suspension and it needed to be replaced.  I knew that didn't sound right so I left and let my husband drive it again.  He agreed that something is dangerously wrong.  Today I took it to the Lewisville CDJR and the extremely pleasant and helpful service guy pointed out my front tires and I was appalled!  They were so balled that metal was sticking out of them!  These are the tires we purchased less than a year ago!  He concurred that the guys at Frisco CDJR must've put in the new rack and pinyon and didn't balance/align the vehicle which caused this problem.  We purchased two new front tires and had them aligned and problem solved!  Well except the fact that we're out another $600!!  I drove from the dealership in Lewisville,  straight to the dealership in Frisco and spoke to the service manager.  I got nowhere with him!  I'll be taking them to small claims court!  I might not win but at least they'll have to lawyer up and show up and I will feel some kind of vindication.",1.0
68,"March 01, 2017","I was going to give them ZERO stars but I’m giving Shawn Swenson a chance to make it right.  They have a vehicle that I was interested in but there were only 4 pics of it online and none were of the interior.  I sent multiple emails to see if I could get more pics of the vehicle but to avail.  I received several emails saying “Thank you for showing interest in the vehicle, I know that you have been speaking with my team.”  I never spoke to anyone!  After almost a week of getting generic emails I called and spoke with Megan who informed me that the car was available and at the dealership.  I scheduled an appointment that was 2 hours later and was informed that a salesperson would contact me.  I was contacted by Byron 5 minutes later and he confirmed the car was there.  I get there and Byron informs me that he is with another customer and points me in the general direction of the car.  I walk the lot looking for this car and it is nowhere to be found.  I inform Byron who informs me that the car was loaned out.  I’m not pleased because 2 hours before 2 people tell me the car is there.  Come to find out they never went outside to make sure.  Byron tells me to wait so I stand around for another 20 minutes wondering what I’m waiting around for.  It’s not like he’s going to make the car magically appear.  He tells me that it has been loaned out to a customer whose car is in the shop and it’s in Waxahachie but they can have them bring it back and have it ready later that day.  What?  Who are you going to tell a customer to bring a car back that is 60 miles away.  Didn’t make sense.  I asked to speak to a manager so I waited another 10 minutes.  Byron was talking to a young guy, not the manager, and they were smiling.  As Byron goes to talk to the manager this guy walks my me smiling and says “having a good day?” which I reply “no” and he keeps walking.  He knew I wasn’t happy which made me more furious.  I speak to the manager who apologizes and tells me they can have the car back in a couple of hours.  I told him that I didn’t live close by and could not do that.  He offered to fill my tank up which I refused because I wanted to see the car.  I asked him and Byron to have the General Manager, Shawn Swenson, call me the following Monday morning.  Monday rolls around and no call from Shawn.  I did get a call from Megan wondering why I didn’t make it to my appointment.  I informed her that I did and the car was not there.  I asked her to have Shawn call me.  I decided to call Shawn but got voicemail.  I left a message to call me.  Wednesday rolls around and no call.  I called again and left him a message.  I called and spoke to Byron to see if Shawn was there which he told me that he was.  Byron told me that no one has called me and wanted to leave me alone because I did not have a good experience.  HELLO!!!! That’s the main reason to call a customer.  Customer service 101.  I asked him if the car was loaned out to a customer or did an employee have it because it didn’t make sense.  He said he didn’t know.  Anyways, I still haven’t received a call from Shawn.  I guess you can’t expect good customer service when the GM refuses to provide it.

71,"February 16, 2017","My wife and I bought our 2015 Dodge Ram 2500 at this dealership and while in the finishing moments of signing paperwork with the finance manager we purchased extended warranties and maintenance plans.   We mentioned that our experience with Porcshe and Mercedes Benz maintenance plans in the past covered everything from oil changes fluid changes basically everything would be covered except obvious parts due to wear such as tires, belts and brake pads.   They are assured us that the maintenance plan we were getting would cover the same.
At 30k miles  when we took my truck into drop it off for an oil change they told me that it would cost over $900.   When I told him we had the maintenance plan they said it only covered the oil change.  That fuel filter and differential fluid needed to be changed.  When I questioned why would I purchase a maintenance plan that covers only oil changes for $1500 that makes absolutely no sense.  Just do the math, every 15k per oil change I may get 5-7 oil changes in 5 years. That would be over $200 per oil change just to break even. Any one can see there is no value in that.  We said again that the warranty we were told we were buying would cover that.
We were told we weren't the only ones who had that happen.  And they had fired those people who were doing that.
Great life lesson I usually am that guy that reads everything before signing but being tired and a little too trusting just signed everything wanting to get home.
HOWEVER, if they fired people for what they were doing that still didn't fix what happened. Any one who purchased a vehicle that was handled by these people should have had there docs reviewed and offered refunds for warrantees that may have been misrepresented!!  
They said the fuel filter would be approx $300 and  differential fluids would cost $600.  When you read the maintenance schedule differential fluid only needs to be inspected and not changed at 30,000 miles. 
Also, the service dept is very unreliable.  We had dropped off our truck on a number of occasions and sometimes the work would be complete other times not.  
More recently we dropped this same truck off for a seat repair after previously being told should be covered under our leather seat protection.
We got the run around and somehow the seat wasn't there.  And later we were told the leather repair was NOT covered by our leather protection plan. Another warranty either misrepresented or they are simply trying to avoid covering the seat.   We had taken it in before and the seat was not repaired and left wires disconnected.  They didn't even check their work!!!

76,"December 17, 2016","Dodge owner BEWARE.  I purchased my 2016 Dodge Ram from this dealership in March of this year.  I noticed sometime after purchase that the right rear end would sag down when parked.  I have a busy schedule, so waited for months until I would be out of town for a 7-day vacation to get it warranty repaired.  I called the dealership 2 weeks prior to my departure to schedule an appointment and advised the service department of my issue.  They told me that since I could leave it with them for 7 days, no appointment would be necessary.  So, I dropped it off the day I left town.  On the day of my return (7 days later), I called my service advisor; Robert (Robbie) Karl to ensure my truck was ready for pickup.  He told me that he had tried to call me, but my phone number was incorrect in their system.  He further advised that the right rear airbag was in need of repair.  He said that he, and his service manager Doug, were not aware of any airbags that were installed by the factory and that they had held off repairs until confirming with me that I purchased the truck with airbags installed.  I told him the airbags came installed and that I purchased the truck from his dealership; look up the bill of sale.  He said, “Okay, I’ll call you back.”  He later returned my call to confirm the factory did install the airbags and that they needed more time to make the necessary repairs.  I asked, “Robbie, why did you wait 7 days to check the bill of sale?”  I cannot recall his exact answer, but it was something along the lines of they didn’t think of that.  Of course, now my truck was left in the same shape I gave it to them in…  They said they would give me a rental, but no rental place had an available truck or SUV; a requirement of my job to carry supplies.  They said they could not provide me a dealership loaner either.  Such incompetence.  Robbie should go into sales and get out of the service department, Doug obviously lacks the ability to think through anything.  What a waste.  This dealership steals your time and has no misgivings.  When I went to pickup my unrepaired truck, Robbie gave no solution; didn’t really care…  He had the nerve to say, “Let me know if I can help” as I walked to my truck.

81,"July 01, 2016","On the evening of Friday June 24, 2016, my family and I took a ride over to this dealership to check out Jeep Grand Cherokees.  (My current Jeep lease is coming to an end and we figured we start looking and see what our options are).  We walked in and no greeted us.  Okay, not a big deal.  I tell the front desk receptionist why I am there and they tell us to go to the lot and look at their inventory.  We go over to the lot and after 45 minutes of looking around no one comes outside.  My fiance was upset over the customer service and asked to talk to the sales manager.  We were put in contact with Todd who promised to help us out with a better experience so we went back and we were given Kyle as our salesman.  We were told ""he is our best"".  We pick out a Laredo and negotiate the payments/price for a new lease over the course of the weekend in person and via phone.  On Monday, we were told to come in for a 5pm appt.  At this point, the numbers were all agreed upon and we were there to sign the lease agreement and accept delivery of the SUV.  We did not get seen by Jimmy in Finance until 3 hours after our appt!  As we were walking in to the finance office, Kyle casually tells my fiance we are using US Trust Bank and tells us the contract is now different.  He does not explain why.  We sit down with Jimmy and tell him we were never told we were using this bank (a quick review online showed class action lawsuits as well as horrific reviews from prior lessees).  We told Jimmy we were never told that we were not using Chrysler.  At this point, Jimmy is confused.  I am livid- swear words and loud yelling came from me- I will admit. They waited 3 hours to tell us the deal was different!!  I ask Jimmy why would we use the other bank as we have no income or credit issues, etc.  He says he did not know.  Jimmy tells us he would go talk to someone and comes back and says he will honor the deal promised to us through Chrysler.  He re-reruns our credit- FYI- we never consented for them to run multiple inquiries on our credit as we did not know they were shopping with banks to pad their pockets the fattest they could.  He puts the contract in front of us- now with Chrysler and not the US Trust Bank they want and we notice a lot of things promised by Kyle missing off the contract.  For example, I paid extra for tire protection coverage on my previous lease and Kyle said it was now part of all their new leases.  We thought that was awesome.  We call Kyle into the room and he states that he never said that to us.  He literally sat there and pretended like he never had any of these prior conversations with us.  I brought up exact details about how I used the tire coverage within the last few months.  He says that he was referring to a manufacturer's rebate I must have gotten by purchasing new tires from them.  Now we have a new problem. - I still had paid a % out of pocket for the nail in my tires months ago because I thought they used my coverage that I had PAID for- nope!!! they never did- they only applied a manufacturers rebate- so now their service side is also a bunch of crooks!  Back to this scenario- a young guy walks into the room (I believe his dad may own the place by his demeanor- young spoiled brat).  He rips the contract off the table and tells us we will lease with the bank they choose or else we have no deal! They have now wasted 3 days of my life with their half truths and deceitfulness. Mind you, this is already after they had delivered the vehicle with the keys in my hand!  They were truly trying to strong arm us into a deal we were not comfortable with.  They said they no longer felt like they wanted to honor the deal with Chrysler and blamed it all on Todd who was not there this evening.  They said they do not have to disclose what bank they want to use- it is not up to the customer.  They said most consumers in Frisco don't ask what bank since people in Frisco have money.  They insulted the community of Frisco with these statements.  They basically admitted, because of where they are located, they can take advantage of people.  They said people in Frisco rarely read their contracts like we tried to do.  Scary guys! run!! this place is looking to pad their pockets with bad deals through in-reputable banks to get kick backs.  It was disgusting how they could all sit there and look us in the face knowing what they were doing and what they have done to other consumers.  They will take advantage of you!",1.0
82,"June 03, 2016","DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!

If you read my review, you'll see the salesman said it wasn't a hard inquiry when we were ready to finance, so not only did he lie to me about that, but they did FIVE hard inquires. Please please please don't waste your time here, they are not honorable people.

Long story short: they will mislead you as much as they can, and then get defensive when you call them out on it.

My fiancé and I were here on 2 separate occasions looking to buy a jeep Cherokee. We worked with a man named Adam who used the fact that he was new as an excuse for everything. (I understand what it means to be new and not know everything, if that's the case, then find someone who does know.)

First issue: online they are advertising a 2016 jeep Cherokee with $49 down and $299 a month for 84 months. Asked about this deal to several different people and none of them have any idea what it is or the terms/details.

Second issue: We got to the point where they offered financing and informed us that it wouldn't effect our credit, which was a lie. I can immediately see a hard inquiry on my credit report.

Story:
We came in and met Adam on Saturday, we left that day without deciding and told him we would come back. He was obviously disappointed that we didn't buy the car he showed us that was way out of our target price range, but we chalked it up to being tired and visited again today ready to try a couple more different models and purchase. We made an appointment and had to wait 10 minutes for him to come over. Then he helped us and it took another 20 minutes for him to bring us the car we wanted. (I understand that it takes awhile though, so we weren't frustrated at this point.) 

As we get in to take it for a test drive, he mentions needing to hurry this along so he can get to his other customers that are waiting there. He didn't seem irritated during the ride, but as soon as we got back he ran off and told us he'd be back in a minute. (While we waited, we explored the outside and saw a huge dent in the side.) After waiting for another 20-30 minutes, he hands us off to another gentleman. (We are still not irritated at this point.) We take the next salesman outside and show him the dent. His solution is that we bring it back and have them fix it rather than take some money off the price. (This means I have to drive out of my way on a day off and sit there for 1-2 hours while they fix it.) This wasn't a breaking point for us, so we continued with the process. 

They convinced us to try their credit vs using out outside source (which dinged our score even though they said it wouldn't.) While we do this, the second salesman goes off to form an offer for us. We finished the credit application and had to wait another 15-20 minutes until he finally came out. Then he goes over the paper, which is $2000 more than their price on the website because of the ""Frisco protection plan"" ($1000) they put on all their vehicles. I think it's great, and worth the price, but it's very misleading to put a price on their website that isn't the actual price. (I even mentioned this price to them and they didn't say anything about the extra protection plan.) The other $1000 is a rebate they don't give you if you finance through someone else. My fiancé tells him we want $2000 more off the price of the car not including taxes. He gets an attitude with us and says ""You want me to take $7000 grand off MSRP?!"" And I said ""I want you to honor the price on your website.""

We inform him that the price isn't where we want to be, and tell him where we need to be. He gets defensive and slightly unprofessional with us. (I'm ready to leave at this point because I will not be treated by someone that way when I'm about to give them a sale. My fiancé convinces me to stay and see what they come back with.) 10 more minutes of waiting and he comes back with the down payment we want, but $80 extra a month on the payment. He also claims that my outside source APR is way above what I was told it was and that this is the best deal they can do. I show him my pre-qualification letter on my phone and he asks to take it back to his manager again. At first I agreed, but at this point I was very tired and sick of waiting around, so I told him no thank you and that I wanted to leave. He wanted to try and talk to his manager again so he left. I asked my fiancé for the keys so I could go lay down in our car.",1.0

85,"March 17, 2016","Buying a used car for my son here was a nightmare!  Called on a car that I saw on their website on a Tuesday and was directed to sales associate (James).  Informed him that I was paying cash and wanted to know his best price.  He told me that the best price was as listed and to come in and he 'would see what he could do'.  He was very unprofessional and spoke with a lot of sales talk and using a lot of 'slang' loves the term ""amen"".  ""You're getting a great car, say amen"".  I found it both irritating, insulting, and unprofessional.  I get a call the next morning from Todd who claimed to be the sales manager and that he was making deals and selling cars today.  I told him great, give me the best price on the Challenger and I would be in to pick it up.  He said that he was going to run the numbers and call me back in 15 minutes.  He never called me back.  I called him multiple times and finally got a hold of him and he said that another sales associate would call.  I got the call from this associate and he stated that the best price was the price listed.  I voiced to this poor guy my unhappiness and we ended the call.  Next afternoon (Thursday) I get a call from James and he wants to sell me the car and deal.  My son and I were going that way so we stopped by and my son fell in love with the car.  After some negotiating, we agreed on a price and they sure did not like the fact that I was paying cash for the car.  We were supposed to pick it up the next day on Friday at 3pm when I supplied them with a cashiers check.  We get there, the car had not been touched as the water bottle from the test drive was still in the car.  The few scratches that they agreed to buff was not done and not a stitch of paperwork was ready for a 'CASH' sale with an appointment.  Then they had my son the key and I say where is the other key.  James says there is not one and it is 'as is'.  The car is a 2015 challenger with 17K miles!  I ask them to get me another key and they say, 'NO'.  I told them that this is unacceptable and if my kid wasn't there that I would walk away from the sale.  James told me, ""fine they don't want to sell you a car anyway"".  ""They don't want to sell to an 'unhappy' customer"".  I told them to get the paperwork and my car right now before I call my attorney.  End of the day, not a manager came to me and nobody at this dealership would do the right thing.  I think they were trying to get me to back out so they could sale the car to somebody that would finance it.  Terrible experience with a horrible dealership!    ",1.4
86,"March 03, 2016","Stopped by here after work to look at cars. Shawn Swenson greeted me and advised me to talk to his guys and let them ""take care"" of me. 
Trying to do my own figures and estimates I had pretty much decided that I should consider something like the low end dodge. 
Spoke with sales manager Todd who referred me to Jon. Apparently I was cheating myself because I have more options with different models including Chrysler models for the same budget- but still with low mileage and warranty. They even explained ways to compare years, rebates, and gently used car values to get what I would really want instead of what I had already assumed I would be stuck with.  
Sometimes it feels awkward to be a woman that doesn't know stuff about the car buying process.  But it was nice to get so much information without anyone pressuring or badgering me.  
I never signed any paperwork, they knew I was curious and only browsing, but still spent a lot of time with me.  Nobody shunned me over the fact that they weren't even making any money off me (yet). 
I felt very comfortable and learned a lot to keep in mind. I will for sure be back for my new Chrysler. ",5.0
87,"February 16, 2016",Where do I begin!  I purchased my used vehicle last year from Frisco Dodge.  From the time I purchased my car I had to bring it in for service several times within the first 3 months for the same issue.  I continued to have issues with it for about 9 months.  Thank goodness I purchased the extended warranty!  Once they have your money it’s like pulling teeth to get any help from them one you have an ongoing problem after you purchase.  If you take your car in for service watch them- they like to be sneaky and try to tell you that you need to pay for something you don’t.  On several occasions the service department has told me I needed to have something done that was going to cost $100+.  The first time I declined what they wanted me to do and took it to my reasonable mechanic in Frisco to see what his cost was going to be.  He told me that I did not even need to have that repair done.  The 2nd time I took my car in for service (this was a follow-up to an ongoing issue) they told me one of the parts was going to be covered by my extended warranty but not the other nor the labor and it was going to cost me $150 to repair the other part on top of the deductible.  I told my boyfriend about it who then talked to his dad who used to work on cars.  He told us that the part that need to be repaired (the part the dealership would not cover) would have to be accessed to get to the part that was covered and I should not have to pay for the labor if they already had to get to the covered part.  Of course the labor was the most expensive part of this job.  I called the service guy back and told him only to repair what was covered by the warranty and that I would take the car to my mechanic for the other to have repaired.  I got a phone call back shortly thereafter telling me they would do me the courtesy of covering the entire repair so I did not have to make another trip.  I truly believe it’s only because they knew my mechanic would tell me what I already knew.  To top it off I just recently made an appointment to get my oil changed there. I got there at my appointment time (9:45 am) and they told me that it would be  over a two hours wait.  I asked why when I already had an appointment.  They told me they had walk ins come in ahead of me and that pushed me out to wait longer.  I asked the guy what the point of having an appointment was if walk in could come in and push me out?  All he said was “do you want to wait two hours – I don’t want to start the paperwork if you don’t want to wait.”   I’m supposed to get free oil changes with the purchase of my car but sometimes it’s just not worth dealing with them.  I wish there was a closer dodge dealership to work with.,1.4
88,"January 30, 2016","Learn from my mistakes in dealing with this dealership. The internet price is not what you will see when you show up.

I had to call MOPAR to get the actual value of the warranty, and I cancelled it as soon as I found out what it really covered.  What I was told the warranty covered and the actual coverage were two different things.  Don't wait for the warranty paperwork to come in the mail.

I came across one at Frisco CDJR for a reasonable price. I called and spoke to Maxx very helpful and honest. He mentioned its a popular car and I should come quick. I finally convinced my wife to go with me and look at it. Mind you we arrived late almost 8pm and they closed at 9pm. I spoke with Anthony he was helpful as well. between him and Maxx they stayed late to help us out. The car hadn't been thru an inspection yet so I wasn't able to take the vehicle home. I waited 4 days for the car to have tires and a couple things put on to pass state inspection. after 4 days I was excited to get my NEW car. In the process my wife and I got car fever and she decided she wanted one also. So having said that, the dealership was going to sell 2 vehicles to us. We made an appt to go back  a week later and purchase a car for my wife. At this time my vehicle had some problems. It quit running and was inoperable. My wife is 8 months pregnant and they knew that so they was looking for a good SUV for her. I called and spoke to the finance guy because that's the only person that would call me back. ""First problem"" he told me that he was able to help and that he wouldn't mind. In the mean time he was talking about the other car we was going to buy. I thought that's great I can drop my car off have it fixed and get the new one. I called back same day and he was no longer working there. I got transferred to a different guy who said ill get you over to the service dept. ""Second problem"" he didn't call me back as well. I text my salesman who had a service advisor ""Robby"" call me. I explained all the problems he replied with let me ask the service manager and see what we can do. He called back within a reasonable amount of time and said that there was nothing he could do. it was sold ""AS IS"" I understood that but, it had only been 7 days and we was going to purchase another vehicle so I thought they wouldn't mind helping me and taking care of the customer. Long story short they didn't want to help and come to find out the part for my vehicle was only $104.26 so after them not wanting to help me out I WILL NOT be going back to purchase my wife's vehicle.

My total amount financed, interest rate and extended warranty. I repeatedly asked for this but he could not give me that info until I talked with the ""business"" guy. At 3:30 I was told to rush and get my wife and 3 sons so she could sign the paperwork. We returned to the dealership at 3:50. We then sat in the waiting area with 3 young boys until 6:00 to get to the paperwork. Once we entered the office he started entering our information that he had since roughly 3:50. Then the numbers were a little off because he still couldn't tell me the ""complete deal"". Once the numbers didn't match I laid keys on table to walk out. The finance director with a broken arm barges in and starts talking over eveyone. Says we will make it work. When we look at bottom number they told me they  reduced the price of vehicle $745. But all the did was take off the conditioning fee. This was money they spent to get car ready. Yet online it says final price (that was not included).

1 hour and 30 minutes later, I was tied of sitting the lobby.  I got up to go use the bathroom and saw my car sitting in the lane as if it was done.  I figured I would give them some time as the car may have just came out of service.

10 minutes later, no one had come to hand me my keys or ask for payment.  I decided to look in the Jeep to see if the Oil Change had been done, and behold it had been.  My advisor walked past me as I walked toward him and mumbled something.  I thought he said he was waiting on another advisor.  I guess I was wrong, because 10 more minutes past. 

Getting more and more upset, I went to another advisor.  He told me he would have to find my advisor and then promptly walked in another direction.

My advisor came out another 10 minutes later with my paper work.  As he is showing me the cost, I questioned him on why the price did not match the coupon I showed him 2 hours before.  He looked confused and walked away, leaving me to stand uncomfortably by the cashiers another 5 minutes.

He then came back to explain that he can't lower the price below $37.95.  He has already taken out all the labor and can't reduce the amount without General Manager approval.  At this point I am beyond pissed and need to leave before I make a scene.  I tell him that I will just pay it so I can get out of there.

We'd bought the truck less than a month prior at Roger Williams Dodge in Weatherford (never, EVER buy from them) and they'd apparently done a band-aid fix to a big transmission issue. It was completely burned out when Frisco Dodge looked at it and they replaced the entire thing under warranty. Not only that, but they got it done fours day earlier than expected!

111,"May 23, 2015","I took my Wrangler in because I noticed fluid leaking from under the dash on the passenger's side.  After a quick chat with the service technician, he agreed that he thought the heater core had a leak.  As he took notes on the issue, I informed the technician that I had an extended warranty.  He made copies of the card and assured me that they dealt with extended warranties often.  The next day I dropped my Wrangler off for service (I would have left it the prior evening, but all the rental car locations were closed).  I was told it would be ready in approximately 24 hours.  Nearly 96 hours later, I received a call from the dealership; however, I was in a meeting and unable to answer the phone.  No voicemail was left.  When I called the dealership back later, I was unable to speak with anyone who had any knowledge of the situation.  I called three times and received the same general message.  At one point I was even told to call back in 10 to 15 minutes because they were too busy to talk to me.  After I got off work, I drove to the dealership to check on the status of my vehicle.  I was told that the heater core was indeed leaking, along with a few other issues that they found.  I authorized them to fix all that they found wrong.
I was told it would take 48 hours to complete the repairs. I called the dealership 48 hours later to check only to get no answer (literally, no one would pick up the phone).  Once again, I drove the the dealership to check on status of the vehicle and was told it would be ready the next day because the service tech broke some clips that had to be ordered.  24 hours later I called to see if it was ready only to have no one answer the phone.  Driving to the dealership a third time, my vehicle was finally finished. 
When I went to pay and I brought up the warranty, the technician that I had been dealing with the entire time told me that this was the first he had heard of a warranty.  I reminded him that he made copies of the card on my very first visit.  I spoke to the service department manager and was basically accused of lying about the warranty.  I was told that it was his tech's word against mine and I would have to take it up with my extended warranty company.  (So much for the good ol' days of the customer always being right...)
The only reason I am giving them two stars rather than one is because they were willing to pay for my rental car.  What started as a one day rental turned into eight.  And yes, I had to call the company each day to extend my rental for another 24 hours.  ",2.0

I arrived around 3:30 I could see my Jeep sitting in a bay. I told the service people I was here to pick it up. They said it would be out here soon. I stood out side and watch them move my jeep out of one bay and into another. When I went inside again and asked about my vehicle they said couldn't find my file, they suggested it was over where the payments are made. The girl there told me they were just topping  off  the fluids.I informed her that I dropped the Jeep off at 08:30 this morning and asked her why it was taking so long. She went and got another service guy, he told me they hadn't done the old change yet. I asked if I could speak with the service manager, he came out with my file and brought me into his office. I asked him if he could tell me why my vehicle had been there all day and hadn't been serviced. He said he didn't know. I asked what he was going to do about it? I reminded him my car had beed there all day. He replied ""Obviously I can't pay you for your time."" He suggested I wait and the oil change would be free. I again told him that my Jeep had been there all day and I had things to do. I told him to just bring my car out so I could leave.

114,"May 15, 2015","I purchased my Ram 1500 in 2013 when the dealership was still owned by Patt Lobb. The purchase was the smoothest and best new car experience I have ever had. The sales person, Bill Mitchell, was a helpful and no pressure sales person that helped me find the exact vehicle I wanted/needed. Not long after the purchase, the dealership changed ownership, and things have not been the same. On 3/16/15, I purchased 2 new front tires. When I returned to the dealership on 5/7/15 to have my 30K mile service completed, I was advised that I need to replace all 4 tires. The 2 front tires only had 5,918 on them and were less than 2 months old, so I declined to replace the tires at that time.  2 hours after leaving the dealership, I called and left a voicemail for the Service Manager to call me about the concerns I had regarding that interaction. After 8 days and no call from the Service Manager, I called back. Once the receptionist heard my complaints, she said she would have the General Manager call me back, instead of the Service Manager.  I received a call back 2 hours later, but it was the Service Manager instead of the General Manager. I asked if he had received my call 8 days ago to which he replied that he had not, but he did have a couple ""staticky"" messages that he wasn't able to understand, and therefore he couldn't return those calls. I can't believe this is the best excuse he could come up with.  After telling him about my concern with the tires and the overall negative perception I have about the ethics and quality of service from the dealership, he informed me that the service advisor who asvised me to buy 4 tires had been fired, so unfortunately he couldn't be quesrioned about that interaction. He said they had received other customer complaints so the guy was fired. This was the end of the conversation as far as he was concerned, but showed me zero customer service or sense of urgency to meet or exceed the customer's expectations. After getting nothing from this conversation, I called back and left a voicemail for the General Manager to return my call, which I am still waiting for. In addition to this lack of response, I completed the survey I received after my service was completed.

120,"March 14, 2015","I really have LOTS to say but if you read the other low star count reviews you'll get most of what I was going to say. 
I have a Jeep Wrangler I purchased new in Corinth a few years ago. When I purchased it, Classic had the Factory Warranty extended from 3/36,000 to 7/75,000 because they saw I wasn't completely sold on the ""new"" wrangler's mechanical soundness. (FYI, I now believe. 3 yrs old and nothing but normal preventative maintenance). 
Back to FCDJR: I live less than 5 miles from this dealership and after one (1) visit to their Service Dept. I will be driving to Plano or even back to Corinth for service EVEN Warranty Service. 
I normally wouldn't recommend complete avoidance of a business after only one negative experience. (everyone has a bad day now and again). HOWEVER, Every interaction with FCDJR over those 6 days my Jeep was with them was as needlessly negative as  any interaction between myself and a business could be. The only person at this business that didn't project a distaste for me interrupting their day was the Porter they had drive me home when the ""courtesy van"" was not available. (I think they run the ""courtesy"" van for about an hour a day because it's NEVER available.) Oh yeah, by the way...  the Porter didn't say much during the ride because I only speak English and he didn't seem comfortable with that language.  
It is VERY unfortunate that ""The Greenway Auto Group of Orlando Florida"" has decided to buy Texas Dealerships AND that Pat Lobb decided to sell this one so soon after opening it. Hopefully word will spread fast and FCDJR will close allowing ANY OTHER business to make use of that land. ",1.5
121,"February 28, 2015","My Daughter found a 2007 KIA Sorento she liked so I drove 45 minutes to check it out and make the deal for her. After looking at the car, test driving the car, it was time to talk numbers. I offered the salesman $6500.00 plus tax,title, and license. He went to the office and back came someone other than the salesman we had been dealing with. He said could I go another $100.00 because the used car manager would not take $6500.00, I said yes. So he say's $6600.00 plus tax, title, and license, I said yes we have a deal. So the original salesman comes back and my Daughter  does all the paperwork. He makes a copy of her drivers license and then brings in the final sheet showing the price of the car, $6600.00, the amount of the license fee, and the amount of the taxes. Also on this sheet was another fee for $125.00. I said that we did not agree to this $125.00 document fee. He then takes the sheet back to the used car managers office, and the second guy comes back into the office. He proceeds to tell me everyone pays that fee.  I proceed to tell him that we did not agree to that fee, we agreed to $6600.00 plus tax,title,and license. He said that everyone pays that fee and if I did not agree to pay that then we did not have a deal. I said to him that was not part of our deal and that I would not pay it. he then tells me and my Daughter to leave his Dealership. As I walked onto the sales floor, I said I wanted to speak tp the General Manager. He pointed to a glass walled office and said there he is. The Operations Manager, as that is what it said on the window, had two men in his office so I waited for him to finish with those two men. As I was waiting a man came out of the next office and said he was the used car director. He proceeded to tell me that everyone pays that fee. I explained to him that we agreed to $6600.00 plus tax, title, and license. Our deal did not include a $125.00 document fee. He then said the deal was off. Now, the operations Manager sat there looking and hearing  all of this taking place and never came  out to see if he could do anything. The door to the operations Managers office, if it had one, was open and we were standing less than five feet from the door. He finally did come out and told the used car manager to get me out of the dealership. I never used any proffanity nor did I call anyone any names, other than the fact that they lied to me. When we got outside the used car manager told me I could pay the fee or he was not going to honor the agreement that we had made. This is a dealership with no integrity. I did not make the mistake of not telling about the $125.00 fee, they did, and still would not honor the agreement. I found it very insulting that the Operations manager did nothing about the situation other than to tell the used car manager to get me out of the dealership.

2) They did not disclose missing 2nd key. When I took the possession, I asked where is the second key. The answers was ""you can get it make from any place"". I think they should have offered me 2nd key.

146,"August 01, 2014","I recently purchased a 2014 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited at Frisco CDJR, and I must say that I was thoroughly impressed, specifically with the level of customer service, professionalism, candidness, and selection of inventory.  I worked with Bill Mitchell and Larry Parks during the sales and selection process, and both were very sensitive to my wants and needs as a customer, and at a price that was reasonable for me.  Abraham Cisneros worked with me through the finance portion, and everything went smoothly during that process, and he was very low pressure when it came to all of the extra coverages (which I did end up purchasing GAP, the wheel/tire/windshield/PDR, and lifetime warranty).  I will be recommending Frisco CDJR and to my friends and family for all of their Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, and Ram needs.",5.0

Before you go anywhere else do yourself a favor and go to this location first.  No worries after the purchase, they followed up and confirm my purchase exceeded expectations, which it has. 

The quality in these 2014 jeeps and cars have gone up while I've noticed other luxury brands seemed have gone down.   Check them out you won't be disappointed!

I now have a great vehicle that I love thanks to a very attentive salesman, Tim really made me feel comfortable and wasn't trying to push me in one direction or another. He wanted me to get what i wanted and at a price I could afford and he made sure that happened. I could not have asked for a better experience and I can't wait to recommend this dealership to others!

153,"June 09, 2014","I haven't purchased a domestic vehicle for 20+ years and I have become accustom to to a very professional car buying experience and negotiation process.  For multiple reasons, I decided to buy a Dodge product which I am thoroughly pleased with having had it for several months now; however, it was the worst car buying experience I have ever had.

I knew the selection of vehicles in the area and was calling dealerships to see who would accept my offer on ones they had in stock.  After speaking with the salesman, he said he'd have to ask his manager and would let me know if they would take the deal.  He called back 30 minutes later telling me to come get the car that they would take the deal.  It was anything but that easy.  I knew I was in trouble when after completing a large portion of the paperwork the salesman said he would be back with the best deal he could get me.  They came back $2,000 over what they had agreed to accept and the sales manager tried to say there was a ""misunderstanding"" and blame it on the salesman.  This was a position that was difficult to support given the paper with the exact amount was still on the salesman's desk where he wrote it down during the phone call.

After walking out twice, they eventually sold me the vehicle at the agreed upon price; however, the damage was done.  There was no satisfaction or enjoyment with acquiring a new vehicle and this was an experience so foreign to me having had such straight forward, professional negotiations with the last several foreign vehicles.

When I picked up the vehicle the next day, the salesman came up to me and said, ""I just want you to know that the deal was always there, they just wanted you to work for it.""

I do have to say that after the sale, there were some issues with the vehicle and they went out of there way to resolve the issues.

154,"May 25, 2014","Can't trust these guys.  Been working with them for a couple of days on a used vehicle.  Left Friday afternoon without reaching an agreement on a price.  Called back an hour later and made another offer which they accepted.  Told them if they would send me the total cost and purchase agreement I would be in the following morning a little before noon with a cashiers check.  They said that would be fine and sent the agreement about 7pm which I confirmed getting and reiterated I would be there a little before noon.  Sales person leaves me a VM at 11AM the next morning and I call him back at 11:15am.  He says he's getting some heat for holding the keys and needs a credit card to put a deposit down on the vehicle so he can hold it (first time anyone has mentioned the need for a deposit).  I give him the cc info and confirm we are going to get the check and will  be there before noon.  He calls back 10 mind later (while I'm in route) to tell me the car has already been sold.  I get to the dealership and speak with the manager who basically tells me to go plow water.  They admitted they should have asked for a deposit the previous evening over the phone but feel they did nothing else wrong.  Needless to say it got a little heated before being asked to leave.  Apparently, they didn't feel it was a conversation potential customers would be interested in.  Bottom line is they found someone that morning who was willing to pay more for the vehicle and they decided the money meant more than their verbal commitment to me.  Do yourself a favor and take your business to someone who actually stands behind their word.",1.0
155,"May 20, 2014","I brought my 2003 Dodge Stratus RT in for service. I was told by service adviser that the charge to diagnose my problem would be ""$216 Up front but that if I chose to have repairs done this amount would be applied to the cost of the repair"". The problem was diagnosed as ""you need a new engine"". I asked about the cost of replacing the engine and was quoted $7000 for a new engine so I inquired about the possibility of putting a used engine in the car. I was quoted $4500. I declined to have the repairs done because of the cost to repair exceeding the value of the car. I then told the service adviser that I or my son would be by to get the car and was told the car was not drive able and was not ""put back together"" then asked if I would like to have a wrecker arranged. I explained that I drove the car in and expected to be able to drive it out; that the car needed to be put back together. When I asked what my final total charge would be for the diagnostics I was told ""$369, how's that sound?"" I stated that I was told the amount to diagnose my car was going to be $216 but the adviser stated that ""you had a couple of rusty bolts that needed to be replaced because they broke when we took the car apart"". I was told that my car would be ready by the next day which was Saturday, however, on Saturday I was called and told that it would not be ready until Monday. Monday morning I went to the dealer to pay for my car and was presented a bill for $469. I told the service adviser that that was not the amount he had told me but that he had told me it would be about $360. The adviser did adjust my bill to the $360 amount but I left the dealership feeling totally frustrated. 
Needless to say, I will not be using this dealership for any future repairs or recommending this dealership to my friends or family (or anyone else that for that matter. I would not feel comfortable buying a car from this dealership nor will I consider them in the future. ",2.3

158,"April 21, 2014","Prior to heading to the dealership, I called Tim and let him know that I would be coming and what I would be looking for. When I arrived at the dealership, he already had a vehicle that matched my specifications sitting out front, ready for me to look at and drive. I immediately appreciated the fact that he had a vehicle writer for me that was exactly to my specifications, down to the options I wanted and the color I desired. Up to this point, Tim did not know that I would be purchasing this vehicle at Chrysler employee pricing. You see, vehicles purchased from dealers at employee pricing do not yield the dealership nor the salesman much of any profit. Tim and I talked after I test drove the car and I also spent a lot of time on I'm a lot looking at other like cars with different options. When I revealed to Tim that I would be purchasing the vehicle at the employee pricing level, his demeanor never changed. As I said, vehicles purchased an employee pricing do not provide the sales person with much of any commission. However, Tim was the consummate professional and even after I revealed employee pricing, he treated me with courtesy, respect, and showed extreme patience with me while I probably mulled for at least 45 minutes over three vehicles I was considering. When I finally made my decision, Tim retrieved the vehicle from the back of a lot, brought it to me, and we both drove around just a bit in it together so I could confirm that this was the Jeep Cherokee for me. Tim had finance rolling right away, and I was in and out of the dealership in about two and a half hours. It was rainy that day, so Tim arrange for me to bring the car back in this past Saturday for the new car detailing and the installation of my navigation. I also want to hand out kudos to Abe in the finance department, and Cody in the service department, as my experience with both departments was stellar. I cannot say enough good things about Tim. He even texted me over the weekend to make sure everything went well with the navigation installation and detailing, and called me again today to check and see if I was completely satisfied with the vehicle.

There was never any pressure and the entire process was as easy as going to Super Target to buy groceries.

164,"January 15, 2014","After being pressured by a salesman at another dealership, I had almost decided to wait on buying a new Jeep.  However, I filled out an online request for info on a Jeep on Pat Lobb's lot that I liked.  Salesman Larry Laper called me quickly after I submitted my request, let me know that the Jeep was still available, and knowledgably answered questions I had.  After speaking with Larry, per his recommendation, I filled out the online application finance form.  I had a question about the banking information page on the form, and Jurel Scott called me quickly and handled the issue.  I made an appointment for that evening, and Larry was there upon arrival.  We quickly went from the lobby to the Jeep so I could take a look, then were in it for a test drive without having to wait.  After test driving and Larry showing us the price breakdown on the Jeep, I decided to buy.  The entire process was a breeze.  At no time did I feel pressured or uncomfortable, but rather, I felt in control of the situation - which has not been the norm in my past car buying experiences.  After deciding to buy, my husband and I met with Don Lepard in the finance department.  He clearly and effectively explained all of the details on our credit and finance paperwork.  He didn't pressure us into buying any additional warranties, but rather knowledgably explained and recommended additional coverage he thought might be beneficial.  This is the first time I have felt completely good about buying a new car.  Because there was no pressure, I didn't leave questioning if I had made a mistake.  I left a couple of hours after my test drive, feeling good about my new purchase, and completely in love with my new Jeep, that the dealership washed and gassed up for me before I drove off the lot with it that night.

I gave him my name and phone number and he said he'd call when he got a set. Well the practical part of me though I'll never hear back, because dealers don't want to mess with this kind of stuff!

Just before Christmas Josh called, and said he had a set and I was first on his list if I still wanted them, I said I'll be there in 30 minutes. I told Josh the jeep I wanted to put them on was at my ranch and would not be back home in Frisco until deer season was over. He told me ""No problem,  I'll put your name on them till you get here"". 

Mr. Mathews, This is Exceptional Customer Service, and followed through, because he owned it!!!!  I also want to acknowledge Eddie Rivera, for the time he spent visiting with me in the lobby, In addition Cory Pasztor, and the tire shop guys did a outstanding job in cold wet and miserable weather conditions.

We were very specific on the type of vehicle and budget we planned to stay within, and he provided with exactly what we were looking for.

Second, was Don Lepard, who was very professional and extremely helpful when it came to finalizing the paper work.  Don’s overall knowledge with the financing side of the car sale helped us greatly in choosing the car warranty options we felt were best for us.

We greatly enjoyed our experience at Pat Lobb’s Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, and Ram with both Rubin and Don.  I have already recommend to others at my place of employment that when they start to look for a vehicle that they should first consider Pat Lobb’s Chrysler, dodge, Jeep, Ram.

After I looked online for what I wanted I contacted them on their cell phones and both were very open to answering any questions my wife or I had regardless of time or how big or small the question was.

They looked at my trade, gave me a fair offer that I asked for and the deal was done.  John in finance was very informative and although I declined the additional coverages and options, they are definately worth considering if they fit a need.
