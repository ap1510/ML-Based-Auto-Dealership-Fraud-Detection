1,"April 07, 2018","I purchased a pre-owned truck.   A lot of things happened right after we bought the truck and I was upset and ready to go to battle.    I called the General Manager John, on a Saturday…. He called me back right after I left a message saying he wanted to reach out and see how he could help.  I was still leery and ready to fight… I couldn’t.   He really, truly, actually listened to what I was concerned about and made it right.  He was very reasonable and…  I mean - he made it right.  I felt like it was just things went wrong, not that the dealership was trying to pull one over on me… because at the end of the day, they really did take care of me and make it right.",4.0
