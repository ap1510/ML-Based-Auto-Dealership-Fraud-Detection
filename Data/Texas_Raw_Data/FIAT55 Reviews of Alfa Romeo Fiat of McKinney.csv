Have called them several times most the time they don't know what I'm talking about. They say oh I'm sorry we didn't know you haven't received anything yet from us, we will send it by next week!"" Still to this day haven't received anything at all! We have been buying paper tags EVERY MONTH since we got this car! It's ridiculous! Not only that, we find out they are in trouble over screwing people over or going bankrupt. And the guy that financed the car to us is no longer working there! They wouldn't even tell us why? ",1.0
1,"June 27, 2019",I paid in full for a vehicle over 3 months ago. They took 6 weeks to deliver the vehicle and still have not released the paper work to prove I have ownership of the vehicle. Everyone there is full of excuses and no action. Take your business elsewhere,1.4
2,"June 20, 2019","Tire sensor problem took two months of two and three times a week repair before it was fixed  They dented front passenger side finder and claimed it wasn't their fault.
They do sloppy half way repair. Most of their employees are gone.",1.2
3,"June 15, 2019","Under no circumstances should you use this dealership for anything. They have had our car for over a week and although it was leaking large amounts of oil (after their sister dealership repaired the valve cover gasket- leading to the oil leak) and still haven’t fixed it. Finally sent an email asking if they’ve given up on my car and if so should I come and pick it up and the reply was— yes, I should pick it up.  It’s dumbfounding to me that the service department at a Fiat car dealership is unable to fix a Fiat.  😂😂 

I’m providing a one star because it requires something, but I’d give them no stars no because even putting one star implies they are remotely competent and they don’t even deserve implying they are anything close to competent.

4,"June 03, 2019","On February 4th my husband and I went to the Alfa Romeo
of Dallas to start looking at cars (my lease was coming to an
end in the fall). After looking and speaking with the sales
team and general manager we decided to go ahead with a
new lease once we negotiated in a pay off agreement for the
current lease vehicle. Details were agreed to and signed off
on. Then at the begining of April we begin recieving notices
of failure to pay the previous leased vehicle (through Toyota
Financial). Come to find out the automotive group behind
Alfa Romeo Dallas (KamKad) had failed to pay the previous
lease off. We contacted them immediately to get resolution
the week of April 8th. We were told they were behind
payments but would get it resolved within 30 days. We
believed them. 30 days come and go and still nothing.
Toyota is now threatening collections and inevitable credit
damage. Still nothing from Alfa. My husband gets an
attorney friend involved; still nothing. Last week, the week
of June 25th, the general manager said he would provide us
with our initial paper work. That never arrived. Today, my
husband was told that our original car was likely sold at
auction without title work, and that there was nothing we
could do. We are increasingly alarmed as they continue
scamming people, and as the automotive group continues to
build its portfolio buying a new dealership. BEWARE.",1.0
5,"June 01, 2019","Bought  an Abarth 500 March 29th. Dealership took 10 after signed contract to deliver the car with only one key. Salesman said the dealership had auditors going through it and couldn’t release the car sooner but he would order a key. Over 2 months later with expired temp tags,  no real tags, title, extended warranty papers or key and after numerous texts and emails to the point of threat of bringing in Tx agencies, the GM (Darrell) emails me to tell me the dealership is being sold (and is insolvent). They currently have no money to pay for my tags and taxes or my extended warranty (totals a little over $3000) that I already paid for when I purchased car. Darrell says they’ll have money in 3 weeks when the dealership sells but I really question it. I was foolish by a good price and didn’t look at dealer reviews. The car is fantastic btw and takes away the negative dealership experience.

I hope I can have an update in July that says things worked out but if the last 2 years of reviews are an indication, I can only hope.

Based on previous complaints from others, Darrell will respond with an apology and attempt to explain, then says something to work to resolve. I will post an update if any positive outcome occurs so if you don’t see an update, issues haven’t been resolved. ",1.8
6,"May 31, 2019","I bought a used 2018 Kia Sportage from Alfa Romeo Fiat Mckinney on March 1. I had seen this car online in Nov. and contacted them saying it was more than I could spend, to let me know if the price came down. Price came down, a few thousand dollars but I did not hear from anyone there. I found it again online. I still liked the car, had not bought anything else, so I bought it. I made 2 trips from south Oak Cliff to McKinney, 37 miles each way.

My temporary plates expired on 4/30. I had contacted my salesman after about 4 weeks after buying the car, he said I'd receive them soon. Still not here. Could get ticketed. Texted my salesman again, didn't know who I was because he had a new phone. Identified myself and why I needed help. He said he no longer worked there. I started calling the dealership about 3 weeks ago, never could reach a human being, left messages in sales and customer service. No call backs. Finally called the operator last week. She said the dealership was being refinanced and they were way behind processing things like that. I said that was unacceptable, I had paid them to take care of it. She said I could go to the tax office myself, I said I did not want to do that.

I posted to Yelp and Cars.com and received a boilerplate statement of concern with the same phone number and an email address. Have emailed several times, no reply. 

I did finally go to the tax office. The car has not even been registered! I had to pay $33.75 to get a temporary plate for 30 days!

I also got a direct number for the general manager at ARF. I have started leaving messages, and hope tomato his life miserable until this is taken care of. Still no rep[iles. I will also keep posting everywhere I can think of.

Not my problem but my salesman has left the dealership because of their problems and was never paid his commission for selling me the car.

7,"May 29, 2019","I'm having the same problem as everyone else. I purchased a used vehicle on March 14th ,2019. Never did receive my plates. I paid an extra 500$ into my total to cover my TT&L.  I've called,E-mailed and nothing. Finally had enough,and drove down there from Oklahoma.  I walked in to find only two people working. They said they were there ""To take over and clean up the mess the other people left."" I gave them the benefit of the doubt.  Well they try to tell me that I could just print off temp tags through my E-mail. Well yeah sure if you want to go to jail.  I asked the DMV about it,and they said No! They asked for their phone number so they could tell them that was illegal,but did the answer NOPE! We filed a complaint with the tag office about not receiving our plate's or title,so its on going Process . Just paid 30$ for a temp tag that they promised they would provide me with since it was their fault.  ALL BULLCRAP!! Good job for hiring more CROOKED PEOPLE!

8,"May 29, 2019",Month 4 and I still haven't received my registration. I have my own plates and even then they are not able to get this done! So far I've been paying for two car payments because my trade in was not paid off! 4 months of double car payments! It's unacceptable. ,1.6

11,"April 29, 2019","I have been tryin to get my wheel bearings replaced on my wife's 500L for over a week now. Last Monday I had an 8AM appointment to have them check out the car.  First off the service area door wasn't even unlocked until 8:30. Second, it took until 11;30 for them to come tell me that yes I was right, the wheel bearings are bad.  Was told they could not fix it that day, did not have the parts. Here I am a week later, 9AM appointment and they can't start on it until 10:30? Then I was  told it will take over 2 hours to do the repairs. Still sitting in the repair waiting room as I write this review.  Best advice to anyone thinking of coming here for anything: RUN AWAY, as far and fast as you can.  NEVER again will I deal with this location.",1.0
12,"April 19, 2019",Do not buy from Alfa Romeo Fiat of McKinney or Dallas. They are the stereotypical car dealer who gives other decent dealers a bad name. They are literally stealing money from me so watch out you decide to give them a chance. You just may regret it. Actually retained an attorney this morning. Fun fun. ,1.8
13,"April 03, 2019","I purchased a truck from them on January 3rd 2019, as of today my truck hasn’t been registered as required by texas law. Derrell Cresswell the GM told me that they don’t own the truck they sold me, and they are trying to pay for the truck and get the title. I traded in a truck that had a clear title which they have since sold. The owner Kenneth Lee Strickler Jr. Lied to my finance company and told them I refused to bring the truck in for a state inspection. 

Derrell has told me that the Kenneth is the owner and is the only one that signs checks to pay for the truck they sold me.

My finance company and I have offered to swap collateral for a truck that they own. I was told they will do that when they can afford to make the swap, I was told the don’t have money to pay off my truck or to sell me the other truck.

Kenneth Strickler will not return phone calls or answer his phone.

14,"April 03, 2019","BY FAR THE WORST DEALERSHIP IN THE WORLD, including ALFA ROMEO DALLAS by Love Field which is owned by the same group, which according to some well informed sources had the titles of all the cars in its lot pulled by Alfa Romeo a few days ago. It all starts from the GM Darrell Creswell which is a deceptive, dishonest, Teflon-faced liar, on to the Finance Dept. which has the only goal of screwing you blind by fudging the numbers and simply put in practice the lies that the GM and the sales staff has told you if you were so unlucky to actually accept a deal from them, moving on to the sales staff which is borderline pathetic (especially Frank Ivens, as sleazy, slimy and slippery as they come) and act like you are bothering them when you enter the 70's-style ""showroom"", down to service, which NEVER can get it right, mostly because I strongly believe they NEVER even look at your car and much less fix it (which they don't know how), but simply keep it parked in the back for several days without touching it, while I'm sure they issue astronomical bills to Fiat and Alfa Romeo for ""warranty work"" that they NEVER performed. Since KamKad (read Ken Strickler, by far the worst of them all and the mastermind of this fraudulent organization) bought the dealership a couple of years back, this place turned into complete crap, the turnover is so big that it makes your head spin, and since the new ownership took over it turned from a car dealership into a scamming machine. Darrell Creswell is the epitome of the worst and most despicable used car salesman, he will tell you what you want to hear but he will NEVER, EVER do what he promised, his only MO is to lie to you and screw you blind. On a personal level, after using all his deceptive ""charm"" to make me believe something that obviously NEVER happened and he never intended to from the beginning, after all the paperwork was signed he single-handedly robbed me of $7,000 in a factory buy-back deal including committing check fraud when they cashed a $3,000 check issued to my name by FCA as reimbursement of the original car extended warranty that was cancelled as a result of the buy-back.  The people that run it and their deceptive, dishonest and probably criminal practices created a dealership (two if you include Alfa Romeo Dallas, even though I sincerely hope that the rumors that this dealership was stripped from these xxxxxxxx is absolutely true) which is a complete disgrace and a deadly plague to the brands it represents, which is why for the past two years I have been relentlessly voicing to FCA Corporate the absolute necessity on their part to cut all their ties with these bunch of scammers, and I can only hope that finally my wish is now materializing. I sincerely hope that the complaints that have been filed with the State Attorney General will bring this fraudulent entity to an abrupt and definitive end, and that that the people in charge (especially Strickler and Creswell) will be held responsible for their dishonest activities. I can't wait for the day that the only signs affixed to the walls of this pathetic place will be those that say ""OUT OF BUSINESS"", and on my end what I can and WILL do is to continue to spread the worst possible word about them, and do everything in my power to steer away from this scamming machine as many people as I possibly can until I'll see them run completely into the ground, the only place disgustingly dishonest people like Strickler, Creswell and their goons deserve to be.",1.0
15,"April 03, 2019","Recently purchased a pre-owned vehicle. It’s about to be a month and going and still no payoff has been made or attempted for my trade in. Nor have I received the plates for my car or the registration. 

Tried calling the dealership numerious times, left voicemails but no one will answer or return calls even with voicemails. 

I don’t know what the deal is with the dealership, but I would not recommend doing buisness with people who don’t adhere to their contractual agreements. 

I just want them to send the payoff in and send me the plates and I’ll be a happy customer again. It’s easy. ",1.0

it is 3/26/1029 and the trade in is STILL not paid off. nor have they filed for my titles on the new car.
The Dealership ""takes messages"" but no one calls. I drove to dealership and was given a phone number for KAMKAD AUTOMOTIVE GROUP (parent company)...but thats a voicemail dead end as ""Emma"" (if she actually exists) NEVER returns voicemails.
I drove to KAMKAD's offices, and spoke to Beth Craze in Accounting on 3/12/1029 and was told they cut a check for the trade in pay off on 3/7/2019.  yet its still not paid off. I literally called 42 times in a row when someone answered and transferred me to Darrell Creswell's voice mail...he called me back once, said he had to ""look into it"" and then disappeared...won't return calls, texts or emails.

17,"March 20, 2019",BEWARE OF THIS DEALERSHIP THEY WILL MAKE YOU A NICE DEAL AND BE ALL FRIENDLY UPFRONT AND DO WHATEVER IT TAKES TO SELL YOU A CAR BUT AFTER THE TRANSACTION IS DONE GOOD LUCK GETTING AHOLD OF THEM. ON DEC 8TH I LEFT MY 2015 AUDI A3 THERE AS A TRADE IN AND LEFT WITH A GIULIA. TIL THIS DAY THEY HAVE NOT PAID OFF MY CAR AND THE COMPANY THEY NEED TO PAY IS THREATENING TO REPO THE CAR WHICH WOULD IMPACT MY CREDIT.

18,"January 28, 2019","Updated: It has now been 85 days since I leased a Stelvio and I still do not have any paperwork needed to obtain a permanent tag and the dealership still owes me money. The general manager is too busy responding to all of the complaints on Google to respond to any of my emails or phone calls. I cannot stress enough how bad of an experience this has been. Please do yourself a favor and go to a different dealership. Whatever deal they are offering is not worth it. 

I originally had a great buying experience and felt like a received a great deal. A few weeks after I signed my paperwork, the dealership reached out to let me know they had made a mistake and we needed to complete new paperwork. This took several weeks and the payment on my trade became due. I made the payment to prevent the account from going past due. It has now been over two months since I purchased my new car and my trade has yet to be paid off. I have purchased over five new vehicles in the past two years for me and for family members and I have never had an experience even close to this. I've filed a complaint with the Attorney General of Texas' consumer fraud office in hopes that they will be able to help. I should have listened to the other complaints on here. ",1.0
19,"January 23, 2019","I still have not received a check for my vehicle trade-in.  My husband and I traded in our 2013 Cadillac Escalade for a 2016 Cadillac Escalade in December 2018.  My husband found the vehicle listed on the internet.  We live in Friendswood and my husband negotiated the transaction over the phone with the dealership.  We purchased the vehicle for $56,000.  We agreed to a trade-in value on the 2013 vehicle of $21,000.  We agreed to receive a check of $10,000 for the trade-in and to use the remaining amount toward the 2016 vehicle with a financed amount of $45,500 via Suntrust Bank.  The dealership delivered the vehicle to our home on 12/10/18 and picked up the trade-in vehicle.  We signed paperwork (I still have not received the promised copy of the paperwork or registration information) and were assured that we would receive a check in the mail for the $10,000 balance on the trade-in.  It has now been 42 days and we have not received the $10,000.  Both my husband and I have contacted the dealership numerous times and we keep getting disregarded.  We were told by Karl on 1/11/19 that a ""check was in the mail"" on that day.  We have not received any check.  Every phone voicemail I have left has not been returned.  Today, I spoke to Brian, who identified himself as a manager, who told me he would email the accounting department and would copy me on the email.  I did not receive any email.  I have also left messages with the accounting department that have not been returned.  We are beyond exhausted with dealing with the suspect and quite frankly criminal activities of this business.  I have since filed complaints with the BBB and the state Attorney Generals office.  I should not have to fight, complain or beg for them to pay me the $10,000 they owe me for my trade in!!!

20,"January 02, 2019","This is a shady dealership!  They changed out my rims at my request when I bought it and In the mean time broke one of the air monitor stems. They super glued it back together and thought it would hold. 2 weeks later, it broke off inside the tire. Discount found it. I called the General Manager Brian and he ordered a new one and I went and got it replaced 2 days later. Sounds great, but...the service guys didn’t think my brand new light colored carpet deserved a paper floor mat and managed to get grease allover the floor mat and frame. Once again, they “took care if it”. They cleaned it using a very strong paint thinner smelling chemical that I can still smell a month later. So much for that new car smell!!  Bummer. For my trouble, they gave me a full tank of gas. It had a half tank already  and gas is the least of my worries. 
It’s been a couple days shy of 2 months and we still don’t have the tags on a brand new car. That is not acceptable. Our sales guy left almost immediately after we bought the car so we have talked to almost every person that will answer the phone regarding the tags. They ALL say they will call us right back. Even the General Manager Brian. Guess what!  They don’t call back!!  Now, I have car that I love that has CRAP for service, smells like turpentine with no tags. My Christmas present from my husband was a vanity plate. He’s going through chemo so figured that would be a perfect present he could ordee online. It’s been at the Rockwall tax office for over a month. They can’t give me the vanity plate until I turn in the dealership issued plate. So that’s awesome too. Just stay away. There are a ton of cars you can buy for $50k with a lot less headache!!!!",1.2
21,"December 27, 2018","Purchased a Lexus from this dealership 9/24 
Finished paperwork was never turned into the finance company after the approval . I was never notified of this , Oct when my 1st. Payment was due I go to make it with the loan company and was told dealership never turned in the paperwork. Go to the dealership that day , was told situation was turned over to the Corporate office who would be contacting me . Never her from anyone . Now the temp tag has expired . Go in meet a new GM who was nice . Received a temp tag , all the while I’m seeing that the vehicle that I’m driving is gone down in price on the website almost 5 grand of my price. 
Fast forward to Dec. they have reworked my deal higher interest rate and wouldn’t acknowledge the price difference. Walked away from the deal . 
Got my trade back , they had taken fog light clamp off the car, placed an old battery in etc. 
still haven’t received my money down back. 
So I go in because I was promise it to be overnighted . Was told it would come from Corp . Almost 3 weeks later still no money. 
I returned the vehicle without incident and have very professional. But these people have no respect for anyone’s time 
Business is business and they don’t handle business professionally !

23,"November 12, 2018","BUYER BEWARE. I am first responder with a local fire department and I would never recommend this dealership to anyone. I bought a used 2014 Jeep Wrangler for my wife from Fiat of McKinney in August 2018. They put an extended warranty with gap insurance into the sale without telling me for an extra $4000 on top of the total price. I declined the warranty and gap insurance because there was a 5 year, 100,000 mile manufacturer power train warranty on it. One month later, the Jeep breaks down in the pouring rain on a busy road while my wife was driving it. My mechanic diagnosed no compression in cylinder #4 and recommended a full engine replacement. I went to Fiat to address the issue and they told me to go to a Jeep dealership due it being a manufacturer warranty. The Jeep dealership informed me that the warranty was VOIDED because it was imported from CANADA. Fiat of McKinney FAILED to tell me the warranty was voided and that the Jeep was foreign at the time of sale. I met with the GM and he had the Jeep towed to the dealership and Fiat replaced a broken valve spring, O2 sensors, water pump, and left cyclinder head. A few days later, check engine light comes on and the Jeep starts shaking while turning. I took it back to Fiat and they replaced the O2 sensors AGAIN and replaced Ujoint/wheel hud. The GM and owner said no to a full refund and refused to make any other deal (KamKad Auto Group owns Fiat of McKinney). I proposed that they put a warranty on it or let me trade it in for a different vehicle dollar for dollar but they never gave me an answer. This is by far the WORST customer service I have ever received and I am surprised they stay in business. They are very shady and only care about making money! ",1.0

26,"August 01, 2018","Highly recommend. Technicians seem knowledgeable and honest. As a female, I have to deal with dishonesty in the car service industry quite often. I've been here for second opinions and they always come out cheaper and quicker. Thumbs up.",4.2
27,"June 29, 2018","I love my Alfa Romeo and the buying experience was very pleasant, but I regret to say that the service department is experiencing significant growing pains.  It is virtually impossible to have the call answered when you dial the service department extension, and the response time after leaving a message is unacceptable.  I have had to call the Sales dept  in order to get a hold of a service rep. 
In addition, the service department opens at 8:30AM making it very inconvenient to deal with a car issue before going to work in the morning.  Most service departments open at 7AM at the latest 
I hope that they will invest in resources to make the ownership experience as pleasant as the buying experience.  If not, it will be a pain owning this car in the long run.  I want Alfa to be successful in the US but they will have to significantly up their game to compete with other high-end car brands that pamper their customers.

Update: went in Monday 5/21 for a “service engine” warning.  Service dept manager said no loaner cars and technician could not even look at the car until at least Wednesday.  Called back on Tuesday, still no loaner car, technician would not get to the car until at least Thursday...  I need the car to get to work every day and hope the issue is not too serious and I’m damaging the engine by driving it.  Need to get it together!

New updates:  Can I give zero stars?  Technician finally got to my car about a week later.  It’s a sensor, he says, and needs to be ordered.  Will take about a week.  Obviously it takes 10 days.  Then a couple of days to actually fix it.  I was out of a car again for 2 weeks (seems to be the standard time they get anything done here).  Here is the kicker:  first, I had asked to look (again) at the speaker that was vibrating and they had already replaced once.  Well, they waited until AFTER the engine sensor arrived and they replaced it to START working on the speaker.  This added 2 days.  WHY WOULDN’t you fix that during the 10 days you are waiting for the sensor to come in?  Would that be too efficient?   But wait!  There is more!  I asked them to see why my brakes were squealing, with only 6000 miles on the car.  He says “i took it out myself after the technician did (for a joyride?) and the brakes are NOT squealing”.  I pick up the car and the first time I break...you guessed it!  The breaks squealed and they have  been since.  I sent them a video of it with the sound. 

You say “no, you are kidding, they can’t be sooo bad”.   Well, what if I told you the the VERY NEXT DAY after i picked up my car the SERVICE ENGINE” light came on again?!?  This was the very reason i had brought the car in in the first place and the very reason they had to order the $100 sensor from ITALY.  (Quick aside, why wouldn’t the dealership keep one of the $100 parts in stock?  In the state of Texas?  In the US?  In the North American continent??? Too good of a supply chain practice?  

Do you believe me now?  THIS PLACE IS NOT WORTH OF THE ALFA ROMEO NAME.  I dearly hope they lose it and someone with decent management practices and customer service opens one.  Otherwise, I’m screwed!

P.S.  no answer from the dealership to my review yet.  What could they say?",1.4
28,"April 21, 2018",Read the reviews below and Frank Ivens name keeps popping up.  I purchased a 2015 Jeep SRT last October.  I had car trouble driving my trade from Denver to McKinney and was told my $5000 trade was now worth $500.  The chrome wheels on the 2005 Grand Cherokee alone were worth $1000 before taking in the fact the rubber was only two weeks old.  I was stuck so I went ahead with the transaction and only asked Frank that he get me an English manual for the vehicle.  It's now 6 months and 10-15 emails later and I still don't have a manual.

color combo was right.  The car was misrepresented.  I was told several times by Frank Ivens what a nice car this is.  The drivers head rest didnt work, the license plate lamp was burnt out, one rear tire was so dry-rotted the you can see the steel belts for 12 inches, this tire was also a different brand from the others.  The front grille attachments were broken and the grille was loose, the lower front valance was broken and the other rear wheel rim was bent.  I called Darrell the GM and explained my disappointment.  I spent $1,500 to fix these things that should have been made right before they even put the car for sale.  I offered to split these costs, which I think is more than reasonable and he blew me off. He did email me their inspection report, which showed the grille issues, bad rear tires, and even the license plate lamp burned out. Gerson, the finance dude said he'd deduct the $599 dealer prep fee and he did not and even added an optional $150 paperwork fee to the $40k deal.  The car was not even detailed and was dirty and covered with brake dust.Karma is a xxxx of a thing, boys, and hope whoever reads this doesn't buy anything from these sleazy  used car salesmen",1.0

32,"February 22, 2018","I just bought a new 2018 Alfa Romeo 4C, and had a terrible sales experience. They were the only dealer in the area with a 4C in stock with the options I wanted. If not, I would have walked. You would think a dealership selling Alfa Romeos would give a premium sales experience. Instead their interest rates were misrepresnted to get me back in the dealership. Very dishonest! They told me they could meet or beat my bank's interest rates when they could not. For pointing this out, I was shouted at by my salesperson Frank Ivens and told I didn't understand how banks work. Really? Well, I understand how honesty works, if you don't know if you can do something, don't tell me you can do it. After this, he and the general manager attempted to influence my response on the post purchase survey by giving me a hat and a T-shirt that did not fit. Really people? You earn what goes on the survey, and if you did not earn it, I am not going to give you ""all 10'"" because you gave me a ball cap and an ill fitting T-shirt. That's not how I do business and neither should you. If you gave outstanding customer service, you would not have to try and influence customers to say you did.

Furthermore, the vehicle had to go back to detailing twice because detailing was not done properly. Even after being back to detailing twice, before driving off I noticed that the window trim was delaminating on the passanger's side. Frank said they would order a new one and replace it, but couldn't give a time. I didn't find out until 2 days later, and it was like pulling teeth to get an answer from him. He made me feel like I was a burden for having bought a car from him. After purchasing I also asked him what Alfa Romeo's roadside number was and he told me it should be in my owner's manual, and that I should look it up. One would think that a dealership selling Alfa Romeos could give me their roadside assistance number. When I pointed this out, he eventually did. I shouldn't have to point that fact out to my salesman. Overall, very dissatisfied with my experience from Alfa Romeo Fiat of McKinney. Their level of customer service is not adequet for Fiat, let alone Alfa Romeo. Stay away from this dealer!",1.4

35,"December 06, 2017","I went up to test drive the new AR Stelvio.  Loved the car and decided to buy.  We agreed on a price and they pull up a car in the color that I want.  Salesman does not go through ANYTHING on the car with me.  On top of that the car, which had supposedly just been washed looked more like they had just pushed dirt around.  I spot a ding in the driver's door and am assured that when I come back the next day, the door ding guy will take it out. I am handed the keys and sent on my way in my brand new car. Felt kind of weird to me that they would just hand me keys and tell me to have a nice day,  but I decide to shake it off and think this must be how they do it.  Get home, walking my husband through the vehicle's bells and whistles and there is no navi.  There was navi on the demo car and navi had been discussed.  Have to return to the dealership the next day to finish up paperwork and decide to bring it up then.

Salesman that was supposed to meet me is late.  Chris takes over and says something like ""they didn't go through the checklist with you before you drove off the lot""?  My reply - ""what checklist"".  So now I am starting to feel not so great about my new purchase.  Of course, there is no car in the lot that is the color I want with the features that were existent on the demo car - unless I spend more money to upgrade.  And when I come in the next day, I am advised that you have to make an appointment for the door ding guy, you don't just show up.  Hmmmmm, this is really starting to feel not so great.

The experience from the start was sub-par.  I buy the car and I love the car, but my buying experience was not fun, did not make me feel like a valued customer and really made me wish that I had bought my car elsewhere.  On the positive side, Chris did a great job trying to remedy the situation.  I shared with several folks at ARF McKinney that my experience left a bad taste in my mouth and was assured that the general manager would phone me personally the next day to hear my side of the story.  Am still waiting on that call.  Also, promised that my first oil change would be complimentary to offset some of the ick from my buying experience.  Not holding my breath for that either.  

I have tried to erase the whole experience from my memory bank in order to move on.  I do love my car, but would never buy from them again, bottom line.",1.3

All he other dealerships I've been to were very nice, modern, clean and very attentive. This one looks like a dealership from 30 years ago. Okay, fine but the real problem was apparently no one wants to sell cars. Every other dealership someone comes by quickly having seen you checking out the car to ask what they can do for you. Not here. Two guys sitting at their desks, not looking up from the computers, no interest. The manager seemed to be avoiding the floor. After 10 minutes of nothing, I left.

41,"April 06, 2017","Horrible Horrible! Hands down the worst experience I have ever had purchasing a car, I’ve had MANY. Complete lack of respect and a dealership which obviously doesn’t value its costumers or at the least only a select few. I purchased a car from this dealership after initially coming in to view and lease another but things did not work out. I bought the car after being pushed and consistently nagged about it; however this was ultimately my fault for agreeing to the purchase but was not the end of my degrading experience (I cannot recall the name of the sales associate I initially purchased the car from as I lost his card). I came in with quite a nice sized down payment and they happily took my money, I took possession of the vehicle on 3-17th 2017. The car wasn’t immaculate but very good condition which is no less than anyone should expect for the year and type of car that it was. I had the car for a period of 3 days before problems with it began to occur, (3-20th 2017) the radiator began to overheat into to the reservoir and blew the cap off and it overflowed into my garage and I had to call the car in for service where they kept it for a day and determined that it was a faulty cap and or thermostat that was to blame, fair enough, problem solved! The entire time asking them if there was anything they could do to get me into another car was ignored until after the first incident where I was told by a Mr. Darrell Creswell that he would help me to get into another vehicle of similar make because I was unpleased and felt mislead about the one I bought (until then I had been told there was nothing they could do or would do to make sure I was a fully satisfied after spending that kind of money), he told me on the 1st they would have a shipment of at least 10 more cars of the similar make and different options and I would be helped then. I called multiple times and left multiple messages asking to speak with him again before as well as after this date about details about what had been discussed previously but heard nothing back and was given the run around, what I was told by a member of Fiat/Alfa Romeo was never discussed again, surprise, no one was told about this (stupid me I had expected that someone may have kept their word, take what you will this). On 3-29-2017 I was at the McKinney Auto Splash auto spa where I had the car washed when in mid wash the radiator o the vehicle literally blew off the reservoir again and caused the entire bay the wash to be engulfed in smoke and the smell of burned radiator fluid. The dealership was notified once more and the car was collected and I was left to find a ride back to my town of residence, no one called to ensure that I was okay or needed a rental or references to obtain one etc. the car was in the shop for a period of 9 days and I was left without a car for more than a week after purchasing such an expensive sports car. They decided to send the vehicle to McKinney’s “Eldorado Chevrolet” to make sure there was nothing they had missed, I think a rather prudent choice, where they tinkered with the car and replaced a couple of parts and then drove it to make sure it was in good working order and returned the vehicle, as I hoped in the car to take a look (after it had been pulled out for me to take off the lot), with due service lights lit up on the digital gauge cluster notifying me of 0% oil life remaining, service was overdue? When the car was JUST at the dealership of origin undergoing diagnostics, yet they had failed to service the car, it was just purchased less than 3 weeks ago, one would expect that when buying a car with a price of 50k that these things would be done. This means that the car passed through the hands of several qualified technicians where the light would illuminate on the dash, in the middle of the digital display in red lights, every time the car was started, every time at which a tech would hit the ignore/cancel switch. It bothers me that A.) the service, a simple oil change was not completed before the car was given to me when it was initially purchased and possession was transferred but B.) They could not even bother to make me aware of the issue when for the last time I took possession of the vehicle. I was told by their lead technical advisor in the service department that the issue would be addressed the next day and to message him the next day and I said alright that will be great. Come the next day I messaged him multiple times until around 8pm at closing time and heard NOTHING. Ultimately I walked away from an experience that feels honestly degrading and quite bothersome due to the lack of respect and value that I would expect from such a heavy name like Alfa Romeo or Fiat, perhaps I was mistaken to assume? It leaves me with a very bad taste in my mouth which I hope never to experience again. I will absolutely NEVER consider doing business with even a dealership of the same make either.",1.0

The salesman I dealt with (I won't mention his name out of respect) used very questionable tactics. I had a trade-in car, and after some haggling, I told him if he could get me $30k for my trade in, we would have a deal. I told him not to pull my credit until we agreed on a number.  He then said ""ok I'll talk to my manager."" He even made me sign stating that I would agree to buy his fiat if his manager got me $30k for my trade in. A few minutes later, he comes back and says ""ok my manager said to go ahead with it."" Wouldn't any rational, reasonable human think that this means they agreed to the $30k? But   no, after he submits my credit app and pulls a hard inquiry (which in fact lowers my score), he tells me that it was actually $29k and not $30k. First disappointment- Ok so not a deal breaker yet, and after I express disapproval, we haggle to raise my trade in few hundred more and throw in a navi (which only costs $400 since it's just a chip that needs to be inserted into the unit). However, after all the paperwork is done, including all the contracts, I asked to confirm about the navi and was told it was not part of the deal!  This is totally a bait n switch tactic.  Very disappointed that all this time and work was done for nothing, not to mention the hard credit inquiry. I really wish management would enforce more ethical tactics.",1.2

Then however Joey came down and sat with me to go over options. He told me that he was going to make some calls to the bank and see what he could do.

No surprises, no gimmicks, no hassles, no bait and switch.  I was  in my car and driving home in roughly an hour after arriving at the dealership.  Additionally, my salesman, Miguel, took the time to acquaint me with special features of the car (purchased used), a Toyota Prius, not normally sold at this dealership.  Everything Miguel took the time to tell me has been accurate and useful.  It is your choice whether to deal with this team.  

Even after I purchased the vehicle, the dealership followed up with me to see if there were any issues they needed to help resolved.  That is a strong indicator to me that these folks care, and that the service doesn't stop immediately after the sale.

I rated the price great.  What is good, what is great, I cannot tell you. The price was good enough for me fly from San Antonio to McKinney and buy the car, so clearly I was happy.  If I am in the market for another car (new Fiat), I would use this team again.  'Nuff said.",5.0

I flew from Nebraska to pick up the van and drive it back. The salesman assured me that the van was mechanically sound. My first question was if the AWD(all wheel drive) system was working properly because we have harsh winters in Nebraska. He assured me it was all good to go. I got to Texas and took the van for a test drive and it felt fine but there was no way of telling if the AWD system was working or not because the roads were clear and simply putting it on a vehicle lift and engaging drive would not put any ""load"" on the front wheels. I drove it home in good faith only to find out through a very effective test, that the AWD system was completely non-functional. I put the rear wheels just off the ground with a floor jack, put it in gear and absolutely nothing from the front wheels.
