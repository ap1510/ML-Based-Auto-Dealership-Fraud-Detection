9,"April 08, 2019","My name is Ray Blevins and I recently purchased online a 2014 ford F 150. I was contacted by Cody Faulkner of Stanley Ford and he listened to what I was interested in. I informed him I was in Amarillo and seen this truck and I wanted it! I informed Cody of my trade in that I had planned to use in this purchase. Cody was very quick to keep me informed of ALL the proceedings and steps he was taking on what was happening as it was happening. Here in Amarillo there is no way I would get this outstanding service from any dealership!  Cody not only let me know at all times what was going on during working hours, he answered ALL my questions after hours into the 10:00 pm evening. Cody did this with a great attitude and a “no problem, happy to help” customer service. Cody not only made sure I got what wanted, he had it delivered to my front door.....4 hours away!!!!!  Who does this man? I will and have already told people about this and advised them to deal with STANLEY FORD in Eastland Texas for fantastic service. I gave them Cody Faulkner’s name for awesome service. ",5.0
