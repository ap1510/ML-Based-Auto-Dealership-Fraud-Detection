1,"January 08, 2017","I am not one to leave a review, ever. After the entire process of trading a vehicle at this place, I had come to the conclusion, that car buying, and selling can leave the consumer very vulnerable. Long story short, I signed a contract on 10-10-16, and the finance guy didnt get the deal done untill days before Thanksgiving. I was told they were waiting on tax return documents to come back. After doing some research myself, that was in fact untrue. My trade-in had a loan at a local credit union, and the loan was showing to be late due to the pay off not being received for almost 2 months. I took a big hit on my credit score with the payment not being made. Then, the icing on the cake was getting a call from the finance manager (Mr Herrera) that I needed to come in and sign a new contract, because the original numbers wouldnt work with the bank, and this time around I needed 1000.00 down to complete the deal. I said no, I just want my trade back and want to be done with this place. He screamed at me over the phone that they didnt need my money, and went on and on about how they lost so much money on my deal. Which he then later called and apologized for his behavior on the phone, Im guessing someone heard him yelling at me. Once again, not my problem, I just wanted my truck back. I went back up there the following day after work, (mind you, its quite a drive) with my small children to resign the paperwork. Not one apology, not one sorry for the inconvenience, but rather a confused almost rude finance guy. He was in a hurry to get me out of there. Finally after almost 2 months of driving a vehicle I wasnt even sure that I owned,  I was done with this place.  I wasnt someone going in with a bad credit score, or needed a last resort, I was shopping here because I had heard great things, so I went. It was a nightmare, and did I mention I went through this process 9 months pregnant? Needless to say I wont recommend any of my clients/friends, I cant imagine anyone having to go through that nonsense. On the flip-side, Khan was super nice, and not his fault the finance department was horrible.",2.0
2,"February 01, 2016","Bought a truck there last year. Took it to a local dealership because something was rattling in the dash.The other dealers found the tracking device in my truck. The dealership in Port Lavaca installed this device without my knowledge. The 2014 GMC  Denali I purchased has been paid for in full, less than a year after I drove it off their lot. They added over $3,600.00 dollars to the cost of my truck which I didn't know about it till I paid it off. In which they had to reimburse me for. I would not trust this dealership and will never buy a vehicle from them again in my life. If you do buy one from them take it straight to another dealer and get the  GPS tracking device pulled out of it. You talking about an invasion of privacy. Unheard of behavior. Don't trust these people or this dealership.    ",1.0
