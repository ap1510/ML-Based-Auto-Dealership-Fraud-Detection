5,"June 22, 2020","In October of 2019, I submitted an electronic request for more information on a Ram truck.  I was 9 months away from my lease ending on an Infinity Q60 lease for my wife, who was interested in a truck.  At the time, I was only shopping looking for different brands of trucks.  Sam followed up. 

Sam was persistent.  He checked in with me regularly understanding that I was months away from making a decision on a truck. His persistence paid off.  Three months from my lease ending, I ordered a Ram 1500 Rebel (fully loaded), and on Friday, June 18 2020 my wife’s truck arrived.  

We haven’t driven much at all, but all indicators are that my wife will love it.  Thank you, Sam! ",4.2

119,"January 24, 2020","The sale went fine, but then I had a problem that they did not resolve.  The driver's side front time would not hold air.  I kept airing it up and it kept loosing air.  I live 70 miles from Lithia so I took it to the Dodge house near me.  First off, the car did not have the lug key.  In order to check the tire, they had to take the tire off.  Not possible without the key.  So I called Lithia and told them my problem.  I spoke to one of the 2 salesmen (Tyler) who had made my sale.  I was told the car sold ""as is"" and he was very sorry, but could not help.  So I paid the dealer near me $65 to break off the lugs.  They discovered that the tire had been patched and air was leaking around the patch, and that I would need a new tire.... to the tune of $270.  I called Lithia and spoke to a manager (Michael) and explained my problem.  He too said, the car sold ""as is"" and ""sorry"" they could not help me.  My total bill was $437.45.  Lithia ""certified"" the car before I drove it off the lot.  Doesn't that mean they checked it out?  Doesn't it mean they should have at least noticed that I did not have a lug key?  I even think they should have discovered that the tire could not hold air.  The car I bought was a 2018 Dodge Charger with 19,900 miles on it.  I am very UN happy with customer service.  They wanted me happy before I signed the papers, but they don't really care about me now that the deal is done.  Besides this:  They got me in the door because they promised that they had located the very car I was searching for online.  When they contacted us, they said it was someplace in another town, but couldn't tell me where it was.  Then when I drove to Lithia, they said, ""oh, it just sold"", and offered me what they had on their lot.  Why did I fall for that???  I will never buy another car from Lithia and any chance I get, I will tell my story.",1.8

167,"November 30, 2019","We have purchased several Jeep brand vehicles from Lithia in Bryan; and have had a good experience every time. This most recent buying experience was possibly the most enjoyable to date. It helps when you’re dealing with the same great salesperson who sold you the previous two Jeeps. Brandon V. is awesome to work with. Not pushy at all, and more importantly, because we’ve worked with him before, I feel as though I can trust him. After a ton of research, I told him what I wanted; on both the new Jeep and for my trade, and we got the deal done. The vehicle price and fees were fair with no bogus “rip off” charges being added to the deal. There was no endless back and forth haggling, and the best part is, I didn’t have to spend all day at the dealership. 

After several purchases at Lithia (and one absolutely horrible experience at another Jeep dealership in Tomball to compare it to), I can say with confidence that the folks at Lithia in Bryan are good, honest people that care about their customers as much as they care about the sale. They aren’t going to be dishonest and try and screw your over and then forget about you when you drive off the lot. 

Over the years, Lithia in Bryan has earned a loyal customer, as well as all of my future business when it comes to buying (and servicing) my Jeep vehicles. 

Lithia, and specifically Brandon Veverica, thank you for restoring my faith in honest car dealerships again. ",5.0

This was by far the best experience I have ever had at a car dealership. Our salesman Eric was AWESOME!

He went out of his way to make sure that we got into something that not only worked well for us in our daily lives and financially but he made sure it was something we loved as well. I know that car shopping can be a very stressful and sometimes scary experience.

BUT once they make the sale, its like, ok we are done, through with you. My jeep pulled to the rifht, so I put it in Fri alinement it took 3 ttys before they got it right & only then because I made someone ride with me & show them that they HAD NOT FIXED IT. Also we have yet to receive our licenses plates & tags, we have yet to receive our payment info. I have made numerous calls & trips up there over this & all I get is, I don't know, or in so sorry, or I'll check & get back with you, which is a crock because they LIE & don't return calls. Finally Friday I talked with someone in finance, he could not explain any of it, imagine that, but gave me Chrysler capitals number for me to call & do his job! So I did & they start with I'm 6 days late on my payment, boy, I told them to back the truck up & listen to a little story & they bets not mark me late. Finally got that straight, but they never called back on plates as he said he would when he gave me the phone number. So NO DO NOT EVER BUY FROM THESE MORONS!",2.8

The truck was pulled and ready as soon as we got there.  the test drive experience was like non other I've experienced before.  We knew everything about that truck by the time we returned to dealership.  Albert built the trust we had in him in a very short period of time.

566,"August 17, 2018","A couple years back we looked in to getting a truck and were told by Mike Garza that we would be approved but after a couple weeks were told to give it back because we were not approved. Mike wanted us to pay for the miles we had used on the truck with the down payment we had given the dealer and I told him I would not be paying for those miles if it wasn’t my fault we were given the truck with out it being fully approved, as I wanted the truck but they were taking it away from me... Mike was not very happy with that... after that I have gotten at least four other trucks with this dealer. A couple weeks back one of my new trucks had a problem and I took it in for service at least two times and they could not fix the problem. I was forced to give back the truck and try to get a new one. I wasn’t planning on getting a new truck but since my truck had been the service station for a couple months now. When we were about to sign the papers to be given the truck I was asked for a guaranteed check and it could not be guaranteed because Mike did not approve it... I don’t think he should be mixing a problem that happened many years ago with a client they have had for a long time. My truck was broken, that could not fix it and a top of that he was being petty about it. The rest of the team has been great and outstanding and I really appreciate them, especially Jennifer Liebengood. I can’t complain on the rest of the dealer staff as they have been of great help but I do think that especially coming from management I would feel that I’m being denied for personal problems... so my 5 stars are for the rest of the team except for Mike. I have recommended this dealer and even my dad got Dodge 3500 with this dealer... ",5.0

671,"June 04, 2018","We decided on my daughters first car Friday and were told it would be detailed beautifully and could pick it up Monday. Upon pick up, it was EXACTLY the same as it was on Friday...so she waited ALL weekend for NO reason. Nobody from your staff said a word of apology upon pickup.  The interior had mud on floor boards and greasy spray spots all over the inside as though someone had sprayed it but then didn't bother to wipe it down, as well as white marks and grit which we wiped up off all the seats. It was gross- for lack of a better word. 
I hope the manager of the detailing service department and owner of this dealership see this review because our entire family WAS SO DISAPPOINTED. We have nine in our family.
Yall should truly consider how a customer feels when purchasing a car-it  is an investment and should be treated with great care especially when someone is purchasing for the first time. Made me sick to see it so nasty- the kid went from excited to seeing that still nasty... What a shame. We have two more cars for which we were considering purchasing this summer, but not from this dealership, as they cant even clean an obviously simple area-they just didn't clean it at all... obviously they just don't care.

683,"May 30, 2018","We have loved our van, which we bought from Lithia in 2013. We purchased lifetime oil changes and a lifetime warranty with the original sale of the van. I have always received GREAT service until the last year or so. Getting my oil changed has become a pain and no one every returns a phone call.

Well, on May 16 I was driving and my van wouldn't accelerate at a green light but the engine was reeving - figured something was wrong with my transmission. Got the van to a parking lot on the A&M campus and call Chrysler's Roadside assistance. They sent a tow truck. While I was waiting received a rude call from the service advisor because he had to open a ticket since he was notified my from Chrysler my van was coming.  That was at around 1pm. At around 2pm the tow truck came for the van.

I waited most of the day on Thursday, May 17 to hear that they had my van and what was up. At 3pm I caved and called. I was told they would have my service advisor call me.

Friday, May 17, I called at 10am to find out if they had my van and again was told that they would ask my service advisor to call me . I called back at 3:30 because I needed to know if my van actually got to the service center or not. The service witch board staff member hunted someone down who confirmed my van was there and said they would put in a notice to have my service advisor call me back.

On Monday, May 21st I called at 10am to see if someone could tell me something. I in no means was expecting my car to be fixed in less than a week but some information, communication would have been nice. Again told they would ping my service advisor to call me.

On Wednesday, May 23rd at 5:01pm received a phone call from my service advisor who told me ""Bad News, your transmission is shot. I won't be able to tell you anything else until Friday at the earliest. I'm thinking you are telling me nothing I didn't already no but ok.

Friday, May 25th comes and goes with no information. I give them the benefit of the doubt that Monday is a holiday and I'll hear something on Tuesday, May 29. No surprise at this point - crickets.

I just called at 11am this morning, May 23, and was informed, you guessed it they would let my service advisor know I called and he would give me a call back!!!!!

Never have I been given a two week run around about what is wrong with my car. No request to authorize work, what it might cost me - NOTHING at All. With this service we will never buy from Lithia and or use their service department again. I'll go to Houston or Austin for the new Pacifica when its time to replace this van. I love my van but can't handle this awful service - if you can even call it service.",1.0

712,"May 11, 2018","I hate going to car dealerships.  They are high pressure and hard sell.  So, I was not looking forward to dealing with another new car dealer but, they had the vehicle I was interested in.  This time was different.  I found the vehicle on an internet site.  The dealer was 120 miles away.  I checked the dealer reviews on the website and came across a good review for a salesperson named Jennifer.  So when I called the dealer to see if the vehicle was still available I thought,""What the heck"" and I asked for Jennifer based on the review.  When she said the vehicle was still available I said I didn't want to drive 2 hours to find out it was no longer there.  She assured me she did not operate that way so I made an appointment for the next day.   When we arrived she said we could take the car out for a test drive, alone.  We took our time.  We stopped in an empty parking lot and inspected the vehicle bumper to bumper without the pressure of someone looking over our shoulder or trying to impress us on how special the radio knobs are.  When we returned we sat with Jennifer and told her our concerns.  Price was not an issue as it was, in my opinion, a fair price.  We  did have a couple issues we wanted addressed.  She had to go back and forth with her ""boss"" to make this deal work but, never once, did she try to turn us over to someone else.  Make no mistake, Jennifer's job is to sell vehicles but she made the buying process very non-stressful.  So we decided on the price, options, and financing which brings us to the final stage:  the dreaded Paperwork!  We were introduced to Josh, our Finance Manager.  Josh's job is to complete the paperwork and offer other products (i.e. Gap Insurance, Extended Warranties, etc) for sale.  Having been in the business (in a past life) I went in knowing I did not want either Gap or Extended Warranty.  His job his to explain it, anyways.  I have sold Extended Warranties in the past and know that a lot of 3rd party companies that provide these warranties really go out of their way to deny claims.  When I asked Josh what company backed this warranty  I was very surprised when he told me it was MOPAR(Chrysler).  I immediately bought the warranty knowing it was backed by a company that would be more interested in preserving it's reputation than in denying claims.  It was well worth the drive to do business with Jennifer and Josh.  My wife, and I, are very happy with our 2016 Jeep Cherokee and would not hesitate to do business with this dealer again.  Thanks Jennifer and Josh",5.0

Now I have to go back into the dealership, sign another form to transfer the plates, and apparently wait another month before I have tags and don't have to deal with this dealership again.

Since my purchase he's been phenomenal at following up and is even available via text to answer all my questions. Go see Jake!!!!! You won regret it!",5.0

My vehicle was considered a total loss and didn't really see help coming from anywhere besides starting all the way over on saving money just for a down payment. We received a exclusive offer from my insurance company and Lithia was the first place we went. From the time we got out the vehicle Zach took care of us. We had a appt with another rep but Zach met us at our vehicle and then took control of the situation. He really sold me on getting the 2016 Chrysler 200 Anniversary edition. My husband fell in love with in the moment he seen it but I had my mind set on a Jeep. We took it for a test drive and I fell in love.

949,"August 15, 2016",i had really bad experience with Lithia lately . i am already a Jeep owner over seas and also a Jeep Club member overseas and I know how Chrysler take care of there clients but what happened to me lately in Bryan make me Sad .... I have visited Lithia location to Test drive Honda Accord Hybrid touring 2014 and i drove the car i liked the car but when we sit on the table from the beginning Sam(sales man) told me different price than the internet price that i found in their web site !!!! and asked him to check his web site and i was invited from kelly (sales Manger) after i offered the price i planned to pay but unfortunately we could not reach a deal after some discount so i decide to postponed my decision tell i check some other cars .two days later i sent Kelly tell him i will come to get the car he forget about the last price that i got from Sam then i told him no way i am not going through this ....Then he sent me couple of mails that he agree on the last price i got from Sam .I went on foot since i do not live so far Kelly call and pick me in the middle of the way and i appreciate that but it was the only thing i appreciated that day.He takes me directly to sign the papers and give the full amount payment by cheque to Jiff(finanlater on Sam took me to get the care and leave one i am inside the car on front of the driving car there was two wind shield cracks i told Sam about them he replied it is preowned car i replied these cracks was not in the car when i drove it for a test and at that time i walked around the car to check it and i found two dots of paints to cover tiny scratch and i accepted it and i will never miss something clear like this specially the are directly in front of my eys and being an Engineer and a business man at the same it became a habit for me to notice any thing .Sam said he will call the wind shield man to fill an fix it i said fine.when the man came he said this cracks are big and can not be repaired and the wind sheild must be replaced.Then Sam went inside the administration building and come after few minute (of course speaking with somebody) and said no we can not do any thing and you already signed the documents !!!! ( in my mind it means i did a mistake to trust Kelly and signed the documents before i check the car for the second time !!! or wait till i am on the driver seat ready to go!!!)Then i went to Jiff (account manager ) he went with some computer Clark stuff and talked to them and tell me it is okey they will replace it i said okey .Sam invited me to his desk and leave me for a while then come back and said we can not do the internet market manger should agree (Kelly) i said no way . he talked about there is no big profit margin i replied if so you should not accept the deal and it is not the proper time now to talk about that he said he has a deal i replied what deal ??!!!!! he said let me leave you for a while of course went to Kelly then he came and said you pay half the wind shield the price and we pay the other half that made me sick i said lets finish this then i went to Jiff to tell him what they did but it seems he has nothing to do and this is Kelly !! on Monday they will replace the glass they broke and i will pay the half of its price as a punishment for me to trust them and choose Lithia to deal with instead of telling me they are sorry for wasting my time and make me frustrated I never had bad experience like this it is not only a matter of money it is a matter of trust which is very important for any business to succeed Chrysler over seas always follow there customers after any visit to make them satisfied and dealers keep there client satisfied so we trust them this what makes me go to you but now i am completely frustrated few days later general manger contact me by regular mail asking for my satisfaction!!

They kept a record of what I was interested in on file and as soon as a vehicle presented itself they contacted me. I went in the next day and examined the auto and found that it was exactly what I wanted.  The sales staff worked with me to get a fair deal that was profitable to everyone involved.  All their promises were kept and they went out of their way to make sure that my buying experience was the best possible.

I Pre-scheduled a 4:30 pm appointment, explained I had to be at a meeting at 6:00pm and just needed an oil change. So that gives them a good hour to get it done right? Could not even get it moved into service bay before 5:30. This is not the first experience I have had with them . I had hired them to install an autostart system and that took three times to get it to work properly. They lost pieces of my Truck and had to order more. Ultimately I had to have them ship it to me and install myself. I later Found screws loose , rubber weatherstripping folded over and creased, still leaks road noise to this say. It makes you angry to buy a new vehicle and have someone tear it up in the efforts of improvement. Last oil change I needed a courtesy car ride home. I took them almost 3 hrs to get me the ride.

955,"July 21, 2016","My mom and I came to this dealership after many bad experiences in surrounding areas. We were feeling defeated before we even walked into the door. However, when we were introduced to Murray, we knew we were in the right place. Murray took the time to listen to our story about how we even arrived at Lithia in the first place and then he addressed our concerns and helped us find the right car. Before we test drove the car, he did something amazing that neither my mom nor I have ever seen a car salesman do. He asked me to stand at the front of the car with him before I got in and just explained all of the features, crash ratings and safety, HOW and WHY the car was built like it was and the positives that has on all around performance. After we decided on that car, we told Murray what we were comfortable paying and somehow he pulled it off. At first it seemed impossible but he, along with his financial team, did everything he could to make it work for me. Murray got the price down to what I wanted to pay and then we got to meet with Chris to sign all the paperwork. Chris was a very personable guy, he knew how to make us feel comfortable and he took his time explaining everything and answered all of our questions in detail. It was obvious that he really knew what he was talking about and he cared about getting us in our new car! Murray and Chris really were our saving grace. We had low expectations just walking in the door because of the other dealerships we dealt with. However, Lithia was completely different.

He did everything he could to get us into the car that we wanted. We went in looking for a used car we saw online. We tried the numbers many different ways, and it didn't look like we were able to make it work with where we wanted to be price wise. My husband suggested looking at new and I thought he was crazy! We ended up getting the NEW car for less than the used car we looked at originally! They were able to get us several instant rebates and adjusted the totals on our trades to get us where we wanted to be. We never once felt pressured in ANY way and they even told us to sleep on it and make sure that's what we were going to be happy with, that they didn't want us to make an impulse decision and wish we had gone with something else later. That was the Last day of the month AND the last day of the quarter and I'm sure they had quite a few goals they had to meet, but it gave us peace of mind to know we weren't being pressured to make a decision right then and we couldn't be happier with our purchase!

962,"June 22, 2016","For starters the service drive at this place (if you could call it that) is a joke. You pull up to a relatively small drive way in front of one roll up door. The area is usually jammed with traffic. Inside are some small shoddy looking plywood shacks with sliding glass doors. That's where you might find a service writer. It looks like a place where you would trade scrap iron or pickup junk parts. Apparently they have no interest in investing in a decent reception area. All of the other dealerships in this area have modern hotel style areas for service check in. If the appearance was all that was wrong I would be ok but the appearance of the place matches what you get for service. My wife brought her new RAM 1500 in for a water leak. Let me mention we purchased the truck new at this same dealership. The trucks headliner would be soaked after every rain. it was stained from this constant soaking. The truck only had 5000 miles on it. We took it in and a service writer looked at it. He said he would have to take picture and get a headliner approved. OK no problem with that. Weeks later and we never receive a phone call. After my wife calls them a half dozen times or so they finally tell her to bring it in. She does. It stays there all day and she never receives a call. Attempts to reach anyone about the status are futile. We finally just go to the dealership at 5:30PM. We can't find our service writer. We finally go to the cashier window. The woman had no paperwork or information on our vehicle. She disappeared for about 5 minutes and said the truck was ready but she has no paperwork. She has no idea what or if anything was repaired. She only knows that the truck is outside somewhere with the keys in it. We found the truck and left. It could have been stolen the way it was left there. The next day after several phone calls by my wife she finds out from someone there that a airbag safety recall was performed and the gasket on third brake lamp was replaced to fix the water leak. They also told her a headliner was on back order. We received paperwork for the visit about four weeks later. The paperwork had no mention of the back ordered headliner. My wife made several calls over the next few weeks. It was hard to get anyone or a response. It seems the headliner is on intergalactic back order. We have never received a call back about this part on order. It has been many months now. Another thing we still have the water leak. I would say they didn't do a leak test at all.

981,"February 14, 2016","On 09/28/2015 I brought my wife's 2010 Jeep Liberty (68,000 miles) to Lithia Chrysler Jeep Dodge of Bryan, Tx to diagnose a problem with the Sky Slider Sunroof. After 3 days, the service writer notified us of the frame rail being broken and needing replacement. My vehicle was resubmitted to the dealership along with all warranty information on 09/30/2015. The service writer and warranty company had communication problems, plus the service dept ran into problems with the install which was no big  concern. However, 41 days later (11/10/2015), I receive a call from the service writer stating my vehicle is ready for pick up. I explained because of my work schedule, we wont be able to pick it up until Friday(11/13/2015). My wife and I arrive to the dealership that morning only to be told the mechanics had taken the sunroof back out of the vehicle and reinstalled it without letting the service writer know. After apologies, we got the vehicle back a day later, but in horrible shape. The headliner was ruined, roof light and ceiling moldings missing, plus side and rear trunk moldings were torn or completely missing. Worst of all, the front seats had mold stains from sitting water and the front metal seat braces mounted to the floor were rusted, evidence the vehicle had been left outside with the malfunctioned sunroof.  
The service writer apologized profusely and assured me a new headliner had been ordered for replacement along with the missing components. Highly upset, we left still optimistic the dealership would make the corrections. Two days later on a Monday in 5 o'clock traffic, my wife and 2 yr old son are on Texas ave when the Jeep shutters and completely dies. Frantic, my wife calls me where I have to leave work to help. Upon arrival, I find the vehicle without power. I open the hood to find the missing trunk molding laying across the engine and resting on the drive belt, plus the battery negative cable not mounted to the terminal. After reattaching the cable and removing the molding from the motor, they were able to get home. I met face to face with the service writer the next day, to show evidence of the sloppy work his dealership had provided. After apologizing more, I was told my vehicle would be taken care of. 

2 weeks and no notifications later of when my vehicle would be repaired, I took the jeep up to the dealership and spoke directly with General Manager, Coy Alexander. Mr Alexander was shown the vehicle and his service department's work. He assured me the vehicle would be repaired. My vehicle arrived back at the dealership on 12/07/2015.....40 days later, we are notified that the vehicle is ready. The dealership cleaned the seats, and painted the rusted seat brackets. A new headliner was installed but very poorly. Once again, grease fingerprints are on the headliner and, though the missing roof pieces are replaced, other smaller moldings (visor holder and hanger) have completely fallen out of the headliner due to not being reattached with the original mounting screws but simply ""glued"" back on. The drivers side molding under the dash is completely missing (there was no reason for it to ever be removed) and the left bumper has been clearly scratched as if backed into something. 

Once again, I took the vehicle BACK up to the dealership and spoke with Coy Alexander and Kalin Dupper, the Service Manager. Unsatisfied with their explanations/excuses, I simply returned two weeks later to retrieve the ordered missing parts.  I will no longer leave my vehicle, or any vehicle for that matter, in their care. 
In conclusion, Lithia Chrysler Jeep Dodge of Bryan had my vehicle a total of 86 days (not including the 3 day diagnostic) and though the sunroof is repaired, my vehicle left this service department in worse shape than it arrived. The blatant apathy of all staff involved proved all I needed to know about their professionalism, commitment to customer satisfaction, integrity of character and trustworthiness.

983,"February 06, 2016",I recently took my 2008 Dodge Charger in to get two recalls fixed on the ignition node module and the airbag defibaliator. They fixed the recall and the next day when went to use my horn it wouldn't work I brought it in that Saturday and they ran diagnostics and found nothing wrong with the cars electrical system of the car so they took the airbag out and found that they broke a pin in the clockspring. They told me they had to order a part and that it was on back order they never offered me a loaner car until the part came in. So I took my car home that Saturday and Sunday when I came home from church my engine light was on and my car started shaking vigorously and my interior and headlights started dimming and flickering I took my car back that Monday and never heard anything from them. I called Tuesday and nobody knew anything about my car. I was calling Tracey Lang a service advisor she wouldn't return my calls and she wouldn't call me to let me know anything I had to call her and threaten to sue before she called me back and told me they were looking at my car. Wednesday came and she never called me like she was supposed to so Thursday I went there to see what was going on she didn't know anything and couldn't tell me anything about my car. She went to talk to a service tech and told me that my engine harness wiring had went bad. I asked her how does something like that go bad from Saturday afternoon to Sunday? I have diagnostic paperwork from there service center that says they check for codes and no codes were found on Saturday and Sunday night my car started going crazy. Now they've had my car since Monday here it is Saturday they still don't know anything and they still haven't called me and told me anything I've been calling the customer service center and I've contacted the gen manager. I don't understand how my car just went haywire in one night. I should've never brought my car back there especially after the terrible service I received last year. After they so called fixed my bleeder hose and thermostat housing I had to replace my engine because they found sludge in the engine and water had leaked into the engine. Then when I took it to another mechanic shop to get the new engine he told me that they didn't even put it back together correctly. I don't know who they have working for them in there service center or even if they know what they're doing but I know that every time I get my car worked on by them I have to spend thousands of dollar. Right now my bill is $2300 in parts in labor. That's another thing they charge a rediculous rate of $110 an hour and they jack up the price of there parts. I looked on Chryslers website and found the part I needed listed for under $500 but they told me the part cost $1400. I'm starting to believe that they're service department is purposely messing with people's cars who come in with simple problems so that they have to come back and spend more money to fix stuff that they broke. I wouldn't recommend they're service department to anyone and it's my personal vow that I will never buy another dodge product from this establishment and I'll never take any car dodge or not to there  service department is terrible and there general a manager coy Alexander is horrible. ,1.0

It was recommended to me that I give Lithia a shot, well I did and I could not be happier.

P.s.  Rizwan is the best service advisor you have in my opinion because he is the only advisor to properly greet me and even if he has a customer he makes sure I am acknowledged and will be waited on soon.  He calls back when I have a question.  He was there when I bought my first truck and then they moved him to the oil change bay and then back.  He was severely missed I had visited multiple times when he was not there and I would have to wait 20+ minutes.  It's like no one even cared.  Dude needs a raise.  Thanks.

1027,"November 12, 2014","At 30k miles my 2008 Jeep Wrangler 2-door had a leaking front right axle seal. At this time I was still under warranty and they fixed it without issue. At 65k miles the same seal went out. I made an appointment for 7:30 am on a Tuesday to get it looked at. On that Wednesday around 2 pm, a day and a half later, they finally looked at it. This lead to lost work hours and an inconvenience finding a way to work, how an appointment does not take priority is beyond me. If they were behind schedule, why not reschedule me to insure a good service experience?
When they finally looked at it, they quoted me for four hours of labor and $100 dollars in parts (which cost about 50 from retail stores). They charge an outrageous hourly rate of $110/hour and gave me a total quote of $540. Disregarding that I have other quotes for the same work at about $200, they showed that the first repair done under warranty only took 2.2 hours. They disregarded that fact and planned to charge a flat 4 hours of labor. After talking to management about the issue, they were uncooperative and said that I had not kept up with maintenance (basically, gone to them and charged high rates for work I do myself). Irregardless, they should have fixed it correctly the first time or stood behind their work. Axle seals are not a common maintenance issue and I am troubled at the fact that they did not see this as a fault of their own. Needless to say, I will never take my Jeep there again and have decided against buying a new Jeep Grand Cherokee, which my wife and I had been considering.... I am disheartened that Chrysler Group LLC cannot stand behind their products and provide a better quality of service to loyal customers. My family has always been Jeep fans and I hate to think that this has cast a shadow on a long heritage of the name Jeep, for my family and myself.

1039,"May 02, 2014","I wanted to wait at least a year from the purchase of my new vehicle to write a review.  I purchased my 2013 Dodge Challenger on December 31, 2012.  My salesman was wonderful and I wish I could deal with him for everything on my car.  Unfortunately, I have not been impressed with their service department.  First, there is a safety issue with my hood.  It randomly pops up while driving! I called and they had me bring it in.  Upon their ""thorough"" inspection, they could not find the problem.  However, when stated to us, ""there's nothing wrong with the hood.""  A hood on a car should NOT randomly pop up.  It is a serious safety issue when driving.  I asked how much would a new latch be and he said he didn't know. I told him I thought the cost of a new latch would be priceless when compared to the lives of myself and my four month old son.  Since they did nothing but clean and grease the latch, they disagree and don't take safety serious.  Also, after only 14,000 miles on the factory tires, they needed to be replaced.  I spent $1k on a new set of tires at a local tire shop.  I trust this tire shop and they said that no matter how hard they tried, they couldn't get the camber correct.  They said it would have to be fixed by the dealer.   I believed something was wrong with the car, so I took it in to the dealership.  They said it was either a bad set of tires or the alignment.  After they realigned it, another $150, they sent me on my way.  The new set of tires only lasted 5,000 miles.  I took my car back to the same tire shop, bought a new set of tires, and received a print out showing that the camber does not match up.  After taking it back to the dealership, I was told that there were no problems with the car's suspension but the toe was off.  When asked why they didn't check that the first time I came in, they said they can only fix to the specifications given.  They said it could have been ANOTHER bad set of tires and road conditions messing up the alignment.  Tires should not have wire showing after only 5,000 miles.

Not only did the folks at Lithia help me get out of my high mileage Buick without writing a big check or over pricing my 2014 Jeep (when my husband said I couldn't do it), but they negotiated a better finance rate with my credit union than the one I had received earlier that day on my own. I told them what I needed, what I was willing to pay and Chuck and Liz worked with me until they offered me a deal I couldn't refuse. My daddy was a car salesman. I know when to grab the keys and drive away happy. I've bought many new cars over the years and my experience at Lithia was superlative from start to finish. Great service. Great people. And, I love my Jeep. ",5.0
1046,"September 18, 2013","Drove 1 1/2 hours from Houston to see a car that I had wanted for awhile. Fernando Gonzales was my salesman and could not ask for one better. Came back to purchase a car that I couldn't drive, a standard not because of the price, but the professionalism of the dealership.Had to take in for warranty service and they did a great job. Only thing accidentally forgotten was to fix water pump and they are now fixing it even though 60 day warranty period is up. Thank you Tim Caffey, Jody Weichert, and Ron Broesche for going above and beyond to get it taken care of. I was less than nice to Jody and greatly regret it. Will be back for my daughter a car this December. Will also recommend them to anyone looking for a vehicle, worth the drive, even with all the dealerships here in Houston.",5.0

1049,"May 30, 2013","Could not have been more pleased with our experience at Lithia. Will was very polite, helpful, and really listened. He also answered all my endless questions. We knew what we wanted when we got there and Will went above and beyond to help us get it. He asked Larry to search for our Journey because there was not one like we wanted at the dealership. One was found in Austin! The car was here the next day. Will called to let us know and was very patient and helpful with setting up my phone to Uconnect and showing me how to use all the extras, when I got there to pick it up. Chris was great in Finance too. Thank you Will and Lithia CJD!!",5.0
1050,"March 28, 2013",Will was very patient with me  Opened up the Laramie at least 20 times for me to look at before I ordered one.  Both Will and Jasmine are great Sales reps for Lithia  not once did I feel pressured.  This is my second vehicle to buy at Lithia after 30 years of buying out of town because of price.  I got a great product for a great price.  Thanks also to Larry ,5.0
1051,"March 17, 2013","My husband and I worked with Will. We went to look at the Dodge Dart which wasn't the car for us at all. Instead of telling us ""Well that's all we've got"" Will talked with us about what we wanted in a car and the price range we were wanting. We took a look at the Chryslers and fell in love with a 200. Will and their whole team worked to get us into it. We got an AMAZING deal and had great customer service. I boycotted Lithia since 2006, and I'm so glad they were able to change my mind about their dealership. They are a great dealership who will try their hardest to get you into the car that you want and talk to the banks to get their financing. DEFINITELY will buy my next vehicle from them :)",5.0
1052,"March 17, 2013","My family recently purchased a new Dodge Caravan from Lithia. We had a wonderful experience there. Jasmine was awesome. She didn’t just sell us a vehicle…she spent time with us, got to know us, and was genuinely interested in our needs. The whole staff at Lithia went above and beyond to make sure we were very happy with our purchase. They definitely established a positive relationship with us. We can’t wait to send them more business, especially Jasmine!",5.0

1055,"September 30, 2012",Only reason I gave customer service a 4 and not 5 is because when I called I didn't get the sales guy I was requesting. I had to leave a message with the receptionist. My call was returned within 30 minutes. This place is busy and was no issue. Overall the dealership is very friendly and does not pressure you to buy. They worked with me on my sub prime credit and got me approved for what I wanted. Thanks Lithia!,4.5
