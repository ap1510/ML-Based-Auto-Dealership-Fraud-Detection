7,"October 04, 2019","What's classic in Classic Chevy is nothing except Lemon Cars and poor quality of service. I would like to highly warn y’all before you will make mistake like I did. I bought pre-owned car from classic chevy which from very beginning had some hidden issues. First one was my mistake because during the test drive due to bad light I didn't notice damaged (cracking) cover by some cheap nail polish on back bumper. Of course, sales didn't say anything about it and later they looked so surprised about it. I'm not surprised about this behave but just after first turn I get starting hearing strange noise coming from steering column. My fun with them has been started. Just after checked it at Hyundai and Firestone I go back to them and complained. They promised to check it and fix it based on what I had from Hyundai inspection. In short, I had a luck to meet with them every week for two months. During first two visit I got that's nothing wrong with my car except fact that while you driving some crazy Thore is knocking by the Hamer to your steering column, but this was ok according their service. Every car on the glob does this.  I didn't give up and after 4th meeting they finally took care about it by sending my car from their best ever service to Christian brothers workshop. Wow, that was never happen that authorized service don't know how to fix car... Ok when car got back from Chris bro guess what happened - during handover I noted that my windshield is damaged. Of course Chevy service started that for sure it didn't happen here and it's not a safety concern that over a half of windshield it’s cracked etc etp.. I sent claim to service manager and they took care about it. In meanwhile, again, root causes of whole story about start knocking at every turn over and over. So, after next couple of service visits finally they passed car over to Hyundai. You know what's happened? They told Hyundai that customer is complaining about some clicking and for a week Chevy was unable to get from Hyundai what's happen to my car. This comes to point that I picked up a phone and call to Hyundai where I got information that basis on problem description from classic chevy they are unable to diagnose it. So again I'd to go there and present what classic chevy was unable to re-create.. To make story short: Hyundai found root causes but because this was not a safety concern classic chevy refused to take care about it, beside the fact that their pre-owned cars manager promised to fix this. Never ever again classic chevy and their quality! Classic Chevy, please safe my time and your time with comments like: If you are unsatisfied from our service please contact with Adam/John whoever works to raise your problem. Sorry, your management tricked me once time and that was their last time.",1.6

9,"August 04, 2019","BUYER BEWARE!! Deal cautiously with the Internet Sales Department and with Internet Sales Director Eric Hall. After confronting Eric Hall with several documented lies made by his staff during the negotiation of a sale, Eric Hall took no interest or action to correct. The customer service and treatment by this team before and after their dishonesty was exposed caused me to terminate negotiations and purchase my vehicle elsewhere. Based on this experience, I acquired a complete lack of trust in this dealership and in the Chevrolet name. Three years ago, I purchased a new vehicle from this dealership and the experience was good. However, over the past year, as I have inquired about trading into a new vehicle, I have sensed an obvious change in customer treatment and a lowering of ethical standards. This was confirmed when I recently engaged in serious negotiations for the purchase of a new vehicle. I was absolutely amazed at the lack of integrity on the part of the Internet Sales staff and Director Eric Hall. I ultimately purchased a BMW from Autobahn in Fort Worth. The professionalism and quality of service that I received from Autobahn BMW was night and day in comparison to Classic Chevrolet’s Internet Sales Department. PLEASE before you purchase a vehicle from this dealership, especially the Internet Sales Department, make certain that you are not being lied to by Eric Hall and his team. If at all possible, visit another dealership (or maker) and compare the treatment. I assure you, if you take the time to do this, you will see that there claim of being the “best dealership in Texas” is just another swindle.",1.0
10,"June 10, 2019","I just had the best car-buying experience of my life!  My husband and I worked with Joni Aviles.  He was fantastic to work with.  We weren't planning to buy a Chevrolet - just went in to compare with what we WERE planning to buy.  Joni was well versed on his products, as well as the other products we were looking at.  He was very professional, no pressure at all.  We got a great car at a great price and the experience was actually positive - unlike other car-buying experiences in the past.

Thanks Joni!!!",5.0

Yes Ladies and Gentlemen, You too can be the  Winner of Classic Chevrolet's 2019 Customer retaliation event with the Grand Prize including never again being allowed to have your vehicle serviced at this location. 


To Enter,  you must schedule your Non-Employee Customer Evaluation with Joe Laubhan - Service Director.

*Contest rules*
1. Do not complain about the service done to your vehicle, even if there is an actual issue with your car/truck that has not yet been properly diagnosed after repeated attempts. That's what DTP is for after all. Warranties are just a formality and TSBs only apply to Fords right? 

2. Do not complain if your vehicle has been sitting at the dealership for 3-4 days without status update or get upset if you're informed after 3-4 days that the person you're going to pay to perform ""Non-Warranty"" work won't be available for 3 weeks.  You should rejoice anyone noticed your vehicle to begin with. 

3. Do not expect to get your vehicle ""Serviced"" at a service department nor expect service from a ""Service"" dept. It's 2019. Customers are annoying  and this will deduct points. 

4. Having an issue with your vehicle enters you into an agreement with Classic Chevrolet that you will be subject to Slanderous accusations by Classic Mgmt and invented content to be typed into a computer secretly at an undisclosed location. 

5. For official inquiry into these rules and a complimentary Non-Employee Customer performance evaluation, please contact Joe Laubhan - Service Director, if you're unable to reach him after repeated calls/attempts as this is just business as usual. 

6. Attempting to obtain status on your vehicle after 3-4 days will result in disqualification from the contest and a Ban from the dealership. *Pause Parody*  You will also get your rear view mirror cocked sideways signaling that you've been 86'd.  

**Resume Parody**

7. Speaking to Adam Kimber is a no no and Joe will perceive this as ""Going over his head"" or ""Getting someone involved"" even though you're just trying to get a hold of the chain of command. 

=====================*Disclaimer*=====================================

Classic Chevrolet reserves the right no matter the situation to inform their customers that ""No one wants to work with them"" and Managers will selectively filter Appointments and reject them without prior notice or explanation. In the absence of a Professional Letter/Email informing customer of said event, a verbal altercation initiated over the phone by a Classic Employee will be an alternative form of communication.

12,"February 25, 2019","I recently attempted to purchase a new truck from Classic in Grapevine.   I should have known better because I purchased 2 new cars from there in 2016 and both of those were problematic also ( The two previous salesmen have either been fired or retired since then).
In my latest adventure the salesman, Frank R., tried  three different ""bait and switch"" tactics:
1.  He tried to get me to leave the dealership with a truck that the next day he said was $3700 more 
     than the day before. 
2.  He then tried to ""fix"" his mistake by offering to price match another truck but the other truck had 
     a MSRP that was $3000 less than the first one.   There wasn't any price match.   It was just a 
     cheaper truck.
3.  Finally, after negotiating a replacement truck, he then writes up a purchase agreement using the 
     VIN for the first truck ($3700 more) not for the one with the lower MSRP (about a $6000 
    difference)
Do not trust them.  Totally unprofessional.   No due diligence.   Do not allow them to rush you through the paperwork.   Although I am brand loyal, I would not recommend Classic to anyone who wants to have an enjoyable non-problematic new car/truck buying experience.
I am very happy with the new truck that I purchased from another dealer.

13,"January 16, 2019","On 03/22/2018 We went in Classic Chevrolet in Grapevine TX to trade in my wife's car a previous classic purchase and purchase a new 2018 Malibu hybrid with a classic-general motors flyer-offers stating 0% for 72 months valid till 04/01/2018 and the only reason we were buying a new car ,
So after hours of normal dealership BS we get to finance office show them there own flyer-brochure that clearly stated 0% for 72 on new Malibu's and was flat out lied to by finance saying that offer wasn’t  valid . So they pulled our credit from 5 other lenders  . At this
point told wife we would call GM when we got home , Was tired and had spent 8 hours of my wife's day off there at that point.

When arriving home called General Motors and was told that indeed the 0% for 72 was valid and to return to dealership, Called classic back and we were
instructed to return to dealership and sign a new contract for the same 0% for 72 months they said wasn’t valid. We went in on wife's next day off and signed new contract for 0% for
72 threw GM finance as it should have been from the get go . No real apology for getting their hand caught in cookie jar . 1st contract had 7000.00 in finance charges and exactly why we were deceived-lied to ! Plain and simple THEFT

Fast forward a couple months and we find out both our credit reports have 5 hard pulls , contact dealership and that gets us no where so we opened a BBB case on them where they in fact admit guilt or what they called a mistake and I quote 
“I have talked to the Sales Director. I have been informed that it was a miscommunication between
sales and finance. We are currently working on getting the credit inquiries removed” 

I accept that and close case , Fast forward another 4 months and none have been removed .

I have been what I would call a good customer over the years
always giving great surveys even when they sent my wife to Denton at 4 a.m. with no oil cap after a oil change the previous day
and oil pouring on a hot turbo and check engine light. Even on the new car survey (and I regret that ) But been in car business my whole career and know the salesman would have got screwed out of his commission if I nailed finance on survey and this was in no way his fault . We paid full
msrp for car without haggling and I guess that wasn't good enough so lie and try to steal 7000k more in finance charges xxx . I have avoided putting this on blast up till now but with the lies and not doing what they said they would do I wont avoid it anymore . Best question why would the service manager be dealing with BBB complaints for finance sales ?
Also went to body shop to get a est to repaint rear bumper as wife had a small bobo and was quoted 3 times what 3 other bodys shops estimates and was
never contacted about that either. ",1.4
14,"August 18, 2018","Make sure you cover everything about your vehicle with your sales person, if you dont Classic will leave you high and dry. I bought a truck thinking is was just another Silverado but after the paper was signed I noticed on the tailgate it said efficiency series and I asked my sales man what that was and he said it is something new that I don't know about. So I left with the truck because of it being 9 o'clock having a baby with me and over a 2 hour drive home. Trying to get use to the truck shutting off at red lights and finding I didn't like it I took it to my local Chevrolet dealer to ask them to shut off the auto stop. They said they couldn't because that truck was built to California emissions laws. Plus I could not turn off the Hybrid part because the truck won't run without it. I asked Classic to help me get out of it and all they want to do is sale me another truck with more money down and higher payments. And don't try to contact the GM he will not return your calls. And don't get Ricky Moss for a salesman he will lie to your face. ",1.0
15,"March 22, 2017","If you don't mind the traditional negotiation for a pre-owned car, you can save money here! Not a ""pressure"" dealer, but you will need to do the ""back and forth"", and probably deal with both a courteous, no pressure sales person, and their boss, the manager. And don't assume the ""final"" deal is really final! after leaving to check out another car at a different dealer, the manager called with another $500 on my trade in. I ended up buying here and got what I consider a very good deal, based on competitive cars elsewhere. Again, traditional experience, value, and a low pressure environment. I like the negotiation, so I can recommend. If you want the ""one price/no haggle"" experience, you need to go elsewhere, but be ready to pay more. ",4.8
16,"December 27, 2016","The sales team at Classic Chevrolet at Grapevine strung me out for a month on a new Corvette Z06 then stretched the sales to over 11 hours, changing the deal at the last minute. I was so tired I took the deal stating that I would not want to see an ad in a week or two with the price that had been advertised.  The sales manager promised this would not happen. Within a week or so the ad came out as I feared with the price I expected. The sales manager claimed the ads were mistakes and would not be honored for any customers.  (In other words, they didn’t honor their ads for anyone.) Also, my salesman had talked on day one about a specific discount and when asked, he back peddled to cover his back. No honor here. Finally, the sales team lost the keys so I arrived at about 9 am and didn't leave till about 8 pm. I was worn out.

After receiving the car, I noted the roof was not properly latched and the passenger seat was water damaged. In replacing the seat cover the dealer damaged the passenger window tint. In redoing the tint, the dealer scratched the passenger A pillar which took two trips to fix. You be the judge.

Buy from Classic Chevrolet Grapevine at your own risk. They are nice and smile a lot and the facility is clean, but they have not acted honorably.

19,"November 26, 2015","I picked up my vehicle today (the day before thanksgiving) and several of the gentlemen stayed late to ensure I had my Yukon before our family's holiday commute out of town. I got 15 miles down the road and noticed there was something not right with the way my vehicle was driving... So I immediately pulled over (since I had precious cargo on board--- my three children in the backseat ). Thankfully the manager Kevin offered his personal cell number to me earlier in the day because my pick up time was going to be after business hours. He answered and offered to help me over the phone even though he had already left the shop for the holiday. I must've been a rambling mess because when I wasn't making any sense without hesitation he and the other manager Paul were close to the location that I pulled over to stop, came to help assist me. Being a female with 3 young children (and did I mention my husband works an hour and a half away)... they went above and beyond to help me! All to the embarrassing diagnosis that my Yukon was just in 4WD and that's why it was driving funky (this is my first 4WD vehicle-- please pardon my lack of experience here ) Regardless of the minor fix, they both were more than happy to go ABOVE AND BEYOND!!!! 1,000 thumbs up for this facility and the AMAZING managers Kevin and Paul that are so empathetic and professional!!!",5.0

25,"December 19, 2014","Summary:
There are two factors that really impacted the sale, the low offers, and the yelling employee calling my wife and I a waste of time, these factors contributed to providing CarMax, and Mazda a sale.  

Initial Process:
My wife and I recently took a stroll to Classic Chevrolet of Grapevine, we were interested in leasing, which we discovered they do not actually do.  At this time we entertained the possibility of buying the vehicle we had originally hoped to lease, as well as trading in two vehicles to utilize as a down payment.  We informed the sales associate, our decision to buy was based off the appraisal value of the two trade-ins. During the appraisal process, associates perform a one minute walk around the car, yes one minute, whereas Carmax performs a 20-minute inspection and test drives your vehicle as well as explain the concluding value. 

Yelling Employee:
During the appraisal process, another sales associate approached my wife and I, this associate had previously provided a test drive a few days prior.  This associate asked ""did you tell (name) that I was working with you?""  I explained to the employee that we were doing business with our current sales associate before the test drive, this associate then responded by yelling in front of several employees, ""then you should have told me so I didn't waste my time!"" and then proceeded to walk away. 

Trade In Appraisal:
At this point, it was either wait patiently to view the possible trade-in values or completely walk away as a result of this employee.  We waited; to no surprise we received low offers, offering us $2025 below clean trade-in value at NADA, and $3550 under clean trade-in value at NADA.   The following day we sold both vehicles to Carmax for incredibly much better appraisal offers, and then swiftly leased a Mazda CX-5 from Mazda.  ",1.0
26,"August 08, 2014","This is a story I wanted to share with all of my fellow North Texas Camaro 5 owners. It is meant to share my experiences with the dealer and I fully understand you may have had nothing but good experiences with them. Unfortunately that is not the case for me. I bought my car from Classic Chevrolet in Grapevine and have had my car serviced by them through my entire history.

Note that strike 1 and 2 were all because of sloppy service technician. The service consultant Yrenio Carrera did everything in his power to show what being the Mark of Excellence meant. On strike 3 neither the dealer nor Yrenio even bothered to apologize for their mistake.

Strike 1: Service technician putting a dent on my driver door panel
Around this time this year (Early July 2012) I took my car for emergency maintenance where I had to get my lifters and cam replaced. The service technician left a nice ding on my driver door when I picked it up. I took it back to dealer on July 22nd and they started the repair. I received word on 8/7 that car my ready so picked it up. No door ding anymore. Unfortunately on 8/20 when I was giving her a full detail I noticed a big scrape on the inside of my driver door as well as the trunk release button not working. They finally replied on 8/30 that they want me to bring the car back to fix the damage. Turns out the dent repair man drilled and scrapped the inside of my door as well as broke the inside of the panel while repairing the dent. On 9/6 they call me back and say she is ready. I go pick her up and immediately put her back in. They had given it to the dent person to repair and he did a horrendous job on the paint job. I don’t even want to call it a paint job because it was not matching or meshed together. Finally I go pick the car up 9/15 and find the steering wheel scratched. By the time they finally got the correct steering wheel it was 10/19. 

This strike is on the service technician because of the lack of attention and sloppiness from the service technician that added a dent. The service consultant Yrenio did everything in his power to do right on this mistake.

Strike 2: Service technician forgetting to check if he had the right fuse box
In late January of this year I went in because my seat warmer was not properly working. Turns out the issue was that the fuse contacts on the fuse box were worn out causing a loss of connection. Note they were able to diagnose this issue with my aftermarket Scocshe dash kit. After driving it a few days I noticed the AC is not blowing. You twist the knob and the fan was not turning on. I took it in on 2/7 and what was their response… Diagnostic lead us to the aftermarket controller to be at fault. We are unable to work on aftermarket products and you will be required to take back to origination of installation for repairs. I reply on 2/7 that it was not the Scosche kit as it was working fine and I had even attempted a 2nd HVAC that I had form Scosche and scratched that off my list but that I would agree to their terms and put my car back to stock. Note that this charge to turn the car back to stock and then reinstall the kit was incurred on me. Do you want to know what the problem was?.... Ineptitude. The fuse block that was replaced by my service technician did not have the pins in the backside for the blower fuse. This is something that the technician should have watched out for when he replaced the fuse box. You want to know how much they refunded me for the removal and add of the Scosche kit… $50 dollars for 2 hrs labor time. It was hard to get this money out of them and they were still holding that for whatever reason their tech tools diagnosed the communication issue but could not find any problems this time around. It’s funny that they say they charge 25$ an hour for labor when everyone else charges 90-100. My incurred cost was not $50 but 324$ for 3 hrs of labor and tax. I honestly think the $25 an hour rate is BS but I have no way to prove it. I tried to get them to quote me a separate job via email so I can see their hourly rate but they didn’t want to give me price. Note at this point they feel so humiliated by their mistakes that they ask that anytime I bring my car for warranty work that it must be stock. Ladies and gentleman you hear it here that Classic will automatic blame your aftermarket parts without doing proper diagnostics

Again this strike is on the service technician for not making his checks before saying he was done and for Classic to blame and undercut compensation for their mistake. The service consultant Yrenio did everything in his power to do right. Although I don’t believe the proper compensation was given the mark of good customer service was there because Yrenio apologized for the technician’s mistakes

Strike 3: Service technician not bothering to check my brake wear.
I had my car in the shop on May 29th for some warranty work for my door lock. After that was resolved I had them to service which was part of my pre paid service package. Everything seemed fine until a few weeks later. It’s about mid June and I start hearing allot of noise from my brakes. I email back and forth with the service consultant and avoids a very basic question which gets me upset. I ask “isn’t checking the brake wear part of your normal inspection when servicing the vehicle.” He keeps avoiding that question until the end and ever goes as far as telling me it was going to be a $59 diagnostic fee for them to check what should have been checked on May 29th. Finally on 6/20 he admits that the 21 pt inspection does include a visual brake inspection to the best of the technician’s abilities. He says: I have no further information to give you at this time without a brake inspection. Please e-mail me back if you would like to make an appointment. No apology for no visual inspection being made whatsoever and no empathy. At that point I said I’m done with this dealer and had my brakes done at Scotty’s automotive. They were mostly all worn out with the most on one of them at 20% so I do not understand how the Classic technician failed to visually inspect that the brakes were worn.
This 3rd strike is not only on the technician but on the service consultant and Classic as a whole. Shop and service managers Tim Brogan and Joe Laubhan were CC’d on the emails and all it could have taken from them was to say a simple I’m sorry. 

I requested a cancellation of my remaining service plan and today I got by $100 refund for the remaining 2 services and decided to share with you my entire story. I hope this story helps others in deciding where to have their Camaro serviced here in North Texas. I cannot in good conscious continue to recommend Classic Chevrolet. I did before when they apologized and showed empathy but not anymore. The mistakes by the service technician just kept piling up and the customer service just kept going down. Classic Chevrolet of Grapevine you are not my GM dealer of the year and you have not earned the mark of excellence that your consultants proudly wear.

It took me 3 weeks to get my car out of the total loss dept. DON""T LET THIS HAPPEN TO YOU!!

I took my car to Golden Triangle Body Shop. They are honest and incredible craftsmen!! They fixed me collector car to 'before accident' flawless!! I entered my car in a car show, the day after I brought it home & no one ever knew it was wrecked!! 

STAY AWAY FROM CLASSIC CHEVY OF GRAPEVINE!!

They are lying, cheating, insurance frauding scumbags!! My attorney told me the truth is NOT slander!! ",1.0
31,"July 04, 2010","After a long day of car shopping with salesmen trying to pressure us into a vehicle that we didn't want, it was so pleasant to meet the guys over at Classic Chevrolet. We met Don Griffin at the used lot, and he was a great salesman to work with. We told him what type of vehicle we wanted and our price range. He was very straightforward, honest, and it was very relaxing to work with him. Another thing that was great about car shopping at classic was the fact that the prices were on all the vehicles. Earlier that day, we were car shopping at a lot up the road, and it was like pulling teeth trying to get them to tell us the prices of the vehicles we were looking at. This made it very difficult to find the vehicle we were looking for. Also, getting all of the paperwork together to purchase the vehicle was very easy. The guys at the Classic Chevrolet used lot made us feel right at home while we were waiting to sign the documents. Mike Klepper from financing went the extra mile calling lenders to make sure we got our monthly payment to where we needed it to be. Over all, it was a great experience shopping at Classic Chevrolet. I would recommend buying a vehicle from these guys to anyone I know.",5.0

My congratulations to the salesperson Alex Rivera and the Finance Mgr Rusty Frey.Now I know why they have been #1 in the Country since 2006.

33,"August 27, 2009","When Classic Chevrolet say, “Relax and enjoy the difference” they mean it.  I would like to share my experiences with the folks at Classic Chevrolet.  My experiences at Classic started with a clear minded sales person, Brent Williams.  From Brent I had the pleasure of working with Roger Langley in their finance department.  Although, I really did not think I would need to stumble upon the service department, I did due to a flat tire I had on my way to work earlier this month.  I would like to take the time to share my exceptional experiences with Classic Chevrolet!

As stated above, Brent Williams was phenomenal in his approach to helping me select my vehicle.  He asked me several questions relating to my driving patterns and what I was looking for in a new vehicle.  He asked me what options were of importance to me.  Brent then went into his system and found me the right vehicle with the body style, color, and options that I wanted.  It was as if I had ordered it from the mfg but without the wait time.

From Brent I went into the Finance Office.  In the Finance Office, I met Roger Langley.  Roger’s professional demeanor and knowledge was very comforting.  His experience rendered a way to know what was best for me.  As Roger and I visited about the financing options I had available he suggested an extended service contract.  I felt it was in my best interest to go ahead and purchase the extended service contract.  But when Roger suggested the Tire Protection Plan I was hesitant.  However, after Roger explained to me the benefits of the plan, I said, “Sure.”   My experience with Brent and Roger was stellar. 

Now 8 months later, things are about to make me go WOW, this place IS different.   I was on my way to work earlier this month and had a flat tire.  The tire was ruined.  So, I call Roger.  Roger connects me to Tim Brogan, their Service Manager.  I share with Tim my situation.  Tim tells me to come up to the service department with a copy of the receipt for the tire I had to replace.  So, I come up to the service department with the receipt.  I speak with Lindsey their service cashier.  She proceeds to tell me that Tim and the service staff were in a quick meeting.  I did not have the time to wait.  So, Lindsey seeing that I was in a hurry, said I will copy it and make sure Tim gets it.  My thoughts were skeptical at first but she assured me it would be taken care of.  So, I leave the copy of the receipt with Lindsey.  I get a call from Tim later that day to let me know he is going to take care of it.  Just over a week later I receive a check for the amount of the tire.  WOW!!  This is excellent communication at all levels of this dealership, from Brent to Roger; from Roger to Tim; from Lindsey to Tim; from Tim back to me…  What a whole dealership experience!

My excellent experience in communication and customer service is a testament of the management staff at Classic Chevrolet; you have taken the entire automotive experience to a new level.  Thank you for making a difference.

Sincerely,
Mark B.

34,"July 19, 2006","To Whom this may concern,

Within the past six weeks I bought a New 2007 Tahoe from Dave Burgess in the Internet Department at Classic Chevrolet. The complete transaction was of the highest of quality. The Internet replys were quick and very informative. The pricing was very reasonable and Dave seemed to be looking for every way possible to find more discounts. When I got into the Finance office Roger Langley assisted and explained everything in a relaxed, non pushy, manner. We are so happy with our experience that we are planning on purchasing a vehicle, from Dave, for my husband at the end of the year. I have recommended the dealership and my salesperson several time since our purchase. Thanks Dave and Classic Chevrolet. We will be back.
