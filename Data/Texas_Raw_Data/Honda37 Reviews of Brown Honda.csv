0,"February 03, 2020","Walked in and was immediately greeted by the receptionist AND 3 salespeople. Ed offered us a drink while we looked at Accords. He was very knowledgeable. They offered us a great deal. We did our homework before we got there. Finance person was great. painless! We were shown how to get our oil changed and even thanked by the Sales Mgr, Mr Bookot? before we left. Best buying experience we have ever had!",5.0
1,"November 15, 2018","I bought a new 2015 Pilot from Brown Honda in March 2015. I took it in every 5000 miles to get the oil and filter changed, as the Notice Label on the windshield said to do. I had it in for service at 45,000 miles and just happen to talk to a customer in the waiting room about servicing my vehicle. He ask if I had had the 30,000 mile service done. I wasn't sure, so I asked the service representative. He said no, we don't show you had the 30, 000 mile service done. I told him I had relied on Brown Honda Service Dept. to tell me what service needed done whenever I brought it in for service and I asked him why the 30,000 mile service had not been done. He stated, ""we had a service manager that wasn't checking to see things were being done properely and there were a lot of vehicles that were not serviced when they should have been. He is no longer employed at Brown Honda."" So I have now retained another place to service my vehicle, as I just don't think I can trust Brown Honda to do the right thing.

2,"November 14, 2018",I've read some of the bad reviews here on Dealer Rater and honestly don't know how these people left with such a bad taste in their mouths. Everyone I came into contact with was courteous and went out of their way to insure my wife and I were cared for properly. I highly recommend Brown. ,5.0
3,"October 08, 2018","BEWARE!! Brown Honda will lie and use sneaky sales tactics to suck you in. They say one thing, then do another. All Brown cares about is ripping you off. No service after the sale. BUYER BEWARE
DO NOT SHOP HERE. DO NOT GET SERVICE HERE. THE WORST HONDA DEALER EVER. After my third vehicle purchase from them did not go well they basically said screw you after they got my money.",1.0
4,"December 22, 2017","Stopped by to check out the CR-V, older guy walked out and I knew he had “I have to make a sale” look. He did not really listen to anything my wife and I had to say and seemed like he had his “pitch” and stuck with it, made my wife feel like all she was neede for was to pick the color, needless to say we left and purchased a vehicle that same day from a completely different dealership even though they sell GMC right next door at BROWN GMC. ",1.2
5,"December 21, 2016","Sales people are not knowledgeable about stock or vehicles. Sales manager sent rude text messages, did not train or communicate with salesmen & was not helpful. I have bought several vehicles from this dealership & always had great service. The last couple of years the entire dealership has gone downhill. Service department is getting better but they obviously have major problems in their new car sales division. I bought my new vehicle elsewhere this year. I will not be buying another car here until they improve their customer service.  What a disappointment. ",1.0
6,"November 17, 2016",Trying to get sunroof replaced...It exploded and sounded like a gun went off in our car. NO other vehicle was on this road with us. Waiting to see how Honda responds even though my car is just out of waranty,3.8
7,"July 18, 2016","I would like to sing the praises of Honda, Brown Honda in Amarillo and, in particular, Paul Parrish for their exceptional customer service, professionalism and grace they extended to me and my family.  Because of some issues I was having with my 2010 Honda CRV Honda stepped up and did the right thing by getting me a rental vehicle while my car was getting fixed.    

On the day I turned my rental vehicle in I met with Paul Parrish in the Honda Service Department several times as he wanted to ensure I was thoroughly satisfied and that there were no issues with my vehicle.  Mr. Parrish was personable, professional and compassionate and I hope to pay forward the grace he as well as Brown Honda showed me.  Mahalo!!!

8,"April 16, 2016","I have been taking my honda into the service department at Brown Honda  since I purchased it, thinking that since it was the Honda dealership  ,I could trust the service  I received there.Evidently I was wrong  as I recently had to replace the power steering pump in my car because the power steering pump had a leak and the fluid in the reservoir was too low so the pump went out . I think if the service tech had actually checked all fluids as stated on receipts then he would have noticed the power steering fluid being LOW therefore I will NOT take my car back to Brown Honda  Nor will I recommend Brown Honda a to anyone. I spoke with a gentleman in the service dept .and also to Paul P. about  this issue and neither one seemed at all concerned  Thank you         Linda",1.0
9,"December 26, 2015","I had not purchased a new car in several years.  Joe Dia helped me find exactly the right car, in exactly the right color, at exactly the right price. Then when circumstances prevented me from getting to the dealership to pick up the car, Joe delivered it to me - 30 miles away!  Thanks Joe, love my new CR-V!",5.0
10,"December 08, 2015","Everyone that we dealt with was awesome, Kyle(management), Frank(finance department), and especially our salesperson Joe Dia. We have purchased several vehicles from Brown, but this was by far the best and easiest experience that we've had with them. ",5.0
11,"December 07, 2015",Joe Dia was great helping find a car like what I had totaled. He also has been great with helping me when my car needs repairs done using my extended warranty. The service department has done great with fixing my car as needed. I'm happy with my purchase and will purchase from him again. ,5.0
12,"December 05, 2015","Jim Dia found a car for me that no one else could find through any Honda dealer in Texas.  He put up with all my unique needs, including text message communication, difficult accessory add-ons, out of state location, then weekend delivery 500 miles to my front door.  Even though he's in Amarillo, and I'm in San Antonio, I'll still buy my next Honda from him.  Of course the product is excellent, it's a Honda, but his ability to make things smooth was awesome.  Thanks Jim.",5.0
13,"December 05, 2015","I had shopped all over the state for a Pilot, I had better quotes, but Joe and his staff worked hard to get my business. They listened and understood my needs for a vehicle. Thank you.",4.6
14,"November 25, 2015",We have purchased two vehicles at this dealership and the experience was excellent in both cases.  Our most recent purchase was a Honda Ridgeline; Joe Dia did a great job.,5.0

19,"November 13, 2015","My Dealer's name is Thai and he was very straightforward in showing me the car that I want in my budget. As soon as I chose the car that I wanted, he quickly made it he's priority to get everything done for me, as in documents and numbers. By the time I was ready to sign the documents, the car had gone through inspections and had be detailed. Very quick and hassle-free.",4.8

21,"November 01, 2015","Andi made my car buying experience pleasurable instead of scary and stressful. Told her I wanted Honda Fit, and she never tried to get me to buy a more expensive car.  She listened to me, and respected my wishes.  She made me feel important, and that she was there to help me with my all my car buying needs.  She is also very knowledgeable and professional.  ",5.0
22,"October 31, 2015","Called Jim on Friday afternoon, he was willing to deal over the phone! When I arrived on Saturday, the vehicle was cleaned up and ready to go. 30 minutes or less on credit and finance paperwork. A good experience.",5.0
23,"October 24, 2015","We have worked with Thai and Taylor before, and they are both friendly and professional. We would certainly deal with them again in the future.",5.0
24,"October 23, 2015","I have dealt with this Honda dealership since 1990 and have purchased several vehicles from Jim Dia. When I walk in the door I have always been treated fabulous.  I walk in the front door and am greeted with a smile and a hug from Chelsea and then I always get hugs from Jim, Bryan and Deana.  I have always been treated more like family.   You cannot get better customer service anywhere.  I would say they are all people persons.  My purchases are always my choice and I have never been pushed to make a decision in anyway.  I truly feel like they are family to me and the dealership also has a great Service Department.",5.0
25,"October 23, 2015","Andi was great! No pressure, No hassle. In and out of there. I told her what I needed and wanted. She was great. Thank you! ",5.0
26,"October 20, 2015","The salesman was very professional, with no pressure when I was at the dealership to look at different vehicles.  He was very patient with me while I was test driving one type vehicle, only to change my mind and decide on another.  The Honda Pilot, Touring was my vehicle of choice, which had to be ordered.  I picked it up today, and love it.  Brown Honda in Amarillo is an excellent dealership, as this was my fifth vehicle purchased from the Brown dealership family.",5.0
27,"October 20, 2015",Andi Middleton made the whole process of buying my car a pleasant experience. She brought me different cars to try until I found exactly what I wanted.

29,"October 19, 2015","I had the pleasure of dealing with Joe Dia my first time buying a new car. He went out of his way to get me exactly what I wanted, and now I'm in the Civic I've always dreamed of having at a more reasonable price than I ever expected! I would highly recommend Joe or Jim to anyone looking to get into a dependable, efficient vehicle, whether it be new or used. I'll definitely be going back to these guys at Brown Honda for my next car!",5.0

32,"October 19, 2015",Joe was very professional & helpful! I really feel like he worked to get us the best deal possible! We will definitely work with him again. Highly recommend! ,5.0
33,"October 17, 2015",I had a great experience buying a car here.  I bought a 2015 Honda Civic from Jim Dia.  This is the second car I have bought from him.  He knows the cars he is selling and makes the whole process easy.  Everyone there was very helpful.  I told him what I wanted.  I went in and signed papers and drove away,5.0
34,"March 12, 2012","On 3/3 I test drove a used Honda 2011 Civic with Teddy Peacock. The car smelled like it has been sprayed with Ozium to mask a cigarette smell. He said that no one had smoked in the car. The brakes also felt a bit loose, but I wanted to give the car the benefit of the doubt. I traded my 08 Civic Honda for the 2011. The next day, 3/4 I noticed the brakes were worse and called Teddy. He said the rotors had been serviced and would be okay in a couple of days. He said the record would be attached to the car fax. There was no record. I also told him that the car did smell of smoke and he claimed to know nothing about it. On 3/5 I called him and told him I wanted my money and my trade-in back because the car stunk and the brakes were bad. He told me I couldn't get my car back and that I should call Terry Bookout, because he would ""make it right."" I also emailed him this request as well as Deana Riley who said I could bring the car back within 3 days of purchase if there was a problem. On 3/6 I took the vehicle to Garcia Honda in Albuquerque, where I live, because I was very concerned about the brakes and wondering what else what misrepresented to me about the vehicle. The Honda techs said that the brakes needed machining! The odometer showed only 16,000+ miles when I purchased it! I called Bookout who said I couldn't get my car back even though Deana Riley said on 3/3 that I had 3 days from the time of purchase to return the car. When I called again on 3/6, Bryan Vosler said that it wasn't unusual to have the brakes changed at 16,000 as he had has his changed at 13,000. I didn't even respond, because I have never heard such an egregious claim. I again requested my vehicle back and was told it had been sold. They made no effort to refund my money or offer me a replacement vehicle. Garcia Honda has even had a hard time getting Southwest to pick up the tab for the labor on the rotors.
The 2011 Honda Civic was supposedly put through a rigorous 150 point inspection by certified dealers, and obviously it wasn't completed. They even tried to get me to spend an additional $395 on an extended warranty when it's obvious they didn't take care and inspect the vehicle appropriately in the first place. Now, I'm stuck with a vehicle that was misrepresented to me, and who knows what else was omitted during their inspection. They got a great trade in my Honda Civic 08 and God only knows what else is wrong with the car that they sold me. BEWARE!",1.4
35,"December 13, 2011","Let me say first that I'm a longtime customer of the Brown family of dealerships, as is my entire family. Have been for years. As for Southwest Honda, if I could give this place less than one star, I would. I bought a used vehicle and it was represented to me that all the safety checks on the car had been done and that it was in good condition and safe. After I drove it home, I realized that if you were on a rough road, it almost felt like the wheels were going to fall off. I took it back and had them look it over in the service department. My car sat there all day. When I called to check on it, I was told that everyone in the service department had driven it (burning a 1/4 tank of my gas) and that it was fine and that they had done nothing to it and they were not going to, I could come get it. The service manager was a jerk about giving me a car to drive while they had it and also was condescending about my complaints about the car. He basically treated me like I was an idiot. After taking it to a tire shop and another dealership that specialized in the make of the car, I found out that the car had a set of mismatched tires (different treads) and that they are so worn that they are unsafe. Honda refuses to replace the tires. There is no way they could have missed the shape these tires were in...they were just too cheap to replace them before they put it on the lot. It might cut into their profit. They also have neglected to give me the extra key I was promised when I bought the car. The car also needed maintenance that they never did and now I'm stuck having to pay for it because they represented to me that all the maintenance had been done. I have spent hours on the phone arguing with people who have been nothing but first class jerks, the service manager being the biggest one. If you shop at Southwest Honda, you will get a smile and a friendly face until you give them your money. Once they have that, you will be treated horrendously. All I have been given is the run-around. These people know absolutely nothing about customer service. Take your business somewhere else. If you buy from these guys, you'll be sorry.

36,"November 11, 2010","     I had a great experiance shopping for, and purchasing, a new 2010 Honda Civic at SW Honda! 
     Mr. Josh Case determined just exactly what my needs, concerns and wants were, then he didn't rest untill he found a way for SW Honda to meet them. He consulted with Mike Lemmons and invited his ideas and i felt that they both were concerned with understanding and meeting my needs. They took my purchasing problems/issues and made them their own. They were open and made me feel our negotiations were always safe.
     Desiree's smile and demeanor is so nice..., and always welcoming. Her presence was a pleasure. 
     Denna, quickly go to know me and my particular personal circumstances, as they related to my financing needs. I felt like i could trust her as she educated me about of all the details I would need to know about financing a car with American Honda Financial.
     I'm a satisfied repeat customer from 2 previous purchases over the last 15 years. 2010 was the best yet! The personel are what makes it so great for me.

Thanks,
