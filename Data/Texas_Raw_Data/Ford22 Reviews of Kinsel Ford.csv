0,"December 05, 2019","Its bad when you bring your truck in for a Recall that you are having problems with and they do the wrong Recall and your still having problems with it. You bring it back to them with the same recall paper you showed them the first time and tell them they didn't do the right recall because its not the code they read.  They said I needed to make a appointment for that and I said my first appointment never ended because they didn't fix in the first time in. They said it doesn't work that way... I said I know because you didn't do the work in the first place.  That's when they got very rude..... very rude...
Beware if you need something fix by that department.....",1.0
1,"September 24, 2019","My husband & I have tentatively been in the market for him a new vehicle. We live in the area, but typically buy our vehicles in other places due to better pricing. We happened to be driving by Kinsel & saw a vehicle of interest. We dropped in & a salesperson met us outside while we were browsing. Test drove the vehicle & decided to work a deal. The trade came in low, but we knew that would be a challenge and were prepared to put money down. They did not come off of their MSRP any at all. During the negotiation stage & their low number on trade it seemed in a way they really were not trying to work with us. Credit and income were not an issue. We put together a deal (that we have since found a WAY better one), were told an interest rate (which was WAYYYYYY high) and a monthly payment. We were looked in the face and told that they ran our credit through Ford Credit and these were the terms. We agreed to the deal and planned to refinance with our CU in a few months. We wanted to initially finance with Ford for the rebates because it helped with the negative equity on the trade. Our salesperson then came to us and said that he did not want to keep us waiting and he would call us when he had it all finalized. NO CALL. Called back later that afternoon and was told they were really busy (literally no one in there when we were earlier) & would get it finalized on Monday. This all took place on Saturday. No Call on Monday. We found a better deal at another dealership about an hour away. Called them & informed them of the ""deal"" we had attempted with Kinsel & that ford credit should have our application & credit information. Once we arrived to work a deal on a truck that had many many more options for 8K less than the kinsel vehicle we were informed that they had never even submitted our application to Ford. They submitted it to our credit union instead after we told them ONLY to submit it to Ford. So basically they lied to our faces and never even submitted the deal to ford like they claimed. So I have no idea how they gave us an interest rate and a note. They told us they would call when it was all finalized & we NEVER heard from them again!! Will never attempt to do business with them and have gladly told our friends and family to take their business elsewhere. Extremely unprofessional. So glad we took our business to another dealership where we got a way better deal on a nicer vehicle. ",1.0

3,"April 25, 2019","UNLESS YOU MUST USE THEM FOR A WARRANTY ISSUE, find another place for car service and maintenance. I have lost all confidence in Kinsel Ford Beaumont as a car service provider.

I have always brought my SUV here for service and regular maintenance since I bought it new from this location. I've now we've hit 100K miles and one week ago, I brought it in for oil change and a solid check up to make sure things were holding up. It has been driving really rough and getting worse so I was concerned. I was met the routine ""what are you here for today"" and paperwork. I had a call that the car was ready so after the oil change, I got a ride from a coworker to pick up the vehicle.  It had been a few hours since the call so I thought I'd be in and out. 

Unfortunately, I was wrong and they had actually lost my key. It took 30+mins of me sitting patiently waiting while I saw lots of ""walking around"" and heard zero status updates since, ""we'll pull it around for you out there.""  When I finally asked why it was taking so long, I was told my key couldn't be found. I really needed to get back to work and I had my spare so I asked for my car so I could go. Again -- zero communication on how / what happens if its lost / what about replacement / nothing.  
I returned on a Saturday morning to check and see if my key had been located and thankfully it had been. It was in a tool box. Mistakes like this aren't a big deal. What is irritating is that there was no communication. No updates. No phone call. I just happened to drop by and it was found.  It's frustrating but this isn't the biggest complaint. 

Huge issue: the service I requested - please check my car to make sure things are all good - totally didn't happen or it's a total crap job. Nothing was said to me about any issues. They did not tell me anything except a recommendation to change an air filter $$. I did get an emailed report sent, saying they performed the ""full car"" inspection and everything was normal. (Except air filter). 

However it has been driving super rough and it really was getting worse over the weekend. I mentioned it to my boyfriend and thanks to Youtube and Google, we actually discovered that the engine mounts were broken. As untrained, not mechanics people, we found the problem. So, the next morning, I brought it back to Kinsel to ask why it wasn't caught with the ""inspection"" and that it needed immediate attention. 

I was met with complete lack of concern and simple reply that ""they need $196 to diagnose the problem, and we're not sure when we can get to it."" It needed to go to the other shop (somewhere?) and that if I didn't want the repairs done, I'd just pay the $196 diag. fee.  So, I decided to leave and find another place. 

AAMCO Beaumont diagnosed it for me for $60 which is being credited towards the repair cost. It turns out that all the mounts were totally broken except one. ONE bolt was holding the engine in the place and it was failing. Turns out the amount of movement from the engine also damaged my transmission. So the repair is a little more extensive. It still will be costly, but at least I feel like its actually getting resolved by  professionals that actually seemed to be concerned about me, my business and that I have a safe car to drive. 

I have lost all confidence in Kinsel Ford Beaumont as a car service provider. I consider any claim of  ""trained Ford professionals"" to be totally false. Just seven days prior to this, I had just brought my car in for service and asked for a complete check up. They totally failed. UNLESS YOU MUST USE THEM FOR A WARRANTY ISSUE,  find another place for car service and maintenance.",1.4
4,"February 12, 2019","Since we purchased this car we have had problems with this car shuddering and not wanting to change gears. The transmission has had a problem for years but they always tell me nothing can be done with it do to the fact that Ford put a different kind of transmission in those cars. They told me it will be OK and nothing would go wrong with my car. WELL WELL MY CAR WONT COME OUT OF HIGH GEAR>>>>> and KINSEL FORD IN BEAUMONT WILL NOT STAND BY THERE CAR THEY SOLD TO ME.
I WAS TOLD THAT THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO ABOUT IT AND BLAMED THE FORD COMPANY. THIS CAR WAITS UNTIL THE WARRANTY GOES OUT=..
I am not going to pay a dime on this car at all. They will fix it and I will get another car a soon as possible. the 75 year old man at the service department told my husband today that there is nothing that he can do about it. WHAT I SPEAK THE NAME OF JESUS OVER THIS PLACE AND PRAY THAT NO CAR GETS SOLD UNTIL MY I GET A NEW CAR....... ",1.0
5,"November 01, 2018",My son is going to school at Lamar University in Beaumont and recently his Ford Focus wouldn't go into gear. I was in Houston and wasn't there to help. I spoke with Eddie in the service department at Kinsel Ford and he was able to get a tow truck to my son to help. They found the Campus police had jumped the care incorrectly and that was the reason the transmission wouldn't go into gear. The tow company helped my son get his car back on the road. Eddie wen above and beyond what he needed to do to help my son & I. Thank You Eddie!!. How can you go wrong dealing with Kinsel Ford with people like Eddie helping you. Way to go!!!!,5.0

8,"August 21, 2018",I bought a new explorer from them for my wife and within a week all 4 tire sensors were out along with many other problems. They told me it would be 3 months before they could get it in to fix the problem... 3 MONTHS are you kidding me???? So I brought it to another ford dealership who got it in right away and they also let me know the tire alignment was so bad that the car should have never left the dealership (we got it delivered we didn't test drive it. It was also delivered with 15 miles to empty to top things off). I will not be doing business here ever again. Terrible experience.,1.6

Couldn't ask for a better deal, Johnny also got me alot more on trade than what I was expecting. Great service, no pressure sales, in and out quick, and held the truck that I was wanting.

19,"October 11, 2015",I just want to say how happy we were with our experience at Kinsel.  We purchased a 2010 Buick Enclave.  Our sales rep showed us several different cars right before closing.  Never felt rushed or pressured.  Once we made the decision to buy we were handled in a very professional manor.  The vehicle had a minor problem that needed service so we left the vehicle overnight and returned to pick it up the next day.  When we came back not only was the problem fixed but out rep decided to replace the battery also.  Thank You Keith Barlow for your great service.,5.0
20,"September 20, 2015",I purchased a 2005 Jeep from Bob Kuether & a 2012 Fusion from Johnny Bourgeois - both were a genuine gentleman; no pressure sell or bothered that I had a rambunctious child with me. The service department could really take some tips from these guys. ,4.2
21,"February 22, 2015","I found a truck advertised on AutoTrader that appeared to be a good price and made arrangements with the pre-owned vehicle department of Kinsel Ford to come and see the vehicle. Since I live in Southeast Houston, I called ahead of time when I left, and told them it would take about an hour and a half for me to arrive, and they said to come out. While driving to the dealership, I spoke with the salesman, who warned me against speeding, and assured me that he had the paperwork on the extended warranty that I had asked about. He also gave me his mobile phone number so that I could find my way to the dealership (just in case). When I was literally two miles away from the dealership, I called the salesman one more time, just to confirm that my GPS was leading me in the right direction, and at that point, he noted that someone was interested in the vehicle. When I arrived at the dealership less than five minutes later, the salesman met me out front, pulled the truck out for me to take a look, and then went inside. When he came back out, he asked how flexible I was on color, as the people who had just dropped by the dealership to look at another vehicle, were processing the paperwork to purchase the truck I had driven 80 miles (each way) to see. The salesman tried to sell me another vehicle, but I was not interested and was (in my mind, justifiably) irritated. It felt like the typical deal whereby used car salespeople just want to make the sale, and can get the next sucker to take whatever is on the lot. The salesperson did not apologize, and only said that he wished he had ""hidden"" the truck in the back in hopes that no one would see it before I arrived. He also told me that I should have been told that the truck could be sold anytime prior to my arrive (again, despite the fact that I was driving so far to look at the vehicle). After my bad experience, I was contacted by the pre-owned sales manager, who I then informed of my displeasure. He wrote me back and apologized, said it was not the dealership's policy  to sell vehicles out from under potential customers who had an appointment, and offered to sell a similar vehicle (which had a higher sticker price) at a lower price and even offered to have someone drive the vehicle to Houston for my consideration. I am not sure if he knew it or not, but the vehicle he offered me was the vehicle the salesman had already tried to sell to me, but it was not the color I was interested in. If he knew this, then his offer was obviously hollow, but if he did not, then his offer was as good an offer that he could be expected to make, given the situation. Only he can know, but at the end of the day, the salespeople obviously were not aware of any policy to not sell vehicles out from under customers who have an appointment, and my time and money was wasted (I took a day off from work in addition to the gas for the trip).
