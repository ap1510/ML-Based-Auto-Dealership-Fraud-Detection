0,"June 26, 2020","I took my 2018 F150 for warranty work for the power tailgate and a cracked spray in bedliner. The tailgate was properly repaired but the service department was insistent that Ford did not offer sprayed in bedliners from the factory. It is on my window sticker. Ford.com not only shows the Ford Toughbed as an option, there is a description of it. I did not purchase the truck here, but I have bought vehicles at Rockwall Ford. My understanding when I purchased the truck was that warranty work was performed at all Ford dealerships.",3.0

4,"May 29, 2020","Very friendly and helpful service department personnel. My services visor Jackie, she is very knowledgeable and very helpful. Jessie the young man that picks up the cars and bring them to you. He’s very friendly and courteous.
The only negative is that they may need to have somebody there to take cash. Sometimes there are people that don’t carry credit cards or debit cards with them and they only use cash.
Lucky, that I had my debit card with me at that time.  That is the only reason that I can not give a “5” Star rating at this time. I was surprised that they did not take cash anymore.  
That’s the only negative of my experience.
I would recommend the service department to my Friends.  As far as buying a new vehicle from them I was not there to buy a new vehicle. I was there to have my vehicle serviced.",4.0

After that experience it was a no brainier to try again. I contacted multiple dealerships in the DFW area. ROCKWALL Ford wAs by far the most responsive and seemed to go the extra mile to keep my business. Excellent trade in valve on my 2009 F150 and no haggling, I told 5hem what I wanted and what I expected and my expectations were exceeded. Very happy with the whole process and highly recommend this dealership.",5.0

14,"May 04, 2020","This was our very first experience with Rockwall Ford.
We purchased a new F150 XLT last week, April 27th. 
Right at the beginning of the sales process, we told our salesperson Matthew Hubbs and his Sales Manager Rob, that we didn't want to spend all day there.
We told them that we wanted our trade appraisal completed and wanted to test drive a couple different version of the F-Series pickups.
Matthew and his sales manager Rob did EXACTLY WHAT WE ASKED!  

If you want to do business the way YOU WANT TO DO BUSINESS,
and, 
if you want to work with people that treat you like you are their FRIENDS AND FAMILY, then
GO TO ROCKWALL FORD.!!!!


This is a great place.... Love these people.

16,"May 03, 2020","Dealership doesn't stay true to deal, adds on extra hidden fees then disrespects buyer!

Be aware of VIT- vehicle inventory tax. Now the name alone makes you wonder why you would have to pay for ""inventory"" tax as the buyer, well you shouldn't.  Its a tax that they are trying to get the consumer to pay for when in reality it isnt a tax that should be paid on the buyers end. Do your research!! When you make a deal for price of vehicle plus tax, license, and doc fee and end up with other misc fees.

Also, a certification isn't $1495 for a certified used vehicle. Pay attention people!! They are a scam and disrespectful. The salesman, Zoltan, will inform you; ""you can afford it, you just don't want to pay"". All they care about is money, trying to suck every penny out of you and making you believe its a good deal.",1.0

20,"April 14, 2020","I was comparing pricing for basically the same F150 at two different dealerships.   The other dealer was your typical high pressure sales tactics which I have no patience for.    I contacted Rockwall and got a much better trade-in offer sight unseen on my old F150.

34,"March 14, 2020","I've tried several times and given them many opportunities but my experiences at Rockwall Ford are almost always a disappointment.  The vibe I get is that I need them more than they need me so I'll either accept what they say or they are happy to let me walk away.  No emphasis on customer support and I'm always treated as if I don't have a clue so whatever they say should be accepted as gospel.  Some of the stuff I've seen and heard there defies explanation.  I feel sorry for those that do not know better that have been taken advantage of.

I was sent an email to leave this feed back and to call a number if it's not 5-star.  Typical Rockwall Ford, it's been busy for hours.  I wanted to give them an opportunity to hear what I had to say but I think they really just don't care.",2.4
35,"March 10, 2020","My 2019 Ram had a defective passenger side fender, and since it was a warranty issue, Rockwall CDJR sent me to Rockwall Fords body shop to handle. When I walked in CDJR, I was not greeted and it seemed like nobody wanted to help. I finally asked if they were open(it was 5pm), and Meagan Stepped up to help. I told her about the issue, and she jumped right on it. She took pics, explained the process then sent the pics over, but never followed up with an answer from Ram. I called back a week later, still nothing. Finally after 2-1/2 to 3 weeks, the pics were approved. I got my truck in and they set me up with a rental. I only called once a week for an update, and sadly, I had to initiate most calls, and they couldn’t tell me much when we spoke. I finally got smart and called the body shop direct and that’s when I started working with Shelby. She started off strong, and I felt good about how things were going, but there were a couple of set backs, which I was more than understanding about, but during those set backs, she stopped calling me with updates. They finally got the fender replaced, and it looked great. They did forget to put the pinstripes back on the passenger door and fender, as well as the badges, which I pointed out immediately. I was told I could bring the truck back before 5 on any week day and they would take care of it. I went back the following day, and even called ahead, but all they could do is put the badges back on, due to the cold wet weather. Shelby told me she would give my info to their pinstripe guy and he would come to me and put the stripes on. Well, he didn’t call for 2+ weeks, so I called Shelby. She apologized and said she’d reach out to him. About 3-4 days later, he called to let me know he’d get me scheduled as soon as the weather warmed up. To this date, he has never called me back to schedule, so I just took them off of my entire truck. The part I’m most disappointed in is next. On my way home from the shop on Jan 20th, which was the first day I got it back, I stopped to fuel up. While I was fueling up, I was admiring the great work on the fender, but I noticed a scratch on my passenger mirror, and 2 very small gouges on my hood, right above the newly replaced fender. I immediately called Shelby to inform her, and she instantly said they didn’t do it and it was a rock chip, I politely disagreed and asked her to look into it the following day when I was going to be at the shop. When I was at the shop the following day, I pointed it out, and she continued saying it was a rock chip. I was very nice about it and told her whatever it was, it wasn’t there when I turned the truck over to Rockwall CDJR. She offered to get with Courtney, who took over with helping me, to see if he had pics. When I called to ask for an update, she said she hadn’t been able to speak with Courtney, but would keep trying. Another week passed and I hadn’t heard anything, so I called Courtney and got the pics myself. They were not broad enough pics, and only showed the defective fender, so I asked him if I could get the other pics, and who I needed to speak with, I never heard back from him. I called back later that week and spoke with JB(?), who was awesome, and he got with Meagan who had pics of my truck from the initial report, which clearly shows there was no damage when I turned the truck in. I called Shelby to inform her. She was very hesitant to offer to look at them. I obtained her email, emailed the pics, highlighting where the damage was and was not, and still haven't heard back from her, and that’s been 3+ weeks. I even emailed her again to ask if she had a chance to review... and haven't received a response. Sorry for the book, but this service was ridiculous! The gouges are very minor, and I could probably live with them, but this is now about the principle of the matter. I don’t know where to go if this essay falls on deaf ears, but I’m ready to do so if necessary. It’s comical how small these gouges are, and that I was in a rental from Dec 10 to Jan 20, but it’s also comical to know this is how you treat your customers. ",1.0

I had been looking for a used vehicle on-line for about 4 months and the Rockwall Ford listing on CarsGuru caught my eye for several reasons. It had many great pictures of the vehicle, inside and outside, close up and away. The description was very, very detailed and accurate. I really felt like I knew about Rockwall Ford, the Ford vehicle, financing and with the assistance of my on-line representative, Norma arranging and re-arranging [friendly and timely communications] the same day appointment with times to meet my schedule and with the greatest car sales representative ever, Zoltan Bango showing me the Expedition in a no nonsense, no pressure manner and Adnan with a financing package just for me.  I felt totally confident I was making the correct decision for myself and my family. We drove from Granbury to Rockwall Ford which was 2.5 hrs away. Totally worth it! From Rossanne & Carson Day
P.S. We found out Zoltan and I had crossed paths at an event in Dallas Texas 3 weeks earlier that had 50,000 attendees and did not know each other or that he even sold cars.  Here we were again I am buying my dream car from him.  Small, small world. Meant to be. ",5.0

This concerned me since I have had service there before and I have paid for all Maintenance and bumper to bumper coverage for 100K. I called at 1:30pm to inquire if my vehicle was ready for pickup.(5hrs later mind you) Elizabeth informed me that they got busy with other work in the shop and they will TRY to have my vehicle done by close of business.(I believe they close at 5:30pm) I informed Elizabeth that was not acceptable as I had to be in Dallas by 6pm. She said she would check to see if she can make this happen. She called about an hour later to inform me that my truck will be ready shortly. She also informed me that they are unable to weld the exhaust bracket that had sheared off of my 2016 Ford F-150. She said that they or I  can take it to a muffler shop to have it welded. Elizabeth informed that they have a shop they work with. I picked up my vehicle around 3pm and asked about the exhaust bracket and why they were not going to replace this. Elizabeth said we have no idea if you broke it or it was a MFG issue. I asked if she even checked to see if this would be covered as this vehicle has never been taken off of the pavement and there is no damage around my exhaust pipe area. She said that she would check on it on Monday, and get back with me. She gave me the information for the muffler company. Its Friday and never heard back from Rockwall Ford, however they did send me this nice survey to fill out. I was very disappointed with this visit.

169,"June 15, 2018","This is the experience I had with Rockwall Ford, and the response that I emailed back for their customer survey...

Well, I can say one thing about the service that I received... I won't be back.

I scheduled a service appointment to have a recall performed on my 2016 Ford Fusion Monday 11, 2018.

While I was there I also wanted to have the transmission service performed (drain & fill not a ""FLUSH"").

When I came in and spoke to the Service Advisor about the recall, I told him verbatim ""I want the transmission serviced, drain & fill ""NOT A FLUSH"" I was very clear. The Service Advisor, at that time gave no inclination that he didn't understand what I was asking for.  I left and walked down the street to grab something to eat while I was waiting.

At about 30 minutes after I left, I received a call from Rockwall Ford, but now message left.

I returned the call, and spoke to someone in the service department, and told them that Rockwall Ford had called but didn't leave a message and I assumed it was from my Service Advisor and I was returning the call, I am assuming there is an issue or questions. The person that answered the phone stated that the Service Advisor was on the phone and he took my name and number and said that he would have the Service Advisor return my call back.

Approximately 2 hours go by and I received a call/voice mail stating my vehicle services was completed and ready for pick up.

I went to the Cashiers office and paid for the transmission service (drain & fill) that I had requested at the time (so I though) when I dropped off the vehicle. And that is where I noticed on the receipt that a ""FLUSH"" was performed, which I didn't understand, especially since I was very clear in my request and at the time the Service Advisor gave no indication that he didn't understand what service I was asking for.

So my first stop was with the Service Advisor, and asked why a ""FLUSH"" was performed and not the requested ""Drain & Fill"" that I requested.

He stated at that time, he miss understood me, when I told him I wanted a ""Drain and Fill, not a FLUSH"". During the discussion, I was very specific in not wanting a ""FLUSH"".

He then stated, ""well, I called you because I wasn't sure and I never called him back"" 

So now I have a Service Advisor that is flat out lying to my face.
1. The Service Advisor stating he didn't understand what service I was requesting.
2. Then after the fact saying he called me, but I didn't call him back, which I can prove I did, by my phone records and time I was on the phone with the Rockwall Ford Service Dept. after I dropped off my vehicle.

I then discussed the flush procedure with the service manager, and how I don’t agree that it accomplishes what it accomplishes. He did show me the procedure, which I still don't agree with. There is several documented issues with using transmission flush machines at garages that can cause issues down the road...i.e left over incorrect trans fluid in the machine which then gets put in the car causing issues down the road, or don’t get the transmission up to temp (which only flushes the trans cooler), etc.., with several others. Which your Service Manager says is what happened, which I don’t believe based on the integrity issues I have already experienced with ""your"" Service Advisor.

So after the discussion with the Service Manager I was so furious that I left. I promise to ""NEVER"" be back. Which the funny part is, that I bought my Fusion from Rockwall Ford , and had all of my vehicle serviced at Rockwall Ford. Because you see, I am a Ford Family guy. ALL of my vehicle are Ford as my family has a long history working for Ford, but that’s besides the point.

But what literally pisses me off is that a service was performed that; 1. I didn't request (Flush instead of the drain and fill) 2. Nor did I authorize the Flush, your Service Advisor without confirmation, on which service I requested, because he apparently doesn’t understand the difference in the two.
3. I walked out, paying for a service that I didn’t request in the end.
4. So because of paying $165 for a service I didn't authorize, I will no longer purchase or service my 3 Ford's (Fusion,Taurus,F-150) with Rockwall Ford.

And what pisses me off even more is for your Service Advisor lied to my face, and I caught him in the lie, and just not fess up and say I made a mistake. Or how about get confirmation, before authorizing the work, which he must of because he made a phone call to me, after I dropped it off. But, he continued to deny it till the end, and say he miss understood me. 

Because in the end, I'm the one that gets screwed with the service I didn't want/authorize but actually ended up paying for it.

Wouldn't that be like coming in for a flat tire, and walking out with a new car that I didn't agree too, when you specifically ask just to have the tire fixed?

So please explain to me, what you would of done differently....

So feel free to call me, but it better not be a Service Manager or Advisor, I have already been down that road and we can discuss this service call in more detail.

Sincerely,
D.T.",1.0

172,"May 02, 2018","Not sure how much space is available here. Here is a summary of my experience with the service department at Rockwall Ford. I have a 2017 Mustang GT that I purchased from an out of state dealer. It was delivered by transport. I received it mid Feb 2018. The front plate bracket was damaged during the transport. There was a scratch in the window tint, and what I was told was a defect in the paint on the rear bumper from the manufacturer. I contacted the selling dealer and they set up an appointment for me at Rockwall Ford since I live in Rockwall. The selling dealer paid forthe plate bracket and tint repairs. The bumper paint issue was handled under factory warranty. When I picked up the car, there was a huge door ding on the passenger door. I immediately gave it back to them. They kept it for a week to make that repair. This was all with less than 200 miles on the car. At about 900 miles, I noticed a spot of oil on the driveway. Took it in to the service department. Kept it 2 days. Said the transmission speed sensor o-ring was leaking. They repaired that. Noticed a big black scuff mark on the passenger fender when I got home. I buffed it out myself. The black mark came off but there are still 2 small areas of damage left behind. Within the same week, less than 100 miles later, another leak in the same area. When I took it back I expressed my concerns about the previous damage done to the car and the repair issues not being corrected. The service writer responded with "" I cant babysit them all day"". It took all I could muster not to punch him in the face. I left my car again. No update for 2 days. I call and he states he was about to call me. He is waiting on the keys and it should be ready to pick up by close. At the last minute, he calls and says they are sealing some areas up with sealant and want to let it dry overnight. All of that joy brings me to today. I am told the car is ready. I show up. Sign the paperwork stating what they repaired. Stated they test drove the vehicle, brought it back and checked for leaks and all was good. They pull the car up and the first thing I do is walk around it to look for damage considering it had been damaged 2 times before. No noticeable damage but there were greasy black handprints all over the passenger fender. I walked back inside and told a service writer. He apologized and within a couple minutes he came out with a rag and wiped it off. I get in and drive about 100 feet, still in the parking lot mind you, and notice the clutch pedal is only about 3"" off the floor. No travel in it at all. I turn around and drive it back to the service drive. I grab the first service writer I see and explain whats going on. He agrees that something is wrong. He states that unfortunately all the techs had left for the day so they will have to keep it again. Mind you, there was no clutch problem when I brought the car in for the transmission leak the 1st or 2nd time. I paid 40K for this Mustang with a Roush supercharger on it and within 1000 miles they have damaged it twice, ""repaired"" it twice, and still have it. I am afraid to look under it and see what this sealant job looks like. When I get it back this time, assuming it works and is not damaged again, I am taking it to get an exhaust system installed and will be inspecting the underneath. I will be posting this same information on Ford's website and Google.",2.0

Brad also tried to help me with a paint blemish that has appeared on my back bumper. I bought this truck about 4 months ago. It was a 2016 with low mileage and was the 2nd 2016 certified vehicle I had purchased from Rockwall in the last year. Even with extended warranty, no one wanted to take ownership of repainting the bumper - too bad, my problem not theirs. 

It's a shame that their excellent service department is overshadowed by management decisions like this and it will lead me to seek another dealer to buy from and service my vehicles.

Mason came to us with a deal.  I countered him with a longer warranty and Gap coverage included in the payment.
Mason came back all smiles and informed us that we had an approved deal, but could we come back Monday to sign documents the Director at Ford Motor Credit needed to see the letter of total loss from an accident we just had with our previous vehicle, which we had bought at Rockwall Ford.
Mason assured us that everything was approved and that we could even take the car home.  I know we asked Mason point blank more than once, is this a DONE deal and he replied YES!!
We returned Monday evening to find out that this was not a done deal and that they would require $4,000 down.
I personally approached Mason at the dealership and called him out on how being misleading and dishonest was not good business practice.  Mason's reposes to me was he told me what his boss told him.  My take from that is that the entire dealership is dishonest and misleading.
We would have been perfectly fine and accepted a negative response on Saturday that they could not get him approved, but to lie and tell him they did and allowed him to walk away from a deal he did have in place from another dealership is simply not the type of misleading, dishonest and lack of integrity in a company we want to do business with.

204,"August 01, 2017","The worst car buying experience of my entire life. I couldn't figure out why our sales guy was so ignorant and such a good liar, but then I met the GM. Our sales associate, Mason, not only told us and promised us our car was a done deal, but said the bank already approved the deal as is. Being in the car business before, I expressed (with aggressive passion) that we were not going to drive the car off the lot unless we were 100% approved. He replied that the bank already approved the deal as is, and we were only waiting to talk to the loan officer regarding the payoff on our totaled vehicle. I again expressed my concern to Mason about taking a car off the lot without siging paperwork, and he again stated that it was done deal and the bank already approved it (AS IS)! Imagine my shock when my husband showed up at the dealership to sign the paperwork, and was told we needed more money down or there wasn't a deal. I immediately called the GM, and not only did he call me back making every excuse in the book, he proceeded to insinuate I was lying to him about what his immature unexpierenced snake of a sales associate told me and my family. Just to add the cherry on top of this sundae....they didn't even call my husband to let him know the deal didn't go through. They waited until he showed up at the dealership (at the end of business) to sign paperwork to tell him they needed more money down, and that if he didn't have it to call someone to come pick him up. Again, the GM just tried to fancy talk his way through this horrible situation. Admitting that his sales person had horrible customer service, and calling me a liar in the same sentence. I have never been so humiliated, embarrassed, and treated so poorly in the entire life. Beware of the snakes that are crawling around Rockwall Ford before one bites you in the xxx. ",1.0

They even had a food truck there and they gave us a couple of tickets to be able to eat lunch.  The whole experience took about a couple of hours since I already knew which car I wanted.  Bonner even followed up with a phone call and email to make sure how everything is and to let me know I can contact him anytime with any questions.

247,"January 08, 2015","I have to admit I was skeptical to take my truck into this dealership due to the few reviews I had seen, that weren't so good. I moved here from out of state, am very particular about my vehicles, and had been dealing with a sound for over 20,000 miles that just kept getting worse, and another dealership couldn't seem to figure out what was wrong. Nervously, I took the truck in, asked if I could have a technician drive it and I ride along. Within 15 seconds the technician diagnosed my issue then took me back to the area to check to see if it was still under warranty. It was. He said he could possibly squeeze it in, and get it done by end of business day. I told him no worries if he couldn't, I was just thrilled he knew what the problem was finally. Everyone in there was willing to help, friendly, and spoke as they walked by. The technician was a little dry, but I overlooked that being he was obviously knowledgeable about his job. I thought it could stand an alignment so I asked them to do that as well, and asked if they could update my GPS. They called me and had my truck done several hours before closing, said I didn't need an alignment so they didn't feel the need to charge me for something I didn't need, and said not even the new Ford maps are as updated as they should and that I had the latest version. I was so thrilled with their customer service and that they didn't try to sell me an alignment, when they very easily could have, that they fixed my noise that was about  to drive me crazy, and all without even having had an appointment ahead of time. I have learned more than just this once you have to take some of these reviews with a grain of salt because we are all human, they aren't going to be perfect all of the time, and every once in awhile we may get a bad technician working on our vehicle and everyone is bound to have a bad day. In the end it's how the dealership overcomes to correct the mistake and make the future business better. Thanks Rockwall Ford for making my experience the best it could have been.

251,"August 05, 2014","I wrote this terrible review below about Rockwall Ford in regards to my Navigation system not working and Rockwall Ford not wanting to place  my unit.  
Although they are still not replacing my unit (Ford Corp not Rockwall Ford), The GM Jon Zilloux took time out of his very busy schedule to try and talk to me and explain the entire Navigation and electronic system in my truck and why I am having these issues.  Pointing out some new technology that I was not even close to knowing about.
I respect the fact that Mr. Zilloux cares and has taken the time to call me and even though we can't get my issues resolved, he took the time and the patience to talk me through this.
Thank you Mr. Zilloux!




I have written here once before about Rockwall Ford and when I did they jumped all over me about writing poorly about them on this site. So I was called and am still being told that the cause of my navigation issues are my oversized tires and 2""lift.  I counted on their lot yesterday and  they have 12 trucks Brand New with lifts and oversized tires and I am being told had the lift been done only at Ford I wouldn't have a problem.  So they just don't want anyone taking their trucks to other companies trying to make a living to do accessories on their vehicles.

After my last review I was asked to go back to 4 wheel parts in Dallas to have them look at the part that Rockwall Ford had me spend $300 to install as their claim was this calibrator would solve my problem and when it didn't, Rockwall Ford asked me to go back as it must be defective or there's an issue as it still didn't fix my problem with my navigation.  The guys at 4 Wheel Parts are awesome and they laughed when I told them what Rockwall Ford said and proceeded to explain to me what I already knew, that there's no way a lift and oversized tires can have my navigation location off my over a mile.   I have spoke to several other places like 4 wheel parts and they all concur.  When I asked Rockwall Ford to please call 4 wheel parts (who does lots of work for Rockwall Ford) and hear for themselves that what they are telling me, to just skirt their warranty responsibility, they refused to call and speak with those guys.

Anyway, I wanted to remind if you hadn't read the first review I sent that I received and still have in my possession an email from Wayne Osborne, the Rockwall Ford Service Manager to bring my truck in and they would replace my navigation, but now refuse to.  So I have in writing a binding agreement from their Service Manager Wayne Osborne and they will not honor that agreement.

Then I received a text from another Rockwall Ford Employee and first told me he would call 4 wheels parts, but then decided not to.  Instead, while he was on vacation, he text me back and said when I return I will get your navigation issue resolved.,  Yesterday he text me back and told me, sorry, nothing at all I can do for you.  If you had the work done here we would be happy to help, but since you didn't, good luck with your problem.

So a) if y9ou are a small business owner doing truck work or accessories you should hate Rockwall Ford b) don't buy any vehicles from Rockwall Ford as they do not stand by their product c) they have the worst service department in the area and that's not just coming from me, but from other companies that work with them.

I also brought in my 2013 Taurus which had the low air pressure light on.  They took it back, put air in it and told my wife if it does it again bring it back but we found no issues with the tire.  3 days later the same problem, take it back again and now I am told there's a nail in the tire.  That same nail had to be there the first time as well, just very poor and lazy service department that could have sent my wife and g rand children on the free and had that tire blown out, could have caused serious damage.

Additionally, I have my sister who I just recommended to Rockwall Ford when she moved here, she [purchased a brand new Ford Focus.  Took it into Rockwall Ford service recently complaining about loud noise and jerks in the transmission.  Guess what they told her........Yep, it's normal!!!!  Typical from Rockwall Ford Service.  They do not want to do the work and they do not want to have the costs of doing the repairs that are covered under warranty.

While I have in writing from the Service Manager Wayne Osborne that he WILL replace my navaigation and a text stating that this would be resolved, I am not going to rest and I will continue to push this issue with anyone and everyone that will listen or post the problems I am having with Rockwall Ford.

My next stop will be Channel 5 news and the Dallas Morning News to post how poor Rockwall Ford's service department and GM is.",2.6

A quick search engine search reveals this to be an increasing safety issue, with several complaints being filed with the NHTSA, mine recently included due to the poor response from Ford and the dealership regarding this problem.

Rockwall Ford did nothing to resolve the safety issue except charge me $500 to get the door lock repaired. The 3yr/36000 warranty had recently expired. As I questioned in the meeting with the service manager, how would he deal with this should his daughters be in the rear seat of the vehicle and the door flys open taking a corner?

Nothing was EVER disclosed to us about 2 FAILED INJECTORS or how the F350 years 2003-2007 have had recalls on their engine. Basically they took advantage of a couple who was eager to buy a truck cash. Long story short exactly 2 weeks later the engine blew. Went back to Rockwall Ford and had Service Center print out the report from the day we bought the truck, and right on the report it states, ""2 failed injectors- repairs declined"". I asked who declined the repairs and Service Center said Sales Dept did. Walked right over to sales to try to get the situation resolved and Karl (Director of Sales) basically said AS IS. He also states  as a dealer he DOES NOT have to disclose if a vehicle has mechanical issues or not. He says it is his JOB to sale the vehicle NOT to worry if it has problems or not. I recorded our conversation and if you could hear what a dirt bag he is, you would RUN FAR AWAY FROM ROCKWALL FORD!!...Oh, and the way they wanted to resolve the issue was for us to finance a 2004 GMC 2500HD for $16,999, which is only worth $6,400,(per Texas Dept of Motor Vehicles)and they wanted us to put MORE money down on a truck that is nowhere near the truck we bought. Rockwall Ford is a dealership that has NO integrity, morals or values when it comes to their customers. They will rip you off and not even think twice.

As we approached the car, we noticed the lights blink as someone remotely armed the alarm on the car. My daughter reached inside and opened the door from the inside and the alarm blasted us. I looked over and saw salesmen laughing about it. We left without purchasing a vehicle. This was the second time we had visited the dealership. We were treated rudely then as well. I strongly advise people to shop elsewhere for their new Ford vehicle.",1.0
277,"May 10, 2012","Purchased a 2007 VW Passat in mid December 2011, in January 2012 took it to the VW dealership for routine service and was told that the timeing belt should have been replaced at the milage it had when purchased, i had the work done by a local repair shop when they had it tore down they noticed the bolts had backed out of the upper motor mount bracket and they found one of the bolt holes had been heli coiled, they finished the work anm secured the bolts, cost of repairs $1,000.00.  Hindsite is always 20/20 I should have stopped the work when they found the bolt issue but at 19 this is my first car experience and I just wanted it fixed.  May 2012 had severe engine vibration took it back to my repair shop and was told the bolt with the heli coil had stripped out, I called Rockwall Ford spoke with Morris Carter the salesman I bought the car from, he told me there was nothing they would do about it, it had been 6 months since I bought the car.  The next day May 8th, Morris Carter called and told me he spoke with his manager and to bing the car to them ""they would either fix it or hook me up with another car"".  I paid $113.00 to have it towed there only to be told, after the service department talked to Morris Carter, that Rockwall Ford was not coving any of the repair charges and Morris Carter said he never spoke to me about bringing it in.  I believe Rockwall Ford knew the condition of the car prior to sale and possibly did the shoddy repairs to it before they sold it to me.  I would never recommend anyone do business Morris Carter or with this dealership.",1.8
278,"September 17, 2011","I bought a new 2011 f150 on June 6, 2011.  As of September 17, 2011 I have not received my registration and license plates.  I have contacted them via visit to dealership, phone calls, and emails. I was told by Will Nobles on Sept 2 that my plates had been found at Dallas Dodge and they would be in Rockwall the following week (Sept 5th).  On Sept 13th I received an email from Faye Capell saying that they are still waiting for paperwork (over 3 months since the sale).  On Sept 17th, I sent an email to Ford.com to complain and I am expecting to hear from them in 2 business days.  Hope I do.  I have talked to two others customers who said they had a similar problem with Rockwall Ford (license plates etc).  I recommend looking for some other Ford dealer when buying a Ford product.",3.0
279,"June 22, 2011","I went in to this dealership to buy a car I had seen online.  It looked like a good price for a certified used car, or so it showed in the ad.  I spoke with a salesman (a very nice guy) and test drove the car, and liked it very much.  We negotiated a price, and while the floor manager wasn't happy about it, he shook my hand on the deal.  I agreed to pay $24,000 plus TT&L, specifically.  When they came with the invoice, I saw several extra fees that I, of course asked about.  I was told ""Everyone pays those"", even though we had said specifically what I would pay.  When the manager came in, he threw a fit, tore up our paperwork, and broke the deal, saying that he didn't need to be ""Nickle and dimed"".  Extremely unprofessional at best.  

I'd like to say if they met the original deal that I would go back and finish it, but if that's the way they choose to treat customers with cash in hand, how can I trust them to stand behind their product?  I'm buying the truest form of a commodity, so I will just take my business elsewhere.  I can't in good conscience recommend them to anyone else.",1.3
280,"May 26, 2011",Everything went great and I didn't feel any pressure from anyone about buying my car. Morris was great to work with! He took care of all my needs. I can tell he loves his job by the way he assisted me! I will tell all my family and friends about your dealership! Thank Rockwall Ford!,4.6
281,"May 23, 2011","I was not aware that the right shock absorber was leaking. I was impressed that the service department checked so thoroughly found the problem and fixed it while it is still under warranty! That very seldom happens with other dealerships I have dealt with. I certainly appreciate that level of service, and will trust the service team in the future.",4.6
282,"March 22, 2011",i got a 03 cobra from rockwall the car was a lemon from day one! motor was bad so they rebuilt it there and not even two years later the motor is bad again. i also had tranny problems out the door when i took it back the tech said its the fly wheel and cluth! WRONG it was the tranny witch i had to have rebuilt! the rear also gave out on it to witch they did fix about a year ago  and is bad again. the car has been in a shop more than on the road and they dont care seem like they were super nice til you drove off the lot.,1.6
283,"November 09, 2010",Rockwall Ford is a complete scam!! I have a truck that I had in there for repair that they charged me $1400 to supposedly fix and it still does not run.  I have been talking with not only the general manager who was very rude and no help to me at all but also a service advisor named Floyd Hume.  I have spent over $3000 between Rockwall Ford and Wichita Falls Ford and the truck is still not running.  I would never recommend taking any vehicle to the Rockwall Ford service department.  They are a complete scam and very unprofessional and have no idea what customer satisfaction is!!!!!,1.0
284,"October 13, 2010","Was originally told they could get a car I liked from another dealership, so went there and was given tentative figures.  When I returned they tried to sell me a different vehicle and changed all the figures enormously.  Naturally I refused that deal and nothing more was ever mentioned about the original deal.   To make it short and sweet it was there way or the highway, so I am on the highway(LOL)",2.3
285,"June 10, 2010","We took a company truck, which was early in its warranty period, to Rockwall Ford, for what was diagnosed by our trusted local mechanic as a problem which fell under the warranty. The service center stated that there was water in the fuel tank and that there would be a 600. charge to drain it. This service was already done TWICE at our mechanic's shop and it was found that there was NO water in the tank. (The root problem was warrantied.) Consequently, the service center insisted that there would be a CHARGE of over 100. to test drive the truck so THEY could determine if there was any further problem. Why would Ford charge a warrantied vehicle owner to diagnose a possible warranty vehicle problem? We ended up taking our truck to Prestige Truck Ford Service Center. Will report on their progress. 6-1-10, Follow-up: We just found out that Rockwall Ford CANCELLED our Warranty without informing us. We were not told by Rockwall Ford that our warranty was cancelled. We found this out quite by accident when we looked up our warranty dates for service when our truck was taken to Prestige. It looks like this is a retaliatory act for this review and the statement that was made that we would file a complaint for their poor customer service. We were also told that a dealer can do this if a service they recommended is not done. Interesting. As a side note, we would not have found out the warranty was cancelled, and we are still paying for this warranty in our monthly payment without receiving the service. Fraud. Shoddy customer service on their behalf. This just furthers my original claim of poor and unprofessional customer service.",1.2
286,"December 13, 2009","They had what I call a teaser ad for a 2010 vehicle which actually existed on their lot. The vehicle did have some dealer ad-ons which weren't stated in the conversations prior to arriving - the typical overpriced window tint, alarm and nitrogen in the tires. Those were negotiated down and I paid very close to the sale price.

Very good staff, no high pressure sales pitch and I was out the door in less than 4 hours. This was my first experience with this specific Ford dealer and it would be my first choice on another Ford purchase.    ",5.0
287,"September 05, 2009","We were in the process of purchasing a vehicle from Rockwall Ford and had taken possession of the vehicle. Two weeks later they call to inform us that they ""overlooked"" the fraud alert on my credit report. They FAILED to even verify that I was who I said I  was and let us drive off with the vehicle. When the fraud alert got in the way because the bank was trying to verify it, we decided to return the vehicle only to find out that they had sold our trade-in at auction (with no title and they did not even pay it off!) We were stuck, they told us to drive the vehicle until they cut us a check for the trade. We went in to return it today and they refused to accept the vehicle, claiming that we owed them $9500 for the use of it!!! I will NEVER recommend Rockwall Ford to anyone EVER!!!",1.0
