1,"January 19, 2012","Made and offer on vehicle. A appraisal was done on my vehicle- for Trade-in.  I was persuaded to go to bank, get pay stubs, W2, etc after i made an offer on Vehicle. I said "" I am highly interested. ---Bank was doing the counts, etc--I had to work at 3pm.---Credit checks, etc-- I got a text message telling me it got sold.---  I replied-with dissapointment-since we were both aware that my work schedule was an impedement to be at a consistent attentiveness after offer was made and the day after was our continuing meeting for the results and ending process.----- I was told that He(seller) wasnt aware of another offer before me, but i replied by saying "" When our offer was taken to management and modified/approved--didnt management know of another offer before mine?""-----well at this point i got no answer---

I just wished someone wouldve contacted us, in a professional to see if we didnt want or ....truck.---Which sales and management knew we wanted because of offer and steps in place.",2.0
