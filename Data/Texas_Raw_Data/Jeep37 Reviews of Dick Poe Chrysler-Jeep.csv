9,"May 11, 2019","The service crew is awesome, however, it always takes a whole day or two to work on simple warranty work which is a major inconvenience for some customers. Dealer should provide a loaner car, whether or not a customer has purchased an extended warranty from the dealership as other dealerships does so.",4.0

I come from Silver City NM because I like the service and care that I receive.,4.8

20,"November 25, 2018","I initially went to Dick Poe to buy a used vehicle, however, Marco Lozano was kind enough to show me the newer vehicles of the make I was looking for. With an extensive amount of discounts, I was able to take home a brand new Jeep as opposed to a used model that was around the same price! Marco’s knowledge and expertise made buying from Dick Poe an enjoyable experience. 10/10 would recommend. They are also very helpful to their military patrons. ",5.0

23,"September 28, 2018","So I've been doing buisness with Dick Poe since 2006. I've yet to ever have any bad experiences with sales, service or parts. Everyone is super professional and courteous. I would definitely recommend anyone looking for a new vehicle to check them out.  Ray Segoviano has been my sales guy for years. He and finance have always come through no matter what the situation. Service hasn't treated my family and I very well. Easy to talk to and ask questions. ",5.0

I had experiences before when buying a car would take a whole day at the dealership plus the next day go back to sign the contract.  Mr. Louie Gonzalez was very knowledgeable but specially very kind and interested in what I was looking for.  Each person we came in contact with at the dealership was courteous.  Mr. Phill in finance was very knowledgeable as well.   When I took my vehicle to get detailed again they only took way less time than I anticipated.    Thank you so much for your great service.

35,"October 28, 2017",I want to thank the employees from Dick Poe for treating well. I have had issues with a 2014 Jeep Latitude that I had purchased from Sunland Chrysler.  I had several issues with the transmission. I took it to them 3 times and was told that they could not duplicate the problem and that nothing was wrong with it.  I researched the problem on-line only to find that there are several issues with 2014 transmissions on Jeep.  I was fed up up and almost joined in a Class Action Law suite against Chrysler.  My attorney advised me to try another dealership. I went into Dick Poe and met with the manager(I forgot his name). He was well aware of the issues with transmissions and never denied it(unlike Sunland who made me feel stupid).  He did all he could and was very honest. I decided to buy a new jeep and they were very helpful. Thank Alvaro!  THANK YOU DICK POE for being honest. I will always go back to you in the future.  mp,1.8
36,"December 10, 2009","I had to take my car to the dealer's body shop after it was damaged by hail. My car spent eight (8) weeks in the shop. During that time I went to the shop a few times to check on the progress, the first time I saw it, after 4 weeks, they had done nothing to my car, not a single body panel was being repaired. The roof and the rear door had been removed; the door was standing on the bare floor leaning against the rear bumper (1). They promised it would take one more week to finish the job, and the story started, I kept calling and they would tell me it was going to take 3 more days or so. On the 6th week I had decided to tell them to put my car together so I could take it to another body shop to finish the repairs but before I was able to say so one of the employees told me his father had been through a surgery so I tried to understand the situation, I went in to see my car and this time it didn't have a windshield and the dashboard and front seats were covered in dirt and dust which made me feel very bad, that was pure negligence, I had been taking a lot of care of my car just to find about this negligence. I came back on a different day to talk to the general manager about this situation and we went together to see my car, they all were lucky that the back of the seats had been put back to vertical position and the dashboard had been covered with a black plastic due to the paint they were about to apply. He didn't see my car in the condition I saw it but still I told them they were taking too long to finish the job and they were only letting more dirt get to the interior of my car. The general manager and the body shop manager promised me the car would be ready in a week...yes the repairs where done by the next week and I went to pick up my car only to find out how much they had messed up with my car. The canvas roof had a water stain, the rear door's paint had been peeled off from standing on the bare floor, the doors had paint runs, the acrylic at the gauges is full of dust on the inside, imagine how this dust looks whenever direct sun light hits on the gauges, it just makes the instrument panel opaque, it looks terrible. Water is leaking through the ""seal"" of the windshield. (They must have broken the windshield because it had not been damaged by the hail), they massively dented the gaskets around the windows on the side they did the repairs, they scratched the paint on different spots around the car...they replaced the hood but did not put the brand (Jeep) logo back, etc...Should I say more?
I made some remarks on the way they were doing things and the general manager just told me it was “normal procedure” so you better be careful with the normal procedures at Dick Poe Chrysler-Jeep.
