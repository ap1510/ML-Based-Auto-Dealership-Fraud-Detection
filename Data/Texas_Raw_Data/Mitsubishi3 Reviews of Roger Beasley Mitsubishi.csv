0,"December 15, 2016","Tim is amazing. I come from a LONG LONG line of car dealership family members.. Dad is a GSM, uncles, close family friends, brother is a finance manager at a dealership.. pretty hard to get my attention, let alone impress me OR keep me as a customer.. Tim is honestly a stand up guy! I went to RB Mitsu 3 years ago to buy an outlander Sport, wasnt thrilled with my sales person but was without wheels due to my last vehicle getting totaled out on the side of the road by a drunk driver.. so i bout the sport.. 3 years later, the Outlanders bodystyle changed and it was an eye catcher, so at an appointment for service I met Tim.. he gave me his card and told me to let him know when i was ready! A few months later I took an employee to see him.. there was just something about this sales guy that really made me feel like he was the best person to help her out.. and sure enough, I was 1000% right.. 2 months later, I went back and saw Tim for my Outlander.. SOLD! I tell Tim all the time he had better not leave Mitsu.. I'll only buy mitsu's and I'll only buy from him! If you want a reliable car with all the features you could want at a price you'll never beat, go see him, you won't be let down!",5.0

2,"August 26, 2016","Ended up crossing 3 things off my to-do list at one stop: state inspection, oil change and car wash!  Service personnel were very nice and informative.  Waiting area was great too!",5.0
