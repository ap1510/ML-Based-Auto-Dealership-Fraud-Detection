We cannot thank you enough for everything you did to help us get into our new cars! You listened to our needs, heard what we were saying, and best of all made it happen - under our budget! If I could give you a million stars for your work, I truly would! Buying a car is a stressful and confusing process and we walked out of there feeling well-informed and happy with our decision. 
Even though the process took a few hours, we never felt like a number to you two. You always checked in, gave us updates, and most important of all - you were both so honest with the information! This was our second time working with Javier and our first time with Jacob. I can honestly say that we are NEVER going to another dealership because of these two guys! Thank you for all your help and hard work! You two are truly a dream team!

3,"October 29, 2018","I was very impressed with the service received when purchasing my daughters Honda Civic, Aaron Gonzalez went above and beyond to provide us with information and a fair price.  I have purchased cars from other dealers to include Nissan, Mazda, Chevrolet and KIA but by far this has been the best experience ever.  I highly recommend Aaron and Edward.  ",5.0
4,"May 30, 2018","Juda Escobar was very knowledgeable and courteous and provided outstanding customer service!  He went above and beyond to meet our needs in the purchase of our CRV!  Steve Wayne, our salesman,  was very helpful and provided great customer service and answered all our questions. We will definitely recommend El Paso Honda to all our family and friends for all their vehicle needs!  ",5.0
5,"February 20, 2018","Working with sales consultant Edward Rivero was great as he gave me the best information about the vehicle and constantly kept me updated about the arrival of the vehicle. Finance manager, Gerry Vera gave me an affordable and great deal. As it was my first time buying a vehicle they really helped on every question I had.
Highly recommend this location and the staff! ",5.0

8,"May 30, 2017","Dealership sold me a warranty bumper-bumper including windshield repair.  took the car in for a small crack no bigger than a quarter. Was told that the warranty I purchased did not cover this size crack, however contract specifically states repairs include cracks and scratches.  they advised me to contact my insurance i nstead since they couldn't help me. they were excited to get my business, but not so excited to help us even after I purchased $3000 in warranties. Rodney Varela service advisor has poor customer service skills. Would rather be with his co worker buddies instead of assisting with any issues at work.",1.0

10,"October 19, 2016","My wife and I went to Honda to trade in our corolla for the 2016 Honda Pilot. Our Sales person was Esteban Sanchez, he was very helpful and very respectful. He worked with us and made sure we were happy with our buying process. He was very patient and knowledgable about all the vehicles. The overall experience at El Paso Honda is five stars. I recommend that when you go to El Paso Honda, you speak with Esteban Sanchez. I will diffidently go back to see him when I trade my truck for another Honda!",5.0
11,"August 31, 2016","I have been a sales rep for 35 yrs and drive over 11 states @ 60,000 miles yr
First I have owned countless Hondas 
My experience since I buy each year is to find a dealership that has integertry
This is the dealership that the people are as good as the quality of their product.
It's hard to find in this day in time people you can count on as I count on my car both day in night.
A wise man told me a bar stool has three legs .. If on is gone it falls.. Here the dealership, car, and my purchase
Thank you",5.0

15,"November 30, 2015","I purchased the new 2016 honda civic sedan about two weeks ago , I am very satisfied with my civic it runs smoothly and the turbo feels awsome  , picks up speed immediately , it saves me alot of gas  . What i love about it the most is how big the inside is , it has various compartments inside the arm rest not to mention the seats come with its own individual heaters for your butt (: very cozy for winter . The computer update it comes with is excellent very accurate and fast i really recommend the new 2016 civic i dont regret one bit purchasing my car ! The salesman who helped me out was really friendly he did a great job listening to my needs/wants , helped me out in every step to purchase my car . I will definitely be going back to purchase another car at El Paso Honda ! ",5.0
