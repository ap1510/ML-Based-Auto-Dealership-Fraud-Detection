0,"June 04, 2020",Joe Payan and his team were wonderful! He came to get us in the car we wanted to buy so my husband could test drive it back to Killeen. We live in Temple. They worked with us and got payments to what we wanted. They went through the finance process with us step by step even though we were pre approved. They showed us all the car features step by step as well. They are so friendly and go above and beyond to make you feel important. Thank you for taking care of us so wel!,5.0
1,"May 03, 2020","Scheduled a test drive for 12:30. I was on the road at 11. Arrived at 12:35 and the car was sold. Marisa emailed at 11:15 confirming my appointment. We all know the car buying process does not last 20 or 30 minutes. She should have emailed informing me someone else was purchasing the vehicle.
They offered to ""fill up"" up my car. Yes, putting $5 in my car makes up for your lack of professionalism, the 150 miles I drove, and the 3 hours out of my day.
It is evident they only care about the sale and not people. They didn't offer to help me find another vehicle or anything. ",1.0
2,"January 19, 2020","From the beginning, I have been advised to stay away from any dealer in Killeen. I can say I am extremely happy that I was able to go down the street to Dennis Eakin Kia and have such an amazing buying experience. I came in on Monday with my 20 month old and was greeted by Jeff right away. I told him that I was interested in the Kia Telluride and he drove it right up so I can see the interior and mentioned some of the safety features that came included in the EX. Within 30 minutes we were on the road to test drive the Telluride and I was sold! I came in knowing what I wanted but had to wait till Wednesday to buy and he did not pressure me into buying throughout the process and very understanding as to why I waited an extra day. The inside of the dealer was super neat and clean and everyone was friendly and it felt very welcoming to come in! I am so happy with my Telluride and am glad I had Jeff assisting me through the whole process!! I 10/10 recommend especially if you are not wanting to drive hours away for the exact same vehicle when you can have a great experience right here at home.",5.0

My service advisor Billy was very informative as to what was needed for my car.  I also asked him to inspect my exhaust system because I had a possible leak.  My car was ready within two hours and Billy came to the waiting room to get us.  Walked to the car with us and verbally informed us what services were completed to our car. I have been to two dealerships in Austin and none of the service advisors have given us personal service like this.  I bought my car in Killeen from another excellent salesperson (Jeff San Nicolas) and have returned for service there because of the outstanding Excellent service and friendliness I have received at Dennis Eakin Kia. Great feeling of comfort knowing my car will be serviced expertly.  ",5.0

21,"September 25, 2019","My least favorite thing in the world... buying a new car. Oddly enough that changed last week. My son purchased a new Telluride with the help of  salesman Jamie John.  I wasn’t in the market for a new vehicle as I had a wonderful 2015 Tahoe. I fell in love with the look of his and thought it won’t hurt to go look. Again, Jamie John met me and took extra good care of my desires for the hard to find Telluride. Debbie in finance made me feel like we were long lost friends. She was precious ??. Long story short I traded in my Tahoe and have a beautiful new dark moss Telluride in my garage. ",5.0

88,"January 17, 2019","I bought my first new vehicle from Dennis Eakin Kia in 2012. It was a 2013 Forte SX. The service was great, the people were great, and the car was awesome for a small car. I loved that car. But two years later I wanted a bigger car so I traded in the Forte and bought a new 2016 Optima while I was waiting to get an oil change on the Forte. The salesman offered to have the windows tinted for free as well. The car was great but did not have as many options on it as the Forte. Apparently I had free oil changes for the first 3 years of owning it and every time I went into get an oil change, done, I paid for it. No one ever reminded me of that. Then in April of 2018, I went in for an oil change and ended buying my 3rd brand new vehicle from Dennis Eakin Kia; a 2018 Sportage FE. I was told the vehicle had the Android Go version of the radio. Whoever waxed the vehicle for me while I was doing the paperwork got wax on the plastic bumpers which never comes off. No offers to tint windows either. 

The quality and service got progressively cheaper as I bought new higher priced vehicles from them. Just yesterday I was told by the Service Department that my version of Sportage is basically ""As Is"". I cannot upgrade the radio due to wiring issues. I should have never traded in the Forte SX. If I buy another Kia, it probably won't be from this Kia dealership. 

Service department is great though. Fast and friendly. I never have had any issues with them.  I love the Dennis Eakin Kia Service Department. But's that's it anymore. ",3.8

96,"January 04, 2019","I am 56 years old and have purchased many vehicles in my lifetime. I have purchased more vehicles at Dennis Eakin Kia than all my purchases before combined. I drove my Honda Passport until it was no longer cost effective to bandage up.....and never drove a new vehicle until I purchase my second Optima at Dennis Eakin. Bottom line up front, not only do they make the purchasing process easy, they bend over backward to give me the best deal. Until I started buying cars at Dennis Eakin I never knew what being a part of a car dealership family felt like. Now I do, and I will never buy a car anywhere else. To Terry, Debbie, Mario, Chris, Desi, Paul, Shawn, and the entire team, thank you. A special thanks to Kimberly and Shaun also. I love Dennis Eakin!

102,"November 16, 2016","I started the process last month, WELL aware of my credit situation. Salesman told me to come back with 2500 down for a 15,000 dollar vehicle. Got it. I come back 4 weeks later with 2,000 in hopes of finding something cheaper. Salesman gives me run around, no follow ups. I have to constantly call while 5 different people are telling me 5 different things. Finance manager TELLS me I have to get just one car 2014 with 90000 miles on it. NOT IF IM PUTTING 2000 down no maam! After this dealership was unable to get me approved after 4 weeks of back and forth and all sorts of miscommunication. I went to the dealer across the street and got approved in 8 minutes. CPO Nissan with warranty and a few upgrades . What took Dennis Eakin Kia 4 weeks to tell me what they were going to make me get and nothing else could be done the other dealer got it done in 3 hours and I have a new car outside ! Thanks Dennis Eakin Kia for being unwilling to work with me. You made the Nissan dealer some money with the same bank! I only give two stars because the lady in the front and the salesman were very nice aside from the miscommunication  and looked professional. ",3.2
103,"October 20, 2016","My husband and I were interested in purchasing a Kia, we had family flying into town for the weekend and thought we'd call and ask about driving the vehicle we were interested in for the weekend and have a big enough car for the whole family, they said yes, took our info, insurance, driver's licenses, let us test drive it....then at the last minute they told us we couldn't have the vehicle for the weekend...over text! The excuse was fishy....We scrambled to find a rental but it was way too late, we were out a bigger car and disappointed in the fact that they promised it to us then took it back....we will be purchasing else where from now on ",1.0

105,"September 29, 2016","Incredible customer service! Military friendly! Great financeing rates! 

I dealt with a Mr. Jeff Nicolas, his approach was to listen to what my budget was, what my needs were and and what I'd like to drive. With absolutely no pressure, he showed me the vehicles and their accompanying CARFAX without me even asking. He made me and my entire family comfortable and allowed.us to build confidence in a purchase of our choice. 

I thank him and the entire staff at Dennis Eakin KIA.",4.8

I received a letter from Dennis Eakin Kia offering me a fresh start. I read it a few times and decided to give them a call, it was an outstanding experience, no hassles, no false hope, no gimmic! I drove away with a brand new 2015 Kia forte the same day! Mark was my sales person which made a first time experience of purchasing a brand new automobile less frantic!!!

I am proud to be a new KIA owner and exceptionally satisfied with the professionalism and family friendly this dealership offers. truly among the best I have ever seen. We are still raving about out new Optima. We absolutely love this car! Thank you so very much for all you did for us! Our drive from Austin was well worth it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

113,"August 13, 2012","This was the best car buying experience I have ever had. Mark was friendly but not pushy, which is a refreshing change of pace from most salesmen. He was extremely knowledgable about the vehicles and made me feel at ease (I usually hate buying cars). The financial lady, Debi (sp?) was awesome. I will recommend Dennis Eakin Kia to all my friends and family. Super amazing job!!",5.0

120,"January 25, 2012","My wife needed a new car.  Her BMW X-5 had become unreasonable to maintain, was giving us ""service"" lights when it didn't need any services. We were looking for a nice, reliable SUV with: No.1: An excellent safety rating and No. 2: an excellent maintenance history, with excellent dealership support.  We found our new car at Dennis Eakin Kia.  It is our first Kia, and for the money, this car CANNOT be beat.  It doesn't compare to LandRover or BMW, it surpasses them in both quality and reliability.  It drives like a dream, responsive but also smooth.  Visibility is excellent.  We love the car. We, like many who have left reviews for this dealership, were limited on both time; (to buy the car), and we were also limited on a fixed budget.  The staff worked diligently to get our payment down where we could afford the car, and also worked to give us the maximum amount of allowable trade-in value.  They didn't try to sell us a lower-grade model car, they upped our trade-in value mid-range with what we came to the dealership with, and that was impressive.  I'm not saying we didn't bargain.  We did, but so did they, and in good faith--selling us a car that we love that we could afford, not something we'd have to ""settle"" with on our budget.  I would strongly recommend that you check out this dealership because they do what no other dealership in Killeen Texas does:  They tell it to you straight.  No one there at Dennis Eakin Kia is going to rush you, including at their published closing time; (1800hrs / 6:00 p.m.).  All of their staff seemed to know all of their vehicles, and their staff treated us with respect and courtesey.  I will do business with this dealership again in the future because of their professionalism, courtesey, and EXCELLENT hours of operation and accomodation.  We didn't get out of their until well past 6:00 p.m., but we never felt that we were a burdon.  My wife's work schedule and limited free time cannot be under-estimated in this entire buying process.  Dennis Eakin Kia worked with us and seemed to know our situation and respect that we are a working family, on a fixed budget with limited time.  It is not an understatement that we were treated as what we are, valued customers.  If you're thinking BMW, Jeep, Ford or Dodge--think again and look at the warranty offered with the KIA, it's features and the reliability of this fine automobile.  I'm encouraging you to think about Dennis Eakin Kia in Killeen not only because they are our neighbors, but they are truly GREAT!  This truly is a one-of-a-kind low pressure dealership that goes the extra distance because they know they are selling a superior car for the money with superior value and reliability.  This is a sincere thank you to all the staff for making our new SUV a reality.  Thanks for your professionalism!",4.8
121,"January 11, 2012","My wife and i just bought our first Kia. We are very happy on how we where treated thru the whole process. Cause of our work hours we showed up usually around closing time. But there was no sign what so ever that the employes where trying to get out on time. The night i took my new SUV home one of the departments where to print the temporary tag from was closed so Mark gave me a Dealer owned temp tag. Said come back tomorrow he will give it to me my temp tag then. He could have said hey you cant take the car home tonight cause don't have a tag for you. Not the case. Also the lady at the service department apologized a lot for not having the flyer for the service and maintenance schedule she just had a copy which was totally fine. 

Everybody there who i met and talked to was very nice and helpful always answered all the questions. If somebody didn't know the answer they got back to me within 2 min. 

I must say other dealerships in this town care more about just selling the car and not the people who are looking to buy a car. 
At Kia you can get a whole lot of car for an awesome price. Definitely will keep Kia at the top of my list when i trade my second car. 

Thank you again, to all the Dennis Eakin Kia Staff Member. 

Sincerely Patrick & Desiree",5.0
122,"January 02, 2012","I was very impressed when we first pulled up and couldn't have been happier by the end.  They are in a nice area, right off of Highway 190.  The exterior is new and clean as is the Service Department.  Employees are dressed appropriately and nicely and extremely professional.  My only negative is that after the oil change I did expect the car to be vacummed and was disappointed to see that it was not.",4.8

We was not even planning on purchasing a vehicle.  Kristie gave us the keys and told us the vehicle will speak for it's self. She gave us the history of the vehilce and we was impressed of the knowledge she had on the vehicle. We was sold and now enjoy our new truck, thanks to Kristie. The manager was helpful and the lady who did our financing was not only helpful, but friendly. She educated us on not only this purcahse, but how we can improve on our the next purchase. Would highly recommend this dealership and of course Kristie and her associates.",5.0
126,"December 09, 2011",I felt that Kristie exhibited the type of salesmanship I look for when I go to a car dealership. I do not like to be bombarded with offer after offer as soon as I set foot onto the lot. Kristie took the time to listen to our needs and understand that our purchase was not going to be immediate. She also was prepared with the answers to our questions. The most important part of the whole experience was that fact that she showed  interest even after we expressed we would be purchasing at a later date. When we are ready to purchase our next vehicle I will be definitely be going to Dennis Eakin Kia and would love to finalize our purchase with Kristie! ,5.0
127,"November 22, 2011","I am very pleased with the personal touch of the service they provide.  They are very knowledgeable and professional; always courteous.  They come to pick us up and drop us off during the times we need servicing.  We have had our Sedona since 2007 and each time it is the same.  I can't imagine having our Sedona serviced by anyone else.  We always look forward to seeing them again.  If ever I could trust a business to have my best interest in mind, it is surely Dennis Eakin Kia and there crew.",5.0

129,"August 15, 2011",If I knew better I would of traveled a bit longer to get to another Kia dealership. This is the worst example of time management and efficiency I have ever seen.
