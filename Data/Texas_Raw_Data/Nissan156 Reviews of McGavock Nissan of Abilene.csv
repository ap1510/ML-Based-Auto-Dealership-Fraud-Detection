38,"September 25, 2018","Samantha Bryant, our salesperson, went above and beyond.  She never put pressure on us, but was truly interested in our needs.  She worked within our budget to get us the best truck for the best deal she could.  She met us on a very hot day, not fazed at all by the miserable heat.  The final sale occurred during a rainstorm, and she made sure we were comfortable while she paraded several trucks for our inspection.  At first, we asked her about pre-owned vehicles.  Nothing daunted, she spent a lot of time searching for the perfect vehicle for us, and she did her best to find what we wanted in a pre-owned vehicle.  She wound up getting us a new, beautiful Titan within our budget.  We are very, very pleased with our truck, as well as with the value of our purchase. We felt that Samantha, as well as everyone we met at McGavock Nissan of Abilene, really cared that we made the best choice and were really happy with our purchase.

73,"September 18, 2017",I recently crashed my car and was devastated w/ my loss. Luckily my insurance covered most of it and I had gap insurance as well. I recently purchased a car a month ago through this dealership because my last car was a Nissan and I loved driving it. They offered my a brand new car w/ 0% interest for a reasonable price and payment. Jesse was my dealership and he has helped me w/ all my questions that I had and taught me a lot about the car that I didn't know about. I recommend seeing Jesse because he will most certainly take care of you and will call you to be certain your new car is everything you want and more. They know that a car is a huge investment so they make sure you are fully aware and knowledgeable about the car you are buying from them and I appreciated it a lot. They're always there to help and makes you feel like you're not just another person buying a car from them. And they certainly helped me get over the loss of my other car lol,5.0

139,"April 20, 2015","My wife and I had been shopping for a small to mid-sized crossover/SUV for about three weeks.  When we arrived at the McGavock Dealership it was raining.  We explained to Mike Hall what we were looking for and he asked about exterior/interior color preferences.  We asked him to look through his inventory, and agreed we'd come back the next day to test drive what he found.  When we arrived the next morning Mike had a 2015 Rogue waiting at the front of the dealership.  To make a long story short, it was perfect!  Mike and the sales manager, Jay Martinez, came up with a price that was very reasonable - I am not a ""haggler""; they asked what was comfortable for us and then worked the trade-in value, down payment, and financing plan so everything went together.  We made a deal.  Then Christian DeHoyos carefully walked us through the paperwork, we signed the papers, and drove our new Rogue home.  It had been a very long day, but we were pleased with our whole experience.

The thing that really felt good to us is there was never any ""high pressure"" in our interactions at McGavock.  Sure, they wanted to sell us the car, but when we said, ""No,"" to anything they seemed fine with what we said.  We told Mike what we wanted and he made it happen.  Bravo!",5.0
