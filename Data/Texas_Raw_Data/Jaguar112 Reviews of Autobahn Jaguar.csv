6,"February 01, 2020",I love the Jaquar service department in Ft. Worth! I live in Dallas; however I’ve had a few very bad experiences with their service department as they do not fix the problem and usually create a new problem. The Jaquar dealership in ft. Worth is so much better. They drive to Dallas to pick up my car and give me a Jaquar loaner car. Corey is my service advisor and he has always provided excellent service. Corey keeps me updated about my car and the progress. Corey is very to get in contact with...I highly recommend them for service!,5.0
7,"January 29, 2020","I worked with Chris Howard on buying my new car.  He was very professional and got back to me quickly.  I really enjoyed working with him and the whole dealership.  I look forward to buying more cars from Autobahn.  It was by far my best experience yet.  From the test drive to the finance paperwork.  I am tired of the days that you are stuck at the dealership for hours during the sales process.  It was so easy!  I was in and out, made my decision and the the finance paperwork was done.  I came into sign and left with my car.  Great experience!  Thank you autobahn for selling me my dream car for a great deal and painless sales process.  It was really fun and not stressful at all!

23,"April 14, 2019","Terrance was a wonderful person to work with. We found the Jaguar F-Pace online and began to negotiate a deal. Terrance was professional and extremely diligent as we reached an agreement. Every aspect of the vehicle purchase was communicated by phone or email, within a week. Once we arrived to take delivery of the vehicle, every item we had agreed upon was completed and ready to go.  The papers were ready to be signed.  The group was so helpful and gracious once we arrived. They explained features included in the F-Pace and how to make the best of these functions. All together it was a wonderful car buying experience. The group followed up with a phone call the next week in regards to our trip home, the vehicle features and any question we may have.  The team certainly cares about the customer and goes out of their way to answer any questions or concerns in a timely manner.  This was my first experience buying a vehicle from Autobahn Jaguar in Fort Worth, however I do not think it will be the last. Thank you for your hard work and professional team. ",5.0

Service Center and Sales has personalized hard working people do what you ask and are very fair and accommodate you like a King or Queen.  Offered loaner for all service appointment.  Further, When I leased my new XE, it was perfectly ready to go warmed up when I got there and I was financed all paper signed and in the new car in 20 minutes.

I'll  definitely lease or by my next Jag from them which is just around the corner.

Do not waste your time with any other Jag dealership, my other experiences elsewhere were disasters.

32,"December 13, 2018","Dear Service,

Thank you for being so kind and accommodating.  When I drove to Fort Worth for service after being told it would be 6 weeks to get a loaner from the Jaguar dealership here in Austin I knew I would have great service from Autobahn but did not expect the generosity I received.  I expressed a valid real concern about my windshield and the dangers caused by the solar lines when combated with headlights, stop lights, for that matter any lights while driving at night.  You combine a dangerous situation with rain, one can become literally blinded while driving.  I have been trying to find a solution to getting a new windshield since about three weeks after purchasing the car, the first time I drove my new car at night.  I never would have had any idea as you do not test drive a car at night.  As you know it has rained for almost three months now here in Texas and about a month ago my husband and I were driving at home in the dark, pouring rain and passing a raised truck and for moments I had to slam on my breaks as we could not see anything out the front windshield because we were completely blind.  This situation is already a dangerous one, but combined with the solar lines in the windshield that disperse light it could be deadly as Jaguar should address.  The benefits of a ""heated"" windshield are simply NOT worth it.  Autobahn has not only found a solution for me to get a new windshield that still has all the features I purchased with the car other than being heated, they have agreed to pay for the replacement.  I was not expecting this nor was my intent but I am truly grateful.  I do hope that my concerns are raised up to a higher level before someone gets into a wreck, maybe not even understanding what happened to them as it took me a little while to figure out it was not my eyes it was the windshield causing the problem.",5.0
33,"December 07, 2018","I just took advantage of Jaguar's 3 month pull-ahead program on leases. I turned in my 2016 F-Type that I leased from Autobahn 3 years ago and leased a 2019 F-Type that I custom ordered a couple of months ago to arrive during the December incentives. Ronnie Dempsey and Travis Downs took great car of me throughout the process and I couldn't be happier with the deal or the personal service I got.
This is a family-owned dealership and Autobahn does treat you like you're part of the family. ",5.0
34,"December 07, 2018",My F-Type is very special to me and so is the treatment I get when I have it serviced at Autobahn. Their service after the sale is first rate--just like their buying/leasing experience. ,5.0

36,"October 15, 2018","I took my car to be serviced for transmission to be flushed and a oil leak. After I came to get my car back there was scratch damage along the entire right side of my car and although they signed a responsibility form, they are giving me a very hard time about paying for responsibility. The Head manager at this place told me to have my lawyer to call him. I would not recommend anyone to go there. I emailed them a estimate from Jaguar Pereti but I'm still having problems getting paid for the damages. I even tried to work a deal with them and Matt told me to come back the next day. I came back and he wasn't even there to work the deal. They tried to give me a loaner car but with mile restrictions of sixty miles a day well I live in Louisiana. My city is 8.5 to 9 hrs away. I would have accepted the loaner car if the deal would have been right my only request was if I would take the loaner car that the would give me fuel vocher. I felt like that was fair considering that the damages to my car was caused by their mechanic and the supervisor admitted it. My question to him because he claimed not to know of the scratches how could you be a supervisor over the service department and not be aware of damages caused by your employee taking my car through a car wash . They don't care about professional service in my experience with them.",1.0

40,"September 07, 2018",Took my XF in for its 2 year annual service. I waited in the service lounge while they performed the service. After the service I went to leave and the car would not recognize the key fob.  It was getting late so Matt arranged for a loaner vehicle while they investigated the problem. The next morning I brought back my wife's fob for them to reprogram. They let me keep the loaner to use while they reprogrammed the fobs. When they completed the reprogramming they  contacted me and I picked up my car.,5.0

49,"June 20, 2018","Terrance and Autobahn were extremely easy to deal with on my purchase of a new F Type.  I tell my employees all the time, we need to be easy to do business with or customers will go elsewhere, Autobahn is a good example of easy to do business with.",5.0

52,"June 01, 2018","We were greeted as if we had been customers forever although it was the 1st time we visited the dealership. 
Terrence listened for what we wanted and provided the automobiles that matched our wants.
With a little back and forth we came to an agreement with in a week. Terrance also followed up with us throughout the time and after I wrote the check and drove off he helped me setup my in control app. 
We came to autobahn because the website indicated the best value for what we wanted was there but we also received great service. Although we visited another auto dealer in DFW, they never followed up, I guess because we were clear that we wanted value and had financing and could wait until the value was also there. Well their bad and Autobahns good.
I hope to be back in a year or two to purchase my preowned Velar.",4.8

I called with a service question and spoke to Matt.  During our conversation I discovered that the car had already passed its one year service date. It should have had its first service in September, the month after we bought it.

97,"May 07, 2017","Took ""Mick Jaguar"" ( my car's name) in for his 18k mile checkup. Service as usual met my expectations. Corey treats me as if I am the only customer in the house.",4.8
98,"April 11, 2017","I was greeted by Kory. He explained what this service would cover. I told him that one windshield wiper wasn't working. I also told him that I had been forced over and hit the curb. He said they would check for damage. Also the cover for the drivers side mirror had fallen off. When I returned to pick up car, Kory went over everything that had been done. I was pleased that there were no problems found and all concerns addressed. Once again I was pleased with service. ",5.0
99,"April 05, 2017","The dealership was very accommodating.  I brought my 2009 Jaguar in for the air bag recall.  So it wasn't a very important visit.  But, it was to them.  I had to drive in from Granbury and so they gave me a very beautiful Volvo SUV as a loaner.  The receptionist even took time to give me a short lesson on operating the various functions.  My car was ready when they said it would be.  When I arrived to pick it up, there it was --- beautiful.  They had taken extra care to be sure my car was washed and shiny.  It made me feel very special and I truly appreciate their extra effort on my behalf.",5.0
100,"April 01, 2017",Great car buying experience. Felt fair price. Would have been nicer to have more car options used and new to choose from but understand how expensive that would be to the dealership. ,4.8
101,"March 19, 2017","Overall, I was very happy with the service today. They took me quickly and had the loaner car ready. They finished the 2 year inspection and complied with two recalls and had the car ready in one day. Pretty good.
My only problem with Jaguar service is the expense. $31.28 for an oil filter and $34.53 for an air filter? Come on!! Give me a break!",4.4
102,"March 07, 2017","My service was quick and satisfactory. I dropped my car off in the morning and later that afternoon got a update call letting me know what the issue was and how it was repaired.  I picked my car up the next day fixed, serviced, and washed.  ",5.0
103,"March 04, 2017",Repair took a little longer than expected but I was kept informed of the progress. Not sure why Jaguar/LandRover does not have a national customer database so all dealerships would know what additional warranties were purchased with each vehicle.  It would sure expedite warranty work if they did.,4.4
104,"February 28, 2017",I was somewhat disappointed because the dealership did not have the warranty part.  I now have to take my Jag back a second time.  I live an hour away from the dealership.  I was told the manufacturer would not send the part until the dealer inspected my car.  Not customer friendly.,5.0
105,"February 28, 2017","DORY MADE SURE I GOT CHECKED IN, GOT AN ESTIMATE, AND SERVICE WAS COMPLETED to my satisfaction.  Victoria got me into a loaner car and walked me through the features and operation of the vehicle.",5.0
106,"February 20, 2017","Well, my husband initiated the conversation with the dealership, but I pick it up. I was very impressive how attentive and respectful they were toward me.  It was my first impression.",5.0
107,"February 18, 2017",I would like to thank Reed and Terrance for making this a seamless new car experience.  I saw the car online on a Monday I was contacted on Tuesday to give a day a time that I would be able to pick the car up.  The Manager of a Jaguar Dealership 45 minutes away could really learn a few things on how a Dealership should operate. Thanks Guys ,5.0

111,"June 21, 2016","I visited the Autobahn Motorcar Group for service to my Jaguar.  I dropped in the discuss what might be wrong and when they could schedule an appointment.  This was the first time I had been to this dealer.  I parked my car and walked in the front door.  There was no personnel in sight.  Surprise!  No salesperson approached to ask if I needed assistance.  I made my way through the building to locate the service area.  Once there, I noticed one female service writer visiting with a customer.  They continued to chat about various topics with the service writer glancing over at me periodically.  When she did finally walk over to me I could tell she was highly annoyed that I had interrupted her conversation.  She asked what I needed and I attempted to explain the difficulty I was having with the car.  The whole time I felt she was looking down her nose at me as if I wasn't worth her time of day.  I left with enough information to call and make an appointment, had I decided to deal with Autobahn, which I did not.  But before I left, I stopped to look at the cars they had for sale in the lot.  One in particular which I had seen advertised on the Internet.  I looked and looked a little more, walked around it and walked the other way, then glanced at the door to see if anyone was going to assist me.  No one ever did.  There was an employee walking into the adjacent building for another make (Audi I think) and I commented, ""I guess they don't need to sell any cars) and he kind of chuckled.  So, I guess you got your wish Autobahn.  You didn't appear to want or need my business, so I am happy to take it elsewhere.  Guess I'll go to your competitor over in Dallas.",1.0
