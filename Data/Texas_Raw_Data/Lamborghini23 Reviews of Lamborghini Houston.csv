9,"September 06, 2018","I bought a new Huracan RWD from Marvin at Lamborghini Houston. My entire experience from initially meeting Marvin to driving the incredible Huracan to dealing with Zack, the General Manager, to working with Maisa, the Finance Director was an exceptional experience. Even the mechanics, whose space I had to briefly invade to view my new Huracan were super nice.

14,"April 30, 2018","Lamborghini Houston did an excellent job of keeping me updated on the status of my service - Rachel called me daily regarding status of the ordered parts and what they had completed.  Additionally, the transport company they scheduled to pick up and return my car was a few minutes early both ways during the middle of rush hour (Galleria area).  I did not enjoy my sales experience with Lamborghini Houston when I was purchasing my SV (and ultimately decided to use a different dealership), but I would highly recommend Rachel in service.",5.0

20,"August 23, 2017","I have been going to Lamborghini of Houston (and their events) for many years now and am very pleased to have recently purchased a new Lamborghini from them.  The buying experience was quick and easy, and Raj worked to meet all my requests during and after the purchase.  Raj and the rest of the folks there are extremely knowledgeable about the product and very low pressure.  The dealership is also very active in the Lamborghini community, including cars and coffee events and the Lamborghini festival.  I highly recommend purchasing from Lamborghini of Houston and plan on doing so again myself! ",4.8
