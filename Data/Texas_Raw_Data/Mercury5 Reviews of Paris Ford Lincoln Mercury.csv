0,"May 26, 2020","The only reason this dealership get a 1 star is because they don't have negative stars. We came to an agreement on financing $23,000 a down payment of $8,000 with a trade in of $1,000 and monthly payments of $407 . Was told it's a done deal, took the truck home , switched insurance over from the trade in to the truck, said all we had to do was come back the next day to sign the paperwork. Came in the next day sit there for 8 hours just to be told they now want an extra $2,500 down and the payments were going to be $571 a month.  Needless to say I told them xxxx no . I  called the lending company to ask them why they approved us at an agreed upon price, just to find out this dealership was asking for 34 thousand and not the 23 thousand we agreed on and the dealership told them we were putting only $500 down, huge difference from the $8,000 we were putting down.  The General Manager ""Jeremy"" said he would make things right when I called him personally and explained what I found out they were doing. He lied to me for a week telling me he gives me his word he would do everything he had to do, so after calling him for a week ""he never called me during this time "" he lied and said a cylinder dropped in the engine when they moved it around the parking lot so they wasn't allowed to sale the truck because of that . After all that he never asked if he could find another truck that I'd be interested in,  just acted like they did nothing wrong and haven't heard from him since to say he's found a truck that I might be interested in.  I will never recommend this place to anyone, worst that I've been treated ",1.0
1,"October 14, 2018","So we been going up to the local Ford Dealership. Looking at new trucks. We have purchased. 4 trucks and 2 SUVs from this dealership. in the last 13 years. Today while we was looking a lady come on a loud speaker and said we are unauthorized to be on the property. Everyone goes and looks at what's new and in inventory on Sundays while they are closed its a open lot with no gates. Done this every time I thought about buying a new truck or car. The point is the lady was rude. Her tone of voice was as if we had committed a crime. I've never been made to feel that way in all my life. I will tell you this. Everyone I know Everyone I ever meet I will tell them how bad My wife and I was treated on 10/14/2018 The fact that I was in a SUV I purchased from this dealership when this happened  was simply pathetic on The dealerships part. I will be taking my $70,000 I was going to spend on a truck to another dealership. You can rest ashore me or any one i ever talk will never be on this lot again. Long as I live.",1.0
2,"January 30, 2017","Made an appointment to get an oil change.  Simple enough... Just an oil change.  It took them 90 minutes to do a 10 minute job. The service writer was rude when I asked for a status update on my car 
Never never never use that service center. They are a disgrace to the company name. ",1.6
3,"August 26, 2016",If they try and get or recommend. To get you finance with Santander. Don't do it.. it will be the worst thing you ever do in your life.  Nothing more than a predatory lender.  I have made 12 payments on time and all have been applied to the interest. Nothing to the principle. Will never purchase another auto form this place again. Never Ever. I have owned 12 ford autos. This will be my last. ,1.0
