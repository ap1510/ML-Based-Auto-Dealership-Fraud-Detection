0,"November 22, 2019","Simply unparalleled customer service and personal caring. Owner of a second KB cadillac and Im consistently amazed at their tremendous professional and competent service department.  

KB washed the under carriage of my XT5 after a skunky roadkill event.  Who does this!!??  No questions asked. Unbelievable. WOW.   

Im a customer for life. The ‘KB’ experience is vastly superior to any other Texas Cadillac dealership.  ",5.0
1,"October 19, 2017",I live in del rio and I spoke to Cameron and he was great over the phone and told me to go and he would pay for my gas if the deal wasn't made. I explained what I was trading in and what I owed. He said don't worry we will make it work and so my family and I left and we get there and even after he was texting me where I was etc. I get there and the first thing he says is let me get u someone else I'm busy with someone. So he passed me to lulu which she was great deal wasn't made and she filled my tank. I don't recommend this place unless u like to be lied to. ,1.0
2,"October 08, 2017","I have always received great customer service from the Ken Batchelor staff, from picking up my vehicles to returning them to my home.  They are outstanding!",5.0
3,"August 06, 2016","I DO NOT recommend this this place for repairs.

I took my car in for repairs to the front end and I was informed that it would be ready the same day.  Two days later my car is ready and I pick it.  

As I was driving the car out of the service center, I noticed that my steering wheel is no longer center aligned. As I got on the road and started driving home, I noticed that my car is now pulling to the left while driving.

I immediately called back and I let them know about the alignment.  I asked the service rep if they had performed a front end alignment after they replaced the front end suspension parts.  The service rep did not know for sure and he was going to call me back right away to let me know. 

Five days later and still no response from the service rep about the front end alignment.  On the 6th day of no response, I sent an email to the service center and I get a call back the next day stating that they would complete the alignment.  Finally they are going to perform the front end alignment that was supposed to be done at the time of repair.

Today, I drop off my car at the service center for the alignment.  Three hours later I get a call that the car has been repaired and is ready for pick up.  

All is well until I get my car back and I noticed a big crack on my front windshield on the passenger side.

I talked with Robert the service manager about the damage and he said that they were not responsible for the crack on my windshield and that they were not going to pay for it. In his opinion, he felt that they were not at fault for the damage.  How can they not be liable?

I explained to Robert that the crack was not there in the morning when I dropped off my car and it has been in their possession all this time and now when I go to pick it up there is a big crack on my windshield.

Again he said that there was nothing he could do about the damage to my vehicle. He told me to have my insurance pay for the repair.

Bottom line - how can a service center cause damage to your vehicle and not be responsible in repairing the damage they caused?

So, for these reasons, I will now have my vehicle serviced at another service center and I will NOT have any positive recommendations for Ken Batchelor Cadillac.

4,"July 27, 2016",Came in with a problem was treated very rudely and disrespectfully was made to feel like my Cadillac wasn't as good as other Cadillacs they were fixing because it wasn't a new model. Was even told that they couldn't believe that my car had broken down earlier and this is from the place that makes the cars and sells the cars Cadillac..... unbelievable! Never ever ever ever ever ever take your car here my whole engine blew up 2 days later after a routine oil change!,1.0
5,"November 04, 2014","They are outstanding! They worked with me on a title problem until the issue was resolved. They were fast, courteous, and professional. Hats off to Bryn Lopez who assisted me. Thanks!",5.0
6,"July 16, 2014","I dropped off my car without a hassle, I was quickly placed in a very nice loaner car, and the pick up went just as smoothly. Everyone there whom I spoke with were friendly and helpful. The employee who helped me was Ellyn, and she was extremely personable and efficient. Megan was very nice and helpful to get me into a nice loaner car. ",4.8
7,"October 26, 2012","Since I live halfway between San Antonio and Austin and was less than impressed with the Austin dealer, I decided to take my 2011 CTS-V to Batchelor for service.  At least in Austin they didn't try to blatantly rip me off like at Batchelor:  trying to charge me over $100 more per tire than I can get at Discount Tire, telling me that a 1 1/2 month old tire with less than 2,000 miles was worn down. Never again Batchelor.",1.0
8,"June 14, 2012","I took in a brand new car, bought at their dealership with only 3,000 miles, for two issues. Neither issue was fixed, as the tech was ""unable to duplicate"" the problems. I've come to expect this level of service from Chevrolet, but not from Cadillac. I will now be trading my new car for a BMW M3, I've always bought American but if Cadillac can't do any better than this I'll be a foreign car owner.",3.0
9,"March 22, 2012","I did all my business with Cory over the phone.
Drove down on Friday from Fort Worth and they had the paperwork and the car ready to go when we arrived. 
They even stayed over cause we were running late.
Best car buying experience I have ever had.
I am very happy with my car and the no stress of making the deal was so worth the drive!!
Thanks

10,"January 17, 2012",Leonard was an exceptional example of how customer service should be performed. Very accommodating!!!  I believe that this particular gentleman certainly deserves a raise.... I'll be back !!! My little girl will need a used car in the near future...... : ))),5.0
11,"January 15, 2012","I write this review to commend the aboveds individuals for their outstanding job performance that led to my purchase of six pre-owned vehicles from KB Cadillac over the past few years. Wayne is the most congenial and knowledgable salesperson I have ever dealt with. Always helpful, he has come to my reidence twice to program the garage door opener which requires climbing a ladder which I am unable to do. Sherri is super and has provided all the information to enable me to make the best options and finance decisions. Kristin in service consistently ensures my vehicle is in tiptop condition. I also wish to commend Floyd Collins in emergency service as he has come to my aid on a few occasions. 

In summary, it is always a great pleasure to visit KB Cadillac.  The entire staff is
is always courteous, friendly and those little chocolate thingy's are delicious.

12,"January 15, 2012","Ric Griffin provides excellent customer service. My family's been dealing with Ric for over 20 years ( formerly @ Cavender Cadillac).  Ric is the most personable man we know.  Ric truly cares about his customers & treats you like your his only customer.  His attention to detail is impeccable & it's truly a pleasure working with him.  Ric will go out of his way to put you at ease & is always extremely accomodating, confident & optimistic- this is why I made the change from Cavender Cadillac to Ken Batchelor.  Ric Griffin is truly a gem & Ken Batchlor is very lucky to have him on their team.-Cynthia Carr",5.0
13,"January 14, 2012","I live in Atlanta Georgia, and searching the internet for a previously owned Certified Cadillac EXT, I spoke with Leonard Young at Ken Batchelor Cadillac. I reviewed the car, the offer, and agreed to purchase, and flew to San Antonio. Leonard picked me up at the Airport, and offered me the most gracious Texas hospitality. I can not imagine a better internet shopping experience. I highly recommend Leonard and Ken Batchelor Cadillac",5.0
14,"August 17, 2011","I have given the rating above because as follows: I am 71 years old and in my adult-hood, I have encountered a number of auto sales teams around the country. The two persons that I have named here categorically stand out because of their overall dedication to sound principles of customer satisfaction. They made each of my visits to Ken Batchelor an enjoyable and successful experience. Their attention to detail, every time, set a standard that, I am convinced, would be difficult if not impossible to match by others in their field.

They reflect great credit on their employer for hiring and retaining such ultimate professionals in their high tempo and competitive field. Without a doubt, these young professional are worthy praise at the highest levels. You should promote them to key positions, in Ken Batchelor, in which they will contact every customer that enters your campus and they should teach others the fine art of customer satisfaction.

Directly because of the, I would give even a higher rating if at all possible.

Thank You,

15,"July 14, 2011",I have already purchased three pre-owned vehicles from Ernie and have always been well taken care of and treated with honesty and integrity. Would highly recommend Ken Batchelor to anyone in the market for a new or used vehicle.,5.0
16,"July 07, 2011",I have always been impressed with the friendliness and quality of work performed at this dealership. Robert Fleming and Michael Del Greco always go above and beyond my expectations.  There are so many people at this dealership who always make me feel that they are really glad that I chose Ken Batchelor - that really goes a long way with me.  I recommend them to all of my friends.,5.0
17,"July 06, 2011",I have purchased many vehicles from this dealership and this sales person and they really do go above and beyond to help you with your decision and purchase. I have sent many friends also to this salesperson and dealership that experienced the same excellent help. ,5.0
18,"June 30, 2011","Lulu met us in the parking lot with a smile and handshake.  Within minutes she had collected sufficient information to help us find the perfect used vehicle.  Lulu brought us to her office, offered soda, water, lemonaid and made sure we were comfortable out of the near 100 deg outdoor heat.  She apparently had already begun putting together some recommendations in her head because a few key strokes on her computer brought up 3 vehicles that closely matched our desires.  Guided by her recommendations we selected a gorgeous 2008 DTS Cadillac, test drove it and bought it.  The mileage and price were both low and the vehicle condition and features were excellent.  My wife and I always start every trip out of the house with prayer for a successful venture and we believe God guided us to Ken Bachelor to meet a wonderful lady who had the perfect vehicle for us.  The whole experience was absolutely perfect.  Thank you, Lulu.",5.0
19,"June 29, 2011","My Husband and I have been looking for a change in vehicle for about 2 months.  We found what we thought might be the ""one"" but during the test drive, we actually found it sitting in the lot.  By this time, it was way later that closing time, but Mari said ""I am here for you"" and stayed till all paperwork was finished, put my ""new"" car in the sold lot and assured me that it would be there for me.  So Cecil called at noon the next day and said ""When do you want your car?"" I went at 3 pm, Mari took me around showing all the shops and waiting rooms, then introduced me to one of the service managers. You could not have asked for a better dealership.  Paperwork was so quick. Signed, sealed, and ready to go in about 30 minutes.  Mari then showed me all that my car could do.  Since then  barely one week later,  she has called twice to be sure I am happy.  Even ordered me the care book that goes with the car.  Thanks to Mari and the team at Ken Batchelor Cadillac, my ""new"" car shopping experience was awesome!  Dee Ditmore",5.0
20,"June 22, 2011","Bought a new 2011 CTS coupe performance cadillac from Ken Batchelor in San Antonio. The dealership is fantastic from the sales person Alejandro Jacobo to Sheri Foster Director of finance and insurance. Alejandro Jacobo my sales rep. you can't beat this man cause he knows his business and he does not pressure you he's very friendly and knowledgeable. By the time Mr. Alejandro Jacobo gets done then you visit Ms Sheri Foster finance and she's a sweet heart she goes over everything thorough and for me to catch everything she said the first time, I did it's a miracle. I hope both of them stay cause Ken Batchelor is my dealership from now on. I will give the dealership a 10 star rating if they had it so I guess a 5 star have to do.

21,"June 17, 2010","I have bought two used cars from Ken Batchelor Cadillac.  

Both times (2005 and 2010) I have dealt with top-notch, friendly, knowledgeable employees that did what they promised and took care of my concerns.  

This dealership has elevated the car buying experience to what it should be for all dealers in the San Antonio-South Texas area.  Unfortunately, many dealerships fall far, far short of what they should be or could be.  

Ester and Rick were both great.  Their finance people were fast, informed and professional.  The cars I bought (Buick Park Avenue in 2005 and Cadillac Deville in 2010) have both been dependable, enjoyable and very reliable.  

If you find two cars you like and one of them is for sale at KB Cadiilac, go with KB!",5.0
