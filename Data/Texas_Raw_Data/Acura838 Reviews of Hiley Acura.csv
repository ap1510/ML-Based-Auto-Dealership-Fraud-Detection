0,"December 18, 2019","I purchased an pre owned vehicle from the dealership in which was an lemon. My salesman James Haas was not very helpful during the purchase process ,his customer service was horrible. The starter went out on the vehicle two days after purchased. Within the next few days I noticed the vehicle started running hot and the heater stopped working. I took the vehicle to an repair auto shop an was advised the vehicle needed an radiator and thermostat. I spoke with manager Scott Vo who advised to bring the vehicle back out there to have it checked out. I took the vehicle back out to the dealership and which it stayed at the dealership for one week and I was told the vehicle only needed for the coolant to be flushed. So I went to pick up the vehicle and noticed the same issue vehicle running hot and no heater. The service department did nothing at all to make sure that my vehicle was truly repaired before returning the vehicle.  I then took the vehicle back to the repair shop and had the radiator and thermostat replaced and was told by the auto shop stop leak was added to the vehicle. The stop leak added to my vehicle prior to the purchase has totally messed up my vehicle. I have called and requested to speak with an General manager several times with no return call. I will not be recommending this dealership in the future. Do not purchase an vehicle from this dealership. The entire experience has been absolutely horrible. ",1.0

2,"November 17, 2019","Oh how I wish I could give 0 stars. This place is utter garbage. They lie straight to your face, they use every shady sales practice in the used car sales book, and specifically Eric is a terrible person. He sold a car right out from under me while I was on my way to buy it just because he would get the sale faster, even though I was promised it was on hold after giving them my debit card info to put a deposit down on the vehicle. Do not give this place the time of day much less your business. They are crooked and disgusting. Their ineptitude knows no bounds.",1.0
3,"September 30, 2019","Probably the worst car buying experience we‚Äôve had so far. Used car sale and finance were time consuming and honesty was out the window. 

Also, we came from out of state to buy the car and was told after a whole month of waiting for the paperwork, it would take 4-6 weeks! Completely out of the norm here. My state only allow 30 days to register or late fees will apply. Left messages asking for a return call on this matter and got nothing. ",1.5
4,"August 23, 2019",I purchased a vehicle in Dec. 2017. I experience issues with the turbo charger. I took the vehicle for warranty repairs in Sept. 2018 and it was returned in February of 2019. I reported an oil leak to Hiley on the newly installed engine hat Hiley replaced due to a mechanics error; I returned the vehicle for repairs and four months later I still don't have mr vehicle. The service department will not take my calls. They just ignore me. I would not advise anyone to do business with Hiley. ,1.4
5,"August 22, 2019",I had a great experience with Amanda she was so knowledgeable and very patient with me! She was will to go the extra mile to help me find my dream car! I would recommend her and the dealership to anyone i know! Best experience everüòçüòçüòçüòçüòç,5.0
6,"June 30, 2019",Worst waste of time buying experience ever. They refused to let me take the vehicle to be inspected by my mechanic until I signed all the final paperwork to purchase it. Unbelievable! I was told they would let me out of the deal if my mechanic found problems. When I asked them to sign a document to back up what they said... they refused. Ended up walking away from the deal. Buyers beware.,1.0
7,"June 02, 2019",Totally liar and dishonesty. They have agreed with the OTD price but turned 360 degree on the next day. I almost purchase the car at the other dealer and they text me nonstop and asked me to give them a chance to beat other dealer.....,1.0
8,"May 13, 2019","I considered purchasing a new car from Hiley Acura but ended up purchasing from someone else.  I got lots of emails from them and have clicked the 'unsubscribe' button multiple times but they don't seem to actually honor these unsubscribe links.  

I just received this email from Austin Doyle today.  Apparently he is super professional and will have a long career in sales:

***************

Frank, 

I see you opened my 'please take 10 seconds to respond' email and then...didn't respond. Making the world a better place one read email at a time! 

***************

If you want sales teams that full-on harass you, then yes, spend time with these guys.  I spent a LOT of money at another dealership and won't even consider them in the future.   ",1.0
9,"April 10, 2019","I would NEVER buy from Hiley Acura again. Purchased a used vehicle on December 31. We were told that it would be ready in a few days to pickup. It was over a MONTH later that we were able to pick up the car. It was not even close to having all of the items completed. Since the dealership is an hour away, I was told that I could take it that day and call them in a week or so to bring it back in to have the rest of the items completed. Seeing how I had already been waiting a month for my car, I took that day. BIG mistake. My husband and I have been calling, texting, and emailing every person that we can at Hiley with NO response or ""so and so will contact you in just a minute."" Recently, they said they weren't even sure if they would still be fixing the rest of the items. That we would need to pay for some of the repairs that were promised at purchase. I STILL don't have my license or registration. They won't even schedule for us to come pick them up. Again, it's an HOUR away, so I don't want to drive an hour there and back to not be able to get anything. DO NOT BUY FROM HILEY ACURA!!!!!",1.4
10,"March 21, 2019","So I purchased a 2015 TLX from this location, i soon started to notice a couple of stuff that weren‚Äôt really noticeable  at the lot. Chipped paint, chipped plastic, I shrugged it off and said my fault for not looking and it‚Äôs a used car. BUT they add an incredibly high fee to ensure the car comes out the lot in good conditions and that includes oil and filters. Fast forwarding 2 months later when I‚Äôm getting ready to do my first oil change, I noticed the filters and oil were in terrible conditions and hadn‚Äôt been changed In a very long time. They charged me a $1,500+ fee for nothing. They did nothing to my car. They Make your car look good enough to drive off the lot and care about nothing else. I‚Äôve tried to reach out and no answer . Don‚Äôt come to this location",1.6
11,"March 13, 2019","I bought this vehicle about a week and half ago. It seemed solid at the dealership. So far no serious problems with the engine, drive train, etc., BUT....I've begun to realize that a great number of plastic pieces on the vehicle were broken that weren't obvious on the lot. For example, a Mopar air intake had been installed by the previous owners. 

What was not obvious at the time I bought it was that the previous owner had managed to break the plastic clip that holds the air temperature intake circuit. It was just hanging there. I found this out because my check engine light came on and, after looking into it, found that it had come unplugged. Simple fix, but annoying. The hood prop clip that holds the bar in place - broken. On the driver's side, under the dashboard, the plug you use to pull codes had its bracket that holds it in place broken. Interior door trim - now falling off. ""After market black matte wheels"" turned out to be plastidipped. Again, so far (and I pray to The Lord above it's ONLY these minor things) nothing crippling to the vehicle, but pricey by the time you fix it all. Hiley Acura service department will not return calls. 

If you are determined to buy from them then be absolutely sure you pull, prod, tug, and even kick the tires. I know it's a used vehicle, but I've never purchased a pre-owned before that had so many pieces falling off. Those things have always been fixed prior to sale.  I won't come back to these guys. ",2.6
12,"February 17, 2019","This dealership has access to more technology to effectively communicate with their clients than what we used to send men to the moon, yet, somehow its management encouraging the use of sales tactics from 1995 when car buying was done through local paper magazine ads. We saw a vehicle posted for sale, called at 9:30 on Saturday morning when dealership opened and were told ""I see it in front of our office and it is current for sale"". Our drive to dealership is just under 1 hour, during which I sent a message to our sales associate 20 minutes before our arrival - to which the associated replied ""Sounds great, let me know when you are here"". Upon our arrival, vehicle was on the lot with Texas Buyers Tag attached to it, dating 2 days prior. Classic bait and switch.

I guess there is a reason for 4 out 5 stars overall rank for a dealership representing a global Acrua brand. I don't fault the sales associate here. So, to sales management in pre-owned department - congratulations. Just remember, in the age of the internet your lot becomes a second choice. ",1.8

14,"October 24, 2018","Recently visited to look at a truck
There asking almost 5 grand above nada clean retail. 
Truck is far from clean
Roof has a lot of hail damaged
Previous own clearly had dogs chewed up back doors 
Seat belts etc 
You could tell it was just dirty inside 
They did what they could to clean but still dirty dark carpet in all cracks. 
Truck needed shocks 
Missing rear tailpipe 
Needs front ball joints. 
Had a check engine light on that they were unsure if it wa a fixed or not
Reset computer by disconnecting batteries. 

A dealership that doesn‚Äôt quite care what the true value is of a vehicle 
They just seem to come up with there own price. 

Sales person aundre was awesome 
As well and the service manager 
She was great

The upper management seems to be where the issues come from ",2.8
15,"August 11, 2018","Brought my Ford F150 to the Hiley Acura Service Dept (north Fort Worth) for a rear brake job - they service all makes & models.  Was greeted by Michael Phan and we discussed - wrote-up the work needed for the brake job.  Michael was up-front about the cost for the job - no surprises here.  Told him I planned on leaving it till the next day to give them plenty of time.  To my surprise, Michael called later the same day to tell me the work was complete!  I swear they must have an Indy Pit Crew working behind the scene!  I picked my truck up the next day and everything was perfect!  5-Star service all the way!  ",5.0
16,"August 06, 2018","Went to Hiley Acura of Fort Worth today to look at a used vehicle they had listed on their website under the pre-owned inventory section.  The web site was easy to navigate and had all the vehicle info listed.  Upon arrival I was greeted by Mike Nguyen at the pre-owned car center.  Mike brought the vehicle over from the service center and we took a short test drive.  Mike handled everything from there, from negotiating price with his manager to working with the service dept to answer questions and check on mechanical issues and arrange for some needed corrective maintenance. From there it was over to see Jacob Rogers in the Finance dept to complete the paperwork and discuss the various warranty options.  This was so easy - one of the most enjoyable car buying experiences I've ever had (and I've had more than a few over the decades).  These guys are Pro's, fast, polite, friendly and they get things done for you right away!  5-Stars all the way!!!!!+++++",5.0
17,"July 28, 2018","Since it has been a long time that we have purchased a vehicle, our sales rep AND the owner even stepped in to help out successfully!! They definitely tried their best working with us and our situation! We left super happy and in the vehicle we wanted! Since we purchased so late, we had to come back for a detailed wash... this was the only part that was disappointing as their detailed car clean was basic to nothing. Finance also managed to completely mess up the payment arrangement however they worked diligently to correct and were super helpful! Loved our sales rep Joy Green!! She genuinely showed her careness and only wanted us to be happy!! ",4.2
18,"July 06, 2018",Great people! They care to make their customers happy even after you purchase the car. Easy to deal with andthe purchasing process took longer than I expected but overall happy with them ,4.4
19,"June 27, 2018","People may forget what you‚Äôve said, may forget what you did but people never forget how you made them feel.  I had the privilege of meeting and doing business with Michael Nguyen, a salesperson at Hiley Acura, for my vehicle purchase.   He made my car buying experience exceptional.  He listened to my concerns, provided excellent customer service and went above and beyond to make sure I was treated well and fairly.   There was a vehicle at another dealer that I could have bought.  But I had such a good experience with Michael Nguyen that it resulted in Hiley Acura getting my business.  If you are in the market for a new or used car, be it an Acura or some other model, DEFINITELY ask for Michael Nguyen at Hiley Acura!  ",5.0
20,"June 15, 2018",Michael Nguyen was a great salesman very nice and approachable from the time I walked in. I haven‚Äôt had the best experience with cars in the past and was almost positive I was pressing my luck coming here. He reassured me that they could work with me which they did. I appreciate the ends Michael went through to help me get financed!,4.6
21,"June 08, 2018",Working with Jim in sales have been an extremely pleasure. This was the 4th dealership I was trying to buy from while out of state (I live near Chicago.) Jim was very direct but friendly on the phone and was willing to work with me mostly via text and email to get this deal done. They were more than accommodating to my banks delays and have made buying this car an absolute pleasure.  Highly recommended. Thanks again!!,5.0

26,"April 26, 2018","Where to start. 
I took my car into MCA on Saturday, April 14, 2018, for an oil change.
No one acknowledged that I was even there for a good 10 minutes. One guy was on the phone and proceeded to let me know that! Finally a guy came over to help. Michael L. asked if I had the ""Master Plan"" and I didn't know. He rudely asked me if I had ever paid for an oil change there. He told me that I could wait in the waiting area but I left the car there so obviously I wasn't in a rush as it was only 1:00 PM and I was told on the phone that they closed at 5:00. 
 I told them that I was having problems with a tire losing air pressure. Not a problem, they would look into that too. 
They called within an hour saying my car was ready. On my paperwork it stated that they had changed my oil AND rotated my tires. 
They didn't find anything wrong with my tire but if I continued to have problems I could just call them back. 
Monday, April 16, 2018, I got in my car to go to work and my tire had lost air pressure. BUT the tire in question was still in the location that I was previously having problems so obviously they did NOT rotate my tires as indicated on my paperwork. Now I'm wondering if the even changed the oil? I have called several times with no response. I even called Jennifer H. the customer relations manager, and still have not received a response. I have now contacted Acura Customer Care and filed a complaint with the BBB. 
This is the 3rd car that I have purchased at Mac Churchill and will be the last. The first car that I bought was a used Volvo but found out that it had been wrecked (not disclosed at purchase). Second car was a lease to get out from under the Volvo that I was upside down in. Third car (shame on me!) was a purchase because my lease was up and I really liked the Acura ILX. From the moment I signed the papers, I had trouble with the salesperson contacting me. I had left my CD's in my old car and they were ""looking for them"" and would never get back with me. I finally wrote those off as lost. I have NO trust in them anymore. Enough is enough. They truly do not care about the customer and their investment. 
I know MC from Jewel CB and he probably has no clue how bad they are treating people. He will when I run into him again.",1.0
27,"March 23, 2018",Eric Glover did an excellent job and was very patient with us.  My wife drove up from Houston and he helped her the entire time.  His customer service skills were excellent per my wife.  A long wait for finance was her only complaint ,5.0

I didn't believe it. I arrived and was greeted warmly by Austin Doyle, my lease specialist. He showed me all the new features on the 2018 (Apple Carplay, yes!) on the test drive, then sat me down and within 10 minutes had a price proposal that actually LOWERED my pay payments.

51,"December 30, 2017","I walked in on a weekday morning and was met with a smile by a young man (I'm 61, so he seemed young to me) name Austin Doyle. We was pleasant, fast, and didn't give me the whole 'sales pitch' run around I so often dread. We talked about what I was looking for, he gave me some options, I picked the one I felt had the most value for me, and then went and got the car in the lot. He presented it, answered all my questions, and let me drive it till my heart was content. And that all happened in under an hour! This is why I never go when the crowd goes, on Saturday. We went back and forth a couple times but the negotiations were relatively short compared to most. And after finance he sat in the car with me for 20 minutes showing me how to work all the tech; pairing my phone, putting my home address in the NAV, and showing me how to alter all the vehicle settings.

I called before leaving the next day morning to make sure the car was still available as I was driving a long way. I took the day off and went there and was told that the car was no longer available. The manager told me that someone reserved the car, they should have at least the common sense to have told me that was the case so I could have saved a drive and not waste my time taking the day off. At the very least, they could have told me to make a deposit if that is how they operate. They advertise something online and then when you go there tell you that it is no longer available.

We took the car on a test drive and I really liked everything about it, except I felt it was a little overpriced based on my research, which I told him.  He asked me what I would like to pay and he told me he would do his best.  I told him I would finance the car through my Credit Union, as they had already preapproved me for 2.49% for up to 5 years.

When we returned to the dealership, he went into the ""manager's pit"" (A room with glass windows but a door so of course you can see them but not hear them)  The managers are behind a tall bartop looking thing - looking down on all of the shoppers.  I'm sure there's some psychological reason why some dealerships do this.  After about 15 minutes, the sales associate comes out with a sheet full of numbers - I examined this closely, and found that not only had they not reduced the price at all, but there was an additional fee of $1800 for ""vehicle restoration"" WHAT???  Every other time I have purchased a car these kinds of fees are included in the price.

The sales associate asked me what my monthly budget is.  I told him I didn't really have one, the most important thing to me was that we get closer to my offer price.  He insisted on getting a number I told him $450 for 60 months, which was $50 less per month than they ""full price"" monthly payment option they had as a suggested payment.  Closer to 20-25 minutes goes by, my sales associate has disappeared, but when I saw him outside the dealership walking around I approached him to ask him what was taking so long.  He apologized and headed back into the managers den and came back out with a new sheet.  He smiled and said ""Great news, we got you down to the payment you requested!""  I took a look at the sheet and realized instantly they had not only not reduced the price or removed the fee - they just extended the payments out to 72 months.  Essentially adding another $2400 to their bottom line from the first time!  What a joke.

I told the sales associate that I wasn't pleased and that I had another appt at another dealership.  I got up to leave and he said ""let me get my manager""  I continued walking out to my car.  As I was getting in I heard my name and sure enough the sales associate and manager were walking briskly towards me.  He introduced himself as the manager who was ""working the numbers""  I told him how I felt that was a cheap move and I liked the car but they would have to get closer to $25k.  He said, what if I can get you $26.5k? Would you do it then?  I thought about it for a minute, and agreed to his offer.  He said, ""Ok, I'll be right back""  I told him he had 10 minutes before I had to leave to see the other car, but if he came back with a sales contract, I would sign it.  

After another 15 minutes, the sales associate came back out with a frustrated look on his face.  He told me the manager sent him out to tell me they wouldn't do any less than $28k on the car plus the restoration fees.  I thanked him, and left to go see the other car where I had a MUCH better experience.

I feel really bad for the sales guy who I'm sure is commissions only.  He really tried hard and was really friendly.  That's the reason for the one star.  Based upon my experience with manager and the ""process"" I will NEVER buy a car from this dealership.",1.3

65,"October 27, 2017","I can't begin to express my satisfaction with this dealership, one of the key people that led to my beyond amazing experience was Jim Haas. He kept in touch with me daily, after somehow, winding up with an ""online credit qualification"" that I had filled out for another dealership, and told me I had been approved for a loan through them, dispite the fact that I had horrible credit. He kept working with me, going back and forth trying to negotiate something I could afford, while trying to work with my bad credit, in just my name, so I could rebuild my credit, while helping me to get a good car to fit my needs. He was successful, along with Lawrence the business mgr. and Izzy, who all worked tirelessly on my behalf. They never gave up on me, and I am extremely thankful and grateful.

They put their load meter on and said sure enough the battery had a dead cell.  They suggested to take it to the dealer, that it might be under warranty.  ""Big Mistake.""  I set up an appointment for 8:00 in the morning.  They suggested replacing filters, transmission fluid, brake fluid and a tire rotation for nearly $800.  Of course I said xxxx No!  They told me initially that they didn't find anything wrong with the battery.  I called them out on it and they said they could run a load test.  Of course they found that the battery was bad and that it was under warranty and they would replace it.  After 2 1/2 hours (what should have been 30 minutes max.) I left fuming.  Of course the Assistant Service Manager apologized and said it should have only taken 1 1/2 hour max.  I told him I could change one in less than 10 minutes.  He said it was for the paper work.

81,"August 02, 2017","I called in about a car I saw on their website yesterday. I spoke with a rep who said his name was ""Taco"" Mendez. He seemed nice, as they always do at this stage.

He confirmed that the car was still available and I told him I had challenged credit and thus would not be making the trip to the dealership without a pre-approval. He repeated my request back to me, and I confirmed that I'd already done the financing app on the website. He asked me to send him a picture of my ID, which I did, then he said ""let me go to work for you and I'll be back in touch."" I supplemented my ID with several other identity and address-verifying documents via email. I also included my proof of income, bank statements, etc.

Heard from him after closing. He said ""we have a way to go"" on financing. I set an appointment for the next morning (today), but texted the salesman letting him know I had some questions before coming all the way to dealership. It's 30 miles from my house. I told him I needed a ballpark on financing terms before coming all the way to the dealership given its distance from my house. This information is something other dealerships have gladly provided so as not to waste either party's time. He says his finance manager won't contact any banks without me being there.

Let's just say they're unprofessional. Though I conceded that my credit was bad when I first called in, they thought they could leverage that into getting me into the dealership before discussing any terms. Which is ridiculous considering they've already dinged my credit with a hard inquiry! 

To paint the peacock, when I texted the rep that I was already on my way to a dealership much closer to my house, he (like a high school girl) responded, ""Ok good luck.""

I'm convinced the positive reviews on here are people that were paid or are family members of the sales reps. These guys are trash. Will stick to dealerships rated 4-stars and up on Google.",1.2

Don pressed me to make an offer on one on the lot so it did.  He did not pass it on the the sales manager (Mr. Brooks) so when I was presented with a purchase agreement, there was no indication that my offer was relayed.  Further, the price of the truck on the sales agreement was now $6,000 higher than advertised .  Outrageous considering Mr. Brooks convinced me to come back after the truck wouldn't start for a test drive saying he would 'make me a deal' in light of the failure.  Bait and switch.  I walked away.  Two weeks later the same truck is still listed everywhere (Cars.com, Autotrader.com, and their own website) but now FOR THE PRICE I OFFERED.  I went to them to initiate the sale the day after the price was changed but was told it was sold two days prior.  In essence the price was changed but the truck was not on the lot any more and they had no intention of selling it at the advertised price.  That is Fraud!

93,"June 13, 2017","I drove over 350 miles to MacChurchill to buy a used vehicle. I talked with Bryant over the phone several times about the vehicle, confirmed its availability and that it would not be sold before I arrived. I was repeatedly assured that the vehicle was waiting on me and I didn't need to do anything further. When we arrived for our appointment (after getting up at 3am and driving), we were informed that Bryant had called in and the vehicle had been sold the night before. No one had called to inform us of the vehicle's sale. I was highly disappointed in the lack of professionalism displayed overall at the dealership. I was repeatedly told that ""these things happen"", which I can understand to a degree. In my opinion, basic courtesy would be to extend a phone call to inform someone that the car has sold (especially if they were driving 350 miles to buy the car). It was also slightly shady that Bryant was ""running late"" and then ""called in sick"" to our scheduled appointment...especially considering the circumstances. I really do understand that people have life occurrences, but overall it left a bad taste in my mouth for the dealership and the sales staff.  

Joseph Trinh was the salesman who was initially taking care of us when we arrived , and he was very nice and apologetic. He tried very hard to find us a vehicle that was comparable, but ultimately they were not able to do so. I negotiated with 4 different managers, but in the end they were unable to match prices of other dealerships.

6 months ago I traded my fully loaded 2008 MDX for a 2015 RDX with 8,000 miles. Throughout the test drive and entire shopping experience I was told over and over that it was basically a new car. True. With less than 10,000 miles it was a very new car even if it was 2 years old.
I bought the car and they detailed it, filled it with gas and sent me in my way.
Fast forward 6 months....I am at Discount Tire for a tire rotation. The service rep met me at my car. He was looking at the tires and said ""Did you know these are 2012 tires?"" They were not even the tires that were on the car when I test drove it.
Not only were they the wrong year, they were almost bald!
While sitting in the waiting room at Discount Tires getting new tires I wrote this review.
Then I went home and called Mac Churchill. I spoke with David Wynn who said he would need to speak with his Director. 
A few days went by and I called back and asked for the Director Mike Mata.
Mike was WONDERFUL! 
he was kind and genuine and I felt he was also surprised that this happened. 
He asked me to text him my invoice and within a week Mac Churchill covered the cost of the tires.
I must admit I did not expect this outcome. My original review was 1 star but after seeing the way Mike responded - clearly they deserve at least 4 stars!

135,"January 12, 2017","After having my oil changed by a third party it was brought to my attention that some grease had been leaking from the boot/CV joint. Being that this was a new car that is still under warranty I took it to Mac Churchill to have them look into the issue further. 

I was told that whatever had caused damage to my vehicle would not be covered under warranty that that it would run approximately $340 plus tax and disposal cost. Believing that I was being told the truth I agreed to have my car worked on. This was on a Wednesday afternoon and I was told that the part would have to be shipped overnight to arrive on Thursday. Once the part arrived it would be a quick fix and I would have the car sometime late Friday morning. On Thursday afternoon about 3:30pm I stopped by the service center to grab some items I had left in my car. At this time I was once again told that the part would be in any minute and the car would be repaired the next morning.

Friday morning I called my service advisor three times on his direct line and he did not return my calls. Finally around 3pm I called the service center's main line to have me transferred. The advisor picked up immediately in which he decided to inform me that the part was on back-order and would not arrive for approximately one month.  

I was not given a straight answer as to why it took multiple phone calls and several hours after my completion time to be told the part was on back-order. The advisor should have known it was on back order the second the part was ordered. 

Due to this deception I took my car to another Acura Service Center in DFW. After they looked at my vehicle they confirmed the part on back order but happened to bring up that the issue with the vehicle was 100% covered under warranty. 

Some might say that such a deception borders on flat out thievery.

140,"December 30, 2016","I have only written a few reviews in my life and tend to be positive but this was a HORRIBLE experience!!!! My wife did not want to go with me to look at cars any more after this experience which says a lot! She used to get her car inspected there. NOT ANY MORE! 
 I went in to look at a car a while back and they asked what my budget was. I said 10-11k but if it was exactly what I wanted then I might could do 13k. The salesman said I think I have just what you would like, a 2015 Corolla with all the bells and whistles and low miles. I asked how much it was and the guy said $13,000 something but dont worry it will be in budget.
I test drove the car to pick up my wife at their suggestion and liked it so they ran the #s for me and the car was over 15k? I asked why it was not 13 like he said and he could not give me a straight answer and had his manager come over. The manager was condescending, ignoring the salesmans statements of it being 13k (maybe that was the negotiable price but they did not start there). 
The manager finally started trying to negotiate a price lower and wanted to run my credit. I told them I didnt want them to run my credit and that I knew it was over 700 and would be fine. The manger said if I put in my info and social security (which I should have not done) they could do a soft pull that would not affect my credit or show up on reports. I asked again and he said I promise. Next day I looked and sure enough a hard pull is on my credit for the next 2 years. That was a manager that blatantly lied! 
We tried to leave and he kept trying to make a sale and got more condescending acting like I was being stupid and mean to them for not buying from them and that I should ""work with them on the price"". If he was honest, upfront and serving my needs instead of his own and got me that car at 13k  I would have been happy but I told him that I had options and didnt have to use him. 
They offered me a horrible value on my truck to top it off when they were suppose to be giving ""top value""that day. I also heard their sales pitch to multiple people while there.
Another manager texted after I left wondering what was wrong. I said that their managers are lieing and he He said they would make me
They ask you what your monthly budget is and then ask if you could budge just a little bit to get a better car. Same pitch every time to get you to spend more instead of meet your needs and stay in budget. Go somewhere else and save your money. My brother had a horrible experience as well which I found out after the fact.

Then‚Ä¶ he came back and said oh, I made a mistake, the rebate was from a previous purchase. I was extremely irritated. So, I need to either come up with $6500.00 or roll it over to the new car. I was irritated but then he hit me with, oh,and I forgot to add your negative equity into the deal I presented you. 

We went from a very decent deal to him trying to screw us. I liked the car but it has some issues. Holes in the dash and console from some kind of radar system. Plus some minor paint issues. Before the test drive the car wouldn‚Äôt start. During the test drive the touch screen LCD would blackout and the windshield wipers came on randomly. Even with all that they wanted to add $16,500.00 to the deal.

Concerned about the distance the dealership was from our home, the salesman lied and  told us that all Honda dealers were certified to do warranty work on Acura's. Absolutely untrue.  The sales director purposely kept my drivers license so I would have to return to the dealership again. While we looked at a car, 4-5 sales people surrounded us. It was by far the worst place I have been shopping for a car. Stay away from these deceptive, high pressure sales people.

187,"August 29, 2016","At 9 months pregnant on bed rest I requested quotes online for the vehicle we were looking for before making our way out to a dealership to finalize.  I spoke with Bruce Phillips at least 3 times to confirm the price quoted and the details, leaving no ambiguity to chance.  I also asked for this to be a fast process as I was to be on bed rest but we wanted to finish the car buying before delivery. He would not provide a written quote due to concern with another dealer matching it that would have been closer to us in Dallas.  Fair I understand the logic. 
Trekked our way to the dealership for a 3 pm appointment, Bruce confirmed our price again but then handed us off to another representative at 4, until then we were just waiting.  Mike Weide took us on a test drive then sat us down for pricing.  The price quoted was no where found on the sheet (not even the subtotal), Mike told us Bruce must have misunderstood what out the door pricing means (really?).  We went back and forth and were able to get the subtotal to the price we initially were quoted for ""out of the door"".  Mike guaranteed us we would not find a better deal anywhere, actually laughed when we said we had a better deal from other dealerships who clearly understand what out the door means, he guaranteed us there was ""no way"" as he is the fleet manager (this is not on his business card).  So 3.5 hours later we left with a business card with a hand written quote on the back.   Same day we got the deal we had told Mike we had at another Acura dealer, WITH the add-ons Mike was trying to charge for.  I have never been so disappointed in a car buying process, this is my 3rd new car purchase.  It is unfortunate how little trust you can put in some people, the dealership where we ended up purchasing was honest, accommodating and extremely helpful so all is not lost.  Mac Churchill however has some customer service issues they need to work on if you compare their reviews on yelp. google and dealer rater compared to the other Acura dealers.  Take heed.",1.2

200,"July 27, 2016","DO NOT buy from this dealer they lie about everything. They will tell you that you need a warranty and maintenance package because the bank won't finance it without it. That's a flat out lie. Then once they sell you on this they will sell you the wrong package and use the wrong oil in your car and tell you it's right. Costly repairs that they will over charge you for also. Bottom line if you want to be treated like an idiot when you point out the facts that they think you're unaware of and you want to be forced to purchase warranties that are useless and wind up causing more harm than help by all means waste your money here. Also they're overall customer service is the worse among any dealers I've ever visited, even worse than those buy here pay here lots.

Bought a car with bad tires but they passed the state inspection, 2 front tires literally had about 7-8 inches bubble on the side wall, in addition the O2 Sensor was bad and again they did the inspection and passed it. I just hope someone from the State Dept. reads this.

I was told by them to come and trade the car, because of the issue, I have been there 5 times with my 4 years old, but can't come to a deal because they have started to quote me 2-3k higher than the market place and tell me that they bought it expensive so can't sell it low. 

Bunch of liar - even the directors. The finance manager also confirmed that the vehicle is in factory warranty. Mike and Ali are another 2 people that you want to stay away. I shortlisted the car and asked them to finalize it for me they said we are not making enough $$$$$ on that car so we do not want to sell you that specific car.

225,"June 15, 2016","I will start with the fact that Justin Kerr is the ONLY positive I encountered at Mac Churchill when trying to purchase a 2016 Acura.  I finally had enough of their management team and purchased my TLX from a competitor.

The level of unprofessionalism displayed by senior management at Mac Churchill (MC) Acura is truly unbelievable. They have instilled a culture of deception in their sales team and I warn anyone using this dealership to do their due diligence prior to signing a contract. In reading the other reviews, many share my concerns and have been burned or misled by the MC team. 
On my initial call, I informed the ‚ÄúInternet Manager‚Äù that I had a bid from Carmax but I did not care if I traded the car or sold it directly to Carmax as it was a lease and I would receive no tax savings. They told me they could compete with Carmax so I gave them a chance since they had the car & Price I was looking for (so I thought). 
Upon reaching the dealership I was presented with a purchase order for the 2016 ILX with $1,693 in ‚ÄúDealer Adds‚Äù that sell for $900.25 in the MC Acura Parts Dept (Verified 6/15/16). Dealer adds were never mentioned on the phone so you can understand my surprise.
We finally settled on a price and I agreed to eat a little on my trade for the convenience. Unfortunately after waiting 30 minutes for finance, I was informed by the sales manager that the car I chose was a dealer trade and not released it in the system by the other dealership so I could not sign until the next day.  
The next morning, another Acura dealership called me with a great price on a 2016 TLX.  I called MC and offered them first right of refusal and they agreed to match the price. I informed MC during both calls that the quoted price did not include a military rebate of $750. Upon arriving at MC, I was told that the car selected that matched my requirements had $2100 in Dealer Adds but they had a second TLX with espresso interior instead of ebony, they could offer at the quoted price. As it was already 4:00, I agreed to the change and went inside to sign. I was again offered a purchase order with dealer adds (This time it was only $498) and a price that missed the competitor by $750. I immediately told my sales rep and he went to management with my concerns. They came back and asked me for my Carmax trade offer. This was the third time they asked for it and I could not understand why they needed to see it when I clearly told them that I did not care if I traded the car or not and that they could easily remove my trade from the deal. I NEVER asked them to increase their initial bid for my car. The manager stated that the general manager would not move on price and that if I wanted the price offered by the competitor and agreed to by MC, that I would have to buy it at the other dealership. I voiced my disgust for MC wasting five hours of my time and left the dealership. Within minutes of departing MC and on my way to Carmax to get an updated offer, my sales rep called to ask if I was planning on selling my car to Carmax and if so, he could come and pick me up and bring me back to MC to purchase the TLX. I asked if they would honor the additional $750 and was told no.  A few minutes later, he called back and stated that they would honor the deal as promised with the additional $750 without my trade.  I told him I would work with Carmax and let him know if I was still willing to buy a car from MC.
Upon receiving a second offer from Carmax, I called Vandergriff Acura and talked to the Sales Manager. I informed him I was at Carmax to sell my car and would pick up the TLX in the morning if he would honor the price he emailed me earlier. Without hesitation, he told me he would beat Carmax and I was welcome to head to the dealership to purchase the TLX as agreed to via email. I arrived at Vandergriff Acura where I found the exact vehicle requested in the front row, cleaned and ready for delivery. I was greeted by the sales manager Roger who informed me that Andy would walk me through the purchase process. While filling out the credit application, I received the purchase order with NO DEALER ADDS, at the exact price we discussed, and with a trade offer that beat Carmax. I mentioned I was retired military and they simply asked for a copy of my Retiree Account Statement (RAS) so they could add it to the deal. Within minutes of providing my RAS, I received a new PO reducing my monthly payment by $26.
I cannot tell you how different the culture is at these two dealerships. The Vandergriff staff was upfront and professional with every customer I observed during the ninety minutes it took me to purchase the TLX.  Every Vandergriff team member greeted me in passing and appeared to take pride in their work. To see this, in contrast to the deception and unprofessionalism delivered by the MC staff, clearly illustrated the vast cultural difference of the two dealerships. 
If you are looking for a new Acura, I highly recommend you use one of the three Acura dealerships other than MC in the DFW Metroplex, any of which will treat you with more respect than the staff at MC. Feel free to read other posts which further illustrate the acidic culture at MC Acura. If you give MC a chance on your next vehicle purchase, I implore you to walk in to the dealership prepared for the worst.

246,"May 04, 2016","Overall a good experience. 
When we showed up we were greeted by David Diamond. He was very friendly and showed us around the exact car that we found online. When we sat down to talk numbers i thought the whole process went fairly quickly (at other dealerships we felt like the salesmen and other management staff wasted a lot of our time going back into the sales office and then came out with an answer or counter offer. They would be back there 20-30min at a time for several times) I felt like David made this process run smoothly and efficiently. He respected that we wanted to pay cash, respected our budget and respected that we were only their to look at that one car. I also liked the way the numbers were presented for the car and sales price during the negotiating. The breakout was simple to read and understand. As we negotiated this was updated. (At several other dealerships we visited we had found a car online at a particular price, went in to look at it and then when the sales person presented us the numbers it was significantly higher than the price listed online and we could never clearly follow or understand how they were coming up with that final number) We were happy with the negotiating phase at Mac. We also never felt pressured by David, he was happy to allow us to talk and think it over. When we walked out of there we felt like we got a fair deal. 
My one complaint is i did think it took to long to get into the finance office and finalize the paperwork/payment. I felt like we waited way to long. 
Overall a good experience and i would gladly buy another vehicle from Mac and David Diamond again. I plan on recommending both.

The car was not in my possession it was still being worked on (why would I want a car paying more money and is not in A-1 condition.

258,"April 16, 2016","Visited  this dealership on Saturday April 16 as a result of the airbag recall. I was given the option of getting another vehicle or a rental with a was scheduled appointment for 3pm when i received the call from Mac Churchill on Wednesday April 13. When i got there, i was asked what my preference would be, buying another car and getting the FMV on my old car or a rental car. I opted for the rental and that was when i was told the rental car services closed at 2pm and as such could not get a rental. I am very frustrated with Mac Churchil for not being upfront and letting me know the hours of the rental before confirming my appointment for 3pm. I had to drive a long distance to make it to this 3pm appointment and make significant adjustments to my schedule only to be told to there isnt nothing that can be done but for me to return the next day if i want a rental. The sales person just left me there unattend after i expressed my concerns about having to make that long communte again. He told me he was going to be back but never showed up. Basically i drove out there and was to told to come back the next day with zero service offered. 

This made me feel t i was not given full disclosure on the timing for services. I was never told a 3pm appointment for a recalled part on my vehicle would mean i would not get a rental that day and a waste of my time and safety to drive to fort worth, tx. I felt deceived, lied to and treated poorly and unjust. I felt the whole intent was to get me to buy another vehicle and was not provided the appropriate customer service.

I am concerned i cant trust the services and the people at Mac Churchill. I take my car there for servicing but i am very concerned i will be lied to and have reconsidered taking my car to another dealership.Loyalty, trust and integrity is something i value a lot and that i why i chose to deal with Mac Churchill each time i need services inspite of the distance but with this experience, i have come to learn that isn't so. Time is of the essence and if the intent was for me to buy a car instead of a rental, i can appreciate it if my time is not wasted. Time is of essence, cannot be regained. No amount of money can equate to trustworthiness.",2.0

Arrived 12:00pm and was told we needed to drive to the back lot to see it. Car had sticker in window ""car cannot be sold"". The exterior was filthy, panel damage, interior was filthy, trash in every compartment, seats torn up,... The description on their ad ""You can tell this 2001 Infiniti I30 has been pampered by the fact that it has less than 176,460 miles and appears with a showroom shine..."" They said it just hasn't been cleaned up yet. I asked to test drive it but they said ""they didn't have the key"" (they never intended for me to want to test drive it). Since I drove 1 hour to see it I insisted to start the motor. Waited for them to return with key but battery was dead. waited for them to get a battery jumper car engine would not start. They continued to try to convince me to upgrade to a more expensive car. I asked for them to try another battery, then was told they could not sell the car anyway because it wouldn't pass emissions test.

This was clearly a scam to lure people into the dealership with low priced cars that are falsely advertised to be a clean, good running car. I informed dealer management of the problem but I was brushed off (manager was rude and said ""they sell 100's of cars a day and the car I was looking at 20 other people that day were interested in purchasing it...

I have been at a lot of dealerships the day before looking for a suitable vehicle for my family the other dealerships were high pressuring me.Which it made me very uncomfortable cuz I also had my children with me and they were getting tired and hungry from the amount of hours that we were spending trying to find a vehicle. Your dealership and salesman were no pressure take your time look around and if you need me I'm here to answer any questions that you may have. Mr Diamond also saw that my children were getting a little bit fussy with each other so he  told me that the dealership had a play area for the little kids which made it a little easier on my husband and myself to focus on the vehicle.

I was there all day and little did I know that after doing the review the salesman that would not let us go allday would start avoiding us as we waited to recive the car. Sure he showed it to us raised in the air getting the"" final touches"" before we could have it but as time went on he saw us waiting an hour later but said nothing. Nick saved them from a horrible review. When he saw us still there he went and found out what was going on with the car. It needed new tires before they could release it less then 30 minutes later Nick had me in a loner on my way home for the weekend tires come in today. Because of this experience I'll come back and deal with Nick. I gusse the other guy would still have had me spend the weekend up there.

322,"February 03, 2016","I have been searching for a Particular make an model of a car for a few months (  Hyundai Genesis Coupe 3.8 Track edition ) With plans to make a purchase in the next few months however my previous car decided it was time to go and kind of ( luckily ;)  ) forced me to amp up my search for a new vehicle.  This dealership luckily had what I was looking for and for a fair market price. I found the vehicle searching on Cars. com

I called and was quickly put on the phone with Jason Sauer. He confirmed the car was on the lot and allowed me to schedule a test drive. Through life circumstances I had to reschedule and even showed up late on my re-scheduled time.which was very close to closing. Jason was very patient with us and did not seem a bit upset that we showed up late for a test drive near closing..I felt he  could think we were potentially wasting his time, as I told him that I was not going to go through the buying process this evening, I had my kid with me and he was tired/hungry.  But he assured me that this is fine and was happy to help us with looking at the car...Through the test drive Jason was very knowledgeable of the features the car had.  Knowing the make and model I obviously wanted I could tell he had done his home work to be able to answer any question I had.  Most cases you see sales men have a general knowledge of the vehicle he is selling but Jason knew intimate knowledge about this particular vehicle. I gave me confidence in him as a seller. 

After the test drive I went back into the dealership with him and was approached by his manager. Wanting to make a deal. I explained not tonight but in all likely hood because of Jason Sauer I would be back . 

Before the test drive I found the exact same car with similar mileage and price at another dealer ship. I entertained going there Saturday, but because of the experience I had.I decided to go ahead and go to back to Mac Churchill with the intent on buying.  

The buying experience was similar to what you can expect at any dealership, I came prepared to haggle an talk about price etc etc. Jason had to go to his Sales Manager on any deals for approval. I also Had to work with his Manager Mike Brooks going back and forth on the price. 

After the final sales price and trade in value was agreed upon. I felt comfortable signing the paper work.   

Over all the first contact to the signing of the papers went as expected. I was however very pleased to have worked with Jason Sauer during the process. He made us feel comfortable and confident in our decision to make a purchase at Mac Chuchill,... 

 The sales portion of this entire process went well I had made my purchase and was satisfied on the price I paid.  After the fact going  to finance office was the only portion of he entire process that was complete unpleasant. 

Working with Mike Luong he was there to go over our paper work and have me sign over the other car etc etc.. During this process he began to tell us about the extended warranty, I wasn't interested but Mike Kept on insisting I should sign up.  needless to say I was getting angry about having to tell him no so many times and was ready to leave.  The problem is you think you are done with the whole sales /haggling process and you let your guard down. Then they try to pressure you in to buying an extended warranty. I said no 12 different times. The last time I raised my voice and he still tried to get in one more ""are you sure"" I was ready to walk out on the whole deal, get my trade in back and leave.  However I think I sense my Frustration (FINALLY) and quickly processed my Paper work.  

Cliff Notes: 
Over all experience was good. It would have been the best if not for Mike Loung... Jason Sauer and the rest of the sales team that assisted me were top notch . ",4.0

Everyone's knowledge, work ethic and attitude made me so thrilled to have gone to this dealership first. They listen to your needs and genuinely desire to assist and serve you through the entire process. Moreover, I can tell you from personal experience, the high level of service doesn't end after the buying process is over. Bruce, Joe, Tommy and Amber all continued to provide stellar support after the papers were signed and the cars were delivered-- each one of them really went the extra mile-- this must be part of the mission statement at this dealership because they were all onboard! I kept expecting something to go wrong but we drove away with the feeling that we made great purchases. My wife and I are very thankful to have had Bruce and the guys assist us with purchasing both the MDX and TLX. Bruce, Tommy, Joe, Amber and everyone involved made it an experience that I truly appreciate and that's saying a lot because I typically don't like the car buying process. However, they changed all that-- we shall certainly be back and we are absolutely Mac Churchill Acura customers for life! Thanks again, folks!

They guy first lit a cig right in front of us (I despise smoking) and then just kept leaving and was no where to be found!  Once we finally found the car we wanted (took hours because we kept having to hunt down the salesman) the negotiation took just as long. CASH people, there was no reason for the delay. They kept trying to get us to finance - NO NO NO!!!  We got up and left after a couple of hours of going back in forth, the sales manager caught us outside and said they would give us free oil changes on the car for a year and lifetime car washes for the family if we did the deal. Deal. 2 hours later we final closed. The car washes are a joke - I took my car in once, won't waste my time on that again, they don't clean the inside and the outside didn't look better at all!

He told me vehicle is ready for test drive and he offered financing options. After he took my name and other information he went inside and came out after 10 min with his Crook Manager who cannot even lie lol!
He came in and tried to convince me to buy another vehicle as this was sold on satuarday and they already received  their money which was a big lie. I asked him if the vehicle was still on the premises .He said that the new owner was getting is serviced . for fender bender issues..""""""FENDER BENDERS???""""

 LOL what a blunt lie and the sob was not even hiding the fact that he was lying..that is this sales person ALI  meanwhile the other sales person clearly had this on his face that i am not playing and going along with your lies ALI cos i have more decency and am ex military. and not dishonest like you.
I was like oh man good lord what are they teaching these managers or is he just born like that to lie so much...scammer.

They'd already swipe our card for down payment and took our check to hold for 3 days and made it hard on us to get that number changed.

342,"November 25, 2015","i had always heard good things about this place through a couple of my investor friends who used to swear by this place so my expectations were big to begin with

I went to this place for the first time early November 2015, my car had gotten flooded and i was in the market for an M3 and they had one available. This was a red convertible, they have had for a while, I reached out through Cars.com, wanted to come in for a test drive. A sales person named Robbie, responded to me, I scheduled a test drive, but informed him that I was on a short schedule since I had a test the next day and would like to see what i can do in the short time period. Robbie had other commitments, i got assigned to another sales guy who turned out to be quite nice, we did our drive. I pointed out a couple of issues i found with the car, that needed to be fixed, and then we came to the numbers game, I was on a short time span, so offered them 36K for the vehicle, I got introduced to one of the sales managers, Mr. Brooks, who after the salesman's pitch and discussions with a whole cabin full of managers came back and offered to sell the Vehicle to me for 37K. I was still not sure about the vehicle and a couple of other reasons, so i decided to leave the offer on the table and left. 

I was out of town for a couple of weeks, got back in town decided to make the purchase, reached out to the dealership and got a hold of Brooks, informed him, I was willing to pay him the 37K he asked for. He told me, to come back towards the end of the month.

On 11/24, I was able to get out of work early, decided to swing by the dealership and make the purchase. In my mind, I had already talked to a Sales manger about this and this was going to be a smooth breeze, walking in paying for the car and driving out. 

Again, reached out made an appointment at the dealership. Robbie shot me a text informed me he would be waiting for me outside. I drive in and while am getting to the dealership, a swarm of sales people stop me and ask me if i have an appointment or not, i said i did, and i drive into the parking lot and Robbie was waiting for me.

Exchanged formalities, he informed me that, he has been reassigned to a new "" High Performance team"" and that he has a new manager, Jason Reed who would be doing the deal now. I told him, I have come back for the deal that his original manager had offered me and that is the number i am willing to pay.

He was like, lets go ahead talk to him and we will go from there. I wanted to drive the vehicle again and he informed me that, the vehicle has been classified as a show room vehicle and that I wouldn't be able to drive it without putting money down on it, it struck me as weird, but since i had already made up my mind about buying it, I was okay to proceed with it.

Jason comes over, introduces himself, and i give him the basic information, I told him, i am back for the offer that the original manager and I had negotiated with. He told me, yes, let me go put together the numbers and we will go from there. He goes back and after about 15-20 minutes, comes back with a sales sheet, showing a whole bunch of numbers starting from when the car was listed 6 months back. I informed him, I do not have time to negotiate, I am here to buy the car for the number that was discussed. He gives his whole nine yards about how the numbers sales mangers give out are "" What If"" scenarios. As in, they throw out numbers after 15-20 minutes of discussions inside the managers cabin, to see if customers would stay for that number. 

In the end, i reiterated ( for the umpteenth) time, I am not here to negotiate, i value your time as well as my time, please let me know if you are going to do this or not. He again goes back to the managers cabin and comes back in another 15 minutes with a bunch of car listings, for crying out loud, I don't care to see what prices other cars are listed for, If i wanted to do that, i would have looked them up myself, again he tries to do the same spiel of how awesome their pricing is, again i revert to my stand"" Dude, i do not have time to negotiate"". This time he goes back to and sends Robbie out to say, we do not have a deal.

He could have said that 3 hours back when i showed up to the dealership. No he wasted my time, with the whole sales spiel when i informed him from the beginning that i am here for an agreed upon deal:

Moral of the story;:

Go to this dealership if,

1) you love haggling with a bunch of dressed up crummies, who throw out ""What If numbers""
2) be swarmed by sales people the moment you walk in.
3) A bunch of high priced vehicles that have sat around for ages.
4) A ""high performance"" sales team that does not know the basics of customer service.
5) Managers in cabins who apparently never honors the numbers which took them 15 minutes to come up with.

In all, just look around here, do your due diligence and stay clear of this place.",1.0

They will do or say whatever it takes to make that happen even if that involves a lie or two. I can tell you get EVERYTHING in writing and even then it may not be enough. Also, be prepared for the $400-500 bump after the deal is signed. I don't mean in the Finance Department or to get your financing approved, I mean after you sign the purchase order and they decide they didn't make enough money. Here's a tip, say NO, that sends them into a panic. I was promised two new tires on the front of the car I purchased but what they replaced them with was worse then what was on there to begin with. Their excuse, we didn't say ""NEW"" tires we said ""different tires."" Also be aware of the additional service contract they sell that may or may not be honored by the company they represent. The service company sent me a letter saying it wasn't valid but Churchill claims to have fixed it and the confusion was there are two different contracts. Strangely, Hopefully I will never need it, after their previous lies I doubt the contract is even valid. If you have the same problem, go to the dealership, the lady in charge of warranties apparently doesn't know how to work a phone. What's really sad, I would have paid more to buy from a reputable, customer oriented, honest dealer. I thought that's who I was dealing with and didn't find out the truth until it was too late. This is the type of dealer that gives other used car dealers a bad name. I would be very skeptical of the good reviews on this site, check Yelp for more accurate rating and use extreme caution!!!! One other tip, watch out for the vultures (aka sales reps) when you pull in the lot. They will literally run in front of your car to make you stop.

My sales person (Jason/Trent) were great.  I spent 2 days and 11 hours of car hunting at this dealership.  I looked at 1 car and it sold 10 minutes after I said I didn't want it, I thought it was strange but I continued to search.  

I then watched a customer drive off and come back 30 minutes later yelling for his vehicle back; he was told that it was SOLD, I thought that was also strange.  

I Found another car, worked the deal but couldn't agree on price so I decided to pass.  The next day I get a call and they got the price right so I go in after work sign all the papers, moved everything out of my vehicle into the new vehicle.  On the drive home the car shook and made loud road noise at 60-70 MPH, I turned around and drove back to the dealership to turn the car in. 

After asking for my down payment back and being told ""accounting went home"" I became angry.  I was then berated by the sales manager and his minions, who reassured me that he was losing $2000 on my deal. ",2.0

I called to schedule an appointment with the service department on Thursday, October 22nd and was assigned to Lionel Valdez. I told him the issues I was having with my 2009 Acura TSX and he scheduled me an appointment for the very same day!  He also had me a loaner car reserved and ready to go, so I didn't have to wait long at all.  

Once my car's inspection report was ready, I received a text from Lionel, detailing the issues along with the cost! This allowed me a chance to see an itemized list of costs and pick and choose the services I wanted, prior to calling Lionel to discuss. (I thought that was pretty cool.

Lionel was very helpful in explaining the recommended services and going over my options.

362,"October 15, 2015","I bought a used vehicle from this dealership Saturday. Tuesday it broke down. The radiator was cracked, so I had to replace that and the thermostat. Today is Thursday. I now have to get the fan replaced because the car keeps overheating, won't blow cold air, and the oil light keeps coming on. 

The dealership made a big deal about buying the car ""As Is."" 

Okay. 

Luckily, I spent less than what I had budgeted for a cash car and I in no way expected perfection from a used vehicle. I also, however, did not expect to have spent close to a grand on repairs in less than a week of owning it. 

I contacted customer service and was offered a $100 service voucher as if I would EVER return to this place. According to them there's no way they could have known this would happen. And they spent ""quite a bit of money"" preparing it for sale. So I'm supposed to believe the radiator magically cracked a few days after purchase and they had no clue about all the other issues this car has?

371,"September 21, 2015","First off let me start by saying that I love my new car... after having to get around 1900$ worth of repairs on the car after only having it for around 30 days. 
Luckily I purchased the Master Tech warranty but had I not I would have had a vehicle that I couldn't drive. They lured me in with promises of refinancing my vehicle only to make me feel like it was completely unreasonable to finance. I took the bait. Ultimately they found a car that would fit my budget and waxed it up so nice that I didn't see the little dents on nearly every door, trunk and roof of the thing. The salesman did not mention them or point them out to me at any point during the buying experience and they were difficult to see on my silver car in the height of the afternoon. I asked the salesman about all the warning and maintenance lights that were on in the vehicle and he said ""Oh, all the Fords are like that you can take it to a Ford dealership and they might be able to turn them off"". Fast Forward 37ish days and my power steering goes out. Take it back to the dealership and the service department keeps it for 3 days only to call me and tell me that they cant do a thing for me, ""Take it to Ford"" they say. Ford has the vehicle for 12 days and performs just around 1900$ in repairs or more. My only question is.... they claimed to have done a 51+ point inspection on the vehicle before selling it, how could you have missed a faulty steering column, malfunctioning rear assist and other computer issues? If you in fact inspect how did these problems that a computer diagnostic quickly uncovered go unnoticed? BEWARE BUYER",1.4

377,"July 28, 2015","I am pleased to recommend the 3 people who helped us get into the vehicle we desired considering I had read over the many negative reviews prior to calling the dealership. I was very hesitant (especially driving 1.5-2 hours) but was pleasantly surprised and can strongly recommend, Thai Nguyen, Brant Rodriguez, and David Nguyen.  I told Thai where we needed to be and he spent 1-2 days working on it for me, he just about matched a competitor‚Äôs rate and got us at $183 a month as our target was $175! Thai really went the extra mile for us. We arrived around 6pm and walked out the door a little before 8pm.  All in all to be expected with their volume and lot size.

Brant was very professional and courteous as were Thai and David. Brant did initial paperwork and test drive, was not like a typical car salesman which was great! David was in finance and was very understanding when we had to regretfully decline extended warranty. He did not keep pushing; he just drew up the paperwork and was still kind even though we had to pass on the extras.
While waiting the kids played in a play room and they offered the kids cold drinks which was very thoughtful.

We did have to leave without a hard copy of the final sale because the banks were closed at that point but we were promised by Thai and the team that there would be no problem. So, we walked out of there only $8 away from our goal within 1.5-2 hours. Update: The rate and monthly payment were indeed what we were promised, same rate and $11 away from our monthly target.

We do wish we could have received the previous owners contact information to find out more about the vehicle (especially since it didn't come with any books) but we realize that doesn‚Äôt always happen for security reasons, so no worries, for the lack of overall information on the cars personal history (not Carfax) I would have honestly taken away half a point but that's not an option.

We are about to go on a 12 hour trip and will update with how the vehicle runs since we have only put maybe 200 miles on it, it was promised a multi point inspection to make sure all was good so we look forward to see how it runs.

Thank you again Thai, Brant and David.

Sincerely,

The Hilbrands

379,"July 23, 2015","My father and I located a 2003 Porsche 911 online for sale at Mac Churchill Acura. We discussed details of the car with Francis, he was helpful sent pictures and kept us in the loop.  Upon booking travel and arriving in Ft Worth with cashiers check in hand to pay for car.  We were tried to talk into financing.  Once we saw the car, things were broken on the car that were clearly not broken in the pictures sent to us 2 days prior.  This obviously occurred in clean up.  We pointed them out to he sales people and was told they would work it out.   We stayed he night and returned to the dealer the next morning to finish the deal.  They allowed us to take the car to the local Porsche dealer to get it checked.  Everything on the car was good except needing a new battery, this one kept dying and would not allow us to make the drive home.  Porsche told us the battery was under warranty and the dealer should replace it.   Once we arrived back a dealership and negotiated a deal for them to replace the battery and we would purchase and be on our way.   They took the car back to replace the battery and in turn put a small Honda battery in the car instead of the one meant for the car.  This battery didn't even allow the cover to fit back on it.  If we would not have check we would have never known.   Then when we went back inside to talk about it.  They told us , the hey had already lost money on the car and could not help us.  But it was in writing that the battery was to be replaced correctly.   Sales mgmt never came out of their office to discuss.  Never came to shake a hand, never apologized.  Instead laughed when our sales person went to them to try and make the deal right.    I know they make money on financing and we were paying cash,  I also know they sell 400 cars per month and this dealt meant nothing to them.  But, you do not treat customers this way ever.

Mr. Nguyen who handled the finance paperwork did his part of the deal quickly and with no nonsense.  Wish all the other guys were like him.

The Bad:  The sales manager and closing guys jerked me around and took forever. Part of the deal was 4 free oil changes.  After doing the paperwork, I asked and asked for something with that in writing--they gave me a coupon for a year of free oil changes.  Uh, guys, I don't drive enough miles in a year to make 4 oil changes, but I guess that's just too bad.

THE UGLY!  AFTER the deal was signed and sealed and funded, I had to wait 20-30 minutes and ask several times to find the sales rep so I could get the keys to my car and get out of there.  (Note--PLURAL keys)  

When I finally found him, he gave me ONLY ONE key!  Really, guys?  Had I known this, I would have negotiated another $200 off the price or walked away. 

BUT after emailing Mac Churchill, and after a few weeks, they did resolve this to my satisfaction.  To compensate me for the expense of making a second key, they comped me some oil changes.  It's too bad the sales staff would not handle this, but it was eventually taken care of.

388,"May 08, 2015","My husband and I purchased a used 2008 GMC Yukon Denali. Although the salesmen we worked with were helpful while trying to get our business, but when problems arose there's no help. We do realize that there are certain risks involved when purchasing an ""as is"" vehicle, but we felt that we were dealing with a reputable business who would do everything they could to ensure the quality of the vehicle being sold. The first week, the low tire pressure notification came on. Also, we were told that they could only find one key and didn't know where the other one was. My husband went back to the dealership (an hour away) and let them know about the tire pressure and asked about the keys. He was told the tire was fine, and given a key FOB. It didn't work. The salesman told him that he could take it to any dealership and get it programmed. My husband also told them that there were a couple of buttons on the dash that weren't working. He was told that he bought the car as is and there was nothing they could do for us, but he could go through his warranty to get it fixed. It's been three weeks and we have had to shell out money for a brand new tire because the one on the truck we found out had THREE HOLES in it, 2 of which had previously been patched. There is also an infestation of ants in the center console that crawl out whenever we put a drink in the cupholder and crawl into our infant son's car seat---I've filmed them crawling. Third, we took the key FOB to another GMC dealer who informed us that it didn't even go to the make of our vehicle and therefore couldn't be programmed and so we would have to purchase 2 new keys costing over $300. We put down about $3000 for this truck, and have had to put out additional money in less than a month of having it. Like I said, certain risks are associated with a used car purchase, but some things should be taken care of by the dealership---like making sure the tires don't have holes in them when you sell it to a family with three children and that there shouldn't be a bug infestation---and then refuse to do anything about it like give us some of the money back that we've had to put out. Lastly, after speaking to the general manager about all of this 2 days ago, he 'went to go look for the key' and hasn't called me back since then.

After test driving a 2011 Acura TSX we started negotiations to buy the car. After some back and forth we left an offer on the table for our top price (well within the range of acceptable price for this car) plus asking the dealer to provide tint and all-season floor mats. The dealer didn‚Äôt respond to our offer. Instead, Eric tried to show us a 2011 TSX with a huge dent in the trunk and that smelled of cigarette smoke. We left. There were 70+ other TSXs in our area with the same technology and fewer miles, so we called around and talked to other dealers.

Brooks (the manager) called us on Saturday morning wanting to deal. He made another counter offer still including the car having tint and the floor mats we asked for. We chatted and agreed to talk after we honored our commitment to go look at the other dealer‚Äôs cars. Brooks made a big deal about how he liked that we wanted to be straightforward with the other dealer. He said that integrity was important to him.

 After talking it over we agreed that we liked the car at Mac Churchill best so we called them. Brooks and my husband agreed on the terms, a price of approximately 3% below the internet price INCLUDING window tint for and all-weather floor mats. We provided a credit card to lock in the deal on the car. 

We went back to the dealership that afternoon, cashiers check in hand to cover the cost of the car plus TT&L. They were completely unprepared to finalize this deal. They finally brought out paperwork that left off the tint and floor mats. We asked Eric and Brooks to write it all down and they hesitated and disappeared to the back. Then new sales guy Chris comes to escort us back to the finance office to sign the papers. We waited there for another 30-40 minutes. The tint and mats were not noted in the paperwork and we were told that was a deal that was made with the sales guys and wouldn't be noted. We also asked for paperwork on the Acura Certified Pre-Owned program and the finance manager told him that he would have to call Acura in a week to verify the cars status with the program.  

We should have walked out right then, but Mac Churchill stresses ‚Äú‚Ä¶ he truly understands that when your name is on the building, your reputation is on the line."" They had also repeatedly stressed integrity and being men of their word throughout this process so we trusted that they would live up to their end of our deal.

We signed the paperwork and were handed keys. That was it. We chased down Eric for the dealers tags and to check that the tires had been aired up. He said they were. We asked him to write down the tint and mat agreement which he did on the back of a business card. We got home and my husband checked the tires with a gauge himself, aired up all 4 tires and the sensors shut off.  We also took the battery for a recharge so it would have a full charge and start the car without issues.  Both things the dealer should have done.     

Three days of chasing Eric down and we got the window tint scheduled. The service was horrible. They ran late and were unprepared and rude. The tint job was good. But instead of all-season floor mats someone had just stacked another set of fabric floor mats over our existing mats. Eric happened to stop by the service center to pay for the tint job. Unknown to us the management at Mac Churchill required their salespeople to cover the cost of the tint out of their own pocket. When asked about the all-weather floor mats Eric was irate saying that would be ""another few hundred bucks out of his pocket.""  

Eric said, ""That must be a deal you made with Brooks. You need to take that up with him. I am already losing enough of my own money on this deal.‚Äù

My husband said, ‚ÄúI am not concerned about who provides or pays for the floor mats so don‚Äôt try to make that my issue. The deal I made is with Mac Churchill Acura.""  He went to look for Brooks, but he was out of the office and was promised a call back on Saturday that never came.

We called Mac Churchill Acura and when we finally got Brooks on the phone, he proceeded to deny that he had made the deal for the all-season floor mats, just floor mats. He stated that he would never offer ""$500"" floor mats. The floor mats don't cost $500. The retail cost is $134.00. Brooks continued to deny that he had made the deal and continued to refuse to supply the agreed upon all-weather floor mats. He accused us of lying and saying that he would have never agreed to such a deal. He finally said that he would have to take the deal to his boss and see if he would agree. My husband ended the conversation by telling Brooks that we expected a call back from Mike Hamud, Tony Hamud, or Sharbel Lattouf by the end of the day Saturday.

As of this post we are still waiting.   ",2.0

But they did do everything they could to get us in something else. We ended up leaving with a 2013 ford focus. My husband and I are pleased to say they did help us out a lot by switching us vehicles, but just makes sure that there has been an engine check on a vehicle before buying it. Either than that they are very friendly willing to work with any kind of down payments and they are realist in weather or not you can afford the car you want or not.  ",4.0

Like many other reviewers here, our experience can only be described accurately by the word horrific.  Everything that could be done wrong was done wrong including them misleading us on the actual sales price of the vehicle by $3,500. When asked the sales price of the vehicle the ""back office manager"", pointed to the finance line of the contract and stated this is what your paying. Leading us to believe that the vehicle was being sold to us at a fair price.  It was not until we later reviewed the paperwork did we realize that was the finance price, not the sales price.

That was only the beginning of the misinformation and false promises fed to us by this pack of crooks.  During the deal negotiation we were promised a key fob for the vehicle that we were purchasing. We expected a ""we owe"" document but having purchased dozens of vehicles and only a few times were things this trivial documented, we took them at their word (bad mistake with this group).  

This vehicle was delivered with a brand new inspection sticker and no check engine light glowing so a reasonable person would assume that signing an ""as is"" contract would be no big deal.  Wrong, on the trip home from the dealership we felt that the vehicle was shifting hard and it was sometimes near impossible to put the vehicle in park. We suspected a transmission issue but almost all major drive train components will illuminate the ""check engine light"" if they have an issue!  After a couple of days of fighting the vehicle we finally took it to a neighborhood auto shop and they plugged in a code reader, the vehicle had not one but three major codes, after looking them up online we discovered that each and every one of them would illuminate the check engine light.  In discussions with the mechanic, he informed us that it was a common practice of sleeze bag mechanics to ""program"" the vehicle to ignore certain codes so that the ""check engine light"" would not illuminate and the vehicle could pass inspection.  Armed with a list of codes and explainations, we made not one, or two, but five trips to the dealership and spoke to almost every sales person and all of the management with the exception of the GM he was always unavailable and did not respond to e-mails.   Finally, on the fifth trip we were basically told that the vehicle was sold ""as is"" and we should have purchased a warranty.  We offered to pay for the parts if they would simply install them. We were not so politely told, labor is $170 per hour, I don't know how many hours it will take but your welcome to pay is for the repair because ""there is nothing that I can do for you""!

I have never purchased a vehicle either new or used that the dealership did not stand behind and make right any issues regardless of whether or not I had purchased a warranty in my life.  I would write about the ethics and morals of the management at this dealership, however they have none so there is nothing to write. If you want to buy a vehicle new or used, there are a lot of other dealerships that make right what is wrong for the sake of future vehicle sales.  I seriously doubt that this dealership has any repeat business based on the service reviews that I have read on this and other sites. PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR!!! DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THESE CROOKS!!!

407,"January 20, 2015","I recently purchased a used 2007 Ford Expedition on November 17, 2014. My experience with your dealership has been nothing short of horrific.  From the time we arrived to inquire about the vehicle to tonight when the ASM Mr. Mike Brooks told me to ‚Äúget out of here.‚Äù I have never encountered such an unprofessional sales and managerial team. The first night we were there our sales  consultant Jason Reid and Sales Manager Paul Garrett almost went to fisticuffs. Paul asked Jason if he was calling him a liar and Jason said yes you are a liar. Paul asked ‚Äúyou want to go?‚Äù and the others around them had to hold them back. The whole time customers were watching through the glass walls and wondering what was happening. 
                The next day when I was told my vehicle was ready I  arrived to find it had not been washed or vacuumed. Jason apologized and said he would take care of it and I could come pick it up later that day. Needless to say when I came back it was only half done. Jason called ASM Colt Carson and they both said your detail shop was a joke and they always have issues. There was trash on the floor board, no temporary license plate and stickers on the windshields. One sticker said ‚Äúdo not sell?‚Äù Colt asked me to really complain to the detail guy and light him up. I told them I would come back, I simply want it cleaned and could come back several hours later if needed. The third time I arrived it was still un-cleaned and Colt called the detail manager to make sure I could explain what my expectation were. 
                Two weeks ago I began to have issues with the Air Conditioning and a jerking motion when I accelerated. I took my vehicle to your service department yesterday and was again disappointed with the service. Your service representative was helpful but very confused with the process. She failed to call my cell and let me know the status, later to find out that she had been calling the wrong number. I was told the next day that the jerking motion was caused by ‚Äúold and rusted‚Äù spark plugs. The technician said it needed a tune up. I asked if it was customary for you to sell vehicles without first giving them a tune up (oil, filters and spark plugs). I have yet to receive an answer but have been told ‚Äúwe make sure the vehicle is safe‚Äù and that not all the vehicles get tune ups.
                I called my sales consultant Jason Reid to see what was the standard practice at your dealership. After he basically said I don‚Äôt know what the technicians do I asked to speak with ASM Colt Carlson. Colt said I‚Äôm sorry there is nothing I can do. I decided to drive up to the dealership and speak with a senior manager. When I arrived I was met by David Diamond. I asked to speak with a manager and he said Mr. Mike Brooks could help me. I sat down and told Mr. Brooks my experience from the first time I walked in to that afternoon. He said write your name down and I‚Äôll see what your situation looks like. After about 20 minutes he came back and said they are right, there is nothing I can do for you. I said I was very unhappy with my service. 
                As I walked away I asked him for his business card and he said he was out. I asked him for his name and he simply said Brooks. I asked him if he could write it down for me. He took a post it note and wrote his last name. I said can you give me your full name? He said what do you need it for? I simply told him that I wanted to know who I was talking to. He said it‚Äôs Michael, so I wrote it on the note. I then felt he had not been honest with me and asked one of his coworkers what the gentleman‚Äôs name was. He said Richard? And then Mr. Brooks walked up to me and asked what I was doing. I told him I asked the other employee for his name since he was not being forthright with me. He then yelled out to two other employees and asked them ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs my name?‚Äù He asked if I wanted to cause a scene. I said no and began to turn away. Mr. Brooks then said under his breath ‚Äúget out of here.‚Äù I was taken back and said excuse me, but did you just tell me to get out of here? He said what do you want? Do you want to start something? I told him I could not believe he told a current customer to ‚Äúget out of here.‚Äù I have never in my life been asked to get out of a public establishment. He then walked behind my wife and I as we left.

409,"January 05, 2015","I bought a used vehicle from Mac Churchill and had multiple major issues with the process. Besides not receiving any documentation on the bumper to bumper warranty (even when directly asking), them not honoring a WE OWE for major repairs and failing to cancel my maintenance contract when they repeatedly said they would; The biggest issue is that they inflated the negotiated base sales of the vehicle by $1,500.00 on the sales contract and they lied when directly asking about it. Paul Garrett said there are ""fees rolled into the back-end"". I signed the contract and later found out this is completely false and they flat out jacked the price out on me. When I called their bluff and provided evidence to show they blatantly increased the price, they made up a new contract and said they would submit it to my lender. I went in on several occasions over the next few months and talked with many different finance reps including the assistant finance director Ali. All of them promised the second contract was sent to the lender. After 3 months of demanding why they have not made good on their promise and why my lender still reflected the inflated amount, I finally got to sit down with the Finance director Ray. Ray admitted that they had not sent in the second contract and that there was ""nothing he could do because it was too late"". These guys flat out committed fraud, lied to brush me off and are not offering a resolution. If you want my opinion.... DO NOT BUY FROM HERE!! READ BETTER AND MORE ACCURATE REVIEWS ON YELP!!!!",1.0

415,"December 01, 2014","In order to provide you with the premise to my less than favorable experience, I must begin by saying that I initially ordered a few parts during this past weekend. Ignocio provided me with the expectation that my parts would be at Mac Churchill acura, a little after 10 am that following Tuesday. Tuesday afternoon I called and spoke to KD not knowing that he in fact is this new Parts Director. I for one am normally not so quick to judge someone over the phone, but lets just say this individual could care least about providing and excellent customer experience. I inquired to see if my parts had arrived, and KD responded that it would be probably after Thanksgiving before they would receive my part. At this point I begin to tell KD about my frustrations with the delay, and I also asked why I hadn't been contacted. His response was that they are unaware if a part is available after an order is placed, and that they didn't notice that the part wasnt in stock until Tuesday. I wasnt so receptive of this explanation as I know that an order that is shipped often is accompanied by a tracking number. My issue was that upon realizing that the part wasn't in stock, I should have received a phone call. KD didnt apologize for the inconvenience or even acknowledge that his staff had dropped the ball. Honestly how hard is that. Later I called Ignocio, in order to be proactive and make certain the part at the other warehouse was available. I asked for him to call me back once he had confirmed with the vendor, that the part was in stock. He returned my phone call which i happen to appreciate.I didnt realize that I had to help someone at an Acura dealership to do their job. Considering the events that had recently transpired,  calling the vendor should have been KD's suggestion. Wednesday morning Ignocio called me again to tell me that my parts were ready for pickup. Upon arrival I was actually in good spirits to finally get my much needed parts. KD met me at the parts counter and extended his hand in what I thought at the time was a friendly gesture. The man practically squeezed my hand and said in a rash tone, ""So you're Mr. Turner"". I immediately dismissed this,  for I was only their to pickup my parts. KD went on to say that I sounded like I was upset the day before, and that I wouldn't give him 10 seconds to explain what he could do. Once again I told him that I was merely there to purchase my items and leave.  KD then said, "" Well you said that you have been unsatisfied for awhile, and if I were you I wouldnt be upset if you went somewhere else"". I was very appalled by this statement, and that he felt comfortable to say this in front of other customers and the cashier which I know could hear the conversation on the other side of the wall. I responded in kind and told KD that I appreciated his comment although I felt disrespected.  I have been a loyal customer at Mac Churchill acura for 3 years. I really am dissapointed that the previous Parts Director Johnny, left Mac Churchill, for he would never speak to me in such a matter. After careful consideration I will no longer shop at Mac Churchill acura. Not only was I disrespected but I felt threatened. It was apparent that during the entire conversation that KD was attempting to provoke an arguement. I  refused to give him the satisfaction. I am wondering if this is acceptable behavior at Mac Churchill Acura, and if the General Manager allows this type of inappropriate conduct? I guess Ignocio and KD have rid themselves of a loyal customer. My expectations of an inviting and professional customer experience was lacking today at Mac Churchill Acura. Considering that this is a luxury car dealership I am beyond baffled.",1.6

When I left a message for the service manager to call me so I could give him an opportunity to address my concerns, he didn't call until 7pm the next day and just said, ""Sorry I missed your call."" I advised him I had called the day before. I had already emailed the GM and Service Director of the dealership since I had not heard from the Service Manager and neither of them responded to me.

435,"September 05, 2014","I purchased my car in may from the Mac Churchill Pre-Owned side and had to say initially had a great experience.  My salesman Alex was very kind, I saw the vehicle I wanted on line and when I arrived it poked as though they just got the vehicle in and it had not been through the initial check.  Once I finished the purchase and signed the papers I expressed to Alex I wanted to leave the vehicle so that they could detail it and run all the necessary checks on it, this was at the close of business and stated since I had purchased it I should go ahead and take it and we could schedule a time for me to come back and have that done.  Reluctantly I took the car.  That same weekend I took the vehicle to discount tire to have the tires rotated and when they took the tires of I was very disturbed at what the attendant told me.  He asked me to come look at the tires, the inside of all four tires had large cracks all around the edges, which clearly is a safety hazard and an accident waiting to happen.  The attendant stated I needed all new tires.  I was shocked because looking at the tires on the car they looked brand new!‚Ä¶However three had not been replace since 09' when the prior owner purchased the vehicle and the other since 12'.  I told him to put the tires back on so I could take the vehicle back to the dealership to let them know, when I got there I expressed this to Alex and let him know I have a three year old and I didn't feel safe.  He said he would see what he could do but it would be taken care of.  They kept my vehicle all day while I thought they were coming up with a solution‚Ä¶they called me hours later to tell me my car was ready, when I got there they had cleaned it up, I looked at the tires (and again they looked new from the outside) and said oh you replaced the tires!  He said no they said they were not going to replace them, I asked did they take them off and look at the, because there is no way‚Ä¶he said yes they did, I said well why rant they going to do anything?  He said because they passed inspection, I said I'm not comfortable with that can I speak with a manager.  At that point he went and got MIKE BROOKS, who was arrogant, rude and nonchalant. after talking to a brick wall for 5 minutes and getting no response I told him I didn't want to speak with him anymore due to his unconcerned nonchalant attitude.  I asked who was over him and he walked away and proceeded to get MIKE MATA.  His approach was very kind, he listened to my concerns and stated he could not replace them because the tires were good and passed inspection, I told him I just didn't want to have a blow out with my child in the car or get in an accident due to a blow out, he said I think the tire are fin but ""I'll tell you what, if something goes wrong with these tires within 3 months, I'll take care of it.""‚Ä¶.Well fast forward 3 months later and what do you know‚Ä¶blow out!‚Ä¶The tire was completely worn in the are of the dry rot and cracks.  I looked at the other tires and they were all doing the same thing in the same place but had not gotten that bad yet.  I immediately called and asked for MIKE, but he was off, I spoke to a manager and told him our discussion and he said go ahead and bring it, if thats what Mike told you then I'm sure he will help ""HE'S A MAN OF HIS WORD"".  I called the following day when he was expected to return and got him on the phone.  I explained who I was and asked if he recalled the discussion we had in regards to my tires.  He said "" I sell over 500 cars a month, so no I don't"".  He immediately was on the defense and talking over me saying things like ""What, what, whats the problem you got a flat, you stranded what?  I'm asking you the problem, but your not saying anything!  I said I would if you would stop talking over me!‚Ä¶I said the car is right outside your door with a flat.  He said ""if your gonna have an attitude with me you can just come get your car now and I won't do anything!""  I said I'm matching the tone your taking with me and the lack of customer service you all display, do you really think I want to deal with you anymore than you want to deal with me!  I said, the only reason I came back there was because of what you promised me, believe me I wouldn't have if you hadn't given me your word!  I said my M.O. is not to raise my voice and act stupid and crazy or like an xxxxxxx with you, thats not me but I have let you get me totally out of character.  He then said well what do you want me to to do‚Ä¶I will put some used tires on it that aren't dry rotted since the dry rot is the problem right!  I said yes, I said I will be up there in an hour so that I can see what your putting on my car.  He said ""No tho isn't come pick out the tire you want""  I said so what your just gonna put some tire with no tread on my car he said no but your not picking them out!  I said I'll see you in an hour he proceed to make a few more smart comments before I hung up on him.  I then left work in the middle of the day and as I was exiting for the dealership he calls like he was a totally different person swig he ordered me a set of tire that would be in the following day.  I told him the other manager stated they would give me a loaner and asked was this true or possible he said sure.  I was thinking I don't know what made him flip or change his attitude but quickly realized it was short lived.  He did not even come out of the office to great me although I could see him through the glass and had a salesman who had no idea what was going on give me the most discussing car they had which smelled like smoke, the remote to lock and unlock the door did not work, and the low tire pressure light was on but I was to exhausted to ask for something else I took the car anyway.  They then called me the next day around 1 and let me know it was done, my fianc√© went to get my keys and look at the car since I was at work he told me they had put tires that had cracks from weather wear on them back on my car and not only that they wed not uniform, there were 3 of the same brand and one Michelin, in which all were used and were not run flats like my car is supposed to have due to them being a performance low profile wider rim.  My fianc√© then went inside to speak with MIKE MATA and he refused to come out of the office once the receptionist went back an fourth repeatedly and told Mike found out he was there in regards to me.  He sent other people out to speak to him and when he asked the other manager JAMES who was over MIKE MATA he told him TONY, he asked James what was Tony's last name he replied with I DONT KNOW‚Ä¶my fianc√© knew he was lying but at this point was fed up he asked the receptionist and left.  After I got off we went back to pick my car up and I asked for MIKE once again he refused to come out the office.

441,"July 16, 2014","Overall our visit to Mac Churchill was positive. We love the Vehicle we purchased. We will purchase our next vehicle with Mac Churchill if we are able to work with Mark Smith. He was a pleasure to work with. 

I drove from Oklahoma to purchase the vehicle I found online. My initial contact was with Mr. Vickers via phone, it was less than positive. But we were in a crunch and I did like the vehicle. So I decided to make the drive to assess the vehicle and possibly make the purchase. 

I met with Mr. Smith the day I drove down and purchased the vehicle. He was EXCELLENT. He made the car buying experience pleasurable and well worth the drive. He listened to my concerns and advocated a price I was comfortable with. I ABSOLUTELY would make the trip again simply to work with Mr. Smith. 

The day after I purchased the vehicle I stopped by the dealership to iron out a few last minute details before I headed home to Oklahoma. I met Mr. Vickers briefly and I can safely say I WOULD NEVER HAVE PURCHASED IF I HAD WORKED WITH KEITH VICKERS. He is the epitome of a car sales man. For instance, I specifically asked about the condition of the tires prior to making the drive to Texas. He informed me that the tires met Texas regulations and the vehicle was priced to sell with the current tires. Once I arrived and saw the tires, which were not safe to drive home (weathered, no tread including a nail in one). He showed a total disregard for the fact that my two year old and I would be driving over two hundred miles on tires that were completely unsafe. Mark was able to work with me and get it taken care of. The only disappointing thing about the purchase is that Mr. Vickers received credit for our purchase and not Mr. Smith. Huge thank you to Mark Smith! ",4.6

It took nearly four hours to complete buying my car in which time I was pressured repeatedly and was straight up lied to about the car and this was by their managers, not the salesman (who was fired a few weeks later for something unrelated to me).  Sold me a Civic Hybrid and told me to my face that if I took it to my mechanic to check it out, nothing would come back bad.  I shouldn't have listened.  The car had to go into the shop literally the day after buying it to check out some stuff.  Been in multiple times since in the three months that I've had it.  I called and yelled at people for weeks and ultimately got them to fix a single minor issue, which took them about a week and a half with my car in their shop.

Initially, I was told they would require a $130 fee to even look for the problem.  After asking why this wasn‚Äôt covered by my warranty, the agent confirmed it would be covered and their technician did hear the noise.  Since they didn‚Äôt have the necessary staff working on Sunday to diagnose the problem, I was given a loaner car.  

The next day I returned to pick up my house keys and phone charger.  Conveniently, my car was in the wash and they claimed to have solved the problem. Since I hadn‚Äôt received a call saying they‚Äôve solved the problem, I was a bit concerned but happy to have my car back.
Immediately after leaving the dealership, the high pitched whining sound was easily audible.  At this point, I called another dealership and told them Mac Churchill service had just lied to me about a repair and returned my car in the same condition.  The other dealership understood my concern and we scheduled a service visit.  

The next day, the second dealership was able to diagnose the propeller shaft as the issue and the maintenance was performed the same day.

After explaining my frustration to Mac Churchill, they said they were sorry and asked me to tell them what the problem was.

455,"April 19, 2014","I usually don't come on the internet to write reviews often but after purchasing my vehicle through Mac Churchill Acura, experiencing the amazing customer service, quality work environment and excellent selection I really felt I should share my story with others.

I travel a lot, but I also have a big family.  I wanted something that would get decent gas mileage, good cargo / carry room and was relatively safe.  After some discussion with my salesman Jordan Knight, I started looking at Toyota Tundras, a beautiful truck with all the features I wanted plus a great safety rating. I fell in love with the truck within the first five minutes I drove it, it was a 2013 Toyota Tundra Limited.  It's a great driving vehicle with SHARP looks.  After a test drive and some discussion with my salesman, I decided this is the truck for me and my family, I ended up purchasing the vehicle that day and leaving with it that day!

Now, most of the time I would've had my wife help me out and make sure it was the right decision but within just a couple of hours I KNEW this was the truck for me.  All of the Mac Churchill, staff were warm, friendly, and knowledgeable. When I got home, my wife felt the same way I did, she LOVED this truck. It's absolutely one of the best buying decisions I've made all year!

457,"April 03, 2014","Only go here if you like to spend unecessary money on new cars. They will make you believe you have a deal just to get you into dealership. Then they will come up with a million reasons why you should get the trim level below the one you really want and make you pay the price of the higher trim level so the salesman makes a killing. You'll see what I'm talking about if you decide to deal with them. They love it when you choose the higher trim level because they can always get you to agree to a higher price for it then they use the line ""well maybe you are looking at too much of a car, I can get you the lower trim for that price though"" or something similar or in my case the manager asked me why I needed to have the higher trim level.  Is that something that should concern the salesman when you are the one buying. Also, when they agreed to To give me what I wanted for my trade and the new car I submitted my credit app and they told me all I needed to do was go in and sign. When I got there they still tried to put me into the lower trim level. They tried so hard to get me to give in to the lower trim level and make me pay the price of the higher trim level. Ridiculous!! The good thing is after that I picked up and drove straight too Goodson Acura and got what I wanted and not what the salesman told me that I needed.

467,"February 03, 2014","Let me preface this review with the following:  My wife and I live over 300 miles away from the nearest Acura dealership.  We had been eyeballing an Acura TL with Tech for several years now.  After finding the car we wanted at another dealership, we jumped on it.  To no avail, the salesperson at the other dealership told us it had already been sold ""out from underneath"" him.  As luck should have it, Mac Churchill had one in stock.  Our experience at Mac Churchill Acura started out with a bang.  At first, we received excellent customer service from Cheryl Warren, the Internet Sales Director.  She made it seem that a long distance car deal was something that was frequently (and easily) done.  We were happy with the appraisal for our trade and got the deal done in less than a week...over the phone.  When we arrived at the dealership in Fort Worth, I was surprised to see that the car had been detailed, put in the ""SOLD"" parking lot and was waiting for us.  After about a half an hour of waiting for the Finance Guy, we found out what this dealership was really about.

I was hesitant to give over my credit information, as any responsible consumer should be.  After a few hours of giving Cheryl my stats, my credit monitor went off.  They sent inquiries to 5 different banks.  So I asked the obvious question, ""Why all the inquiries?"" Cheryl said that they were only dealing with one bank, American Honda Motor Credit.  She pawned it off to the finance guy.

Enter Daniel Pulido, Finance Guy.  This guy lied to me about the inquiries, and had the nerve to tell me that that I could get my Acura repairs at a Honda dealership.  Not true.  Don't get me wrong, the Honda dealership will gladly repair my Acura, warranty or otherwise, but I'll have to front the cash for parts and labor upon completion...just like any other dealership or repair shop.  I'll then have to take my ""receipt"" to Acura and let them reimburse me.  Had the finance part of the the equation been more truthful, this experience would have more palatable.  

Obviously, we weren't driving 300+ miles to kick tires, so the dealership didn't have to act like I was.  All in all, we love the car and it will serve our family well.  I just hope don't have a catastrophic breakdown.  I don't care to see the ""dark side"" of another dealership any time soon.

469,"November 25, 2013","I worked with JJ when I purchased my CPO MDX from Mac Churchill about 2 months ago. I had been looking for the perfect deal for over 6 months and I finally found the right deal one week after my new baby girl arrived.   I have been extremely busy since my purchase but I was so impressed with my service that I had to write a review for JJ when I got a chance. My experience with JJ was very positive; he definitely went above and beyond his call of duty to assist me and my family.  I wanted to put the new car in my wife's name as I already had a car in my name.  JJ drove home with me after the sales part was done.  It took us an 1.5 hrs to get to my house since we got stuck in the construction traffic on 820.  I apologized to JJ about wasting so much of his time but JJ felt bad for me and he was apologizing to me instead.   I was very impressed with JJ's knowledge and attention to details as he was showing us the car and during our test drive.  He did a much better job than the salesman that I had with my new Acura purchase at another dealership about a year ago. He was faced with my extremely impatient father in law that was trying to rush him but JJ dealt with him with utmost respect and patience.  I was looking mainly at private party deals as I didn't want to deal with a used car dealership based on the reputation of used car salesmen. After my experience with JJ @ MAC, he has changed my perspective of used car sales professionals. I will highly recommend JJ for any of your sales needs at MAC. He will definitely be my salesman of choice when it comes to my next car purchase.

It is unfortunate that my experience went sour after the sales experience, Please see my review on Daniel Pulido and Ray Jones. My recommendation is this: If you find an enticing deal on the website, have your financing ready from your bank or credit union and steer clear from MAC Financing Dept.

It has been 13 weeks and still nothing. Tried to call delearship and nothing. So we called Master Tech and they said they have not received anything from the dealership nor have they received a call from them nothing and they said it should never take more then 3 weeks to receive a refund. Thankfully they were willing to help and she should receive her refund in no more then 3 weeks. I tried to call Daniel Pulido at the dealership and he was not in and has not called back. 
Would she recommend this dealership NO. Would I recommend this dealership NO. If you are a woman not the dealership for you. If you are an elderly person not the place for you.  
They want your money but after that you are nothing. See ya sucker attitude.

Brad was the salesman that assisted me. He had excellent knowledge of the product and demonstrated the car very well. He was professional & was not pushy about making a sale. When I finnished up the dwal with Cisco in Fianance. He was also very knowledgeable & went over possible lease options & warranties. He again was super nice & not pushy. Every employee at Mac Churchill that made eye contact,
greeted me with a smile & asked if they could assist in anyway. Kudoos to the Staff at Mac Churchill Acura.

480,"October 03, 2013","Great experience! We started by shopping online for a 2014 MDX and getting quotes from area Acura dealerships and Mac Churchill Acura had the best first offer. While I was waiting for other quotes, DeQuan Bendaw emailed with an even lower offer and asked what it would take to earn my business. DeQuan was able to make the sale for thousands under every other dealership. DeQuan set up the shipping out of state and made it a very easy process. My only suggestion is making sure Mac Churchill keeps up with the customer once the sale is finalized. I spent a week or so wondering where we were in the paperwork before shipping and called a few times to find out. I would have liked more phone calls, especially since I never actually touched or drove the exact vehicle but this does not change my overall experience. I loved working with Mac Churchill Acura and DeQuan. I am a very satisfied customer.

UPDATE: I guess I need to update my experience with Mac Churchill Acura. Everything leading up to the sale was fantastic. The sales staff were fairly prompt, the price was great, etc. However, service after the sale has been horrendous. Need to talk to your salesman? Get ready to be transferred to a different voicemail every single time. Want to talk to the manager that helped you in your purchase? She is always unavailable and will never return a phone call. I wouldn't bother leaving a message because that got me nowhere. Want to get your paperwork in order to tax, title, and license your new vehicle? Be ready to pull teeth. I'm down to the final 5 days to tax, title, and license my vehicle and nobody at Mac Churchill Acura can provide the correct paperwork. Once I finally got my paperwork in, I was still without my Bill of Sale so I was still unable to pay my TTL. The most interesting part is Sharbel, the General Manager, provides his email address for customers to email him with problems, etc but is not prompt in responding. I emailed him on Monday and still have no response. This awful service is making me really rethink my recommendation of Mac Churchill Acura.",3.2
481,"September 26, 2013","Mike Weide from Mac Churchill Acura knows how to take care of his customers.  Out of all the other Acura dealers in the West Central and South Texas area, he was the only one that kept in touch with me ensuring that all my questions were answered. This was crucial since there are no Acura dealers in the Abilene Texas area. Thanks to his professionalism and knowledge in the Acura line products, I was able to order and purchase my vehicle of choice, all without ever stepping foot at the dealer until the day the vehicle was delivered.

Mike picked me up at the Dallas Fort Worth Airport in the latest 2014 Acura MDX in order for me to get familiar on the handling, GPS navigation, and functions of this vehicle all the while my new vehicle was being prepped.  He knew since I was from out of town that my time was limited. He ensured that the vehicle would be ready for delivery when I arrived.  This was truly a feat since the vehicle arrived that morning.  He ensured that all the accessories were installed, vehicle cleaned and inspected all on time for delivery.

Acura has truly delivered on all fronts with its new 2014 product line.  For a customer to purchase a vehicle by use of the internet tools that Acura has provided is truly amazing.  I was able to research all aspects of this vehicle by merely using several of Acura iPad/iPhone Apps.  The 2014 MDX Tour, the AcuraLink Virtual Tour and the Acura website are all outstanding ways of promoting the vehicle features, specs and the 3D look where it allows you to operate the vehicle controls as you were sitting behind the wheel are truly amazing.  This is truly an amazing design on all fronts.  The Acura 2014 MDX is a solid vehicle with a company that is delivering on all aspects from marketing, design to delivery.

482,"September 26, 2013","The used car I bought from this dealer had a safety issue(power steering failure) and I was barely able to drive it home. I have called the dealer on the way home, took it straight to my local dealer for service, and gotten the power steering pump replaced ($1200) to make the care driveable. No one at this dealership will help me, not Cheryl Warren, not Tony Hamud, and not Sharbel Lattouf. They will not contact me at all, they are hoping I just go away. I contacted them two weeks ago and NO RESPONSE! So if you are considering going to Mac Churchill Acura in Fort Worth for a used car I would recommend against it, go somewhere where customer service is a priority and they do not stick their head in the sand and ignore their customers.

483,"September 18, 2013","Initially I was excited to go to this dealership.  I had to call up to get directions, and as a result took an hour and a half to get there.  The directions sent me about 18 miles off from the correct location.  But my real complaints are an entirely different matter.  

Upon my arrival I was delegated to a fast talking salesman who sat me down.  For an hour.  Then I was given some terrible vehicles to test drive.  One of them was barely running and was painted in such a manner that I'm sure it would not resell.  

Eventually I found a car I liked, a quaint little civic.  I expressed concerns over a large dent on the fender but was told it would be fixed.  Despite saying that I wanted to leave a dozen times I was harassed, berated, and belittled.  They literally took my driver's license and did not return it.  They took my debit card and charged me 200 dollars for a 'deposit' that I did not sign for nor give them my PIN for.  

Finally I left and found, through their website, that the 'listed price' for the car was five thousand over not only its suggested retail price, but the price that they listed on their own website.  

I returned the next day and was again told to wait, run through a variety of vehicles I didn't want.  When I showed them a print off from their own website (That they conveniently could not find) they spent over an hour 'verifying' it.  I was given to another salesman who barely spoke English.  

With the promises of maintenance, a fix to the damaged fender, and other maintenance and cleaning, I signed off on the car.

I was given a loaner car that behaved very well, and after only two more hours of waiting I was on my way.  They told me that by Tuesday it would be out of the body shop and ready for me to pick up.  

I returned tuesday, was sat down for two hours while my salesman ignored me, only to be told that it wasn't finished and that I would be contacted when it was.

The next day I received a call and was at the dealership with in five minutes.  I saw my car as I was parking the loaner.  I handed over the loaner keys and proceeded to wait for another three hours.  I had to harass a manager to get any service, and before I'd even left the lot the car was unsatisfactory.  The wheels were improperly inflated to the point of being dangerous, the fender was only fixed cosmetically, and it rattled like an unholy abomination when I turned or went over any bumps.  They told me that I could leave it there for them to fix, but that I couldn't have another loaner car.  Essentially they would want me to walk home, knowing that I live 40 miles from their dealership.  

They also offered to let me come in and drop it off the next day.  Again, it would take several days to fix and again I would simply be out a car while they did nothing to try and fix it.

Deciding to take matters into my own hands I went to an autozone.  With their assistance I discovered that -THE BUMPER HAD BEEN INCORRECTLY ASSEMBLED AND WAS HELD ON BY GRAVITY ALONE-.  Had I been in any collision it would have flown off.  If I had stopped too hard it would have flown off.  I had  to reassemble the fender well and liner and fasten the bumper on with supplies purchased after I was ensured it would be fixed.

In summary they are overly aggressive salesmen who care for nothing but their bottom line.  They lie and treat you terribly.  It's easy to see why they tout '#1 Volume Acura Dealership in Texas' because they held onto my driver's license and would not give it back with out me yelling for it.

They sell crappy cars for way too much money, and I'm 90% sure my car has been in an unlisted collision.

485,"September 11, 2013","I seldom drop-in to a dealership to shop cars and I usually try to work through the Internet and do my own research long before I schedule a test drive. I already researched the new 2014 Acura MDX but instead of going through the motions of sending an inquiry I just stopped by with my son on our way home for a test drive to see if the MDX would fit our wants and needs.

I was greeted by Courtney and I told her that I was strictly looking to test drive the new Acura MDX in any trim but if I chose to purchase one it would be the upper trim. She pulled a car up after a short wait and gave me the basic rundown of all the features of the vehicle pointing out the differences between the base model I was about to test drive and the upper trim which was going to be my choice of vehicle. She was extremely knowledgeable and I felt she knew more about the vehicle than I did which is a rare occurrence nowadays.

She was very nice with an absolutely no pressure sales demonstration where we ended up test driving the car, I put two kids in the rear, I even moved some luggage and bags from my car into the MDX to get a feel for its cargo capabilities. Overall she was very accommodating and understood my needs and concerns and advised me about the short supply and limited color selection in the upper trim levels of the vehicle.

At the end of our test drive I felt really sold on buying a car from her if I chose to go with Acura and I asked for her business card before she could even offer it to me. She followed up with me via e-mail in a couple of days and provided additional information about availability and ordering status on a new MDX.

Ultimately I ended up getting a different brand of vehicle but true to my word, had I chosen Acura I would have bought it from her based on her professionalism and knowledge. I would not hesitate to recommend her as a sales person to work with at Mac Churchill Acura.",5.0

Incident 1: The first time around on Friday evening, a sales person sold us a 2011 Honda Pilot with hail damage in the dark so I could not see it I was somewhat glad I was able to return it. I came to get my trade-in back and go somewhere else. But, I chose to get another vehicle there which was very stupid of me. I just figured the 2nd try has to be better, WRONG! 

Incident 2: I instead chose another vehicle which was a mistake. Mac Churchill failed to overlook a big problem that almost caused my family to get in a car accident. We were driving in the rain the day after we bought the vehicle, I went to turn on the windshield wipers and there was no windshield wiper on the DRIVERS side!! I could not see a thing and could not drive safely. I had my wife and kids with me and was very upset.  I had to pull over and wait 2 hours for the rain to pass because I had no windshield wiper and it was dark. 

This place is a joke and does not care about what the customer wants. Move on people!

Mike tried to sell me a car by trashing the competition instead of promoting his product, which I found to be very childish and immature. 2 minutes after leaving the store he called me and said he accepted my offer. At that moment he took my credit card number over the phone to place a $500 hold to secure the offer. I drove by a different dealership in Arlington and was offered a better deal and Mike West wanted proof of the offer before he would consider beating Vandergriff's deal. I am not in high school and I don't feel like I need to go through this hassle or drama to purchase a $40,000 vehicle. Mike said he could not beat the deal and refused to issue a refund to my credit card (which is illegal in the state of Texas) and will only do it if I come back to his store with my credit card (even though the number was given over the phone). Save yourself frustration and money and shop elsewhere. Car buying should be fun and unfortunately this manager made this the worst experience I've ever had.

Over the years we have probably bought and sold at least a dozen cars, the majority being new. At the critical point, rather than walking away and letting us discuss the terms they were offering, the salesperson's closing approach was to get aggressive and to insult us claiming we were 'wasting his time'!  His job is to sell us the car, so I don't understand how WE were wasting his time. We want to buy a car. The New Car Sales director did come out and apologize to us, but the damage was already done. We walked. In a way, the experience did us a favor, because we bought the next day at a fantastic dealership in Plano instead.

552,"May 15, 2013","took advantage of a groupon this service dept had for an alignment.  after wasting 1-1/2 hours of her time, they flat out lied to my wife, who took the vehicle in, saying that parts were broken and they couldn't loosen the bolts/nuts needed to perform the alignment.  they told her to just get a refund from groupon.

when I called to ask about this, I was told that different parts were broken and the parts they told my wife were broken were not just worn out.  and now they are saying they were able to adjust one of the front wheels and one of the back.  this was when I informed them most of the front end had just been replaced and the parts in reference were said to be good (or they'd have been replaced as well).  when I looked at the print out they provided of before and after, only one wheel was different... and that actually was done so as to REALLY put the car out of alignment.  remember, we'd just had the front end worked over and just wanted an alignment for good measure.

I'd dropped it until they called me for a follow-up, where the lady said she'd tell the service manager so I advised since she was concerned about the lack of service we got that I'd deal with the service manager when I got back in town.  when the time came, I called to speak to him and was left on hold for over 8 minutes before they came back to tell me he was on the phone.  so I just stopped by.  huge waste of time.  kept on saying parts were broken... any one with a rudimentary knowledge of a front end knows that if tie rods are 'broken' that the car won't steer and should be advised as unsafe to drive.

talked to the front end mechanic again and he advised all the parts in question are good.  then took the car to a front end specialty shop and paid them to inspect the front end to be told that there is nothing wrong with the parts that Mac Churchill Acura service dept repeatedly claimed as bad.

it is my opinion that it was all a major waste of time, bad service, sub-standard work, and some type of shuck-and-jive to either not honor the groupon or to get us to pay for service not needed or to cover up their lack of ability/quality/service.",1.0

554,"May 13, 2013","I bought a 2008 BMW X5 around 26 February 2013. Dre in sales was one of the best, if not THE best salesmen I've ever had the chance of working with. There were a few small problems but he worked everything out and got me on the road. With that being said I moved onto the finance department to finish my transaction. I was told that my trade-in was going to be paid off and that everything else was good to go. 

A few months later I get a call from my old finance company and was told there was still a balance on my trade-in. When I asked why they said that they gave Mac Churchill the payoff amount and that that amount was good for 10 days and that they didn't send the payment in until almost a month later. So the payoff amount that they had was no longer valid and there was a remaining balance on the car. 

I contacted Mac Churchill Finance department and explained the problem and was told that they would look into it and would call me right back.  A week goes by and I called back up, explained what happened again and was again told that they would look into it and call me right back. Another week goes by with no call so I head back to Mac Churchill and ask to speak with the Finance Manager. I waited 40 minutes before I was finally seen. When I was finally able to talk to someone I was told that, ""We paid off the amount that was give to us."" I told them that they didn't pay it off in the time the bank gave them and that it was a mistake on their part not mine. I was then told that they already had the title to the vehicle and that the remaining balance fell on me to pay. And if it wasn't paid it would reflect on my credit and not affect the dealership. 

The next day I called the company that financed the car and explained what the dealership had said. They told me that as long as there was a balance THEY, not the dealership, had the title and that they would not release it until the balance was paid in full. They also said that it looked like the dealership was trying to make me pay for their mistake. 

It upsets me that I signed an agreement with the dealership stating that the vehicle was going to be paid in full and because of their mistake I was stuck with the balance. ",1.3

He casually asked me if I was ready to get a new car and he thought the new ILX would be a good fit for me. He had the color I wanted and said I would not be out any money out of pocket. The next day I went back with my BBF to negotiate a deal even though I loved my TSX. I ended up leasing a new 2013 TL before the day was over! This was the car my BF wanted me to get when I got the TSX the year before.

There was no high pressure from Phil or Mike at all. It was the first time I went to get a car and was very comfortable with the salesmen. Phil is honest and very outgoing, a real people person! Mac Churchill Acura is my dealership now. They certainly made up for my first experience there and they will get my repeat business.

This is something I would expect from a tote the note lot. Not MacChurchill. When I brought this to the managers attention, his response was that's what you get with a 10 year old vehicle. Really? What I expect is MacChurchill is going to sell me a sound vehicle at a reasonable price. If something is broke, drop the price or fix it. Needless to say, we bought this vehicle fully loaded, it's not. Rear A/C and heat is a big deal in these vehicles and I'm sure it's not cheap to fix.

603,"February 23, 2013","I bought my 2013 Acura ILX at Mac Churchill and everything was fine.  However, I have had it in for service several times and have had the following issues:

1) When they fixed the door recall, someone forgot to plug the passenger power lock harness back in, so my door wasnt locking for a week until I noticed it.  Had to take it back again to get that fixed, which is always a pain.  Also, the car was practically brand new it and there was a chip on the front bumper from either them installing the license plates or the car wash (I told them not to run it through the car wash). They gave me some free touch up paint and touched it up for me, but still it's annoying on a new car.  

2) I just took it in for an oil change today and when I got home I noticed the rear bumper had damage.  It appears to have been from another car's license plate holder bumping it.  The damage was more substantial than what I saw on the front bumper before. 

 My car has under 10000 miles on it, but has several cosmetic damages now - all of which came from me taking my car in for SERVICE.  Ridiculous.  If you take your car here, make sure you do a walk around before and after with them ... which they may scoff at or is sometimes difficult when they are busy.  Very frustrating for a new car owner.  I wouldn't care if it was an older car, but this is under a year old and I take great care of it.

I did not experience any hassles before and during the purchase of my new car.  For the first time my car buying experience was absolutely terrific!!!  I recommend anyone looking to buy an Acura to go to MacChurchill Acura.  They are truly the best Acura dealership.  They are very customer focus and believe in finding and exhausting every avenue to get you financed.  MacChurchill is very fair, honest, and believe in that retention of customers. 

I flew from Houston Texas to purchase my car from MacChurhill in the greater Ft Worth/Dallas area, and I am 100% satisfied with the choice I made!!

Being that I am so busy in the music industry, I wanted a car that would provide me all the means and comfort for my day to day driving. That is why I purchased the 2013 Acura TL on the date of January 2013.

Thanks so much!!!  Everyone you should buy your next ACURA FROM MACCHURCHILL!!  ASK FOR MIKE WEST.

I went to my bank to get my loan in order and came back to discuss my terms with the dealership on the price and the car report. After a battle with absolutely rude manager named Paul Garnett, the sales person Dung spoke more reasonable and we agreed for the dealership to take the vehicle to a mechanic shop to get a full diagnostics report done before I made my purchase. They wrote a contract stating that I paid $500 down to reserve the car and for them to take it to the shop as agreed. The morning that they were suppose to take it to the shop I instead received a phone call that my car that I paid $500 down for had been sold. Kind of funny since they weren't able to sell it for the past 7 months, and my paperwork had seemed to just disappear when someone else is interested in it, especially when they said it wouldn't be for sale.

623,"December 24, 2012","Well, I've been looking for a used car for a few weeks now since my truck is on its' last legs.  I viewed a Pontiac GTO on the website but the transmission was un-specified. So I, with nothing to do, decided to drive down there to specify for myself.  Worst decision of my life.  I was looking in the windows of the car and noticed it was a manual (which is what I want), only to turn around to see a salesman standing behind me.  Then he just stared at me and didn't say a word, I had to start the conversation.  I asked him if I could take a look at the interior and he said that we could after some paperwork, which confused me.  His explanation was that the dealership wants to know who is interested in their vehicles. I told him that I wasn't going to be able to purchase the car that night, because me, being a college student who pays cash for everything has no credit and therefore I need a co-signer.  So I filled out his silly paperwork, which takes a long time by the way, and waited.  He came back only to tell me that since I don't have any credit, I can't test drive the vehicle.  I told him that was fine and asked if we could still look at the inside of the car.  He the proceeded to tell me that  he couldn't show me the car at all and that I would have to come back with someone who has credit to be able to look at it. I made sure to get all of the paperwork back that I filled out because there was personal information on it. Of course, the entire time he was trying to push me to get someone down there to sign papers.  He even HAD THE AUDACITY to try to get me to give him my mothers information (Drivers license #, SSN, Income, etc.) so we could start the process without her being there, which made me extremely uncomfortable. I will not be back as I don't want to waste my time with a bunch of xxxxx.  Go to a dealership where your business will actually be appreciated. ",1.8

Acura in Fort Worth and Mike Luong exceeded my highest expectations. What brought me to the dealership was a post card that I had received from Alliance Direct Lending to refinance my 2008 Ford Fusion at a much lower rate. Prior to going to Acura, I had every intention of keeping my Ford vehicle that I had purchased at a Ford dealership (at the time thinking that I would be a lifetime Customer of Ford) and refinancing the loan. I was very pleasantly surprised that Acura and Mike, through their ability to provide EXCELLENT customer service surpassed even my highest expectations. Beginning from the time that I drove onto the lot until the time I left with my vehicle that I purchased from Acura. For that, I am proud to say that yes, this dealership converted even the most stubborn individual. I consider myself, an Acura of Fort Worth lifetime customer. KOODOS Mike and Acura!!!

628,"December 07, 2012","I was at this dealer for about 4 hours when I bought my used 08' chevy malibu. My sales guy Thai showed me cars that was not accessible to me which wasted time, gave me the run-around, did not return my phone calls after I told him that something was wrong with my car (after I bought the Chevy), disregarded me, and tried to sell me a car that had something wrong with the engine. Britney Luna took 5 days to get back to me after my husband and I left her several messages about the noises I heard coming from my brakes. When I finally spoke with her it was because ""I"" called her. Matt in the service department told me to bring my car in to be fixed because 1 day after I took my Chevy Malibu home I heard a noise in my tire AND my brakes were grinding. The noise was subtle but never the less noticeable. Thai and the other service guys kept telling me they did not hear anything and frankly ""threw me away."" I went to the dealerships service department 3 times. Finally, the last time I went after speaking to Matt (the man in charge) I waited 3 hours only for Daniel to come out and tell me that I would have to pay for any charges accrued if they fix my car (the brakes). I tried explaining to him that Matt sent me and that i'd just purchased the vehicle 2 weeks prior and that I shouldn't have to pay for anything.

630,"December 01, 2012","I would like to thank Mike Weide for an outstanding buying experience! The car buying experience can be uncomfortable and nerve-racking, but Mike earned my trust and set me at ease from our first email communication. Due to my travel schedule, I unfortunately had to throw a couple of curve xxxxx affecting the end of the month time schedule. Mike was kind enough to ensure the discounts, rebates, and dollars for my trade remained intact. When we were finally able to visit the dealership (just before closing time), Mike was ready for our visit and gave us a complete demo on his own time. After the demo, we had to have this MDX!

After looking at some of the eye candy on the showroom floor, we decided that we wanted to pursue adding accessories to the already pre-negotiated price for the vehicle. Mike was very accommodating and did his best to make that happen. Knowing we were at the top of our budget, he went the extra mile to obtain additional pricing that was manageable and made for a happier ownership experience for my wife. We did have a miscommunication regarding an accessory, and Mike went way above and beyond to rectify the issue to ensure we were totally satisfied. No beef, no complaints, no debating, just dedication on Mike's part. 

I have owned many new cars and this is our 4th Acura and second Acura purchased in 2012. We could not be happier with this experience and want to make sure Acura and other shoppers understand our appreciation for Mike's honesty, integrity, and overall commitment to ensuring this was a happy satisfying Acura purchase.

We will definitely be back to Acura, Mac Churchill, and Mike for our next vehicle! In addition, since we live 35 miles away and closer to other Acura dealers, we will go out of our way to ensure both of our vehicles are serviced and maintained by Mac Churchill.

Thank you Mike!!!!!!!!

631,"November 30, 2012","I had the absolute worst experience at this dealership not once, but twice ‚Äì so I know it was not just a one-off situation.    I went to the lot twice to just look at and drive a pre-owned car.  Both times, I clearly told them I was only looking and that I could not and would not purchase that night.  Both times, they wasted 3 hours of my time and tried to put the hard-sell on me, even though I continually told them I would not purchase that day. They pressured me and made me feel uncomfortable, and forced me to sit through unnecessary paperwork multiple times.  Who should have to fill out paperwork just to look??  They even belittled me about my trade-in and disrespected me and my time by continuing to hold me hostage by not returning my vehicle after appraising it.  Instead of giving my keys back, they brought around an additional car to try and force on me.  I eventually had to demand my keys back and advised them that their behavior was not winning my business ‚Äì just the opposite.   I will say that Dayne was very nice and he seemed to want to help me and not drag me through the corporate mud at this dealership, but niceness only goes so far when the overall mentality at the dealership is to pressure you to the point of insanity.   I left this dealership feeling very upset and frustrated, and I would never recommend it to anyone.   I sent an email to the salesman and the general manager, Sharbel Lattouf, and have yet to receive an apology or even an acknowledgement.  I see here on this website that Mr. Lattouf has graciously acknowledged every positive rating on this website, but he has not addressed any of the negative ones.  Shame on you!!

The other problem is that my car had several things wrong with it.  I felt going to a top notch dealership that the car would be inspected and in good running condition.  They do not inspect their used cars.  I have taken my car back to service 5 times in 4 mos.  Somethings were under warranty somethings I had to pay out of pocket.  I did buy the extended warranty and the maint. warranty.  I still had to pay for things.  Next time I can just go to a no name dealership and have better service. I chose McChurchill beccause I wanted an Acura and they were so called one of the best.  So I guess they just take used cars park them and sell them without checking the cars. I would not recommend McChurchill Acura to anyone.  The best dealership I have come across is Don Davis, unfortunately they do not sell any acuras.

I told them in emails and on the phone that I was interested but they kept pushing for me to come now before my car lost its value.  I was coming in Monday, not in a year.

634,"November 11, 2012","I've been saving for few years to buy a different car and was set on purchasing a low mile used (service loaner/lease return) instead of brand new.  After much looking/research, I decided on 2012 Acura TL due to the refined body style and slightly improved gas mileage over the prior year TL model.  I searched Autotrader.com for weeks and found exactly what I was looking for (certified used 2012 TL/Tech, white/parchment leather) 3 hours away at Mac Churchill Acura.  I decided to use the website's instant message feature to inquire more about the car with a random salesman.  Lucky for me, Michael Weide was the salesman that responded.  Mike was very helpful in explaining the features of the car over several messages but  being somewhat skeptical of car salesmen, I  decided not to provide my phone number.  I haven't purchased a car in years and do NOT enjoy the process.  I  wasn't real serious about buying a car 3 hours away from a dealer i knew little about anyway.  My local dealer only had brand new TLs in stock and most of which had severe hail damage from recent storm. After much thought and continuous searching, I decided to call Mike and see if the car was still available a couple of days later. Bottom line, due to my reservations I missed out on the car.  Like any good salesman Mike told me the deals Mac Churchill  had on brand new TLs but I explained i wanted low mile used since i wasn't financing.  He took down my requirements and seemed genuinely interested in helping me find exactly what I wanted.  In a few days he called me back and said ""I've found your car"".  As it turns out he did.  He found a service loaner that was soon to come up for sale.  As promised, he called me a few days later and gave me first opportunity to buy it.  He presented a fair price and we made the deal over the phone.  Long story short, the car was as described when I arrived to pick it up a few days later.  It was a busy Saturday at Mac Churchill when I arrived, but Mike didn't just rush me through the paperwork and get me out the door so he wouldn't miss out on another sales opportunity.  He truly wanted me to be comfortable with the deal and took lots of time showing me the features of the car and programming settings based on my preferences.  Mike is a true customer service professional and he made my Mac Churchill buying experience enjoyable.  Four months later I'm enjoying my 2012 TL Tech and I know if I ever have a question I can always email Mike.   Although it's 3 hours from my home, I won't hesitate to call Mike at Mac Churchill if I'm ever in the market for another Acura. ",4.8

639,"November 09, 2012","The folks at Mac Churchill Acura were very professional and made it very easy to do business with them.  After visiting the local dealership here in El Paso it was obvious I would need to look for an Acura outside of El Paso.  When I contacted Mac Churchill Acura, Michael Weide was very helpful and knowledgeable and immediately went to work to make the entire purchase experience very enjoyable! 

Pre-Purchase ‚Äì Michael took the time to go over everything I needed to provide to get qualified for the financing.  Provided pictures of the car since I was buying virtually and kept me informed periodically with any and all updates.

Purchase Day 10/13/12 ‚Äì Michael picked me up at the airport drove me to the dealership and introduced me to the folks I would be working with to sign the documents.   He also took the time to go over all the features of the car and patiently answered all my questions.

Post-Purchase ‚Äì Almost a month after buy the car I have received correspondence and follow up phone calls or emails from Michael and other folks from Mac Churchill Acura. 
 
I really feel that I was not treated as another sales transaction.  I will definitely recommend Mac Churchill Acura to anyone interested in buying an Acura.

643,"November 01, 2012","We bought our Nissan Altima from Mac Churchhill Acura this past July. My wife chose the car after she sent me some photos of it. It was a 2010 used model, that had been used by Interprise. After driving it for 3 months I noticed the back tires were worse than when we bought it. On 10-31-12 the car started making funny noises, I checked everything and to my surprise I found the steel showing on the back passenger tire and the opposite side wasnt much better. Took it to Discout tires to get 2 new tires on back, when they lifted the car to put them on we found out why the tires are wearing out. THE AXEL IS BENT. Called MAC CHURCHHILL ACURA to let them know. I was hung up on twice, given the run around for 2 hours. Finally some Mike guy that said he was a used car manager talked to me. (I might mention that the special wrench to take off the locked lugnuts was not anywhere in the car). Told him everything, he then told me that Enterprise had a inspection review as well as MAC CHURCHHILL ACURA, showing car was in good condition. THAT IS A LIE..... Get that in a minute. Was told tires had been rotated, I then asked if tires were rotated then why wasnt the lugnut socket not in the car? He started stuttering then. He told me to come in today 11-1-2012, and they would replace the lugnuts. I then asked are they going to check out the problems with the tires and such, was told yes. Took it out there today and was given the cold shoulder by many employees. Finally after 2 hours some goof ball that said he was the person that made decisions there told me they had replaced the lugnuts. I then asked him what about the tires and Axel. He said oh yeah, you have a bent axel. I asked what are they going to do about it, he stated nothing. And I said why not. He said because, its a broke axel, it had to have hit something hard, I then said yeah it must have before I bought the car, because we have not hit, ran over or been hit in this car. He told me it was out of his hands, That pissed me off. I asked to speak to someone higher up than him, I was told he was the highest. Yeah maybe on some kind of drug !!! About the inspection reviews from Enterpris and MAC CHURCHHILL ACURA, I have not been showed them, and even if I did it would be so easy for some mechanic to just mark everything ok.

652,"October 10, 2012",I have leased three new TSX's from McChurchill Acura since 2010.

653,"October 08, 2012","It is unfortunate that customer service isn't what it used to be. Even as much, it is quite discouraging that such a prestigious dealership would employ individuals lacking customer conscious service. Originally I placed an order for some parts online, and contacted the dealership afterwhich to follow up on the delivery time. Upon speaking to a Parts Specialist, by the name of Ignocio, I could tell from the tone of his voice I wasn't going to get the level of customer care that I have come to expect from an Acura dealership. At the time I requested that my parts not be shipped to my home address as I would pick them up directly from the dealership. Egnocio thereby canceled the delivery, and upon request for a confirmation number he exhaled deeply. He then went on to tell me that a confirmation number was unnecesary, and that all I needed to mention was his name. Well to make a long story short I picked up my items the following business day, only to arrive home and notice that one of the parts had been mislabeled. Immediately I called to speak with some in the parts department at Mac Churchill Acura, and ironically Ignocio, was the one to receive my phone call. After explaining to him that my part was incorrect and that as a suggestion the dealership could order both parts to ensure that I receive the correct part; Egnocio stated that he wasn't going to order me alot of parts, because they are unable to send them back. The tone that of his voice was very condescending. He then walked me through the process of checking the part number labeled on the package, along with the part number listed on the invoice. I then informed him that the information matched. He responded by saying, &quot;SO, its the wrong part&quot;? The way I perceived his response was as if he was trying to imply that I was mistaken. Not once did he offer an apology, or make a reference to the fact that ,as uncommon it might be, parts are sometimes mislabeled. At that time I requested to speak with someone else as I could tell that he wasn't going to help me. As a result I then spoke to the manager who re-ordered my bracket and had it expedited. I really appreciate the factor that at least on the managment level customer service is stellar; however I would have to say that the surbodinates are lacking in this department. Even when I drove to the Mac Churchill Acura the following day, I literally stood at the counter for 5 minutes with a clerk standing just befor me.  Then the gentleman says, &quot; What can I do for you&quot;? Honestly my experience at that location was overall the worst at any &quot;Acura&quot; dealership.",2.8
654,"October 04, 2012","I would highly recommend Mac Churchill Acura. I am an internet shopper and was amazed on how competitive they were with their pricing. My salesman, JJ or Jonathan Johnson, quickly responded to my email when inquiring about a vehicle. He was friendly, informative and was able to get a pretty good price on my trade via phone/email. I traveled 8 hours to make the trade and found that it was a long day (about 5 hours) in their office to finalize it. It is for that reason I am giving them a 4 out of 5 for overall experiencence. I will say that they did stick with the number they quoted me on the phone. I think the manager was wanting to lower my old car price, but JJ stepped up to the plate for me since I traveled so far to get this deal done and not to play games with me. I must say that I appreciated him doing so. I love my new car and am happy customer and will be back when my husband needs a new car.",4.8

668,"August 29, 2012","Took my car in to have the antenna repaired. It had been damaged during hail damage repair at another bodyshop (not associated with MacChurchill Acura). The repair was covered by an insurance claim.

There was so much confusion and miscommunication between the service department and my insurance company that it took 2 weeks to get my car diagnosed, inspected by the insurance claims adjuster, repaired and returned to me.  The insurance adjuster called the service department to schedule a time to take a look at my car and was told that my car was not there.  The insurance company called me to make sure where my car was and then called the service department again. Once again, the service department assured the insurance company that my car was not there. My insurance company then cancelled the claim.

I never received any calls from Mac Churchill with updates about my car. I called daily to check on my car, left numerous messages for Mr. Jones, but never received a return call. The only time I was able to speak with him was once or twice when I called and he actually answered the phone.

In order to get this particular repair done on my car, I had to take it to an Acura dealership.  I hope I don't have to take it back to an Acura dealership for repairs again, because frankly, I don't know where I'd take it.

None of these things were provided, and the only excuse Mr. Spooner could provide is that we had negotiated the price too low. When I had to return for the 3rd time to receive the tires that I had already purchased, Instead of filling up my tank as promised to compensate for my 120 mile round-trip drive, Mr. Spooner added 5 gallons of gas.

They assured me any problems were covered by the manufacturer's warranty.  I brought the vehicle to the Mitsubishi dealership and the DTC code was for the timing chain. So a major engine component was bad.  The Mitsubishi dealership  pointed out that one of the wheel studs was broken off.  They showed me the maintenance sheet from Mac Churchill which indicated that they replaced 3 tires and did a rotate and balance.  That means Mac Churchill knew the wheel stud was broken and did nothing to replace it.  Later, I determined that the turning problem was with the transfer case.  The fluid was horrible with large amounts of metal indicating, most likely, that the fluid had never been changed.  Additionally, Mac Churchill performed some sort of body repair, also undisclosed at sale, which I noticed when I replaced the taillights with aftermarket versions.  The rear bumper valence was not properly installed after their repair.

704,"June 15, 2012","Do NOT give these guys your business!  I am still in shock at how awful my experience with Mac Churchill Acura in Fort Worth was.  My manual Acura TSX with navigation was totaled in a car wreck, and I had to find another within a very short timeframe, as insurance only gave me a week with a rental car.  Because finding a used manual TSX with navigation is so difficult, I ended up only locating ONE in the state of Texas in my price range - unluckily for me at Mac Churchill!  

When I first found the car, I immediately noticed some slight damage to the interior and exterior of the car.  It was being sold as a Certified Pre-Owned vehicle, so when I was negotiating to purchase, I asked that these items be fixed.  The dealership refused, and because they were the only ones with what I wanted, I ended up agreeing to purchase with the flaws.  The next day, I took the car to David McDavid in Plano to ask for a quote on fixing the items and was informed that they were still covered under the warranty and could be fixed for free!  Now WHY would Mac Churchill refuse to fix something that is covered under a warranty!  That was my first hint at the quality of service and work they provide.  

I next learned that there were three product updates on my car which had not been performed.  I made some inquiries, and learned all of these items ought to have been fixed under the 150-point inspection to qualify as a Certified Pre-Owned vehicle.  I also noticed that one of my windshield wiper blades was dysfunctional and I had a fog light out - all of which also were on the 150-point inspection.  I contacted Acura Care and was informed that I should have received a checklist of the 150-point inspection at the time of purchase - something I was never given!  I called Mac Churchill and asked them to provide it... the checklist had been filled out for an automatic transmission vehicle which did not have navigation.  Not even my car!

When I contacted Mac Churchill, their employees did not return my call timely, and were very rude to me.  I asked them to provide me with a written note saying how they intended to fix the situation, and was told that they would not do that.  I could bring the car back to the dealership (an hour drive one way) and have them look at it, but they would not send me an email saying they would fix anything.  Mike Hamud, their Used Car Manager, accused me of ""playing games"", got angry with me, and complained that it seemed like I ""didn't trust them""... Of course I don't trust them, I had a list of things they should've done for the Certification that clearly weren't done!

In the end, I finally found someone who would be sensible with me.  I still have to bring the car all the way back to Fort Worth to have things fixed which should've been dealt with immediately.  If I could've given back the car, I would have!  Mac Churchill certainly doesn't deserve my business, and after they correct their mistakes, they won't be getting it again.  They turned buying my car into a time-consuming NIGHTMARE.",1.8

The only issue I had was that I couldn't hear my phone through the Blue Tooth connection.  It connected OK and I could receive the ring tone as well as call out.  The problem was that when I received or made a call, the other party could hear me great, but I couldn't hear them.  The answer was ""turn up the radio volume"".  Well dumb me, I didn't know that, but it took the service reps,(at least two, including the service manager)and the techniciam several hours--requiring a loan car to meet an appointment--to come to that conclusion.  Their response was that it was a problem with my phone.  When I showed them that my phone worked fine in the other TL advanced they loaned me, they looked deeper.   

The car was new to me and I didn't know that the radio volume controlled the phone volume also--but, I would expect that the service staff should know that!!

718,"May 29, 2012","Mac Churchill provided me with the worst car-buying experience I've had to date.  They delivered a Certified 2011 Acura MDX to me with a broken A/C.  They fixed it under warranty, which was fine, but they took 3 days to do it (simple suction hose).  I live out of state and as soon as I got on the highway to drive it home to my wife, I noticed a vibration coming from the front tires.  I immediately took it to another local Acura dealer and they asked me for my ""inspection checklist"", which I never received - didn't know there was one.  When I asked why, the Service Manager told me my tires did not meet the tread depth necessary for Acura Certification and in fact, the tires were dangerously worn down.  The MDX had approximately 10,000 miles.  Mac Churchill would not step up and reimburse me for the $587 I spent on new front tires, so I had to go directly to Acura Client Service.  Thank God for Acura Client Service, because they got me a copy of my certification checklist and Acura's going to reimburse me directly, not Mac Churchill.

I opened car door and noticed immediately vehicle HAD NOT BEEN detailed and questioned whether Auto Butler Warranty Service had been performed.  On May 7, 2012, I returned vehicle to have services previously paid for on April 26, 2012, but not performed to be performed.  On the afternoon of May 7, 2012, I received telephone call from Service Advisor stating that vehicle was ready and ""was beautiful inside and out"".  On May 8, 2012, I returned to pick up my vehicle and ONCE AGAIN my vehicle had not been detailed.  The Service Advisor had lied the evening before when stating that the vehicle ""was beautiful inside and out.""  More disturbing was the fraud that was attempted.  Rather than stating the truth that for the SECOND TIME my vehicle had'nt been serviced the Advisor stated that a more complete detail would be performed next time when the Technician had more time.  I was supposed to be ignorant to the fact that a $99.00 detail service which was paid in full hadn't been performed on my vehicle.  Stains that were in both front and back cup holders were still in the same condition as I had left the vehicle originally on April 26, 2012.  Arrangements were made to have the twice unperformed detail service performed at no cost. Before I could exit the dealership, my car was driven off with the trunk lid up as I was trying to retrieve an umbrella from the trunk, my purse which had been placed on the edge of the trunk was slammed to the hard concrete and a full cup of hot tea was spilled on the floor of the trunk.  I am so thankful that the technician drove forward and not in reverse as I would have been run over as I was standing directly in the back of my vehicle.  I was left shaken.  A broken makeup compact and missing umbrella later I have no confidence in this Dealership.  If they are incapable of performing a simple detail in two attempts, can they be trusted to perform a simple oil change or a major repair.  That is something they could lie about and I, not being a mechanic, would be none the wiser.  Based on my experience, I felt I was treated as if my time and money were of no importance and value.

DO NOT purchase a vehicle from Mac Churchill Acura in Fort Worth! 

My 83 year old father and recent stroke victim  dropped by Mac Churchill Accra to see what a coupon he received in the mail was worth.  Despite his obvious health issues he ran into ""a very good salesman"" (his words), who sold him a 2009 used Acura MDX for $55,439.42 (actual cost, not including financing).  Comparable MDX's sell for around $30K (even on the Churchill website); new 2012s for around $43K.  It‚Äôs interesting how the salesman‚Äôs name is missing from all of my Dad‚Äôs dealership paperwork, and when we called the dealership to ask they couldn‚Äôt find it either.

My sister met with Mr. Churchill to ask him to take the car back, and he refused because he ""had a signed contract"" (not to mention $25K over market profit). We checked with an attorney who said that dealerships have large legal ""banks"" that will drag cases out until customers pay more in legal fees than their cases are worth. 
We are returning the car to the finance company. Mac Churchill is getting away with scamming $25,000+ out of an 83 year old stroke victim.  My Dad also loses his $8,000 down payment, plus takes a hit in his credit rating. 

I‚Äôve been a teacher for years so I‚Äôm making sure all my current and former students, parents, co-worker‚Äôs, and Facebook friends know what I think of Mac Churchill Acura  and their repulsive, sickening business practices.

735,"May 10, 2012","Went to Mac Churchill with my husband in search of dependable, used car. Raffie was car salesman. We test drove several cars and ended up selecting a 2009 Town & Country van. The van seemed to be what we needed based on size and price as we have a large family. We expressed concern over the keyless entry remote not working. Salesman disappeared, but a service guy tried to assist by changing battery in remote. Still not working. We signed papers on Sat evening and drove car home. We noticed the ""change oil"" light kept coming on and our son expressed the vehicle was hot in the rear area, even with the air on as we drove it Sunday afternoon. Early part of the following week, we called salesman requesting remote be repaired and he stated we needed to come back out to re-sign. When we went back out, re-signed ppwrk based on final financing, etc. Husband explained to salesman key had to be fixed or no deal. After some continued insistence, salesman took car and key to Chrysler dealer down the street and had key re-programmed. Same day we sent car back to service as ""change oil"" light still flashing, even though service dept @ Mac Churchill attempted to reset. We left and went home that evening and picked up children in van. At this point we realized air in back of van blows but does not cool. I called Mac Churchill, got Tanya, she said bring it back. Came back out and waited over an hour. She came back and asked me to bring it back Saturday 5/5 and she would give me a service loaner. As of 5/10, I am still in service loaner. Called dealership, s/w Taylor Jones in service...he said they are trying to determine who will pay for repair as it had to be taken back to Chrysler dealership down the street. Husband and I go back to Mac Churchill and speak w/ Jason Alabarran..explained based on poor service from Day 1..we did not want car..he said OK...give me a few minutes to get contract voided and on your way....they had explained since copy of husbands license had not been obtained, they could not secure financing. Once we said we didnt want to go thru with deal....suddenly financing was secure w/ info from auto insurance company verifying my husband has valid license. At this point, we can decide if we want the air fixed or not...at their expense. Totally unhappy with service and lack of honesty from salesman to sales manager.

While it was being serviced, I was called about other problems being found. One was that a couple of the motor mounts were cracked and also that there was an engine oil leak.  I didn't quite understand what that meant. I failed to ask what would happen if I didn'd get them fixed. The motor mount repair cost about $800 and the oil leak repair costs around $2200. I was quoted the price prior to the repairs. After talking to some people at work, they kind of filled me in as to what those two problems actually were. I feel like I was maybe missled a little bit as to the severity of the problems. I now wish I had waited prior to getting the repairs. I know the main reason I am unhappy is that I had to spend almost $5000 for the service. This makes me feel a little uneasy as to the quality of the Acura.

My latest is that I have always complained since day one of the ""sound"" from the front end. After numerous checkups -- and declaring its normal -- all of a sudden it is EATING my tires up. These tires were put on brand new by the dealer during the certifying process prior to delivery of my car. They DID NOT use manufacturers parts or recommended tires, and therefore will not warranty the work. Less than have the recommended wear on my tires-- and only owning this vehicle for 9 months--I am told the tires are in need of replacement.

They have always treated me as a valued customer and, over the years, friend. From Mac himself, through the sales and service staff, I have always been treated in an outstanding manner. Because I put very few miles on my vehicles, Kimmie Hamilton has become my personal service advisor--continually devising a service plan to meet my unusual driving habits and ensuring that my vehicles are superbly maintained. I rely upon Kimmie. If my adult children have a problem or concern with their Acuras, I send them to Kimmie.

753,"March 29, 2012","I bought a vehicle from this dealership in August of last year. We had a contract to fix a few things and those things were taken care of promptly and properly. A couple of months later my vehicle broke down and was towed to the dealership. When I got there to talk with them as the van was being dropped off, I asked if my warrant deductible was per visit or problem. Since it was per visit I mentioned that my A/C was not working and asked that it be looked at. A couple of hours later I was called with a quote to fix my van, after some haggling a price was set so that the pulley system could be fixed. There was no mention of the AC and I assumed that all of that issue was covered by my warrant and fixed. I picked up my van and drove home. A couple of weeks later the weather warmed up and I noticed that my AC was not blowing cold air. I called to ask if the AC had even been looked at and was told to see line 4, I asked for an explanation as to what that meant on my reciept because I was obviously unaware. The person I worked with was not very nice so I ended the conversation. Again the weather got cooler and the AC wasnt a big issue, bad idea to let this go! Well as always in Texas it warmed up again and at the same time my 6 Disk changer jammed a CD which would not allow my navagation screen to close. I called the dealership to set up an appt to fix both problems and was told my CD player was not covered under my warranty. Big news to me because the finance manager who worked with us specifically said that the coverage we picked was perfect because if one of our kids pulled the DVD screen down and broke it we would be covered. Well I guess he got our coverage wrong because this was not the case. I called and spoke with one of the finance managers and told him the issues I had had, he said he would look into it but never returned my call. The next week I called and asked for the general manager of the dealership and was sent to his voicemail. The next day the finance manager I worked with on my contract when I purchased the vehicle called and again said he would look into it and call me back. It took a week or so and I called again and he called and apologized and said he was out of town on a family emergency. A week later he called and said that the warranty could be upgraded for a fee, not having the money at that time I told him I would let him know in a few days and asked if he could make an appt for me to bring in my van so the AC could be rechecked(they did offer to do this for no money but I couldnt get a hold of the service tech who was supposed to help me). He said he would call me back and as of today I have not heard from him. Im not sure as to my options at this point and I have no cold air blowing out of my AC in this hot weather! The first service person I worked with when I brought my van in for the We Owe/You Owe contract was very nice to work with but other than that my expieriance was horrible and I will never refer anyone to this dealership.

The wife and I decided long ago that Acura offers the best combination of value, content, quality and price, and even though there are other Acura dealers in our area, we always go back to Churchill. 

The main reason we do is because Sharbel, the GM, always tends to us personally, and he cuts right to the chase and gives us the fairest deal he can without the usual car-buying nonsense. The general sales staff are knowledgeable and helpful, too. In addition, Mr. Churchill himself is directly involved in the business and is a personable and customer-friendly gentleman. 

Our experiences with the service department have always been excellent, too, although our Acuras don't tend to need much service beyond regular maintenance.

What a lesson for my 9 year old who was with me how to completely ruin repeat business and positive referrals.
 
After three hours of haggling a monthly payment with Mo (yes I know) I had to wait till the finance man to see the sale price of the car, my trade in value and loan points. 

Had to haggle in the finance office. The price jumped 30 bucks a month with this guy.  So tired of hearing, ""comon, meet me halfway"".  

 Finally walked out, demanded they ""un valet"" my car and give me back my keys. Ultimately, I got the car I wanted for the price I wanted. But they still screwed me in the end.

 I went back to finalize the paperwork the next day and get the other keys and fob to the car. I was told ""Oh sorry, you bought it as is"".  No freaking way.  You only have one key and no fob?   Seriously? This HAS to be one of the top two worst car buying experiences ever. I asked to talk to ""Chris"" the GM. He avoided me and sent the ""business manager"" to placate me. Business Manager says, ""we're slammed today, Come back Monday and we'll try to scrounge up a fob for you""  These guys suck. Avoid at all costs.",1.3

I met Sharbel Lattouf almost 2 years ago, anytime I see him our conversations continue from the last one, which shows me he is truly listening and possesses what I feel business is losing which is customer relationships.  

I received a call from Cisco Nieves approx. 7 months ago attempting to offer an upgrade.  He had a pleasant persistence about him, even though the upgrade could not happen a the time.  He called me about about two weeks ago, remembering exactly what was important to me as if we had spoken with me the previous day.  He was persistent without being annoying coupled wih humor.  

Most people are anxious and don't enjoy going into F&amp;I, Michael West made it a pleasant experience as well as being very thorough.  I had been through F&amp;I before and was never informed of the options that were available.

Don Boothe in service jumped to the opportunity to assist me with something I needed to send to Acura mfg. on my previous TSX.  He could have instructed me on what to do instead of attending to it himself.

I'm not at all surprised to see lots of 1-star ratings wishing they could give none. Well here is another. I called MCA this morning to see if they still had a pre-owned Lexus IS250 that is listed on their website. They said it is available and asked if I would I like to make an appointment to see it -&quot;as part of their VIP program&quot;. Sure! I gave them my info and was given an apporointment confirmation#(23810385) and instructed to arrive at 3pm and ask for Tony or Mike (both directors of pre-owned vehicles). I arrived at 3pm and thought it was strange that neither Tony or Mike cared to come out of their dark tinted glass cube to greet a &quot;VIP&quot; customer. So a sales guy Gene went to get the car. After 20 minutes (yes 20, maybe more) he came back with keys to an RX350 and said isn't that what you asked me for? I said no IS250 and lets just walk out to where it is b/c I don't have time to wait on you to drive it around. And that's when he told me that he didn't think they had it anymore. So walked into the tinted glass cube to speak with Tony and Mike and explained my story. And they said &quot;oh yeah, well we wholesaled that car like an hour ago&quot; COMPLETLY missing the fact that I had made an oppointment with his company to come look at the car. His response? &quot;Yeah well, I'm sorry man, don't know what to tell you. We do have a lot of other cars on the lot I could show you it you'd like to....&quot;. Are you kidding me! I was blown away that these guys did not understand the problem! I had driven almost an hour to come see the car (for which I had an APPOINTMENT) and they wholesaled it &quot;like an hour ago&quot;. I asked to speak to the owner of the dealership and got Sharbel Lattouf (I was kinda expecting Mac Churchill). So I have no idea if this is the owner or not. Anyway, I explained my situation and got the same response. Amazing! If I‚Äôm VIP, I feel real sorry for you poor non-VIP customers!! The stereotypical reputation of &quot;used car sales&quot; from years gone by is alive and well at Mac Churchill Acura, Fort Worth, Tx. Very slimy. If these are the tactics you use to get people on the lot, I foresee new ownership in the near future at Mac Churchill Acura -and the new owner will have gotten a great deal in bankruptcy court.",1.0
786,"March 01, 2012","After signing contract and paying down payment, saleperson tried to sell a different car by marking out VIN and putting in a different one without buyer's approval. Told my parents the car they test drove was sold. Later they admitted it was not sold, but they just wanted to sell them the one that had been in the lot longer. Refused to honor contract for car that was test driven and had a down payment in hand.

Update:
My Fellow Consumers,
I just received an e-mail from the dealer threatening to sue me.  In my opinion, a clear attempt at intimidation, but the funny thing is that in his e-mail, he says that I was trying to intimidate him by telling him that I was going to add more information to my posts.  Here are the three things that I am adding that he calls intimidation.  

1)  They admit to making mistakes and trying to switch the vehicles after presenting the wrong vehicle and letting my parents test-drive.  Here are excerpts from e-mails from the dealership: 
a. ‚ÄúAll the sales desk was trying to do is sell an older identical vehicle with actually less miles which my sales consultant should have pulled up the first time.‚Äù

b. ‚ÄúDid we make mistakes, probably; with six hundred vehicles and twenty-five sales people, errors are bound to happen on occasion‚Äù

2)  I offered to pay (if they passed) for a lie detector tests for the two salespeople so they can clear their name regarding the following that I am stating what my parents said happened.  They haven‚Äôt taken me up on that offer.
a. Their salesperson took a $3k deposit/down check from my parents.

b. Their salesperson tried to tell them that a different car‚Äîthat was actually sandwiched in between other cars‚Äîwas the one they test-drove.

c. Their salesperson told them that the car they test-drove was sold, and that was why they couldn't buy the car they test-drove.  He later admitted that this was not true.

d. Documents that the dealership presented for review with the VIN that they test-drove, were changed to show the VIN of the car the dealership wanted to sell to them without my parent‚Äôs prior knowledge.

3)  My personal information was sent out via EXTREMELY unsecure e-mail by the dealer. I have the e-mails to prove that this was done.  This includes things like partial SSNs, addresses, and phone numbers.

These are all facts and somehow this is me trying to intimidate him?  He‚Äôs threatening to pursue legal actions if I ‚Äúdo not remove the current posts‚Äù.  Who‚Äôs trying to intimidate who?

Just in case any prior review is not clear.  I will summarize the facts to clarify:
1) I negotiated the price on a car via e-mail with Carlo.
2) I talked to Carlo on the phone.  I said, my parents want to test-drive the car before they buy it.
3) When they arrived, John helped them.  They test-drove the car and wanted to buy it.
4) They gave salesman John the deposit of $3k for the car they test-drove.  The VIN of the car they test-drove was on some of the documents John reviewed with them.
5) My mom told me that she saw the car they test-drove get driven away so she went to ask John where the car was.  My parents told me that salesman (John) pointed to a different car‚Äîthat was completely sandwiched amongst multiple cars‚Äîand told them ‚ÄúThis is it‚Äù.  
6) In my opinion, that false statement was clearly to induce my parents to get to contract on the vehicle.  I believe this is called misrepresentation.  
7) My parents then told me that salesman (John) then said that they made a mistake and the car they test-drove was actually sold.   In my opinion, another false statement clearly made to induce my parents to buy a car.  Once again, I believe this is called misrepresentation.
8) Salesman (John) then actually told me in a phone conversation that they wanted to sell a different car and not the one that was test-driven.  He admitted to me that the car that they test-drove was actually not sold.
9) The documents that my parents reviewed now had a different VIN with the first VIN scratched out. My parents told me that this was done without their knowledge or consent.  (I have copies of some of these documents).
10) After a lot of back and forth with the dealership, the general manager had the audacity to tell me that ‚ÄúWhether the vehicle was or wasn‚Äôt sold at the time is also immaterial‚Äù.  I think having a customer test drive a car and not caring if it had been sold or not is very material.   However, as detailed in #7 and #8 above, it wasn‚Äôt sold.  In my opinion, that was simply said to make my parents okay with the swap.

In their e-mails, they constantly talk about how big of a dealership they are, the number of cars, the number of sales people; based on their pride in these big numbers, I guess I am just one customer among many.  Their customer service reflected it.  I‚Äôve learned my lesson with this dealership.  I‚Äôll always love Acura since I have bought a TL, MDX and helped buy an RL in the last ten years.  However, in the future, I‚Äôll work with a smaller dealership that cares about even one customer.  Based on my personal interaction and the way my parents told me they were treated, in my opinion, caring about every customer is not the mindset of the employees (salesman - John, internet sales manager - Carlo, and the general manager - Sharbel) that I dealt with at Mac Churchill Acura.  I haven‚Äôt dealt with any of the other employees, but the other negative reviews I have read seem to reflect similar experiences

792,"January 03, 2012","Chanon provided the following price quotes:
2012 Acura TL Tech 
MSRP - 40,220 
Your Price - 34,220

If you do your research on the internet then you will know that the destination charge is already included in the MSRP. I asked additional questions to compare to other dealer quotes. Please note that there were no disclaimers provided in the quote. My inquiries were unanswered and I had wanted to make a purchase before end of year.  The automated email system asked if my questions were answered and I replied &quot;no&quot; to both Chanon and the general manager. Carlo (Internet Sale Director) called to apologize and he seemed agitated that I had responded to the system generated email from the general manager. He stated he had provided the answers to my questions to Chanon and those should have been sent to me days earlier. He proceeded to tell me that the car would be $1775 above the quote that Chanon provided. He explained that they would be adding a destination charge which should already be there since it was contained in the MSRP. The options they included were at full retail price. He  really did not seem to want to sell the car because he kept throwing up obstacles. Essentially, he priced the car so high that they were no longer the best price and had mislead me. He could not answer any of my questions:

- Why would you quote a price you know to be untruthful and misleading? 
- Why would you quote a price you are not willing to sell the vehicle for? 
- Where is the integrity and honesty?
- Why is it acceptable to mislead potential customers?
- Does it make sense that a customer would pay twice for the destination charge? or full retail price for options they did not choose?

I feel that the Mac Churchill dealership including Carlo, Chanon, and the general manager have been dishonest and are unwilling to admit it. They were caught in a lie. I emailed the general manager with same questions. No response was received. I have been apparently been removed from their email system and I no longer receive emails asking whether I have questions.

Please be very careful in dealing with Mac Churchill. They can't be trusted.",1.7
793,"December 24, 2011","I made contact with the Internet Sales team at Mac Churchill in June, 2011, and we began a dialog that lasted nearly six months. Chanon was the ""lead dog"" over that time. He made periodic contact with me, was always polite and low-key, and gave me timely information that helped me make my decision. When I went to the dealership to look around in person, Chanon met me, showed me the car I was interested in buying, and worked with the business staff to get a great rate for me. I went back the next day to buy. Chanon was tied up with another customer, so he paired me with Mark Smith, an old pro in the business and a great guy to talk with. Mark stayed with me all afternoon as we moved the deal to completion. Most important, he made sure that other salespeople were aware that I was buying one particular car, a beautiful red TSX Special Edition. (I guess there were a lot of other potential buyers who also craved my car!) At the end of the day, I drove home a very happy customer without a hint of ""buyer remorse."" The Mac Churchill dealership is a great place to go for buying and service. Almost everyone there is friendly (there were a few long faces, but it was a dark and stormy night), the facilities are clean and well-appointed, and the Keurig coffee maker never runs dry! I've gone back to take advantage of the free car wash and to pick up my plates; each time, I was greeted warmly, served promptly, and sent away happy. I would certainly buy my next car there, and I recommend Mark and Chanon highly as good people to work with.",4.6
794,"December 21, 2011","To describe my experience here as poor would be generous.  

I went with my wife and kid to by a gently used MDX.  The car that I wanted to see (and was told would be on the lot) had been sold the day before I arrived.  Instead they showed me an alternative that was close but not what I wanted.  Before they would do this though, they employed a very high pressure tactic to get personal information.  They then took my license (which is standard practice) but did not give it back (which is certainly not standard). I called for three straight weeks and got the run around - never did get the license back though.  Thanks MacChurchill!

By the way... the car I was interested in was a 2010 MDX with 17000 miles.  I found other certified acuras (multiple) for half the miles, a year younger, and less expensive elsewhere.  They simply refused to negotiate.  Not sure why they are so much expensive than the other acura dealerships.  Must be all that 'great service'.  Best avoid them altogether if you can",1.5
795,"December 13, 2011","Let me preface this store by saying that we drove over an hour to this dealership because of the many used Acura TL's listed online in their inventory.

As soon as we arrived, we were swarmed by salesman at our car and immediately taken inside to sit at someone‚Äôs desk. Before we even began to talk about the cars I was interested in, this salesperson insisted that I give him all of my person information (address, phone number, email). We finally got to talking about the car that I had come to see and what I was interested in. He then mentioned that he was going to go get a car so that we could test drive it. We had to ask what he was going to go get, and are glad we did because we had to correct him on what we were there to see. After being gone over 20 minutes he came back in and said that he now needed to get the key for the car. He knew which car to get, so why didn‚Äôt he grab the key when he first went outside? Finally, he comes back with a 08 TL. The car had more wear and tear than on my current car which is 8 years old. I immediately told him that I was not interested in the car. He then mentioned that I might be interested in a newer TSX and we agreed. This time, he took about 30 minutes to find a car and then had to return to find the keys. The car he ended up bringing us had black interior. I mentioned numerous times that I wanted a car with tan interior and a navigation system. This car had neither and so we abruptly left, very frustrated. 

While standing inside of the dealership waiting on our salesman to return with the car he had set out to find, numerous sales people asked if we had been helped because they could sense the frustration on our faces. One even mentioned that it seemed that we were waiting for an abnormally long time. They all mentioned that they would look into why it was taking so long, ect but none did. As soon as we walked to our car to leave, the used car manager came running out. He mentioned that he was sorry for the bad experience and that he would help. We were so frustrated that no one had tried to help us earlier that we left.
I have read through the other reviews, and it seems that every time a negative review is written the dealership blames the individual for the horrible experience. I understand that they have received awards for being a wonderful dealership, but that does not mean that every experience is wonderful. I for one experience horrible customer service.

796,"December 06, 2011","It's been a month (pur on October 26, 2011) since I've purchased my 2008 Honda Civic. I was able to get a price that I was able to afford but not until after hours of negotiating. 

Upon arriving, I had contacted Shannon directly to let him know I was interesting in the Civic that was featured on autotrader. When I arrived, David came to greet me, I ended up having to wait about 10-15 minutes before he actually got back to me. Once we sat down, he of course asked what I was able to afford and is already trying to negotiate the price before I actually saw the car. I brought a friend with me for support and when she asked David if I can actually see the car before going into numbers, David replied in a very rude tone with a long smartass remark. When I told David what is the cut off amount I can afford, he finally showed me the car. The car itself had hail damage on the roof, hood, and trunk. I told David that I was not interested in buying a car with hail damage but he suggested that we try and make a deal. The car was advertised as $13,950 if I remembered correctly. So with everything added together tt and license it would be around $15,000. I was originally approved by my bank for $14,000, which is what I can afford. (I'm a part time working college student) I had told everyone that if they are not willing to give me the car for $14,000 with the hail damage fixed then I will not purchase it. Throughout the negotiation, the salesmen informed me that it wouldn't be a deal to them which I replied that I understand it might not yield a profit to them and will gladly leave. They wanted me to purchase the car so they agreed to give me the car for $14,00 with hail damage fixed. 

I ended up not using my preapproved loan because the deal we had made was that they will fix my hail damage. I had to go through the dealership's financing which doesn't make any sense because they sold the car to me for $14,000. I realized that they wanted to cut me a check back for $500 so that ""I can use on something else"" rather than fix my hail damage so in turn I'd buy the car for $13,500 as is. I told the David from the very beginning that I want this (hail damage) fixed. I was even given the suggestion that when there is a next hail storm, I can go through my insurance company to get it all fixed (when is there going to be another hail storm?). They let me take the car home that night with a verbal agreement (he wouldn't give it to me in writing no matter how much I pestered) that once they receive the funds for the car and cut me the check, I can use that $500 to fix the hail damage with the dealership's dent repairman. 

About a couple weeks had gone by, David had called me because I was missing some signatures on my paperwork, mind you I live in Grand Prairie so it is a far drove to Fort Worth. I went up to the dealership the next day and David was not there, I checked with the finance department and they informed me that everything was set and ready to go. I was very frustrated because I had driven up to Fort Worth for no reason. I ran into Shannon and I was able to get an inspection sticker and oil change. 

About a week later, I got a call from my finance guy Dare and was informed that my check is ready,(this would be around November 11, 2011) I later called David to see when the best time I can come in to fix my car. He said that it would be okay to come in at any time. I ended up coming up to Fort Worth November 16, 2011 and I had brought along my boyfriend because I was informed that I may not have a car to drive while my car is getting fixed. Apparently, David did not let the dent repairmen Jason know that I was coming that day and he had no room in his schedule to fix my car. As a result, I wasted my time again going to Fort Worth. Not only did he waste my time, he also wasted my boyfriend's time because he had to get off of work earlier than usual and drive from Dallas to get to the dealership. I made plans with Jason to come in two weeks later. What frustrates me is that David did not let Jason know I was coming or else he would have put me in the queue.  

Finally, on November 30, 2011 more than a month later after I had bought my car, I came up to the dealership by myself so that I wouldn't risk wasting anymore of anyone's time to drop my car off. David got in touch with Jason and they were able to take the car. Since the beginning of this whole ordeal David was unsure whether he can lend me a car to borrow. I bought my car for a reason, because I need it. I go to work and school during odd times, I can't always get the ride I need. David had asked I am guessing management to see if I can borrow a car and he came back and informed me that the dealership is going through an audit and cannot lend out a car unless someone is buying a car (I bought a car already, doesn't that count?). I then had to call my uncle to come pick up at the dealership. David also suggested that I should bring the car in at my most convenient time if that day wasn't a good day, are you kidding me? It's been over a month, I am not going to come back to this place again and get screwed over each and every time. 
 
Jason was able to get my hail damage fixed fairly quickly, as for him, he did a great job, not only did he fix the hail damage he did fix other dings around my car. 

As far as going to this dealership, I will NEVER suggest this dealership to anyone because even though I had a fairly good deal, I had to work very hard to make it happen. I shouldn't have been treated the way that David had treated me. Don't EVER go to David Diamond when you plan on going to buy a car. He will rip you off, from what I've heard.

802,"August 11, 2011","One of the worst experiences I've had at a dealership ever. And that's saying a lot. My wife and I went in to look at an 07 BMW 328i after exchanging conversations with a new salesman named Jonathon. We get there and are asked 3 times to go inside before we even get the chance to see the car we'd come to look at! No thanks - we want to see the car. Jonathon comes out, we ask to test drive it, and we get in to drive it.  We're almost out of the parking lot when I see the gas light is on, and I mention it to my wife. So we then have to turn around and drive to the back of the dealership so they can put gas in the car. Fine, not a big deal.  We drive it, we like it, we're ready to talk.  I'm very honest and upfront when I ask them the least they would accept for the car. We don't want to haggle, go back and forth 5 times, over and over. It was already late, and we had our 10-month old son with us. They come back and say the price is non-negotiable from the price we saw online. Okay, fair enough, that's too high, we decide to leave. We get out of the door, and Jonathon and his training salesman come running out to stop us and ask what we would offer for the car. I'm upfront and tell him a price we felt comfortable with. He balked and said it was too low, we need to meet in the middle, etc., etc.  I insist that they've already lied to me by saying they wouldn't take less than the internet price, yet he's haggling right then! I finally come up in our offer, but then there's an issue with our trade-in car - and Jonathon says the difference could be made up by them offering more for our trade-in than it's really worth in order to satisfy the banks (???) and make it look better for them.  I told him I didn't care how they got to the price as long as they eventually got there. He assured me that he could get to the price I'd told him if we just come back in and let him work a bit. So I convince my wife, we go back in and sit back down.  He disappears for a few minutes, then returns with a price $2,500 higher than what we'd agreed to and a trade-in offer of $500!! For an 01 Volvo S40 that is in GREAT condition, worth $3000 KBB trade-in. I immediately get chapped with this because now they're lying to us, wasting our time, playing games, and keeping my son up late. I tell them this is way too high, and there's NO WAY our car is only worth $500 as a trade.  He then asks me to sign my name on a paper saying we would buy if he could get it down to the price we originally agreed to!! If he could do that, why hadn't he already?!?! I was honest and upfront the entire time, and they were anything but. He then starts arguing with me, telling me that I'm expecting too much, dealerships don't work the way I want them to, blah, blah, blah.  I KNOW how they work, thanks! In fact, we'd purchased a car a week before by doing exactly the same thing we did here!! The difference was the salesman then was honest and didn't overpromise anything and didn't waste my time trying to play this whole haggle game.  I refuse to play that. And if you want my business and want to sell me a car, you'll be honest with me.  When I ask the lowest you'll go, don't tell me one thing and then come back 2 more times with lower amounts! That means you're lying to me. And if you're lying to me, you don't respect me. Eventually I thanked them for their time, told them I was tired of being lied to and jerked around, and left with my wife and son.  We'll never go back there, and we will go out of our way to warn others about going there. Absolutely horrible experience. ",1.8
803,"July 28, 2011","I would classify myself as an informed buyer-I did literally days of research before buying this car. It is a car that my wife told me about months ago and we really didn't seriously consider buying now or need because her car was only two years old and in perfect condition. 
I had spoken to a number of dealers, and two of them were dealing in good faith, while two were actually insulting in their offers. It is possible for a buyer who desires to to inform himself about all aspects of the car price and the value of his trade.
To make a long story short, Carlo gave me the best price I got after days of dealing with others in less than five minutes with no haggling. He didn't have my car in stock, but he got it for us the next day. Our total time at this dealership was two hours start to finish. Everything was exactly as promised, the car was in perfect condition, and all functions of it were explained to us.
The experience could not have been any better.

804,"July 08, 2011","The thought of buying my first car was exciting until I ended up getting taken advantage of by their salesman. The salesman guaranteed the car himself and for Mac and said the car had been inspected and there were no problems, I made it clear that me and my baby would be in this car all the time so it needed to be safe. He knew I didn't know much about fixing or even buying cars and so I end up getting stuck with an 02 MDX that has wharped rotors, the rear a/c won't blow and things seem to fall off randomly (a/c vents, rear view mirror, etc...) Onay was so persistent in selling this car to me that he had my husband cosign without being there  OR signing papers. I didn't even have insurance for the vehicle! Now the bank calls me and tells me I neeed full coverage not liability and once again I'm a first time buyer, he knew that and didn't tell me...Now my loan is not finalized and I had a trade in w/ down payment. I DIDN'T EVEN GET MY CONTRACT PAPERS! So I called the director of sales and he tells me that I can give the car back but now my credit will be ruined and I can't get another car? I guess they just like to treat people like dirt!",1.6
805,"June 09, 2011"," We spent all day one saturday looking for a car. After hours and hours of looking and test driving for the one that we wanted, we finally found the one that my wife and I  both liked. After haggling a little bit over the price, both the dealer and my wife and I all came to an agreement on the car that we wanted. We agreed on terms and filled out the paperwork. We drove the car home that night. 
 The following friday (six days later), I received a phone call from our salesman and he said that we needed to come in and fill out the loan paperwork once again because there had been a change and everyone needed new paperwork. As we started the 40 mile trip to do this, our salesman called several times letting us know a little more. About two miles from the dealership, we were finally told that we needed to pick another car. 
  Upon arriving at the dealer, we were told that the finance company had faxed back their offer and that they were not willing to provide financing for the car we wanted because it had &amp;quot;too many miles&amp;quot;. A later conversation with our finance company shed light on the fact that finance companies don't care how many miles are on the vehicles. While at the dealer, we were shown the offer from the finance company and nowhere on the paperwork was anything or any communication about the fact that there were too many miles on this car. I told them that I didn't believe what they were telling me and that we would bring the car back to them the next day and get our down payment back. At that point, a dealership employee went and pulled another car behind our car to prevent us from leaving. Upon futher pressing, one of the used car &amp;quot;managers&amp;quot; slipped and said that the mileage really didn't matter and that they would not drop the price on the car that we wanted because that's not the way that they did business.
  At that point, things were getting very heated and Hans and Franz, the used car managers, were letting their true intentions be known. My wife seeked out and found Chris who identified himself as the Sales Manager. I was disappointed when he continued to spout the company line about the car having too many miles but he seemed to genuinely want to help us get into another vehicle. It was either that or he just wanted to get us out of the dealership.  
  We test drove several other vehicles and finally picked out a trade in that they had just got in. We signed the paperwork and agreed to bring the car back the next week to have some problems on it fixed. The service dept was great and they fixed everything that was wrong with the car. It is a good car and we got a good deal on it but it was not the car that we originally wanted. 
  I can honestly say that the next time we buy a vehicle, be it new or used, it will not be from a Mac Chrurchill dealer. The sales experience that we had was horrible and we were treated less that human upon our return trip to sign the additional paperwork. I don't appreciate being lied to and will use this experience to tell other people to steer clear of this dealer.

I talked to the salesman and told him I only wanted to see where I was with my car and get my monthly payments lowered. I also told him if I traded my car in I would not be trading it in how it sits and that I would be taking off my aftermarket parts and replacing them with the OEM parts. He told me that was fine. 
After about an hour of negotiating on the car that I wanted we reached an agreeable price for a Black/Black TL with some nice upgraded wheels and the OE front, side and rear spoilers.
In negotiating there was a lot of pressure to get me into the vehicle, which affected my decision. When everything was said and done, they told me they could not put me in the vehicle we negotiated on as is and they put me in a different vehicle. I went back a few days later and talked to the sales GM and he told me that we were not negotiating on this TL, but a Technology TL. He went to get the paper work and could not find the original paper work with the negotiations. 
I had to sign paperwork 2 times because they had the wrong VIN on the original paper work.

816,"April 26, 2011","I was shopping for a new vehicle and had been cross shopping mid-sized sedeans to replace my Infiniti G35, which was passed down to another family member.  

I shopped many local dealerships in the DFW area, Audi, Lexus, Acura, and BMW.  I came as I was, street clothes, somewhat intentionally as I've met many a salesperson who judged me right away simply from my clothing.  

BMW in Fort Worth and the Lexus in GP gave me horrible service, simply trying to rush me back out the door, the BMW 535i was at the top of my list followed by the albeit smaller but fun IS350.  

Put off by the sale people I went to the Audi in Irving and received very good service looking at an A4, but aside from the incredible interior, something left me wanting for more. 

Since I was already up in the northern area of DFW, I travelled to Mac Churchill Acura, and it was well worth the distance.  I met a great sales person who treated me like I was the most important person he's ever met.  He put me into an incredible black on black TL, and within about an hour, I was sold.  The test drive was fun and really gave me a feel for the car, the interior is as good as the Audi, which is high praise for a car that once wasn't much nicer than an Accord. 

The employees at that dealership we exceptionally nice, quick, and very courteous.  We had a little trouble nailing down the price, but it was still a few thousand less than the Audi or BMW and on par with the Lexus, but offered way more space and tech. 

David walked me through the whole process with the dealer financing, and I was out the door in a short afternoon.  They train their staff there very well, and I never once the person that was rushed was me.  They took their time with me, and we quick with the work they needed to do. 

TL:DR; If I could rate this dealer higher than a 5, I would.",5.0
817,"April 25, 2011","In February 2011, Cisco in sales and Dare in Finance helped me get into their last 2010 TL. I wasn‚Äôt crazy about the location of the dealership due to Friday rush hour traffic on 820 but my car buying experience paid off in the end. My previous vehicle was a 2009 Toyota Camry and I was really overwhelmed with all the perks the TL has to offer. The process took awhile only because I had so many questions in regards to financing and the additional products they offer. Cisco offered to set up the blue tooth for my Iphone while I was working with Dare on the paperwork. ",5.0
818,"April 24, 2011","I will be honest, this was the first dealership that I have ever dealt with in my life.  I have heard horror stories from other people about dealerships and purchasing cars in general, needless to say I walked in nervous and walked out with a huge smile on my face.  I told Chris what I wanted, how much I could finance, and that I was a first time buyer.  We worked together and made it happen.  
A few months later it was time to get my first oil change, I was directed to Kimmi Hamilton.  He was wonderful to work with and had my car ready as soon as he could.  When it comes time to purchase my next car I will most definately make the hour and a half drive to MacChurchill without a second thought.  It will probably be the first and last dealership that I deal with and I am always telling people that it is worth the drive. 

Thanks for the WONDERFUL experience guys!",5.0
819,"April 23, 2011","The BEST experience ever! Coming from a background in the automotive industry I have visited, observed, and purchased from many other dealerships in the DFW area,NEVER again.. I will gladly go to Mac Churchill Acura again & AGAIN.. I have personally purchased 3 vehicles in the past 2 years from Mac Churchill Acura and have only positive things to say, I can go on and on forever.
They have a very real and friendly staff, and are always more than willing to go the extra mile to answer any questions I may have. EVERY visit to Mac Churchill whether it be to trade, purchase, or have service done on my vehicles; I have always been able to get in, out and on my way in a timely manner -no problem!
If ever we were to encounter any bumps in the process of working a deal, everything has always been explained to me and resolved. Where else can you honestly shop and get this kind of EXCELLENT service!? I drive nearly an hour and half plus from North Dallas just to simply get an oil change because I know that I will be well taken care of. I have been referring all my friends and family to this dealership and will continue to recommend them to anyone I meet that is shopping for a car. Buying a car is a serious purchase and you should only shop where you will be taken seriously. Not to mention competitive pricing, no one has been able to even come close to the great deals I have gotten on my last 3 purchases.
THANK YOU! To the wonderful team @ Mac Churchill that I have had the pleasure dealing with time and time again. You will be seeing more of me in the years to come along with a new large following from the North Dallas area. Keep doing what you do best!",5.0
820,"April 23, 2011","Last year, I purchased a certified pre-owned 2006 Acura TSX from David McDavid Acura in Plano. I received a Carfax report which showed that it had not been in any accidents. 

After receiving a mailer claiming that they would give you 120% of the black book value for your vehicle, we made a two-hour trip to Fort Worth yesterday to see what they would give me for my car. I actually called them to make sure they would honor the offer before we made the drive. We arrived around 1:15p, and finally sat down to work the numbers around 5:00 or 5:30p. They had inspected my car, and came back with an offer $6400 less than I owed, because they said my vehicle had been in an accident!

I told them my vehicle had a Carfax report showing that it had never had body work, and I certainly have not been in an accident, so that was news to me. I wanted to walk out, but the sales guy, Onay, wanted to go back to his manager - so we did that two or three times. I was ready to walk away, but my husband felt that we had wasted too much time to do that, so we leased the MDX - for more down, fewer miles, and a higher payment than I wanted. They got top dollar for their vehicle, and I get bottom dollar. Funny how that works! Mac Churchill thinks I got a great deal and a fair price for my car. I totally disagree.

I wish I had listened to my gut, because today I called David McDavid to let them know what had happened. Of course, they are telling me that I should have brought my car back to them, and they would have given me at least $3,000 more than Churchill. they also say that their mechanic found no problems with my car when they purchased it in December of 2009, so they old us a car with no problems. 

One or both dealerships are not shooting straight They're clearly just out to protect themselves. 

I asked Mac Churchill if I could return the MDX and get my car back. His response?  NO. The paperwork has already been processed. So I'm screwed.

Next time, I need to listen to my gut and walk out. But right now, I don't think I ever want to do business with any car dealership again.",2.5
821,"March 24, 2011","I would not waste your time with this dealership. They send me a flyer in the mail that alluded that I would get 120% of Blackbook for my existing vehicle and I could purchase a new Acura Tsx for 80% of the retail value, which they will not actually do when you get there.

When I called on the phone they insisted that they could do this when I would come in, but when I actually walked in, everything all of the sudden changed. All they tried to do is show me some payments, but as soon as insisted that I would pay cash, they could not match what they said they would.",1.0

I submitted a request for an online price quote and was quickly responded to by Cheryl Warren.  She offered me an incredibly good price on the new car, an excellent offer on my trade and made the whole process easy and painless.

Only one other dealership has come close to the wonderful experiences I have had at Mac Churchill Acura.  This is my second vehicle to purchase there and I am sure to be back again.  Everyone I dealt with from Mr. Smith meeting me at my car when I arrived, in the rain nonetheless, to the finance officer who finished the deal, worked with me to get me everything I wanted or expected with regard to my vehicle.  I was in and out in about 4 hours driving my new vehicle.  The atmosphere at the dealership was upbeat and relaxed.  This experience is by far the best.  They even exceeded my expectations based on my previous experience there.  Kudos to Mark and everyone who made this possible.",4.8

826,"October 03, 2010","Purchased my Acura TL SH-AWD w/tech 9/25/2010. I was almost ready to purchase another vehicle at a different dealership. Test drove the Acura TL and was impressed.  Luis showed me a number of cars with the accessories I wanted.  He really worked hard to find a car I would be happy with. After the 4th car, he suggested the TL SH-AWD that was in the showroom.  I looked at it and said ""SOLD"".  I had seen it when we went into the showroom but the interior was dark - not a good thing in this Texas heat.  It was suggested that the windows be coated with a heat barrior.  Decided to buy this car and have the windows coated.  Luis stayed until all the paperwork completed and the car washed.  It was almost 9:00 pm when my husband and I left the dealership with the new car.  

The windows were coated, and the accessories I purchased were done Friday 10/1.  
When we came back to pick up the TL, Luis went over again some functions of the NAV and paired up our new cell phones.  Our former cells were not compatible with the Acura. It took longer than we thought to complete this chore.  The new phones weren't cooperating.  But Luis finally got everything to work.  We greatly apprefiate all his efforts.  

He was right.  With the coating on the windows, the car is much cooler when left in the sun.  After only one week, I'm extremely satisfied with the car.  This car has more power than I am used to.  My previous car was a 4 cyl.-this car moves.

I came in looking for a TL w/tech and walked out with a TL SH-AWD.  There is a difference in cars.  ",5.0
827,"September 19, 2010","I have purchased two new Acuras from Mac Churchill. Both times the buying experience was great. After driving a '05 TSX for five years, I upgraded to a TL. I never had to go back to the dealership for any problems with the TSX except for two recalls that took less than an hour each to be completed. The service department was great and the coffee machine in the waiting area is amazing.

My buying experience with Luis was great. He helped me focus in on exactly what I wanted and I left with the perfect car for my wife and me at a reasonable price.

828,"September 02, 2010","When I got there I was left alone more than I was spoken to. However I liked the car I was shown. We were able to agree on a deal. I traded my car in, paid my down, signed the proper paperwork and left in a new car. 6 days later Henry my salesman calls asking me to bring a few more things. So I take part of the day of work to bring it to them. Keep in mind I have signed ALL my paperwork and I changed over my insurance. They then tell me because I am self employed, which they new from the start, that I am going to need a co-signer. I went home in my old car almost a week after signing my note. Im sure there great if you are an easy sale but if you have bumps to over come you are treated like yesterdays trash! ",1.0
829,"August 07, 2010","On May 13, 2010, I went to Mac Churchill Acura in Fort Worth, Texas to purchase the advertised 2010 Acura TL SH AWD w/TECH at the advertised price of $6.  There were not any restrictions, stipulations, or limitations stated in the ad. 

It is my understanding that the law states that a dealership cannot sell a vehicle for more than the advertised price (even if the customer is unaware of the advertised price.) 


I am of the opinion that the $6 price is a mistake someone knew they were making.  It is marketing strategy for the purpose of getting customers to buy something else, or in this matter the same vehicle at a higher price.

To add further insult to injury, my character was defamed by representatives of the dealership in writing.

830,"December 21, 2009",They were very friendly and worked hard to help us get to our price. I felt like I could trust what they were saying. I hate to feel like I am being pressured and I did not once feel under pressure. Overall it was a positve experience. I had dealt with two dealers who were closer to my house but could get what I needed.,5.0
831,"December 11, 2009","I recently purchased a certified vehicle, alledgely 150 point inspection, right??? I drove it home - I noticed it had a bumpy ride, i called the dealer, they said all SUV's (RDX) have a bumpy ride.  A few days later, it rained terribly, the windshield wipers were bad, could not see out the windows.  

I happen to bring the car back for some minior detailing about a week and half after I purchased the vehicle, i complained about the ride and a squeek in the back of the car and the wipers.  When I told them about the wipers, they said they probably needed to be cleaned.  

I left the car for a few days, parts were not in... guess what, the Left Strut was bad... so much for a certified vehicle, This car should not have been sold with a bad strut.  BUYER BEWARE! Then, when i picked the car up, the service manager had the nerve to say to me, yes, we cleaned the wipers, and they were fine, but we decided to replace the wipers anyway!!! 

This give me little to no confidence in their 150 Point Certification check.I'm most likely going to another dealer to have th car looked at to ensure there is nothing else wrong with it. Granted, all at Acura were very nice to me, however I'd rather a rude mechanic that is going to ensure there is nothing wrong with my vehicle, over a smile and a coke, if you know what i mean.

Car purchased - 2007 RDX with 25K miles, Price Tag $27K.  They did repair the left strut, they had to, but this is something that should have never left the lot prior to being soled.  And, for this amount of money, they damn better give me new wipers.  The point of the story is, Struts are serious and damage to them can impact critical safety components of the car, traction and suspension.  If they do not check the basics out on a car or pay attention to the small things, no telling what else they overlooked!!",3.0
832,"June 01, 2009","Let me get the summary out of the way - this is the dealership (or at least the team) I would send everyone I know to.  After a long hunt, I was certain I wanted an Acura TL SH-AWD.  I'd had a phenomenally bad experience trying to work with Vandergriff (that's another review), so I sent out a ""feeler"" email through Edmunds which was immediately picked up by Brian Brown in Churchill's internet sales division.  He called within an hour of the start of business (I'd sent my email at 2am), gave me a great opening price, then listened to exactly what I wanted (I was very picky about the interior).  Brian called me just a day later to tell me he'd gotten my color, in my trim, both with AND without the sport tire package and offered to set me up for back to back test drives so I could decide whether to spend the extra money.  My work keeps me terribly busy, and I'd already wasted a week of test-driving and shopping before I found the Acura at all, so efficiency was at a premium.

I arrived at the dealership and Brian was waiting with two keys, and had even programmed my home address into the nav systems so I could see how they worked.  He was patient with my testing, and had the cars gassed up enough that we could keep them out for a little while to see how they handled on all sorts of roads.  While we were out on the test drives, he had a team of mechanics inspect my old car for trade-in value so we wouldn't have to wait.

Let me state this again, because you don't get to say it much in this business:  I was treated respectfully and fairly.  It took us almost no time after the test drives to agree on a fair value for my trade-in, and a great price on the car (I leased).  Brian moved all the paperwork with no ""shenanigans"" whatsoever, and while I was waiting for them to finish, I actually met Mac Churchill himself.  He promised me a smooth finish to the sale, and he wasn't just talking.  Even in the dreaded F&I office, their finance manager was everything I could have asked for.  He didn't sell me anything at all I didn't want or need (though they do have menu selling for new car purchases - feel free to decline *all* the packages if they don't fit your needs) and didn't give me even a bit of the anxiety that usually comes with a major purchase.  When I was done, my new car was sitting outside the doors.  They helped me link up my cellphone, program the XM radio stuff and sent me on my way, happy as a clam.

As always, do your homework, and ask Edmunds or some website like it how much that new car should cost before you even drive it, but if you're informed and respectful, I suspect you're going to see nothing but courtesy and professionalism from this team.  Would I recommend them?  Above all others in the area.",5.0
