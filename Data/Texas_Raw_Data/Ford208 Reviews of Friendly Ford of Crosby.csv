Listed a car online at $65K.  Changed the price to $71K when they sent the deal sheet over.

4,"February 19, 2020","My experience was negative with “Friendly” Ford. I don’t like the old school used car lot scams. In the internet age I find it surprising that they think their customers are uninformed. Basically they tried to pull a good old fashioned bait and switch. They had the Toyota FJ cruiser listed for $15000, they wouldn’t negotiate so I agreed to their price,$15000. I asked for the total price, TTL and $150 document fee. They sent it to me and it was $18071!
They had raised the price of the car from $15000 to $16196 then taxed that number. They had claimed the increase was from add-ons, which I didn’t request that totaled $1200. I asked them to remove them and they refused. What were the add ons? $299 to fill tires with nitrogen (free at costco), $199 wheel locks ($40 amazon), $499 vin window etching ($20 DIY kit on amazon) and $199 window replacement (insurance covers this). Don’t use this dealer unless you like getting ripped off.

5,"October 18, 2019","I tried to go in this morning for a works package.   They tried to tell me the works package is now 55 dollars and a tire rotation would be an extra 25.   The quicklane website says the works package is always 49.99 or less and includes a tire rotation.   

I have frequented this service department in the past, but will never bring any of my vehicles here again.   Completely wrong to charge a different price than the quicklane website.",1.0
6,"October 12, 2019","Called and spoke with internet salesman Jose Jasso about a truck I was interested in. I am from another state. After a brief conversation and pictures of said vehicle being sent to me I completed the necessary finance approval application per Jose's direction. I asked if I could put a hold on the truck. I was told no they couldn't do that however once financing is approved the vehicle is effectively held. I was happy with the price of the vehicle so no attempt was made for negotiations of its price. We negotiated the price of some outrageously priced add-ons that I did not want such as Nitrogen in the tires for $299. I was sent a worksheet of the total price and thought all was well as Jose texted me that the truck was mine and that we were all set for a weekend pickup. Later that day, after being sent the text that stated the truck was mine and that we were set for the weekend pickup, when I made contact again concerning the weekend pickup and my plans for transportation there and asking what forms and identification I needed to bring for financing and purchasing I got no response. A little while later I tried to call Jose and he sent a text response that I would be called shortly. I checked in again after a couple hours passed with no response to see when I could expect the promised call. Finally I was called by Jose, 3 1/2 hours later after my initial contact concerning transportation and ID needed, and he then told me someone else was buying the truck. I was told this new buyer contacted the dealership this same day, after my contact the previous day, after my financing approval the previous night, and after I was told the truck was mine by text this same day. I was told that this new buyer had somehow managed to complete financing approval and hold the truck. All this after I was told by text that the truck was mine. Wow! I contested this, explained that I was told that I could not hold the truck officially however financing approval does effectively hold the truck (which I completed the night before), and that I was ghosted for multiple hours that afternoon while apparently the truck was being sold to someone else. As you can imagine this conversation went nowhere. The truck was sold right out from underneath me. I have to wonder if it was done to make more profit on the extremely overpriced add-ons such as the $299 nitrogen? To make matters worse Jose said maybe the deal would fall through and he would update me the following day either way. Well, the next day came and went with no contact from Jose. Not a complete surprise based on how I was treated on the truck that I was told was mine. I myself reached back out to Jose, after not hearing from him as promised the previous day, and he confirmed the truck was sold. This was my poorest experience ever with a dealership. I feel this was very unethical and immoral. We clearly had a deal agreed upon, I was approved for financing, and Jose knew my plans of arriving over the weekend. He himself stated these things to me in text communication. Then somehow the truck is sold to someone else? ",1.2

9,"June 23, 2019","had  a Terrible experience at this dealership, i bought a f250 used about 3 weeks ago and the next day i realized it was full of ants, i called the salesman (José jasso) and the manager told me it was because ""the season"" i went twice because the first extermination didnt work, i missed a day of work, next time they told me they will do a full extermination which they did but i missed 7 days of work. I tried to return the truck but sales mánager told me that was the only way that they could help me. Its been stressful because ive had Nothing but problems with this truck. After that i went to the service 2 weeks later cause the truck was shaking and it had weird noises on the chasis,i picked Up my truck  sales man told me that was normal in those kinds of trucks, thats not true, everyone knows that. Ive had almost a month with the truck. i went to ntb to get my truck suspensión checked and they told me the stabilizer bar was damaged. Friendly ford didnt want to fix my truck cause i got the insurance and it was cover they said everything was ok. And till today i have the same problem with the ants. I regret buying this truck from this dealership and i do not want anyone to have these kinds of problems. Last thing, the same day i bought this truck, he tried to put a good coment on him self and the dealership with my own cell phone. The whole situation is unfair.",1.2

13,"February 15, 2019"," Call the dealer Monday, Feb. 11, 2019 to inquire about a recall on my car.  Gave the person who answered the phone the recall number and asked if they had the parts necessary to do the job.  She checked and said ""yes"" they had the parts in stock.  I asked how long it would take and she said 2-3 hours.  I told her I also needed a oil change and tire rotation, she said they could take care of it all.  I asked if it could be done today (2-11-19) and she said they were backed-up about 2 hours, but if I could bring it in around 1:00 or 2:00 they should be able to take it in.
I arrived at 1:30 pm and went to the front desk.  I might add that the service desk folks are anything but ""friendly"".  One man and one woman there and neither said as much has ""hi"".  I gave the lady the recall notice and she checked and said they did not have the parts.  They would have to be ordered, and when they got the parts in it would take 2 days to do the job.  I told her to throw that in the trash and asked if they could do a oil change and tire rotation today.  They only took 1 hour to do the oil change.

21,"January 18, 2019","I originally chose Friendly ford of Crosby because they have such a great selection of vehicles.  When i arrived there after work, the receptionist called for a sales Representative and there was no waiting. I am not one to drag out the process or what i want or expect.  Stanley Flores lead me to exactly what i wanted to look at and was able to quickly single out any vehicle that had the specifics i was looking for.
He actually listened to what my concerns were and what i wanted. Very professional and exceptionally knowledgeable.
After the purchase, i was ready to drive away and spend the next few days figuring out and reading about all the state of the art electronics that were included with my new vehicle.  However, we was not about to let me leave without going over everything.  Inside and out.  I was impressed at his technological know how.  Thanks so much for making me feel like an individual.",5.0

33,"October 30, 2018","I was searching internet and find the friendly dealership. They have all truck I am looking for and find one i love to. However, when I got there the F150 4X4 without running board is taller than I expect. I have to hold the handle to get in. I ask for 4x2, Andy help me looking all inventory and let me drive the 4x2 to park  along with 4x4. I feel like the 4x2 is still higher without running board. Andy help me  walk through whole park lot find one with running board and with the package I want. I thought I made deal with friendly dealership with  the 4x4. Because I change my mind to 4x2, they are going to manipulate the price. However Andy give me the price even better than internet. The final price all on their website. Thank you Andy and friendly dealership. Save me money and time.

35,"September 23, 2018","I have been looking at Ford trucks for over a year comparing prices against certain packages and every other comparison you can think of. This can, at times, be a bit confusing and very frustrating. When I saw a truck that I thought was the perfect truck for me it was located at Friendly Ford. I called them up and got Adher Hernandez who stated that they did indeed have the that truck and many more. The price for the truck with the package it had on it just seemed to cheap so I was skeptical and spent 3 days asking Mr. Hernandez questions, all of which he answered professionally and courteously and we set up a meeting. I could not have asked for a more pleasant salesperson and it was less then an hour before we shook hands and I took ownership of a new truck. Mr. Hernandez did exactly what he told me he could do, there were no catches, no discrepancies, not a bump in the road. It was the smoothest, quickest and most pleasant experience I've ever had purchasing a vehicle and the price was amazing. I would recommend this dealership and Adher Hernandez to anyone who is interested in getting a good deal on a new car or truck and also wanted a pleasant buying experience. I have purchased many vehicles in my life and I've never been more satisfied overall then I am with this purchase.",5.0

74,"August 20, 2017","We have bought several Ford trucks in the last 25 + years.   Most recently we had difficulties finding what wanted in Arizona where we reside.   We begin to search other locations and came across a truck we were interested in at Friendly Ford in Crosby, TX.   Chad Arch was the sales representative that contact us.    From the first interactions with Chad we were very impressed!  He was extremely helpful, knowledge about the vehicle and his response time was spot on.   He even assisted us in getting financing when our local credit union wouldn't finance a vehicle from an out of state dealership   He took the time to send us several pictures of the truck to ensure it was exactly what we wanted.   Our comfort level with Chad was the primary reason we made the trip from AZ to purchase the truck.  

Meeting Chad in person was equally impressive; he was professional yet friendly.   He ensured we were well taken care of and had the truck ready to go when we arrived.   Purchasing a truck from a dealership 1000 miles away was not our original plan, but in the end it worked out really well.    THANK YOU CHAD!  We'll be contacting you again for our next truck..... even from AZ!

Thank you!

It took me two trips to dealership and finally a phone call before a was even given a price.  After some negotiating we settled on price. I spoke with Sammy the finance director and informed him i just needed the paperwork to deliver to my bank. When I got there they would only honor the price if I did the financing through Ford or it would cost me 3000 more. I have never been lied to and disrespected so much from a dealership in my life.

146,"March 09, 2017","So my husband purchased a 2015 F250 about 2 years ago from this dealership. Last week we had a major engine problem happen and we took it to dealership to have  them replace the whole engine for us. I went to pick it up today and was sent to the pay window at the service department to pay our insurance deductible, I then asked the lady if she could show me the warranty information on the paperwork I was asked to sign (which my husband asked me to make sure paperwork had this information before I signed anything).  She asked me if I read the paper work.....I then reread it and again I saw nothing about warranty. She then told me I would have to speak to my service adviser about warranty who at that moment had  just walked up to me.I was then escorted to the back of the shop to speak to service manager who would not look at me and said there was no warranty after being told there was a warranty on a diesel engine.  I began to ask why there was no warranty I was told that he had already done me a favor by assisting me with the deductible (which was his idea to begin with before they started to work on truck).  He then turned around back to his computer to remove any assistance for deductible and said there was no warranty on the engine that Friendly Ford had just put in our $60,000 truck that we purchased from them.  I then left and decided I would let my husband deal with this manager and he obviously had no respect or even common business courtesy to speak with me. After walking away my service adviser came out to tell me she spoke to another manager who printed out the warranty information for me so I could go in and sign the paperwork to pick up vehicle. I then told her I would not deal with them and would have my husband talk to them and looked at me like I was crazy. The only person who had any real business savvy in handling our situation was Jenny. She was not our service adviser but she is the only one who helped us feel like we were doing the right thing by having them replace our engine and trust there competency .......the service manager treated me horribly, the lady at the money check out was rude and short and had not time for me. So after spending $60,000 on a truck and another $23,000 for repairs I was treated rudely, talk down to, was told one thing by one person than another by someone else, was made to feel like I was over reacting because I had many questions....over all just a horrible experience.

149,"February 13, 2017","Was shopping for a Ford Escape for my wife. Saw a good deal listed on their website for a 2017 Ford Escape with all the options we wanted.

Showed up at dealer and dealt with Tillman Walker. Test drove the vehicle liked it and proceeded inside to make a deal. 

Told the salesman we were pre-approved with our credit union for a certain amount which was a little less than the sales price. He came back with a figure way more than the internet sales price. Physically showed him the price listed on their website and was told it was a mistake and couldn't honor the price (Tillman is listed as a Internet Salesman on their website). The price hadn't been corrected for two weeks following our visit. 

He then told us they could do better incentives if financed through ford. We went through the whole shady dealer 4 square crap of tell us what you want for payments (While they make up for it with a trade in or crappy financing). All in all Tillman was nice and polite even if he didn't listen. 

They also undervalued my wife's trade-in by thousands. He had the nerve to tell us that KBB is not a reliable method of determining a trade-in value. That is kinda what blue book value is for. We ended up taking the trade in to Carmax and got a few hundred dollars better then KBB value.

We ended leaving after wasting more than FOUR hours of our time. Had they just said they couldn't meet our pricing request we would have walked out and not wasted our time. 

Later that week he called me and said he wanted to make a deal and would get me their best pricing. After waiting several hours I called back (was told it would take less than an hour). Their offer was still barely better than MSRP and not what their advertised pricing was.

Got called several weeks later right after I bought a new 2016 escape for what I was willing to pay. He said they would try to work something out on the price. I'm sorry but if you want to make a deal just give people a good offer and honor your advertised pricing. You could have saved us and yourself a lot of wasted time.

I would not send my worst enemy to this dealer to buy anything. They don't honor internet pricing, practice shady sales techniques, have dealer add on fees for crap nobody needs, and will just plain waste your time.

We witnessed another couple at the same time heated arguing with another salesman about misleading advertising after the finance guy told them he wouldn't honor their pricing.",1.4

160,"September 13, 2016","Probably the worst dealership I ever dealt with. I'm not new to car buying. Took 17 phone calls to get the answers I needed about the car. Simple ones on a used car -- like what is the warranty? Drive from Dallas to Houston (5 hour drive) and I had filled out the credit application 5 days prior. Should have been a walk in, sign the paperwork and be on the road. Oh and we put 70% down. The finance manager left my son waiting for over 3 hours. Only have one finance manager and you’re near Houston? Unheard of.

I am in the customer service business. At a minimum they should have sent them out to dinner while they waited.  Or put them up in a hotel room. Instead, they left out of towners to sit for 3 hours JUST for the financing with good credit. No respect.

And the real insult? After all of that they sent him on his way with a ¼ tank. Not the way to do business.

169,"February 27, 2016","Please do yourself a favor and Do NOT use this dealership! First let me say, I LIVE in Crosby, I wanted to use this dealership, give them my business and support my community... this is how I was treated as a result:
 
I went in to purchase a truck at 9:30 AM - I had the truck picked out from the net before I even got there. I test drove it and and then entered into negotiations to purchase the vehicle. Some other people came into the dealer at about 11 AM and I saw them looking at the truck because it was parked right out front where I left it after the test drive - The salesman I was working with said someone else might be interested in it but not to worry since I had already agreed to purchase it, I thought he was probably using some lame sales game to build urgency so I thought nothing of it. After some back and forth negotiations we came to an agreement which I SIGNED, the salesman said the finance guy had to do all the paperwork and it would take some time so why didn't I go grab something to eat and come back in about an hour. I ran next door to get a coffee and when I returned 20 minutes later the salesman pulled me aside and said they were selling the truck to SOMEONE ELSE!  WHAT?? He said he was very upset about it also - apparently the other sales guy had more seniority. I was so upset, I asked for the sales manager, who after making me wait for 30 more minutes finally came out only to flippantly say ""Sorry, these things happen sometimes."" No explanation, no offer to make it right, nothing. He didn't even offer to show me anything else... When I pressed him for an explanation he made up some lame excuse and mumbled ""maybe the other person had been in a 'few days earlier' but did not buy at that time and had come back?"" (I saw them come in, AFTER I had agreed to buy the truck) He shrugged and walked off. I was furious! How can they stay in business treating customers that way? I am a long time Ford Customer and have good credit. I had not come in to browse or try to get credit approval - I had come in to purchase.

In the end they did me a HUGE favor! I went over to Baytown Ford, (15 minutes away) dealt directly with the sales manager Tommy and purchased a much better truck, with more options and a MSRP that was much higher  for less money than the truck I was was going to buy from Friendly Ford. I also was offered more for my trade-in! Seriously.(At the time I did not realize that I was getting SO overcharged. I feel really bad for the people who DID buy that truck because I'm sure that the money grubbing dealership charged them even MORE than they were going to charge me, after all, If I had been offering more who do you think they would have sold the truck to?? Honestly?) The transaction at Baytown Ford was smooth and took less than 3 hours, no BS - no haggling, just a good deal .  I was financed through Ford Credit for 1.9% financing. Save yourself the aggravation and go directly to Baytown Ford or some other dealer... Please.",1.0
170,"January 19, 2016","The folks at this dealership made this such a great car buying experience.  I live in Houston and made the trip out to Crosby to purchase a new vehicle.  When I got there, I was introduced to BT.  He was friendly, excited, and genuinely interested in helping me find the best car for me and my pups (because room for my dogs was a big part of what I was looking for in a car).  After getting to know a little bit about me and my driving habits, BT helped me pick out the perfect car.  I highly recommend making the trip out to Crosby and asking for BT -- or anyone there for that matter!

189,"August 28, 2014",So bought two vehicles from here in the past 12 months and the expedition i noticed service quality had deteriated from past 2 vehicles i purchased from them. I sent my wife to purchase expedition while i was at work and setting price over the phone and after talking her into a few terms that wasn't in the agreement the service after the sale was complete has been even worse. The mustang experience has been even worse flat out lied to by salesman and sales manager and we owe items still not done but was told pretty much scratch deal or live with it after two trips there wasting my time after being told over phone it was complete just to arrive and see it clearly wasn't. The new attitude here from what i can tell is tell the customer what they want to hear and make empty promises to make the sale then screw them after papers are signed. Left review on their site and contact info for dealership owner and have not heard from anyone.  12th vehicle purchase. Fourth over 15yr time period and absolutely the worse. I also have emails and documents from signing backing up every lie i was told from employees. ,1.8
190,"July 24, 2014","We have purchased THREE vehicles from Friendly Ford within SIX years.  We try to remain loyal customers and establish a good relationship with our local, small dealership.  We upgraded with every purchase (by tens of thousands of dollars).  Well, our last purchase was basically a lemon.  Granted, the problems with the truck are not the fault of the dealership, but you would think they would want to make it right for a LOYAL, LOCAL customer.  We wanted to give the dealership the opportunity to resolve the issue (friendly customer service, right?) before proceeding with any lemon law complaints.  They said ""come in and we will work out a trade.""  Well, it was the same old song and dance, as with any trade.  We were offered $10K less than what we purchased the truck for five months ago, which is $7K under NADA value.  We even considered upgrading again, which would have been MORE money in THEIR pocket.  I'm not asking for a free ride, I'm just asking for what I paid for.  If you spend $50K on a vehicle, it should operate flawlessly, or warranties should easily fix any problems.  Unfortunately, my truck's problems are pretty much beyond repair, and I just want the new truck I bought to operate like a new truck should.  If/when management reads this, they will know which customer they are dealing with.  I will be reviewing this dealership in every place possible to share my experience with other existing and potential customers.",1.0
191,"June 25, 2014","I went in thinking I couldn't really get what I wanted (an Edge) and would settle for an (Escape) - Tillman my sales person let me look at all the inventory and helped me find an Edge that I could be comfortable affording.  Having looked online for over six months - the price was very fair for a gently used Edge - I didn't even haggle as I felt that it was that fair.

I had already gotten pre-approved financing before coming, but Tillman suggested that I let them see what they could find for me - that saved me over 1% and I got an excellent finance rate with the help of Humberto the Finance Director - I almost got a new car interest rate on a used vehicle.

I hate car shopping - they made this experience painless and quick - I'm feel like I was fairly dealt with, got a fair deal and am very happy.  I highly recommend Friendly Ford in Crosby - they're worth the drive.",5.0

After working with Tillman Walker and Austin Salinas to get down to a sales number on a truck I wanted they were actually out bid by another dealer...Baytown Ford. After attempting to purchase the better priced truck at Baytown Ford (which was an awful experience) I walked out of the door at the Baytown dealership and drove straight to Crosby to purchase the higher priced truck. After such a terrible experience at Baytown Ford I didn't care how expensive the other truck was at Crosby, I knew I would be treated the way a customer should. After arriving at Crosby directly after the Baytown experience, Tillman never asked questions and immediately offered the previously discussed truck at the price we had agreed upon earlier. Within 5 min. Tillman had started the paperwork to put me in my new vehicle. During the paperwork process the sales manager (Austin Salinas) notified me they had actually found more rebates for my truck and had lowered the price of my new truck by another $1,500!

He was backing out of that agreement and wanted it a couple days later or he said he was going to repo our vehicle. Mind you our first car payment wasn't even due yet. He also called a reference of ours and shared our personal information with them. When we went in to make a partial payment we gave the money to the cashier and got our reciept, later that day he called asking if we made a payment and when we said yes we have the reciept he started being very rude and telling us that we were being sneaky that we didn't come to him. He didn't sell us the car, he is not the person we pay, we shouldn't have to see him. He is extremely rude and harrassing and went as far as hanging up on us. We were going to go and buy another vehicle for us so that we can have 2 cars after this one was paid off, but now we will be going to a different dealership because no one should be treated this way especially when our first car payment isn't even due yet and we still haven't recieved our tags.

They checked out and found the thermostat was stuck open. I said to replace it and they came back to me and said they did not have in stock and it was already late in the morning and they said they can get one down the street at the auto parts, and I told them I did not want an aftermarket thermostat, I had trouble in the past from aftermarket crap. The service advisor assured me it would be a good part so I consented on his word on the thermostat. They installed aftermarket thermostat and finished my vehicle. On my way home and I live in Jacinto City by the way. The vehicle started overheating and got it home. Call Friendly ford and they said bring it back, so I did. They checked it and said the system probably had air in system so they took it to the service area and checked and road tested, told me it was ok. I took vehicle home and the temp gauge kept fluxuating between normal and hot and was not right to me. Also when I got home and checked under the hood I found they broke my hood prop rod holder and broke some hood clips as well. I had to go buy these parts and install myself. They broke the parts and never said anything about it. So I took my explorer to my mechanic friend who I knew for years. He checked out the vehicle and found the thermostat was defective, no good. So I went to Champion ford by my job and bought the motorcraft thermostat and my friend installed it and had no more problems. I talked to Damon and wanted a refund on the parts and labor on the thermostat, which was around $150.00 and he refused. Said I did not deserve the refund because I did not bring back to them. After the experience I just had with them , there was no way I would take my vehicle back there. I got with the general manager there and he called me with Damon on a conference call with me.
