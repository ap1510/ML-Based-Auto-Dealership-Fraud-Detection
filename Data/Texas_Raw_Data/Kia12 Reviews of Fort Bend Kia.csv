0,"January 21, 2020","I went to this dealership not expecting much. I was treated very poorly at another Honda Dealership in Houston and it turned me off from buying a car from a dealership. I went as far as purchasing a car through the ""Big Three Online Car Dealerships"" and overpaid. But I am so glad I tried again in person at Fort Bend Kia. I worked with Dave (Sales) and Gaston (Finance) and was able to meet Jeff (Manager). All three were genuinely friendly and made this experience memorable. 

I worked with Dave over the phone and email and he confirmed details and was able to provide me a fair price for a vehicle I was interested in. He made sure that I was able to come by and check out the car, get a test drive, and got temporary plates done. He was very kind, patient with my needs, and kind and courteous at all times. 

I was a little apprehensive to meet with Gaston for the financing portion. He was very understanding of my financial situation, needs, and did not pressure me to get anything that he did not think was appropriate for my driving needs. He was also kind and patient and did not rush me into signing all of my contracts without me reading through it and letting me take my time. 

I would highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a place to buy a car. Everyone here was kind and courteous. Hopefully this review will help those apprehensive to go to a car dealership who have had negative experiences elsewhere. ",5.0
1,"December 07, 2019","Liars 
The sales manager is horrible! Do not trust the them! They agreed to the sell of a car and we were told they ordered the part to fix the camera then we we would pick it up the next day. When I contacted to arrange our pick up time they said they sold the car after we left! I saw they listed itâ€™s for $1000 more on the website after we left. An agreement is not honored at this location. I called the GM to see what happened to our agreement and he was told lies by his sales manager. I sent over my text and phone log proving my agreement. DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THESE LIARS! Horrible customer service ",1.0
2,"July 26, 2019","I made an appointment to drive a used car. When I arrived at the dealership I waited approximately 20 minutes for them to locate the keys. After waiting I was informed that the car had been sold. At that time they attempted to show me other, more expensive vehicles. I understand that they are in the business of selling cars; however, to sell the exact car I am en route to drive and then attempt to sell me a more expensive vehicle is unethical.",1.0
3,"December 14, 2016","Jay Rajput of Fortbend Kia was the only salesman (of six salesman at four differnt Kia dealerships) who was able to identify the Optima package that met my list of requested features within my price range.

He was persistent when the others said I was asking the impossible.

I really appreciate his ability to research, listen, and think outside the box. He answered all my questions and made sure all my car's technology options were set up to my preference before I left the dealership.

His no pressure tactics,  big smile, and friendly personality made my hunt for the perfect car easier.

Trouble finding what you...see Jay Rajput at Fortbend Kia.",5.0
4,"October 12, 2016","I dealt with this dealership and my salesperson over the phone for weeks before I was able to come in and purchased my new KIA Soul! Last week.  My salesperson, Arseniy, is the nicest and most courteous sales associate at a car dealership I have ever met.  He showed me what I was interested in seeing and did not pressure me, which is what I requested from the beginning.  He made it a completely enjoyable car shopping experience!  I came in the dealership at 11:30 AM and had concluded the sale and left by 4:00 PM.  Those of you who have purchased cars know this is a great time frame to discuss, test drive, negotiate, and do paperwork for a financed vehicle.  Our finance person, Maranda, was very personable and helpful; she did appear somewhat 'cooler' toward us once I declined all the add-on warranties/coverages, leading me to wonder if finance people might get an incentive for up selling.  Overall she was wonderful, however. 

My only disappointment in the entire process was their response to my having disability plates.  They told me they could not help me with that - I would have to wait until my permanent plates came into the dealership, then take those plates to the DMV and trade them out for NEW disability plates.  They said I cannot keep my current plates.  Needless to say, I called the DMV yesterday morning to find out what I need to do and they were surprised the dealership would/could not help me with this; they said most dealerships take care of it for disabled customers.  All that needs to be done is calling the DMV to check when the new car is in their system, and then paying a small fee to have my current plates transferred to my new vehicle.  So, again, that was the only negative thing about the entire experience.

I would recommend this dealership - it's small and they have time to tend to your purchasing needs.  I HIGHLY recommend Arseniy as your sales person!!!",4.8

11,"March 07, 2012","WE had a great experiance, from the moment we arrived we were told that it would be a little bit of a wait, but it was'nt. We were paired with Nabeel and told He would take very good care of us. (And they were right)We were a little discouraged when we asked Nabeel for specific qualities in a Sorento and he said that they did not have it. He reinsured us that we were still in the right place. He took us for a test drive in a Metalic Green Sorento and Brian and I fell in LOVE. This car was almost the opposite of what we asked for and yet we were sooooo happy. Needless to say we left with a 2012 Green Metalic Kia Sorrento and we have'nt been Happier. Thank you so much for all you have done.
