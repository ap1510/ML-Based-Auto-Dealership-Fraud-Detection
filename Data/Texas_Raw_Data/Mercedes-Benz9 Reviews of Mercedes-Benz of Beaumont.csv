0,"February 27, 2020","I can't say enough about this Dealership, Very low pressure, they are willing to work with you. I wish all dealerships were like this one. Sales Lady Mija House made you feel like family. Sales Mgr Oliver Lacy made sure I was happy with the price  and did an exceptional job. Jeff Bailey with Finance made sure I got all the incentives offered. I recommend that before going to Houston try this dealership first you'll be glad you did. They will definitely Get my business again.
Respectfully,

2,"January 06, 2018",Took my Bentz to this dealership for schedule A service today and Safety recall. Had requested a loaner at time of booking. None available. Drive 50 miles for this service and was told I would have to wait on it 2-2.5 hours in waiting room. Walked out!!!!  They were overbooked and only 3 service techs there!!!  Second time I have had trouble with this dealership. I will NOT be going back there!!!  They need to get lessons from Lafayette or McKinney dealership. These two are professional and quality work!!,1.0
3,"November 06, 2017","Mike Smith Mercedes in Beaumont has tha absolute worst service dept AND employees! I scheduled my annual A service with an appt.  Walk in and my existence isnt even acknowledged! So I stand there awkwardly for 5 min and no one even looked up.  And no, they were not all with customers. I proceed into the showroom looking for anyone that can help. I find 1 salesman playing on his phone, and he doesnt even notice me until I start looking at a car on the showroom floor.  I explain my dilemma .. I've now been there 10 min ... he walks me back to the service area and even with him, we are completely ignored! I FINALLY get help and progress is made... its now 10:52 and I'm told everyone is going to lunch so it will be at least an hour before they start on my car. I told the girl i also needed the liftgate  looked at because it isn't working properly, that I want 4 new tires and to please do a State inspection.  I take off at almost 11 am in the loaner.  I get a call at 1:30 telling me the inspection cannot be done because my tires failed!!  Really!?  Perhaps that is why i told you I want 4 new tires put on. Ugh!  So now, my car won't be ready at 3 pm, which is when I informed her I needed it by. I live 50 miles away from Beaumont.   So, I took the loaner home. And, yay me, I get to go back to Beaumont the next day.  So ... i pick my car up, and she informs me the part for the liftgate will take at least a week to come in, and she will call me so I can go back yet again! 2 weeks later i get a call ... ""how is your car performing, blah blah blah ... ok give us a call if you need anythibg"".  I'm like, wait a minute, what about the part for my liftgate ... has it come in?  Uuummmm, we already fixed that, while your car was here.  Shocked, I ask, then why did you tell me it had to be ordered??  Of course, she couldn't explain that.  Ugh ... so at least i don't have to go back again, right?? WRONG!  3 weeks after all that crap, my message center informs me i need to check brake pad wear!!!!!!!  Needless to say, i am furious as this item is checked off on my service report as passing !!  I called yesterday afternoon to speak to the GM, and of course he didn't answer. I left a message. Its been roughly 24 hours and no call back!!  I love my ML 350 blutech ... but an Infinity is looking like a good trade option. They will come pick your car up from your home and leave you a loaner to perform all annual service!  Mike Smith Mercedes is the worst ever dealership!  BuyerS BEWARE",1.6
4,"April 02, 2017","Towed my E 350 on Jan 12 for a relatively simple problem.  It wouldn't start and the steering wheel locked.  
Department would not return calls for several days.  After 6 days I was able to talk to someone finally.   They had not even started to diagnose my car.   They start working on it only after I talked to the manager.     Like it is very common they called back with a very large list of things they suggested changing.  I approved only the routine service and the fixing of the problem.   Bill:  $1600, 70% on labor cost.   They took 4-6 hours to work on it after I told them that I would be there to pick it up ready or not.
I got my car back on Jan 25!! and only because I told them I was going to tow it to another facility.   The repair cost probably 125% more than if done in a generic garage.  I expect to pay more for mercedes service but I also I expect superior service.   Very disappointed and annoyed.     
They sent me a box of chocolates 1 week later.

Summary:   
                        13 days to return me my car.
                         7 days to start the diagnosis
                         12 days to start to work on it
                         1 hour for diagnosis,   approximately 5 hours of labor.
                         Overpriced labor (expected)
                          Absolutely horrible communication
                         A box of 4 chocolates (good quality) with a generic note 1 week later.

My advice:  If you are going to use them for service make sure you get a loaner.  All other times I did.  This time I didn't because It was towed there and I live far away.  I don't think it is a coincidence that when I get a loaner they work my car on time.",2.2

6,"August 24, 2016","My salesman, Rick, was very easy to work with. Was able to purchase locally. Was not happy with the condition of the console and they ordered a new one. So far, very pleased!",5.0
7,"June 02, 2016","Thanks to Deborah Dommert for her kindness, help and knowledge when we decided to buy our first Mercedes - Benz she made test driving numerous vehicles easy and answered our questions with great knowledge. We also found the staff to be very friendly. ",5.0
8,"March 27, 2011","    I bought an apparance warranty for  $2200.00 Later I decided it was usless, small print on contract rendered it usless. Car was bought in April. In January I met with Cris Jenkins and cancled this policy. He stated that I had $1800.00 coming.   Today is March 27, and Cris will not take my calls. He had said it would take 4-6 weeks. I am still waiting. Mike Smith likes to take advantage of old people. I am going to small claims court.     David Humphrey",3.2
