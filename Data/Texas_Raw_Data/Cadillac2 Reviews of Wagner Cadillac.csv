0,"September 27, 2019","I ended up buying a vehicle from this instead of a local dealership because I liked working with Misti so well. She's very personable and friendly... Someone you could just talk to about anything, really. The delivery guys who delivered my car down to Houston were very nice, and Misti added a little personal touch for my wife as well. I also talked to the finance guy, and he was nice, also. ",4.5
1,"November 09, 2017","Took my 07 SRX in for a few services. They didn't replace fender well cover after replacing blinker bulb and left rear cover unsecured. They left a black shoe print on carpet. They didn't tighten lug nuts properly after tire rotation and I was missing a lug when I got home. They cracked some of the plastic off front bumper. They charged me twice for labor and parts and gave no explanation. They charged me for 2 engine air filters instead of 1. They didn't give me the discounts/s I was entitled to. They charged me for 2 services plus labor for something that is actually 1 service. They offered to come get my car and have it detailed and fix what they did but I declined because of the way my vehicle was initially treated. I filed a complaint with the BBB and their attitude abruptly changed! They lied to the BBB, accused me of lying about damages, etc and now insist they didn't do anything wrong! ",1.0
