12,"May 25, 2019",We drove 3 hours to see a car and had several conversations before we arrived. There was items on the car that were not discovered until we arrived. We spoke with Casey the sales manager for the lot we were on. He and all of his salesmen sprung into action. They swapped three screens until it was perfect!  We also had some confusion on the price but Casey agreed to honor what we had viewed on the internet. Everything we had concerns with they would   stop  everything and fix it. Financing and paperwork were also super easy! We will be back to buy our next car from them!,4.8

16,"November 26, 2018","I have bought numerous cars/SUVS from Orr Chevrolet over the years. We had bought a 2018 Traverse back in July. Late September my daughter was driving it and had a wreck with someone that ran a stop sign. While waiting & waiting for their insurance to contact us about a rental, I contacted ORR to see if they rent vehicles. They said YES, Come on over! We did & they handed us a key to a Traverse that they would bill the other insurance for. Once we settled on the totaled Traverse, they found us a New Traverse that was exactly what we wanted. Mike Anderson & Joel Orr are both awesome to work with and take great care of us. I will only purchase from ORR CHEVROLET!",5.0
17,"November 06, 2018"," I took our 2016 Chevy 2500HD, which was still under the original manufacturer warranty, to Orr Automotive Chevy dealership in Texarkana TX. The truck was having an issue with the steering. I was dealing with Kelli Calvit in the service department. After waiting 20 minutes to find out what the issue was, Kelli came to the waiting room. She told me that whatever the issue is they cannot look at it because the torsion bars have been adjusted when a level kit was installed. I told her we never installed or had installed a level kit and we were the only owners. She said there was definitely a level kit installed. She tells me that an alignment might or might not fix the problem. I was extremely confused but told her to go ahead and do the alignment. While waiting for them to do the alignment, I called the dealership where we purchased our truck from to find out why there was a level kit installed on a brand new truck. They said that he would check on it and call me back. In the meantime, I told Kelli to hold off on the alignment. She told me that she could not because they already started. It had only been a few minutes. I explained that I wanted to talk to the dealership we purchased it from before putting any money into the truck that might not even be the issue. She tells me that if the other dealership is at fault that they will pay for the alignment. I told her that did not make sense because an alignment is considered maintenance so there is no reason for them to cover that cost. She  agreed but told me that she cannot stop the alignment from getting done. I got a call from the other dealership a few minutes later. He said he had the paperwork in front of him and there was no level kit installed on the truck. I was so confused but I paid for the alignment and left. I got about 5 miles down the road and realized that the alignment did not help. In fact, the steering wheel was now not aligned with the tires and the steering seemed worse. My husband called Kelli back to tell her that he wanted them to make it right. She told him that they will not touch the truck because of the torsion bars being adjusted. She told him that she also would not refund our money. 
My husband knew that Kelli had no idea what she was talking about and wanted a second opinion. He called Coleman Automotive in New Boston TX. He spoke with Ralph. We made an appointment for Monday. This required an extra day off and about 50 miles roundtrip. After inspecting the truck, they informed me that there is no level kit and that nobody has adjusted the torsion bars. He said that the alignment was also off and that is what was causing the issue with the steering. He could not find any other issues. I left and the alignment done on this day seems to have fixed the issue.
The receipt/invoice that shows the work done by Orr Automotive also shows our truck as having over 49,000 miles. It had just over 33,000 miles when we took it in. 
We should never had to of taken our truck to another dealership to resolve a simple issue. We shouldn't have had to pay for two alignments. I do not understand how this dealership can make up such lies and still be in business. ",1.0

19,"July 11, 2018","My salesman, Lee Lybarger , was a great help to buy a car! He was very helpful in what I was looking for and knowledgeable about the car I was buying!. He and Mgr. David Yarberry , made the process of negotiations for buying a car very easy . If I had any questions, they would text me in a very short time or with a phone car!! Service is what sells and that is exactly what you will get from these two salesmen. I was not going to trade my vehicle in,  I almost always get more when I sell it, but I got a very good  quote and I took it!!  I am very pleased with my experience at Orr and would recommend  them  to all my friends! A very stressless experience !!",5.0

36,"March 01, 2016","Car fax was clean, but I had a problem with car and found out it was wrecked. Dealership refused to fix car at first & finally repaired it after chewing them out. It was returned in worse shape than when I left it. Took them 3 weeks to screw something in. I would not buy a car from this dealership at all.

37,"May 29, 2014","I went to the Pre owned superstore to purchase a used vehicle. I was very pleased at the selection of different vehicles they had. I was also very surprised about how nice and friendly the employees were. I was given the upmost respect. I was also very glad that i didnt get the run around. I test drove a few cars and fell in love with a pt cruiser. This car plenty of room for me and my children, When i talked to the salesman and the finance they were easy to deal with and got me a perfect rate that suited me. I was able to put a reasonable down payment down and have a very good monthly payment a month. I would definatly refer friends, family, or anyone for that matter to come deal with ORR Chevrolet",4.6
38,"September 21, 2012",This dealer flat out lied about the buy back guarantee on the extended warranty they sold me if i didn't use it by the end of the warranty. Basically screwed me out of 1500.00 dollars. I will never buy from this dealer again nor do I recommend this dealer to anyone. ,1.4
