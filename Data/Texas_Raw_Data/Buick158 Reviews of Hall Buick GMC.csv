17,"March 31, 2018","I was in the market for a 2500 HD diesel, and found a 2016 model with extremely low miles at Hall Buick/GMC. I began working with Jose Cervantes. It was a long distance negotiation (I was 235 miles south of Tyler), and Jose was very patient and accommodating with my many questions about the truck. We also worked out my trade in value over the phone, and using photos e-mailed and texts.

It took about ten days to finalize the deal, and Jose remained focused, working patiently with me to ensure I was getting what I wanted out of this deal. I drove the four hours yesterday to get the truck, and in spite of a several block-wide power outage as soon as I arrived, they made it happen. Jose had prepped everything the day before, even sending me a photo of the temporary plate to add to my EZTag account. Gus Sanchez took care of the paperwork old school, since the computers and copiers were affected by the outage.

Since we had pre-coordinated everything up front, I don't think I was there for more than 45 minutes before I was driving away in the best truck I have ever owned. The return trip was fabulous, and this truck is awesome, and great looking to boot!

I can't say enough how pleased I was with the whole experience. Jose was the utmost professional, never pressuring me once, just making sure I was happy with the deal I was getting. I would highly recommend anyone use Hall Buick/GMC, and when you do, ask for Jose! ",5.0
18,"March 20, 2018","Leo was great! I was initially impressed by how well he explained the features of the used car we eventually bought even though it was from a different manufacturer.

20,"March 13, 2018","In spite of me getting a bit antsy waiting on papers to be ready to sign, Leo was there for me.

34,"November 25, 2017","My daughter had to have a new vehicle. We were referred to Leo Flores at Hall Buick GMC in Tyler. We didn't make an appointment and when we arrived, Leo was with another customer. Instead of making us just wait around, Leo asked another salesman to show us vehicles and answer any questions that we had. I do not remember this salesman's name, but he was very patient and polite. When Leo was free to help us, the salesman thanked us for choosing Hall and told us that since we came to see Leo, he was going to let Leo take over. I appreciate the professional courtesy that they had for each other while making sure my family's needs were met. The paperwork was done quickly and Leo helped my daughter get her My Buick app and OnStar account set up before we left the dealership.

35,"November 22, 2017","I am tasked with assisting my family find used cars to purchase and have dealt with a ton of used car sales people. My experience here was by far the best. Sandy was great - professional, polite, and prompt. She didnâ€™t try to oversell and didnâ€™t use any common tactics associated with the stereotypical used car sales person. The other thing that is rare is how they make you feel that they really do care and want to earn your business-not because the vehicle is great but because they want to help you get what you want and walk away without buyers remorse. It was a true honor to work with Sandy and her team - I will drive 2 hours again just to work with them because putting customers first means more to me than high pressure sales tricks and I want to go where I know I am valued.",5.0

37,"November 06, 2017","I, like most folks, do NOT like the prospect of buying a new vehicle for a bunch of reasons. Spending more money to get what you want, being treated in an agressive manner by sales people, a sales person who gives you an answer even if it's the wrong one just to say something, the tremendous amount of time it seems to take are among the top few. I got none of these dealing with Taylor Willa at Hall Buick GMC. In fact I got a great deal, an humble approach, honest responses, and a quick I'm and out transaction.

98,"September 21, 2017","After working for a dealership years ago, buying a vehicle has always been something I ""dreaded"". Just the thought of having to deal with a sales person, finance manager, etc. was enough to delay my buying for several months. Then I found Hall Buick GMC. 
From the first email concerning a Denali I was interested in, to driving off with my Lincoln MKC, my experience was above and beyond what I have ever experienced and I would encourage you to stop by and give Hall a try!! 
But, beyond the Sales Team (James Bragg is great!) and Finance Department, let me talk about the salesman I was privileged to have! SEAN absolutely made me fell like family and when I wasn't ""crazy"" about the Denali I drove home for the night to try, he showed me the Lincoln and never ONCE did I feel like I was wasting his time, nor did I feel like he wasn't happy that he couldn't sell me the Denali. That says something about the type of man Sean is! I am sure there are other wonderful, caring, compassionate people you could deal with at Hall, but... I would RECOMMEND you ask for SEAN!!! You will NOT be disappointed!

I came in to purchase a new mid-size mid-grade GMC Canyon.

 I was in Tyler to visit my family for Mothers Day celebration.  Hall Buick was suggested to me by a family member due to their superior reputation.
 From the moment Sean greeted me, I knew I had found the person I wanted to do business with.  He listened to the things that mattered most to me in a new car.  His goal was to help me find exactly what I wanted , NOT  to pressure me into a vehicle he could ""sell"" me.

150,"April 24, 2016","I have always driven Ford trucks. My wife has always driven Tahoes and Suburbans. I typically trade every year and my wife every two years. Needless to say, we've made a lot of vehicle transactions over the years and in doing so I have developed a great relationship with the Ford and Chevrolet dealerships in Longview (we live in Longview). It was time to get my wife out of her 2015 Tahoe and in to something new. Needing another full size SUV (we have 3 kids), I was particularly interested in the Yukon Denali for the 6.2L and 8 speed tranny powertrain. You can't get the 6.2L / 8 speed in a Tahoe. I was dreading having to deal with a new (to us) dealership. So much so that I was almost willing to settle for another Tahoe as I knew I would be faced with dealing with the typical dealership BS. We found a Denali we liked online and it happened to be at Hall. I made the call and asked to speak with someone in sales, it must have been my lucky day as I got connected with Sean McSpedden. Sean and I talked on the phone for a few minutes and he answered all of my questions. What a pleasant suprise. Half of the time when I deal with dealerships, I know more about the vehicle than the sales person. Not the case with Sean. He knows his product inside and out. He made an excellent first impression and I scheduled an appointment to come in and test drive the Denali. Even though our conversation and discussion was great and I felt comfortable talking on the phone with him, I still anticipated the typical dealership games the next day. I did a Google search for his name online that night, I wanted to know who my adversary was going to be the next day. I still dreaded coming in and spending an afternoon at the dealership playing games. Sean had positive reviews online which put me at ease a bit. The next day I met Sean at the dealership. We went on a test drive. This wasn't your typical around the block test drive as with most dealerships. He allowed me ample time and driving situations, highway / town etc., to put the vehicle through it's paces. He even offered to let me have it for the afternoon on my own. I was sold on the Denali, now comes the dreaded part... The Deal. There was no pressure, no BS. Integrity and honesty, that's what I got from everyone I dealt with there. Rey, Eric and Sean. All three of these guys were straight up no BS guys. From negotiating the trade, to doing a wheel swap and putting financing in place. It was all a pleasant experience. I felt like Sean was working for me throughout the process not the dealer. We got the deal done and I was satisfied. Came in the next day to pick up the Denali... Talk about red carpet service. It was pulled up front, detailed and ready to go. No waiting around, everything in place just like I asked. Sean spent plenty of time getting all the features setup and going over everything with me. He even offered to pickup the vehicle Monday to get the windows tinted. That's right, Sean offered to pickup the vehicle, take it to get the windows tinted and deliver it back. That's service, where to you find that these days??? I get GM supplier pricing through my employer, so I wasn't expecting exceptional service, but I got it. Long story short, I'm sure Hall is a great place to do business no matter who you're dealing with. Everyone I dealt with was exceptional. But, I can guarantee you that with Sean as your sales person you will no doubt have a trouble free, no BS, no games car buying experience. What an excellent guy. I had such an excellent experience I will probably try a Denali HD for my next truck over a Ford... And trust me, that's saying a lot.",5.0

Then we met with Gus Sanchez to go over the paperwork. He explained the process in detail to make sure I understood the services offered and made sure I got the best deal. paperwork is never fun, but he made it as painless as possible.

I have heard all of the ins and outs of all of the car dealers in Tyler, whether they are above board or a little suspicious in their dealings. I have seen many come and go. I have always heard good, positive things about Hall Buick GMC. Upon my mother in-law looking for a vehicle after the passing of my father in law, we stepped on to the sales lot of Hall and started looking. salesman Sean McSpeeden was walking the lot removing keys from vehicles and stopped to visit with us casually. As we dicussed what we were looking for and who for he pointed us in the direction of a 2013 Chevy Captiva, My mother in law test drove it and decided to pass on it, (we not knowing she wanted a Ford), she didn't tell us until she bought a vehicle in another town. But we were impressed with the Captiva and my wife and I decided to go back to Hall and talk to Sean about the Captiva for our own use. Knowing all the time Sean is aware of our interest, we purchased the Captiva. Now two years later we kept Sean in mind for my next vehicle. we recently purchased a 2009 Chevrolet Silverado thru Sean and knowing we did not want to make the deal with anybody else. Sean and I were always letting each other know where we stood on making purchases and I did not at any time feel a hard sell coming thru Sean. I will continue to recommend Sean if my friends for co-workers ask, and go back to him if I am in need of a vehicle and see what he has to offer. The owners and management have been very much dedicated tio prividing for our needs and supporting the community in many endevors.  Kudos to Hall Buick GMC for its dedication to providing GREAT customer service.

During the sale, my wife was walking around looking at the showroom and the lot just to kill time (though the whole process was rather quick) and she came back talking about a car.  The payments on her (then) current car were very low and this was a brand new Buick she was looking at.  Long story short, we left there with two new vehicles, both with lower payments and lower insurance premiums.  It was a no-brainer and a decision that has proved itself since that day.

We have purchased our last 3 vehicles from Hall Buick, GMC.  We have dealt with the same sales person each time, Sean McSpedden.  Sean along with all staff respect you as a person and most importantly respect your time.  All 3 deals have pretty much been made over the phone, with little to no hassle,  which makes going in the same day or next business day ( yes I have bothered him on Saturday's after hours about a vehicle-lol ) signing the papers and driving out in your new car a stress free buying experience. Sean is very patient and takes the time to go over all the features of the new vehicle to make sure you know how to operate everything before leaving the lot.  If I ever have a question or concern, I know he is only a phone call or text away. You don't get that kind of customer service at just any dealership.  The service department at Hall Buick, GMC is great as well!!  I can honestly say living in Tyler for the past 13 years we have NEVER shopped locally for a vehicle.
