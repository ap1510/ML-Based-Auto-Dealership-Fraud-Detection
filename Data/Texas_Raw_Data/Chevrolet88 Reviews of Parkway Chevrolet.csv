0,"April 20, 2020",Just left Parkway. No one else there shopping but myself & husband. Salesman located vehicle we were inquiring about and then left to find out if it was available. Came back and told us it was a fleet vehicle and left again to find out if he could sale it. We finally left after waiting about 10 minutes. Nothing on website said it was a fleet truck. This was a 2019. Salesman should know his inventory better. ,1.0
1,"February 29, 2020","Bought a Silverado 1500 Feb 22nd, had a good overall buying experience with Parkway Chevrolet Tomball.  Shawn, my salesman, made my experience virtually painless.  Also worked with GM Whitney, he had a pretty straightforward approach.  I would recommend the dealership for your next Chevrolet purchase.

2,"February 17, 2020","We bought a Silverado 1500 June last year, this year when it was time to change my husband's truck we shopped around but didnt find what we were looking for, so we went to Parkway again to see... Christopher, Dara, Ruben, Nairobi and Whitney made sure we felt extremely appreciated as returning customers and earned our business for a long time.  For any future trucks or car needs, we will definitely go to Parkway first!  Thank you for an awesome experience!",5.0
3,"December 24, 2019","This place has the worst customer service of any Chevrolet dealerships in Houston. Their service manager Joe something or other would rather argue than service paying customers. I went to Sterling McCall Chevrolet on I-45 North and he said ""What can we do to earn your business?' I said ""You just did."" I wouldn't send my worst nightmare to Parkway Chevrolet service department.",1.0

5,"November 20, 2019","I dropped off my truck to have the A/C repaired and a GM recall software update performed. When I got my truck back, a notice on my dash stated ""Grade Brake Active"", and the transmission would downshift through the gears for no reason. I took it back and showed them the problem. They said it was a module in the transmission. It cost me $554.00 to have it repaired. 3 days later the same problem arose again. I called and told them what was going on and they told me it would be another $800.00 to fix the problem. They didn't even have my truck in their possession when I got the repair quote. Why did they not fix the problem when they had the vehicle? And, how did they know what the problem was without even having my vehicle in their service department????
If I have to spend my hard earned money to fix a problem, I will be spending at another dealership. I'll NEVER set foot at Parkway Chevrolet again!",1.0
6,"September 05, 2019"," had my Chevy Traverse taken to this dealership for a  shifting problem, in July 2019,  Their  advisor, Gerald, diagnosed the issue as a broken engine mount as the cause, which was replaced and charged to my card. After getting my SUV back, following day ,  the problem persisted , and when we returned with the same complaint, he  diagnosed it  now as a  broken transmission part, for which a  new quotation of 6k was prepared.  Actually  initial diagnosis was incorrect for which the company should be held responsible , but the dealership refused to return the amount. I believe that this is a fraud to the customer , since the mechanical issue was incorrectly diagnosed initially and that should not have been charged. The dealership has not responded to our complaint, and no redressal has been seen, Company should return the  amount charged for work which was never needed  I would definitely not suggest  this dealership for any business",1.0
7,"July 09, 2019","It is summer time and driving without A/C is not an option.  My 2005 Trailblazer with 145000 miles for the first time had a real A/C problem.  I was prepared for being without it for a few days, but Gerald took it in on a Monday morning appointment, gave me a diagnosis in early afternoon, then installed a new fan, schrader valves, recharged, tested and returned to me that same Monday evening.  Really great service.",4.8
8,"May 11, 2019","I purchased a 2017 CT6 from Manual Torres. It only had 3,000 on it and the disclosures indicated there was no prior damage the vehicle and no work had been done to it. After purchasing it, i took it to a body shop to have a body kit and spoiler installed. The body shop owner immediately noticed damage. Upon further inspection, there was paint chipping off and peeling. I contacted Manny and his managers, Jerrod and Andrew. Since they sold me the car with the understanding that it had not been damaged, I was hoping they would do what is right and pay for repairs since I had just purchased it. They were extremely unhelpful and they sold me a car with defects, didn't disclose them and are now are making me be responsible for an $851 repair. I would not recommend working with Parkway Chevrolet.

Today I went to pick up my license plates and figured I'd talk to them in person before writing a review and I spoke with Andrew.  He just doesn't seem to care that the dealership sold me a car they stated had no damage.  I have the report and I have messages from Manuel Torres stating their report said it had no damage.  

Why can't dealerships just do the right thing for customers.  I know what ""As-is"" means for a used car, but I also know that if you tell me there is no damage and then I find out there is, you should should take care of it.

10,"February 14, 2019",We have been really pleased with the service at Parkway. The last 3 vehicles we bought from them and used them for service. The buying experience has always been so above the other dealerships. Looking to soon buy my next auto from them as well.  ,5.0
11,"February 01, 2019","Brought my new 2018 Corvette into the dealership Service department for the 2nd of 3 ""free"" oil changes.    The service department technician argued with me about the proper oil for the car, eventually realizing he was wrong about the proper oil required by the car.

To avoid the difficulty I'd encountered previously, I had my oil changed by a professional garage.   The oil filter installed on the Corvette by Parkway was the WRONG oil filter.  (PF-48 vs PF-64).    There is even a service bulletin about not using the PF-48 in any circumstance.   

Calling the Service Manager, nor any other member of Parkway Chevrolet had any effect.  In fact, the Service Manager was supposed to call me back several days later about the issue and failed to return my call.  

If you get service work done at Parkway Chevrolet, do so at your own risk.  Buyer beware.  ",1.2

17,"August 08, 2018","Recently I recieved a letter from Chevy corporate office of how there was a defective part identified and if already replaced Chevy will reimburse me.  Actually the letter has NO CHARGE capitalized and in bold.  The letter goes on to explain to complete the claim form attach invoice and receipt and send to the dealer. Parkways, Joe Miller, promptly called to say that they would not reimburse my $100.00 deductible because I happened to have another defective part installed that had to be ordered from a previous service call.  SO let me sum this up:
Chevy solicted me to send in my claim.
Chevy now wants to argue with me about rimbursement they offered in the first place!

Still own a 1999 Chevy Silverado, last 3 trucks were Chevy. Last three cars were Chevys, two of which were purchased at Parkway.  Will not be shopping at Parkway again!",1.0

21,"December 24, 2017","My car wouldn't start and local repair shop could not figure it out. The Parkway Chevrolet passed the car through a computerized analysis and gave a prompt list and estimate of all that was wrong and needed attention. 6 year old car. The agent sent me a quick link to sign up for the GM BuyPower card that I could use to pay the exorbitant amount. The report looked valid and nothing that seemed over-serviced or over-charged - although  I do not know what the std labor charges are supposed to be. At least they did not say I had to fix something that was fine. The agent had a personal touch in dealing with customers.
I felt that my car was safe to drive after this.",5.0

29,"August 19, 2017","
Hands down the worst experience I've ever had with a car & dealership. Not only did they sell me a defective 2016 Corvette, they are not working with me in anyway to resolve the issue aside from allowing me to take my car in over and over and over for service. Rear differential was the FIRST issue, immediately after I put down $15,000 on this car. They decided charging me for 2 new TIRES would be easier than replacing the differential. I have sent dozens of emails and calls. The first time I had my car in service it was there for NINE days. This last time they had it for ELEVEN days. They give me a completely filthy loaner each and every time I have to take my car in. I have been through this with GM before with a Hummer that was defective, & did not have anywhere NEAR this much trouble with the dealership or with GM. I simply asked them to apply my down payment and my paid monthly payments to another corvette,  instead of my having to file with GM to buy back the vehicle. There has been absolutely   Zero indication that GM cares to uphold their name and back this product, & Parkway has no interest in maintaining the integrity of the Durdin name.  I explained to them very clearly that I have been paying close to $900 a month for a car that has not been running properly since I bought it FROM THEM , on top of the fact that it has been in service equating to close to an entire month collectively. I afforded them the opportunity to take the vehicle back and put me into another one, and they have elected to treat me with nothing but absolute disregard. The dealership doesn't care in the least about ANY OF THIS.  They have dismissed every issue with this car, just so I will 'go away'. 
UPDATE AUGUST 18,2017: car was towed in b/c it wouldn't move out of park. Dave Ramsey was polite and helpful. But now?? TRANSMISSION SHIFT CONTROL HAD TO BE REPLACED. YES, ANOTHER MAJOR ISSUE.  I got my car back to find they left me with ZERO GAS AND MY CAR WAS FILTHY INSIDE AND OUT. I  Heard back from FORBES DURDIN TODAY AUGUST 19,2017 AND HE TOLD ME TO ""take my business elsewhere"". Nothing more. You spend $60,000 on a vehicle and this is the Parkway standard! ",1.0

Victoria Holmes and Shawn Babineaux did an outstanding job with the vehicle selection and closing the deal on the 2017 Silverado.  They helped me find the exact truck that I was looking for and even helped me add a few after market options that made the truck an exact fit for what I was looking for.

Excellent experience and very highly recommended.

As  a loyal customer of theirs since 08 and Five new vehicles  this is the way they treat LOYAL CUSTOMERS They would not let me use my  GM supplier discount or give me the 1000 incentive rebate that they get back from GM  Stay clear of SHARKWAY CHEVROLET",1.0

Rear differential was the FIRST issue, immediately after I put down $15,000 on this car. I have  now filed with my attorney and will follow with GM, following dozens of emails and calls.

The truck I was interested in was sitting in the parking lot all by itself when I arrived. It took a very short time for the appraisal on my trade, to close the deal and finish the paperwork.

42,"June 05, 2016","My car was losing oil and I went to get an engine oil consumption test. I explained the issue to the service guy and he said they would change the oil, while talking down to me as if I don't know how much oil goes into my own car. I repeated that I needed a consumption test, not just an oil change, and he went online and printed out a sheet, told me I have to measure the oil myself and fill out the sheet, then go to any Chevy service center when the change oil light comes on. 3k miles later I check in at another Chevy dealership and they told me that was completely wrong. They have to change the oil and they have to track and test it and I have to bring it back to the same dealer in 2k miles. Beyond that, parkway scheduled me with this one other guy on Saturday then I go to find that guy doesn't even work Saturdays. It's clearly mismanaged and their service guys don't know really basic processes.",1.8
43,"May 21, 2016","I met Jacki in 2006 as a brand new salesperson. I had the privilege to manager her and watch her grow. She has become a smart and customer oriented sales Wonder Woman. That was apparent with my experience with her when I bought my car with her. She was on top of things and an advocate of her customers. Great experience and very proud of her growth and ingenuity. I highly recommend you buy from her and tell your family and friends.
I cannot give a 5 star rating for the entire dealership as some knuckle head on the desk named Jarrod (I think) had the audacity to call the F&I guy to ask if I was for real before letting me take the car to be looked at. If he wanted to know he could have spent more that the 30 seconds he took to shake my hand and leave. I was a sales manager for 15 years and I got to know my customers personally to make sure their experience was great from top to bottom. The F&I guy should also keep his deep sigh of frustration at a lower level when walking out of the office because I had a question he couldn't answer. My time is just as valuable as his.
Jacki more than made up for it however. ",3.2

51,"December 09, 2015","My wife just picked up our Traverse We spent 1,723 dollars the car was dirty it had some air freshener sprayed in it to cover up some shop smell I am guessing. The low air pressure tire sensor said 27 psi. The car was dropped off on a Monday , Tuesday it was looked at, I was advised the power steering  and the coil would be covered under the extended warranty. The motor mount would be covered under the GM powertrain warranty. I was also tolled the brakes needed to be done as well. It took one day to get the extended warranty approved by the provider the service advisor had the brakes done on that day. He said the car would be ready Thursday or Friday. Thursday he informed me that I now needed struts because the last time the car was raised up they stuck in the extended position. My first quote with  Larry the service advisor was for a little over 1,100 dollars now there was an added 600 dollars. I was on my way to pick the car up on Friday And received a phone call that the car would not be ready until Tuesday because no one had checked to see if a motor mount was in sock. I did get a loaner car on Saturday this did help for the weekend. Tuesday Larry called me Late in the day saying the car was ready and the bill was over 2,000 dollars. I went over the bill with him discussing what he had tolled me previously. He came up with 1,723 amount that I paid. There was numerous time I tried to call my service advisor over the week the message usually picked up, If I pressed 1 to speak to another advisor I got the message all service advisors were busy,this seemed odd to me.

54,"September 29, 2015","I bought my ""new"" 2013 Spark from Mac Haik (it had 287 miles on it at purchase) in November 2013 or so. I soon realized the ac was ""intermittant"" (at best), and that there was a recall for this defect. Under the worst-case scenario of this recall the a/c compressor required to be replaced. I took it to Parkway Chevrolet in Tomball (closest to my house) around May 2014, still under warranty (~32k miles), and they replaced the compressor, and I drove away happy with the a/c working.

Later, at roughly 40k miles, I noticed the a/c operating intermittantly. It would cut out for about a second or two every now and then. This was evidenced by a change in the temperature and smell of the conditioned air.

Knowing that I was beyond the warranty period, but also knowing that an ""intermittant a/c"" issue existed with that year and model, I called Parkway Chevrolet to see if my issue might still somehow be covered. 

Parkway gave me the number for GM Customer Assistance. I called them and explained my problem.
They seemed to agree there might be a problem and gave me a case number and told me it was good to use at Parkway as a chit for the cost of examining my vehicle for the intermittant a/c issue.

So this morning, I drove my Spark ( of which I have only seen 2 other Sparks in my entire driving career) to Parkway, explained my issue to the Service Rep, and gave him my case number. The Rep said his Service Manager had received no prior notification of my case, had no way to look up my case number, and would need $130 to look at my car. I told the Service Rep to gimme my car back...

With an out of warranty car issue such as this, I would have been surprised to have gotten a positive resolution (i.e. my intermittant a/c fixed) . What disappointed me most was their unwillingness/inability to reference the GM Case Number given me by Mickey. I even showed the Service Rep the email with the case number from GM Customer Service, but he said all contacts are issued a case number and unless his Service Manager received an email telling him of my specific problem, I am SOL.

I left disappointed and angry.

I needed to get a constant Air Bag issue fixed under warranty before a weekend trip and time was running out.  The other dealer gave no indication it would be fixed anytime soon so I was forced to look elsewhere.  They even denied the fluid change service I requested because i wanted to go with expensive synthetic fluid. Said they can only put OEM fluid back in.  I even told them I didn't care about warranty.  My Camaro is modified and drivetrain warranty is voided anyway.  Basically no service at all at Buckalew.

To my surprise when I called the folks at Parkway Chevrolet it was a complete new ball game.  They were super friendly.  Got my car in the same day and had my Air Bag issue fixed and fluid changed to synthetic by the very next morning.  I'm quite sure they have more techs on hand and can handle more cars in the service department even with all the recalls and such going on.  

Extremely pleased with Parkway Chevrolet and David Croft my service advisor.

I've always disliked going car shopping but he made the experience worth it. I will definitely be going back to see him for my next purchase! I live 60+ miles from Parkway but its worth that drive! Ask for Ryan Smith when you go! ",5.0
60,"February 15, 2014",Completely unethical dealership. Made a deal last night. They placed a $5k deposit on this vehicle. Scheduled a $250 oneway flight for next saturday. Salesmen calls me back today says they sold the vehicle on me. Spoke with the GM and he won't even re-imburse me for my flight. Buyer beware. This is the epitomy of snakeoil tactics.,1.6
61,"December 27, 2013","Buyers beware, i recently purchased a 2013 camaro and every once in a while, the brakes will sound like a bus. Parkway ( Joe Barrios ) has pulled out the rules from GM and states that squealing brakes is an accepatable characteristic of this type of vehicle. They have declined to fix the problem for a car two months old. This is the poorest service department I have ever worked with and will never purchase a car from this dealership again. 

I hope your brakes don't mistake you for a BUS!!!!!!

62,"October 01, 2013","Parkway Chevrolet in Tomball Texas is just another unscrupulous car dealer.  Buyer Be Aware!  If you are looking for a deceitful dealer, look
no further because this is the place.  A dealer is only as good as their word.  Their motto:  Lies and Deception.  I will never purchase another
vehicle from Parkway Chevrolet nor will I recommend Parkway to anyone.",1.5
63,"June 29, 2013"," I am writing in response to a recent purchasing experience at Parkway Chevrolet located in Tomball, TX.  I am a resident of Washington State and have thus far been a lifelong customer of the GM brand as an owner of three Escalades and located my second Corvette on the internet, which was located at Parkway Chevrolet.  As a continued client of GM, I deemed it necessary to share my unsatisfactory purchasing experience from Parkway Chevrolet.GM’s strong principles guided by safety and quality first are what retain me as a client, but my recent experience did not earn my confidence that these principles are relevant at Parkway Chevrolet from where  I purchased a 2010 Corvette and received unsatisfactory service with meeting my needs and connecting with me on my terms.  As an out of state buyer, I requested assistance with shipping the vehicle along with requesting dealer window tinting services, all of these requests were denied by the dealership with no consideration.  Additionally, I was informed to expect my purchasing documents Saturday via overnight delivery service; and again, I was left disappointed with Parkway Chevrolet’s attention to detail and inability to perform resulting in my documents arriving Monday, which delayed shipping the vehicle causing an undesirable timeline.  Most importantly, the Corvette I purchased is a GM Certified vehicle and I was left appalled with the condition in which it was delivered to me.  The Corvette had a small chip in the windshield and was left unfilled, a lug nut was missing from a wheel, and there is a large gaping hole in the undercarriage of the vehicle.  The sales associate represented to me the “car is pristine condition with no physical damage” and initialed off on the chipped windshield while knowing the car will be shipped to California where I planned to pick up the car and drive it to Washington; unfortunately, now I am left with a windshield crack that has exponentially spread to a large crack and can no longer be filled.The culture at Parkway Chevrolet does not meet the culture principles of GM, I did not feel mutually respected with this purchase, as my calls were left unanswered, unattended, treated in a condescending manner, and was informed by the sales and finance representative they were too busy to talk to me.Additionally, my conversations with the dealership regarding the unrepresented damages to the car were dismissed by Parkway Chevrolet.This was my first experience with purchasing a vehicle in a nontraditional manner and I received nontraditional service leaving me disappointed and unexcited with my purchase.  I hope you are able to use this feedback to coach and train your dealerships to become innovative with nontraditional purchases and improve their customer service skills at Parkway Chevrolet. 

 

Sincerely,

Mr.K

66,"April 14, 2013",    Making a deal on used vehicle went quickly and smooth.  Dealer actually inspected vehicle and made necessary repairs.  Dealer left repair ticket and maintenance update on front seat.  A visual check under hood and under vehicle showed that repairs were actually done.  This builds trust in a dealership.  I will buy again from Parkway.  ,5.0
67,"February 19, 2013","Salesmen are very nice and courtesy.  The dealership does NOT negotiate on internet pricing or offer incentives like all other dealerships in the Houston area.  Their service department did not even know how to properly work on a Chevy Equinox.  Had better service on oil changes from Wal-Mart of all places.  At least they knew how to reset the oil change light gauge.  It took 5 technicians and the computer analyzer guy working on the vehicle and finally the woman who took the service order looked it up in the owners manual on how to reset it.  

We then purchased a used vehicle purchased a used vehicle, and they tried raising the price on the deal by 400 dollars over what was quoted on the internet.  Once they changed that and we finalized the deal they hand us a set of keys with only one that would work inside the ignition without busting all the plastic.  We knew we were purchasing used as is, but we never saw second set of keys until after everything was signed and done.  $200 dollars to replace and they would not accept it as their fault said be glad we have on set of keys that worked.  I understand dents scratches, pieces missing out of the car...earphones needed to be totally replaced due to crumbling apart.  However, you would think a major component like a key getting broke off in the ignition would be something worth working with us on, but we were rudely told We have no money to help you, and again...Be GLAD you have one that works!  To me this dealership has nice friendly sales people but once you get past that you get into Inexperienced Service Technicians and Unsociable rude finance department.  It seemed to me like if your not made of money....do not even BOTHER going there!  Not the dealership for you.  ",2.8

70,"July 20, 2012",My wife and I bought a Chevy from the dealer got a great price. After two days of owning the vehicle we had to take it in for service work. Parkway will make apointments but will not keep them. When buying the car we had a 630pm appointment to sign paper work it was after 800pm before we made it to a office. We had a 2pm appointment to drive with the service tech. My wife drove off the lot at 228pm after the service tech left her waiting. At one point we had to keep two of the service works from have a argument about a rental car for use. If you value your time go some were else. We got a great deal on the car but was not worth the headache. We returned the car and are out looking again. Best move we could make. Sales people are great every thing after that point was very bad. ,2.6

No matter how you ask them to repair the problem or exchange the car with another one, they wont. They want you to trade it in and starrt over like buying a new one with tremendous increase in a monthly payment. I am extremely disappointed in this branch. For about 6 months I tried to allow them to fix the problem. They simply wont. I felt tricked. My family's SAFETY is jeopardised each time I put them in this car. Worst is, I have to keep paying for it for 6 more years.",1.8

75,"October 20, 2011","My wife and I were looking to trade in a smaller vehicle for a larger vehicle because of children births. Knowing exactly what we were looking for, I contacted just about every dealership in Houston (not kidding) to explain the situation we had and the vehicle we wanted. Parkway was one of two dealerships that actually took my phone call serious. They took my information and called me back within 1 hour of the initial call. We discussed the specifics then I made the trip down to the dealership. Every single thing that was told to me on the phone was there waiting for me when I arrived. I spent approximately 1 hour on the lot and the deal was made. To top it off, I had to depart the dealership to attend to other matters and asked if the vehicle and paperwork could be ready for me to come by the next morning and finalize the details, and guess what, I got there at 0900 the next morning and all I had to do was inspect the vehicle, walk in and sign paperwork. Everything was there waiting on me! I can't explain how important and happy that made me feel about doing business with these folks.

This dealership and its people will do what it takes to make your day and experience special! I will certainly be doing business with them in the future. 

Thanks.

76,"October 03, 2011","I was interested in a used vehicle I had seen on the internet. When I chatted online with a used car sales rep I was told the price listed was the best price they could offer me. Days later, I checked the same car again and it was listed 500 dollars less. So I again inquired, but this time I called directly to the dealership. I requested to speak to the person I had chatted with (Brent) however I wasn't able to get a hold of him. So I asked for someone in the used car sales dept and was passed over to a rep named Gabriel Cortez. I told him I wanted a purchase quote faxed to me because I had my own financing and lived another city. He said he would call me back in an hour...but never did. Several hours later, I called again and spoke to Gabriel Cortez who seemed surprised no one had called me back with the information. About 10 minutes later, a lady by the name of Kim Holick (who claimed to be a sales floor manager) called me. This lady was extremely rude and unprofessional. She completed ignored what I wanted and instead tried to push me into giving them a down payment, my SSN and personal information and insisted I get financing with them. Since I live out of town, I told her I didn't want to commit to anything until I saw the car and for the moment I only wanted for her to fax me a purchase quote. During my phone with her I received another call from a Mr. Spruell. I told him I had already been dealing with Kim Holick and he said he was going to check on her deal for me. Shortly after, she called me again very upset and told me the deal was off and didn't want my business anymore. I was in complete disbelief. I told her the reason I had been talking to so many people was because no one ever got back to me with the car information. This lady was completely out of line, aggressive and not to mention very very very RUDE! She went as far as telling me I could write whatever reviews I wanted but I just better not set foot into her dealership. I'm taking my business somewhere else. Would not recommend or buy from this dealership. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! ",1.0

I can remember them telling me ""We are not like other dealerships, we don't add in hideden costs"".  My mistake is trusting them and not looking over the billing statement line by line.

They had added $275 for window tint and $111 for theft protection, making the price of the vehicle $25,581.  I felt like they misled me and its my mistake for not catching the mistake before I signed the papers.  I pointed this out to the people at the dealership and they told me it was too late I had signed the papers.  Forbes Durdin, the sales manager was very rude and said many unprofessional remarks wnen I asked him about refunding me the $407.
