3,"November 23, 2019",Poor service.  Representative would not provide update on time for my appointment when asked.   When I asked again I was just told “soon”.  An oil change should never take 2 hours on an appointment.   A walk in would be understandable.  If they were unable to service my car at the appointment time I should have been notified rather than being trapped at the dealer.  ,1.0
4,"October 05, 2019","In my opinion, the service shop at Robbins Nissan is horrible. After dealing with them on a few occasions, I have found them to be totally incompetent as well as being very, very DISHONEST. After my last encounter with them, I'm starting to question the previous work that they have performed on my vehicle. In my opinion, you should steer clear of this dealership. You'll be thankful in the long run.",1.8

6,"July 31, 2019","The reason I give my experience a great review was since the Sales Consultant and the salesman were very welcoming and helpful towards me , they communicated very well about the information about buying a vehicle. Mostly importantly i would recommend this place , it was a very good experience.",4.8
7,"July 12, 2019","We purchased a Nissan Armada Platinum on June 29, 2019. We went through the typical price negotiation and then waited several hours to finalize the deal with the finance manager. After signing our first few documents we got to the page with the mileage which was 5,700! Turns out this a “demo” car. After initial shock we (regretably) proceeded. The next day we went out to the car in the bright daylight (it had been stormy and overcast the day before) and saw that the interior was scuffed up, the exterior had a good number of rock chips, a starburst windshield crack, a very scratched up cargo plate and a damaged rear seat. The car we traded in was actually in better condition. The dealer agreed to take care of it. They had it for four days. They repaired the windshield. They repainted the front and rear bumped and left overspray. They did NOT replace the cargo plate. They did NOT fix the damaged seat or any of the interior scuffs which are significant. Basically, it feels like we bought a used car in “good” versus “excellent” condition. And...of couse we are starting ownership 5700 miles into the warranty. My point in all of this is that the dealership was not up front about this being a demo car. We would have negotiated very differently. Be very wary of buying here and make sure you do a very detailed inspection before you sign anything. ",1.6

10,"October 26, 2018","I have bought  2 cars from them. Sales seem ok, but paperwork and correct disclosure is a major issue. Its been 3 months and continuing,  to get a GAP refund after being told incorrect information, and ""Rod"" in finance passing the buck with incorrect information.  It is one thing to tell the truth and know what you are telling the customer, but to give wrong information and be arrogant about it is unacceptable.",3.0
11,"May 11, 2018","Roger McAdoo was attentive to us from the moment we met him.  He asked what our preferences were, then worked to find exactly what we wanted.

He stayed with us through the entire purchase and truly cared about what we wanted.  He is what I'call a ""customer's salesman"".  Very good with people.  Very good for repeat business for the dealership.  A good role model for other salesmen.

13,"September 21, 2017","If I could I’d give them 0 stars. Make sure y’all read all reviews before even stopping by to browse their dealership so y’all can save some trouble and time.
My previous car was totaled due to the floods in August, so my insurance paid it off. My husband and I went ahead to purchase a vehicle from them over the weekend of 09/15/17 to be exact. I did not mind a broken windshield that the vehicle we got had because they promised me they’d fix it and promised it’d be ready that same day. Then, they called my husband at around 6pm that it was not ready, yet again they promised it’d ready by the next day. And, again! IT WAS NOT READY! I honestly needed a car to get to work so my husband And I picked it up how it was so I could get to work the next day. They told me to take it the next day because for sure they were going to have it ready, they said they had and assured me they had the glass it just needed to be installed. Okay no, they lied AGAIN!! and not just that! They even lied about having the glass! They did not even have it!!!they changed the whole story on my husband when he went to drop it off !!At this point I do not even know what to do! I am very upset because this is day 5, 09/20/2017!! And my car is still not ready and on top of that all the LIES And their stories that they like to make up.  Although they gave us a rental on day 5, that is not enough and did not make up for everything that they are making me go through.  Also, their employees don’t have respect for customers. When I was explaining the situation to one of them he was laughing in my face. BAD CUSTOMRR SERVICE! My main concern is that they lie non-stop. SAVE YOURSELF SOME TIME, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE. Read all reviews they are mostly NEGATIVE so that says a lot. I Should've done that before coming to Robbins Nissan. I DO NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL.  

*UPDATE: 09/21/2017* I decided or was convinced by my husband to give them 1 more day and I agreed. Okay, today in the morning my husband called and told them to have it ready by 3pm if not that we’d just pick it up because we cannot waste more time with them, when my husband was on the phone with them one of the salesmen confessed to my husband that he’s just been telling us what his manager tells them to say that its really out of the sales team control. Okay, so now, I Know that it was THE MANAGER LYING AND MAKING UP STUFF ALL ALONG. WOW, what kind of manager is that? HORRIBLE!
Never acquiring another vehicle from them and if I could and if I knew how terrible of a dealership this is, I would’ve never given them my business. 
*********STAY AWAY FROM ROBBINS NISSAN! *****************
And read all reviews, NEGATIVE.


On the other hand, ROBBINS CHEVY is beyond better, very professional and even their building looks better and more professional, the employees there are very helpful and professional.  We bought our previous car there and it was Amazing!! Never had a problem with them and they do not lie!!!",1.2

15,"April 02, 2017","I have been researching trucks and finally decided that the Frontier would be the best fit for me. I started my arduous task of searching on the internet, requesting ""Best Price!"". Late Thursday night I say a Frontier on Robbins website that was the color and packages that I was looking for.  To my surprise, I received a call from Micheal @ 6:30 AM  Friday morning as well as an email.  I thought I started my work day early! I replied to Micheal requesting what was the  ""true"" price including dealer add on's & destination charges. I explained to Micheal that I was very busy and I didn't have time to come in and play the let's talk game. I told him give me your best drive out price. Micheal did exactly what I asked without the normal back and forth game you normally have to play. Once I had their best price via email we moved to my trade in.  After I had the assurance we could get to where I wanted to be, I made an appointment to stop by that evening. Micheal had his manager talk with me about what Robbins could give me since we were $700 from where I wanted to be. David asked for a few minutes and came back with what I wanted.  Drove out with a new Frontier and one of the best car buying experience I have ever had. I'm a tough person to sell a vehicle to and Micheal exceeded my expectations! I would highly recommend using him.",5.0

I've always had a great experience when dealing with Jimy Casas, he has always made sure all of my new car needs and new car experiences have been met.  Jimy has always followed up with me to make sure everything was working out well for me and my car.   He has continuously provided 110% true customer service!

I went to the dealership the next day and drove the vehicle home.  Went back next day and signed the papers.  It took a total of about 10 minutes to complete paperwork.

29,"January 26, 2016","Robbins Nissan provided me with an excellent experience from the first moment I walked into the dealership!  I had the distinct pleasure of working with Rizwan Durrani and Bobby Waheed to trade in my vehicle for another pre-owned automobile.  Both helped me understand all my purchase options and I appreciated that there was no ""hard-sell"" or pressure to purchase.  Instead, I was able to evaluate, completed the test drive and drove out of the lot with a beautiful car that was just what I needed.  Efrain did all the contract paperwork efficiently and explained everything clearly so I understood the financial commitment (I even got a fantastic deal!).  The staff was extremely courteous, professional and knowledgeable, and as someone who has worked in pre-owned automobile sales myself many years ago,  I appreciated the upfront, no-nonsense method of doing business.  I will DEFINITELY return to Robbins Nissan for my next car purchase.",5.0

39,"October 26, 2015","I took my car to get serviced on a Friday. I needed an oil change, my windshield wiper was broken-several minor things. I dropped it off in the morning and had a coworker take me to work and figured I would return for it at lunch time. I had several work emergencies happen that day, and was not able to take a lunch break and had to stay late at work. 
 At 6:20 when I was finally able to leave work, I realized that the service department was closed and I had forgotten all about picking up my car. I called and spoke to the manager on duty and he was beyond helpful and friendly! They went the extra mile to get my keys out of the service department and make sure I was able to get my car that evening. 
They never acted annoyed or inconvenienced with me-just treated me with friendliness, kindness, and helpfulness. Everyone I dealt with was incredible and Paul Poock made me feel so grateful I chose Robbins Nissan for my service needs ",5.0

Friendly Staff.

I felt really comfortable going to this dealership.

Mr. Bobby Waheed was Wonderful !!!

We exchanged about 70 e-mails before I actually went to the dealership.

He made everything so easy for me.
Not once did I feel pressured .
I felt very comfortable.

I wasn't sure exactly the type of vehicle I wanted, but Mr. Bobby helped me with such patience.

I decided on the Nissan Leaf.

Mr.Bobby told me that 
I could contact him anytime if 
I ever needed anything. 
That really meant a lot.

43,"September 29, 2015","The main reason I bought a Nissan was because I have seen my mother and sister get such great service on their cars. Brock, the service manager, and Ed, our go to service coordinator, build a relationship with the owners and can explain what is going on with the car. My family has never been ""taken advantage of"" in the service department. After seeing the level of respect and customer service given to my family when it was time to buy a new car I chose to buy a Nissan based on the customer service department. I can testify that you will not regret buying a car and working with Robbins Nissan. Now me, my mother, and my sister all have new Nissan vehicles and always take our cars in to be serviced.

44,"September 28, 2015","It was almost 9pm and my wife said ""Let's go look at the Nissan's""..... We were looking at vehicles at a Chrysler dealership next door... She was undecided and after a long day of shopping for vehicles the last thing I wanted to look at was at ""nissan"" cars.... We've had 2 Dodge and 4 Chrysler vehicles since I've been with my wife... So I was pretty reluctant to see them....  I told her ""I don't want to""... As she gave me the ""look"" we went....LOL...... We looked around at the pre-owned section and I made eye contact with a ""salesman"".... I told my wife ""oh, here we go""... Enter here Mr. Valles.... With a simple and respectful voice he greeted us.. It was in a way that made us feel important and welcomed... He showed us the vehicles that attracted my wife and so on.... I'm here looking at the time and it's past 9pm and he's not rushing us in any way nor did I feel awkward. ... In comes the 2012 Nissan Maxima SV.... It grabbed my wife's attention as well as mine.... He actually took us on a test drive and on 2 different models... Other dealers would of told us to come in, in the morning, ""I know from experience"".... He answered ALL my questions and removed all my doubts... He asked multiple times if we really wanted this Maxima. We left the dealer close to 11pm.... ""WOW"" I told my wife..... The next day we went back and drove off in our Certified Pre-owned Maxima.... This is an AWESOME car.... He has officially made us a NISSAN family.... Thank You sir for being a great salesman... If you are looking for a vehicle, I suggest you give him and this nissan dealer a visit... I have bad credit and I was put into this great ride... Tell him Mr.Lezama sent you.... You will not regret it...

47,"September 18, 2015","I purchased a 2011 Nissan pathfinder. On a whim my wife and I decided it was time to get another car to more comfortably accommodate our family and ended up striking out the first dealership we visited. We came home for lunch, saw a car that we liked at Robbins, and sent a web-based form to let the dealer know we were interested. Paul called back moments (seconds) later to let us know that we should come in and advised us that they might have a few other vehicles in our price range too. 

Paul sent us to John at the dealership, and his service was exceptional. The vehicle we first saw had been sold, but John was happy to show us several more and indulged my wife with a few that we hadn't even considered either. We ended up finding the Pathfinder and decided it would work well for us. Having three boys we weren't terribly concerned with much, but there was a cup holder that had come out of place in the back seat. We got it on paper without issue that it would be fixed. He walked us through financing, just to see if they could beat the preapproval we already had, and afterward we completed the sale. 

After I checked back with John, he let me know that the part was in his office and that we could come by and he'd even put it in for us. I would not have actually believed that we could get service like this while purchasing a used vehicle. After a bad start with a different dealer, this was even more apparent. Couldn't have been more satisfied. ",5.0

If you do decide to go to Robbins Nissan to buy a new car, I highly recommend asking for Bobby Welch in sales if you want that personal touch.  Bobby is trustworthy and will get you taken care of from start to end and then afterwards when you need servicing or anything else.  He has a very open communication and will give you his direct number to support you directly.
I also wanted to recognize Rebecca Oliver whom did all the the final paperwork.  Rebecca did an excellent job with going through all the paperwork (bill of sale, title,  financing, extended warranties, etc) in detail and answering all the questions that I had.

59,"July 09, 2015","I had been having trouble with my car and it had so many issues.  I had been putting so much $ into it for many different problems.  As I was about to go out of the state with my 2 young boys, I realized that I needed to have something that I could rely on.  I am a single mom and didn't have a large budget to work with as it was.  On a referral from a friend, I opted to go to Robbins to talk with Jordan.  I showed up at the dealer one evening to see what, if anything, he could do for me.  It didn't take long for him to greet me and he put me in the company of Courtney whom he said would assist me.  I truly was not expecting to get a new car as I was sure I wasn't able to do this.  Courtney discussed with me what I could afford and upon checking my credit, I found out it wasn't near as bad as I thought.  My other car appraised very low and I was upside down on the payment so I still didn't think I could get anything new.  Without going into a book about this experience, I was pleasantly surprised to realize that I COULD get a new car and that it was in my budget and that I qualified for it as well.  Initially, I didn't know if I would use this dealer or explore my options but after interracting with both Jordan and Courtney, I would have been crazy to go elsewhere!

67,"June 11, 2015",Emanuel Iboa provided the best service I've ever experienced when buying a car.  When I came to the dealership I told him I was only there to drive the vehicle as I had researched various vehicles and wanted to test drive them all before making a decision. He understood and didn't try to pressure me as he said he was confident that I would like this vehicle and return. He took my contact info and emailed me a link about the vehicle to help me make a better buying decision. He text me to let me know he was available should I have any questions (smart as then I had his contact info in my cell).  He contacted me just enough for me to know that he wanted my business and not too much that he drove me away (I don't care too much for pushy sales).  After all my research I came back to purchase the Nissan Murano.  He was very knowledgeable about the vehicle and spent over an hour going through ever option and answering every question I had.  Truly a remarkable experience!,4.8

74,"May 24, 2015"," I was apprehensive of working with a dealership regarding getting a fair price for my trade in.  I worked with and would like to Thank Paul Poock, and Roderick King for their professionalism and help.   They worked with my wife and I and provided a fair price for our trade in and met other dealers best Truecar price on the new vehicle.  The finance man who was Paul Christian did a great job working with me on different options and didn't try to make extra money on the back end of the deal like other dealerships.   Paul also did a great job at explaining all the warranties and allowed me to decide whether I was interested in purchasing the extra packages.  This is the second New vehicle I have purchased from Robbins Nissan in a year. I would purchase from Robbins Nissan again.

(Opportunities for improvement) - for detail shop and overall to entire team.
 
  1.  Recommend streamlining or expanding the detail shop. (currently 4 different dealers are funneling their new cars through the detail shop after the sale  to polish up and prepare cars for delivery and this process takes awhile)
  2. Whole sales process took 7 hrs. and we had a two year old with us.  We were very tired by the end of the day. Maybe there's a way to speed things along after numbers are agreed on?",4.4

I had already visited many dealerships and most were not very helpful or didn't seem like they were very interested in working to get a car that I could afford.   I was very surprised with the attitude that Courtney,the used car manager had.  She was very easygoing, not pushy, but made it clear that she wanted my business and would do whatever she could to get me a good deal.  I wound up buying a car with only 5,000 miles and the whole process was quick and relaxed, no pressure!  I got a great deal and am so happy with my car. I would definitely recommend this dealership to others.

89,"August 01, 2014","I visited this dealership a couple of times before deciding to buy a vehicle. From the get go everyone i met there was extremely friendly and very helpful. I would've loved to buy a car from them, but unfortunately (for them), they changed the price that I had originally agreed to. The three stars are for the customer service - J.D. and Bryce were awesome!

That being said, the sales manager, Barry, was shady as f*xx. I am eligible for a discount through the company I work for, which I explained to him during the short time I tried to negotiate. He tried to short me on it and say that he was giving me the discount, although I had visited the website myself and knew what it was supposed to be. It happens to be the website where dealership employees are supposed to get their pricing as well, which the salesman had no clue about and Barry refused to say it. This leads me to believe they probably hose their own employees. 

All in all, the customer service was great, but that's it. And because of that, I'll be more than happy to share that employee pricing website with any Nissan employee who is interested and hasn't been made aware of it by their manager.

90,"October 08, 2013",Worse experience I've had at a car dealership. They're a bunch of liars and crooks. After we offered a certain amount we were told that they would do it for the price. When I got there and filled out the credit app I was told they looked at the wrong car online and the price was 2k higher than what we had offered. The sales manager Sal was even talking to my husband on the phone and was about to pass the phone back to me and he told my husband here you can tell your wife that she is not getting the car. How unprofessional? Its the worse place you can shop for a car. All they do is lie to get you in and then change the story around. I would stay away from this place. All My friends and family have been warned to stay away!!,1.0
91,"May 23, 2013","I have lived in the area for 20 years and never heard one negative remark concerning this dealership and now I know why.  Jose, the salesman, was the most helpful, polite, knowledgeable auto salesman I have ever worked with, and I'm 64 years old.  He took care of my every request and introduced me to the New Car GM, Jimmy, who was just as graceful in his approach and was willing to not make me feel rushed nor pressured in any way.

I ended up purchasing a used beautiful Certified Nissan with only 31,000 miles that looked brand new at a fair price with a fair trade-in allowance.  That's when I met Leal, the Used Car GM who obtained my credit and as everyone, treated me with great respect.  The new car sales rep, Jose, stood by me the whole time.

Anyone looking for quality, respect and a good deal should go see Robbins.  I will be a lifelong customer.

93,"April 03, 2013","We went to Robbins Nissan on a Friday after work. We got there about 6 o'clock and met up with Bo (whom we had been talking to via e-mails for several days) and she started the buying process immediately. We were looking for a brand new Nissan Rogue but knew that our credit was too low to afford one. However, Bo worked his @$$ off to get us approved. We stayed with us until 10:30 that night trying to get us approved. The finance managers were total buttheads and were only nice to us AFTER we had gotten approved. But Bo made the visit worth our while. He fought long and hard for us to get approved. But 9 that night, it was already too late to submit our deal to the bank, but Bo called us the next morning before 10 to let us know he had gotten us approved and got our payments down to where we wanted them. Then, we went to the finance department to finish our paperwork and spoke with Perry, who is HA-LARIOUS! And he helped us out a whole bunch, as well.
Overall, their sales team are hard workers. Their finance guys are a bunch of pricks who stand up in the tower and look over the floor. Luckily, you deal 90% of the time with the sales team. Again, if you go, use Bo. He's a great guy and a hard worker and makes the experience enjoyable. There's a reason he sells the most cars there.",4.4
94,"March 14, 2013","Salesman (BO) was a great guy. I made an offer on a 2013 Pathfinder and he sent it to the sales mgr, Singh?, and he acted like we were wasting his time after making us wait for about an hour on him, his counter was ABOVE MSRP. Then he insinuated we couldn't afford the vehicle and should look at preowned. We left. We purchased the same vehicle with same package and more equipment two months later ( minus the $1000 worth of useless dealer tack ons, like invisible bumper shield, wax, etc) from Baker Nissan and had a very positive experience and received $4181 off MSRP and no F&I tricks or dealer ultra profit tackons. BTW, I gave Robbins no info on my personal stuff. I guess they judged us from the 10 yr old car we drove there in. Later, I emailed them , got a auto response that they would respond and never did.",1.5
95,"February 14, 2013","Let me just start off by saying I love my new car! My credit isn’t very good and it was a struggle to get into a NEW car.  I started off speaking to Bo, who was a great help and very patient with me.  The whole process took about a week due to the fact that I was looking around.  I had another dealership call me and tell me I was preapproved for ZERO DOWN up to 25,000.00!!! So I told Bo thank you for your help but I’m going with a different Nissan dealership.  He didn’t get mad, all he said was good luck and if you need anything give me a call.  Needless to say he knew all too well that this was just a sales call to get me in the door.  But he didn’t tell me anything because he knew that I would have thought he was just trying to keep my business.  This other dealership was a waste of my time!!! What did I do?  I called Bo the next day and told him about my horrible experience.  He never promised to put me in a car due to my credit but he worked really hard!  Bo called me and told me to come by and bring some key items I would need because he was working on a deal that he thought I would be very happy!  I got to the dealership and that is when I encountered Majid, as soon as I walked in the door he was there to greet me and keep me company as I waited for Bo.  After talking to Bo for days over the phone it was finally nice to put a face with a name.  Unfortunately he was  not able to get to me so I dealt with Majid who was very nice and a great guy!  I filled out paperwork and Majid made me feel at ease, I was extremely nervous on such a big buy.  But Majid was there to assure me that everything would be ok and talked to me about the warranty and all the great things about my new car.  Just as soon as I was almost done with my paperwork, Bo came in to check on me and sat and chat and he too made me feel very good about the car, the paperwork, the warranty, and everything else I had questions about. Over all Adorthus “BO” Cherry and Majid Calil are rock stars in my book!  Again I love my BRAND NEW 2013 VERSA!!!!  ",5.0

99,"August 22, 2011","I went into Robbins Nisssan to look at a used 2011 Altima Coupe. It was pretty much a base model with bluetooth and leather seats.  I test drove the car and talked to a sales guy. He asked me what it was listed on the internet. I wasn't sure and I said $22,500 (it was actually $23,948). Gave him my info and said I would be in touch because there were other cars that I wanted to look at it. His manager came in and tried to get us to purchase that day and was willing to negotiate even more. I politely declined as I wanted to still look at other vehicles. The sales guy called and left me a voicemail the next day checking in. I came back 2 days later with my parents so they could test drive the car. My sales guy wasn't there so we left and I decided to come back that Saturday.  Came back that Saturday and my sales guy already had a customer in his office (I did not make an appointment), so I decided to leave and just call and schedule an appt. I finally scheduled the appt and when I get to the dealership, my sales guy had left on a family emergency. Not a big deal but a phone call would have been nice so I didn't drive there for nothing. I decided to talk to another sales guy to see if we could agree on a # so I could finally purchase the car. The new sales guy goes to look for my paperwork that had been started with the $22,500 price on there and it had mysteriously disappeared. He comes back with a starting # of $22,900. $400 MORE than what I was originally starting at. We play a bidding war and he comes back and says $22,500 is the lowest he can go. I knew that couldn't be true because the manger that I originally met was willing to go LOWER the 1st day I test drove the car. I decided to leave. I figured when my sales guy went to work the next day he would call and  to see what happened and if I wanted to come back and try and make a deal. I waited 3 days and no call. I finally decided to call him and see if we could negotiate the price lower. He said he tried calling me a couple days before but he had the wrong # for me (even though he had previously left me a voicemail and we've called each other on our cell phones) and said he would talk to his manager and call me right back because he didn't want me to drive down there for nothing. He NEVER called me back. 

I actually want to thank that sales guy because I ended up going to Baker Nissan North and bought a BRAND NEW 2011 Altima Coupe with the convenience AND premium package for $24,250. Only $1750 more for a brand new altima coupe AND more options.

Robbins Nissan was by far the WORST dealership I have ever dealt with. Their customer service is HORRIBLE. If you want a good deal on a Nissan with great customer service, I would suggest Baker Nisssan North.",1.5
