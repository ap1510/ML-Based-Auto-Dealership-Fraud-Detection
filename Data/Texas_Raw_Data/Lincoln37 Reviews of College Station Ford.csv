1,"March 25, 2020","If I could give them ZERO stars I would. I inquired about a 2019 Lincoln MKC they had advertised. The price was, from my internet research, the lowest I could find. I am from Illinois and they are in Texas. I was willing to make arrangements to go to Texas to buy this vehicle. I asked the salesperson Jacob to send me a purchase contract with the breakdown of all the taxes, fees, & rebates. I was sent a screen shot from an old looking DOS computer program with the price of the car as listed on the internet and a lump sum of fees. I emailed my salesman Jacob back and asked him to send me a purchase contract with everything broken down. I received no response. I called him a couple of hours later and asked him for the same thing. Here is where things got slimy. He said ""Well my manager wants to make sure you are ok with the numbers"" I said ""I want to see how they got to the bottom line figure so could you please send me over a purchase contract breaking down the numbers."" His response was ""He said if you are ready to proceed to the next step, then we can get you all of that information"" I asked him ""What would that next step be?"" His response ""You need to talk to the finance manager first before we can send you the break down"" I explained that I am paying cash for the vehicle and won't need to speak with him/her until the transaction is almost complete. I asked again ""So you won't send me a purchase contract with the breakdown until I commit to the bottom line you sent me with no explanation on how you arrived at that number?"" He stammered a little and I finally said ""Nevermind, this isn't worth it and I will continue with another dealer."" Shockingly he said ""Well ok then, have a good night."" I have dealt with some very reputable dealers in my life but I now know why the auto industry has such a bad name. This dealership is the perfect example of shady business practices. I hope everyone who reads this, keeps this story in the back of their heads if they choose to do business with this dealer.",1.0
2,"December 01, 2018","Luke Holland is an incredible sales professional.  He always makes the customerâ€™s needs his number one priority.  He is knowledgeable, friendly, honest and truly cares about every customer.  I highly recommend consulting him before you make your next automotive purchase.  Heâ€™s the best! #GoSeeLuke! Luke went above and beyond in helping me with the purchase of my vehicle.  He asked thoughtful questions and made sure I was making a purchase that fulfilled my needs.  He was friendly, honest and made the experience incredibly fun and easy. The entire experience was great.  I enjoyed meeting everyone at the dealership and appreciated the culture College Station Ford strives to maintain.  Everyone is friendly and accommodating.",5.0
3,"November 20, 2018","I took my Ford Explorer to the body Shop for a simple work and it take them a month to do it , when I went to pick it up they forgot to put the back up camera on so I have to take it back and I donâ€™t know how long I have to wait until I get it back. Iâ€™m really disappointed I thought they were better . Never coming back ðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘ŽðŸ‘Ž",1.0
4,"May 15, 2018","I recently had a 2015 Fusion strand me on the road which is never a good thing.  I had the car towed to this dealership for repairs.  I hope the service repairs were done correctly - I guess time will tell.  

My issue is / was with Taylor and the overall service standards provided to me as a customer.  Each time for an updated status I was the one calling (three times over four days) to obtain this.  The only call from Taylor was to inform me the car was ready.  When attempting to pick-up the car neither Taylor nor anyone at the service counter would call Enterprise.  I would have called Enterprise to have them pick-up the rental car but they would not hold the key.  I have had trouble twice before with this same car at two different Ford dealerships and this was never an issue.  That said - College Station Ford is neither capable nor willing to provide much more than one phone call to say ""car is ready - come get it.""  

If I was going to buy a Ford - it sure as heck would never be from you.",1.0
5,"April 08, 2018","When you taek your car or truck into Quick Lane, is you do not not need anything they will still try to sell you something. Also they do not torque the wheel lug nits properly and you may drive out with a shimmy because the rotors are warped. It happened to me and my daughter in law. Neither of us will ever use them again. I have owned vehicles for over 40 years and have never had a warped rotor until I went to Quick Lane and they rotated my tires. I had to do a brake job then.",1.2
6,"June 12, 2017","We had a great experience on June 10, 2017.  Our salesman Ken was fantastic and VERY helpful.  He, along with his manager, negotiated a deal with the bank that we couldn't pass up.  The entire staff is very courteous and friendly.  We live two hours away and I will purchased a car from them again in the future.  ",5.0
7,"March 18, 2017"," I had an issue with my old truck payments and was look to get out of it. Steven Wiley at College Station Ford did a fantastic job finding me a great F150 in the price range I was looking for. He got me into a beautiful truck that was not only low payment that my previous truck but it turned out to be much nicer with a ton of cool feature. If y'all need a good, honest salesman, visit Steve at CS FORD! Really good guy and great prices!",5.0
8,"February 22, 2017","Purchased a certified pre-owned Ford Fusion from Tomball Ford (same owners) a little under two years ago. Great experience buying the car. Took my car into College Station Ford for a wheel bearing replacement (41k miles) on a Tuesday at 8:00am. I was told that they would start working on the car that day. Received a phone call at 4:00 saying they are just now taking it for a test drive and that he would call me back when they got back. Long story short, they had to order parts and didnt start working on it again till Wednesday around 4:00 I assume because I got another call saying they need to order more parts and that it wouldn't be ready for another day. If the items were not covered under warranty, I would by no means ever take my car back to College Station Ford due to poor service and being misleading. I would of rather paid $300 to have it repaired by a local shop same day, than have a dealer take 3 days. 

customer service representative is a very nice guy, but the service was pretty terrible. ",2.3
9,"February 16, 2017","I needed some help with my MKX.  It would not accept the fact that I had a key in hand, saying ""No key detected.""  Used my other key;  same problem.  I called your service department and spoke with John Green, one of the most pleasant persons I have ever encountered in a service department anywhere.  He told me what to do to start my car.  I will be bringing my car into your facility in a few days to have it inspected and to have my keys fixed.  Kudos to John Green.",5.0

11,"October 22, 2016","STEVEN WILEY was very helpful and respectful to my wife Lily and me from the moment we shook hands with him until the time we drove the vehicle off the sales lot. Steven reminded me before, during and after this sale, that he is a ""full service"" salesman. He reminded me if I needed anything; he is just a phone call away. He also said he would come to my home to personally instruct me on how to use the backup assist feature on my new truck. This has been an uplifting experience for the both of us to purchase this new vehicle, and we will most definitely recommend Steven Wiley to anyone looking to purchase a new vehicle. We got the deal we wanted, the truck we wanted, and the respectful service we appreciated. Thank you! Leonard & Lily Muesse",5.0
12,"October 12, 2016","I purchased a new vehicle on October 5, 2016 at College Station Ford and saless associate James Souter went above and beyond to get me into a new vehicle. Mr. Souter was extremely pleasant and courteous. I was very impressed with the customer service and friendliness of everyone at College Station Ford. I highly recommend anyone looking to purchase a vehicle to stop by College Station Ford. ",5.0
13,"October 07, 2016","I drove 4.5 hours to purchase a car from College Station Ford and I'm glad I did. The used car I purchased developed a problem a week after the purchase and their manager, David Levine,  paid to have it repaired at a dealer of the brand. It was an expensive repair. Thanks for stepping up to the plate and doing the right thing.",5.0
14,"August 17, 2016","I live 4 hours from Bryan and contacted the saleman by phone, we agreed on a price and the salesman confirmed there were no add-on or upsell costs, but failed to send a total or itemized cost.   The night before driving to Bryan is when I learned they added about $900 to the price, so I did not buy the car.   They were not professional, failed to call as promised, and misrepresented the facts.",1.0
15,"July 19, 2016","Grossly overpriced: got quoted over $500 to replaced a faulty door latch. My car is fairly new and two door latches have already failed. Additionally everytime there is a recall and I want to take my car, there is a couple of week wait time. However, if I call for another repair, somehow there is never a wait. ",1.4
16,"July 08, 2016","Ended getting a oil change for free and free filter on CSF . Manegement calls me 3 days later saying I need to pay them because they made a mistake and we're very rude and unprofessional, they tried to belittle me!!",1.0

18,"April 06, 2016","My daughter was in the market for a quality used car that was safe for her and her young family.  She had the pleasure of dealing with Gary Randall at College Station Ford.  Gary took the time to learn about her situation and what she could afford to spend and stay safely in her budget.  Gary was able to take the fear of being treated like a ""dumb girl"" out of my daughters mind and talk to her in a straight forward and honest manner that made her comfortable and confident.  My daughter had a budget in mind when she went in and knew exactly how much she wanted to pay down and what monthly payments she could afford.  Gary took that information and put her in an amazing 2014 Ford Taurus that is not only a great car for her, but is filled with great options and more than fits her needs for her family.  The kicker is that Gary not only met the expectations on the down payment and monthly payments she had in mind, but he was able to add in a warranty and gap insurance in the deal and stay below what she was willing to pay.  After comparing his deal with other dealers on the same make, model and mileage cars, we found that Gary had offered the best deal of any Ford Dealership in the Houston area.  If you want an honest salesman that will give his best to get you in a quality vehicle that you can truly afford, Gary Randall is your salesman.  Thank you Gary for taking care of my baby girl in a professional and compassionate way.",5.0
19,"April 04, 2016","I have two Ford trucks, one in which repairs were performed at College Station Ford, and the other only received an estimate. The first one was a fuel pump replacement that cost $900. We are still having issues with this truck dying, cutting out, etc. and feel it is either the pressure problem from the pump still or the pump wasn't the issue at all, so not sure if it was diagnosed properly.
The second truck had a small transmission leak at the front. It needed a front pump seal. The estimate I received was $2,100, which I can get a completely new transmission rebuild done for. 

They stated that the Torque Converter was bad and needed replaced, in addition to many other items that we found later did not have a problem. We took it to another national chain to get their opinion. There was absolutely nothing wrong with the Torque Converter and they only needed to replace the front seal(s). The repair cost under $700. 

So, we feel we were being taken advantage of here, so be very careful. They will tell you that you need to replace many things that you do not need to replace. I would get a second opinion before letting them touch it.",1.8
20,"April 04, 2016","The most pleasurable experience we've ever had buying a vehicle! We went by College Station Ford to look.at a truck that my husband had previously talked to James Souter about by phone. James was not only genuinely nice, but no-nonsense when it came to meeting our needs. That easy! How it should always be! Dudley made financing easy & understandable too! We drove away in our new truck! We will go out of our way to buy from James & recommend him to everyone looking for an , easy, pleasant, car-buying experience. ",5.0
21,"March 12, 2016","Thank you so very much for the kind, professional, and caring manner in which I was treated today. Away from my home in NC it was with dread and worry that I called to explain the issue with sounds on the right hand side of my Escape when turning. Jerry, the service manager responded with an affirmative attitude to bring the car in and he would check on the issues. Quickly and thoroughly an assessment was made!! The issue a small one with much noise and was resolved. SOON, my sister and I were happily sent on our way. THANK YOU for taking the time and care to make my drive home easier. If I lived in Texas my 4th Escape would be purchased from College Ford and serviced by your department - as you have gained a VERY satisfied customer. The whole service department to include Cindy, David, Jerry worked as a team to resolve and issue that had me afraid to return home, dreading the cost of the repairs, and worried about where to stay. College Ford's Service Department on March 12th 2016 took time to alleviate my fears and remove the worry with respect to the 20 hour drive back to NC. I do wish more service departments would remember the fear that many of us face with car issues that seem overwhelming when one is traveling. It would have been so easy to take advantage of me and instead I was respected and received excellent assessment and information. ",5.0
22,"February 26, 2016"," I want to thank Jerry Buck for the excellent service he provided me today.  I had a squeak and we rode around until we got the problem solved.  Very friendly and helpful, Thanks again for helping me and your patience for correcting the problem.",5.0
23,"February 26, 2016","I would like to express gratitude for the professionalism in which your Service Manager, Mr. Jerry Buck exhibited.

25,"December 26, 2015","Wrong price, feels like a marketing gimmick. I was searching their inventory on their website and found a great deal. I did the Live Chat on the website to see if the truck was still available to be told it was as long as there was not a pending sale on it. I drove up the next morning to buy the truck only to be informed that the price was wrong. I was told this has happened in the past. It felt like a marketing gimmick to get customers in. Very dissatisfied! ",1.0
26,"December 10, 2015","Went in for a regular oil change and tire rotation. The lady at the counter was very nice and helped me set everything up . She said it would be awhile so i called my friend to pick me up because i didnt want to wait. So 3 hrs go by and i get a call saying we really need to talk about your car. She said my waterpump was leaking, i was like ok it happens the car is almost 10 years old how much am i looking at. Thatll be 812.00 i was shocked i refused the service and went to a different mechanic immediately. Water pump ......No LEAK. Now if i was well off and i had droped my car off and they told me that i would be like ok and not even think twice about it and i had daddys cedit card. i know my waterpump cost around 95 so where does 600 plus come from . i know labor and coolant but 800 dollars worth? NO NO NO NO ",3.0
27,"September 29, 2015",Can't thank CINDY Parker enough for her help yesterday in the service department. As a fully commissioned sales rep time out of my car is stressful. CINDY was cognizent of this and made sure my car was taken care of quickly so I could get back on the road.  Appreciate the fact that she took the time to listen,5.0
28,"July 11, 2015","This is, by far, the worst service center I've ever had to deal with. The customer service in sales is also non-existent. I purchased a brand new truck and the salesman said he would follow up with me but I never heard from him after the purchase. They don't even put your license plates on anymore. I discovered that the volume/tuner knobs don't work and trying to get it checked out in service has become the biggest PITA I've ever experienced. They wanted me to leave it during the week and take a shuttle to and from work, but I told him I can't do that and he acted like he was offended. I shouldn't have to be inconvenienced when I purchased a $50,000 vehicle!!  I dropped it off 2 weeks later because the old man told me to come in and get there as early as possible, so on the next available Saturday I walked in at 7:50 am and they said they didn't have an appt for me. Talk about livid!  They almost turned me away until the guy running service said he remembered me coming in before and said it wouldn't be a problem. That guy is the only one who gives a rat's behind about anything over there. I have yet to receive a call that it's ready to be picked up, and I'm sure this saga is not over. This is the last time I will purchase a vehicle from this Ford. Not to mention I've bought 3 cars from them in the past 3 years. Every time my husband has a problem with his 1 year old mustang, it's conveniently not covered under warranty. I've never been treated this way by any other car dealership and I've purchased many vehicles from many different dealerships. Stay away from this place at all costs!",1.4
29,"May 27, 2015",I'd strongly recommend checking out dealerships in larger cities as this dealership marks-up vehicles far above average what other dealerships will charge. I do not like being taken advantage of.,2.4
30,"May 05, 2015","The sales were extremely rude. Tried to rip off real hard by providing false information about promotional offers. The direct manager is also extremely unfriendly. The whole process is taking forever, it took them even for pulling out simple vehicle information. It is the worst experience I have ever had. Never want to go back to that place.",1.2
31,"April 16, 2015","Thanks to Kenneth Robinson for making the car purchase process fun, in spite of the necessary steps.  It was our first time as Ford buyers, so it could have gone in the wrong direction so very quickly.

32,"March 30, 2015",I received the must appreciate service anyone could ask for. Cindy Parker is the best service writer College Station Ford has probably ever seen. She was well awhile of my needs by asking questions and getting to know my vehicle and I. My F-150 will definitely be back in for service. Companies around the world succeeded due to the employees they have. I was a completely satisfied customers and will return in no time. ,5.0
33,"March 24, 2015","Chris Levesque at College Station Ford was extremely professional and honest in his dealing with my father to buy a new truck. I would highly recommend this dealership, especially Chris as a dealer. Thanks very much for a painless purchasing experience! :+)",5.0

35,"February 22, 2014","Travelled 80 miles to see a great deal on a used car. Talked to them before we left to make sure it was still available and made an appointment to see it. Salesman called 45 minutes before our appointment to confirm we were coming.   Got there a few minutes early and were kept waiting because salesman found out car had sold 30 minutes earlier. They apologized profusely and filled our gas tank for us. They searched with all their resources for a comparable car that they could get from another dealer.  Friendly but the dealership lacked organizational skill and communication skills to keep track of their business. I would give them another look if I lived nearby, but would not drive again to their dealership.",3.8
36,"January 04, 2011","An unbeliveably negative experience with the management of this dealership.
I was looking for and found a Ford Edge at Varsity.  The salesman and his immediate supervisor were fine.  We made a deal and I wrote a check for the vehicle.  It was late in the day so there was no time to prep the car the day I bought it so my wife picked it up the next morning.

She drove the car about 10 miles to our home and was in the driveway getting familiar with the electronic devices when a ""Low Engine Oil Pressure"" warning came on and the engine shut off.  She asked me about this and I checked it out and after starting the engine again, the same thing happened a second time.

I called the salesman and told him we were bringing the car back in to be checked out.

The maintenance department found that the car had a bad electronic module and said that they would wipe the module clean and reload the necessary data.  The salesman called me later to say that the technicians were having trouble and that the module would not accept the data.  I was also told that Ford corporate had told them that cars built before December 3 2010 had a bad module and thatthey would order a new module and install in in the car I had purchased. 

I told the salesman that I was becoming very uncomfortable with this car. The car had been driven 10 miles when these problem started.  This deal was turning sour in a hurry.  I confirmed with the salesman that the car had not yet been titled in my name and told him that I wanted to return the car and start over from scratch.  I discussed the possibility of finding a similiar car built after the 3d of December to replace the original car that were were dealing with. i also said that I needed some assurance that the new car would have a ""good module"".

The salesman and his supervisor agreed to take back the car and that the deal was off.  We also agreed to discuss a replacement vehicle later, after the Christmas holiday.

The following week I got a call from the sales manager, Josh Cutler, who clearly had a attitude.  He stated that before returning the money I'd payed for the car that he'd need proof that my check had cleared my bank.  He was clearly unhappy that his sales staff had accepted the car back.  We had a rather terse conversation.

His call was followed by a call from the general manager of Varsity.  Another clear attitude and a terse conversation, although less so than the conversation with Josh Cutler.

Remember, I had paid cash for a car and had told them that I wanted them to find a second car build after December 3.  

Both Cutler and Shelton told me that they didn't want to look for another car and that they were perfectly OK with me going to another dealership.  

I suspect that one of two things happened.  Either the management was unhappy with the price the sales staff had agreed to with me... and they thought they could sell the car for more, or, they didn't like the fact that the sales staff didn't refuse to take the car back when I told them that's what I wanted to do.

Either way, the sales manager and general manager clearly demonstrated that they didn't want my business.  

All this worked out very well in the end.  I went 20 miles south to Navasota, Texas and bought the a Ford Edge, same model, same color, with a few more options for essentially the same price.

Since the bad experience with Varsity I have talked with co-workers who have also had bad experiences with Varsity.  The typical comments was: ""I wish I'd known you were talking to Varsity.  I would have told you to go somewhere else.""
