1,"January 17, 2020",Hi offer to buy my truck. Hi said I'll have a check  for you on Monday. Hi never came out of a meeting and never called me back.,1.0
2,"May 28, 2019",Went to Charlie Clark's to trade in my truck and hopefully qualify for a new one. I am a disabled veteran so my credit is not perfect but I had someone who would co-sign for me if I needed to. Well they ran my credit and indeed I needed a co-signer so I cleared it with the person who offered and they said no problem. Now co-signing and co owing are two different things. Well they led me to believe that was the case. So After they lied to me they lied to the person who offered to sign for me and did so as they were signing the papers. So now I am paying for a truck that is not mine and the person who signed for me is the owner and their credit was hit hard because we did not out right buy the truck. On top of that I am disabled and will now have to spend money on a truck that is not mine so I can get in and out without any problem. Was my first time to get a new vehicle and it was ruined for me. Do not sign anything unless you are 100% sure you know what your getting into. They swindled me and the person who signed for me and did not even try to cover it up. My advice do not shop at any Charles Clark's because they do not have any respect for those who served this country. My Name is John H.,2.0

6,"October 08, 2018","By far the best experience I've ever had purchasing a new car. Mr.Galan made things extremely easy to understand from beginning to end. No tricks, no lying; they will bend over backwards for you and do everything possible to help you with any situation. They always keep your best interest in mind and will help you as much as they can to get you what you want. They can expect by business for years to come along with that of my family. ",5.0

13,"September 27, 2018","Arrived at the dealership and was greeted by Mr. Julio Ruiz, he showed me several Frontier models and we test drove the ""midnight"" edition model.

14,"September 24, 2018","Julio RUIZ is very professional, courteous with an excellent attitude on providing the best customer service with a smile.  Mr. RUIZ was patient and informative on educating us on the vehicle accessories and size for our family. He explained a V8 engine verses a V6 engine. We chose a v6 engine 4.0, rims and running boards which was the perfect vehicle for my family of 4 as well as driving one hour to work on a daily basis. I am extremely happy with the vehicle and the customer service  I received from Mr RUIZ. He is truly an asset to your team, his patience, courtesy, and excellent attitude is a true factor why we purchased this vehicle from Mr. Ruiz from Charlie Clark dealership.  Thank you, Jose Martin Cano",5.0

19,"September 04, 2018","This is the most shady, unprofessional, rude and down right bully infested place I‚Äôve ever been at. 
They lie about everything 
I was told they were going to give me $12,000 for my trade in car and I‚Äôm the contract they put 2,000 only. This was a 2016 Jeep Patriot sport se with 19,000 miles on it!  I was told the car has specific features that i asked for in the beginning and it didn‚Äôt. 
They ignored me or my requests to return the new car and hid my trade in out of sight. 
When I said I was not taking the car because I didn‚Äôt want it not more than 30 minutes after I signed I was told that ‚ÄúI was f@$&ed and should just take the new car‚Äù. When I refused they towed the new car to my apartment and left it there. 
Also tried to get me to take the car by offering water park tickets!!!!! 
They are Liars and thieves! 
DO NOT EVEN  CONSODER PURCHASING A CAR WITH THESE PEOPLE THEY WILL CHEAT YOU OUT PF YOUR MONEY WITH NTO REMORSE WHATSOEVER. ",1.0

23,"November 18, 2015",Spoke to service dept. Manager in person while i was picking up some parts for xterra asked to see if there was a recall and there was service manager asked one of his employees to see if the part was in stock because i wanted to make sure it eould be when choosing my appointment date he said it was in stock. Went for my appointment taking a day off and found out the part was not in stock and that the procedure was to take it first then part gets ordered. By then i was sooo confused and angry because it had been the service department manager that had taken care of me and his employee told me he manges them but that he does not know procedure basically puts out fires from pissed off customers.so now I have to take the vehicle on my day off a saturday and take care of this issue again.,3.2
