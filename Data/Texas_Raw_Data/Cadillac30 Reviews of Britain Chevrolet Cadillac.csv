0,"May 30, 2020","Sold me a brand new never titled camaro zl1 m6 convertible with touch up paint and a door ding.Follow up has been awful. 

Emailed Liz Bowman as soon as I noticed and heard nothing. I left  a google review and got a vague we’re sorry call us.

Sales manager emailed me asking for previous email and photos a month ago. Still heard nothing so I escalated and went to Chevrolet.

$62k sports car with a ding and touch up paint. I only noticed excessive swirl/buff marks when on the lot and nit the door ding so it was obvious this was done to pass on to someone unsuspecting.

They will have you leave a Facebook or google review on the spot and don’t really care about your needs. Don’t be fooled by their google reviews as they’re coerced on site before you even get your keys to leave.",1.0
1,"December 29, 2019","***UPDATE*** Had a face to face meeting with the General Manager at Britain Chevrolet. He was polite, seemed to listen to what I was explaining and states he will see what they can do to make this right for my husband and I. He or Jimmy Ferguson will contact me. To be continued.

My husband and I have been huge fans of Britain Chevrolet, until now.
How can they expect repeat customers to keep coming back when they just dont concern themselves when there is a problem. Either they lead a blind eye to it, ignore it or just brush you away when you disagree with them. So...here we go nearly 6 weeks of having our car in their shop. With a problem that we have had with the car since day two of ownership.  34+ calls, repeated trips to the service department, face to face meetings with Eric, Tracey and Jimmy over the issues yet because they could not recreate the issue at any time when its been in their care (until two weeks ago), the check engine light has been on since 2013, the instrument panel flashed on and off so we never knew how fast we were going, or if we were out of gas or, or, OR. As well as to have a air conditioning system that consistently came on hot and ran heat more than a/c, only to be told by our wizard of a salesman Richard that we didnt know how to turn the a/c on?! Really?

High mileage due to my medical condition and traveling back and forth to Dallas for care, countless hospital visits and doctors visits. 

After having this car since 2013 and continuous complaints about it, the car died. The lights on the dash board shut down as well as everything else. A flatbed tow 37 miles to get the car to Britain only to be told, its probably the battery, thats where we will start. Almost four weeks later, the battery and some form of cable had been replaced and we were called that the car was back to running, come and get it, thhough not cheaply as it would cost us just under 600.00. Not a easy task to have such freedom of cash when you are on social security and on expensive medications for Parkinsons, COPD among a few. We start out to go pick up the car, and recieve a call fro Eric to hold up, he was warming our car up for us and when he went to shut it off, he looked at our dashboard and OH MY GOSH, it WAS flashing. Just as we had been stating for 6 years. A part had to be ordered to fix our cluster panel and when I asked about assistance with this since its been our problem ever since purchasing the car, Eric said he would talk with Jimmy the Service Manager and see what could be done as it would probably involve calling on GM to give us a break and allow it to be covered under our warranty from back then. Less then a day later, Eric calls and gives us the bad news. Jimmy called GM, they told Jimmy that because the car has high mileage, they would not honor the warranty. But, Jimmy was willing to give us a 200.00 discount. By now the bill is over $1000.00. And Im sorry, but, damnit, this is stuff that SHOULD have been taken seriously 6 years ago when we started this complaint, as it even shows on some of their service paperwork. But yet GM without knowing the circumstances of this issue or the 6 year background of this, make a off the hip decision that costs money we dont have. Then to have Jimmy call and inform us that we need to get their loaner car back to them as the lady in charge of the loaners has noticed that we have a lot of miles on their car and other customers who need service could sure use a loaner car. The loaner goes back tomorrow, we get our car back and Im not budging on this as it is truly unfair. We have tried calling the General Manager, Mr. Baldridge, he is in a meeting 3 times now, he doesnt accept calls? Ive left messages, spoke to the receptionists and explained our issue per her request,  asking for a call back, being reassured that he would call right back. Hasnt happened. Emailed him, asking him to contact us, Has not happened. Eric from service is on vacation, Tracey no longer works there (sadly, as she truly was a wonderful lady) and Jimmy makes me feel like a idiot because we just could not jump through hoops quick enough like they can and a car has high mileage.

I have read all of the reviews, yep we were ones who raved over the care we recieved until we have a issue and are treated like we dont matter. There isnt a button for reviews low enough on the chain to explain how poorly this has been handled, or the lack of handling on Britains part. Id like to ask for the phone number and the name of the person Jimmy spoke with at GM, as I want to hear from them how the issue for not helping us is our high mileage.

I do not feel I am being unfair to Britain Chevrolet. I believe Eric did all he could do to help us, and I will forever be grateful for his guidance and patience, same is for Tracey. But to be told that we are responsible for paying for something that has plagued our car since day 2, Is very poor customer relations on the part of the dealership, as well as the fact that there is a General Manager who cant even take some time to respond to a issue. If a person cant even connect with their customer to try and work out the issue then perhaps its time to find another job in customer service where youd get treated the way youve treated your customers, I hear McDonalds is hiring smiling faces.

Heartbreaking to say the least.",1.4
2,"June 21, 2013","ive been looking for a 2012-2013 Camaro zl1 to buy. we looked all over the nation for a car, and by chance saw a 2013 zl1 brand new at britain chevy for less than many  used 2012 zl1s.i called and talked with both scott and jeff, they were able to answer all my questions and help me finalize my purchase. I would highly recommend using this dealership, and when you do, look up these two great guys.",5.0
3,"June 17, 2013",They were EXTREMELY unprofessional. I took my car up there(which was running at the time) because it was having starting problems. They called me the next day and said it would cost me almost 600 dollars to fix it because the Mass Air Flow Sensor and the Throttle Cable had to be replaced. The Throttle cable was fine when I went up there but as I went back I noticed it had obviously cut or tampered with. When I asked the manager about this he called me a liar and told me to never come back. I will NEVER go back and suggest you don't go as well. Words cannot explain my frustration. ,1.0

8,"February 03, 2012","I felt like Scott and Kevin were being quite honest with me. I also felt they were looking out for my interests instead of just trying to make a sale. I didn't feel pressured at any time from looking to signing the paperwork.

9,"January 18, 2012",Great group of people to work with. One of my most enjoyable vehicle purchases ever. Scott and David provided us with their expert opinions on some of the used vehicles that my wife test drove. After several test drives-we drove away with a vehicle that met our needs and her wishs. ,5.0

11,"December 11, 2011","After buying a used car from Kevin for our son, we bought a new car for us the next week.  Kevin was such a joy to work with both times.  While dealing with him on the first car, he told us about a new car that met our desires.  My husband has always been a Corvette lover and could not pass up the deal that Kevin offered for the new Grand Sport.  The second sale went as smoothly as the first.  Once again, Sarah made payment an easy process.  Monte delivered it to our house and spent several hours explaining all of the bells and whistles.  We had a great experience with all with whom we dealt.  The next time that we are in the market for a car, we will certainly call Kevin again.",5.0
12,"December 11, 2011","We contacted Kevin regarding an internet listing for our son.  The deal was excellent with smooth handling. Kevin was very helpful in finding the right car to fit our criteria. Everything was done to insure our satisfaction and make the deal as convenient for us as possible.  We could not have asked for more. In fact, we ended up buying another car from him the next week. Sarah made financing an easy process for our son and us.  Monte gave great service when delivering the car to our residence.",5.0
13,"October 31, 2011","In one word - awesome!!!  I felt like I was going back in time when I arrived there.  I worked with Byron and Misty and they were the best.  They listened to what I wanted and worked to get it.  Instead of trying to convince me I needed ""extras"" they did not up-sell me at all.
It has been intimidating for me to go to a dealership in the past as a single female, but this was just the opposite.  The prices they quoted me were very fair (I shopped around before going to Britain) and their attitude was just one of 'service' instead of what they could get out of me.  Thanks Byron and Misty for a great experience.  I will see ya'll again in a few years.",5.0
14,"October 15, 2011",Each time I have either purchased or called with a question they have always gone above and beyond to meet my needs. I feel that I never have to question their integrity or desire to put me first. I am treated the same wheather I am making a New Purchase or Used. Thank You Britain Chevrolet.,5.0
15,"October 09, 2011","My husband took  me here after a long day.  I was not planning on buying a car that night. Well, we bought a car.  I will have to say that buying a car at Britain - was one of the most pleasant car buying experiences that I have ever had.  Friendly staff - stayed late for us since I was coming from Plano.   I would highly recommend this dealer.

16,"September 10, 2011","Well, I hate going ot a dealer ship that seems like there forcing everything down your throat like a sick calf the moment you walk in the door. I got the exact opposite treatment at Britain Chevrolet, they started by listening to me and what I wanted which meant everyrthing. They were extremely helpful,attentive, & fullfilling to my needs. All & all a good experience so far. It was easy, I found a vehicle on the internet, I called them and talked to Scott who very helpful in scheduling a test drive and very professional through the sale. ",4.8
17,"August 30, 2011","these guys really went the extra mile to get us into a car.  the pricing was very competitive.  very honest approach.  very pleased, i recommend this dealership to others.",5.0
18,"August 25, 2011","Have never been treated so nice.  Didn't have to go thru four or five people to buy
a vehicle.  All employees have a very positive attitude about helping their customers.  Other dealers need to visit this dealership to learn how to treat their
customers in making a car deal, it doesn't take all day to buy a vehicle.  This is the first dealership that I have been to that I didn't get totally upset with the
dealership trying to drag out the deal so that your will concede to there deal. I
wasn't told that the deal was only good for today only and that I had to buy today.
I will never return to the Greenville or Bonham Chrysler dealership because you 
almost have to fight your way out if you don't buy that day. They do a very good job
of insulting a persons knowledge about a vehicle.  Britain Chevrolet is the most positive, respectful, caring and accommadating group that I have any dealings with
over the past twenty years.  Bryan Britain has taken this dealership and made an
180 degree turn around from the previous owners.  It was a complete pleasure to do
buisness with them.  It was so great that I talked my sister into buying a vehicle
from Britain Chev. the day after we purchased ours.  She had the same fillings that
I had about the prior owners.

It was a total pleasure to purchase a vehicle from Britain Chevrolet and I will buy
my next one there also.    John M. Little  903-455-0383 Greenville Tx 75402",5.0
19,"July 20, 2011","The sale consultant was friendly and very knowlegable, he explained everything in detail and made the buying experiance very enjoyable. Sarah in finace was very knowlegable and explained everything in detail so we where made to feel very comfortable, she made sure we understood everything before we sighned our paper work. I would recomend this dealership to family and friends.",5.0
20,"July 16, 2011","I know I answered ""Great"" for everything, but it's true!!
My husband, Lynn, and I were absolutely amazed and humbled by the people at Britain Chevrolet treating
us so well...like we were actually important.  The finance guy was a bit quick, but you never know what's going on - maybe he had a sick child at home.  Anyway, it wasn't enough to keep our opinion of BRITAIN Chevrolet any less than ""GREAT"".  

We had just bought a truck from Britain, when my husband was the victim in an accident which totaled it - about a month after our purchase.

My husband & I were at our friend's place of business the next day or 2 when Lynn mentioned calling Britain back to see if we could get ANOTHER great deal from them.  Our friend said, ""You'll never get as good a deal as you got with that white truck...""
I said, ""Lynn, call 'em.""
Sure enough they had a good deal, alright!!! A newer and bigger truck with more bells & whistles.  They had just received it as a trade!! They drove the truck TO US!  When that big monster rolled up, I almost couldn't stand myself!  I thought, ""They're going to try to hammer us on this...""  Boy, was I wrong!!

Britain was JUST as great as they had been the time before & they were genuinely concerned about Lynn's health and well-being after the accident.  

God bless the people and OWNER, CEO of Britain Chevrolet. You all run a VERY nice & friendly business which is a breath of fresh air these days.  

Thank you for making our experience a smooth one.

21,"July 04, 2011","We bought an Aveo through Scott Monroe, who was courteous, honest and very polite.  Scott answered all of our questions concerning onstar.  David worked with us to keep our business and they all really made an extra effort to sell us this car.  Michael was very upfront and friendly while conducting business with paperwork.  Mr. Ferguson, in the shop, was courteous and helpful.  We will likely return.",5.0
22,"April 27, 2011","This was a courtesy delivery on a lease car. I have picked up many cars over the years, this is the first time a dealership has taken the time to go over the specifics of a car with me. Scott was very detailed and treated me as though he had sold me the car. The information was very helpful and I appreciated his time. I will consider Brittain when I am ready to purchase my retirement car.  Dianne Maddry",5.0
23,"April 06, 2011","Very helpful, very efficient!  David & Scott were both great to work with.  Thanks for your help & my new car!  The dealership was also willing to negotiate in price for the vehicle & were very fair on my trade-in value.  This dealership is focused on making everyone a lifelong customer--thanks!",5.0
24,"March 27, 2011","I chose this dealership that was over an hour from my home because I wanted hometown professional courtesy.  That is exactly what I received.  I did make it easy, I chose the car before it ever arrived to the dealership from the Chervrolet website.  They were fair and honest on my trade in.  The definition of a good deal is when both parties are comfortable with the end results.  I got a heck of a good deal.  You have to drive to the country to get treated right by the sales manager and get a hand shake from the owner.
I will make that hour drive for every oil change and service.  ",5.0
25,"March 20, 2011","Had a GREAT experience purchasing a car from the Britains. We have 4 kids and not much extra when it comes to $. We told Byron what we needed and he went over and above. Since he can purchase from anywhere in the nation he found us a Yukon XL in California. he had it brought to Texas, inspected the vehicle, let us check it out, etc. We purchased the truck. It has been excellent for our family. It was a completely hassel free experience. Our family will always buy from them. ",5.0
26,"March 20, 2011","the service department at this dealership was the friendliest and most willing to help of any i have ever experienced. they stopped what they were doing, listened to me & did not act like i was an interruption. the screws that held the opening of my gas tank in place had fallen out- so the cap was not screwing in properly. of course, i had all four of my kids in the car with me. they had me pull in immediately & fixed it in less than 5 min. i know that anywhere else they would have had me make an appointment, get my kids out and charged me for labor. this service department worked FOR me and wanted to make this as easy as possible for ME. it was also very clean.

27,"March 18, 2011","No haggle pricing. Paperwork was easy and worry-free.  Even let me take paperwork home to get husband to sign.  From start to finish, the Britains made me feel at home and made the whole transaction comfortable.  The price they quoted was the price they gave me.",5.0
28,"October 28, 2010","Great experience, I will definatly buy from them again and refer my friends and family. No pressure and super easy to work with. The guys at Britain also have a great service department with convienent hours. I bring all of my cars there for service.",5.0
29,"May 24, 2010","Bought a chevy vehicle from dealer on Friday evening 5/21, signed paper confirming deal after I corrected the first deal he made for the wrong trade difference, which would have been to my advantage, and agreed to pick up vehicle and bring title to my trade on Monday after getting title out of Safety deposit box. That was fine with salesman. I was called Sat. 5/22 at work and told I needed to come in on sat to finish deal since owner wasn't happy with deal that salesman made. I told them I was at work and had a child graduating that day but I would try to come eventhough I would not have title to my vehicle. I called them at 2pm on sat and told them I was on the way but to please have my papers ready since I was in a hurry due to graduation.  I was not told of any problems at that time.  I arrived at the dealership at 2:30 and noticed my car was no where to be found.  I entered the dealership and finally met by the salesman who closed my deal.  Upon entering his office he made out like he couldn't find my paperwork and went to front desk saying they had it up there.  He never returned but the sales manager ( John) came in and informed me that they had sold my vehicle before I got there.  He accused me of not closing the deal eventhough I signed there deal paper.  Conversation got heated as I instructed them that this was a poor way to transact business and he informed me he would call cops if I were not quite so that the other customers couldn't here what they had done.  I informed him to call away.  I called back onthe way home to speak with owner and he refused to speak with me or return my call.  I recommend that you go somewhere else to purchase your vehicle, these people are liars",1.8
