13,"October 31, 2018","3 weeks ago today, I had my Dodge Charger towed to Mike Smith Dodge when the Transmission control module went out, the car is still covered under Dodges Powertrain warranty.  I have left many many voicemails and have not received one call back, I have emailed and haven’t received a response. Left voicemails with not only the Service Manager Mr Williams but also with the general manager of this location, again neither called back. When they don’t “drop my call” during hold times waiting to speak with someone, they tell me my car has been pushed back due to high volumes of customers. I’ve asked for a loaner car while I’m waiting for my car to be serviced and was denied, and told that the labor hours to fix my car (4 hours) didn’t qualify me for a loaner. I explained to them I was out of town when my car broke down and I live an hour and a half away, and this is my only means of transportation.  When I was able to get a ride to this location, I was told I could wait and try to speak with a manager but they probably weren’t going to see me that day. After I spent some time waiting, I decided to leave.  I am still waiting for a call back. 3 weeks later, still without a vehicle and no one can tell me when they will even look at my car for repairs. I am frustrated, angry, and at a loss at this time, I write this review because I wouldn’t want another person to have to be in such a situation that he/she is literally stranded with no vehicle due to poor management and/poor customer care.

32,"September 15, 2016", Mike Smith employees sold my son a jeep with a lie just to make a sale! I let everyone know don't go there!!!!! My son went there to buy a jeep they said they had to put it in my name for 3 months and that they spoke with associate at my bank and she would refinance it in his name after three months. The next day I call the associate up little did he know I knew her she said he lied she never spoke to him or anyone for me and my son. Now the jeep is in my name and my son pays for his jeep. My bank tells me this is fraud! I rated this company a 1 only because the overall rating had to be filled to complete this review. Let me now tell the BBB about this..,1.0
33,"June 09, 2016","My salesman, Richard Gipson, was outstanding. Mike Smith is great, and thanks to your company's extraordinary salesperson I'll be a customer for life",5.0
34,"May 27, 2016","I purchased a 16 Oscar Mike. Wasn't too impressed with the sales managers, but I bought it here. Added some after market tires. The left wheel fell off of the vehicle and I interfaced with Keith Leget, the general manager.
His actions were in general melon mouthed and an attempt to baffle me with his intellect. He had no idea of how or why the rim fell off. I am a 100% DAV as well as waiting on a heart transplant and in no way could I even manage to get the spare off, much less change one that had fallen off.
Anyone dealing with aluminum mags, all the way up to the manufacturer will tell you to double torque a mag.
Every one has bad days, but good people are accountable for their responsibilities.
Except for Mr. Leget.
I went in straight up wanting to resolve this easy and clean.
Wasn't about to happen with these people. So I had my Jeep towed to Mid County and they adopted me like family. At the time, I was spending a week in the hospital with heart problems and Mid County did ALL of the leg work Mike Smith should have done.
And more.
I am grateful for Mid County Jeep and reserve the utmost contempt for Mike Smith Jeep As well as their general management..",1.4
35,"January 20, 2016","I have a 2013 Chrysler 300, on December 23, 2015 my car broke down. I had a tow truck to bring it to Mike Smith, a week later, I get my car back, and it broke down again, they told me they changed the shift. They kept it from Friday until Tuesday; it broke down the same day. They told me they changed valve body. These were supposed to be the diagnosis after the diagnostic check was done. The next day I take it to Cecil Atkinson in Orange, Texas, they do the diagnostic check, and it was 2 abs sensors. It took about 45 minutes to fix. Now my car runs fine.",1.0
36,"October 16, 2014","I went to this dealership because I seen a vehicle I liked and was interested in purchasing. The agent that attended me when I came in was Shawn Gilstrap. I pointed out what vehicle I liked and he said that they'll make it workout. He said he would give me a phone call the next morning to informed me what he was able to workout. So I waited all day and he never called. I called him that evening so he said I needed a co-signer for being a first time buyer, which I perfectly understand BUT he assured me if a co-signer with good credit signed we would be able to make a deal. So I brought the co-signer to him and everything was approved. The problem was that he brought me a vehicle that wasn't what I had pointed out and they still had it there. So I told him I didn't like the one he offered(dodge) I wanted the GMC.  He completely igignored my request and brought another different vehicle once again I said no. At that point he got really really mad he walked off on me and didn't spoke to me at all again.  That was very rude. Not recommended. ",1.0
37,"January 03, 2014",Mr. Gipson was AMAZING! He worked with me until he found the best car suitable for my family and I. I would Definitely would recommend him and the company to ANYONE! ,5.0
38,"April 30, 2009","I'm sad for Mr. Gipson, our salesman, for having to deal with his immensely inadequate superiors to make his living.  Richard did his job fine and his superiors failed miserably. They wasted two weeks of my time, cost me points on my credit for running it so much, and hung up on my wife when she didn't want to accept a vehicle physically ""close"" to them. I was pretty much told, ""We aren't going to go through that much trouble to locate you a jeep.""  They told me I needed to spend my $30,000 on a Jeep that was local and ""close"" to what I wanted.  It was obvious that the only reason I was posing problems for them was because they didn't understand how to do their job.  I purchased the exact same vehicle I wanted two days later from Allen Samuels Chrysler Jeep (a different dealer in same county) without any problems. ",1.0
