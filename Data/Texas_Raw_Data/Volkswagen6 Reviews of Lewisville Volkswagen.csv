0,"June 24, 2020","Let the buyer beware! After purchasing multiple VWs from this dealer, I was promised their help in solving a misunderstanding between their finance manager, Lee Nolen, and VW Credit regarding an early lease termination. Even though the problem had supposedly ""been resolved"" I got a bill from VW Credit almost a year later for an extra $1000. (I finally paid it just to keep from ruining my credit). The dealer was no help at all. I couldn't get the time of day from them after three months of messages left and in-person visits (Don't worry, we're working on it and will get back to you...""). Owner Bobby Beck and Sales Manager John Chapman do not deserve your trust or your business. ",1.0
1,"March 11, 2019","Having purchased many new cars in the past, I did my research, requested quotes from everyone in the DFW metroplex, fielded the onslaught of emails, texts and calls. 
We started out at another dealership thought to have the best variety and prices due to size, volume and claims to meet our specific needs. Fortunately, we stayed in touch with several as we negotiated and Leo Sangiovanni at Lewisville Volkswagen gave us the absolute best price hands down. The Jetta we ended up with was an upgrade from what we were expecting on price and couldn't or wouldn't be touched by others offering on theirs. He was 110% honest and upfront with total cost to drive out and played no games. After the back and forth exercise of negotiating with salesman and management in Frisco for six hours,  I can only say it was a relief not unlike having survived a moderate disaster.
I have no reservations about recommending you call and ask for Leo on your next new purchase of a Volkswagen. 
She'll be using the lifetime free hand car washes frequently as she's very proud of her new car.",5.0

Got a very negative experience buying a 2013 Jetta in September. The Jetta is okay but the way they conducted the deal is not okay at all.
Low customer ethics. New management will do what's right for Lewisville VW and not what is right for you as customer. 
If you against all odds go anyway as they have something you want.... CAREFULLY watch out for any add-on as so-called ""protection package"". Fast sales smart talking making you think it’s okay for your own good but it's not. Scam, it's totally worthless and a way for them to make extra $895-$2,000.  Make sure they explain exactly the $$ details of the initial sales quote and not only focus on the monthly payment, you get totally blindsided and lured away from the actual charges, insist in getting a copy of the sales quote (as they shady hide it from you after you signed it) and make sure you bring it in to final signing so you know/remember where the deal started from, be patient and CHALLENGE each line. 
I have bought five VW's over the years from Lewisville VW, and this deal was a very bad experience.  My perception as customer is highly negative. Thought it was like previous years under old management, which I trusted and have never been let down or taking advantage off, but it's not at all near to previous business and customer care standards.  
It SUCKS – It hurts, it’s sad.... With their lag of customer finance respect, they are going down, only a matter of time till enough of us get hurt
Will never go back

3,"June 03, 2017",I recently purchased a Golf R from Lewisville Volkswagen and could not have been more impressed with the overall experience from start to finish. Landon Beck and Joe Downs were an absolute pleasure to work with and made the process easy and enjoyable. Customer service was beyond amazing! If you are looking to get a Volkswagen in the Dallas/Ft. Worth area do yourself a favor and check them out.,5.0

He was very honest and upfront about everything. I highly recommend anyone to visit, Landon Beck, at  Lewisville Volkswagen, who is in need of a new vehicle. Thanks for everything!",5.0

I would give them a 10 out of 10 , I'm 42 years old and have bought several vehicles in my life time and this was by far the fastest,  easiest  , best dealership I have been to.",5.0
