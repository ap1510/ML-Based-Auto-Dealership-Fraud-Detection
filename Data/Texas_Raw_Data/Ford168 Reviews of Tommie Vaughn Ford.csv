0,"June 22, 2020","On return and my short drive home it appears technical work performed and completed addressed the problem I was having with an occasional mis-fire of the engine.   When so many dealers (e.g. Mercedes, BMW, Hyundai, Chevrolet) are advertising the lengths they are going to, to clean and sanitize your vehicle after being serviced, Tommie Vaughn gets a bit zero in that respect as it was apparent they did nothing in that respect of the car on completing the service and returning it to me.

2,"June 12, 2020","My recent experience was a little disappointing, most of the time I have no issues. Frankly, Brenda was rude on my engagements with her. I spent $2,300 on a new evaporator core and the memory to my remote key was lost, I had to drive home 45 miles round trip to get extra key to prove it to them with no concessions. I was a little surprised, I also got no loaner car, had to rent a car for 3 days. ",3.0

6,"May 19, 2020","I am in sales myself and I really appreciate someone so GENUINE as  Lauren Evans at Tommie Vaughn Ford.  Knowledge + Integrity + the Right Amount of Intensity go along way. Everything was so relaxed and went so smoothly.  

I emailed LAUREN from their website with my interest in a 2020 Ford Explorer ST.  She responded with an email.  Then by text, we conversed about my specific areas of concern over several days.  I told her I would be in on Tuesday around noon.  I was running very late and she said no problem but to text her when I was in route so she could make sure she was not eating lunch and would be available.  At my request, Lauren provided information on available financing and rebates and based on my specific desires, she made certain recommendations that I appreciated.

 After, I bought my car, I made 2 trips back to the dealership with some stupid operational questions such as ""I remember you explaining how to use the lane watching system and the various drive modes but can you go over them again?""  

There are many Ford dealers but I will definitely return  to TV Ford for my future new cars and and highly recommend anyone buying a Ford to do so also.",5.0

15,"April 23, 2020","I have now purchased numerous vehicles at Tommie Vaughn Ford going back 20 years all with the same salesman- David Bagby. He is the best in the business, easy to talk to, personable and doesn’t give you any runaround. It’s the smoothest and most stress free truck buying experience. The dealership itself is great also. Tommie Vaughn is smaller than other Ford dealerships but have always plenty to choose from and you feel like they value your business. I wouldn’t buy a truck elsewhere period. 4 F150s and 3 F250s later I couldn’t be happier with the service. ",5.0

Megan and Cesar are very professional, knowledgeable and helpful, and the service tech who did the work on my car was as well - I'm sorry I don't know his name.  There's no reason to go anywhere else when my car needs service, and since I'm a Ford girl, I'll never go anywhere else to buy my vehicles.

31,"February 08, 2020","This area has a spectacular family-owned dealership! Never have I known that when I arrived at Tommie Vaughn with the big sign coming down pass 11th street, Shane Sullivan hooked with me up with several cars to test drive. I loved the service that he provided me, which is a different experience versus another salesperson. Shane told me about the history of the store and the ways I can get an affordable oil change + tire rotation. There are incentives when coming to this dealer, which they also have a quick service lane. It depends on the timing of when you arrive for service, but it should take no more to 30 minutes to an hour depending on how long the line is to get your car serviced. I recommend getting your vehicle serviced at this dealer instead of anywhere else. Other places are a rip off! Come to Tommie Vaugh Ford, and you'll see for yourself. Also, fun fact: Tommie Vaughn went to Texas A&M University, which most of the technicians are highly trained with a degree in mechanical parts.",4.8

39,"January 01, 2020","When we contacted the dealership on Monday after having started looking at another dealer on Saturday and could not get them to answer us on Monday, we were assigned to Lauren Evans.  We knew that at the end of the year there were rebates on the 2019s.  We had researched them on Sunday online.  So we knew what vehicle, we knew a price from the other dealership, and we knew what we thought were ""all"" the rebates available.  Lauren worked with us and found us even more.  We worked it all out by text and email, so when I walked in, we were ready to sign documents.  And, there was an additional rebate that was added from our last text to when I signed, so the vehicle was $750 lower than I thought I would be paying.  They were not hard-pressuring post agreement to add additional ""bells and whistles"".  I would contact Lauren again if I am in the market looking.  THANKS TV FORD!!!",5.0

58,"September 21, 2019"," I was coming back from Austin went Sunday afternoon and my car broke down 30 miles from home. I was able to use my Ford roadside service to have my car towed to the dealership closest to my house. It was late and the security guard was kind enough to let the tow truck driver drop my car off and she dropped my keys in the dropbox. Next morning I called right when service opened and made them aware of my vehicle. I went in also that morning and met with Josh my service advisor. He was absolutely fabulous and made sure that I fully understood what I was going to take place. Within  A matter of hours Josh called and let me know what the problem was how much it would cost tax and all and that he thought hard for me to see if it was covered under my warranty. Not only was it very reasonable he told me that he would have my car ready for me that day knowing that I did radiation every morning at MD Anderson. Josh called me at 2:30 that afternoon and let me know that my vehicle is ready for pick up. When I arrived after work my car was ready, the cashier was fabulous and I was out the door in no time. I’m very grateful for Tommie Vaughn Ford and everyone that I encountered. Unforeseen expenses are not my cup of tea  and everyone at Tommie Vaughn made this is a very easy experience.

60,"September 12, 2019","Repeated disappointments in service. My Explorer must be the lemon. Brought it in for warranty and car was not put back together in afternoon for pickup. Very expensive UBER night with soccer practice for my daughter, etc. Even thought I didn't get any work on my vehicle, BEWARE, they charged a minimum 1 hour diagnostic charge of $145 even if it only took 15 min. OVERPRICED, but I guess I expect that from them. When comparing pricing of my $2000 quote for ""services needed"" online, all their prices were at the highest end of range.  From my experience, the manager (not Randy) needs some training in customer service. The owners need to consider diagnostic times of 15 min. increments.

61,"September 05, 2019","I bought a new 2018 Ford Expedition had it a couple of months and the air conditioner went out.  Stayed in the shop 5-6 weeks get it back and within 2 days the whole floor was wet with water the air conditioner leaking.  The dealership kept it a couple of days said they fixed it and told me they cleaned the carpets YEP you guessed it a BIG Lie. We have been buying from Tommie Vaughn many years because of our salesman but I'm afraid this will  be my last Ford.  You would think being a loyal customer they would want to keep you. So to say I am disappointed is a understatement.
Sad part is if I wouldn't have bought the extra warranty I wouldn't have had a car to drive as they do not give loaners. ",1.8

We pick the vehicle up and within two hours the rear sway bar fell off.. literally.  I requested they buy the vehicle back after putting 2000 miles on it.

Well over the weekend took a short trip to Galveston and on the way back, hit something that caused the left rear tire to have a chunk taken out of it.

I had two bad experiences with two different dealerships in which they were both rushy, didn't really want to answer all of my questions and one was just rude. I believe they figured I couldn't afford the vehicle and judge to me by my looks oh, too bad so sad for them. I must add, one dealership didn't even return my call but I'm happy they didn't as my experience with Tommie Ford was amazing. My sales rep was Leonardo who reached out to me first oh, I didn't return his call and he not only answered every question that I had, he took the time to look up inventory as I did not really have time, sent pictures and specs to me by text message and found exactly what I needed especially because I was picky. By the way I did this all from another state, LOL. When I arrived in state to pick up my vehicle, I was greeted by Leonardo, Carlos which I believe is the sales manager and my other favorite Mickey the finance manager!

161,"May 03, 2016","Took my card to do a recall and air conditioner service. I picked my car.  Air was working fine. On weekend drove the car for a while then when we (my wife and 9 year old son and I) stopped at a store the car would not stooped and after a few start the car started to smoke so we towed it to the  dealership.  We ended up getting a taxi to go home. weekend was ruined. Left a message for the service adviser but did not hear back from him on Monday morning so I called myself.  I talked to another and he told me the adviser is in and he will have him to call me back.  The adviser called and said that they did get to the car.  I called in about couple of hours since I did not hear back from him.  He told me that he will get back with me when he has an update.  I mentioned it would be nice as a good customer service to get back with the customer every hour instead of customer calls back for follow up.  In the afternoon I called again and I was told by the adviser that they got to it and did not find anything and they will hold the car for one more day.  Next day again i had to call back for the follow up.  They did not find anything wrong with the car.  A few days later my wife called me to tell me that the car was smoking again. It was fortunate that she did not travel too far and was home when the car smoking with my son in the car.  I came home and noticed the car overheated and antifreeze leaked out all over.  Once again it was weekend so the car could not be looked at.  We towed the car back to the dealership.  I called and left a message for the adviser.  Same thing all over again the adviser did call me.  He called me and told me that they could not get to it for couple of days because they are backed up?? They finally got to my car and found out that the thermostat need to be replaced?? :( We did not have any issue with overheating till now?? So they went ahead ad replaced it but then they told me that the fan is not working due to wiring and relay issue which caused the car overheat again. So the the thermostat did not have to be replaced? Right. Once again they could not get to the car for couple of days because they were backed up.  All along the adviser would made hardly any follow up calls so I was hanging wondering what was going on.  Finally after a week the car was repaired.  When I got home I noticed the windshield wiper reservoir cap was missing and they charged me $30 for antifreeze fluid which cost about $3 at the store and this should have been at no charge since they caused the overheating and antifreeze liquid leaking out.  I paid over $1000 after warranty deductible for reapirs that may had not needed if they would have diagnosed properly from the beginning.  It may have needed or were caused by the technician and I paid for it all and some. One month later my wife noticed a noise and then an aroma of burning plastic.  I took the car to the dealership.  I waited for the adviser for 45 minutes to tell me that it will be couple of days before they would be able to take a look at it.  Other advisers were not busy he could have have other advisers to help me out.  I am taking my car to somewhere else.  I was so fed up with the service and the adviser's lack of knowledge and customer service.  Somebody must teach him that he needs to follow up with the customers instead of him telling the customers that he will get back when he has an update,  Another words ""Do not call me I call you"".  Now I do not know what else was done and could go wrong.  I asked for the replacement part and the only part I received was the thermostat which looked fine.  ",1.0

Mgr ( used cars ) - Talked to after the fact - David Leskowitz
VP Sales - Kirby Janke - Talked to following day
Timeline:
1. Came in  Monday 3/14 w/wife - drove used Ford Expedition - Liked - made offer and couldn't close the deal. Left dealership
2. Tuesday Morning 10:36am - 3/15 - Called Alex told him very interested and I wanted to work a deal. After a few calls back and forth, came to an agreed price.
3. I was using an outside credit union to get the loan. Got on phone with credit union and stayed in touch with  Alex through email and text as interest rate and loan was in progress.
4. At 3:14 loan was approved and the letter  was emailed to Alex regarding approval as well as the PO which was sent to me by Alex at 12:16pm for the vehicle and was emailed to credit union to fund the money to car dealership.  
5. At 3:32 I receive text from Alex that car has been sold to someone else and someone was signing them up in finance. I am furious! I request a call from mgr.
6. Mgr. - David Leskowitz calls and all he can say is I understand your frustration and I asked to speak to his superior. Says hes on vacation.....lie! His superior -  VP of Sales - Kirby Janke calls me the following day. So not on vacation! Not satisfactory as I was truly treated poorly and the car was sold out from underneath me. Horrible Business, to say the least!!! Janke says, if there is anything that I could do to make it up to you I would......guess he couldn't find anything! 

I have had many dealings with car dealerships over the years. Overall, car buying in the last 5 years has become better due to the internet and most consumers should have decent knowledge if you do any research. This creates less hassle at the dealerships in haggling. Tommie Vaughn is an Old dealership off the beat and track and still use the old style of schmuck car salesmen. I am in sales myself, have for 25 years and this was a very unprofessional display! I see other reviews here as well and know I am not the only individual in this boat with this dealership!

163,"August 21, 2015","This is the worst place to buy a car.  I took in a copy of their internet add for a car that I wanted to purchase.  When I asked for a total price to write a check they increased the price by $2300.  I've heard of a bait-and-switch, but this wasn't even a switch - it was the same car.  I left when the new car sales manager (Max Funderburk) was yelling at me in the showroom that I was trying to screw him and he wasn't going to let me.  All I asked was that they honor their advertisement.

To reward them for their efforts I have filed complaints with the Federal Trade Commission, Texas Attorney Generals office, Ford Motor Company and the Better Business Bureau.  Just to make it more interesting I have also forwarded my complaints to all of the local television consumer reporters.",1.0
164,"July 27, 2015",I brought my Ford Mustang there last Thursday and they send me home saying they are seriously behide schedule. They recommended I bring in my car early next Monday so they work on my car to fix the problem. I did bring my car early Monday morning and I called them to check the status 8 hours later. What they told me is that my car is still in the lot waiting in line to be checked. They also told me that I can come pick up my car if I can wait. I bought a Ford because it is made in USA. I will buy a Japanese car next time.,1.3
165,"June 13, 2014",I worked with Javier Cavazos on a new Fusion.  He and Max did a good job trying to find what I wanted and working with the price.  They were low pressure and let me make up my own mind.  I was NOT bombarded with emails and phone calls like some dealers.  Very enjoyable experience for me.  Their new showroom is nice as well!,4.2
166,"May 27, 2014","I began leasing a brand new car (literally, less than 500 miles) about a month ago. Driving it around Houston, the undercarriage shield fell off on the road while I was driving. $350 repair within the first month of owning a brand new car. Not to mention the member of the service team, whose name I can't remember off hand, and which I don't care to waste time looking up, was arrogant and dismissive with me. This type of thing should not happen after one month of ownership, and if it does, you would hope that the company selling the product would at least be sorry. I don't like being told I must have hit something when I did not. There was obviously a mistake putting this part on.  To top the whole experience off, the dealership cannot get the part in for a month, but that did not stop them from requiring that I pay for it immediately. It's always nice to hand someone moneyt and then get the distinct feeling that they no longer care about you at all. In any event, there are plenty of Ford dealerships out there. I don't know if others are any better,  or if screwing over your customers has truly become the new norm, but I would recommend looking at other dealerships. Unfortunately, I still have 35 months left on my lease, but this is the last automobile I will ever purchase from this company. 

Also, of note, I have had things like this go wrong in the past with other products, but this is the first review I have ever written in my life, because this experience has made me completely livid. I am not a serial complainer or poster, but this whole experience was totally unnacceptable.",1.5
167,"May 11, 2007","I love the way they do business at Tommie Vaughn.  At I searched high and low online for the best deal, and most dealers gave me the run around.  They did everything they could to get me through the front door before ever mentioning anything about price.  

Tommie Vaughn was different.  They gave me a great price upfront!!  They were willing to special order the car I wanted, at invoice, and pass all the incentives on to me.  Their only profit is the dealer holdback, which on the car I order is not much at all.  Their philosophy is any sale is a good sale.  

They will not waste your time making you jump through hoops.  If you know what you want go to Tommie Vaughn and talk to Rick Sausley.  He is a great guy, will give you a great price and is very upfront with you!!  This is my first new car ever and I'll definitely go back to Tommie Vaughn.",5.0
