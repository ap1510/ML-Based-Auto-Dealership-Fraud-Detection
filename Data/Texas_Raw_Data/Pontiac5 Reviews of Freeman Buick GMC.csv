0,"March 01, 2018","On Nov 28, 2017, I purchased a 2009 Mercedes SL63 from David Parrish at Freeman GMC Grapevine.  I found the car on Auto Trader and called the dealership to speak to a salesperson as I was located out of state.  The salesperson never returned my call, so I called again and spoke with David Parrish, the manager.  He stated that the car was in excellent condition as it had only 15K miles and was well taken care of.  I asked for videos of the interior, exterior and one of the car running.  There were three videos, 2 of which were narrated.  The salesman stated that the car was in showroom condition, with no scratches on the paint or glass.  I found out after I received the car that the windshield was scratched and one section of the driver seat which was conveniently not shown was damaged.  So, based on my conversation with David Parrish and the videos, I purchased the car.  When I received the car, I noticed that the convertible hardtop was not working properly which they should have known had the checked the car out as they say they had., the latch on the center console was broken and the manuals were missing.  I got prices to repair these items and to replace the manuals and called David Parrish.  They agreed to pay for the top and the manuals.  The next time I drove the car, the low coolant light came on, so I immediately went and had coolant added.  I drove the car twice more and the second time which was a longer trip, the low coolant light came on again along with the Check Engine Light.  I immediately stopped and called Mercedes.  I had the car towed to them.  Upon inspection, it was revealed that the engine had 2 broken head bolts and was leaking coolant into the cylinder heads.  I was told that the problem was not something that just happened and the fact that the coolant was low to begin with was probably indicative that the problem existed prior to my purchase.  I immediately notified David Parrish and told him that I would attempt to have Mercedes pay for the repair since the mileage was within warranty.  Mercedes paid for 1/2 of the repair, so I sent the bill for the other half, $2500 to David Parrish.  They informed me that they would not pay for that 1/2 of the repair.  I paid for the repair and picked the car up that night, my first time driving the car at night, and noticed that the windshield was badly scratched with fine scratches, only visible at night, contrary to their video.  I asked for that repair also and they declined.  In my opinion, there is no way that they were not aware of the problems, and that they should pay to have them repaired.  I would never purchase a car from this dealer again.  I am contemplating legal action at this time.",1.6
1,"February 18, 2018","Not one to leave bad reviews but it made me angry that i called ahead, made and appointment, drove out to the dealership, and ran my credit. Only after i ran my credit did they tell me that the listed price on auto trader was not the actual price and that there had been an error. I guess this is their tactic to bring customers in.. complete waste of a Saturday... don't waste your time with this dealership.",1.0
2,"January 26, 2018","12/19/2017 - Lost control of my car on hwy 114 due to shaking smacked concrete barrier wall @ 65 MPH.
12/4/2017 - latest & greatest update - car STILL plagued with electrical issues (approx 2 yrs. 10 visits to svc later AND still an issue)!! Shaking (approx. 7 mos 4-5 visits to svc AND still an issue)!! Heads up display (approx 4 mos 3 visits to svc later AND still an ongoing issue) was told it was the curvature of my windshield that is the reason....defective parts 2 times & they broke my control knob!!! A/C issues 5 mos & 3 svc visits later, seems fixed though it hasn""t been warm enough for me to run since picking up 11/22!  They won't stand behind the vehicles they sell nor their service!!!! Can't post pictures now since they've blocked me from posting BUT can update my revew ðŸ˜Š

Check YouTube soon will be posting video's soon of the issues and visits to their dealership..... maybe the voicemail messages with conflicting lies....I played thern for GM HQ today.

Buy your vehicle elsewhere, if not you'll be plagued with numerous visits to the service department. They sold me a car with an open recall (per Ozzie, in a coversation 2/13/17) so apparently they knew about an electrical issue and sold the car anyway!!!! When purchased I asked for a copy of the ""inspection/mechanical report"" from where they took it in on trade in,  claimed not to have one!  They didn't even provide a copy of the prior service visits, said it was fine. Actually,  it had already been in and out of the service dept. for many things,  including the driver's seat (something wasn't right couldn't figure it out until I was flipping through the prior service on my car while waiting on the cashier to finish with another couple, asked them to correct the issue with that lack of quality warranty work,  wouldn't do it and I'd have to pay about $175, for lack of quality on warranty work).  Ozzie also advised they are NOT a ""CERTIFIED"" dealer because it cost too much money to become certifie. Are you freaking serious???? It gets better,  they've had an engineer come out to diagnose my vehicle, so they've kept my SUV for some times 3 + weeks. Ozzie NOW informs me that I was only permitted to drive their loaner vehicle no more than 300 miles TOTAL each time you have one, no matter the length of time they've kept your vehicle in the Service department! NO mention at drop off of any kind of mileage limitations, only after the fact!!! So in one instance I couldn't have even driven to work daily muchless to the pharmacy to get my child's medicine, take to a doctor visit or the grocery store. For My last service dropped my vehicle off 12/15, advised I needed it back by the 20th or morning of the 21st, as we were flying out for Christmas vacation. They called a couple days later stating my SUV was ready, well guess what we're not in town & the loaner was in our garage in TEXAS.  Ozzie then insinuated I was lying about the fact we FLEW out of town, I offered copies of airline tickets, rental car receipts, car service receipt from our home to the airport and even mentioned that the PD was at my home when the car service arrived due to a theft of checks from our home by a contractor. 
So everything you visioned about a ""Blue polyester suit wearing car sales"" THIS dealership completely embodies it, in every way!!!! (Awaiting a return call from Mr. Freeman to a voice mail left 2/13/17)

In my last two visits to Freeman, I've discovered that Kim Rainbow is only part of the problem in the Service department....she's beyond rude,  she's disrespectful & thoroughly unprofessional!!!! How she treated me this evening was well over the top, not to mention how horrible her interactions are with her colleagues are! Her talking down to them muchless the disrespect she exudes in all interactions in front of your customers!!!! (I've discovered that this must be the Freeman way)

3,"July 01, 2016",My wife and I purchased our third Denali from Freeman GMC. Love the new vehicle and as always we were treated like royalty with Freeman GMC. I have had all of the service work on my last Denali taken care of by Freeman GMC.   ,5.0
4,"February 09, 2012","SCAM ARTIST! They will preach to you about how close they inspect used vehicles and they only sell the best..blah blah. I bought a vehicle and on Day 1, I had to replace a headlight, the timing belt, and ALL 4 brakes. Oh, and the response when I approached them was, ""Sorry, its as is!""... Be very careful if you look at a used car. They dont inspect anything and I would definitely not recommend this Dealership to anyone!
