1,"August 09, 2017",I have just recently purchased my very first Volvo and absolutely love it.  The dealership and their staff made everything super smooth for me. My experience was better than I could've hoped for. ,5.0
2,"February 21, 2016",My son and I have had the worst service there on 3 different occasions. They will rob you blind there and sabotage your vehicle just so you take it back to them. Horrible I tell you.,1.0
3,"February 21, 2016","Deception and lies permeate this dealership. From start to finish, the buying process was painful and frustrating. My wife finally got the car that she wanted, but on a personal note, I will never go back to this corrupt dealership. If you go, go with the full awareness that you will not enjoy the experience.",1.0
4,"July 30, 2012","I went in thinking I was going to get a great deal, but i knew it was too good to be true. After going through all the numbers we finally sat down to talk to the finance lady.Everything was going great except for the constant repeating of her&quot;are you sure, are you sure, are you you don't want to give us a couple grand for the extended warranty&quot;. Finally we started to sign the last papers until I saw the final price. almost 4000 over what we had talked about before. We thought it was an error, and asked them. Turns out they changed our price back to the MSRP. They couldn't get the dealer we talked to in the office after asking them to bring him in. She leaves and bring in the Sales Manager Joe Saldana. We sat there thinking everything was going to get fixed, nope. After we explained what happened he starts to pull out the first price which is the MSRP.  He starts talking to us as if were stupid little kids and he even had the nerve to call me mijito. I was not treated with respect and he wouldn't even hear what we had to say. All he said was &quot;Well you don't have to buy the car if you don't want to&quot;, in an upset tone. So we left. MAKE SURE YOU ASK FOR THE FINAL PRICE before they get you in the hole. Don't fall for their MSRP price either. Horrible experience in buying my second car.",1.0
5,"May 16, 2012",Very bad service after purchasing several vehicles from this dealership. When I decided to buy another vehicle they did not help me. Because of their poor attitude I went and purchased a vehicle at Frank Smith Hyundai. Now I've been at it with these two individuals to try to get my refunds for the warranties that were not used and I have been getting the run around for about 3 months. DO NOT GO TO THIS DEALERSHIP. Everything is fine and nice up until you sign. After that good luck.,1.0
6,"October 06, 2011","I took Cadillac in due to recalls and had the dealer fix an 
loud, annoying rattle noise in the back that started about a
year after buying the car. The service department called and said 
everything was fixed and ready to go. Nothing was fixed except the
recalls. Same rattles exist.

On a previous occasion I took the Cadillac in to be fixed and they
said the car would be ready the same afternoon. I went to pick up the
car the next day at noon and the car was still not finished.

Horrible dealership to do business with. Avoid Bert Odgen!",2.0
7,"June 10, 2011","Alfredo De Leon, a service representative from Bert Ogden in Edinburg TX told me that the ""stabilitrak"" light being displayed on my '07 GMC Z71 was not a problem I needed to worry about.  Later it turned out to be a serious problem that will cost me over $500 in repair work, An expense that could have been avoided had he done his job correctly in the first place.  Now I have to spend my time getting a District Specialist involved in helping me solve this problem and will eventually have to file a case at a small claims court to resolve this issue.",2.4
8,"August 02, 2010","I had the pleasure of dealing with a very helpful and knowledgeable sales consultant, Balde Silva.  Had a great experience and was shown great respect.  I look forward serviceing my vehicle with Bert Ogden and purchasing my next vehicle from Balde.  Great experience!",5.0
9,"January 21, 2009","Excellent vehicles in the showroom. All have been inspected and they stand behind their cars. I got a minivan for my wife and it has been the best.
All their personnel are friendly and ready to satisfy any customer issues.
Will definitely buy again from this dealership and recommend to my friends and Family.

10,"July 31, 2007","Bert Ogden is truly a Wonderful, Friendly. Down-Home Dealership!  I was extremely impressed with the quality of their sales and service departments.  Over the years, I have purchased numerous vehicles, yet never have I been made to feel more at home and appreciated.  The staff always curteous and helpful.  Thank you Bert Ogden for the super experience...I highly recommend Bert Ogden to everyone.  Especially since they gave me the best price in town.  
DALE GAS!
