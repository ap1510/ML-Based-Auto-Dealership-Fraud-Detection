0,"December 11, 2018","I traded in a lease vehicle as a trade with a payment for the following month. Instead of making the trade, they returned it as a lease to the lease grantor, leaving me owing the payment and miles, even though the contract was for a trade covering both, but to save themselves the wholesaler fees they cheated me and left me pending payments. After calls to their fianance department they refused to speak to me.",1.0
