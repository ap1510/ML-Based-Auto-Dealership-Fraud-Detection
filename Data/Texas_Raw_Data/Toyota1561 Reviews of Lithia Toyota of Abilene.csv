23,"May 24, 2019","3 people made my day!!! Greg Parks, Aaron Coker and Andrew Little.  Greg was there from the start not just trying to make a sale but to put a smile on my wife's face. He went as far as to give me his personal cell phone number and told me to call him anytime ( day or night ) with questions for purchasing the vehicle.  Further more he contacted Andrew Little on his cell phone so I could discuss all the ways the deal would go down. Mr Little carried on with the same standard of professionalism that Greg had given me. Answered every question with the same professionalism as Greg.  Next day I went back to Lithia to confirm the deal. Both Greg and Andrew worked with me on any finishing questions I might have. I bought the car.  Aaron is one of the most professional and organized paper man I have ever been around. He broke my questions down and explained everything associated with paperwork to a degree I could understand. And it didn't take all day.
     I have been in the retail business since 1969.  These 3 GENTLEMEN were some of the best that I have seen with proffesional courtesy and care for me as a customer.  They were truly there to take care of and to solve my wife's and my concerns and needs for a new vehicle.
    Thanks again Greg, Aaron and Andrew!!!",5.0

Never thought I would ever leave Ford but my children insisted on my trying a Toyota van. Reluctantly I went and picked a Sienna to try.

110,"December 11, 2018","Wow, where do I begin with my experience here? On the 10th of November, I went to pick up my 'new to me' Ford Edge from Lithia Toyota of Abilene. 
I must say that I was ecstatic to be accepted even with my low credit! When I got there and picked up my vehicle and drove it for the first time, it felt amazing. I enjoyed the newer model, louder stereo, the smooth drive, the more powerful engine!

However, that experience would only last for about five days. That's when the trouble began. 5 days after I got the vehicle, I was making an exit
and my tool light came on and my speed and miles suddenly vanished. I wasn't able to tell how fast I was going, luckily I was on a hill so I eased into a parking space safely. When I got there, I turned the engine off and then turned it back on and the whole car shook and a big bang occurred. 
Remember, this is five days afterward. When I contacted the dealership, they told me it was an as is car. Luckily the financer hadn't closed out my contract so they were somewhat pressured to fix the car. Which Ford misdiagnosed the problem because there was no check engine or tool light on
when I took it. 

Well, the first problem got fixed. But that wasn't the end of my worries, no. I noticed that the rpm gauge was giving me problems and about 3 days afterward
the car just stopped in the middle of a turn, again, I was lucky to be in a parking lot! I was able to get the car to turn back on and was able to drive it. 
I figured it must've been from the cold night or something. Anyways, I drove it another day and then the tool light came on, the same exact issue occurred! 
Luckily I was able to get it home to where it completely died. My car in less than thirty days is completely out! It doesn't work. 

Oh, and that isn't mentioning the fact that they lied to the creditor and told them I'd been working a job for two years when I told them specifically
that it was my new job. I was told that there were new tires, and come to find out that they were worn and weathered pretty good. I was told
the car went through an extensive check, but from what happened, that was a lie as well!

So, I say don't buy a car from Lithia Toyota of Abilene! They very clearly sold me a Lemon. I am taking an L by losing my 1500 dollar down payment
but I am also taking an L on my credit because of the 14,000 dollars they wanted for the vehicle with the interest.

I messaged them, they haven't returned anything back to me. This is a sad situation I am in, but at least I can save someone else the hassle of going through this!

SO DO NOT BUY FROM THIS PLACE!!!",1.0

121,"November 26, 2018","For some time now, I had been looking into getting a new vehicle but couldn‚Äôt find many deals for what I could afford. When I visited my mother for the holidays, she suggested that I look at the local dealerships. At first, I cringed, thinking back to my previous experiences at other car dealerships from when I was younger because many of them tried to sell us vehicles that we explicitly told them we weren‚Äôt interested in (not at the Toyota of Abilene; this was a first time visit for us).

I remember pulling up into the parking lot of the Lithia, seeing a small group of salesmen and thinking that things weren‚Äôt going to end well, as in the past mum family‚Äôs experience was the following:  be approached by salesperson, listen to them give a spiel about how great the company/car lot they work for is, feign actual interest that we just so happened to share, and then think that just because they‚Äôve done steps A, B, and C, that they some how have magically convinced me to take a vehicle that I didn‚Äôt want in the first place.  Earlier that day, I had pretty much given up on finding anything with the budget that I had and didn‚Äôt have high hopes when we visited Lithia.

And then, there was Greg. 

Much to my surprise, and relief, Mr. Parks didn‚Äôt waste time with the age-old ‚Äúlet me pretend to be interested in what you do because I have a quota to make,‚Äù song and dance. Very straightforward and down to business, and never once did I ever get the notion that he would try to take advantage of me as a customer. He was given a price range, a preferred type of vehicle, and never once attempted to divert me over to something I didn‚Äôt want unlike the Arrow Ford, a place that I had visited just hours before.  Pretty sure I told the people at Arrow Ford at least five times that I didn‚Äôt want rear-wheel drive.  

Moving on, Greg found the RAV4 that I now currently have. He was very thorough in explaining and demonstrating all the safety features of the vehicle and has made it clear on more than one occasion that I‚Äôm always welcome to ask him questions on how it works.  I honestly can‚Äôt say enough about how well he did his job and would highly recommend him and Abilene Lithia as a whole to anyone in search of a new vehicle.  ",5.0

We told mark what we were looking for and the monthly payment we were after. He contacted us the next day and had an offer that was $80 more a month than we asked for. My only suggestion would be this, listen to your customers just a little more when they talk. If you cant make the car they want fit in that budget tell them that. I gave this rating of 4 out of 5 stars because everyone, including the powers that crunch numbers and make decisions can use improvement and work on something to better themselves. It was nice though, that the dealership let us take the vehicle over night, so that we could see if we liked it and gave us a chance to finalize our financing options the next morning.

He was laid back and made us feel welcome, even though we had no clue what we were actually looking for. Our intent was just to look around and test drive some pickup trucks. Aaron was very informative about all of the trucks we looked at. He answered all of our questions even when I asked questions that may have seemed silly. We weren't sure we could afford to make a purchase right now, but Aaron assured us, he would get us a great deal. We decided to go ahead and purchase the 2016 Dodge Ram and we began the paper work. Aaron and the other gentleman that went over the paper work with us were both awesome and kept us feeling confident in our purchase. They even ended up getting us a better deal than orginally discussed. Just two days after our purchase, Aaron called to check on us and make sure we were stll happy with our purchase.

Our salesperson, Sara McCarter, was simply the best we've ever worked with.  Sara is an excellent communicator.  Her knowledge about the car that we were considering was very impressive, and she answered every question we had.  She was patient, not rushing us at all, and she remained pleasant the whole time we were with her.  In fact, we can confidently say that our final decision to choose the car we bought and to buy it locally is because of Sara McCarter and the way she helped us.

In addition to Sara McCarter, two others who added to our positive experience were Jim Buckner and Andrew Elliot.  In our interactions with each of these Lithia folks we found them to be thorough, knowledgeable, and professional.

Jimmy T. was very helpful and very down to Earth. Shan was actually the one that we were referred to from our longtime friend Levi, but was busy helping others when we arrived. All salesmen were attentive to our needs and helped us pick the one we thought we needed and started off with trying to get the lowest interest possible. After i got home I realized that i truly wanted the adventure trim of the Rav4 more. Between Shan and Jimmy, and the awesome finance manager Andrew, they hooked us up and took back the original and we will be getting an adventure model in the same color delivered from another dealer. If they would have had the color at the time we were first there, i bet we wouldve got that one and not wasted anyones time. Nevertheless, there wasnt one person there that showed any frustration with us. Too bad i dont have more money or a need for more vehicles at this time! You may not get as much money taken off the top from this dealer as they seem to do that before you even show up, but the quality of the vehicle and customer service left all the competitors in the dust!

388,"March 11, 2018","We just moved from Corpus Christi to Colorado City and Abilene was listed as the closest dealership. When I booked the oil change all they had was an oil change with tire rotation for around $67. I requested a quote for just an oil change under the comments/questions section, but I never heard back. My wife, who went in alone, was charged $86 for the oil change. She drives a 4 cylinder 2016 RAV 4. This is more than double than what our old dealership charged, $20 more than the oil change with tire rotation that was booked and $35 more than the Nissan dealership charges on their website to change the oil in my 2017 Titan with a V8. I originally text with the dealership and was told they would call me back then I left a message with a live person at the dealership. No one has called me back. Today, a Sunday, I left another message on voicemail, but I am skeptical anyone will call me back. In the past 5 years we have purchased several new Toyotas including a Corola, Prius, two RAV 4s and two Tacomas. Mike Shaw in Corpus Christi has always treated us very well.

I called Internet Manager Aaron Coker and had a very brief and amicable conversation which confirmed everything that I already knew, and I counter-offered just to make sure they were firm on the price.  They did actually come down just a bit, from the price which, as I have already said, I knew to be lower by far than other comps.  Anyway, total time on the three phone calls was less than 10 minutes to consummate the deal.  Later the same day I made the 2-hour drive to Abilene to pick up the truck.  I had told Aaron that I needed to be done quickly, and he and Michael Miziker (finance) performed again - they honored my request by not wasting any time trying to sell me add-ons and warranties, hurried the whole process along, and my total time at the dealership was about 30 minutes before I drove the truck off the lot.",5.0

456,"January 09, 2018","We had loss of a vehicle due to accident in DFW area recently. We have been Lithia customers since 2013.
We purchased a used vehicle from Lithia selected by Jim Buckner. He assigned Sales Consultant, Ken Terry to take care of us. Mr. Terry is not only professional, but diligent an could without doubt teach classes on customer service. He has given attention to every need and provided answers to every question.  He introduced us to Michael Mizikar, Finance Manager who assisted us with purchase of additional coverage. Ken is what I would describe as ""golden"". His value to a service business like Lithia cannot be overestimated. Thanks Ken and thank you Jim. We are happy with our new car and especially the kindness of Lithia people.

So Jimmy called on a regular basis but not annoying as we had become aquatinted well , so calls me just to ask how we were doing and to tell me of current sales events . So we were at Kohl‚Äôs shopping for Christmas presents and I decided to stop in and wish Jimmy a Merry CHRISTmas and of course we got out to greet him and ‚Äújust look‚Äù was our intention and Jimmy gave us a quick reveiw of the inventory which prompted my wife to ask where is That car ? Jimmy did a very thorough and knowledgeable presentation that sold my wife without a test drive . She told him that‚Äôs okay we will take it right Honey . Of course it was a yes and we wrapped everything thing up in record time thanks to John McCutchen who was very professional and even brought me my signature doughnut and Mike Mizikar who with persistence also was able to overcome obstacles and gave me an additional 2 points on interest rate so with those savings we purchased the Platinum package ! Jimmy will receive referrals from me and Toyota has gained countless future customers as my Son who is Graduating wants a Corrola . I believe in the product as does Jimmy and Jimmy also gained a few pointers from this retired salesman that he may use for his benefit. So believe in your product, know your product, know your inventory and use All the sales team to the Companies advantage for your future sales and never , Never give up .",5.0

Since I had the day off and I'm not an internet car shopper,  I made a few stops around town to other dealerships to physically look at, smell, touch and feel the trucks that caught my attention keeping in mind my specific purpose and struck out for one reason or another. Then I made my way to Lithia to look at a used Chevrolet truck that caught my eye.  I wasn't expecting to make a purchase this day, just wanted an Idea of what options there were out there to wrap my head around the the kind of money trucks cost nowadays. Jody saw us looking and introduced himself and from the beginning of the conversation was looking to help me find what I was looking weather I bought here or not. He tirelessly walked from vehicle to vehicle and allowed me and my wife to have a look without any judgement. What I come to like best about dealing with Jody is that we felt no pressure to make the deal. In the end his keen knowledge and insight of the Toyota truck product allowed me the time and information I needed to make an informed purchase which I am  happy with knowing I have a brand new 2017 truck for only a few bucks more that a used one with many miles on it from a different manufacturer. After being a lifelong GM man with back problems, I can tell you that this truck doesn't ride like any other truck I have ever owned, it's actually a very smooth ride and my back appreciates it.

Mark, called me within 3 minutes to inquire my interest and was never pushy or trying to sell me a pitch. I decided to come in and test drive the vehicle. Mark was extremely honest and never pressured me into making a decision. I left without a deal, and went back to work/discussed with the wife my interest. I came back later that afternoon and Mark took the time to show my wife the vehicle and answered all questions. After all was said and done on the home front, I decided to proceed with the purchase. Mark ensured I got the amount I wanted for my trade-in and got me a better deal than I was willing to settle for. Once I got the deal I wanted, Andrew Elliot walked me through all the paperwork from the financial side and was done pretty quick. The whole process took about 2 hours and it was pleasant.

What is most important is that he had absolute confidence in the fact that the financing could go without a hitch,  even though I had to work with an insurance company before I could buy a car.   He is a consummate professional. There was no pressure, just confidence in his product, and mastery of the car-buying process from every angle.

He showed it to me and I did a test drive. I wasn't thrilled about the color or the price for a used vehicle. He called me the next day and told me he could put me in a 2017 version for just a couple thousand more - and I could get the color I wanted. I went and looked at the 2017 models. After thinking about it I decided I didn't want to spend that much money. I told him I would be fine with the model with fewer options which cost less. He found exactly what I was looking for and agreed to a reasonable price for the new car and a reasonable price for my trade in - even though they were going to lose money on the deal (I wondered if he was smiling when he said that - isn't that phrase in the sales training manual???).

776,"February 09, 2017","I went in to purchase a new and used vehicle a while back. The new vehicle was already at a great price but used car was debatable due to damage from dealer. We started dealing with Mr. Rodriguez which was a good experience but then it seemed as if he was not the one to have the last say. We then dealt with Mr. Beverly and tried to come to an agreement on the used car deal but to no avail. I brought a friend along as she was well versed with car purchases and sales manager was just rude and uncooperative once she was in the picture. After hours of bargaining on the used car, we finally gave up and just went with the purchase of the new car since they refused to sell the used car which had prior damage and was willing to purchasing it at a lower price due to damages but it wasn't going to happen as they still wanted to get a fair value for that vehicle with damages. Towards the end, we all sat down with Mr. Pyeatt and was very nice at first but things started going downhill once my friend tried to help us as they were trying to sell us a warranty and who knows what else that was really unnecessary and they did not really appreciate that. I don't come to a dealership to be taken advantage off just so you know and never will because I would like to know all my avenues and rights as a customer and if that involves bringing a friend that knows more about car buying, well guess what; it will happen either you like it or not and as far as I am concerned, I will not be buying another car from you again if that is the experience you offer. I am the one taking and paying for the loan and not you Mr. Pyeatt so you trying to add extra things that I am not willing to pay for, should not be any of your concerns after you have already explained the reason to add this feature on.

807,"December 04, 2016","Over the past couple of months I searched high and low, statewide, for a Toyota Tundra and was unable to commit until I found exactly what I wanted at Lithia Toyota of Abilene. Within minutes of seeing the truck for sale, I contacted the dealership. When I spoke with Mark Harris, he was knowledgeable and helpful, enough so, that I knew immediately I wanted to do business with Mark. Mark was extremely efficient and had final pricing options to me within minutes. I've bought many cars over the years and Mark, by far, was the most professional and efficient salesman I've worked with.  After work I drove 85 miles to Abilene to pick up my new truck and when I arrived, Mark was waiting with keys in hand for a test drive. Following a quick test drive around the lot, as I was in a hurry to get home that night, I completed the the necessary paperwork to take possession of the truck. Amazingly, and due to Mark's preparation and with Mike M. working the numbers in Finance, I was in and out of the dealership and on my way home in about an hour. Amazing customer service! I highly recommend contacting Mark at Lithia Toyota of Abilene for your next car/truck purchase. I know I sure will!.

I've been working with Philip Underwood for years. Got my mother-in-law a used car, my son a used car and now I finally broke down and got a 2017 Tundra from Philip. Both used cars are still on the road after many years and buying process was easy.
The Tundra was even better because they didn't have exactly what I was looking for on the lot. I sat down with Philip and we spec'ed out exactly what I wanted and placed the order. 6 weeks later my truck, exactly as I wanted, was there. We did the credit approval over the phone and when I walked in to see it, all the paperwork was ready to go. After a quick test drive (truck was completely detailed) it took less than an hour to get all processed and drive away with a new vehicle. I will continue to go back to Philip for all my car needs.

871,"July 30, 2016","Let me give my disclaimer; I've never been to this dealership. My review is based on the experience of my parents.

My parents have a mid 2000's Camry ('05 I believe) that they purchased new from Toyota of Abilene. They have solely used the dealership (driving about an hour) for maintenance and repairs. Things were great, until about a year ago.....  


While checking the fluids on the car for them, I discovered an issue with the bolts that hold the air filter cover down. One was missing, and one was broken. The lid was loosely sitting in place. Again, this is the only shop to touch the car, so it had to have happened there. I'm guessing a tech broke bolts (maybe using an impact gun?), and didn't want to get in trouble (the only way to replace them is to order an entire air cleaner unit). The bolts are of a peculiar design, but I was able to find some hardware that works.


At their last visit (for an oil change), they were told they have a steering system leak, and need a new pump and steering rack (at a price of around $2,000). Given the age of the car and the number of miles, it's fully plausible. They'd been discussing the possibility of replacing the car, so they decided to wait on having the work done. 

Out of curiosity, I checked the power steering fluid level, and found it to be massively overfilled (almost to the top of the reservoir). Depending on the design of the system, overfilling it can cause a few different problems (or a combination). The system can leak due to the increased hydraulic pressure. Air can be induced into the system, causing pump and/or rack failure. Fluid can overflow from the reservoir, at the risk of causing a fire.

None of these scenarios are good. I immediately adjusted the fluid level to where it should be. It's been a few months now (and a couple thousand miles) and the car has not lost a drop of fluid. I can't find any evidence of a leak. 

I can't help to come to the conclusion that the service department was trying to rip off my parents. There's no other explanation for a technician diagnosing a steering leak and then overfilling the system. That's only going to exasperate an existing leak (which I'm fairly certain there isn't one), or create a new one (thus, needing replacement). 


Maybe the rest of the dealership is alright, but I'd be skeptical of the service department. It should go without saying that my parents won't be back. ",1.0

He followed up on the order and kept  me informed of the status every step of the way. The truck arrived on the day he promised (3 months after it was ordered) and made sure that all the options I wanted were installed and a couple of small problems were corrected right away and to my satisfaction. He offered a fair trade on my 2006 Tacoma and did his best to honor that price after the 3 months it took for the 2016 to arrive. Overall my experience dealing with Mark has been an excellent one.

883,"June 25, 2016","I had another awesome experience at Lithia Toyota of Abilene... This was a shocker only went in to see if I should wait to get another vehicle or not and didn't plan on getting one. I had looked at a 2014 Toyota Tundra SR and liked it but wasn't loving it so I decided to hold off and the team had kept looking after I left and I didn't know they were until I got home later that day and saw I had a few missed calls and a few texts to come back they had some other truck options they would like me to see that they were positive I could get into. I came back and ended up leaving with a 2015 Toyota Tundra TSS, I was much happier with this truck and it was more my style. The color at first I wasn't sure about in the picture, but after physically seeing it I had to test drive it. I traded in my 2014 Toyota RAV4 XLE with cloth seats, and fully loaded and the only thing I lost out of the trade is I do not have the navigation and sun roof anymore and those are minor things, and the sunroof itself to me would be really weird on a truck anyways lol. I love my truck more now and already purchased accessories for it to make it feel more like my vehicle.  I left and the sales people involved as well as the Finance departments manager Michael Mizikar as well as the sales people John Nichols and Samuel W. Sloan. they actually made all the bad experience's I have had in my life with buying a car seem much better. They did not push me into something I would not like and they even went above and beyond to make sure I got a good deal and was happy when I left. I was a repeat customer and if I ever trade in my current vehicle or something drastic happens to it I will again return to Lithia for the great service and experience I have received from them before as well as this time again...

I am very familiar with what makes Ken and the entire Lithia Toyota dealership different, but her only experience with car dealerships was when she went with us to buy the little car that both her and her older brother learned to drive.  We were greeted in the rain as we exited our car and were escorted inside while they located Ken.  We were offered coffee, water or soft drinks while they let Ken know we were there.  Ken had the used car we had come to look at pulled inside of a bay so we could stay dry.  My daughter and I test drove the car and then we got down to the business of getting settled on price, trade in, and letting the dealership look for a better finance rate than we had found with our bank.  All with absolutely no stress or pressure.  Ken and the entire staff were nothing but professional and courteous and there was never any pressure.

I joked with Ken that we were trading in the last car that I had purchased without him as the salesperson!

I bought my first Camry in Lubbock and had it serviced at lithia Toyota in Abilene and was extremely pleased every time I went in because the service person named Deborah ALWAYS took the time to make sure my car was serviced correctly, all recalls were taken care of when I brought it in but most of all every time I went in she made me feel like I was important and that my concerns were valid.  She was knowledgeable about her job and never made me feel like I was being a bother to her.  We were so pleased with lithia that I bought my next 2 camry's there.  Debra, our service person promoted and went to the Honda house.  From that point on every time I make an appt.. for my car for anything from oil changes to recalls etc the service department was rude and acted like they didn't have time for me.  The last time I went in for service I told them the drivers seat heater didn't work on high.  I was told that it wasn't covered by my extended warranty.  I had to get the salesman that sold me the extended warranty to go to the service dept. so they would honor the warranty ( I had called the service dept. 2 different times trying to talk to someone about the seat heater.  Every time I called I was told that someone would call me back.  It never happened.)  With all the calls I have made to lithia to make service appointments for my car today was the first time anyone bothered to return my call, thanks so much Christi).

He didn't just tolerate me; he respected me and that is something I remain extremely grateful for. Thank you, Ken Terry, and the wonderful team at Toyota of Abilene. ",5.0
1020,"November 07, 2015","I cannot say enough good things about my experience with Lithia Toyota and my sales guy, Kyle Corr!  When everywhere else couldn't or wouldn't help me, they went above and beyond to make sure I was in a safe, new, and warrantied vehicle at terms I could handle.  They also made sure that it was something I would at least like and that fit the majority of my criteria and needs.  In this day and age of laziness, I got to experience a great work ethic from my sales guy and his management team!  That is SO rare these days!!!  Kyle was amazing from the first time I spoke with him MONTHS ago, and he never gave up on me, was patient with my list of wants, and made sure to let me know that he was thinking about my list of wants and needs during the last 2 or 3 months.  He met every challenge I threw at him with sheer determination, a smile, and compassion for my situation.  He was persistent in going to bat with finance for me and brought me a great deal on a car that I am very impressed with!  So, THANK YOU, Lithia Toyota and Kyle Corr for an amazing and wonderful experience that still has me smiling like the Cheshire cat, today!!!!  You guys ROCK!!!! --Jenny Moorhead ",5.0

1031,"October 23, 2015","Here's my review on their Facebook page.

This is the second issue I have had with the service departemnt. The first time I wanted almost 3 hours for an oil change when I had an appt first thing in the morning and atleast one individual that was told right next to me it would take 3 to 4 hours since he was a walk in. He said no problem he would wait just like me and I had an appointment. So how his got done before mine had even been taken in to be started on. Now on to the most recent. I brought my truck in last week for a problem that had been previously fixed less than a 1000 miles it happens again. They had to order the part which I understand then when the part came in they discovered something else was wrong and had to order more parts. I dropped it back off on Thursday and I went to get it this morning. They didn't even put my dash back together properly as in not even pushed/clipped in. There were pieces missing that are meant to secure the plastic panels as well. I gave them the benefit of doubt on the first issue.  When I went to.get it for the 2nd time they didn't even put the cover on my cabin air filter in the glove box or connect the attend wire to my stereo. They had to take it back to the technician two times just to get it right.",1.3

1036,"October 14, 2015","The very first time we went to the lot it was a little past 6pm. Sarah (our salesperson) didn't act like she was the least bit interested in showing us any car and definitely not one that she would have to walk into the office to get the key. It really made me mad. But since I went there looking for a specific used car we went back and found the car I was looking for. We ended up not only purchasing 1 car but 2 cars. The whole buying process was bologna. We were very irritated at how long it took and yes I know this is all apart of the process. I have gone here before and it did not take near as long as this time. We were there from 1pm-8pm. We had said initially wanted to wait till the next day in order to talk to our banks and when they came back with the interest rates and the numbers they were so very high! They flat out lied and said my bank was trying to give me an even higher interest rate! xxxxxxxx! I called my bank and it was about half the interest rate they quoted me!  I strongly believe in honest customer service! I just am so very dissappointed in myself for letting them do me wrong! But I really didn't think Toyota of Abilene would do that! My mom has bought several cars from here and my sister in law just bought a brand new one. I will never again come here for any car!! DO NOT GO HERE! DONT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY! After we had purchased the cars I asked for a second key and Sarah said she would look for it and let me know. I called twice and finally my husband texted her and asked and her reply was ""sorry we couldn't find it."" He called he sales manager Craig...and Craig (apparently the only decent human being who works here) said he would get us a key made free of charge. But the fact that Sarah did not even care pissed me off! I just gave yall 40,000 and you don't even care to give me a second key??!!!!Have some integrity people!",1.2

1040,"October 04, 2015","Walked into San Angelo, Mitchell Toyota looking for a Sequoia to fulfill the needs of my growing family. I was in contact with the internet sales guy (Gary) for over a week and when we finally made it in, he started off very friendly, interested. He walked us around showing us a few sequoias. He then asked me what amount of monthly payment I was looking for, and I replied with $450-$500. Of course I'm not an idiot and realize that it might take some give on my part to make it work....But once i said that number he almost rolled his eyes in thinking "" great another unreasonable customer that wants it all for nothing"" He was obviously no longer interested in entertaining my ideal car payment. He immediately started steering us towards other vehicles, "" have you heard of a 4 runner? "" lets look at something more your price range""...Really? If I wanted a freaking 4 runner, I would have come in and asked for it...
He never even asked how much I was going to put down!!! I made one call to Kyle Corr in Abilene Toyota and within a few days He had not only the Sequoia we wanted and color, but in a brand new 2016!. He was great in communicating with me on wants, needs, and options. I never felt pressured to buy. He answered my call on a few occasions when he was on his off day!! He never ignored me. They didn't even have the sequoia, they had to drive it down from Dallas! It takes that little bit of extra effort to get my business. He did that and then some. We went through USAA for financing and they tried to match it. At least they tried. They were very honest and friendly guys. 
The only reason they didn't get 5 stars was at the end I had expressed that we wanted to get on the road in a hurry because we had an hour and half drive back to San Angelo, And  i didn't want my wife and 5 month old twin girls to drive back in the dark. I mentioned that I wasn't interested in any warranties, and they still took me to the back room away from my wife and kids and tried the sales pitch again. I had already said no. What part don't they understand. I understand its part of the process but I already anticipated the "" let me get so- and so so they can explain the options to you"" So i already said no. It made our experience driving home terrible cause both girls were done sitting in car seats and strollers so it was a cry fest all the way back home in our new Sequoia. Other than that Kyle Corr was Awesome, great representation of the quality training they give their employees. I will always recommend him and Lithia Toyota to everyone I meet. Stay away from Mitchell in San Angelo, they don't care.",4.8

They even placed a bow on the car which I thought was very sweet.  This dealership did an amazing job taking care of me and they have some very wonderful employees!  I highly recommend them!  ",5.0

1087,"July 07, 2015","I recently purchased a Camry @ Lithia Toyota of Abilene. My salesperson was Mr Mark Harris. He was very knowledgeable about the vehicles. Very friendly, courteous, attentive and easy to communicate with. I felt he was truly interested in making me feel comfortable about choosing the right vehicle. I appreciate his honesty when it came to settling on a final price. My encounter with Mark and the professional manner in which he handled this transaction has led to several referrals for him! I hope my referrals have the same positive experience purchasing their new vehicle. Looking forward to doing business with Mark again in the future. Andrew Elliot was my financial manager; he was extremely organized, efficient and informative. He took the time to customize my extended warranty plan. He was very easy to talk to and has an awesome personality. He made the closing of the deal a pleasure! Hold onto Andy, he is a definite asset to your company.

They ALWAYS go over and above to see that we are taken care of, wouldn't think of going anywhere else!  We have a 4-runner for 9 years that we sold to a friend that had no problems, our 2006 Highlander is still working like a charm.

Hubert worked with others in the dealership to find me a green one at another dealership.  We made a deal and the car was ordered.  Unfortunately, when the car came in, the interior color was not what I wanted and I was faced with waiting a long time to get the right one or settle for the one present.

I would of liked to had a little more privacy or maybe coziness (so to say) at the table inside where we did our discussion. It was located right at the front door so you almost felt exposed or on the spot. I pretty much new what I wanted and living in the Big Country did not give any other dealers around a chance to compete or even shop them. That may of been a mistake but again I new what I wanted and my range of what I wanted to spend.  Greg Parks assisted me in showing, explaining and demonstrating the vehicles I was interested in. During the inside portion it was the annoying we talk to Greg then Greg goes off to the war room. They have a worksheet that you write numbers on and at one point we agreed to a price and stated OTD on it. I guess I have a different idea of what OTD means but somehow it ended up at a price about 5 over that. Again my fault for when I got in the finance guys office to sign I did not thoroughly review the contract and ask questions.  The great thing about Greg was he was not pushy and even willing to let me leave the lot with out having to call the police to get away from the salesmen. Greg is what made this experience the Excellent mark.

After dealing with 5 different Toyota dealers in Dallas I called Phil on a 2015 Tacoma, I probably came off as a jerk because I was so frustrated with the games I had played with the 5 previous dealers in Dallas but I was in for a surprise as this was going to be the perfect buying experience!

Phil is easy going and not pushy which is what I was looking for, and unlike the other dealers I had dealt with he knew what he was selling. One salesman didn't know the difference between a 4x4 and a 4x2! Yep I got some dumb answers and blank looks from some of the dealers in Dallas but not with Phil. 

Phil picked me up at the airport in my new Tacoma and drove me back to the dealership so we could get all the paperwork done and I could head back to Dallas. Phil had all the paperwork done in no time and was out showing me the radio and controls for the truck and I was on my way back to Dallas.

Phil even called and checked on me to make sure I got back safe and also to check to see if I had any questions or problems with the truck.

1145,"May 01, 2015","Full disclosure, I hate haggling no matter the car dealer, so take that part with a grain of salt when you read about it below.  With that out of the way‚Ä¶

Last weekend I decided to buy a new vehicle and trade in what I was driving.  I entered queries into True Car pricing knowing I wouldn‚Äôt get any responses until Monday.  After receiving e-mails from various deals, including Lubbock and Weatherford (I live in Abilene), I got a call from Chris Herrington at Lithia Toyota.  I had missed his call, so called him back and we set up a 4Runner test drive for after work.  Did the test drive, LOVED the vehicle, and started working the numbers.  Chris was quick to honor the True Car pricing (you get a certificate you can print out from the internet query) which was great.  Then we got a little bogged down on trade in price, as Lithia didn‚Äôt seem to want to honor either KBB or NADA trade in prices, even at the ‚Äúgood‚Äù rating‚Ä¶the car I was trading was easily in the ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù category with only 8200 miles.  I say Lithia because I don‚Äôt know if it was Chris haggling or the sales manager since it was the usual salesman going back and forth out of sight exercise.  We did eventually settle on a number I could live with‚Ä¶it just shouldn‚Äôt have had to take over an hour of haggling to get there.

In the end, I would certainly recommend Lithia of Abilene AND Chris Herrington as a sales consultant‚Ä¶just make sure to do your due diligence, get your True Car pricing and be prepared to stick to your guns on your trade in (and know your numbers).  As mentioned at the beginning of this review, this is true of any car dealership.

As for the 4Runner?  I picked up the 4Runner Limited and it is the first true SUV I‚Äôve ever owned.  Had a Bronco II in the 90‚Äôs and my wife has had back to back Ford Escapes, but this 4Runner is in an ENTIRELY different class.  Haven‚Äôt driven it much yet (worked all week), but what I have it is A.W.E.S.O.M.E.  It is also my first Toyota ever in almost 40 years of buying cars‚Ä¶I expect I will be purchasing more in the future and trying to talk my wife into dropping the Escapes when it‚Äôs time to trade up.
Again, thanks to Chris Herrington at Lithia Toyota for all your help, your in-depth knowledge of what I was looking for, and your thorough explanation of all systems in the vehicle at delivery.  I‚Äôll definitely be requesting you next time it‚Äôs time to find a vehicle at Lithia.

When it came down to brass tax, he worked hard with his sales manager to meet a price of a different dealer in the metroplex. He went through every detail of the vehicle and scheduled our first service. When it was all over, he brought by a box of cookies. He has contacted me post-sale to follow up and make sure we didn't have any questions. ",5.0

The dealer was most encouraging to us and his salesman.  It was obvious that he nurtures his employees but expects excellence in meeting the buyers' satisfaction.   I hope to get my daughter and son-in-law and sister to visit Lithia Toyota in Abilene soon.  David Brigham, our salesman, is the most capable salesman we have ever dealt with. He was extremely knowledgeable in sales and Toyota. We really did not think we could trade but all involved made it so easy.  In addition, Ron Morton, the finance manager, was very nice, and he took the time to explain all the papers.  Overall, signing the papers was a most pleasant experience.

1157,"March 15, 2015","I was contacted by Lithia Toyota to come in and discuss the possibility of trading in my 2010 Toyota Prius for a new vehicle as used Toyotas are in short supply.  I had no intention of trading, since I was perfectly happy with my Prius but was curious to see what it was worth.  Dylan Daniel and Mark Harris sat with me and we discussed options.  They were very professional, and not pushy at all, and I decided to continue with an application after seeing and driving a 2014 PriusV, which just happened to be a bit bigger than mine Prius, and a lovely blue color.  I still was not going to buy, just wanted to see how the numbers added up.  After all was calculated, I still was apprehensive because I had been ""upside down"" on my current vehicle and was sure I would just enter into the same problem with a newer vehicle.  However, Mark explained how the discounts and dealer incentives would cancel out my inequity.  He also pointed out that I have 41 months left on my payments with my current Prius, and it was already 5 years old, and would be nearly 9 years old when paid off, and not very valuable should I need to trade it in.  I knew also that my extended warranty would be up in one year on my current car.  Adding all this together, I decided to buy the newer vehicle which would provide many more years of service and great warranties.  These guys were very patient with me and again, not pushy.  I recommend them both.  To add positively to the experience, Ron Morton the finance manager who worked with me was a joy to visit with!  ",5.0

1183,"December 16, 2014","After the car accident that totaled my car I was dreading going through the car-buying experience. We drove in from Midland (where prices are astronomical) and visited one other place before Lithia Toyota of Abilene and had a terrible experience. The salesman didn't listen to my needs and proceeded to show me cars at the high end of my budget. We left there and tried this dealership and I will never again buy from a different location. The service was absolutely AMAZING. 

Gary met us as we pulled into the lot and we went over what we were looking for. He was never pushy or ""in a hurry"". He talked with us as Craig came over and helped guide us in the right direction. They were both knowledgeable and understanding of our price budget. When offered if I would like to start with the high-end or lower-end of the cars we were looking at neither of them pushed us toward the ""luxury/high end"" models but actually recommended we start with the basics because ""I find some people are more than happy with the basics and don't get that ""missing out"" feeling"". That was when I knew I'd be buying a car from them. 

I ended up asking to see several models, test drove, and ended up with the car I really wanted - and it was even on the lower end! Neither Craig nor Gary pushed me in any direction and left my SO and I ideal time to discuss everything - and brought us water. My SO actually even traded in his car for another car on the lot (that no one even needed to sell him on, he just fell in love with it pulling in). When we explained that we were in a hurry to get back to Midland they promised to make the process go as quickly as possible - and they weren't joking. We didn't have to do much negotiating - it was within budget and the two cars together were actually less a month than we would have been spending if we had just got myself a car and him leaving in the same one he had. Gary and Craig made the process AMAZINGLY fast (we joked as went along, which always makes time fly anyway) and although the financing part took longer (Mike, in finance, was also amazing) it still went faster buying two cars than it did the last time we bought ONE car.

Neither of us left there feeling jipped or upset with what we were getting. We both found our perfect cars for the right price and with the help of 3 awesome guys. I am recommending this dealership to everyone I know with no reservations. I feel like I could call Craig or Gary and get any questions answered and help with my car with zero frustrations. 

I am beyond happy with this dealership and can't say it enough. A HUGE thanks to the 3 guys that helped us enjoy a car buying experience!",4.8

Took care of all my wants in a vehicle and out did Ford by a long shot even set up my first service appointment. Thanks Lithia Toyota of Abilene.,5.0

1206,"October 21, 2014","After having a less than favorable experience in Midland with a Toyota dealer that obviously did not think they needed our business I talked to Ken Terry on the phone and he immediately let me know that they did not have what we were looking for, but he would find it.  He did!  We ended up with a model year newer vehicle with more options for a better price.  The value of what we got far exceeded what we were shown in Midland!  On top of that we got a better price on our trade in.  Some would say that it all boiled down to price, but in the end we spent a little more on the vehicle but we were treated as if they wanted our business.  It is hard to explain how in Midland we were only about $1,800 apart on completing a deal, but never felt like they wanted or needed our business.  Instead we got more vehicle, drove over 300 miles round trip and still felt better about the car we purchased and how we were treated.

Everybody at this dealership treated us as if it was their job to make sure we knew they wanted our business!  We never felt pressured to purchase the 4 Runner even though they had brought it in for us to look at, it was part of the service.

If you are looking for a Toyota and are within driving distance, call them!  Call Ken!  If you are in the Abilene area and you need to know just how good you have it.... come to Midland and see what kind of service you get!",5.0

1209,"October 09, 2014","My husband and I were not in the market for a vehicle purchase. Our used 1998 Honda Accord has been a money pit for the past 2 years. The last time it broke down it was way too expensive to fix. We went to Lithia Toyota on a Sunday on purpose because I wanted to take my time and just see what they had. The next day I went online to view used vehicles under 10k. I showed interest and got a call from Phillip Underwood. I was at work so I couldn't answer. He emailed me soon after letting me know he would be happy to assist me. We told him what type of payments we were looking for, no trade-in, and no money down. We came in to test drive the first vehicle but it had some mechanical issues and he walked with my husband and I around the lot to pick something else out. We test drove a 2008 Toyota Corolla. We liked it and he submitted the paperwork to my bank. That didn't work out with no money down or with the type of payment we had budgeted. So I looked online and found a 2013 Toyota Corolla. I called Phillip and told him ""try that one for us"". He sent in the paperwork to our bank. Phillip held that car for us for over a week until we could get some things taken care of before the loan was approved. Phillip gave us our space. He checked up just the right amount of times. Not too many times and didn't let too much time pass either. He was relaxed and made us feel at ease. Everything worked out great! No money down and our monthly payments were within our budget. I will definitely recommend Lithia Toyota and Phillip Underwood to anyone I know that is in the market for buying a pre-owned or new Toyota. We will definitely come back when we are ready for a Toyota Tundra. My experience with buying a pre-owned vehicle from a dealership was a great one. But made even better by buying a pre-owned Toyota from an awesome team at Lithia Toyota!",5.0
1210,"October 06, 2014","I have been doing research looking for a used Toyota 4 Runner. Honestly I looked all over Texas.  The past 2 days have been a roller coaster of emotions. If you are looking or even thinking about a new car please consider a Toyota and PLEASE let me give you the name of the amazing salesman in Abilene TX at Lithia Toyota of Abilene, TX. His name is Mark Harris. His name and number will stay in my phone. I have been in sales a long time. This man is good and honest at what he does! Amazing does not do justice in his serving me the past month! Ron Morton also because he too treated me with a kindness and thoughtfulness that will head me back to Abilene to consider for my next Toyota! God through Mark blessed me with the ownership of a 2012 Pearl White Toyota 4 Runner with low mileage! 
 I will not spend time in details but at one point in this process I was ready to walk out and leave.  3 men looked at me when I smiled with a face that reminded me of a BAD situation when I was considering looking to get a newer one a couple of years ago.  I was in Lewisville, TX at the Toyota dealership.  I will never go back to that one ever again.
However, Mark Harris is the reason I said yes in Abilene, TX.  He is good at what he does. He and Ron‚Äôs heart are in it for the right reason. They treat people the way they want to be treated and I blessed because of that!  Thanks Lithia of Abilene‚Ä¶I am a walking ad for you. I have not talked about the details but I have let people know I am so glad I made the 3 hour drive.

1212,"October 03, 2014","Buying a new vehicle can always be a pain, but this dealership spent every minute doing everything it could to get me into what I ""needed"".  I say that in quotations because I went in looking at one vehicle in particular for my work needs, the bank was not being very helpful getting me into this vehicle.  My salesman presented several viable options to help me out because the bank wouldn't budge, finally working the numbers to where Toyota Motor Credit accepted my purchase (my credit isn't the best, hence the bank problems). My trade-in truck had just encountered severe motor issues. From accepting my trade at a decent price considering the problems, to working long and hard with me literally all day to get me into a new truck.  I've heard great things about toyota trucks recently.  My buddy that recommended Lithia to me has had great experiences with this dealer (after buying 4 vehicles from them, two of them Tundra trucks).  I couldn't be happier with my experience at this dealer, and I've had terrible dealings at dealers in the past 10 years.  I'm going to put this truck to the test and with their service plan I know they're going to be right there with me pushing this truck to its limits!

My trade was a 2003 Dodge 1 ton dually with 340k miles, 5.9 cummins....the motor that is supposedly bullet proof for diesels!  There is a ""trophy"" tundra on their lot, 2007 with 400k+ miles that still drives like it has a few thousand!  If Toyota can build a gasoline truck, and Lithia can help maintain it to exceed what's expected out of a diesel truck, that's something to write home to the folks about for sure!

I highly recommend looking to this dealer for a new vehicle purchase!  I can't vouch for used vehicles because I was shopping new, but I'm definitely going to push anyone I know that's in the market for a vehicle to talk to Kyle Corr first.  He spent the whole day making sure I was satisfied and left in the vehicle I wanted.  I was there from 11am til I drove off the lot in my new truck at 8:30pm.  I left to get food, tow in my trade, and visit the bank a couple of times.  He didn't leave for a break or lunch the whole time he was dealing with me, to ensure that he was available on my return so that my time wasn't wasted.

Definitely a great decision in my book",5.0

I was impressed with his knowledge and sincerity but it was his integrity and honesty that sealed the deal. Bet you never thought you would read those words in reference to a car salesman.

I had a very limited amount of time to get through the entire process and the sales team did their level best to expedite the sale.  The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 in overall satisfaction was as much or more my fault as anyone.  Michael Mizakar and his team made the experience good enough to move my mind away from the business side.  It wasn't necessarily an emotional buy.  I just let my guard down.  I've been buying cars for 35 years and have developed self imposed rules and standards that I let slip by. The dealership met all of their objectives and met my stated objectives.  I just let the term of the loan go too long.  My credit is good enough that I could have been 100% satisfied.  As it is, I have no room for complaint.  It was a pleasant experience.",4.5

Chris and Mike worked to find the exact vehicle we wanted and ""over-delivered"" on their promises; the entire experience, from first call to drive away, was awesome.  Our Highlander not only arrived exactly as ordered, but it arrived almost 2 weeks earlier than expected.  Chris is extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and provides top-notch customer service.  He also provides ""one-stop shopping"", as he is a salesman but also handles all of the financing himself - this makes it really comfortable for the customer.

1273,"March 26, 2014"," I gave a rating of GREAT to all - except one - as Rick was very helpful and friendly and remembered our names and asked us if we would like a drink or if there was anything else he could do for us.  I would recommend all my friends to go visit him if they were looking for a new vehicle.  Everyone at Toyota was very friendly and courteous to us.  I gave a GOOD to the one because as everyone buying a new car we want to think our trade in is worth at least $10,000 - $20,000 but in reality we know it is not worth very much.   As soon as you drive it off the lot it depreciates lots in value.  Everyone wants what they can get for their trade in - no complaints on what we did receive - just being honest!

I appreciate the thoughtfulness in Rick sending a gift basket of cookies to the house.  We have bought new vehicles for the past 20 years and a new RAV4   6 years ago (whick our daughter is now driving) and never has any dealer or sales person been so thoughtful, kind and generous as Rick has to send us the cookie bouquet as a thank you for our business.  When we need to purchase a new vehicle we will definettely check out Toyota and Rick to show us what is available if we are still living in Abilene TX.

We explained what we wanted in vehicle make and features and Andrew delivered.  As we found with our first and second vehicle, not the typical auto dealership.  Andrew made the experience a pleasant visit.  He was very knowledgeable explaining the vehicle features and benefits.  The visit was expedited and streamlined.  It was a very comfortable visit.  We were asked even before leaving with our new vehicle, if we were 100% satisfied and if not, we would begin again with whichever vehicle we desired.  They assured us that if they did not have that perfect vehicle, they would arrange to have it on the lot within a few days.  We truly appreciated that when we spoke, they listened.  They heard what we were saying, instead of telling us what we needed.   We highly recommend Lithia Toyota of Abilene. With our third visit mirroring the first and second visits with Lithia Toyota, we envision no problems leasing a 4th vehicle when this lease term has matured in three years.

1294,"February 10, 2014",I have a long daily commute to and from work and needed to get something more economical to drive than my 2012 Buick LaCross. I had done quiet a bit of consumer research before I walked out of my house to shop for some type of hybrid vehicle.  I went to 4 other dealers before going to Lithia Toyota and basically waited on myself since the sales people either did not know that much about their product or they were not interested in selling a car that day.  Needless to say I went To Lithia Toyota to look at the Prius C Hybrids since consumer research rated them very high and dependable.  I am old school and have had a big carbon footprint in the past when it came to vehicles but I find as I have grown older that I realized that we are not be very diligent in caring for our planet.  With that being said I still was a little skeptical about a vehicle that is half electric and half gasoline engine.  I found a few on the lot that I liked and they were very busy that day but I went to the desk in the showroom and they introduced me to Kyle Corr.   He was very friendly and listened to what I said and listed to what I expected to see happen on this purchase and I mean he truly listened.  We picked a unit out and went for a testdrive where Kyle demonstrated that all the apprehensions that I had about the car's capabilities were not founded at all.  For every question I had he and a physical answer from the car's performance and a verbal answer that let me know he had my best interests in mind.  After our test drive I decided that I would like to buy the care.  Kyle got all of my information and based on what I had told him I wanted payments and trade in value etc. to be he went to work.  I am a difficult customer and Kyle made sure I was completed satisfied with the entire process.  He has a customer who will come back to him time after time because of his attentive consideration to the customers wants and needs and his ability to answer all the many questions I had.

This was my first car so i thought i it would be a scary experience but it was anything but that. The salesman Arnie was very friendly and informative. If he didn't know the answer right off the top of his head someone next to him did. Arnie right off the bat took the car to garage so i could look at it better out of the wind. And when i wanted to test drive the car he went and got the keys before i could say the word Toyota. When my credit check was running he was talking with me and kept me up to date with what is going on constantly. I liked that there was plenty of space for me to get some coffee and a cookie while I waited. And even if i need to there was a place to charge my phone. I liked Arnie he was friendly and got to know him better as a person and he made me feel at home. I told Arnie exactly what I was able to afford and with him and the help of his other sales associates they were able to get me under what I requested. I was also able to get some great discounts when i leased the car. Ron in the finance department really knew what he was talking about. He was able to answer all my questions that I had. He described to me all the paperwork as sometimes it can be confusing. But i wasn't confused at all the whole time. And as soon as i signed the first paper he took the car to get it all cleaned up for me and put window tint on it. He offered me an oil lease plan that was affordable and still kept my payments in my budget that i requested. Ken helped me finish my process to look over the car to make sure all was ok. He hooked up my bluetooth so i could download my music and contacts to my phone. He also explained some more information for me. All were very friendly and helpful during the whole experience,5.0
1316,"December 12, 2013","Both my wife and I had a great experience with Lithia.  We initially bought a Camry from Lithia and dealt with Greg Fenwick.  I was casually shopping around for trucks and decided to call up Greg to see what the Tundra was all about.  He asked for a little information in what I might be looking for in a truck and we decided to meet up that day.  When I got there he already had one pulled around.  It was right up my alley.  Greg was very knowledgable, polite, and not pushy.  

I'm a very inquisitive person, to say the least and during my negotiations with Lithia the staff never seemed put out and worked with me on the prices (trade-in and new vehicle).

I would, and will, recommend Lithia to anyone looking for a Toyota (even if you aren't go check it out).  One of the best car buying experiences I've had thus far.

1342,"October 24, 2013","I was on assignment from Austin in North Texas when my 1997 Toyota 4Runner took it's last tour down a dirt road. I limped from Buffalo Gap into Lithia's Abilene dealership, hoping to have the old girl fixed. They welcomed me and my pup into their comfy waiting room for hours as I had no place else to go. When it was apparent the 4Runner was toast the staff helped me to a hotel for the night and offered to show me any cars on the lot that fit my not-planned-for-car-payment price range. They were very helpful, considerate, and friendly during one of my hardest times on the road.

The next day as I was clearing out my belongings from the 4Runner we ran into Chris Ashley. He helped as I fished camera equipment, dog food, and camping gear from the truck we had affectionately called ""Dimples"" because of old hail damage. We took one last walk through the used lot and happened upon a RAV4 that perfectly fit my needs. Chris was no pressure, hands off, and extremely knowledgeable. When it came time to see if I could even afford the RAV, he worked with us on price and helped me find the best APR possible.

I didn't go to Abilene in search of a new-used car, but I'm sure glad I was there when I needed one. Thanks, Chris! And thanks to the service staff that first long day in the waiting area. The cookies and coffee are much appreciated.",5.0

1350,"September 30, 2013","My sincere and strong message to Lithia Toyota is do whatever you have to do to keep Mr. Craig Beverly in your employee. This experience has convinced us to become loyal Toyota customers for good. From the time we first stepped foot on the lot, we were treated as old friends and never experienced the ""hard sale"" tactics so often accompanying car sales. When I do experience that brand of selling I simply dismiss myself and walk away from the lot, never to return. In this instance, we felt we would make a decision in a few days. That turned into about a month. When we did return, we were again greeted and treated as long time friends. We were not at any time berated for having taken so long and were again treated to a very pleasant experience. Additionally, Mr. Beverly sought our best interest in every respect and did none of the usual nonsense of running off to a ""sales manager"" to get permission to close a deal. We did not have to parade in front of several different people to get sales and financing approval. Craig handled the whole process and he handled it professionally, proficiently and accurately. There were no gimmicks, no sales ""shuck and jive"" stuff, but only straight forward dealing. We were most impressed with the whole process. As I said before, as long as Lithia Toyota keeps Craig we will be back to deal with him for all our automobile needs.",5.0

She made us feel at home and like we had known her for years. The employees over the dealership overall had a wonderful morale and attitude while dealing with us. From the guys outside, to Austin on the inside, as well as the internet manager, Josh, and the finance department. They were all wonderful people. They are fairly priced too! [Something that is hard to find out in West Texas anymore!] My father and I ended up buying a 2005 Dodge Ram 1500 that had 91k miles on it for the fair and wonderful price of $10, 880. 10. We couldn't be more please with the way they presented cleaned-up vehicles. They detailed my truck AND filled up the tank since we live 2 hours away. The internet manager also offered to pay for my gas to come back to the dealership in a week or so to have a small hole in the driver's seat fabric fixed. We felt that since their attitude and the way they handled business, ontop of the fair price for the truck, we didn't even try to bargain the price down, there was no need to!

He met my criteria when looking at vehicles and matched me to something within my budget and driving requirements.  My trade-in vehicle was quoted three to four grand below what Kelley Blue Books listed as the fair trade-in value.  The dealership raised my trade's value about a grand but also added two grand in additional rebates to help my purchase fit into my budget.  My trade-in will probably be listed at a seven to eight grand profit for the dealership, but this place is a business and they are looking to make money to operate.  I needed a quick trade-in and they obliged.

1460,"June 04, 2013","My husband and I went to Abilene ""car shopping"".  We visited Lithia Toyota and were greeted by Omar Mendoza. Omar was attentive to our preferences. He really is one salesman who ""truly cares"" about what his customers are looking far. He NEVER pressured us. We were in complete control of the situation. When we said that a particular feature that we wanted  was not present on a car, he readily focused on cars with the feature(s) that we were looking far. 

Omar was both attentive and professional. His customer skills are exemplary, and there was only the feeling of genuine interest in his clients. This young man made ""car shopping"" a pleasure. I normally do not like to car shop because I either feel pressured or feel like the salesman thinks I am ""a crazy person"" for not agreeing with him or her. Omar and the other staff members that we were introduced to made us feel genuinely appreciated and respected. The only concern was meeting our needs, and Omar readily gave my husband and me the time we needed to talk with each other and look around. He was available when he was needed, but he did not make us feel like he was just following us.

I clearly give Omar and Lithia Toyota my heartfelt appreciation for the courtesy, help, and respect that they showed us. 

Anyone who is looking for a friendly, honest, and respectful salesperson, I sincerely recommend Omar Mendoza.  Another very helpful person that we met was Deborah McCoy. A day or two after we purchased our Camry, I had a question about how a feature functioned (I am not very computer literate), and when I called Deborah to ask my question, she made me feel like it was her pleasure to help me. She clearly explained what I needed to know, and I appreciate her.",5.0

After my oil change with a suggestion from my husband to purchase a new Venza as a Mother's Day gift, I still was unwilling to let go of my 2009.  But Omar Mendoza came to look over my vehicle and started up a conversation.  He pointed out the XLE models similar to my 2009 and preceeded to point out new features that peaked my interest.  He ask me who sold me the 2009 Venza, which was Brian Smith he informed me he was back now in the finance department.  He had Brian come out while he was obtaining keys for me to examine the vehicles of interest.  Brian helped to put me at ease about trading my 2009 and updating.  I had an appointment and had to leave but exchanged information with Omar and I normally would not have returned, but he made me really comfortable during the demonstration of the new features offered.  I returned with my husband after our appointment and selected the right vehicle for us and Omar made the process of the sale go smoothly.  

After the sale he has kept in touch with getting the additional accessories and work completed on my new vehicle and I am very pleased.  My initial purchase of a Venza was great and this experience was equally so. ",5.0

We were starting to consider purching a new vehicle, but needed to waite until after tax season for financhial reasons. He gave us a card and ask if he could call me later. I gave him my Ph. # and he would call every three or four weeks keeping in touch with me. I did not mind this because he was not pushy. The last time he called we agreed to meet the next Sat. at about one to two PM.

When we arrived at Lithia Toyota in Abilene Aaron was busy with a coustomer and we were directed to Phil Underwood. Phil was a very nice young man. After hearing what we wanted in a vehicle,he lead us to a perfect match for us. We drove and looked at a couple of others and setteled on a Toyota Highlander. 

Phil continued the sales process until Aaron Ochoa got finished with his first coustomer.

Aaron got the veh. ready and showed the fearures of the  Highlander to us until we were familiar with it.

Phil and Aaron both were very kind, polite and patient with us throughout the whole process.

My wife Nita and I are 70 years old and have bought several vehicles but have never been treated better.

I believe thats because everyone took the time and effort to make us feel special.

1512,"May 29, 2012","We had initially just come to Lithia Abilene to look at the Sequoia to see if we would possibly like to purchase one in a year or two.  One week later (to the day) we were driving home in a new Sequoia from Lithia Abilene.  We were 100% satisfied with our experience at Lithia, and that experience on this vehicle started and ended with our salesman Omar Mendoza.  I honestly can't praise Omar enough.  We have purchased vehicles from Sewell Cadillac in Plano, Sewell Lexus in Ft. Worth, and Park Place Lexus in Plano, etc. in the past and NOBODY has ever come close to working as hard for our business as did Omar.  He was professional, friendly, polite, courteous, and extremely knowledgeable. He was even polite and gracious when we left the first time without purchasing a vehicle.  He called the next business day just to check in, and then by the end of the week we had made a deal on a vehicle.  We made a deal on a Sequoia that they did not have in stock in Abilene, but was in Odessa.  He asked if we could come the next day (Saturday) and sign paperwork and he would then deliver the car to us the next week.  I was willing to do it, but didn't really want to sign something without seeing the car.  But I didn't even have to tell him this.  Just a short while later he texted me (which is nice - because I get a lot of phone calls and would rather text) and said that the car would be here by 2PM on Saturday.  I was very impressed!!  We arrived at the dealership at 12:30 to start working on the paperwork and the vehicle was already there! The vehicle was exactly what we had wanted - Omar didn't miss a thing.  It even had an option that we had ""hoped"" to get installed.  I am sure he was persistent in getting the vehicle there in that little of time, and I am so very thankful that he did.  I can honestly say that we have never loved a vehicle more than we do our new Sequoia - and our positive experience began with Omar sweating his tail off in the hot Texas sun showing us everything on a black (and VERY HOT) Sequoia.  Having employees is a difficult part of being in business for many different reasons, and I have personally learned that one of those reasons is because they can reflect negatively upon your business and drive customers away.  Omar is the type of person I would want on the front-line of my business dealing with my customers.  He presents a professional and very personable face for Lithia to their customers....and this customer was blessed to have him as our sales rep.

1522,"April 08, 2012","The alternator on our 1985 Land Cruiser died a few miles outside of Abilene in a snow storm while on a cross country trip. When we limped into the service department at Lithia,  Deborah McCoy went to work to help us get back on the road. She phoned every possible parts source for miles around, coordinated getting the part shipped in, arranged complimentary transportation for us to get meals,  arranged a discount on a rental car when it became clear that we'd have to stay in Abilene waiting for the part, and was cheerful and helpful in a thousand ways. We were able to use the wifi to keep up with our work while there. The guys who actually diagnosed the problem and installed the new alternator (don't know their names) also did a great job. We met a few other folks in the dealership, and they were all concerned, friendly, and helpful. Our unplanned stay in Abilene was much more pleasant than we could ever have hoped due to Deb's hard work, problem solving, and support.",5.0

I was very impressed by the speed of the delivery and prep of the car.  The dealers were very helpful (didn't expect anything less) and when the car was delivered to me Chris Ashley went over everything that I needed to know about the new fangled devices.

Without telling the whole story, Kenan and his guys went way above and beyond to help out my elderly parents with a very difficult electrical problem with their Highlander.  If I gave all the details of the service they provided, you would probably not believe me and just think I was being a shill for the dealership.  Let me just say that even though I live in Houston, I am going to travel the 350 miles to Abilene when I get ready to buy my next vehicle.

1531,"March 01, 2012","My car's transmission went out just as I was pulling into Abilene after driving from San Antonio.  After putting over $1500 in the car before I left on the trip, I decided that I could not invest any more money into the car.  

Chris knew that I was in a tough spot because I had to go back home to San Antonio the next day.  He did not pressure my husband or I into making a decision and gave us all the time we needed to decide.  We eventually decided to buy a new car and used our broken car as a trade in instead of fixing it.  Chris worked the deal.  We felt like we were not taken advantage of even though we were in a desparate spot.  We got a good price on the car and on our trade in.  I am very happy with this dealership and am confident that I would not have gotten any better service in my hometown.",5.0

1533,"February 13, 2012","We went to Lithia Toyota to look at used Toyota Tundra trucks. The one used truck that had all my husband wanted was red, which he did not like the color. There was a special on 5 NEW Toyota Tundra trucks like my husband wanted. There was a silver color that we really liked. The price was very good for the new truck, after the special price and our trade-in. We feel that we came out much better buying a new truck, instead of a used/older model truck. Phil was a really nice sales consultant who helped us find just what we wanted and even came in the next day (on his day off) when we decided to make the purchase. He helped us get everything taken care of. He was very friendly, always smiling and laughing. He has a wonderful personality. We really appreciate all his help! Also, we appreciate the help of Kevin Sherman, who was very nice and even let us take the truck that day(by holding our check for a few days). Also, our thanks to Ron Morton who helped us get thru all the necessary paper work as quickly as possible. He was very nice and informative.

So it turns out my daughter is ready to make a purchace of a brand new 4runner from Abilene's Lithia Toyota, and needs my wife to co sign on the note with her. She came home that evening and we talked and she seemed really pleased with the sales person and the way business itself was conducted... The very next day we got up and ready, nice sitdown lunch... Longstory short we ended back at Abilene's Lithia Toyota test driving a couple of used cars just looking at others... Jacob is a patient man. Thanks again Jacob! We haggled, not alot though, I can tell when people are going an exta mile for me. We signed. And we drove home in a brand new used car! All in the same day.

1540,"December 27, 2011","this was our 4th toyota bought at this dealership, out 8th toyota overall. We were
happy with previous purchases until this last car. We traded a 2005 Camry for a 2011
Camry. We were offered 0.0% financing, which we took.We were told by Jim Buckner that
our 2005 Camry trade-in was whole sale $6000.00 for a trade-in. 2 weeks later the 
car was on their lot for $13,575.The sale of the 2011 was ok, trade-in was deceptive.
We filed a claim with Toyota USA. Their reply was ""Dealers set the trade-in amounts
and overall sales experience"", which was a laugh-off.Experience with their Service

Ron Morton handled the financial part and was all the above also.

1555,"August 01, 2011","I went car shopping with the intent to purchase a used Volkswagen Jetta, but I promised my friend that I'd go to Lithia Toyota, to talk to his friend Phil Underwood who sells cars there. Well first thing I noticed was the salesmen here were very attentive, at other lots I had to stand around in the extreme heat to get someone to come and help me out, but here they greeted you immediately. Adam VanZuiden was the salesman who greeted me here, Phil was busy with other customers at that time. So Adam let me test drive a used Toyota Camry. I loved this car, however the new 2011 Camry's were on sale, because the 2012's are about to come out, and it was only about one grand more for a new Camry, so I figured I'd just go with that. I was a bit leery about all the additional stuff you have to pay for with a new car, but somehow Adam was able to get me the payment I wanted, I didn't even expect to get close to it, but I was able to get an extended warranty and lifetime oil changes, too. I love my new Camry, and Adam was so fun to work with. He was making me laugh the whole time. I would recommend anyone who is looking for a new car, but isn't quite sure what they want or what dealership to start with, give Lithia Toyota a try, and talk to Adam, or Phil.
