4,"June 19, 2020","I HIGHLY do NOT recommend this place at all. They pretty much tried to play me and I‚Äôm not happy about it. I only went to this place because of their glorified face book ad stating you can trade in and they will pay off your negative equity, ( which they don‚Äôt they just roll it over like any other place ) then they also stated low monthly payments no down payment all that. Now I understand my car has a lot of negative equity about 6k after trade in. Ok So tell my why my car salesman Jordan Garett asked me what my max monthly payment is and what I‚Äôm looking for and all that is ($350) comes back and tries to sell me a 2020 car for 500$ monthly payment. Mind you He Keeps showing me cars without even telling me what my max range is or if they can even fit my budget. But I‚Äôm thinking , he already knows my budget so I‚Äôm thinking what he shows me will work. Nope & I‚Äôm literally there for 2 hours and at the end the business finance manager comes and tells me there nothing in my range unless I want to not trade in or spend 475$ a month . They basically tried to play me and wasted 2 hours of my time for no reason knowing my budget and what I was wanting. Couldn‚Äôt even get me a used car. So I end up taking my car to Honda in Mckinney and they were straight forward with me and is getting me a car in the end . Not happy , dirty business. ",1.0

After my first test drive, I asked for a car with blind spot detection and siriusXM radio and was brought out a car without the siriusXM radio .  I accepted that car because I could just download the app and stream it but that's not really how I wanted to do it. That's not how I should have to do it. I should be able to have the car I want.

We purchased a well-equipped Soul Exclaim from CENTRAL KIA which to our disappointment had a 3 inch crack on the bottom right corner of the front bumper fascia. We were assured the small flaw on the otherwise perfect car would be fixed once the sale was finalized and we take delivery of the vehicle (we were issued a ‚ÄúWe Owe‚Äù note). By the time we pick up the car the crack increased to a gap filled with black soft glue and held in place with what a sales consultant described, double sided tape. I questioned the seemingly embarrassed CENTRAL KIA sales associate if this was the standard to which repairs were done at the dealership. The management response I received through the sales consultant was: ‚ÄúThis is all we will do for you and acceptable work‚Äù. VERY disappointing!

139,"August 13, 2019","Disappointing experience with this dealer‚Ä¶ $800 dollars and a day wasted!

I had to wait a month to finally write this as I am finally calm enough to do it without using any curse words.

Do yourself a favor and be wary of wasting time with this dealer.  Unless you‚Äôre driving by you may wind up wasting a lot of time and money.  I was an out of state buyer and I regret ever getting involved with this dealer.  Incompetent people with no human decency.

I found a pre-owned vehicle at Central Kia of Plano that I liked.  I got in touch with a sales guy and started going over the numbers and condition of the vehicle.  We settled on the number and I asked him MULTIPLE times to describe ANY damage or issues with the car.  I was told the car was in great condition and had no damage or issues.  I should have seen the red flags when I had to verify some things that I saw in the photos provided to me.  Anyways, I booked my flight to go get the car.  I arrived to find that one of the fenders on the car was previously taken off as it was VERY misaligned.   Only a blind person would not notice this as an issue.  Shortly there after I discovered that the whole rear bumper had touch up paint as well as a misaligned trunk that was all scratched up.  Again, a blind‚Ä¶ or deceiving dealership would not point that out to a customer that would be spending money to come get the car.  They probably though that I would by the car even though its damaged since I already spent the money to fly out.  I wasted about $800 dollars that day and went home empty handed.

The lack of human decency throughout the whole process was terrible but was escalated by the finance manager.   After I pointed out how they really screwed me and had to show them all the damage on the car that they ‚Äúnever noticed‚Äù, I had a simple request.  Can you have someone take me to the airport 10 miles away.  If I can get there ASAP I may be able to get on an early flight to go home.  If I had to wait for uber I would probably miss it.  His response was something like this‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúHey man, it‚Äôs a Saturday, I can‚Äôt have my sales guy drop you off.‚Äù   I was there at 8:30 when the dealership opened and it was not that busy in there with employees wandering around.  At that point I walked out of the dealer ship and started my trip home.

On my way to the airport the sales guy texted me because he wanted to make it ‚Äúright‚Äù.  He said the body guy is coming in to buff out the damage and fix up the car.  Sorry but if you want to make it right, compensate me for the money wasted, I have receipts. I can‚Äôt recover the day wasted.

I didn‚Äôt make a scene, but future customers should know about the type of people they are dealing with at Central Kia of Plano Texas.

154,"June 16, 2019","Central Kia of Plano is a dealership that has no shame. They have taken the greed of car sales to a whole new level. Here is a story that speaks for itself.

   On 3/23/19 I placed a $1,000 ‚Äúnonrefundable‚Äù deposit with Central Kia of Plano on a 2020 SW Telluride w/prestige package. The exterior was white and the interior was dune brown. The deal was for $600 over invoice and a quote of $21,000 on my 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe Sport trade in, after sending pictures. The deal was completed via e-mail. 

   On 5/23/19 I was advised by my salesperson that he was leaving Central Kia for a management position with another car company. Up to this point there was direct communication regarding the delays with the Telluride w/prestige package.  My former salesperson called to advise me he was leaving but strangely I never heard this info from the dealership. In addition, prior to 5/23 Kia Motors Corporate  had advised all Kia dealerships nationwide that they would no longer taking any additional orders on the SW-P because there was a huge backlog at the KMMG. I made several calls to the dealership checking on the status of my order with no additional info. 

   I was assured by my new contact person, Vincent Clementi (a sales manager) that the original deal was still in place and he had my folder with the info. Eventually I was given a deadline of 6/13/19 as a day additional info would be available. I called Mr. Clementi,  who gave me a VIN number and advised my ordered vehicle was 1-2 weeks away. 

   On 6/14/19, the very next, I was contacted by Mr. Clementi and was advised that my ordered vehicle had fallen off the vehicle transporter along with 2 other vehicles and was a total loss. To say I was surprised is an understatement. I asked about seeing photos of the wrecked ordered vehicle but was told no photos would be forthcoming. At this point I became very suspicious and believed a good old bait & bait was being used. Up to this point I had been waiting 13 weeks. 

   I believe Central Kia simply doesn‚Äôt want to sell me the ordered Telluride at the agreed upon price. They still have my deposit. To say that this is unethical business practices is a huge understatement. It has also given me a clear picture of Kia‚Äôs business model and practices - shady & deceptive.  Kia vehicles might be better but their sales methods are old and outdated. 

   In closing, this decision wasn‚Äôt made at the sales or management level but at the ownership level. This lets you know what kind of dealership you are dealing with, an unscrupulous one. I could have gotten a Telluride elsewhere but wasted my time on Central Kia Of Plano.

On 6/17/19 my deposit was refunded to my credit card. There is no doubt that this dealership uses the ""non refundable"" deposit as a ploy and probably receives an ordered vehicle and sells it to the highest bidder and keeps the customer, with the deposit, on the hook. ",1.0

We enjoyed talking to Mark and found him to be pleasant and kind to work with.  He never once pressured us.  After discussion and test drive, we went to a few other dealerships to look at comparable vehicles.  There wasn‚Äôt anything comparable to the price of this Sorento with all of its options, and felt a bit like vultures were after us at the three dealerships we visited.  We returned later in the afternoon to Central Kia.  We met with Mark and Zach again to discuss the Sorento we wanted, and talked to them about past experiences and how difficult it was for me to be in this situation and not expect to be held hostage in the dealership, and how I became physically ill in the past.  Mark and Zach treated my husband and I like royalty from the minute we walked in the door the first time.  At no time ever was I nervous or upset about being there and making a large purchase.  Mark and Zach were fun-loving, yet professional.  The Sorento we test drove was the car I drove home.

We were helped by Zach who made the purchase more smooth & pleasant.  He was very attentive in the way that when I took the Kia Rio SX 2014 for a test drive, he move my personal belongings from my old Sephia to the new Rio SX by placing them as close as possible as they were in my the old car.  A day after we came back to Central Plano Kia to finalize the purchase. I made my numbers clear to Zach, so we started to talk deals out because of financial situation I had to downgrade model from Rio SX to Rio LX 2014. Again! Zach was nice enough to move my personal belongings from the Rio SX to Rio LX by placing them in my new car as close possible as I had them.  Making it easy on my to just sign the papers for my new car & drive off.  Making the most pleasant car purchase I ever experienced. 

Also, Zach Paton went above & beyond 

by removing my old car stereo from the Kia Sephia, which it had an enormous sentimental value for me & giving it to me.  He actually took old car to the back  of the dealer, went inside the hood, & remove it. That was very outstanding of him!!!

Within minutes, Zach called me and got the process started and I was at the dealership just an hour or so later. He got my paperwork done quickly and had me test driving in no time at all. He found a vehicle that I ended up really liking and purchasing that day. The process was so simple and the great staff made it go by very fast. A follow up was done at a later time to make sure I was happy with my purchase. With service like this, I will definitely be returning to purchase my next vehicle!",5.0

I believe Zach is an extremely important asset to Kia of Plano!,4.4
257,"May 21, 2014","A++ service from start to finish. My experience couldn't have been any better as it was made not just easy, but FUN. Mark Simbulan is a HUGE asset to Central Kia of Plano. He has people skills. He's knowledgeable, fun, and he put me at ease about the whole car buying experience. I would recommend him to anybody interested in buying a Kia. I was in a car accident over a month ago and my car was totaled, however, I had been in the market for a new car and a Soul was on the top of my list. I was given a Nissan Cube as my rental and not looking forward to driving it, but over time I began to get used to it. I started my test driving with my 1st test drive being the Soul and I did not like it at all. It was so different from the VW Jetta that I had been driving for over 10 years. It was too high off of the ground and it felt like I was driving a shoe on wheels. I was so disappointed. I drove tons of other cars afterwards...I was looking for the perfect hatch, roomy, sporty, fun, a pop color, safe, etc...After a couple of weeks, I went to another Kia dealership, drove another 2014 Soul and again much to my dismay, did not like it. Back to the daily grind of test driving more cars. Then one day last week, I began to look at used cars and found a 2013 Mazda on truecar.com and I inquired about it. I heard from Mark Simbulan the next day. On Friday 5/16/14, I went to look at the Mazda, walked into the dealership and on the showroom floor saw a red Soul Exclaim with a sunroof and I opened the car and sat inside and I knew that was the car I was going to buy. Also, when I drove the souls before, the seats felt uncomfortable to me. Anyway, I got used to driving the box aka Cube after a month, so the strangeness that I felt before in the Soul fell away and things like being raised inside of the car felt more natural. I made a complete circle as I started out at Central Kia in Plano and ended at Central Kia of Plano. I was nervous about going in and purchasing a new car, but I did my homework, had my true car certificate, knew what I wanted to spend and my experience couldn't have gone any smoother or been made any easier, plus Mark Simbulan and Zach Paton made the whole experience super fun which put me at ease. The night before I purchased the Soul, I went by the dealership and was able to take the car for a spin and was given a demo. Yesterday, 5/20/14, when I made the purchase, Mark gave me the total demo of the car. Another thing about Mark, he has a great way of explaining things. Everything made sense from start to finish. The finance guy Norman kind of tied everything together and completed a wonderful experience. I cannot speak anymore highly of Mark Simbulan, Zach Paton, and Norman.",5.0

259,"April 23, 2014",My daughter was recently in an accident and her car was totaled.   She wanted an Optima so we began to look at various dealers in the area.  We went to Central against my better judgement since I had dealt with them before and was extremely unhappy with the experience but I thought time had passed and maybe things had improved .  Boy was I wrong.  We went in and met with Reggie and test drove an Optima.  My daughter gave him some information but we specifically told them do not run the credit until we are sure we can make a deal.  I am aware that credit inquiries can adversely affect one's credit.  We talked with them but were unable to come to an agreement so we left.  We went to two additional Kia dealerships and at the last one we were making a deal on a car and they ran my daughter's credit report.  Come to find out Central had run her credit through THIRTY different banks!!!    This lowered her credit and she was almost unable to buy a car.  I later found out that that is a scam they run so that you have to return to their dealer to  make a deal.   I was so infuriated.  My daughter is a responsible your adult and was in a bind to find a car since hers was totaled through no fault of her own.  Central is also famous for a bait and switch.  They advertise a car and claim they have it but when you get there it is gone.  Then they try to talk you into another one for more money.  This was what they did to me the first time I went to them a few years ago.   The staff was rude also on both occasions.  My advice STAY AWAY from Central Kia!!!!!  ,1.0
260,"September 23, 2013","I went to have oil change but instead I left that place very disappointed with the type of customer service they have. A guy named Eduardo asked me how many miles my car had and he started with his speech selling the 50,000 miles maintenance, I was aware of that but I did not want to do it at this time and told him that, Oh boy that is when my nightmare started, he told me that according with his system I have not been doing oil change since March ( no true ) I went somewhere else. Then continue selling tire rotation, I told him I have him for free at Firestone where I bought my tires recently and he told me I should go there for my oil change. Next he says, looks like you are not planning on keeping this car just the way you treat it. Who in the xxxx is him to make the comments , he does not know anything about me or the cars I had in the past. Finally, he took my car keys and told me to come back in 1 1/2 or 2 hours that my car will be ready. I told him that when I called the Dealer to make an appt, they told me that it will take an hour not 2hours then he said if I could not wait that time I better take my business some else which I did it. Bottom line, he was very rude just asking all those questions and comments. If I request Oild change that all I need, I don't have to tell evrybody the reasons why I can't do the other service or tell them my Financial situation. Very disappointed and I will not go back again to that place.",1.0

I am very happy to say that his attentiveness to give us that personal touch was very heart felt.  It is nice to know that there are still people out there that take pride in their job and the human kind.  We need more people like Lawrence Curry, because people like him are far and between.  I hope that the CEO of this company will read this and know that they have a gentleman they cannot afford to lose ever, because if they take him for granted they themselves will lose a real human being that has real feelings and does care what the customer thinks.

They had about 8 different Kia Souls listed at $15,319 on cars.com they also had some on their own website which was listed as a base model automatic transmission.  When she told me about this I decided to give them a call just to confirm the price and availability.  When they answered the phone I asked the person which was Norman about the different vehicles and in specific a black one because mi wife had her heart set on that one.  Norman on the phone confirmed that they had those vehicles available at that price and they indeed where automatic. He then asked me when we were interested in purchasing the vehicle; I told him that if it was that price we would be there before they closed for business that day.  He said when you come in just ask for Norman.  We then got in our car to make the long drive from Arlington to Plano just to get there and find out that the Kia Souls I had asked about where all manual transmission and they can set us up in an automatic for $17,200.  Talk about a shock to us when in their advertising was one thing and there it was something completely different.  My wife and I were really disappointed and we just decided to leave.

276,"February 18, 2013","I decided to do business with Kia of Plano because of the professionalism of Mr. Blake Box and the ""I can't quite attitude of Mr. Stephen Cantrelle.

I am proud to say that both Blake and Stephen calmed both my skepticism and fears. He made my wife and I feel that he understood our situation and that he had a stake in our decision making.

 I believe Kia of Plano have a great team and this great experience flows down from Kia's Leadership (i.e. GMs and Manager). I believe that Kia's Leadership is rooted in a simple idea that we have a stake in one another, and that what binds us together is greater than what drives up apart, and that if enough people (customers and Kia's staff) believe in the truth of that proposition and act on it, then we might not solve every customer problem, but we can get something meaningful done and sell you a great KIA OPTIMA...

We let him know how much we were looking to spend and what kind of vehicle we were looking for, and we were quickly led to the lot to look inside and drive multiple vehicles. Mike pointed us toward a Kia Forte, because of its size and features, but also because it had a rebate available, which would help us meet our financial goal. Mike was very helpful and knowledgeable, going through all of the features of the vehicle, as well as hospitable to my wife, son and I. From there we met Brian Bauer, who is the floor manager of CKP. Although floor managers have a reputation of being very pushy and forceful, we received the exact opposite with Brian. He was very understanding of our needs, and worked extremely hard to get the deal done so that we were both pleased. The entire negotiation process was very smooth and professional, as well as painless! We never felt like we were getting the run around or being deceived.

283,"November 07, 2012","I purchased a KIA Optima Hybrid 2 month ago at CENTRAL KIA of Plano and discovered a few days ago that the fuel mileage advertised on the window sticker was incorrectly posted and adjusted by the EPA. Since the gas mileage dropped KIA elected to reimburse customers for the inconvenience of false advertisement. More than 900,000 cars (35% of all sold between 2011 and 2013) from KIA and the sister Hyundai are involved including Elantra, Tucson, Sportage, Rio and Optima. A total of 13 models are involved. Lawsuits are filed and if successful will give me the option to back out of the purchase which I did not intend until I talked to the ‚ÄúFLOOR MANAGER‚Äù of CENTRAL KIA. 

I visited CENTRAL KIA to gather more information, express my concerns and learn what CENTRAL KIA would offer effected customers. I realized in a rude way the ‚ÄúFLOOR MANAGER‚Äù does not consider himself a ‚ÄúKIA dealer‚Äù and defined his work as:‚Äù‚Ä¶.I don‚Äôt touch those cars including EPA stickers. KIA is putting those stickers in‚Ä¶..‚Äù On the flip side the stickers are currently being replaced at the dealership with the LOWER GAS MILEAGE ones. Adding the words ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶this is what I do for you‚Ä¶the difference is fine print‚Ä¶ and pointing at the stickers in his showroom cars is what CENTRAL KIA expresses is their responsibility. While initially trying to convey very limited knowledge of the issue, to stating at the end that I don‚Äôt know everything there is to know about the subject and my information is only partially correct. 

Customer service is not amongst the stronger skills of the FLOOR MANAGER and it is highly disappointing to be viewed as consumer with limited comprehension. Not a single word of apology or assistance. ",1.8

I filled out the necessary information online to get started in my search for a good used/new vehicle.  I found that Central Kia of Plano was rated one of the best, and since I must do most, if not all, of my business via electronic means, I needed a dealership willing to work with me.

It was only an hour or two before I got a call from Richard Salazar, of Central Kia, who was very willing to help me out.  The time I first filled out the application online, to the time I drove away in my brand new 2013 Kia Forte was less than 48 hours, and only because I was en-route from El Paso to Dallas on a delivery.  

I had a very pleasant experience with this Dealership, and would recommend them to anyone!  I love my new car, though I haven't had much time to drive it, as I drive for a living, I got the price I wanted, the payment I could afford, and with the down-payment I was able to afford as well.  

The entire deal was done as I was on my way to Dallas.  All I had to do was show up to the dealership, sign the necessary paperwork, and drive away in my brand new car.

Dealing with Central Kia of Plano has been a pleasure, and I will make all future purchases through this dealership.

He told my wife he would locate one and call her about coming in on Saturday.  In the meantime, we learned through Kia's webiste that you can only get leather seats in the most expensive configuration, which is not available with a manual at all.

I learned that Central Kia was listed as an affifliated dealership through my credit union, and saw on their website that they had a manual Plus in the right color with manual transmission.  I sent an email request and Bryan Bauer responded pretty quickly.  He confirmed the vehicle, the dealer options, and offered it at a price consistent with what my credit union told me to expect.

Meanwhile Bryan went the extra mile to ensure that I was moving along as quick as possible and when it came time to sign the final papers was good enough to come to my home, explain everything to my wife, and made sure everything got done. Central Kia now has a customer for life and I'll go there before anywhere else as well as let everyone know what a good deal and customer service you get at Central KIA.",5.0
298,"November 02, 2011","Bryan was extremely professional and friendly. I really enjoyed working with him. He was honest and worked with me on gathering financing options as well as helping me select a car that was within my budget and satisfied my needs. I had fun with Bryan. He put up with my goofy humor which is always a plus for me :)

Stewie (sorry don't remember his last name) in finance was great too, enjoyed speaking with him and considering him very knowledgeable and professional. I especially appreciated the way he worked with my mom who was there as well.

I would definitely recommend this dealership to others.",5.0
299,"October 28, 2011","I purchased a pre owned Kia Sportage here two weeks ago but was in a terrible car accident due to a drunk driver that ran a red light. My car was totaled and Bryan Bauer and Stewart in the financing department did an AMAZING job helping not only get me into a new car, but they helped me work through all the kinks, answer questions and made me feel like an appreciated and valued customer. I would recommend this dealership to ANYONE! I loved my experience. ",5.0
300,"October 24, 2011",Good dealership.  I had the opportunity to browse models on the floor by myself before being approached by a salesperson.  This allowed me to look at the model I was interested in on my own without feeling rushed.  Bryan was laid back and answered all of my questions.  No pressure experience.,5.0
301,"October 23, 2011","Bryan was exceptionally friendly, outgoing and knowledgable. He had me and my partner at ease as soon as we met him. He was honest and up front with his negotiations and number crunching. He didn't seem like the typical ""pull a fast one and take advantage of the customer"" type salesman that one expects to have when they buy a car. He had an answer to most of my questions, and found someone who did know the answers when he wasn't sure. I completely respected that. He was courteous and upbeat and made the who experience fun and very enjoyable. I will encourage my friends and neighbors who are looking for a car to go find Bryan at Central Kia of Plano.",5.0
302,"October 19, 2011","Well Byran Jackson just went above and beyond the call of duty to make my sisters and I happy in the vehicle we wanted!!! 

He worked hard to get us a Kia Soul in the color and style we wanted and most importantly at a price we could afford!!! 

After looking around for almost two weeks for the perfect car we stopped looking when we talked to Bryan!! 

When we were waiting for all the paper work to go through everyone was sssooo friendly, we had a wonderful car buying time!!!

I would recommend this dealership to anyone & everyone. 

If you don't have a car, then walk, run or take the bus to Central Kai of Plano today......

304,"September 28, 2011","I wanted a specific color and options on a 2012 Soul, but I couldn't find any in the DFW area by searching dealer sites.  One dealership e-mailed me numerous times, trying to get me to come in, even though he confirmed he didn't have what I wanted.  James Bowers at Central Kia went a step further.  He looked into what was due to arrive at their dealership and discovered that what I wanted was coming in within a few days.  I had an extremely pleasant experience working with him, Bryan Bauer, and Steve in finance as I made arrangements to buy the vehicle.  I believe Bryan Jackson helped as well.  Every employee in the dealership was friendly and helpful.  My car arrived sooner than expected and it was even better than I hoped.  After the sale was done, I met with Lawrence Curry when I picked up the car, and I had a nice conversation with him about my experience with Central Kia.  I had purchased my previous vehicle there in 2008, when the dealership was under different management.  The experience back then was much different from this time.  One thing I immediately noticed was that the salesmen weren't standing around on the front steps like vultures.  Inside, everything was clean and open...unlike 3 years before when all the sales cubicles were in the middle of the showroom floor.  Steve worked hard to get the best deal for me, which was even better than the pre-approved offer I came in with.  That was much different from 2008 when the finance manager told me to lie about what I earned when the finance company called the next day (I didn't, but I did tell on him).  I have already recommended Central Kia to several friends.  The ONLY thing they could've done better was give me a giant dancing hamster.  
(And if you're thinking about getting a Soul, buy one!  I traded in an '07 Mustang and love how the Soul is roomier, rides smoother, has better visibility, and will definitely get better mileage.) ",5.0

309,"August 04, 2011","I was trying to get an economical, comfortable, eco friendly car to replace my trade-in vehicle that was now very difficult to get in & out of as well as not having the most comfortable seat since my stroke altered my left leg mobility. That same stroke resulted in my credit rating suffering, so I wasn't sure if I could qualify for a loan. I was up front about that & invited to come in & talk. I was treated repectfully, not like a ""second class citizen"" as another dealership had acted. Emad & Bryan FOUGHT for me, got me qualifed, then got a better interest rate to better meet my budget. Emad made sure I had the vehicle with the amenities that made me comfortable. He searched inventory & altered a Sportage for me. I NEVER has a dealership so friendly and caring(bought my first car in 1965). The trade-in department was very fair. This whole process probably took 12 man hours & 2 work days to get everything ""just right"" and everyone in the dealership was friendly & worried that I was there ""so long"", was I being helped, etc. They collectively made sure I had someone to keep me company & offered cold water every time. The team of Bryan & Emad were awesome. Emad promised he would make me ""jump for joy"" and stroke or no stroke, I literally did, as thanks. They both offerd sincere hugs, and I was delighted to hug back. The atmosphere of the entire dealership was welcoming and caring about the client, as well as very professional.   ",5.0

311,"July 08, 2011","Having been to other dealerships and not having a good experience, I was thrilled with my experience at Central. I told Norm what we were looking for and what we were willing to pay (how much down and how much we'd finance) and they came within a couple of hundred of our mark.

The sales person at the other dealership could not tell me much about the vehicle we were looking at but Norm was able to answer every question we asked. I had filled out an online info sheet and Norm called me as we drove to the dealership, so I had a contact when we arrived. We were treated like valued customers and not just people shopping for a vehicle.

The atmosphere was sort of laid-back, we could laugh and smile with everyone there, including the finance guy, Ralph (I think that is his name). It was the most enjoyable car buying experience I have ever had!",5.0

313,"July 01, 2011","Based on telephone contact only. Called to request price, as directed by listing, of 2005 Toyota Camry. Placed first call yesterday, person was pleasant but not aware of this car.  He stated he would call me with info.  No return call.  Today I called Irving dealership and the person who answered call was impossible to understand - even when asked to repeat. What I did understand was that he was not familiar with this vehicle.  So, I called Plano again and spoke with Lawrence who stated he was a manager and that he would call me back with price.  He was not aware of the car.  I was explicit that I did not want solicitation calls and Lawrence stated he would not give my number to anyone.  After he persisted I told him I was looking at Camry for my son.  Awhile later, I was left a voice mail by Craig stating, ""My manager asked me to call you to see if I could help you find a car for your son"" (still no price).  I returned the call to Craig and left a strong voice message 'that I did not need help to find my son a car, and only wanted the price of the 2005 Camry'.  In response, Craig left me a voice message to the effect that 'he thought the car was at the Lewisville dealership and I could call there'. Craig did not even leave the Lewisville contact number.  My next call was to Corporate Kia in Irvine, CA.  I explained my quest and am waiting for a call with the price.  The woman I spoke with was a very good listener and stated that she would try to get the price and call me back....  Evidently, Central Kia is not concerned with customer service if you want a car other than a Kia and are not willing to be harassed by sales staff.  I am actually considering the purchase of a Kia in the near future, but will not do business with the Central Kia group.  Corporate provided me with the owner's name and I may try to track him down to complain. I wonder if the 2005 Camry actually exists!!!

314,"June 29, 2011","Long story short... My 3 month old Sorento has had some mechanical issues.  The engine malfunction light came on, my AC starts blowing HOT air when sitting in traffic (moving at 10 mph or less), the latch on the passengers side rear seat sticks and there was a recall on a front spring.  Scotty Williams has treated me like a child (or a woman who doesn't know anything) every time I have had to deal with him.  Engine malfunction light came on due to a bad part.  When I asked Scotty what the part was, he said ""its a variable blah, blah, blah valve""  Really?  Then the best part was when I told him about my AC blowing HOT air while slow in traffic, he proceeds to tell me the car is designed to shut the compressor off to keep the engine from over heating.  When I said I wished someone had told me that before I bought a Kia, he said, ""all cars do that, all makes and models""!  Okay, now I am just furious.  I have owned a lot of cars in my life and I know other people who drive different cars and not one of them has ever done that.  HE really thinks I am an idiot!  Okay, maybe I am because I did buy a Kia after all and I did go into the sales office to talk to a sales manager about my (unhappy) experiences so far.  Bryan Jackson met me at the door, listened to what I had to say, agreed that the AC should not be shutting down or blowing HOT air because traffic is slow.  Bryan then tells me to follow him because he is going to make this right!  I asked how he was going to make it right and he told me that he was going to put me in a brand new Sorento with a better engine!  I said there was no way he could do that and he assured me that he could work miracles.  He told me my payments would be the same and all would be fine.  My perception at that point was that he was offering excellent customer service.  Ha!  They did not want to show me any numbers or details on how they would make this work and when Bryan had a salesman bring the details to me, they had a plain white sheet of paper on top with only a place for me to sign (agreeing to the terms).  I asked the sales guy what it was and he said ""oh, its just a copy of some details for the file, no big deal"".  Thank goodness I lifted the cover sheet because there I saw the details/numbers.  Bryan was making a heck of a deal for Central... he could have won Sales Manager of the month if he had closed that deal.
Not only were they charging me more than MSRP + Destination fees, he was giving me almost $10,000 less on my new car ""trade in"" than what I paid 3 month's ago.  I know cars depreciate but, $10,000 in 3 month's?  Ouch!!
Long story short, Bryan had me believing that he was swapping my (potential lemon) for a new car but they used deceptive measures to do that.
To make matters worse, one recall item (the front spring) that was supposed to be fixed was not but, Scotty told me everything was good to go.  Thank goodness I read the service paperwork when I got home, otherwise I would have thought every thing was done.
Now I look at the BBB website and this dealership has a F rating with 151 complaints in 3 years compared to Huffines Kia in McKinney who has a A rating with 1 complaint in 3 years!  Where you gonna go for a new car?",1.4

319,"July 06, 2010","Bought my car here 5 years ago and had a good experience and have been pleased with parts department in the past but now am having a horrible experience with their service department.  Needs a new alternator and 140 amp fuse.  Estimated total is $1006 but I haven't received my car yet so hopefully won't be more.  Worst part is delay.  Took my car in on a Thursday and they still do not have the parts for it on Tuesday.  I have had to call daily for updates (they have not called me since the first call with the estimate nearly 24 hours after dropping it off)and the story has a changed a bit every time.  On Friday they said parts should be in on Monday or Tuesday, I even verified that they were going to be open Monday July 5th.  Finally on Tuesday they admit to me that the order was not even placed until Tuesday.  Also, they say they can't get the right sized fuse and need to replace the entire holder ($171 part).  I would think the dealership should be able to find a part like a fuse for their own car.  Feel like I am being taken advantage of but as my rental car bill continues to climb just want it all over and done with.

320,"March 04, 2009","Incident = The entire story of our nightmare with Central Kia is way too long to type. But the shorter story is: My daughter\'s 2006 Kia Spectra was towed to Central Kia and it just stopped.  After being at their dealership for 23 days, and everyday being told \""don\'t worry we\'ll find out what is wrong with your car and everything is under warranty.\""  Everyday they would call saying they replaced this and that, which I never authorized,but still couldn\'t get the car to run.  Finally I\'m told it\'s the computer system and that it went out because a stero speakers that were professionally put in her car.  They had been there for months ahead of time.  So, now everythig they replaced I\'m being told I have to pay for in the amount of $2,200.  Many calls to Rusty Wiley where he was the rudest and I could tell trying to rip us off.  I finally go to pick up the car, give the girl my credit card and she gave me a receipt saying the car is totally under warranty you don\'t owe u
s a thing.  Great I said and the car was brought around and I left. 1 hr later I get threatening phone calls from Rusty Wiley saying he is going to put me in jail and to pay them or bring the car back.  I called, left a message, and told him what happen.  You won\'t believe this, but Central Kia then stole my daughter\'s car off the parking lot from the hospital she works for.  We didn\'t know it was Central Kia, called the cops filed a report.  I get home and have another call from Rusty Wiley saying \""your car is done and ready to be picked up\"".  ???  We already picked the car up several days earlier.  The Dallas police were wonderful and retrive the car back to us from Central Kia.  The people that work there didn\'t even want to give my car to the police.  They were told they would be arested, so they gave the car to the police.  I then get a law suit in the mail.  How can they sue us?  I was given the car, told it was all under warranty, and a paid reciept.  Please all
  of us that have been ripped off my Central Kia need to work together to close them down.  I\'ve called the news here and they are calling me back for the story details.  We need to protest out front of their store, don\'t let this ever happen to anyone else.  
Damage Resulting = Not only did they steal my daughter\'s car, this is grand auto theaf as they didn\'t do any paper work to pick up the car the car is in very bad shape.  Dash and panel damaged, wires every where and the stick shift messed up from them towing the car.

My daughter is very ill and suffers from colitis.  She has been in the hospital twice because of the stress from their actions.  I\'m a single Mom who suffers from MS, and no money.  I need help.
