28,"February 11, 2020","J.R. Melero, Service Adviser has provided several years of continuous, outstanding service whenever I obtain factory service or maintenance on my Jeep Grand Cherokee.  
J.R. always keeps me informed on the repair status/progress of the vehicle by calling my cell phone or physically tracking me down in the Sunland Park facility.  
He will schedule the service or repair as soon as needed and then always makes sure the vehicle is completed on the scheduled date and time.  Often the repair is completed the same day the vehicle enters the shop.  Scheduled services such as oil changes and tire rotations are most often both completed in less than 90 minutes.
When I have been on an extended trip out of the state of Texas and had an issue with my Jeep in a remote area, I have called him and he provided excellent guidance on what to do.
On one occasion after normal business hours and after the van shuttle service was closed he drove my wife home when our vehicle had to be kept overnight.
When a rental car is needed he personally makes sure it is available, priced fairly and it is a good replacement.
In over sixty years of driving, J.R. is the most professional Service Adviser that I have ever had the pleasure of working with.  He is the very best, he totally understands world-class customer service and practices it every day.",5.0

43,"October 16, 2019","On October 7, 2019 I arrived at Sunland Park Jeep without an appointment or reservation for an oil change and tire rotation.  Brian Crowe was my service adviser and said the service would take approximately 1-1/2 hours.  I stayed in the immaculate customer waiting area and also took a look at the new Jeep models, including the pickup truck, on the showroom floor.

After only 60 minutes Brain came to the waiting area and told me my Grand Cherokee was completed and ready to go.  Great response time especially considering that I did not have an appointment.

I should add that J.R. is usually my service adviser when I make an appointment for warranty work and he also provides outstanding customer service.  He always meets the estimated completion time and and will make frequent visits to the customer waiting area to keep me informed on the status of the warranty work.

61,"August 01, 2019","I recently (within the last 48 hours) bought a slightly used dodge charger, it had 2600 miles on it. car looked great, test drive was good.  was not offered much as far as normal dealer services such as they did not even detail the car before I left.  The car had damage that I found after getting home,  the damage had to have been obvious to the dealership and I believe they took steps so a simple test drive would cover it up, communication between customers and employees was terrible.  they use all the car salesmen tactics and when you call them out on it they just keep pouring them on and telling lies.  I regret ever going here and will not go back.  do not recommend. ",1.2

74,"June 10, 2019","BUYERS BE AWARE!!!!!!! Found what I thought was a nice used truck on car guru at this dealership. Contacted the dealership about my non working trade. I live 4hrs away in the next state. They promptly got back in touch. Told me to bring my trade. Brought my trade in tow. We had an agreed amount on trade. The truck I went to see was not cleaned for viewing. When asked why. The response was idk by Rose. But she knew I was on the way for at least 4hrs prior to see the truck. Since it’s cosmetic. I let that go. The used car manager (Luis), sales person (Rose), and a tech from the mechanic Made claims of putting it up on rack and inspected the truck.  I was told by (Luis) if any issues  were to arrive from the truck, he would “help” me. I should have got this in writing. Because after the purchase. On my way home truck broke down before I got home. Had to wait for a tow truck to pick it up. Took it to a transmission shop. It needs a rebuild costing $2500-$2900 if major components are damaged. I have contacted Luis and he said he will help and never got back to me other than to say you signed the papers and I have to get it towed back there 4hrs away in order for him to help me instead of offering to assist in fixing the truck. Even accused me of doing something to the truck I just bought. This was on June 3rd. It broke down the same day. When asked to help pay for the tow since I never made it home and do not possess the title. He said he would Ask his Gm and get back to me in 5 mins. Never called back and won’t return my calls. These people are low down shady individuals. Who will lie to you and have others there lie to get you for your money. Then treat u like your worthless. You would think a place as established as this and sells 70k vehicles as they do; would have inspected their stock and not sell trash to their customers. expecting the customer to take the blow. I even asked Luis to meet me half way. No response from management or anyone to ask if I’m ok or need anything. I would not trust them. They lied about everything to convince me to buy this truck. I should have trusted my gut. Don’t make the same mistake as I did. I’m African American as well. I’m hoping that had nothing to do with the bad deal I have been given or the treatment I have received from this dealership. I have given them ample opportunity to make this right. But they will not do so. They are waiting out to just stiff me on this purchase. Don’t trust this place!!!! ",1.0

90,"September 15, 2017","I requested information on a vehicle they have for sale an a trade-in I have. Recieved a call from a sales man, we agreed on meeting at 7PM. I got there a little earlier 630ish and the sales man was busy.  He excused himself from the customers he was helping for about 5m took me to see the car and asked me for my trade-in keys so they could value it. He then asked me to wait in the lobby till he finished with the customers he was with.  Long story short I was there for over an 1hr till I decided it was enough since salesman nevert came back or anyone.  I went to look for the salesman which found chit chatting with other sales personnel.  I asked him what had happened with the trade and the seeking car.  He replied by saying he was sorry that they were missing a "" team"" and they hadn't gotten to any numbers.  I told him ok, thankyou I've been here for an hour please call me instead when you have the numbers. All in all they never did anything but waist 1hr and 30m of my time.  Apparently they must not want to sell vehicles.  I've bought many autos and never have I experienced that type of service.  If a salesman is busy he directs you to someone else to help you while he is done.  Just plain worst service ever coming from the largest Dodge dealership in El Paso!  I will never go back...",1.4

After multiple appointments where the person I was scheduled with was never actually at work, condescending statements such as ""don't break a nail,"" and someone actually breaking the mirror trying to prove that it wasn't broken, I've already had enough of this dealership.

93,"May 18, 2015","This dealership deserves a 5-star rating because of the excellent salesman who helped get us our new 2015 Jeep Cherokee. From beginning to end, our salesman, Gerald Jinkerson, gave us his upmost attention, taking the time and effort to figure out exactly what vehicle was best for us and for our budget. Throughout the entire process, Gerald was patient, honest, and genuinely wanted to help us get what we wanted. He pushed for us to get the best deal that we possibly could. He truly did everything to make us feel that Sunland Park Chrysler Dodge Jeep RAM wanted and appreciated our business.

95,"February 25, 2015","I bought a 2013 Jeep Wrangler Limited in February 2013. With it I purchased the 3 year GAS AND GO plan with the Synthetic Oil changes for $750. The first two times I had my vehicle serviced, they put in regular oil instead of synthetic. Two other times, they did not wash the car after the oil change, which they are supposed to do.  I also got three details with the GAS AND GO plan. When I went to pick up my jeep this past Saturday, the jeep was supposed to be detailed.  Instead, the exterior detail wash was no better than taking it through a regular car wash.  When I told the Asst Service Manager about it and he agreed, he stated, ""thats pretty much the detail you get with the service agreement."" I asked him to speak to the Service Manager and get back to me.  That was three days ago. I have not heard back. I have other complaints about their service, but I think you get my drift. Even though I paid $750 for this service plan and still have a year left, I am walking away from it rather than leave my jeep in their care. I cannot trust them with any of their services. I really have to wonder if they are even putting synthetic oil in it. These guys are a big disappointment. I am not even going to waste my time calling them back. It would do no good.",1.4

Then I spoke to Javier Ochoa ""Chuy"" and upon explaining to him what I had already explained on the phone he still ran my credit report knowing that I automatically was disqualified. I explained to him that I understand sales antics, but professionally, they could just be honest like I was with them. He proceeded to state, ""That's the way the cookie crumbles"". Very unprofessional. I get that I have a poor credit score and I am working on making it better, but to be rude and unprofessional is completely unnecessary.",1.0

98,"January 15, 2014","We had an absolutely horrible experience, due to the incompetence of the new Sunland Park Chrysler/ Jeep/Dodge Ram New Car Sales Manager, Ivan Ochoa.  This dealership operates under the philosophy of just get them in here and then we’ll rip them off!  We wasted so much of our time going back and forth on a deal.  We wanted to trade in our vehicle towards the purchase of a brand new top of the line vehicle. We were only asking for what NADA and Kelley Blue Book listed as the trade-in value, they reluctantly finally agreed, but wanted us to buy the one they had on their lot which was not even close to the color we wanted and the second was used as a demo by the dealership owner and had over 3K miles on it, but they were selling at MSRP! They finally offered the option of a dealer trade and they found exactly what we were looking for in Phoenix, AZ, but they wanted to charge $1,076 to ship it here. We finally agreed it would be a deal if they paid half of the shipping, and they said absolutely not and allowed us to leave over $538, even though we were willing to pay MSRP on the new vehicle.  Two days later we called our sales associate back and asked if we could just order one, we were told no problem and they would still give us what was originally agreed for our trade.  We asked if we had to leave a vehicle there that day, and was told no, but we could if we wanted.  We drove the trade-in vehicle to the dealership in case they wanted to look at it once again.  Once there, they had the invoice of the total cost, which was higher than what is listed on the Jeep website.  When questioned they just stated that Jeep probably hasn’t updated their website, but what they had was the correct price (above the Jeep build price).  Now that we’re there and have agreed to pay the new car price, they again reiterate that absolutely yes, the trade-in price is still good and it’s in the system as such.  At that time they explain that we do have to leave our trade-in along with the keys and title before they can write the contract. We explain that we only brought one vehicle and would have to drive back home to get another so we have a way home once we leave the trade-in. Instead of offering us a ride home they say, “OK how long will it take you”? We travel back home pick up another vehicle and go back to the dealership who said they would have all the paper work ready to go once we returned.  Now we have wasted another two hours in addition to the three we wasted two nights prior.  When we returned to the dealership we were informed by our sales associate that the Sales Manager is reducing his offer by $1,500 for our trade-in. We are of course irate, and ready to walk out.  The Sales Associate offers for us to speak with the Sales Manager. Once the Sales Manager comes out of his little hole and introductions are made he asks, “What can I help you with”? I couldn’t believe it, the idiot is doing everything he can to manipulate us and rip us off and asks that question! I told him he can start by giving us the amount mutually agreed to for our trade-in. He then starts to explain that because he cannot sale our vehicle until our new one arrives, the vehicle will depreciate over the next 6-8 weeks (this is a lie, I find out later).  I am furious and ask why we weren’t told this prior to us driving back and forth to our home this morning. He defiantly states, “Ma’am I am not raising my voice and I do not expect you to raise yours”. That’s when we started to just pick our items to leave and he just walked away.  This incompetent individual working for this dealership is going to be the cause of a lot of lost sales.  He definitely needs customer service training.  I work for the Department of Defense and I am in the process of informing leadership of the deceptive business practices of this dealership, which I told him I would do as I departed that day.  I can just imagine how many Soldiers this dealership has ripped off.  I have questioned several and found out that yes, they too had a bad experience or think they were ripped off, but too embarrassed to state so. It is poor business practices to employ an incompetent, customer service challenged, Sales Manager making decisions that will either make or break a dealership.  I am in management with the Defense Department and would definitely investigate further on this employee. I would imagine ours is not the first problem nor will it be the last.  Please be advised:  I have shared this story with every auto review site, the Army and the manufacturer.",1.0
99,"September 02, 2013","Where do I begin? WIth the sales rep that, when we decided we did not like the initial offer and said we were going to walk away, did not even ATTEMPT to dissuade us, and it was only when the sales manager was brining us our keys that the deal was improved? Maybe it should be about their AWFUL service department, who can't even manage to do a decent detailing job after two hours. It was just unacceptable. I managed to do a better job in less than an hour at the local car wash for $9. Then, we we brought up the fact the ""detailers"" left sand on our leather, new scuffs on the doors, and water spots everywhere, their manager could not even be bothered to come and apologize, and attempt to make things right. I think the final straw though, was trying to take the car in to correct a deficiency in the radio/satellite/bluetooth. Their ""service"" department spent over an hour and a half just looking for an update for the stereo, only to come back and tell us we would have to call the manufacturer, which I mistakenly thought would have been something any half-competant service department would have done. Then, they decided to ""take a look"" at the radio, which they never even bothered to do. We waited an additional hour, and when we told the service desk person we wanted our car back, it was in the exact same parking spot it was in since the last time we talked to them. THEY HAD NOT EVEN BOTHERED TO MAKE AN ATTEMPT. In summary, do yourselves a favor, and take your business elsewhere, this place does not value your time, and just wants to take your money. ",2.4

114,"June 24, 2013","To Whom It May Concern,

I would like to take the opportunity to commend one of your employees. It's been my experience that when an employee goes above and beyond their normal job duties, the employee should be commended. In this day and age, complaints are easily sent with several keyboard strokes and mouse clicks; however, letters of praise are rarely sent to employers. In this instance, I would like to commend Robert Knight. He had explained to me that OEM replacement parts weren't in his department. He did however assist me in purchasing new floor mats and a lip for my 2011 Dodge Charger. He was extremely helpful and courteous in his demeanor and could be considered a pillar of excellence in terms of customer service. As a department manager for a Fortune 500 company, I devote a tremendous amount of financial resources towards customer service and customer appreciation training. Word of mouth advertisement can easily generate or defer at least fifty customers towards or away from a business. In this instance, I will recommend Mack Massey and Robert Knight for all of my professional colleagues. 

There is a training program which all of the employees in my department recently completed, ""Customer Service is Worthless, and Customer Loyalty Is Everything."" Robert exemplifies many of the examples in this training seminar. Thank you for your service Mack Massey!

At first I went in to the dealership looking to trade in my 2010 Jeep Wrangler Sahara for a new one. While I was there I met Bob and he was very focused on customer service. I appreciated the effort he put forth in figuring out what I wanted and initiating the search for my new Sahara. To my surprise, he called me a few days later and was excited about a Moab edition they had received at the dealership. He warned me that it wasn't the color I was looking for, but it was worth my time coming in to see it. Sure enough, I took the time to look at the Moab and even though it was black, I actually started considering the possibility. The more I thought about it, the more the Moab grew on me. Bob did an amazing job of keeping on me about the Moab, but unfortunately I missed out on it by one day. Some other lucky guy had come in a day before me to take the Moab to Oklahoma. Although I was discouraged for not acting sooner, Bob was enthusiastic about finding another for me. Two days later, he did just that. He found a Moab for me in Arizona that was even better than the one I missed out on and followed up to make sure a dealer trade happened in order to get my Moab here. As much as I had told myself that I would never own a black vehicle, I am now the proud and happy owner of a black Moab and it was all thanks to the hard work and dedication by Bob Nicely.

131,"March 17, 2013","I entered the dealership at 9:00 A.M. this morning. I was welcomed by Bill Hawkins and informed Bill I had lunch plans with friends at 12:00 and I intended to make that appointment. Bill asked a series of questions to better understand what I was looking for and to better assist me. Little did I know I just met a new friend. Bill showed me several vehicles with various options until I settled on the Jeep Wrangler I wanted.

Let me say that my three hour visit included Bill and I reminiscing about old times in El Paso, reviewing times past and both our business experiences.Is buying a car supposed to be fun? I guess it can be.

I was then sent to finance and was introduced to Carlos Ramos by Bill. I signed the necessary forms, Carlos gave me an indepth explaination of each form. Oh wait, then Carlos and I talked about my old Jeeps of the past, he then pulled out his phone and showed me pictures of his Jeep. Not sure if you folks understand this but the finance guy made some MOPAR sales. I took mental notes and I'll be visiting that department soon.

Here is the point of this experience, I made two friends, they both formed an intergration of Mack Massey's different departments with value selling beyond my purchase.

As Bill and I wrapped up, he gave me a tour of the service department at which time I found out that he put a rush on my new Jeep's ""make ready"" because he knew I wanted to be out of there by 12:00. 

I will recommend the Mack Massey organization, the teams that built it and the service that supports it to anyone that I come across that is looking for any make of your vehicles or any used vehicle. I think thats a vote for class.

Michael Edmond gave me a full tour of the service and agency area, was wonderful, friendly,supportive and at all times NOOOOT pushy, which is very important to feel comfortable when purchasing a vehicle :-)

Michael continued support after vehicle was purchased, and always friendly and honest!

Carlos Ramos was very helpful in making me understand the financeia aspect of it, and look for the best way to help me with the financing of the vehicle.  Carlos was also very friendly and supportive! :-)

151,"October 30, 2012",I was looking for a 3/4 to 1 ton pickup truck. Not once had I dealt with Mack Massey Dodge before. We went through the dealership and found a couple of diesel pickups that I liked. Unfortunately the monthly payment was higher than what I wanted to spend. I left the dealership that day and later on went to a couple of other dealerships. The only dealership and salesman that came got back with me was Marco at Mack Massey. He actually looked for other vehicles when I was not there. Eventually I found that the deal that he got for me was the best one out of most dealerships in El Paso. Thanks to him I am now enjoying my new used Ford F350. ,5.0
152,"October 18, 2012","My husband and I actually took our Jeep in to get repaired. While waiting for the work order to be processed we decided to walk to lot and look at potential vehicles. While walking we ran into salesman Marco Herrara. We told March we were just looking but if we found anything we wanted to drive we would go ask for him. We ended up finding a Dodge Avenger we liked, found Marco and took the vehicle for a test drive. We fell in love with the vehicle on the test drive. Although we weren't planning on buying a car until after the first of the year we thought we would see what payments would be like. We said we wanted payments at $400 max. Marco went to see what he could do. He came back with payments right under $400 and the dealership would pay off what we owed on our Jeep. We really needed to go home and thing about this. We looked over our finances and decided we would do the buy if Marco could get the payments around $350-$360. I called Marco told him what we wanted and he got it for us! We went back that morning, started the paper work and drove off the lot with our car that afternoon. 

This was the first dealership that we have been to where we were not bombarded by salesmen. The dealership was the cleanest we had ever seen a dealership. We were very impressed with the staff, they were super nice and did everything they could to make sure we got the best deal we could. We without a doubt will recommend future customers to Mack Massey and to Marco. 

Only problems we had was with the detailing of our vehicle, which was part of our contract. My 10 year old brother could have done a better job. Also, my vehicle ended up with a scratch on the mirror. With my vehicle being white you notice anything that wasn't there before. I emailed the sales manager almost 2 weeks ago and still have not heard back. Needless to say I ended up detailing the car myself the next day. ",4.8
153,"October 14, 2012","Having dealt with Dick Poe once before, I was determined not to deal with them again. So, when I decided I wanted my first brand new vehicle, I did a TON of research, and found the best prices at Mack Massey. 
Not only did I have a wonderful experience with the staff of Mack Massey, but the internet sales manager personally showed me all the available vehicles that I had mentioned I was interested in via email, but he also explained the available options as far as discounts and helped me get the best price I could have on my new Jeep.
The point when I decided I would never recommend anyone go elsewhere for a new vehicle was when the internet sales manager asked my permission to run my credit by a couple banks to see if they would give me a better APR than my bank had. He told me that he was positive I could do better given my high credit score- and, had he not suggested this, I would be paying nearly twice as much a month on the same vehicle loan. 
I could not be more impressed with the service, the interactions I had with personnel in passing, and the efforts they went through to ensure I got the best deal possible. I highly recommend Mack Massey and all their staff.",5.0
154,"October 09, 2012","I had just stopped into the dealership to do some pre-purchase browsing. A salesman, Manny Manjarrez came over, introduced himself and walked me around the lot, including the back lot where a considerable number of Jeeps were parked. He was patient and loaded with information about the vehicles. When my eyes locked onto a black Jeep, he got the keys and we took a drive. I did not make my decision right away. I would drop in and take a second, third and even fourth look. Each time Manny would be there, answer my questions and follow the progress of my search. In the end, his efforts drew me to make the purchase. Since then he has maintained regular contacts with me through e-mails, calls and personal visits when I come to the dealership for servicing on my Jeep. He has gone way out of his way to be more than just a salesman. He is enthusiastic about the product, knowledgeable and courteous. Mack Massey has done well having this young man on their team. I would recommend future customers to Mack Massey to look him up when in the market for one of their products, and the dealership has done a fine job of earning my business, respect and appreciation.

155,"September 28, 2012","First of all I will state that my experience with my salesman was great.  He was not pushy and worked very hard to get me into the car I WANTED.  I have been looking for a car for a while and it felt like I was being pushed into something I didn't like.  I loved the internet service.  Louie made it awesome in that he constantly kept me posted from the moment I called to the minute a bank picked up the offer.  He went to the extent of texting me the picture and it meant the world to me.  I love my car sooo  much and its funny but many people tell me that I look so proud of my car.  I AM!!! I have had four different cars in my life and I love this one the best by far...
I thank you once again for the excellent service and I will say your location is very nice!  I will definately spread the word around of your location and if I ever get a car again I will go straight over there.... and I mean it!  Thank you from a very happy customer!  Leticia Sagaribay",4.8
156,"March 13, 2012",Mack Massey has a poorly run Service Department.  I wouldn't trust them with anything more than an oil change.  Maybe their technicians can at least figure out how to do that.,1.5
157,"January 07, 2012","I bought a truck from this dealer a year ago.  The truck I wanted was on the website, but not on the lot.  The sales rep assured me that it was available for purchase as new and wanted to establish a purchase price without showing me the vehicle.  I thought it was odd that I was being asked to put forth a purchase price before I even saw the vehicle, but it was new and surely what could be wrong.  We agreed upon a price and they asked if I wanted to go through with the purchase, and I said I did.  I live 200 miles away and came to town with my family for a couple of days so staying one more day to get the vehicle was no big deal.  The next day they informed me that they could not get the vehicle, because it was at the owners house.  They said we would complete the sale and give me another vehicle to drive home and then exchange the vehicle in a couple of days.  I said this would be o.k.  While filling out the paper work they had the wrong vehicle on the purchase order and refused to provide the lending terms of agreement for an Ally bank loan.  Ally bank was offering an additional $1000 of the purchase price, and I have a bad habit of trading early.  Every thing was finally corrected, but not until after the sales rep of rudely, verbally berated in front of me.  Once all the paper work was done we were given a different vehicle to drive home.  This is when they asked if we would be able to drive the 200 miles back, that is one way, to exchange the vehicles in two days.  I informed them I had to work, and so the asked if my wife with a one year child would do it.  I elected not to take a dump on my family and told them no.  We finally agreed upon a half-way point six days later.  On the way out of town the dealer called us and asked if we could bring the vehicle back.  They said that some one else was buying the vehicle and we were given our old vehicle back.  I spoke with the general manager about the issues, but he did not care.  I got a lot of that's to bad, but we got your money and we're happy responses.  

On a separate occasion the vehicle had to be brought back for warranty work.  This time my wife with the now two children dropped the vehicle off and were given a ride back to the hotel.  After being dropped off they were informed that the dealer would not be able to pick them up.  They needed to find their own way back to the dealer to recover their vehicle with a factory defect.  I managed to find a ride in a town that I do not live in to the dealership.  Once again I spoke to the manager about the poor quality of service and the total lack of concern for my families well being.  The response was that that is how they do business.  

You may be able to haggle your way into a fair deal on a vehicle at this dealer, but watch your back.  They will try to get you.",1.0
