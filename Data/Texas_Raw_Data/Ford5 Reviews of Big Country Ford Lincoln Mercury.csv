0,"July 11, 2018","Despite my multiple tellings of what was happening with my Ford SUV that I wanted resolved.  The intake clerk had no engine knowledge and didn't pass it along to the mechanic.  The mechanic finally stated I needed a new engine because he wasn't sure why I had antifreeze in cylinder #2 and he looked at the odometer and decided I needed a new engine.  When I questioned him he said he wasn't sure if I had a crack or a gasket leak.  I told him there is a big difference between a leaky gasket, or a cracked head and replacing an engine - he told me that he looked at the odometer and with that many miles he   thought I needed a new engine.  I told him that I had told the in-take people multiple times that I had a new engine in the vehicle that only had 60K miles.  The mechanic said ""I thought it looked like it was in good shape""  He based his analysis on the odometer instead of looking intently into the problem.  The clerk didn't seem to think that was a problem because he had zero knowlege of basic engine mechanics - which he admitted to me   Now I have to take my vehicle to a much better mechanic who will repair my SUV based on real issues rather than the mileage on my odometer.",1.0

2,"March 26, 2014","Went to this dealer to test drive a new Fusion Hybrid and get a quote for my 2004 Saleen Mustang.  I dealt with Buddy Reynolds.  He was a very nice man even though he was not competent when it came to the hybrid.  The huge negative with this dealership is the trade in value I got on my Saleen.  

To explain my situation, my Saleen has 21,000 miles on it.  It is in almost perfect condition.  Oh, it is an SC model which means supercharged coupe.  It is also a one owner, adult driven, well maintained, and has brand new nexen tires, and a brand new Optima battery.  High retail value at NADA.com (which I strongly believe it should qualify for) is $33,300 .  Now I understand the dealership has to make money, and I was not expecting a number even close to that.  Without even driving my car I was given an appraisal of $8,000.00.  I literally laughed at the offer.  When I saw the $8,000 number on Buddy's sheet (before he explained everything)  I thought that was going to be the amount I would owe on the hybrid after trading in my car.  Oh no, I would have still owed something like $27,000.00.

I have nothing against Buddy Reynolds at all.  He was a very nice salesman and treated us well. 

In summary though,  If you would like to waste your time in having this dealer give you a completely bogus offer, then pay them a visit.  If, however, you seriously want to trade in your car and be treated fairly, stay as far away from this place as you can.",2.0
3,"July 09, 2013","I contacted this dealership on an advertised Mitsubishi Montero the weekend of June 15, 2013. Sales representative Lloyd called back and emailed me additional pictures. As we were negotiating a purchase price, Lloyd went on vacation and wasn't heard from since. So, I was forwarded to the General Manager, Thomas Skull. I made an offer to Thomas and arranged my pickup information as I was coming in from Minnesota to this Texas dealership and driving back. He agreed, and we moved forward with a credit card deposit to hold the vehicle and agreed that the balance would be paid with cash upon acceptance. 
The next day, I was contacted by sales representative Amanda who informed me that this agreed purchase price was not valid as Lloyd (supposedly on vacation) did not agree to it. Anyhow, with Amanda's accusatory, condescending, ""treat you like a thug"", direction, I agreed to their full advertised price. 
Now, just days prior to my flying down to pick up the vehicle, Amanda texts me information/pictures that the vehicle is inoperable and being brought to a mechanic for diagnosis. The day before flying down, I contacted Thomas who said that the vehicle repairs required exceed the value and that's that. Interestingly, the pictures of the supposed inoperable vehicle showed the instrument panel with the check engine light lit. Evidently to portray a broken vehicle? Problem with this picture? The vehicle wasn't even running! My guess is that they sold the vehicle from under me as CarFax showed ""sold"" 6/26/13. 
So, I'm out $212. for my one-way, non-refundable air ticket to DFW, and the vehicle that we planned on. As expected from Big Country Ford, no customer reconciliation was offered. Another vehicle?
Simply put, I would by all aspects not recommend this dealership to anyone, regardless of what their initial offering is. They renege on their agreement, and ultimately can't offer a product. Lloyd was never heard back from, Thomas Skull didn't have anything right, and Amanda was unknowledgeable and downright rude. Heck, I wasn't a bad customer...I agreed to their full price with cash and to pick up the vehicle at the dealership rather than have them transport to another Texas site as their web site offered. (DFW?)
Sorry guys, too many other Texas competitors that work with integrity and customer service.",1.0
4,"July 31, 2011",i went and test drove 3 used vehicles at Brownwood Ford on July 21 after driving these 3 cars I was interested in one but wasn't sure if I would be able to get the financing needed at the right price for me.  I went inside with them while Joe punched in numbers to see about getting me prequalified for the loan. After a little while he came back to me and said he thought he had one that would be suitable for me. The payments quoated was about 50 dollars more than I originally said but I thought that I could do this but I also wanted to check with my insurance carrier to see what the car would run me on insurance. Joe stated that the loan company needed some information from my mortgage company and that he was also waiting on answer from another lender. It was also time for them to close so after leaving a check for 1500.00 I went home to wait to see if Friday would have answer from other lending service and to call my insurance company.  Monday I called and told him I had found insurance that was good and had talked to mortgage company and they would be faxing required document within 24-48 hours. The rest was just a wait game I thought then on Friday when I called i was told that the lender wouldn't loan that money on that car but would on the other one i drove which although a little disappointed I was ok with it. Joe also stated I needed to have answer if i was going to get that one cause if not that another dealership in the metro-plex wanted car or it was being sent there. The problem started when i got to dealership and made statement to one guy that i sure wished i could see the one i had originally put the 1500.00 towards and was told it was in back so i went inside to sign my papers after this was done as i was standing up getting ready to leave i made the comment to Jodie who was the finance and insurance manager that glad to be in car but still wished could have got the other one (at this time i was still assuming that the car was in back like i was told by) and he(jodie) commented that one sold at the beginning of the week.  I said to him what i was told it was in the back and he then stated he didn't know.  At this time I was really upset and as I was going to my car the original salesman came to give me the keys and to tell me that they owed me a car wash and detail cause those guys had already left for the day. I think he could tell something was wrong so i made the comment to him that i liked this car but was still disappointed cause it wasn't the 1st one i had wanted and that i was upset cause had been told by one person that car was in back and by another that it was sold during this conversation he had made the comment that it had loaned out or something.  Needless to say that was just another lie I felt.  I do still feel i was lied to to get both cars sold because as i was leaving i got on the internet site and behold that car was not even in the inventory anymore.  I feel this was poor business and unprofessional due to the fact that i had gave them a 1500.00 check.,2.8
