I had a leak in the trunk, and they found it , corrected it with pinch welds, painted it and put my Malibu back together, and I couldn't be happier with the price. I worked with Paola Rodriguez and she gets the job done, keeps you informed, has her people take pictures of the damage and then follows up with pictures of the repairs! I'm very happy I chose Classic Chevy of Sugar land.

35,"September 16, 2019","The service department is in serious need of modification. I had an appointment for an oil change and tire rotation on a Saturday at 12:00pm. When I was approached by the ‚ÄúService Advisor‚Äù I was informed that there was a 2 hour and 30 minute turnaround. I told her that I had an appointment, with confirmation I remind you, at 12:00. She replied that there were 30 customers ahead of me and she could get me in at 7:00am Monday morning. I‚Äôm sorry ‚Äúservice advisor‚Äù I have to go to work. That‚Äôs why I made an appointment for this time. I guess my interpretation of the word ‚Äúappointment‚Äù has been wrong for all my life. I‚Äôve tried to contact the service manager several times to inquire about this issue, but he was unavailable and has not returned my call. Thank you Classic Chevrolet Sugar Land Service department for wasting my gas and time. Believe me, I will contact someone in management that WILL make this right.",1.7

37,"September 07, 2019",I took my Corvette there because it said service charging system.  The kept my car for a week and then told me that it was my Starter that causing me problems.  They replaced my Start.  I drove the vehicle for two days and my Check the Charging warning light came on.  I took it to another mechanic shop that was recommended by one of their service Rep.. The mechanic told me that it was my Alternator.  I contacted Classic and they refused to take any action.  Up management stop taking my calls.  I had to contact GMC.  Service is awful.  Beware of then repairing something just to put money in their pockets.,1.0

39,"August 27, 2019","I hate New Car Dealerships.  I've always had terrible experiences with the.  This was no different.  My husband and I were looking for a vehicle because our other vehicle flooded out.  It was paid off with Insurance and GAP Insurance and we had patiently waited through that long process.  We spend our Saturday in the dealership with new salesman Kaylon.  Kaylon seemed nice and helpful.  He was personable and funny.  He gained our trust.  We knew our situation presented a challenge but Kaylon assured us we would be okay.  He mentioned how earlier two customers he had came in to pick up brand new vehicles after having to leave empty handed.  Saturday we left empty handed with the hope that Kaylon would call us Monday with good news.  Time passed Monday, no calls.  Finally my husband calls me with Kaylon on the line telling us come on in, the deal's approved. Here's your down payment request, here's your monthly note.  My  husband and I are ecstatic.  We drive to the dealership thinking we were there to sign papers.  Get there, no Kaylon.  They call him, they message him, no answer.  Finally they tell us he had to leave.  Okay, no problem.  We start to work with a new salesman, thinking, he'll pull our file and we'll sign our paperwork.  New salesman tells us there is no paperwork, there is no approval, there is no deal.  Not sure what Kaylon was talking about.  My husband remained hopeful but I already knew we had been lied to.  3 hours later, a rerun of our credit, two new salesmen, my husband and I leave empty handed again.  I think both of us were trying not to cry in front of the other.  To look strong in spite of the amazing disappointment we'd just experienced.  I would've appreciated it better if he had just said No approval, I'm sorry.  To lie, to have us drive out there and sit for hours.  How is that okay?  I'm trying to find out where I can go to have my voice heard because the incredible waste of time we endured based on some new salesman wanting to look good is more than I ever thought I would have to deal with.  I'd appreciate any advice on how I can make my voice heard.  I know salesman are sneaky, but I didn't think they would just flat out lie and waste people's time....  What did he get out of that?",2.2
40,"August 21, 2019",Bought Chevy Malibu in for repair -never fixed the problem charged me 458. 00 to take off valve cover to diagnose plus parts.  Drove off lot had the same code. And car stalled in 5:00 traffic.  Will never bring a car their for service only interested in selling you new engine or directing you to buy a new car.   Even had general manager or maybe owner  called me insisted he would get my car fixed and get the mechanic and service manger in front of his fave  Never heard a word from him. Sorry xxx service.  I will tell everyone I know not to use them.  Car worse now won‚Äôt stay running in park. Same codes p0016 cam actuators and stabilize track need services.   Tried to tell me first was timing chains then went oil vacuum pump.   ,1.0
41,"August 16, 2019","Their service rep‚Äôs are really good with their customers.  Mr. Sanchez and a second gentleman (did not get his name), really helped me get some issues settled with my truck.  In my opinion they went to bat for me!  Thank you very much gentlemen!",5.0
42,"August 13, 2019",Exceptional staff who delivers on time. I never have an issue when I service my vehicles at Classic. Sanchez  always delivers with a smile  and is great to work with. ,5.0
43,"August 07, 2019","Took my truck in to this dealership for service, and inside personnel were great but mechanics were HORRIBLE ! 
Got my truck back with oil and grease hands all over the hood, fenders, and door handles outside and inside. Steering wheel and arm rest as well. 
Also the locks they used to remove my wheels were just thrown right in the middle Consol. 
They could‚Äôve at least put them back in the glove compartment where they themselves got them to begin with. The only reason I didn‚Äôt go back and complain was because I was already late to a meeting.  
Advice to the next person that goes there for an oil change, check your vehicle before you leave. ",1.4

46,"July 31, 2019",It was an insurance claim that was poorly handled.  Took five weeks to replace an oil Pan.  Sanchez was a nice guy but the overall handling of the matter was not good.  The car was tied up for 5 weeks.  It was partly State Farm and Part Classic Chevy.  My car was just not a priority.  I had to call and follow up 6 times.  Should not have been that way.  When the car was finally ready it was returned to me filthy dirty and smelled like oil on the inside.  A car wash would have been the right thing to do.  ,2.6
47,"July 30, 2019","Scheduled an appointment for regular service of my car.  Service adviser quickly took the car in, and advised me when it would be ready. When I got the car back, I was pleasantly surprised at how inexpensive the service was, and they did an exceptional job on cleaning my car after the service. Although the Dealer was exceptionally busy that day, he job was completed within the time I was advised it would take.",5.0
48,"July 27, 2019",Being able to book appts online and getting quality service is why I come back. Wouldn't you? This is my 2nd vehicle with Classic and the service and quality of staff is one of the main reasons I keep Classic as my dealership.,5.0

56,"July 10, 2019","Acknowledged within 2minutes of driving into the service department. Service advisor came to get information and any concerns regarding my vehicle within 5 minutes. Service advisor, Gilbert before moving to another customer asked if I had any other concerns or questions. Didn‚Äôt feel rushed. Waited for vehicle to be completed for oil change, new air filter, tire rotation and wash for about an hour. Gilbert was at the check out counter with me and went over all service completed on vehicle and kindly asked again if I had any questions. Never felt like a revolving number or cash flow for the dealership. ",4.8

59,"June 26, 2019","When I purchased my car in 2016 with Alexa and finance manager Eric I had a wonderful experience! Fast forward to 2019 it was a HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE and I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND ANYONE TO THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT NOT EVEN MY WORSE ENEMY! When I first went to the service department I had issues with the starting. I suspected it was either the battery or the alternator, and it was diagnosed as the battery and ground cable. The cheapest they could get me out was $625 and of course I declined (single mom; $625 is steep compared to $150 at Walmart, and I have to watch my budget) . I guess they were not happy with the declination  and left my vehicle in worse condition than it was when I dropped it off. When I dropped the vehicle off, the rearview camera, signal lights, horns and lights all worked. When I picked it up, none of these things worked. I was told it was ""electrical issues"" seeing that those issues didn't exist when the car was dropped off. Next, they attempted to clean the corrosion and left the battery and engine parts covered in corrosion and the battery cover was tossed to the side and not snapped back on the battery. I visited a local Walmart and the mechanic was blown away at the condition of the battery under the hood and informed me that the cover was in the incorrect place and could have caused damage seeing that I was driving around without it in the proper place. Since I didn't purchase the battery and labor from the service department they just threw my car together and gave it back to me, they didn't even have the common decency to return it in the condition it was dropped off. This is poor customer service and I will be sure to share this experience with all of my friends and family who shop with classic Chevrolet. I know it's time for a trade in and I will definitely be taking my business to another chevrolet dealer in Houston due to the poor service I received in the service department. ",1.0

61,"June 12, 2019","I've been using Classic Chevrolet service for our Impala and Pontiac GTO for over 5 years.  The service people are friendly and professional.  I try to pick an early appointment time and very often, I am on my way home by 8:30.  The facilities are always clean and inviting.  The service managers are always helpful and keep you informed as work progresses.  Their tire prices were the best the last time I needed replacements.",4.8
62,"June 10, 2019","We walked in and stated that we knew what we wanted, and needed no test drive to sell us on a vehicle.  We wanted to sit down and talk numbers.  The sales manager placed us with a rep and we began the process.  With in ten minutes we had the initial paperwork taken care of.  Although they did not have a vehicle in stock, they found several from other dealerships and began to arrange to bring it in.  We came back four days later (due to our schedule) and we did a walk through of the vehicle and got through finance in about an hour and a half.  We really love the stress free buying environment at Classic Sugarland.  We drive 75 miles to not play the games that other dealers play with new car buyers.",5.0
63,"June 10, 2019",It was really awesome. I went in with an idea of what i wanted. He showed me around the lot pointed out all of my options and it didnt take long at all. Got me in a brand new Silverado. I'm completely satisfied.,5.0

65,"June 10, 2019","Thursday, May 30th, I was making sales calls on the West side of Houston.  I live in San Antonio and recently started to cover the Houston area.  My company vehicle is a 2019 Silverado (6,600 mi).  After leaving a sales call in Strafford, TX., I realized that my truck was not breaking correctly.  Fleet Company, ""Merchants"" advised that the closest Chevy dealership was in Sugar Land which was 12 miles away which I was able to locate after a frightening 45 minutes, white knuckle drive.  As I was waived into the service lane, I had a gut feeling that this was going to be a terrible experience.  I did not have time for this as I wanted to get back home by the next day in my company vehicle and not a rental.  Just waiting for a few minutes, Service Advisor, David Anderson came to my rescue.  After explaining my perdicament, he went to work.  He was able to get the truck and myself checked in.  After getting a rental set up ""at no charge"", David said that he would do his very best in getting my truck ready by the next day and that he would call me.  Leaving in the rental car I was not hopeful, being that the next day was a Friday and the last day of the month, I knew that this was probably not going to happen.  I wanted to get home and to enjoy Saturday with my family before leaving again on Sunday for New Orleans for a week.  I was about 30 minutes away from the dealership, when David called me on the phone to let me know that my truck was fixed!  He had explained to his Service Manager what the deal was and that I was out of town.  They were able to get my truck in that afternoon.  The computer, and brake module was reset.  He said that they closed at 6 pm., and I told him that I would be there.  I had 45 minutes to make it back and I did.!  
David Anderson went above and beyond for me and I really do appreciate it.  He and his team made a difference and my perception of service at a dealership.  Thank you so Much David for your help!
 Classic Chevorlet, Sugar Land, has real life assets that they put in place for Service.  Thank  you!!! Scott E. Kirby

72,"May 12, 2019",Service Dept did not find the problem several different times I brought my car in for service. I went to a private mechanic who identified the issue. I took the car back to the dealership for service and told them what what an outside mechanic found and what he said needed to be done and after keeping the car after 5 days I picked the car up and the noise is still there after several days of keeping the car. They replaced struts that didn‚Äôt need replacing and turned the rotors which also wasn‚Äôt the problem. The car is still in the same position as it went in because the root of the problem isn‚Äôt fixed on the car. Very disappointed in the quality of work from the work shop and service dept. ,2.6

If I could rate a 0 I would, I have been going to classic Chevy for 5 years now. I have bought two cars and was thinking about getting a truck. I will not bring my business here anymore. They do not care about their customers like they use to. I went to service and was not even greeted. They advertise they are open til 6:30 and when I stopped by I had to get out and walk in to ask for help. They guy looked at me crazy when I asked for help, then stated we do not do oil changes anymore. So I‚Äôm thinking what dealership does not do oil changes. So I asked what did he mean they don‚Äôt do oil changes anymore. He stated it‚Äôs after 5:30, I said then why are you all open til 6:30 if you stop at 5:30. That doesnt make sense. He said for pick ups only. Again why are they open if u can‚Äôt aervixe anyone. It would be like me having a business and opening the doors and say to my customers oh u can‚Äôt ahop here until a certain time. Every time I have visited this location for the past few oil changes have been a huge disappointment. These people are ridiculous and only care about taking your money. I don‚Äôt even know why they have 4.5 stars, they must be asking their customers to score them high. This is a horrible place and I will not be coming back.",1.0

100,"October 26, 2018","Be careful when dealing with this dealership. It is under new ownership and they are pretty slick. While on their website I used their valuation tool to value my vehicle, which said it was worth between $11k-$13k and a final number would be offered upon inspection. Within minutes of completing the valuation I was called by 5 (yes 5) different people telling me they saw my information and wanted to buy my vehicle badly for their inventory. None of the callers had a clue that I was being called by one of their fellow salesmen. Although annoying I figured they needed the inventory and they already offered me (via the web) a good range for my vehicle. I agreed to bring the vehicle into the dealership and told the salesperson exactly what I was looking to purchase, if I was to make a purchase and asked him to have options available to view upon arrival of my scheduled appointment. When I showed up at the dealership an hour later they were not prepared for my appointment. I was given excuses about how many vehicles they were selling and they were busy busy busy selling. While my vehicle was being valued the sales person wanted to drive me around the lot and pick out a vehicle that I liked. I explained that this is a waste of time since I was looking for something specific. Finally after 20 minutes driving around in his golf cart listening to the salesperson go on about how great sales were he finally agreed that it would be better to go to the dealership's public website to search for a vehicle to show me, something I could have done at home. If they hadn't offered me such a HIGH trade-in I would have walked out but I was kind and stuck around waiting for the final valuation. Long story short (too late) the valuation finally came in and they only wanted to offer me $9k!!! TOTAL BATE AND SWITCH. Get you in the door with a promise of a high trade in value and try to sell you something you don't want. I purchased my vehicle current vehicle from this dealership 8 years ago and their motto was ""Relax and Enjoy the Difference"". Well those days are gone. BUYER BEWARE.",2.8

However there are some things I didn‚Äôt care for . The car ended up going in my dads name . The financing process was very unorganized. My dad has an account with on of their financing company he was asking questions in regards to the company and the financing manage I. My option was very rude and his tone came off irritated when my dad was asking questions. My dad is also in his 70s so you would have though a little more compassion would be present . 
Also when I test drove the car all the pieces were in the car . However after purchasing one of the main key features that was shown to me ( a mirror console cover) was missing . I immediately reached out and the sell instantly claims he doesn‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about even though he used to work for the same dealer and make of my car. It has been almost 3 months and it still has not been replaced . It may sound small but if I sign for a 35,000 plus vehicle I want everything that was shown to me during the text drive . 
Not to mention after driving off the lot my brakes are bad and the ac all of sudden stopped blowing hot

My truck has an 8K+ custom paint job that was less than 2 months old on it so when it arrived at dealership several individuals came outside to look at it, including a service tech. I told him what the issue was  and also told him there was not a single blemish on the paint job on my truck and I expected it to be that way when I picked it up.  One week after it was dropped off I was contacted and told that they couldn‚Äôt determine what the issue was and that it ‚Äúprobably was something to do with the after market police radios I have in the truck‚Äù. Well that‚Äôs another story in itself (about how they fixed the mechanical issue with the truck and didn't even realize it) but the real issue is that when I came to pickup my truck and was doing a walk around inspection with the service tech we discovered 3 major scratches on the hood, scratches that were all the way through the clear coat and the paint.  The tech agreed that the scratches were not there a couple days ago but told me in no uncertain terms that the dealership ""would take care of everything""!  I then called my salesman who also confirmed that the scratches were NOT there when he came and looked at the truck a couple days prior to that day, and he told me not to worry and the ‚Äúthe dealership would take care of the damage and they would review their camera footage to determine who exactly caused the damage‚Äù.
Well, I then called my boss Adam immediately after that conversation and told him about what happened. Adam said he would pickup the loaner truck that I had to leave overnight at the dealership in the morning and I suggested that he speak with the Service Manager- Ronny Blakeway- and verify how the ‚Äúpaint repair‚Äù would be handled.  The next morning my boss met with Me. Blakeway who proceeded to ask Adam ‚Äúwell how do we know that the damage didn‚Äôt occur at your shop and your just trying to get us to be responsible for it‚Äù or something to that affect.

117,"June 16, 2018","Classic Chevrolet in Sugarland advertised a very good price on a vehicle I have been looking at for awhile. I filled out their form online to make sure they had it. They responded in writing, yes they had the vehicle at the price advertised. 
The next day before I went down to talk to them about it, I notice that the price went up by several thousand dollars. I called and talked to them about it and was bounced around to several Salesman and it took a couple a days for them to figure out it was a mistake or least that's what they told me. I even sent them the confirmation email that I received showing the vehicle and the price.... still no good. Also, the truck conveniently was sold during the 2 days that we were calling back and forth about it.
A manager called me and apologized and said he wanted to make it right by making me a good deal on a different vehicle. We found one and I went and test drove it, but the salesman that was helping me gave me a different price... higher of course... than what the manager told me it was going to be.

158,"October 09, 2017","This is a review for the Pre Owned department only.  I have no experience with new car sales and the experience for that department could differ.

Beware of the trade in numbers acquired from the Classic Chevy Sugar Land site by using the Trade in Valet or the Create your Deal links.  These two links use the latest Nada guides to determine trade in value. Granted the numbers given are for sight unseen and even give a disclaimer that the value could be different than what the dealer would offer.  But the links do take true mileage as a basis.  In theory this information should give a decent ballpark figure to work with, a relative starting point.  But the trade in value didn't come close to even the lowest of numbers given by the Nada guides.

Also beware of your payoff.  I called the finance company before I headed to the dealer to receive an accurate pay off amount on my current vehicle.  But for some reason the dealer quoted a higher payoff amount. Over $1000 difference. Interesting.  How is that even possible?  This created even more separation on their trade in value and payoff.  Not to mention the numbers presented online were about $5500 off.

I was not comfortable with the final deal as presented by the dealer.  Especially after they said they would require a substantial down payment to help offset the difference.  Of course this ""difference"" was almost spot on to the online numbers and the dealer numbers.  Again, interesting.  Seeing what I was dealing with I thanked the salesman and proceeded to get my keys (that they took to evaluate my car) and leave.  The salesman asked me to wait while the manager pulled a printout off a printer.

I suspected the print out would be quick number adjustments geared to the customer who is on their way out the door.  A very common dealer tool to get a sale. (I digress to the point if they could come up with a better deal after the first one was rejected then why not give that deal in the first place?).  I was wrong in my assumption.  It was numbers on my trade in that justified his given trade in value.  These numbers were 4000-5000 off than the numbers given online.  I would agree with some discrepancy but the number he showed was way below the worst case scenario.  Something was passing my sniff test.

I told him that the numbers he showed were not the ones given online.  At this point he stated that the value given online was for a ""garage kept classic"" and the number he was offering would allow for decent retail sale value.  I got the impression he was trying to tell me I didn't know what I was talking about.

Later I researched retail prices of vehicles that matched condition and mileage of mine.  The numbers were much higher than what the sales manager was quoting.

It seemed that doing homework beforehand created a negative experience with sales managers who were unwilling to work with the knowledge that is easily obtained, even from their own website.

Proceed with caution.

234,"December 02, 2014","I had my Chevy towed to Classic as it broke down on my way home from Austin.  I believed it was the CV joint, a covered part under the powertrain warranty.  My car has less than 50k miles.  I was contacted by the service team a short time after it arrived and was told that they too believed the CV joint was bad and would replace it under the warranty.  After the CV joint was replaced the transmission was not performing as expected, it shifted really hard.  The service department called me and said it would be $3600 to fix the transmission.  I told them that it should be covered under the powertrain warranty and they said it wouldn't be and to call my insurance to see if they could cover it!  I was very angry and after I calmed down I phoned the Chevy customer service line and opened a case with them.  They assured me that my transmission was covered under the warranty and that they would contact the dealership to let them know.  I received a call from a manager at the dealership indicating that he was looking into my issue and would call me back when he had more info.  Someone from the service dept called me and said that the transmission would be covered, but I had frame damage that prevented them from fixing the transmission so they were sending the car to the body shop to get an estimate of what it would cost to fix it.  Ironically, the body shop called and said it would be $3600 to fix the frame.  I advised that I did not have that kind of money and really needed my car fixed.  As of today my car is still somewhere at Classic- either the body shop or the service area.  It has been a month and a half that I have been without a vehicle and I am very close to losing my job over my lack of transportation.  I tried to have Chevy tow it to another Chevy location for so that I could get a second opinion and was told it would cost $80 to do so, which I do not have.   It is very frustrating that you buy a car thinking you will have peace of mind with the warranties that come standard with the car, and then when you have to actually use the warranty you get the run around and end up being without a car for over a month.  I would have never thought that taking my car in for warranty work would so profoundly impact my life- relationships, job, and self worth. ",1.0

I asked him how do they know I need all this changed did the mechanic take my car apart and verify all this needed to be changed.  He said yes the mechanic flush your system but recommends that you change the entire system. That afternoon I went to pick up my car only to find that my car had not ever been touched, the system had not been flushed and my battery was dead.  The next day I called the service manager and told him I don‚Äôt appreciate being lied to and having to make arrangements to pick up my car and no worked had been done on it and my battery was dead.

249,"June 22, 2013",I purchased my Camaro from here after going to three other chevorlet dealerships. I live about 5 mins away from Davis chevorlet dealership that sucked. I chose classic which is about an hour away because their sales team were awesome.They didn't judge me nor treat me different when I walked in like the other dealerships. I have unlimited tire service went to davis chevorlet to get my tires and had the worst experience. Recently I needed a/c service and went to classic and they did such a great job. They provided me with a loaner car and since the drive was so far even put gas in my car while they serviced my car. I love this place and wouldn't go anywhere else! ,5.0

252,"April 20, 2012","f you are looking for a truck or a car you have to go to Classic Chevy in Sugar Land.  Don Kerstetter and his people are the BEST!!!  This was the best car buying experience I have had in my life!  Bob Reed, Carlos Salazar were a pleasure to deal with.  Bob took a great amount of time going over the car I purchased and the features...did a GREAT job.  They treat you like you are a part of a family.  If/when I buy another vehicle, I will go back to Classic Chevy no doubt!

253,"February 25, 2012","I was looking for a dealership with integrity and I found that at Classic Chevrolet. My salesman (Bernard) was an absolute pleasure to work with. Bernard took the time to listen to what I expected during the buying process and he delivered on those expectations flawlessly, making this the absolute best experience I have ever had with a dealership. It is refreshing to find an organization centered on strong morals and focused on partnering with customers to ensure the highest level of value is delivered.",5.0
254,"August 28, 2011",It's our two year anniversary since purchasing our 2009 Chevy Traverse.  We shopped all around town but at Classic we felt comfortable with our salesman's ethics and got a great deal.  Since that time we have used Classic for all servicing of the vehicle and have been more than satisfied.  I love Classic and my Traverse!,5.0
255,"May 31, 2011","Excellent customer service attitude from the moment I stepped on the lot.  Absolutely, no pressure sales approach.  When I gave them my parameters of vehicle needs/type and what my budget could afford they strived and suceeded in meeting those needs.  Felt respected as a customer.",5.0
256,"April 27, 2011","Classic Chevrolet is hands down the best dealership and I highly recommend you purchase your next vehicle from them. I purchased a new 2011 Silverado from them last month and received excellent customer service from start to finish. Before I left that day Mark Kolon (General Sales Manager) and Don Kerstetter (Owner) introduced themselves to me and gave me their business card.  They both thanked me for my business and told me their cell phone number was on their card if I had any questions or concerns.  The following Sunday I had an issue with the vehicle so I called Mark on his cell phone and he told me to bring it in Monday and they would look at it. He assured me that they would take care of it and that is exactly what they did. I am positive that there is not another dealership that would have responded, reacted and resolved the issue in the manner Classic Chevrolet did.  They truly offer a different level of customer service and that is what separates them from other dealerships.  Their customer service comes from the top and does not end when you drive off the lot. 

Thank you again Classic Chevrolet, I will be back when I am ready for a new vehicle.

257,"December 11, 2010","Here it is - my exact letter to the owner. I also sent this to better business bureau and to all my friends, families, people I work with...

Mr. Kerstetter,
 
I bought a Chevy work truck last July, and the sales man Bruce Albright mentioned something about getting a free key replacement if I lose my truck key. He kept on repeating that his wife got 2 or 3 free keys just by calling. That actually happened  to me last month and the ""free""key was non-existent. I tried calling the road assist and they were telling me that the key is free, but the delivery charge is $175.00! How is that free??? I have to bite the bullet because I needed the key but I felt really bad, not so much with the money part because I can always earn the money back, but it is the lie and deceit that really bothered me.

My boyfriend tried calling you, and somebody called back, promising that he will address the problem. That was a month ago. Your service suck, and  your  salesman is a liar. I tried calling you again today, and the woman on the phone said that she is not sure how to contact you, that the best person to talk to is a certain David Alexander. I waited for more than 10 mins on the phone but no Mr. Alexander picked up. That's fine Mr. Kerstetter. I will make sure that not a single penny from me and my family and friends go to any of your dealership  ever again.
