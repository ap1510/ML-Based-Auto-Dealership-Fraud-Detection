0,"June 23, 2020","WARNING:  YOU CAN'T BE FORCED INTO PAYING FOR THE ""WARRANTY"" THEY SELL FOR $2000+ THEY SAY YOU MUST BUY!!!

James told me I was getting a warranty that covered the paint, windows, and so on...even service and that I could use it at any Hyundai.  James said we could not remove the option and they include it with every vehicle that leaves the lot.  He explained what a great value it was and that was the line item on the ""paper"" we signed when we asked.  They are now saying that I agreed to pay OVER INVOICE?!!!  THEY LIE, CHEAT AND STEAL!!!  Please go somewhere else.  I can't get a callback and it has been 10 months.  Tell them you will not pay for the $2991 ""warranty""!  If they won't sell you the car then run and buy it somewhere else.  We bought a Palisade and even though they were in demand they did have them if we had waited another week.  James told us we were getting all of that and more than the $1998 Hyundai offering.  USAA sent us there through the buying service and would not let us pay ""over invoice"".  The $2991 is listed as ""accessories"" on the white paper you initial with them that all car dealers act as if it is some sort of binding document.  PLEASE LEARN FROM US AND RUN!!!!!  GO ANYWHERE ELSE!!!  Frank, we will not return a call...nobody will and they promise they will ""get right back to you"".  We have tried for 10 months in total.  3 months ago we were told, by Hyundai, to contact the General Manager.  We have, we spoke, they promised to call back...they don't.  Again we call, we speak, they say they are still researching and will call back...guess what...they don't.  Again....so...the insanity continues.  I waited a long time before posting something publically, but I can't allow someone else to be placed in this position, especially when time and money means so much during the pandemic.",1.0
1,"December 22, 2019"," Veronica, was efficient & I got exactly the price I wanted..no back & forth. Alvaro was terrific even after sale answering all my questions. Went to another dealer first who kept pressuring to sell me a car I did not want.  Great customer service and really listen to you.  Big difference at Texan!  ",5.0
2,"August 27, 2019","I bought recently a used car from this dealership because of their attractive rates. However, I had bad experience in terms of how the overall my purchase experience went. 

I’m felt misguided and deceived after the purchase. First of all, I was told by the sales agent that this particular car was Certified however, while signing the documents the Finance manager revealed that its just certification “ready” and I’ll have to pay extra if I need certificate in hand. I wonder why the website as well as sales agent mentioned it being a Certified car! BS#*#*}*}*

By the time we were started viewing this car, it was dark and neither sales agent nor I could find a glass chip on the car’s windshield. I found it the very next day. I usually don’t worry about such chips but this particular one was right in front of driver’s seat. This is a purely safety-hazard as it creates split-view whenever there is a car right in front of you. I would have expected any used car to reveal this kind of information upfront - which was missing in this case. This is another instance of mis guidance. Problem is, even after visiting your dealership (hoping they will take care of this and fix it by replacing the windshield)- this dealership showed very absurd response to a recent buyer - folks were laughing with the problem that I reported; their managers were like “sorry boss,now its your car, we cannot do anything now”! I felt so miserable thinking how these same guys were lurking behind me before selling the car and after then after the purchase totally new side of this dealership.

Another concern I had - this particular vehicle was so dirty but I was told the appropriate detail will be done at later point. However, later I was told that only wash will be done and even they cannot honor what they said. I don’t understand how a dealership can back-out for these quality measures - especially first time buyer!

While I was dealership with these problems - I was annoyed particularly with how rude a dealership’s team can become after selling a car 2 days ago! 

I hope after reading this you will take pre cautionary measures by staying away from them.",1.4
3,"July 26, 2019","I bought a 2020 Palisade today and actually enjoyed it! CRAZY, right?! After having a horrible experience with another purchase at another dealer in town, I was gearing up for what I thought would be a long day.  James Teng was super helpful in responding to my email inquiries and couldn't have been more accommodating when I arrived for my test drive. Alvaro in finance was amazing! Showed me all my options, super low pressure and just delightful.  No joke I was in and out in 2 hours.  Highly recommend this dealership. Great service, no games and they are looking out for their customers.",5.0
4,"June 18, 2019","I bought a new Sonata SEL today at Texan. Julio helped me with the sale. Absolutely ZERO pressure of any sort. Julio knows the cars and can answer whatever questions one has. Chazz helped me set up the tech, getting all the Blue Link and Car Play and everything else set up. Phil is the manager and helped tweak the numbers so they came out where I wanted them to. And Alvaro made the finance and paperwork part of the deal painless. Probably the best car buying experience of the couple of dozen times I've bought a car. Highly recommended.",5.0
5,"June 04, 2019","After an incredibly stressful 24 hours, walking in to this Hyundai to work with Johan Cervantes and Alvaro Ojeda was a refreshingly encouraging experience.  
Johan did everything he could to ensure that I found THE car for me - not just a car that would work for me.  Even though I showed up later in the afternoon without an appointment. Johan was able to coordinate with his team to ensure that I had my car delivered ASAP the next day.  In the interim, he even ensured that I would have something to drive and provided a loaner until my new car arrived the next day.  Not only did he find a car that matched every single preference I had - he did so in a way to ensure that I also stayed within my budget! 
When I met with Alvaro to finalize my paperwork, I was more than appreciative that he spoke candidly with me.  I did not feel like I was being sold to and was thankful as is to have been approved to get a fantastic loan for 0% interest.  
Even though I was certainly not in a fabulous mood when I walked in and during all the paperwork, Johan and Alvaro never allowed my bad attitude to get in the way of their admirably empathetic customer service skills and overall superior service delivery. For that fact alone, I cannot thank them both enough or say enough great things about them.  I will absolutely, without a doubt, refer anyone I possibly can to work with them to purchase a car!",5.0
6,"March 30, 2019","BEST experience in town!  These guys are dressed casual & make customers feel comfortable, not pressured!  Bought a new car & traded-in my old one - Frank made the trade work, even though he had to wiggle on the $$ valuation.  Jonathan made sure that I got the SUV that best suited my needs, even though I thought I wanted a sports car.  Alvaro was AMAZING and should be the new standard for ""the Car Finance Guy"" - not the suited, slick & slimy money guy - he worked all the numbers, made sure I was happy & got the best deal, we even talked family & kids!  I won't forget how awesome these guys made the whole experience.  I WILL BE BACK!",5.0

21,"March 20, 2018","My experience with James began when I scheduled to test drive an Elantra through Texan Hyundai's website late on a Friday night. I figured the request went into some automated service that would get back to me in the morning. No, actually, to my surprise James emailed me within 20 minutes asking when I wanted to swing by to drive the vehicle. I was impressed, and as I was replying to his email he sent me a text message to reach out to me. It was almost absurdly easy to set up the test drive, and James' responsiveness made that possible.

My wife and I arrived at the dealership and met James with the first time. He brought the car around quickly for the test drive. When we returned to the office, James answered all the questions I had about the car, and offered some insights that I hadn't thought to ask about. When we got down to talking about price, he was transparent and fair. At no point did I feel I was being ""taken for a ride,"" as is so common with other salesmen. For example, James and I had a good discussion about why one of their competitors was offering a similar model and trim for about $500 less. He suspected, and I quickly confirmed, that they were bundling various situational discounts to lower the price and get you in the door, only to find the price inflate by $1,000 because you aren't an Uber driver, or a military veteran, or a student. I hate those kinds of games. It was that moment that I knew I had made the right choice in dealership, and James was the right guy to sell me this car.

With the details ironed out, James passed me off to Mike to go over the paperwork and the fine print. There was very little, and what there was Mike did a great job explaining in plain English. Again, there was no pressure, no push. Everything was very smooth and I couldn't be happier with how Mike handled the purchase part of the process.

I drove that car off the lot that day, happy with the purchase. Two weeks since, I'm amazed by what this car can do. The Elantra is a great car, offering solid value in an affordable package. It's an easy sell, but James made it fun. It was clear he thought the car and I were a good match, and I feel the end result was fair for all of us.",5.0
22,"March 16, 2018",It was a crazy time In my life and I needed a car really bad . But super Julio made me feel relax and not pressured! And assured that I will get the best deal . And that’s exactly what they did . I drove off with a brand new car for a very good deal ,5.0
23,"March 14, 2018",Had a great experience buying this car.  David was completely professional and helped me to make a good buying decision.  The package I decided on is an upgrade to what I was looking for and I am glad David introduced it to me.,5.0
24,"March 11, 2018",I  came in to have my rear shocks changed out on my 2012  Hyundai and a radiator flush for new antifreeze to be put in. Was in and out in just 1hr. and 15 minutes.Every body there was friendly and answered all my questions nicely. ,5.0

26,"March 07, 2018","My wife and I walked into Texan Hyundai on Saturday evening, about fifteen minutes to closing. We just wanted to take a quick run through and look at what was on the lot. We were greeted by Simon who was friendly and helpful. As we looked Simon went and got Chazz Watts to assist. Long story short, we drove out with the Veloster Turbo on the showroom floor. The whole process from ""we're just looking"" to driving away took less than two hours. On a Saturday night that is more than impressive. Alvaro Ojeda stuck around late to make sure our financing was in order, and did a great job taking care of us. 

My thanks to all involved in making this a painless experience. I am normally not relaxed when I buy a new car, but Chazz and Simon took fantastic care of us, had a few laughs, and made a sale. I truly appreciate that there was no pressure to ""close a deal"" even though we kept everyone there late on a Saturday night (sorry guys...). 

I would most definitely recommend this dealership to any and all.",5.0

34,"February 05, 2018","Well the thing you would hate most is noise in the rear end, but it happens. I had to take my Santa Fe in to have the thumping noise in the rear end checked and talked to Don when I came in and told him what I was hearing and how hard it was to get it to make the noise for someone who was not the regular driver to hear. He told me that if I didn't mind he would take it to lunch and drive over to the place it was easiest to hear [new smooth asphalt on Ave H ] and see what I was talking about so he and Steve went out and drove it and sure enough they heard what I was talking about.  Come to find out the rear end was out of alignment and had cupped the tires a little, so after an alignment i'm back on the road and noise is gone except a small amount that is caused by the cupping but getting better and is a whole lot better than before.

Texan Hyundai had me in a brand new 2018 Hyundai Elantra and back on the road in less time than my insurance company was going to take on the tow.

I am truly grateful to Julio Merino, and all the other staff at Texan Hyundai for all their help.

46,"December 30, 2017","I have always had a negative experience buying cars in the past, dealership sales people tend to be overly aggressive and just want to get you out of the door in whatever car. My experience at Texan Hyundai was different, from the very first phone call I made Chazz ensured i was taken care of, he ensured that the price and car I was inquiring about were just what I was looking for. Chazz even came by to pick me up to take me to the dealership since I didn’t have a way to get there. If it wasn’t for his honest dedication I would have probably bought the car somewhere else.

51,"December 19, 2017","Thanks to a friend  who recently purchased a vehicle,  I came across with Texan Hyundai in Rosenberg, TX.  Even better, I met Erdwin Dominguez (an experienced salesman)  over the phone when I called to discuss what I was looking for in terms of finding a  suitable vehicle for my 16 yrs daughter.  Erdwin responded  to all my questions nicely and  very professionally. He approached every situation with a positive attitude and proactive behavior. Erdwin really understand customer’s needs, has excellent communicational skills and will work hard to meet your expectations (in my case they were not only met but also exceeded) and to provide superior customer service. Recently, I had several terrible and very frustrating experiences dealing with other dealers in town.  Erdwin’s support was instrumental in a) putting my previous frustration aside and b) making our  final decision to buy the vehicle and  buying it from Texan Hyundai. I can tell with confidence that they really “earned my business”
The leadership and finance team are also very approachable and more important they are “transparent” and “Honest” (they do not play disgusting games like others do).  In short, I am very satisfied with my overall experience at Texan Hyundai. Also, I highly recommend Erdwin’s Dominguez (sales). You will not be disappointed!

227,"June 06, 2017","This was my first new car, ever. After deciding the Hyundai Tucson was likely the best fit for me, I took the recommendation of a neighbor and contacted Texan Hyundai in Rosenburg. I spoke with James Teng via email several times before visiting the dealer. During that time he answered the questions that I had in regards to getting the trim and package that I wanted, along with information about financing and down payment. My experience at the dealership was very pleasant, James was easy to work with and did a excellent job of explanning both the options of the vehicle, as well as the terms of the purchase. Alvaro, the finance manager, also gave a thorough explanation of some of the protection options that are available that add to an already oustanding warranty plan. All in all, for my first time buying a new car, I was pleasantly surprised with the process. I believe a majority of that is due to the professionalism shown by the staff of Texan Hyundai. The only bad part was waiting for my vehicle to arrive, but they set me up in a loaner vehicle very similar to the one I had purchased. That slowed me to get used to it before taking delivery of my vehicle. This was greatly appreciated. Thank you James and the rest of the staff at Texan Hyundai.",5.0

245,"May 17, 2017","I would give them no stars if allowed. I went there yesterday to check out a used car that they had on the website. I can't remember the name of the guy who had helped me but he flat out lied to my face. First he told me that fees and licensing would cost around $1000 even though its usually around $500. Then he told me the car I drove 45 mins to check out was sold already. Then he tried to sell me another car that was at a higher price, and during negotiations he kept wasting time and saying give me 5 mins to talk to the manager then come back 20 mins later.

Today I decided something was not right about yesterdays visit so I called the dealership and checked on the car I originally wanted and guess what? It was available and I even scheduled a test drive for tomorrow. I really don't mind if service was bad or slow but lying to your customer just to make more money is unforgivable.",1.0

However the sales person I was initially talking to had quit to pursue different opportunity and new salesman he referred to initially refused to honor the initially agreed upon price. So I left and they called me back since they found out there was a ""computer error"" and the manager looked up the price of the wrong vehicle.  At the end I did get the vehicle at the price I initially agreed on, but I did not like this attempt to manipulate me into paying more, not did I like the experience of being pressured to leave a 5 rating (both times I purchased a vehicle from this place) in return of ""special services"" (which both times turned out to be standard offerings to all new car customers )...

377,"November 10, 2016","My husband and I are die-hard Hyundia fans.  I was first introduced to Hyundia while working in Taegu Korea 16 years ago.  The car we had could not be shipped back to the U.S. because it didn't meet the required U.S. specifications.  However after returning home, we needed an extra car and surprisingly we located and bought a previously own 2001 Hyundia Elantra.  Kept it for 10 years (NO problems during the ownership) and traded it in for a new 2012 Hyndia Accent (my husband's car).  I had purchased a new 2010 Tucson.  Received great service on any recall.
We were very happy with our purchases until we saw the 2017s, with all the upgrades..........Needlessly to say ""I"" traded my beloved Tucson for a 2017 Sante Fe Sports with all the upgrades!!!  Wil Logan, Phil and Alvaro made the purchase seamless.  No pressure what-so-ever. I had planned to upgrade in 2017 but with all the discounts, benefits and car selections made it easy for me to make the purchase now.  I have to say the stress I put on myself was deciding which Sante Fe to buy.  Wil and my husband watched silently as I ran from one Sante Fe to another.  
Wil and the Texan group were excellent in providing information about my car and the services I will receive.  Something not provided to me by my hometown dealership.  When my husband is ready to trade-in his Accent, we will definitely return to Texan Hyundia.  Mary RB",5.0

382,"November 02, 2016","I am very upset and disappointed with Texan Hyundai. I have had all my services done with my car at this dealership since I bought the car in Oct. 2013 from them. At 97K miles my car started having electrical issues. I took the car in for repair under my purchased Extended Warranty. 
1. the first time, it took 2 weeks for them to get approval from the warranty company to do the repairs. once done, it was done wrong. 
the knob went out on my drivers side incline/recline control. they said they fixed it, but when I reclined the seat after it was ""repaired"" it wouldn't go back up! so I had to take it back, the service tech stated the repairman ""accidently"" only replaced the plastic button, and not the whole switch. 
We were having issues with the back driver side tail light... the turn signal, brake light, etc keep going out. 
We have taken the car back 4 (almost 5 since it is going back tomorrow) because of the same issue. 
1st they said it was fixed, but then light went out again. Turns out, the service repair man replaced the Right side, instead of the Left Side. 
then, when it happened again, they said it was because they had used a factory light bulb in the harness. 
Despite the numerous phone calls telling them over and over again that it sounds like an electrical issue that is out side of the Light Harness.....
now, when I have waited a week and a half for a loaner car to take it in, and the Service Manager is trying to tell me I will have to pay for the diagnosis and the repair if I bring it back in again...
REALLY? 
I told them that the problem was never repaired correctly. They keep patching the problems.. they are telling me that the work is not under their warranty, even if they misdiagnosed it the other 4 times I have brought it in. 
The extended warranty company says that they are not liable since the car is over 100K miles now.
not sure what I am going to do, but I know it will involve a local News Channel, and a lawyer. 
I know there is a bigger issue, and the dealership is trying to get out of making the repairs since they screwed it up the first time, and everytime since.
They gave me a card worth 4 oil changes... that is not going to fix me getting tickets for brake lights out!!!

398,"October 20, 2016","I purchased a Hyundai Elantra, and at first I was happy. The dealership told me to do a survey and they would tint my windows. I followed up with the sales-man twice and didn't hear anything. No-one there alerted me that my license plates were in, and they were there almost a month! I had to go visit the dealership myself. A third time, I inquired about my windows being tinted and never heard again. So I gave up. Now I check my credit report and see that there were plenty of hard inquires from trying to finance this little car! Also, with the finance part, they wouldn't allow me a co-signer. Never again will I purchase a car at this place, and now I'm unhappy with this car that I purchased. I'll be getting another Dodge come 2017.",1.6

645,"July 06, 2015","I clicked on a web site that I was interested in some info on the Hyundai Santa Fe Sport. In a very short time, I received an email from Erdwin Dominguez and he asked me to contact him in regards to my interest. I called him and we spoke for a few minutes about what I was looking for in a vehicle. He asked me if I was talking to any other dealers, and I said yes. I told him that since Texan Hyundai was (10) minutes from my house, I would prefer to buy it there. I went to see Erdwin later on that day, and when we met, he introduced me to Aaron Rincon, and told me that Aaron would show me around and answer any questions that I might have. Aaron was very knowledgeable about the vehicles, and I drove (2)  vehicles with Aaron accompanying me. I asked a lot of questions and he had the answers. I left and came back several hours later with my wife-her new car-and we were immediately greeted by Aaron. He showed her several vehicles and answered some questions that she had. Her and I drove a vehicle and she decided that she loved the car, if we could find the color that she liked. That was accomplished so I sat down with Erdwin and we worked out the deal. I was then introduced to Alvaro Ojeda in finance. He was very thorough with going over the numbers and making sure all info was correct. He did a fantastic job of explaining the extended warranty and the high points of the coverage. We finished that part up, and I reconnected with Erdwin. It was well past closing at that time, but I never felt any rush by any of the guys to wrap up and get out. Erdwin gave some additional info on Blue Link and registered me that night. Erdwin told me to let them know if we had any issues or questions with the car. We came back the next day and Aaron spent some time showing my wife all of the features on the car. That was very helpful for her getting to know the car and what it could do. In conclusion, Erdwin, Aaron, and Alvaro were extremely cordial, professional, and knowledgeable about all aspects during the process. It was one of the best car buying experiences that I have ever had as I have bought many cars in my life. They are an asset to the dealership, and I certainly am recommending them to anyone that I know is in the market for a new car. Continued success to the entire Texan Hyundai group. God Bless.

He then cold called me at just the right time as i was looking to trade in.  He found me the perfect car in my 2016 Elantra.  The only issue I had was when it came time to do the finance part. I explained to Erdwin who explained to the finance guy, Alvaro, what i was looking for in regards to payments. When I sat down with him he rattled off a bunch of stuff, then quickly told me my payments would be almost $100 than I was looking for. He then added a rather presumptuous comment of ""Christmas has come early"".  Which bothered me cause I don't consider paying $100 more as early Christmas, more like possible repossession.  He came of as rather ""old-school"" in his approach.  Thankfully Erdwin was more understanding and helped get my payment lower than that and in an area i could comfortably afford.",4.6

He made sure I felt comfortable asking questions and he gave me honest answers. I know they were honest answers because any answers he wasn’t sure of- he didn’t fumble his way through them, he stood up, told me that he would find out and be right back. Odarius also spoke with my friends who had joined me. He showed them around the showroom while I was finishing paperwork. He made them feel at ease while answering their many questions on the new vehicles that had just come in. Odarius allowed us to take our time on the lot and during the paperwork. I never felt rushed or unimportant. While meeting the rest of the staff everyone was very friendly, happy to see me and made me feel right home.

752,"October 13, 2013","My wife and I bought two cars in the span of 6 days. It was kind of a crazy week. During that time, I really appreciated the people at Texan Hyundai. I initially wanted to make an upgrade deal for one of our cars and Rod worked hard to meet a number I had in mind but was very honest in telling me it couldn't be done. I appreciated the honesty as my dream deal was a little bit out of reality. lol  We eventually settled on another deal which as quite satisfactory. Never did we feel pressured during this whole experience and there was  a unique element of friendship that was added to the mix. This factor kind of motivated us to try another deal six days later and again everyone at the dealership worked very hard to make it work for us. The thing I liked about the whole experience was  that although there is always  give  and take at a car dealership (as car dealers have to make money too) I never felt it was an ESPN poker match with bluffing and sunglasses. Sometimes we as the customer come in to a dealership with unreasonable expectations and the dialogue to get us down to reality is part of life. We all would love to trade in Accents for Sante Fe's straight but it just doesn't happen. That is when I go back to my statement my feeling that the Texan Hyundai people are genuine and sincere in helping the customer. This sounds more like a commercial right now but unlike many people that are briefly in a car dealership  I got to spend more time there than most and got to learn more about the people there and  what kind of people they were. So thumbs to everyone from top to bottom. My wife and I will return again in a few years and try this process again. We will remain loyal to Texas Hyundai despite the fact that we are now about 45 minutes away. ",5.0

At the end of my service he helped me with some concerns I had with still learning about my new Huyndai.He saw to it that I was completely satisfied with the service before I left and to call or come by if I had any other concerns. The entire staff is a very friendly and seemingly closeknit. I like that and I will by pass a few other dealers closer to me to come to Texan Huyndai.,5.0
800,"June 03, 2013",I believe my sales rep worked out the best price to win my business.  He was honest and direct.  He was patient and informative when I came to the dealership knowing nothing about Hyundai's.  I didn't feel like I was forced into playing any sort of negotiating game like another dealership tried with me (the other dealership obviously didn't get my business).,5.0

811,"April 20, 2013","The best car buying experience of my life (over 40 years of owning vehicles).  The sales person was amazing and was more concerned with making sure I got the car that would be right for me than ""just selling"" me a car.  I felt confident that everyone at Texan Hyundai was committed to getting me the best deal and making the process as fast and pleasant as possible.  I will come back to this dealership and my salesperson for all future purchases.  ",5.0
812,"April 18, 2013","My service advisor always has a smile in his voice when I call with a question, an issue or to tell him I'll be late for my appointment. He helps me chose the right service for my lifestyle (i.e. I'm always late for an oil change so he suggested I chose an oil that ""lasts longer"")  He lets me know if there are other issues that need to be address and quickly gives me a quote. I never feel pressured to make a decision.  

Steve and his fellow service advisor's work well as a team so if Steve has stepped away Mike is right there to assist me.  If I'm in need of a loaner car they try their best to accommodate me.  And lastly, Steve (and the guys) have never commented on the fascinating items that litter the interior of the car at any given time:)  They are all exceptionally nice and courteous. ",5.0

All the work that has been done on my car as been perfect no complaints. I noticed that Texan Hyunda was the number 1 service center the reson for that is they put the customers needs first, the employees that work in service is the main reason they win the awards.

He made sure the car was exactly how I wanted before I left. Sunni had also been in contact with me during the day about financing and she was super nice and I really enjoyed speaking with her. She made everything go so smooth with no problems. Josh took me for a test drive and he answered all my questions I had about the car.

834,"September 12, 2011","I have purchased a used car an 05 model with less then 55000 miles on it, when I drove it home I've noticed it started making noise coming from the front passager side. called the sales person and gotten the round-around. I end up going to the dealer and gotten it fixed (cost me 500. Shortly after that I have been in a car accident and My new car got totaled. I have contacted the dealer once again to cancelled my gap and extended warranty that have purchased when I bought the car. First I spoke with Peter VI (finance manager)and he asked for few documents To proceed the canceling process, He advised me it will take two weeks...... A month had past and nothing, no phone call,no Email,no check!. I have called him and emailed him several times and after several tries I got an email back for me to contact Deborah from accounting. When I called here she had NO CLUE what what was going on and that peter never forward her my file and was assuring me that she will take care of it ASAP. and I was going to get a call back by the end of the day once she call the extended warranty company and get an amount. so I had to send all the documents all over again and waited. another week past and nothing. I called and called and no answer. I have contacted the Insurance company directly and was told that nothing was filed!!!! buyers beware those people appear nice but they are out to get your money. they dont stand behind their cars! and def dont care about repeat business! save yourself the headache and go somewhere else.

835,"June 05, 2011","I purchase a Hyundai Sonata in April 2011 and was happy with the sales person and was assisting me to find the right car that I wanted. I told him I wanted a red car with black interior and the salesman kept on telling me that there is a really nice gray car out in the lot that he wanted to show me. When I saw the car I told him it is really pretty but if you can get me a red one that would be great. Well he kept on suggesting that I get the gray one. He kept on I said ok because the gray was a nice car. Then he said after you tint the windows and install a spoiler on the trunk it will look even better. When the paper work was completed I open the driver door and felt the vibrations.  I told the salesman and he opened the driver door but claimed he didn't feel any vibrations.  About 2 days later I found a scratch and a dent on the rear bumper.  I also observed that the rear passenger door there is a gap that dosen't flush with the body. I contacted the salesman and he suggested to bring the car in to be looked at.  The service department poorly painted the rear bumper, the dent is still visible, the passenger rear door is still evident of the gap, the vehicle is pulling to the left and the brake light keeps coming on in the dash area.  I brought the vehicle in about the reoccurring problems on 3 occasions and still isn't resolved.  I spoke with Mike and Alvaro regarding the existing problems.  I met again with Alvaro on Friday June 3rd and he stated he would contact me the next morning and haven't heard from him yet.  To say the least I'm a very unsatisfied customer.",2.0
