0,"November 27, 2019","Poor management. I have spent thousands at Greenway Mazda... my 2018 Mazda 6 was repaired from a collision. I needed diagnostics run and systems reset. They refused because it was ""branded"".... Pathetic excuse for incompetence. The service adviser was incompetent, did not know enough about Mazda 6 functions to discuss it with me. Poor, poor, poor.... Stay Away!!!! ",1.0

4,"December 29, 2018","Easy to work with Ceaser as we agreed on a purchase.  However, after we paid for the car, he only gave us one key.  When I asked the dealership to give me a discount to pay for a replacement key they refused.  Then they tried to cancel the deal even though all of the paperwork was done.  Very stressful dealing with Greenway Mazda.",2.2

6,"June 28, 2018","From the moment Curtis walked out to greet me, he was very courteous and professional. I told him my situation and which vehicle I was interested in. He immediately grabbed the keys to test drive the exact car I wanted. He went over a lot of the features and was able to answer my questions without hesitation. I took the car for a test drive and was ready to move forward in buying it. I told Curtis I was on a time crunch and needed to leave by a certain time. He made sure the paperwork and finance were complete in a timely manner. When we parted ways, it was before the time I had told him. 

I saw him the following Monday with the second key to my trade in. He got in my CX-5 with me and answered all my questions that came up between Saturday and then. He has since followed up with a phone call to make sure I am still satisfied with my purchase. 

I wanted to reach out because Curtis definitely deserves the positive recognition! He was professional, understanding, timely, followed through and followed up on all aspects to make this one of the best car buying experiences I've had. ",5.0

13,"April 15, 2018","I arrived at the dealership, literally limping and in pain, to check out a car my wife was interested in. I wasn't crazy about the cost of the vehicle, even though it was priced fairly, I'm just frugal and it was little bit more than I want pay. I immediately was greeted by Mr. Curtis White. He was very pleasant and helpful and remained so in spite of my less than reasonable, in my estimation, offer. I was shocked because normally salesman become arrogant and negative at that point like you've insulted their mother at which point I find the exit. In summation if you're in the market for a car new or used, and they have it in stock,  don't hesitate to stop in and make a reasonable or unreasonable offer. I don't think you will regret it.",5.0

17,"April 10, 2018","I was online Sat night browsing different sites and looking for a Chrystler 300. I submitted a few requests to dealers.  Ibrahim from Greenway called me within 15 min.  He did not push but confirmed he had a car in stock and wanted to ask if I would like to see it Monday.  Upon arriving at the dealership Ibrahim was outside waiting for me and greeted me instantly.  He did the standard sales pitch and test drive but also went out of his way to ensure I was happy and that all my questions were answered.  I had a few requests that I came with and with a short discussion with Kevin, they were all answered to my satisfaction.  I then met Tony who worked with me on financing.  I had a couple of blemishes on my history and he found what I consider decent financing.  I picked the car up today. It was detailed to the point that my friend dropping me off commented on how great it looked.  I felt the standard sales pressure you would get anywhere but I never felt cornered or pushed into anything I did not want or felt I needed.  From my experience, it is clear that they want more people to come to buy and are taking the steps in customer service to get us coming back.  

Great Job to Kevin and the team of Ibrahim and Tony.  Thank You!!!!, ",5.0

I also want to give a giant thank you to a partner and GM, Steve. He made sure to be right by Ibrahim's side to make sure we were getting the most efficient and best help we could get. Thank you all so much ",5.0
25,"March 21, 2018","Thomas was the most pleasant car salesman I have ever dealt with. His knowledge of the car and the brand was next to none. His breakdown of the price made negotiation a breeze: Absolutely a pleasure to work with. Will absolutely seek him out for any future needs. 

The finance person was the opposite. Wouldn’t finance through Mazda again. Spent hours saying the same answers over and over. Finally had to try to leave. Finance at your credit union and go buy from Thomas.",4.2

42,"February 10, 2018","This dealership is amazing! I worked with Craig (salesman) and Kevin (sales manager). They were both extremely patient and helpful, and not pushy whatsoever. I was able to compare many cars before deciding on the AMAZING 2018 Mazda CX-5. They both helped me get a great price (I’m a teacher on a budget), and the process was fun! I was able to walk in at 9:30 AM, trade in my car, and leave with my new Mazda, tagged & titled (by their office- wonderful not having to do this at the tag office), and financed by 12:30 PM. I would 100% recommend this dealership! ",5.0

44,"February 07, 2018","I don't like buying cars because you spend your whole day at the dealership. Greenway Mazda was great, I saw the car online, went to see it in person, and loved it. Finance office explained everything quickly & thorough and I wasn't there all day, just about 4hrs or less. Ask for Curtis White when you go to Greenway Mazda.",4.8
45,"February 05, 2018","I have nothing bad to say about the dealership or the employees. Rashad was great and very knowledgeable about the vehicle I was interested in. I had many questions and he was able to answer them or willing to find someone who could. Rashad was very friendly and helpful and a pleasure to work with. While at Greenway Mazda I did not feel like I was getting tricked or a bad deal. In fact, I was given the best deal I had been offered for my vehicle in comparison to other dealerships. Mr. Welker in finance was very patient and kind. He gave me many options and was able to get me the deal I wanted. I truly felt that all of the staff sincerely had my best interest at heart and that was very comforting. ",5.0
46,"February 03, 2018","My review goes for first time car buyers. Experience was great! I knew what i wanted and they help me out to get it. I didnt go home with my new vehicle till 11pm and Curtis was there to the end of my deal. He was attentive and answer all my questions. I had some doubts but they were cleared by him with a very sincere answer. It not always true when they say sales people are looking to just get you into a bad deal. Before i came to Greenway Mazda, I have visited several and several dealers and couldnt compare their service to the others. Service was exceptional! Thank you Curtis for helping me achieve on getting a car",4.8
47,"February 02, 2018",Rashad was awesome! He really helped answer all my questions and was very patient with me. Since this was my first car I didn’t really know what to expect but he made it so easy and I ended up leaving with my very first car!,5.0

49,"January 30, 2018","I'm very happy with the experience I had - and my car! I went into Greenway Mazda with the hopes of test driving a CX-5 to make sure it could fit into my (very narrow) driveway. I expected the usual ""push"" from the sales staff to talk about exactly what I was looking for and what I'd be willing to spend, and I was open to the idea of making a purchase that day. I found my salesperson, Karim, to be both friendly and patient with me. I was a bit annoyed that he asked to run a credit inquiry before we took a test drive, but I understood they wanted to know how serious of a buyer I might be. Both he and his sales director seemed pretty intent on talking through financials before we went for a drive. I was fine with this, but I had to be very clear about the fact that it would all be moot if the vehicle did not comfortably fit in my driveway.

I went back-and-forth with the sales manager a couple times, and he was able to come up with a deal that included a pretty hefty trade-in allowance for my 2012 Civic. We agreed on a purchase price (non-binding) that I was happy with, and Karim headed with me to my house to test the car. It fit! Once we returned to the dealership, he worked quickly to get me through the rest of the process. Overall, I found him to be patient, knowledgeable, and able to establish a good rapport with me. I should note, however, that much of my positivity stems from the fact that the vehicle actually fit. I would have been quite upset if we had to do all the negotiating and it turned out to be a waste of time. A credit check before test driving with the sales person really isn't necessary. I'm sure Karim would have held off on that if I was firm about testing the vehicle first, but I was fine with talking financials anyway. 

In the end, I am incredibly happy with my choice; it's a great fit for my lifestyle - and my driveway!

PROS: Friendly & knowledgeable staff, positive environment, fair trade-in allowance, superior product

CONS: Credit check & Financial agreement before test drive, too pushy in the back office on the extended warranty (I stood my ground, but I had to say ""no"" about 4 times)",4.2
50,"January 29, 2018",Drove in from Austin because Greenway Mazda offered the best price. I was very pleased with Craig's respectfulness and attentiveness. The buying experience could not have been easier. I am recommending Craig and Greenway Mazda to my friends and family.,5.0

52,"January 25, 2018","Lulu Taleb was very professional and attentive during my search for a new Mazda vehicle. I have had several Mazda vehicles over the last two decades and my leasing experience with Lulu was by far, the most satisfying. However, I would like to constructively comment on the service manager, Steve Hwang... there seemed to be several disconnects with Steve relating to the incentives associated with returning my previous Mazda CX-5, which resulted in confusion and insufficient credits toward the leasing of my new vehicle. Also, I had issues with the wait time transition prior to meeting with the finance manager . Unfortunately, the wait time was attributed to computer issues; which resulted in the finance manager postponing the lease signing for two days. Upon my return to Greenway Mazda, I had to wait several minutes again before meeting with a second finance manager. During the review and signing, there were several discrepancies on the lease contract, not covered by the sales manager; but the finance manager was able to ammend the lease contract accordingly. Conclusively, all managers were very apologetic and mase the necessary corrections, which ultimately regained my faith... thus, resulting in overall positive experience and earning high marks. ",5.0

56,"January 23, 2018","It was a very good experience in buying my car from Greenway Mazda. The sales person, Rashad Brown, was easy going and knowledgeable on the vehicle. I am a high-tech professor and know cars quite well and used to work on my own British, Italian, and Japanese Sports cars. I can spot sales person ""technical"" bulls*t a light year sway. I have no problem walking away from a dealership when being BS and pressured. Rashad was quite professional, helpful and refreshingly relax without the common high pressure sales tactics. The sales manager  Kevin was also easy to work with and straightforward. . I did not waste much time in the whole buying process that was quite pleasant. During the vehicle delivery, Rashad was quite conscientious and  patient in setting up the infotainment system and taught us to do so at the same time. He paired up the blue tooth connections with our phone despite some idiosyncracies with one of the phone. I would highly recommend Rashad Brown as a sales person. Another thing I appreciated was that  this dealership has a well-stocked inventory of cars to choose from, that I can find exactly what I needed in terms of options, color, etc. It seems to have a beefier inventory than other Mazda dealerships I had visited.

He knows his job well and will find you what you are looking for in your budget. I will always buy and recommend to buy cars from
Him.... just be careful of the finance department... they promised us a lower interest rate finance and when we sat down to sign the papers they said we got approved for higher interest rate (despite have excellent credit score)... when I said we will not go through the deal they immediately changed their interest rate to a lower one the agreed on and said another bank was ready to finance that rate.....this is very fishy and unprofessional...... more or less the overall experience was great..",4.2

The insurance company had not received the paper work but said we could cancel those policies at any time and I should talk to the dealership manager. I tried multiple times to reach the manager but he was always in a meeting or at lunch. Finally the receptionist asked if she could help.

Then they negotiated with me to buy a vehicle or do an exchange with my vehicle. I told them very clearly that I was not there for buying or exchanging a vehicle.

We are just starting the process, so we are going around to dealerships for test drives to get a feel for the cars and their features.

We went to Greeenway Mazda at about 1:30 on a Friday and met Lee Simpson.   Of course, we didn't know his name at this point as he did not introduce himself.  But I explained that we would like a test drive and which cars we had narrowed our search to.  We went to the lot and found a Mazda3 to test.  We had a short, silent test drive along the feeder.  The test drive was basically down the feeder to the first light, take the turnaround, take the next turnaround and back to the dealership.  During the entire test drive, I felt that Lee didn't want us there and that he didn't really want to give us a test drive.  Almost like he was being inconvenienced by giving us a test drive.

At the end of the test drive, he said, ""You got what you needed?"".  I just wanted to go at that point.  So I said, ""Yes, sir.  Thank you."" and we left.  The only reason I know his name is because he gave us his card right before we left.  He never explained any of the features of the car, showed us anything about the car, or expressed any interest in what we were looking for in a new vehicle.

After doing the whole process of paperwork including application for credit check the dealership finance person returned with final price quote $2000 more than the agreed upon price. Apparently there is a required ""complimentary"" service package for 12 months covering car wash and oil change worth $1900 which was added to the cost. And the manager that had initially agreed to the deal has left the dealership. The general manager's rationalization was ""why didn't you buy the car at that time? Mazda promotions change all the time and we cannot honor the previous agreed upon price."" He completely ignored the fact that cost change is due largely to this ""complimentary"" package.

I was then told the car was sold the exact day after I spent an entire day trying to put down a deposit.

133,"September 14, 2016","I took my car to this dealership because I needed 3 new tires urgently and they were the only ones who could take me in right away (little did I know the reason for that)

The technician put on the new tires, balanced them, ""test drove"" the vehicle and sent me on my way. As soon as I was on the freeway and the speed was over 55 my car started shaking like crazy. I went back to the dealership but the technician had left, I guess he was in a hurry to leave. Also, when I reversed this strange screeching noise started coming from the car, something I never had before in the three years I have owned the car.

Came back the next day and was told the balancing was not right and they rebalanced the tires. Was also told the reverse screeching had nothing to do with the work they did (even though it never happened before and whatever rebalancing they did made the noise go away) and said it must have been the dew. Well I park in a parking garage on the 4th floor and somehow the dew decided to only mess with my car the day after I took it to their dealership, but whatever....

Drove out again and the shaking was better but still there and the car felt completely different than when I got the tires changed. I took the car back to them and was told there is nothing they can do about it and the shaking was happening because the ""rim was bent"". I guess they wanted me to buy  new rim and somehow the ""bent"" rim never affected the car before.

Anyways, I decided to cut my loses and drove straight from there to NTB. They were able to balance the tires correctly, they also said nothing was wrong with my rim and it was not bent. Now my car feels and drives like normal again.

I would not be taking my car for service to this dealership ever again if they can not even handle a simple balancing and instead of admitting the issue keep blaming circumstances and other car parts for it. I came out with more issues with my car with what I went in with and had to spend additional money getting my tires balanced which should be a basic and professional service provided when you buy new tires.

Additionally two weeks later I've been told the spare key cannot be located.

150,"February 15, 2016","Wife and I had to fly into Houston to help daughter with the purchase of her first new vehicle. 
We had a couple ideas about what she wanted to drive and put together a list of dealerships to check out. After hours of research about vehicles, dealerships, etc., we arrived in Houston armed with as much information about what we would purchase and from what dealership.
After a couple dealership visits we stopped at Greenway Mazda,  and made up our minds that this was the place to purchase. Their 'vibe', if you will, left us at ease knowing that we would have our needs and wants addressed to our satisfaction.
Their knowledge, professionalism, friendliness and understanding of our budget, saw us driving off their lot with a spanky new Mazda 3!
Salesman Keith, receptionist, finance gal, director of sales, even the parts manager treated us like family. 
As my wife and I depart back to California, we are comforted by the fact that our daughter is in a great car at an affordable price with the support of Greenway Mazda if she should ever need them.
I have no stake in this business, this is my honest experience over the Presidents' Day weekend. ",5.0
151,"February 04, 2016","Came in for a recall fix and oil change. I had a coupon from this same dealer that offered Free Lifetime oil changes. ""FREE Lifetime Oil Changes. Don't forget that as a thank you for purchasing your new Mazda from Greeneater Mazda you receive FREE Lifetime Oil Changes"".  Instead of honoring the coupon, both the Service Manager and the General Manager refused to recognize the offer. Instead, both blamed the previous owner and Mazda directly for having erroneously mailing out the coupon. The GM said that he did not feel obliged to honor the previous owners coupon. He also claimed that even if Mazda was responsible for the error that they would also not honor the certificate. 

Mazda, what do you have to say?  I say ""false advertising"" and/or bait and switch. Is this what I can expect from Mazda and its dealers going forward?  Perhaps I have bought my last Mazda. ",1.3

155,"November 28, 2015","While looking for a reputed Mazda dealership in the Houston area, I was referred by Mazda corporate to contact the Greenway dealership. I was extremely lucky to have been helped by Kevin Brunetti who takes customer service to an entirely different level. He is not only very informative and polite, but most importantly puts his customers at the heart of what he does. Kevin explained to me all the tiny bit of details with utmost clarity and patience and kept me updated with progress at each stage. In short my experience was seamless. I would highly recommend Kevin to anyone who is looking to buy a Mazda in the Houston area. In addition to this the entire team at the Greenway dealership works like a family where customer experience is top-notch!

156,"November 11, 2015","Buyers beware. I went to this Dealership on 7/7/2015 to purchase a 2015 Mazda 6. There were two vehicles I was interested in. One was listed at $16977 and had 28k miles, and the other was going for $17477 and had 33k miles. Both of these vehicles were supposed be CPOs. I first looked at the one with 28k miles, and found that the lever that lifts the driver's seat (up/down) was broken along with the arm rest. So I ruled that one out. I then look at the second car and found the same problem (up/down lever broken). I also asked the reason for the difference in price, and no one could answer it.
I have always been wary about previous rental cars, and this just confirmed it. I also thought that a CPO car is supposed to go through 150 points inspection including the interior. I guess this dealership does not take that seriously.
I then decided to opt for a 2014 Mazda 6 that had 20k miles and was list a $19998. I tested the car with the salesperson who showed total disinterest in showcasing the car. My wife and I had to tell him to tell us about the features. When I said to him ""you don't talk much do you?” his response was” I am just sitting back here enjoying the ride..."" What?
So I offered a price which was accepted, then I signed the paperwork, got insurance for the car and went to financing. I supplied my credit scores beforehand, which averaged at around 730. Because of the discount they gave on the price of the car, they decided to jack up the interest rate to 5% when I was putting at least 8k down. I actually thought that the finance lady was joking until I saw that she was really serious.
Of course I walked out, because this interest rate is even higher than my current mortgage. Furthermore I purchased an Acura MDX a few months earlier at 1.9%. I am actually better off buying a new car and getting 0%.
We are extremely disappointed because my wife really liked the car, and we wasted an entire afternoon talking to these guys. Needless to say, that this was the worse experience I have had from a dealership in 25 years. 
Just got a loan from my Credit Union. I guess I should have done that first.

157,"October 02, 2015","I recently purchased a certified preowned Mazda 3 from Greenway.   Negotiated all of the details by email/phone from home in Louisiana and then flew to Houston on cheap Southwest flight Houston, they picked me up at airport and took me to dealership to sign papers and drive car home.    The car was exactly as stated and could not have been happier with the money I saved over buying in Louisiana.   Overall a stress free experience, and thanks to Kevin again for picking me up at airport!",5.0
158,"September 21, 2015","I found this dealer from an online car listing that I was interested in, I live in San Antonio. Requested the car fax report for the car I was interested in and at first was sent a link that required a user name and password to log in to a system. Second time I was sent the carfax for the wrong vehicle. Finally I found the link on the dealer website, but it was about mid-way through the page and kind of hard to find.  Working with Rachelle and Drew went fairly well. Rachelle was good about quickly answering my questions and was good to my friend who went to check the vehicle out in person for me.

Once I said I wanted to purchase the vehicle that's when everything went down hill. Funny enough. I really felt that I was a bother to Elhadji. Drew told me that they could drive the car to me with the paperwork and I could send it all back with the driver, Elhadji said no. Which would have been fine, except the day he said the papers would be going out somehow the overnight service didn't come to pick up mail that day. I finally get the paperwork and am able to put it back in the mail the next day except this delivery service doesn't deliver on Saturdays. Fine, but Elhadji should get it Monday morning. I track it and see it's delivered at 10:30, but by 11 I still haven't heard from Elhadji. I call to make sure he gets it and leave a message. By 12:30 I still haven't heard anything from anybody at Greenway. I call Drew and tell him that the package has been there since 10:30 that morning can he please do something. By 2:30 I still haven't heard anything so I call again and leave a message. Finally get a call back from Drew just before 3 and I won't be getting my car until noon tomorrow.

Plenty of other people seem to have a good experience with this dealership so I think if you are in front of them they do well. But if doing things over the phone then they don't seem to care. Which I don't understand, isn't a sale a sale? Maybe put the finance people on commission as well so they care about getting the deal done as well. Elhadji was a black hole and even when I was speaking to him I felt like I was bothering him and he had other more important things to do.

*UPDATE* After my review posted, Drew called and offered me a gas card, to make up for my bad experience. I would recommend having a company wide meeting to stress the importance of internal communication and providing a consistent message to the customer.",3.5

We chatted for a few minutes about what we wanted and then Mr. Dean passed us off to his sales guy Bryan Naghi.  Mr.Naghi was equally pleasant and put us at ease as to moving forward in selecting a car, test driving it, sharing his knowledge to us about the vehicle, and then final negotiation and purchase.  Due to the fact that the car that we wanted was not in inventory at Greenway, the dealership had to search and acquire the vehicle which took about a day.  All during this process, Mr. Dean had called me to let me know what the status was.  As the vehicle came in the next day, I went out to the dealership to finalize the paperwork with their Finance Manager (Treon Simmons) which again was a pleasant experience.  Lastly, since I was unable to drive the car home (I was in my car), the dealership went out to pick up my wife the next day from home so that she could drive the car home.
