He is a good salesman. I also have to give props to the Sales Manager and the Finance Manager, both great guys who kept up with me with my new car and my trade in. ",4.4
1,"March 17, 2020","Had an appointment that I went in for.  Online appointment indicated that have issue with tire pressure notice that would not go off.  I got there and they didn't have extended warranty info so they couldn't tell me if it was covered under warranty or not but I would have to pay for $150 diagnostic fee no matter what.  Had I have known this I would not have driven 1.5 hours to have it serviced since this is the closest Kia to my home.  I went ahead and got oil changed and my mileage at the time was 60,450 but the paper work indicated that my mileage is 47,048.  They of course tried to tell me that I needed about $700 more in work to have brake fluid, cabin filter, etc...changed.  I will never return to this dealership and will go somewhere else to have my Kia worked on.",2.2
2,"January 21, 2020",Got a vehicle there and they did not give me a payment back that they said they would and got my address wrong even when they asked me 3 times what it was. I will never buy anything from them again. They were very incompetent.,1.0

4,"August 08, 2019","Hi Efran
I am writing in reference to my recent purchase (6 months) now of 2019 KIA SOUL. It is with great regret of becoming a customer of Kia that this is in reference to. I purchased my car through your salesman Valerie that was employed by you during the sale. After working with Valerie she truly sold herself through the misinformation that she shared with me, WOW GREAT BENEFITS of becoming a new car owner for PARKWAY FAMILY KIA. After giving her my information, she called me back a couple of days later and asked when can I come in, I made an appointment with her, got there late, almost dark. I sat in her office we immediately began paper work, well I am thinking that we are going to walk the parking lot and browse vehicles, at that time be allowed to choose what I like. That didn‚Äôt happen.  The car that I am driving is what she chose, it was already parked in the front of the dealership in a handicap parking spot, she stated let‚Äôs go for a test drive. At that time I said to myself well maybe this is a test drive car, lol.  When we returned, she showed me while sitting in the car how to connect my phone through Bluetooth ‚ÄòWOW‚Äù after that we proceeded inside to complete paper work. I asked what else was available she did not answer me DUH your car is outside that was chosen for you OKAY!!  I was walked to finance to sign papers, and instructed to go back over to the sales department for KIA. At that time my car was parked in front with the driver door opened.  I returned for my first oil change and service, realized that you all had the 2020 KIA so I asked about it, spoke with a couple of people didn‚Äôt get any clarity, and I wanted to know if I could choose the basic model of the 2020 which is what I really liked and had the color that I wanted. I left, called back during the week and spoke with someone in internet sales and was assured that I could switch out of what I did not want into what I really wanted. Well that didn‚Äôt happen, she made it sound so easy. ? If it were explained I would not have traveled back down there. Moving forward I was introduced to another salesman that was very rude, unprofessional, and only asked you have money, how much money do you have for a down payment? Not ma‚Äôam can I offer to show you the 2020‚Äôs and what is available? Hmmm too much like right? Were sales down? There was nothing offered complimentary offered while I sat there. It took forever, I decided to walk outside and browse the parking lot, he then showed up and handed me some papers and told me I needed to work on my credit and come back in 2 years. WOW  Is said that‚Äôs it after I was assured that I would be able to  switch my vehicle/ he said no one will finance you. I am aware of my credit for sure, that‚Äôs why I wanted to finance to help build my score. I returned to get a 2nd oil change, and inquired about the same vehicle with Stacey she was helpful and promising as well HIT me with another application that dropped my score once again, ok now I‚Äôm a 3 time looser with this denial thing lol, I had other obligations so I left and just asked her to call me, unfortunately I had to call her/well text her. She responded through all text messages.  I do have an increase in income that was the only change from the previous application. LONG STORY SHORT my note is paid on time, I am very disappointed in the way that I was treated and feel as though‚Ä¶.. the salesman here is what you get, nothing else, take it or leave it!!! Not a good feeling! Just wanted to feel that my investment is worth me coming back of referring someone else to the dealership. Very unfortunate but true.  
Sincerely,
Unhappy Disgusted Customer

5,"July 26, 2019"," Sales guy would not let us test drive a vehicle on their lot. Guy said the vehicle is paid for by another customer, but if we were able to out bid that person then we could test drive. Sales guy pretty much stated, my fiancee and I didn't have the money to afford the vehicle, which is not the case at all. We walked away and sales manager came up and wanted to try and make up for it.. negative ghost rider.  Poor experience,  sales guy can't sell cars.. they're definitely biased. Do not go there for business!!",1.0
6,"July 24, 2019",My husband Calvin and I had been all around Humble and wasn't happy until we went to Oarkway Kia. Very nice very honest very clean very professional.  The best Saleman in history is Shaun Collins .Thanks for my 2019 Kia Optima,5.0
7,"July 18, 2019"," Daughter brought car in for recall. Letter stated there would be no charge. David the service advisor told her she needed throttle body cleaning in order to properly do recall. Cost was $120. Local mechanics will do it for $65  he also stated they recommend cleaning every  15,000 to 30,000 miles. Spoke with mechanics and looked online. Most recommend 60,000 or more miles unless having problem. Parkway Kia service is a rip off. Will never come back again.",1.0

10,"April 15, 2019","Very rude and unprofessional service employee who wouldn't take ""NO"" for an answer concerning the additional service that he was trying to sell. All we wanted was the ""oil change"". After repeatedly expressing our desire he mentioned they wouldn't preform the rest of the service on the check list that's normally done anyway. After that brief exchange I asked for my keys back and left. Don't have to worry about us returning to that dealer and will not recommend it to anyone else. Have a great day.",1.0

13,"September 11, 2018","Made an appointment for an oil change. Got there 10 minutes early. After 2 hours, the car was ready. They say that the appointment time is like a doctors office visit. That is when you can speak to the service advisor, not when we are going to work on your car. Whaaaat? Then they added a tire rotation to tires that were just purchased. Padded the bill really well $25 to rotate brand new tires that we get for free when it is time from Discount Tire. ",1.6

16,"January 19, 2018","DON'T BUY HERE!!! I cannot get anyone to actually send off my tags (as they said they would) in a timely manner or to the correct depts. Come 2.5 months later and I still have no tags. The guys in ""finance"" said he was ""too busy"" to handle though he was the one who assured it would be done, and done in a timely manner. Now I am having to get creative and possibly drive 8 hours to let the DMV inspect my car. All because they took 1.5 months to send it out. Despite me asking while I was available in town and offering to go down to DMV myself, which they assured was not necessary. Only good parts were Linda Muhammad in Sales and Krystal in Customer Service (so far).  I would take the car back in a heart beat. These people at Parkway Family Kia (mostly DAN) are unprofessional and have no working knowledge of processing tags nor customer service. But to be fair I have been passed to the next person for so long I believe I am being passively ""handled"" by the sales manager Muhammed. Also the individual responsible for tags is instructing me to register the tags illegally. In full summary, they don't care after they get you to sign on the dotted line. Mostly 2 hour lunches and not being able to get the AL DMV office phone number (that took 3 weeks...hint you can look it up online; but he was busy so I gave it to him) and trying to register the ""easy"" (but illegal) way is in their interests. Don't do it! Don't Do It!!! DON'T DO IT!!!! If you were thinking the sales group is great and it would be a great fit - DON'T DO IT!!! After the sale they don't follow through or care at all. Check out Yelp reviews and they have a horrible history. I would NEVER recommend this dealership to anyone, not even worst enemy. I will have to take my vehicle elsewhere for service because if this portion is taken with so much care I can only imagine how long they will keep the car running. ",1.0
17,"September 25, 2017",Richard sucked when it came to custmer service. The dealer rapped my husband and I $2300.00 worth for something we didn't have a problem with before letting them fix the warranty issue. ,1.0
18,"September 19, 2017",This dealership is a joke. The service department does not know the meaning of service. Richard and Brent are managers and they could care less once you buy a car. ,1.0

20,"March 21, 2017","They lied, they lost my keys, they were rude, the so called ""highest up"" guy as he called it, had the audacity to try and sell me a car for way more then any other place that I went after he lost my keys and made me miss my tow. Awful person. These people are crooked. If you want honesty this is definitely not be place for you. ",1.2
21,"February 27, 2017",Just purchased a 2017 Kia Sorento EX.  Lovely vehicle.  Everyone employee we worked with was well groomed and courteous.  All employees seemed to go the extra mile to help us.  Especially impressed with Mark White.  Low key little pressure sales pitch.  I did not feel pushed to make a decision on my purchase.  Thanks to all that helped us today including Casey Tong in finance,4.8

23,"January 17, 2017","Stay away from this dealer!!!! I made a mistake and purchased a vehicle from KIA. They are so unprofessional. When I purchase the vehicle they put wrong information on the bill of sale paper (Vehicle model, year, VIN number etc. I have been waiting for them to fix this issue so I can register my vehicle. I talked to 2 managers about it (Mr. Khan and Mr. Efren) and left voices but they did not even care and try to solve it. It was a totally disappointment experience for me. I do not recommend this dealer to anyone.",1.0

32,"August 03, 2016",The customer service at Parkway was awesome! Miya and Desmond worked as a great team to get me in my new 2016 Kia Soul. I was treated like family and they understood my budget and my fears of not having a car note in five years. I had three other dealerships to visit after Parkway but had no need because I was well taken care of at Parkway. ,4.8
33,"July 16, 2016","I had an Amazing experience at Parkway family Kia! I went to dealerrater and saw the amazing reviews for Linda Muhammad and that's when I contacted her! From the moment I was on the phone with her all the way to the final sale she was wonderful! She truly listens and cares for her customers! There was no pressure to buy or feeling rushed, I felt more than comfortable and I will definitely comeback to her in the future. Linda you have made a longtime customer! Thank you!",5.0
34,"May 28, 2016",Linda Muhammad was excellent as my sales consultant as were the other associates that were involved in making this sale. Look forward to going back for service.,5.0
35,"March 31, 2016","They say fortune favors the bold. Well, I guess going out of my way to drive to Kingwood and visit Parkway Family Kia when there were Kia dealers a lot closer to home was bold enough. I shopped several dealers, and after much deliberation, decided to go with them in spite of their distance. From the moment I first called and talked to Miyon Oh (aka ""Miya"", whose lovely voice was matched by her very friendly demeanor) to the moment where they agreed to a favorable price via email (thank you to sales manager Efran Taylor) to my arrival and subsequent interaction with sales rep Curt Lee to my easy and stress-free interaction with finance manager Don (forgot his last name. Sorry Don), every single step felt like I was dealing with people whose priority was seeing me happy in a new car and not trying to work me over.  This is how car buying should be. I drove away with a new Sorento today and was very happy I made the out-of-the-way trip to their store to get it. 

The lesson here is that if you shop your dealers to find the ones with cordial personnel and a genuine interest to work with you, do your homework and make sure you know what you want and how to ask for it, then treat the people you deal with like human beings, chances are you'll have a great experience. I definitely recommend working with these folks if/when you're in the market for a new car.",5.0
36,"March 21, 2016","Ms. Linda has sold me my first and now my second car.  She was very knowledgeable, honest and very patient.  She helped me and worked with me until i left satisfied.  I would refer anyone to her,she is great",5.0
