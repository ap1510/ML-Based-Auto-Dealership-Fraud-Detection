0,"June 10, 2020","I was very disappointed in the way your dealership did business this past weekend.  I drove from Laredo, Texas to buy a used Ford mustang posted online. I made an appointment and drove 2 hours and 45 minutes from Laredo to buy the vehicle. I also took the day off of work. The internet manager called me when I was on the road to make sure I was going to make the appointment. Upon arrival I was notified that the vehicle was going to be sold wholesale. I was upset considering I lost a day off of work,fuel and time. I then requested to speak with manager. I approached the manager Chris to address my concern, his response was I'm on a phone call and I dont want to lose my spot. I proceeded to voice my concern and he apologized while waiting on the phone. I was not his concern obviously since his phone call was more important than a would be customer. I am very disappointed with vw of alamo heights if I could give a negative star rating I definitely would.

1,"September 19, 2019","We just bought our 2nd new vehicle from them. Not going to lie.It started off on a bad foot, however the team rallied together and made us beyond happy. Unpleasant experiences will happen from time to time. What is most important is how they are handled. Oscar, Charles, the managers Chris and Ron, and the GM Tim went well out of their way to make sure were taken care of and excited about the buying experience. They all put in countless hours to make the deal happen.",5.0

Excellent employee. ",5.0
3,"May 22, 2019","If you consider buying a vehicle from this dealership be very, very careful and review everything in detail.  My husband and I attempted to purchase a used vehicle paying cash.  We were told at the very beginning of the transaction, and prior to a test drive, the vehicle was a certified pre-owned and came with a 2yr/24K warranty.  We were told this again later in the transaction while negotiating price, and also when we came to pick up the vehicle.  As we were signing paperwork and right before writing the check I asked to see the warranty in writing.  At that time everyone acted like they didn't know what we were talking about and after we became upset and demanded the paperwork be shredded in front of us they admitted they took the warranty off because of the price they agreed to sell the vehicle to us.  Very underhanded practices at this dealership.  BTW we waited 2 1/2 hours for something that was supposed to take 30 minutes while they hatched this little plan.  Be very cautious.  Dealerships can be very scary with their practices.",1.4
4,"November 30, 2018","Completely unprofessional. Long story short, we reached a deal over the phone (  I live out of state) was approved financially, was told to call back the next day to complete the purchasing. So I canceled a hold of $500 on another car ( non-refundable) and low and behold, vw of Alamo dodged my calls the next day and sold it later that night. I seriously think they are complete  xxxx bags and I I hope they stub their toes late at night. But seriously, this place sucks. Not only because they sold the car we had an agreement on, also because they had  zero urgency with everything. One guy told me North Carolina bbq was better than Texas bbq, too. I thought Texans loved their bbq. That sums it up. Garbage. ",1.0

26,"September 02, 2017",From inception there was one on one service given. Mr. Kraft took the time to listen to our needs and then present the options that most closely met our desires. Once we established availability we narrowed down our selection compared the two top choices. This dealership truly demonstrated their commitment on ensuring that  we left fully satisfied with our purchase and not settle with any regrets. In the end we walked out soon thereafter with keys in hand and extremely satisfied with our purchase.,4.8

37,"May 30, 2016",I am completely satisfied with my buying experience with JD De La Rosa. He did everything he could to make sure I was not only happy with the vehicle but that it was exactly what I wanted. Never at any point did I feel pressured to buy. In fact it was quite the opposite. He was very patient with me. I will recommend JD and the staff at Volkswagen of Alamo Heights to anyone I know wanting to buy a car and I will definitely buy from him again when looking to make another purchase. ?,5.0

39,"September 23, 2015",This place is a joke.  Don't buy a vehicle here.  I bought a low mileage used vehicle from them and car was found to have bent rims. Tried contacting Michael Davila and got no response.  Took them almost five weeks to pay off my trade and was one day shy of getting a 30 day late charge on my previous loan.  Still after over a month haven't received my plates because when they sent them out in the mail they didn't send them priority with a tracking number.  Worst dealership ever.  Buy from bluebonnet dodge next time.,1.0
40,"September 06, 2015","I purchased two cars from this dealership when it was Rod East, a 2006 GTi and a 2009 CC.  I wanted to trade both cars in on a new 2015 Golf Sportwagon. With Victoria's assistance I got an excellent deal and a fine automobile. I'm sure Bryan Pyle helped since he was my service contact from 2006 on. I do not hesitate to recommend Victoria Hammond in Sales and Bryan Pyle in Service.  I am most satisfied.",5.0
41,"August 21, 2015","This place was unbelievably great, especially our dealer; Val.  He went above and beyond, he really cares and wanted to help us whether is was late in the evening or any of the other many issues we presented.  He really worked with us to not only make the buy happen, but insure us that sometimes people really do take pride in what they do and simply want to help.  We even met with management who was also outstanding.  Thank you so much VW and Val. We will definitely be referring you as well as return in the future. ",5.0
42,"August 01, 2015","We recently purchased a 2015 Golf at this dealership.  This was the 3rd VW dealer we visited, and though all were great to work with, we really connected with Val at Alamo Heights.  Val was very personable and he gave straight, honest answers to our inquiries.  We appreciated his no pressure sales style and the fact that he was open to letting us view various cars.  In the end, we agreed on a price that we felt was very fair, and I was able to drive home in a brand new car!  ",5.0
43,"July 18, 2015",Excellent service! Ramiro guerra was our sales consultant and was patient with us while deciding which vw Jetta we wanted and kept us updated thoughout the whole process. He even threw in a free vw tshirt for my fiancé! Thanks Ramiro and the whole staff! Will recommend them!,5.0
44,"May 07, 2015","Over all I am extremely frustrated with how business was done here. I found the car i wanted after 20 minutes of being there. it took 6 hours to figure everything out. Yes... I was there 6 hours from 10 until 4pm when we finally left. First the sales rep was friendly, but he doesn't know anything about the cars I was looking at which first was a 2010 lancer, and 2nd a 2013 Golf.  Every question I asked he wasn't sure. Fine okay doesn't matter, my Father has a VW and he loves it. So I felt i could trust the dealership. Well, despite that I wanted the car. Then the salesmen who was working with me. ditched me. i dont know where he went. i didn't know who was helping me, and i didn't get any help until i went to the service counter and asked for it even then... i waited. Finally i got the car. I signed the document showing that they checked everything on the car, because they have a ""drive without worry off the lot"" policy. Well, finally we drove off the lot and what happened? the windshield wipers are busted (there was a rain that evening) and we had 2 fuses burnt out. right out of the lot. so now i can't trust them.  I get home and i dont hear anything from them about my billing, i dont know who, where, how they want me to start paying. i didn't a letter or an email. not even a phone call. so i'm sitting in limbo. i call to find out all this information and Andy the financial services guy doesn't answer or return phone calls. 3 times i called. 2 times left a message. the 4th time i was pretty livid with their service and help. i want to find out about my registration because i havent heard anything of it. i had to call again and vent my frustration for any real action to happen.  i traded in a car of coarse i didn't get much for it. but that wasn't an issue. The serves has been lousy and i do not feel satisfied or confident in my purchase. ",1.4
45,"May 27, 2014","Chivalry is not dead people!  I had the greatest experience ever this week with Julio Carmona at Volkswagon of Alamo Heights.  We were not sure what we wanted and had the poor guy running all over the place. He was patient and attentive without being pushy or overbearing throughout the whole process. He treated my parents and I with respect in every situation, whether it be communicating by text, email, or phone. He as respectful of our financing concerns and delivered specifically what we asked for.  Thank you for making this experience a good one.  We will recommend and buy again from VW of Alamo Heights, thanks to the hard work and courteous manner of Julio Carmona!",5.0
46,"December 21, 2013",Do not purchase a used vehicle from Volkswagen of Alamo Heights.  I made the mistake and I am astonished at the absolute disrespect I received from the sales and service team after the sale.   Members in management of the sales as well as the service team made me feel very uncomfortable when I wanted to accomplish what was promised to me at the time of the sale.  In my opinion this dealership is particular to new car buyers only.  I highly recommend shopping anywhere else.  The service of Volkswagen of Alamo Heights is ludicrous. ,1.4
47,"August 14, 2013",We could not have asked for a better team of sales and customer service. They have all been very helpful. The car met all of our expectations and more. Our only regret is that we didn't buy a Volkswagen sooner!,5.0
48,"July 09, 2013",The service manager (Jay Maynard) was very condescending and rude when I had a complaint about the service done to my vehicle. He made me feel like I was just a dumb customer and I didn't know what i was talking about. I have taken my vehicle there since 2009 when it was Aros East without EVER having any problems. This dealership is under construction and is just an eyesore to the customer. I will gladly take my business elsewhere.,1.8
49,"January 30, 2013","I walked into the dealership on 1/18/13 with $5000 in my pocket and I knew exactly what I was looking for; a used 2010 Jetta. I dealt with Marcey Morales in regards to my trade and the sale of a newer vehicle during the transaction. We negotiated price, payments and warrenty information. She told me she would contact me the following day to come back around 11am with my downpayment to finalize the sales contract and complete the sale. I waited for her to call and by 3pm I called the dealership and the staff told me she had gone home for the day. I hadn't heard back from her Sunday or Monday. I called her office and her personal cell on Tuesday at 10am. With several calls throughout the week I had not heard back from this girl. Finally on 1/24 I went back to the dealership to see if the vehicle was there and to see why Marcey had never returned any of my calls. At 11am I drove up to the dealership and upon walking in I saw Marcey running to the back and when I asked to see her the salesman told me she was ""out to lunch"". Then they proceeded to tell me the vehicle sold and they then attempted to try to sell me on a 2013 vehicle. At that point I walked out. I called the Internet Sales Manager (Laurie) to discuss the situation and she didn't return my call until the following day. When she did call she was very crass, condescending, rude, unprofessional and had no empathy for the issue and tried to sell me on a new vehicle, before I could even rebuttal she hung up on me. I called back and she sent me straight to voicemail. I then emailed Wes Burke (the GM of that location) to explain everything, he sent a response to my previous email 2 days late and extremly short explaining used cars are ""in high demand"". At this point based on the experience, customer service, and low level of ""street smarts"" I received from this location I have filed a formal complaint with the Better Business Bureau, I have forwarded an email and complaint with the Texas Attorney General Mr. Greg Abbott, a complaint with the Texas Business Association, and most importanly a complaint to Frank Grese (Regional Manager for Group 1 Automotive; the owners that have obtained VWofAH to their portfolio) and another complaint to Earl Hesterberg (the current CEO of Group 1 Automotive). I have sent a letter to San Antonio Express News, San Antonio Magazine and The Current to explain what type of business is being run at this local dealership. I have let Ernesto Ancira (great family friend) the Cavenders, Investigative Reporter Brian Collister of WOAI to spread the word about this location and specified not to EVER send potential clients to this location.",3.2
50,"April 11, 2012","Bait and switch. Brought new 2012 Jetta Sportwagen at a different dealer. Recently in for a check and tire rotation at 6 months, & 6400 miles. 

Mechanic claimed to find a clutch wear problem. After first assuring it was warranty work and would be done in one day, he left message on answer phone to say a certain clutch part showed excessive wear and would not be covered-- instead it would cost me over $1500 and I was to wait 2 weeks for parts! 
This is a new car that was examined by dealer service depts. 3 times since delivery in Sept., 2011. 
I found other complaints about this dealership and advise everyone to go elsewhere for a new  or used VW of for service. Dealer is known as Rod East VW and also Freedom VW. Stay away. My grievance is now with VW of North America.",2.3
51,"January 30, 2012","We bought two new cars (Tiguan and Golf R) from Rod East VW. Everyone from the sales manager (Luis) to our sales person (Mario) and the finance manager (Richard) were extremely friendly and professional. They gave us a great deal, and we could not have asked for better service from start to finish. I have bought a dozen cars, and this was easily the best sales experience I have had. I highly recommend them to anyone in Texas looking for a VW.

55,"August 27, 2011","Rod East had the right car with the right colors, especially the interior. Everyone at Rod East treated us with as friends and with respect. They worked with us to make the purchase of our new Touareg a pleasant experience. We paid more for the same car at Rod East as they had the right colors and treated us so well.",4.3
56,"August 06, 2011",I had a great experience dealing with this dealership. I read several reviews on Google tha made me hesitate a little. However once I spoke to Lori and Daniel my fears were squelched. I think the dealership could also use a little bit of additional parking.,5.0
57,"April 27, 2011",Very pleasant experience and will definitely buy my next car here also. The service I have received after the purchase has also been very exceptional. The car was delivered as promised and at the price that was quoted. Everyone at the dealership was friendly and courteous. A professional atmosphere at all levels of service. ,5.0
58,"April 20, 2011","Very Very disappointed in the quality of Used vehicles at Rod East.  They do not give their vehicles a thorough evaluation before putting them for sale.  DO NOT BUY A USED CAR FROM THESE GUYS!  They will lie to your FACE  about the quality of the vehicle just to get you to buy it.  Once you leave with the car and you find out that its not the way they portrayed and your out an additional $1000.00 in repairs, they shrug their shoulders and don't really care.

I was expertly guided through each phase of my acquisition process by the team of Esquivel and Espinosa. No question was left unawsered.

I would recommend this Dealership to anyone regardless of the Buyers knowedge.

We live about 30 minutes from the dealership and we found it easier to do everything over the phone and internet.  Even though it was done this way not a bit of service was sacraficed.

61,"April 13, 2011","I searched for a 2005 VW Passat DTI Wagon for quite some time without success. After I located the car I wanted(on the internet), I contacted Rod East VW, and was able to reach a deal after a few short back and forth negotiations, even though I did this entire transaction over the internet. Daniel Saenz was a suuperb salesman and worked with me dilligently until we had an agreement. He even sent videos and service records of the car to me via email prior to the sale. The car arrived as advertised and my wife are extremely happy with it. But the best part of Rod East Volkswagen happened just 3 days after the car was delivered. I discovered the car needed a new $535 ignition assembly and that was repaired by my local VW dealer and paid for by Rod East VW in San Antonio, Texas! Clearly, the dealership(Rod East VW) wasn't required to do so, but they stepped up and didn't even hesitate to take care of me...almost 2,400 miles away. They even paid the bill to have my car towed to the local VW dealer! I absolutely would recommend this dealership and plan on using them the next time I am shopping for a vehicle. Dado(The Sales Manager) and Daniel are the best. I am almost 59 years old, and have dealt with a lot of car dealerships in the past, but NOBODY compares to ROD EAST VOLKSWAGEN IN San Antonio, Texas!!",5.0
62,"March 30, 2011","I was searching for a very specific car when I went to Rod East.  I also went to another VW dealership.  I worked with both sales departments on identical cars.  The other dealership treated me exactly how I expect a dealership to treat me, they were very pushy and gave me the ""this deal is only good today"" line.  Paul and Lori not only found the car I wanted, they were honest about what they could and could not do on price, they put up with my constantly asking questions.  To me car buying is a big decision not to be made hastily since I have to live with that decision for at least 3-4 years.  The other dealership was all about the sale, Paul and Lori were all about getting me in the right vehicle.  Next time I need a car or anyone I know looks for a car, I will give them Paul & Lori's contact info.  I would feel comfortable sending anyone to them because of how well they treated me.    ",5.0

The experience was a good one, which is not always the case.  ",5.0
64,"March 27, 2011","Rating Rod East VW a ""1"" is far too generous, they truly deserve a rating of ""0""...AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!

First of all, my wife and I are both Active Duty Captains in the military; she's in the Army, and I'm in the AF. Secondly, we are cash-paying customers, NOT in need of financing. However, in order to test drive a car at Rod East VW in San Antonio, TX, the salesman insisted that we either put a $500 deposit on the car we were attempting to test drive, or submit an application to the finance department so they could pull a credit report... NEITHER of which I find ethical or would ever do before deciding on a car, or dealership, to give my business to. Needless to say, Rod East VW of San Antonio lost the business of cash-paying customers and gained a bad reputation that'll be spread amongst two large military circles of friends and professionals.... ""Caveat emptor""!",1.0
65,"March 16, 2011",Walked in looking for a Jetta SportWagen. I had checked their inventory online beforehand because I wasn't sure which version to buy; gas or TDI. Daniel Saenz was very helpful and patient and allowed me to test drive both versions. The TDI was the obvious best choice!,4.8
66,"March 15, 2011","After researching the new VW Jetta in my search for a car - I used the Rod East VW website to inquire about a quote and set up a test drive.  Internet Manager Lori Esquivel contacted me the next business day and we set up a test drive for the following weekend.  Lori made me feel very comfortable as we discussed what I wanted and introduced me to my sales rep, Paul Hernandez who took me for a test drive.  Paul was also very easy to talk to and told me about the Jetta and it's features.  Needless to say, after my test drive - I decided to purchase the car.

Overall impression of the Rod East VW Internet Sales team is very positive and I would definitely recommend them to friends or family.  Their follow up has also been very good!

67,"March 15, 2011","I am very satisfiled with my VW SportsWagon.  The staff at Rod East made the car buying process easy and effortless.  The pre-certified Jetta Wagon was priced right for my budget and is an excellent vehicle. Overall, I am very plesased with the car buying process and dealling with such friendly, and dedicated staff.  I would definately recommend Rod East VW to others.  Finding the right car was easy using the on-line information provided by the dealer.  I originally called another dealership for information and they did not contact me until the following day, late.  Lori called me a couple of hours after my on-line inquiry.  Being a life long resident of San Antonio, I know the reputaton of Rod East and feel fortunate things worked out for me on the first attempt.  Right car, right price, right customer service.

When I had a fender bender an independent body shop rep asked about my ""other accident"" pointing to the driver's side front and rear door. When i told him I'd been in no other accident and the car was almost new, he showed me how he could tell that it had had some pretty major body work done to it. Rod East never mentioned that. I also have a friend who bought new a Tourag, took it in for service where its roof was damaged. The only way my friend found about the roof damage was that he knew the owner of the body shop where Rod East took it for repair. Rod East didn't tell him that they had damaged his car and had taken it to a body shop for repair. Instead, they made up lies about why it was taking so long.

Customer service is always great. Specifically, Lori, Jose, Salomon and David were very helpful, also cashiers and front desk people. I had the chance to see my car in the workshop and the mechanics were also very helpful and friendly. 

I enjoy driving my VW, I had a station wagon Passat 2002 and I exchanged it for a Jetta 2007. So far I am so happy and satisfied with it and hope it stays that way. I live in Alamo Heights and teach at Northwest Vista College, I drive there everyday. It is very important for me to drive a car that is reliable, economic and safe; I find all that in a VW.

He gave us the prices of the cars, with no ""hassle or price game playing"".  I felt no pressure, felt very at ease.  The sales pitch and hassling is one of the main reasons I feel anxious about going to car dealerships.  I have to say that I was pleasantly suprised and felt very comfortable when buying my new car.

A friend recommended them to me so I decided to check them out. 
My wife and I were greeted at the door and asked if we would like a cold drink of water or coffee?  I had already made contact with the internet sales person and asked if she was available.  The sales person that took care of us was very friendly and helpful and seemed to know the product well. We took a short drive in the model that was available and decided that we wanted an A/T and a different color.  The dealership was able to locate what we wanted in just a few minutes in the Dallas/Ft. Worth Metro area and after we indicated our willingness to purchase it had it 
detailed anddelivered TO MY HOME the very next day. I still find this a little incredible. The dealership has not only sold a vehicle, more importantly they have gained a loyal customer.

Upon my arrival, I was immediately greeted by Edgar and was literally driving the Tiguan (that Lori has sitting right in front waiting for me) within about 5 minutes.   After my test drive, I guess you could say “the rest is history”.... that very next morning I was the proud owner of my new VW Tiguan!!!  
From my initial contact through my purchase, every person in the Dealership was extremely friendly and answered my multitude of questions.   In addition and most pleasantly, there was absolutely no “high pressure” for me to purchase this vehicle.  In general, I find this to be a ""rarity"" when working with car dealerships.

To the point, everytime I took the car in, Soloman provided the best customer service I've ever experienced in a dealership (FL, Germany, TX).  It is because of him that I returned to Rod East VW in order to buy a car.  At first, because of the ease-of-use of the internet, I stayed in touch with Lori in internet sales for 2 - 3 months.  it took that long to locate a VR6 CC (2010) because of VW Germany's shipping guidlines.  During that time I also (as opportunity arose) spoke with Daniel.  Between Lori and Daniel I was kept abreast of when a CC would be available.  Their follow-up was extra-ordinary.  As things turned out, my wife and I ended up working with Mario Espinosa, who took us on a test drive of the 2010 CC VR6.  Unfortunately, the CC that came in (again this is mother - VW in Germany determining how many cars are delivered where, incl. color) was white and we just couldn't get over the color thing.  I know, picky.  Anyway, Mario scoured the the US and found two VR6 CCs on the east coast, but they didn't fit the bill either.  Mario suggested that we order a 2011 CC so that we would get the car we wanted.  We reviewed the specs and it turned out that the 2011 had some things that we REALLY wanted and that clinched the deal.  We haven't bought one yet, be we have placed an order!

123,"May 07, 2010","Lori responded to an email inquiry within about 30 minutes; then talked to me on the phone when I called.  When I came in to the dealership, she introduced me to Daniel.  He showed me the car, took the road test with me (I did not know about the gate in the back, which I loved), and guided me through the process of buying the next day.  In every way he was helpful.  After two days I could not start the car for some strange reason.  I called at 7 in the morning and talked to the service people and was told how to start the car.  How can I not love Rod East!  I am telling all I know where I found my car.

124,"May 06, 2010","I bought my pre-owned 2003 Passat from Rod East VW, and have been satisfied with not only the car, but the Service staff as well. My Service Rep is Bryan Pyle, and shortly after my purchase, we had established a very good dealer/customer relationship. Bryan is friendly, knowledgeable, and always willing to accommodate my schedule. I particularly like the follow up phone calls and/or emails I receive from them to make sure the service was properly done, and more importantly that I was satisfied. 
I usually wait for my vehicle, and as I meander around the dealership, the various sales staff and employees I meet are very courteous and friendly, and never afraid to strike up a conversation.
I would highly recommend Rod East VW for service and sales.",5.0
125,"May 06, 2010","My husband and I test drove Mercedes, Lexus, BMW, Volvo, etc. Finally we looked at Volkswagon. Initally I didn't want another VW (because that's all I have ever had) and wanted to get something different. After meeting Mario and looking at all the great VW's we settled on a 2010 Jetta TDI and I LOVE IT! Mario was so helpful and friendly. He was not pushy and was going to do anything in his power to get me in the car I wanted. He is truly a genuine person! My husband loved my car and the service so much he went back that month and got a Jetta TDI Wagon. We look forward to our future relationship with Rod East and Mario.  Thank you for everything!",5.0

127,"May 06, 2010","This was my first new car purchase and with that, I did a lot of research.  I wasn't certain on the car I wanted when I started looking, but I knew what I wanted in a car.  I'm in the military and was actually on leave in San Antonio for a couple of weeks and while my main objective wasn't to purchase a car, I told myself that I'd look around and if I found a good deal I would go ahead and purchase one since I knew I would be purchasing one within the next couple of months.  I spent about 4 hours a day during the first week I was there going to various dealerships, looking at new and used cars.  By the end of the first week, I was exhausted from dealing with pushy salesmen and had almost given up on buying a car during this trip.  However, I had a friend that purchased a VW Passat from Rod East and she told me I should go check them out.  Trusting her judgment, I went ahead and gave them a shot.  As soon as I pulled up to Rod East, I started walking around the lot to see if anything caught my eye.  Within just a few minutes, I was approached by Danie Saenz and shortly into our conversation I could tell he was different than all the previous salesmen I had dealt with that week.  Daniel actually listened to me and figured out what I wanted, what I had to have in a car, what appealed to me and the great thing was he didn't try to push me into buying.  Daniel was extremely courteous and full of knowledge on VWs, which was good because I had lots of questions.  I looked a three different Passats and found one that I wanted, but I really wanted the upgraded 18"" rims and tires that were on another one.  Daniel went back and talked to the manager and they agreed that I could order the upgraded rims and come back on Monday to have them put on because they couldn't take them off another car, but Daniel had other plans.  While we were filling out all the paperwork, without me knowing Daniel was working behind the scene with the maintenance technicians and manager to have the rims and tires I wanted put on my car that day.  I ended up leaving the dealership with my brand new 2010 VW Passat just the way I wanted it and I couldn't beat the price.  After I decided on the car, I talked to my friend, Julia, that recommended I go there and come to find out, her salesman was also Daniel.  Additionally, the lady that was working in the finance office was extremely helpful and made sure I understood all the terms before leaving there.  And to top it off, they tinted my windows the following week and did an excellent job.  If anyone is in the market for a new car, I would definitely recommend they go to Rod East and ask for Daniel Saenz.  They won't be disappointed!  Thanks for making my first new car purchase a such a success!  Now I'm having a blast driving my new VW!

Sincerely,

128,"May 06, 2010","I first purchased a Touareg fron Clearlake VW in Houston.  After 1 month of ownership the TDI engine blewup and the car was towed to Rod East Volkswagen in San Antonio.  My dealings with VW of America were horrible thru this ordeal and my opinion of VW went to 0.  The folks at Clearlake were sympathetic but of no help.  It was the team at Rod East that supported me from day one.  They listened, consoled, offered thoughts and communicated my feelings to VWA.  I finally negotiated a settlement and bought a new CC from Paul Hernandez who led the team at Rod East.

I will continue to purchase from Rod East due to the knowledge and professionalism of the sales staff.  Mario has always gone above and beyond of what is expected of a sales person.  From scheduling my test drives, setting up a loaner vehicle when needed to delivering my purchased vehicle to my job site; I know I can count on him.  I never feel any pressure from him.  That goes a long way. His knowledge alone is one thing that keeps me going back. Rod East has continued to be successful due to the people that work there.

Daniel and his crew stood out especially because they understood what my husband had in mind as far as the expectations of the VW he was looking for and the overall impression we got from them as well as the rest of the ROD VW Dealership folks was fantastic! His patience and understanding went a long way especially during the test drives and when our 19 month old son kept running around and playing with the other vehicles! I do apologize for any inconvenience on our part. Also a special thanks to the accounting guy, I don't recall his name, but he really worked with us as far as payment plan and explained everything to the T and ensured we understood all the coverage we were receiving. Many thanks to everyone and all their hard work in making another VW customer go home happy! Keep doing what you do",5.0

I submitted a form online and Lori responded promptly.  She set me up with an outstanding sales person (Daniel).  The car that I wanted had already been sent to auction, but Lori got it back before it had gone up and I was able to purchase the car that I was wanting.  The sales process was extremely transparent and financing was a breeze.  All-in-all, it was the most pleasant car buying experience that I have ever had.  THANK YOU ROD EAST!!!

133,"May 06, 2010","Paul helped me get into an Eos.  About 5 months later I had a problem with the convertible top.  It was stuck in the middle; wouldn't go up or down.  It was after service hours and I was going in circles from receptionists to voice mail in the Service Depart. and back again.  I finally called Paul. He immediately got in Service Van and came to pick up not only me, but my two grandchildren, car seats, back packs, etc.  He took us back to the dealership where there was a car waiting for us.  He put all of our stuff in that car and we were off.  Now that is ""Service after the Sale""!!!  When it's time, I'll come back to Rod East and look for Paul.

138,"May 05, 2010","I went to Rod East, because I had a vheicle that was a lease from them with my ex-wife name on it. After talking to Daniel, we decided that buying a new car would be the benefical approach. I told him that I was interested in the Eos or the CC. After comparing the two cars, we decided to go with the Eos. Within seconds of that we went for a test drive. They onlt had 2 Eos's on the lot the car I endeed up getting was not the one I test drove. Instead I took the one that was parked inside the sales office. Then we talked about a price, I told him my budget and he was able to see if lease or loan was better. The loan was in my buget and without mile limits. Three days later I called him and told Daniel that I had another vehicle that we are upside down in. I told him that my ex-wife will own that vehicle so I wanted to get it out my name. He ran some numbers, gave us a trade quate without seeing the vehicle and was able to reduce her payment by $200. So we like the results and went in and she leased a VW Golf, with the help of Daniel.

My mom is thinking about getting an Eos, and I told her when she is ready to call Daniel Saenz, because he listen to you, is understanding of you situation and doesn't sell you a car that you don't need, but rather a car you want and will enjoy.",5.0

144,"May 04, 2010","We first met Paul Hernandez while waiting for repairs on our previous car at the dealer next door. We had been planning to purchase a new car for several months and had already visited several dealerships and driven three different makes of sedans. Paul greeted us warmly and we had his full and personal attention, even though we told him we were just passing time. We asked him to show us a new Passat station wagon because we had driven one as a rental in Germany.

Paul responded to every question we asked with factually correct information. Even when a particular feature of the Passat was not appealing to us, he did not try to talk us into anything or to convince us that we should accept something not on our list of priorities. He was just a tremendous source of information and knowledge with absolutely no hint of sales pressure. He earned our trust completely.

On the same front lot was a 2010 CC, fully equipped with 18"" wheels,navigation and premium sound. The car really got our attention because of the really high curb appeal even though we were not in the market for the expensive options. Our personal guide to Volkswagen, Paul, was equally knowledgeable about this car and willingly (even eagerly)gave us detailed information about the many standard features of the luxury package. We especially liked the leather trim, blue tooth phone capability, full power front seats,etc. etc. etc. We did not ask to test drive, but told Paul we hoped to return for that at a later date.

We did return on April 15 when we were able to get our previous car after repairs at the dealer next door. On that day Paul was not at the Rod East dealership because he was attending a training session. We were welcomed by Mario Espinosa who understood our desire to continue working with Paul, but he assured us that Rod East VW was a family of dedicated employees and all were motivated by friendly customer service. Mario toured us through the storage lot pointing out every CC in stock and answering our questions. Just as we were ready to test drive, Mario pointed out a silver luxury model that we could drive if we wished. We later learned that it was a demonstrator model being driven by Mr. Rod East as his personal vehicle. That test drive almost certainly clinched the deal for us, especially when we learned of the new car warranty but with a very generous discount. Mario started us off on the paperwork and Mr. East personally stopped in to tell us he was sure we would really enjoy this car.

The car is now ours and we are really enjoying it. We returned to San Antonio on April 23 when Paul had arranged for some minor details to be checked out. A courtesy shuttle was provided to our downtown hotel and we were picked up again that afternoon to claim our new CC. We met several other members of the Rod East family and all fully embodied the Rod East spirit of friendly and exceptional customer service.

We are back in Corpus Christi now, but Paul's latest good will effort was a follow-up phone call to let us know that we could call him with our questions at at any time or stop by for a visit the next time we are in San Antonio.

Thanks personally to Paul Hernandez with assistance from Mario Espinosa and all of the Rod East crew that we have already met.

We have purchased new VW's, used VW's, and even a used Honda from their used car selection. The service is number one, from the sales specialists to the guys in the service department, they have always treated us like family. 

On our most recent purchase, we traded in our VW van for a used Honda van. The transaction was without hassle. Paul Hernandez took us through each step with ease, he demo'd the used vehicle, and even put on the plates when we picked it up.
