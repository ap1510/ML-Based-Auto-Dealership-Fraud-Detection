0,"February 07, 2020","This may take a while but I want to be specific. I purchased my 2019 BMW X5 in October or 22019 from this dealership.  I purchased the vehichile on a Saturday afternoon.  While working out the particulars with the financing department I had declined all of the warranty service because I new I didn't need them, as well as being an educated consumer I knew they were a rip off.  I declined the offer severial times, but then I accepted only after the financial represenative said that it would cost about $3000 to have brake work done on the car, when it was time for them to be replaced.  Of course hearing this I got nervous and agreed to the plan.  Once I got home and did my research I decided that I didn't need the plan and decided I would cancel it.  First thing Monday morning, I phoned the dealership to have the warranty plan cancelled and they told me no problem I could come in and cancel it.  I drive over Monday after work and cancel the plan, only to be told that I couldn't cancel the plan.  This is where things really get outrageous! They tried to tell me that I can't cancel the plan through BMW that it was through a third party and once you sign the contract you can't cancel.  When went back and forth for a while, with them tell me "" give them some time to work this out"".  It is now February 2020 and Im still paying for a warrant plan that I don't need, was pressured into and lied to  about being able to cancel.  Would I buy from them again ""xxxx no"".  This dealership is not honest and definitely not looking out for their clients. Extremely disappointed!",1.8
1,"January 09, 2020","I recently leased a 2020 X5 from Ray, he was amazing and explained the vehicle in detail.
I then scheduled time with Daniel the BMW genius who explained how to adjust settings in the vehicle and set up my digital key! Daniel was awesome!!",4.0
2,"December 02, 2019",Went to dealership to buy demo X7. I was told when I was on my way that it wouldn’t be ready until Monday because the GM took it to a Xmas tree farm but would be put in a loaner. It sounded ok so I accepted and bought the car. On my way out the door (after I bought the car) the manager told me I may not get car until Tuesday now bc the GM has taken it to a “very wealthy” client. I was was flabbergasted. Why would he tell me such a thing and why would my car be delayed an extra day? When I asked on Monday if I was getting my car that day I was told yes between 4-5. Around 5:30 when I still hadn’t received the car I called the dealership and they said it will be several more hours. The same manager who told me about the “wealthy” client who had my car said that they kept it longer than they had anticipated and that’s why it was so late. He was extremely rude on the phone and implied that I was lying when I told him my salesperson had originally promised my car on Monday. It’s not the delay that bothered me...I was fine waiting another day. It was the utter lack I’d respect and dignity the way I was treated by this manager that I will NEVER do business here again. I went to Advantage BMW the next day and bought an almost identical car for a better price. They bent over backwards to be kind and make the whole process enjoyable.,1.0
3,"November 11, 2019","They say that BMW is the ultimate driving machine and in my experience BMW of Houston North is the ultimate buying experience: At every touch point from Nick the GM, Steve the GSM, Jorge our salesperson to Trevor the Finance guy...everyone was spectacular! Best car buying experience to date! Hats off to Team BMW of Houston North:",5.0
4,"November 08, 2019",This is the worst BMW dealership in Houston! I brought my BMW in for repairs with my insurance and they kept going back and forth with my insurance and did not want to work on my car! Added more frustration! Added more money for me to get my car removed! I would never buy a car from them and this place is not friendly!,1.0
5,"June 15, 2019","My experience was everything except pleasant. I purchased a 2018 540i last year from this location and today ended up stranded in the Houston heat waiting for the BMW Tow rescue team. I called the service dept. to give them a heads up of my unfortunate situation and was in route and would need a loaner. My elderly Father lives in Lake Charles, LA and became ill and unable to drive, but I promised him I would come visit him this FATHER’S DAY weekend because life is so short. I explained this to Tara the service manager on the phone.  She is extremely unprofessional, rude, and a terrible representation of BMW.  She approached me and said “we can’t give you a loaner because you will take it out of town” with an attitude. Didn’t properly greet me or offer any respect as my children watched.  I reminded her that this situation of my 2018 being inoperable was not planned, but refusing me a loaner was unacceptable. She pretty much laughed in my face!  I pray she doesn’t ever get treated the way she treated me. I did however get the loaner from someone else in the service center, which I’m thankful for.  BMW should do a better job of training “management” on how to handle a stressful situation. I see another complaint in the reviews regarding Tara’s unprofessionalism, which furthermore explains that BMW doesn’t have standard core values for their employees to follow. She chooses to belittle, condescend, and disrespect CUSTOMERS! Once I arrived home I called to speak to anyone higher up to explain what I needed, I was able to speak to Tony who was as helpful as he could’ve been. He attempted to reach out to voice my request to the Dealership Manager, but was unsuccessful. He was told to tell me the service manager denied my request. Of course she did, didn’t surprise me one bit. Not only do I not have my car, I have a loaner that’s parked in my driveway and had to compensate someone to drive me to my Dad’s home. I will never recommend anyone to this dealership especially if they ever have to speak to Tara. Everyone will know my experience! ",1.0
6,"April 25, 2019","I had an headlamp issue in which the warranty company I purchased my extended warranty through did not want to cover the cost.  Thanks to Jeremy Gold and the management staff they were able to review my warranty contract and get me a new headlight installed, provided me a loaner vehicle for the week, while keeping  me in the loop constantly as far as the time frame was concerned on my vehicle being completed. 
Thanks again guys and keep up the good work ",5.0

8,"June 26, 2018","My husband and I had a very good experience to purchase a new X5 from this dealership. Salesman not push you hard. All employees are professional, knowledgeable and friendly. I have to mention that the customer service is wonderful and very helpful. We definitely recommend this dealership to everyone.",5.0
9,"May 22, 2018","When you walk through the doors, you already feel a sense of calm come over you. You feel at home. Everyone acknowledges you with a smile or a hello. Khalid ( our Salesman ) was extremely professional and did everything in his power to find the best possible deal for me. Being my 1st BMW experience, he made me feel so comfortable where others may be nervous. I'd recommend this dealership to any and everyone based on hospitality alone. Thank you all!!!",5.0
10,"January 22, 2018","I recently purchased another BMW from BMW Houston North. I had the pleasure working with Steve Cook (sales director). Steve was/is the very best! Very informative. Steve explained all of the features that the M240 CV has in detail. The finance manager Kailey was so nice and made sure I was taken care of in finance. 

Radar and the service team are always smooth and efficient. Never have any issues or concerns when bringing my vehicle here. 

The dealership is always clean, and everyone is so prompt to assist you. 

Thanks again Steve & team for the premium experience! I will for sure return! ",5.0
11,"November 16, 2017","my husband took our car in to get the recalled airbag replaced, I called to confirm the part was in. bmw had also called confirming our appt. my husband gets there and 2-3 hours after Jeremy Gold is telling my husband there was an error and our part was never ordered in the first place. I don't understand how someone can confirm the part is in then when he gets there its not there, something doesn't add up.
my husband had to miss work to take the vehicle in.

this type of service is unacceptable and highly unprofessional.  I called and made a complaint to Steve Cook on Saturday November 11th (which is when the incident took place) and I'm still awaiting his call back. we also found out there are also 2 more recalls with the car so a total of 3.

Im so disappointed Im still awaiting a phone call back from Steve Cook, since Saturday I have called back twice and each time he can't take my call he supposedly would call me back. This is so RIDICULOUS this is very poor customer service. I would be contacting Bmw corporate.

Toyota's dealership has 100% better service. Im looking into purchasing another vehicle definitely having doubts about BMW.",1.0
12,"September 25, 2017","I have been a customer of BMW Houston North since 2010 and I have always been treated professionally and with care and attention. I recently lost my 535i to Hurricane Harvey. Traumatized and devastated at being forced to get another vehicle, the staff made the experience wonderful. I'm grateful to the team that help put me back in my new ride. Thanks to Steve, TJ and Miranda. ",5.0
13,"September 23, 2017","My Lexus ES was flooded during Hurricane Harvey. So Yes we are looking to purchase, not window shop. We asked the receptionist for a sales rep.....waiting....asked again....waiting and still no response. We then walked outside to look at a X5. A sales rep then showed up to tell us the car is not available and he is s currently working on a deal for this car. Then he proceeded to move the car! Still no salesperson for us. I guess we did not ""look"" like we wanted to buy. We plan to travel to Sewell BMW in Dallas for service we deserve. ",1.0
14,"August 09, 2017","Do not ever buy or lease a car from BMW of Houston North. My experience with them this week was horrible. I talked with the sales manager and we agreed on a price for a car and that I would be leasing it. Upon seeing the lease details, I noticed several mistakes:

They overcharged me on tax by $200. They were adamant it was correct, but they were proven wrong when they conceded and fixed the issue.

Further, I noticed that they were going to make me pay an additional $1,600 upfront as a cash “down payment” on the lease for no reason, thereby charging me more than the agreed upon price of the car.

Then, upon talking to their finance department, I noticed that they were going to charge me additional interest (money factor). BMW sets the rate at 3.62% (0.00151 x 2400) and they were going to charge me almost 1.00% more, despite having excellent credit. They wanted to make more money off the financing in addition to the sales price, and this was unacceptable to me.

Perhaps to someone who is un-sophisticated in finance, all of this garbage would work. However, with over 10 years in the investment industry and as a manager of my own hedge fund, this is insulting to me. I asked them one more time to address all of these issues and to send me a copy of the lease contract to review. As of right now, they have not responded, or are intentionally ignoring me.

The people that I worked with who were involved are: Barbara Angelopoulos (sales manager), Ed Steinberg (client advisor), Steven Cook (sales director), and Nick Butuc (general manager). In addition, there were two other finance department representatives whose names I unfortunately do not recall. Please avoid working with this group of people and the dealership in the future.

At best, the members of BMW of Houston North are incompetent, un-communicative, and passive-aggressive. At worst, they are liars with no moral or ethical compass and are unaccountable for their actions. They poorly reflect the values and reputation of the BMW brand.

17,"January 09, 2017","As a first time lease candidate, I had a lot of questions after my test drive experience. The experience went smoothly and all of my questions were answered.

The sales experience and test drive was great, thanks to Daniel Guevara. Daniel did a good job at going over the features of the models I looked at and explained all of the items included. When it came to negotiate a final price, Daniel took all of my comments effectively and made me a great offer. Daniel was polite, professional, and a joy to work with on this deal.

Even though the dealership was under construction, they did a great job to make customers and potential customers feel at ease. It was an overall great experience, far better than what I encountered at Momentum.",5.0

24,"February 09, 2016","This is only one of the many frustrating, blood boiling experience i have with BMW of North Houston. I took my X5 for an engine oil leak, the sérvice advisor informed me that they charge $180.00 for diagnostics. I have an extended warranty on my car, so they said that the warranty company will offset the diagnostic fee if a repair is needed. They arraganged a loaner car for me to use, so i left my x5 with them. I was promised that I will be given an update the same afternoon with regards to the status of my car. I waited for an update the whole day and nothing, not a phone call.  I have to be the one to call them so i can get an update, when they kept promising they will call me. I waited for a  week for the parts to arrive and repairs to be completed. So finally Eric Cabargo the service advisor, called me after a  week and said that the repair is complete but their technician needs to drive it for a day to make sure no leak will happen. They added 50 miles to my car for test drive? Really? 50 miles? Then i got a phone call a day after from Eric, the cooling fan broke apart on the way back to the dealership so another repair needs to be done. On top of that they said that there is something wrong with the left rear suspension. That they need to replace the left rear spring. And since the engine light came on, the oxygen sensor needs to be replace and that the extended warranty does not cover this  repair. So it took me another week and this time $1600.00 more to complete the repair. Since i have plans to talk to the warranty company, i gave a go signal for the repairs. After an additional 5 days i was able to finally get my car, after settling the due amount. As i was driving out of their drop off area, i noticed that the windshîed has a crack from one side of the glass to the other.  I immediately  brought it to their attention and they don't have an explanation for it.  
So now i am waiting for another week to have the windshield repaired!!!! To add insult to injury, this so called service advisor told me that he could have let me drove off their lot with a cracked windshiled but he did not. What the FREAKING xxxx?! Had i did not saw it i will drive off with a damaged windshield! He did not see it, not even the technician or their freaking driver! And i need to be thankful? I have other bad dealings with BMW of North Houston, the reason i keep taking it back to them is because my extended warranty is affiliated with them.  While you all still have a chance do not ever take your car here! Join the class action law suit to teach these company a lesson. ",1.0
25,"December 24, 2015","On August 20, 2015, I Janice Bonton and Dexter Cearsar took my BMW 530I to BMW OF HOUSTON NORTH at 17730-I45 North, Houston, Texas 77090 because while driving the car check engine light comes on.  
The Service Advisory was Facundo and Robert Chollett the Service Drive Manger.   The BMW 530I belong to myself Janice Bonton.   
On August 20, 2015, we verbalized that I wanted a diagnostic test done to find out what was wrong with the 2004 BMWi 530i.  I, Janice Bonton ask how much does a diagnostic test cost?  Mr. said “$180.00.” I asked “does it tell everything work with car”? Mr. Facundo “it will show all repairs needed.”   I left my vehicle at the BMW of North Houston North.   I said times two “Please call me before any repairs take place.  Mr. Facundo called Dexter Ceasar my fiancé.  Dexter told him to call me.   
Mr. Facundo call and Dexter “Good News” “It just your hose”   “It will cost about $300.00” Dexter told Facundo to call me Janice Bonton.  Facundo called and verbalized “the hose need to be replaced”. The technician also recommended your six spark plugs need changing.  I Janice Bonton told BMW staff to only repair the hose.  Dealership staff called back saying. After test driving the car the found another leak at the plastic coolant pipe from the rear or the thermostat to the heater hose.  I became very upset because I need my car and knew I was being scammed.  The dear ship staff should have test drove after fixing the hose.  I told them to go ahead and fix it, but I wanted all old parts back.  The technician/Facundo assured me they would give me all parts replaced, but they did not. They did not give me my hose that replaced. They only put plastic coolant pipe back. They kept my car from August 24, 2004 to September 2, 2015 they did not offer me a lender car. 
On September 2, 2015 arriving to pick up my car I told Mr.Robert Chollet I know they took advantage of me. I made it clear that I wanted all paper work in my name because it was my car. I also asked for about 30 other documents reference my car. It was the computer printout of service render. He refused to give me any and all documents that I signed.  I asked times two, but He only gave me three documents. I let him know “I paid over $1600 dollar and I want all documents” he would not even give me the computer printout from the diagnostic testing.  I was very upset and left.   Upon attempting to leave the dear ship, before getting out the drive way,   my window dropped. It was broken. I drove right back to the garage. I immediately spoke with the Mr. Robert Cohollett.  He said “technician is gone for the day”.  “You will have leave your car here.”  “I will have the technician look at it again in the morning.”    Upon returning Robert Chollett said “the left front window regulator failed and recommend replacing it.  I explain I know I was taken advantage of and was not going to give them another dime and left. 
I took car on one other occasion and let Robert Chollett know my car was doing the very same thing, but when the car is at a stopping motion. The car ran like a motor cycle.  I asked if they left something loose.  He said “we recommend you to change your spark plugs”. “They need replacing”.  I became distort again. Because I knew he was lying for fact and over charged me.  I told him I know I did not need no spark plugs and why didn’t they put all repaired parts in my car. Mr Robert CholletI said “You can see the hose is new.” I asked “where is the part” He couldn’t answer. I told him plan to take action because I paid over 2100 to change spark plugs September 23, 2014. He said “Why you didn’t tell me they are still under warranty”. I said “why would I tell you”. You are just scamming me for more money”. When I get some money I plan on taking action.  He refuse to give me documents.  I told him I never received the computer generated copy of the diagnostic. I told him my car is running worst with the same problem after paying over $1600 As of today I have not received any documents as requested nor have the dealership repaired my vehicle.
I have spoken with three attorneys’. I am currently looking for an attorney that will start a class action suit to repair vehicles, pay for rental car and lost wages from work.  I am trying to get as many customers that feel they have been scammed.  To all whom are interested; please text Janice Bonton at 28 18915859.  I would like for everyone to have copies of complaints that I can forward to a selected attorney.  I am going to file the BBB and the Texas Attorney General another and any other formal complaint agency regarding BMW of Houston North  service department.  I will also be writing a review regarding your service department and its scamming service and lack of attention to detail, fraud and shady repair work.

26,"December 05, 2015","Found a car at cars.com I was interested in. Cars.com showed that chat for BMW of Houston North was online. I contacted them, asked whether I could send someone in Houston to have the car checked out by an independent mechanic. This is a simple question and a simple request. The chat person did not know the answer but wanted my phone number and/or email to forward on to a rep. So chat is just a method of trolling to get information about possible buyers.

27,"November 13, 2015","Since BMW of Houston North has wasted enough of my time and money, I will simply post the email I sent the dealership manager Mr. Lozmack - I have yet to receive any response.

Mr. Lozmack,
As I continued to receive drivetrain malfunction errors after BMW of North Houston conducted the N63 ""Customer Care"" Service, I took my vehicle to another BMW dealership. I was both extremely frustrated and appalled with what I was told. Your service department did not reprogram my vehicle as per the procedure from SI B11 16 14 outlined in the N63 Engine Customer Care Package Evaluation released to all BMW service departments dated April 2015.
I have filed another formal complaint with BMW of North America regarding your service department and will be calling AutoNation customer service today. I will also be writing a review regarding your service department and its atrocious service and lack of attention to detail. As there is now a class action law suit against BMW regarding the N63 vehicles, I will also be contacting the Texas State Attorney Generals Office and will file a formal complaint for fraud and faulty repair work.
If you care to respond to this email; I would like an answer as to why my vehicle was not reprogrammed as required by BMW after N63 service was conducted on my vehicle. I would also like to know why when I brought my vehicle back the second time, this was not caught. Your service department had two opportunities to properly service my vehicle. At this point, I have no trust or faith in BMW of North Houston as I now believe the fuel pump did not need to be replaced. I believe you have incompetent technicians that obviously should not be working on customers vehicles. Your service department simply treated the symptoms and did not properly diagnosed the issue. 
The BMW dealership I took my vehicle to identified the reprogramming issue within three hours of having my vehicle. 
Once again, BMW of North Houston has wasted my time and money.",1.2
28,"July 20, 2015","WOW! What an easy process for buying a car! I reserved the car that I wanted, was contacted immediately by Mohammed Ali my salesman who was amazing, then was contacted by Cecilio Flores my finance manager, and we had all the necessary steps taken care of before I even arrived at the dealership! It took less than 1 hour to arrive, test drive, sign the papers, and shake the hand of both these gentlemen. Tell you friends! The revolution of auto buying has arrived!!",4.8
29,"June 27, 2015","Mohammed was a fantastic salesman.  Buying a car has never been such an easy and pleasant experience.  And my husband and I have bought a number of BMW's!  He was able the find the very car I wanted right away and was really up front and quick with getting the ""numbers""  right away.  He was very knowledgeable about the cars and really seemed to anticipate the questions I was going to ask .
And to top it all off, he delivered the car to my home and went over all the features.  What service.

I can say just as many great things about Ben Chiu, finance manager.  He was so helpful and pleasant. He was very patient in explaining all the financial details.  

I will certainly return to BMW North and, hopefully, work with Mohammed and Ben when I buy my next car.",5.0

32,"February 04, 2015","Advice: Please read terms and conditions before sign up.

i bought a Pre-owned 328i series BMW and a finance manager told me below . 

1. he would sell the car only if i take loan with them .
2. And also he told me that purchased extended warranty would be refund based on the miles/years driven .
3.in addition to that, he told install Lojack and insurance would go down by 10$ every month .

i took loan with high interest even with good credit score .later i shifted to other banks .
i came to know while selling the car that  extended warranty [ 4000 + 2000]  . here 2000 is non-refundable even the car sold after one month of purchase . 
non refundable /transferable on lo-jack . this was not told to me while purchase on Lojack",2.6
33,"October 21, 2014","Took my 2008 550i the car has 70k miles. When accelerate engine would hesitate. Would feel some small to medium shaking before it would take off. Was very annoying  so after the only mechanic i trust could not find the problem. I had no choice but to take it to a BMW dealer, yes not my favorite place apart from their outrageous rates.    
After four days they said it was the eccentric shaft (worn down) for that they had to remove valve cover and go in, Parts and labor $3,200 dealer also suggested replacing levers since we already had the engine open. I checked with my trusted mechanic he said yes that would be a good idea. So I gave dealer the go ahead. After completing the job they said they test drove my car to make sure the issue was resolved and that it was as good as new. I pick up the car and as soon as get on a major street I step on it and still felt some slight hesitation and shaking minor but still there. I would say it was 90% better. But After paying $3,200 you expect it to be perfect not almost perfect. Called the dealer to tell them but since I needed the car I would bring it back next week. Ok I bring the car back, the Forman and I go for a ride so he can experience first hand the hesitation and shaking. Three days later and after they supposedly did all kinds of test they said it's most likely the other eccentric shaft thats also worn out, Would not know for sure until they go in and check it out. But just doing that would be $900 for labor and a total of $2,800 parts and labor if it turns out to be the eccentric shaft.  I thought I would go get a second opinion so I said no thanks. Next day I pick up my car and after 10 minutes on the freeway car starts loosing power. I try to accelerate but its not responding at all. I make it to an exit pull over put the car on park and starts shaking like a junk car. I restart the car the shaking stops so I take off again. I soon notice that the car's original hesitation and shaking problem is back and WORSE than the original first time I brought the car for service. I take the car back to the dealer and told them I expect my car to be at least in the same condition I brought it in. After a few more days they call to say it's nothing they did wrong and just insisted that the car needs to have a second eccentric shaft replaced. 

Bottom line I brought them the car for a second time for the same original problem. Only now was less severe now I get it back in MUCH WORSE condition than when I brought it in the first time. Exact same problem goes in to their shop and comes out in worse condition just like that, just like magic. And they take no responsibility for it. Now I'm out $3,200 and my car in is in worse condition than when I first brought it in for service at BMW of Houston North thanks for nothing. 

This is the reason I avoided dealers and only go to them as a last option, but they keep on disappointing. I have never trusted dealers I had way to many bad experiences and obviously very expensive ones. Most people think just because its the dealer you can trust them ja!! they are the biggest rip off. I will say some or actually now day's  it feels more like most are thieves because they charge for parts they don't even replace, jobs they never even complete. I'm a business owner but its common cense that most big operations charge much more for their services and products.  Dealers have major overhead and charge customers double or as much as triple compared to smaller shops. That's why they have so called service advisors who's main job is not to give you good service it's to sell you as much as they can. Again use common cense it's mainly a commission earning job and on top of all this when they can't even fix your car right they take no responsibility they just wan't to keep on charging to take the time  to look into what they did wrong.

35,"May 28, 2013","Bought a re-certified same year car, I had a moldy smell the same day! Told my sales person about, took the car in for them to take a look at it, but all they did was to clean the AC system and tell me that it is ""normal"" to have this smell and that it happens in all models!
They blatantly lied to me when they said they have never heard of this issue before.

I did a 10 minute google search with ""bmw ac smell"", I came across hundreds of posts from people having the same problem, dating as far back as 2002 (11 years ago)! 
BMW even acknowledged on the owner's message board that they are aware of it and working on a fix back in 2006.

The dealership told me today that this issue is NOT covered under any BMW warranty-even though I purchased an additional 5 years from them.

They lie, don't take responsibility and do a very poor job overall. 

I would NEVER buy another BMW, especially not from the BMW of Houston North.

Since it was after hours on Friday night, the dealership called on Saturday morning asking if they could make an appointment for me to test drive the X5 I inquired about.  I did go by for the test drive and the salesman, Dieter Lehmann, greeted my wife and me.  He was very helpful, friendly and did not apply a ""hard sell"" approach.  Dieter was very knowledeable about the X5 and assisted us with the test drive.  The dealership was even willing to match a discount program my company has at a different BMW dealership in Houston.  I was very pleased with the price of the X5, but would have liked to get a little more in trade for my Audi Q5.  Although, the price and trade were acceptable.  When I made the decision to buy the X5, Phyllis was equally knowlegeable, courteous and helpful with the closing documentation.

45,"January 28, 2013","In July 2009, my husband and I were looking for a new BMW 328 hardtop.  We walked in, met with a salesman, told him what we were wanting to test drive, and he dismissed us as if we weren't serious buyers.  He found some keys to a car, gave them to us, and said &quot;just start clicking the &quot;lock&quot; and &quot;unlock&quot; button until you find it in the lot&quot;.  Really?  Ok.  So we go for our test drive, but decide not to buy at this dealer because of the lack of customer service.  

In August 2009, we find the car I want and drive to College Station to pick it up (excellent customer service, by the way). 1 month into owning my car, I notice my tire pressure is low in one tire.  The husband fills the tire up and about a month later it's low again.  Around this same time, I managed to get a nail in another tire.  So, I take my car in to Houston North get the nail out and since I bought the tire warranty when purchasing the vehicle, it was covered.  I had them look at the other tire that was leaking.  BMW said yes, there is a slow leak, but they will not cover it.  I told them that I had a warranty.  They gave me the number of the 3RD PARTY tire warranty company.  Guess what.. not covered.  BMW refused to cover it and the warranty people wouldn't either.  This is all over a period of 4 days. (Day 1, sat there for 6 hours and had me drive home with a patch while they ordered another tire for the one with the nail on it. Day 2, show up at opening for my new tires. They forgot to order them. I go back home.  Day 3, go back up in the morning and the tire didn't show up in the morning shipment like it was supposed to.  Waited 3 hours before they decided to give me a loaner.  Still wasn't ready by the end of day 3.  Day 4, go in and the 3rd party warranty company refused to pay for my tire with the leak and I'm out somewhere around $1,000 (had to pay for both tires and they had to reimburse me for the one with the nail).  Really excited to pay around $500 for a new tire after purchasing a brand new car). 

September 2011 - Went in for a routine oil change.  They said no longer than an hour. It took 45 minutes for my service advisor, Sandra, to even greet me. After waiting 2 hours for an oil change, I open the door to get into my car and the guy that had pulled my car around left grease on door from his hands and grease shoe marks on my floor mats (I have light cream interior). So, I went back inside to tell my service advisor and she had already left for the day! Really? You leave while you still have a customer?  I complained to the manager and thankfully got new floor mats.

2012 - went to Katy - Millennium West - Great, nice people

January 2013 - Need to get my battery checked because it was acting up.  Didn't want to wait 3 weeks for the Houston West dealership and Houston North had an opening that day.  I take in Friday afternoon, tell them what's going on and that I also need the oil topped off.  Marco walks up and says my service advisor Eric was busy, but he'd get my information so I can get on my way. My husband picked me up so I didn't have to take a loaner.  Saturday around 12:00 I had yet to hear from anyone.  I called 13 times and got a voicemail every time.  Finally after calling over and over, I got a hold of the receptionist.  I asked for Eric, my advisor.  &quot;Eric isn't in today&quot;.  Great.  So, I finally get a hold of Marco.  (2pm at this point and they close at 4pm).  He looks into my file and sees that a technician put my car on hold so it hasn't even been touched yet. I said I need a loaner because I have to get to work on Monday.  Monday I go to pick up my car and they forgot to top of my oil.  So, Marco, the service advisor, grabs a bottle of oil, unscrews the cap, and fills it up.  This seemed really strange to me, but I just wanted to get out of there.  Also, grease on the floor mats again.  That made me happy.  During all this, my car is parked in the middle of the &quot;garage&quot; and my hood is propped open and I'm standing outside my car and two managers walked by and didn't say hi or ask if I needed help with anything.  Customer service at its finest.

I located a car on line at BMW North, visited the dealer and looked at the BMW 650I. It appeared to be the vehicle I wanted, but I found some items that I did not want on the car and Lonnie got involved and in essence, allowed me to reverse the deal and then committed to finding me another vehicle. After searching his lot, and the inventory of every lot in Auto Nation, Lonnie and I located a vehicle and closed the deal. Although the vehicle was purchased at another dealer which resulted in another administrative issue, Lonnie once again made calls, emails and corrected this issue.

I purchased a 335i BMW from this location and upon buying the car my husband noticed multiple things wrong with the car. My husband is a mechanic and stated he would have never let this car pass. Anyhow, I purchased the car and the next day it went into the shop. It has now been 3 weeks BMW STILL has the car. My husband was told that the car was ready upon doing the walk thru he noticed there was something wrong. He stated it to the Service Manager who said it is fine. At that time another service personell walked up stating that he will not let the car leave in the condition it was in.. Baffles me how the SERVICE MANAGER was going to release the car but a service personell stated other wise.. I also, called to check the status one day and was told they do not know where my car is... This was after I left 5 voicemails and kept getting the answering service. No one at BMW really cares about the customer service - I work for a company that thrives on providing exceptional customer service. The interior of the car looked like someone took a rock and rubbed the door panels. The salesman who sold me the car was fired and never communicated with the service department what needed to be completed. It was my husband who called checking on the status and was told by the female service advisor that they did not know what needed to be completed... Are you serious? So you just let the car sit there? Apparently BMW has other customers they need to attend to. My personal expierence here again was horrid. I recommend the woodlands over north houston.

I was originally told that the vehicle was available for 1.9% financing and it later turned out to be a previously titled car therefore not eligible for the low financing. I was also not happy with the financing department and my credit card was not credited with the $3000. that I had given as a down payment for over 15 days when I received the bill and called the dealership. 
 
Resolution: I asked the sales manager, Mr. Soza to credit my card and pay the $30. interest for the 1/2 month. He immediately credited my account and sent me the receipt. He also clearly labeled the pre-owned cars with the 1.9% financing on those cars that qualify.

Currently I am waiting on an oil change that's going to take ""at least an hour"". The advisor didn't even know I was here waiting for her until 45 minutes after arriving. For a luxury car dealership, they lack customer service. You'd think for the amount of money you're paying for a vehicle that you would get treated better. I got treated better at Toyota! One time I was here, I knew the service was going to take longer, as I had spent the previous day waiting for 4 hours for a part they forgot to order, and they forgot to reserve my loaner car, so I had to wait an extra 2 hours just for that. Then, the part didn't come in on the morning shipment like it was supposed to, so I had to keep the rental car overnight and go back in the morning. That was 3 days of dealing with them. Absolutely ridiculous.

69,"August 04, 2011","Dropped my 2008 335i off at the dealership on 7/21/2011 due to an engine light.

Service Adviser was Allison. All went well at first. She was helpful, kind and good at communicating with me on a daily basis.

After some trouble diagnosing the problem (they replaced the engine valve cover). Hank the Service Manager takes over. He claims the oil servicing wasn't done on time ( first oil change was 2000miles overdue, and second one was overdue 3000 miles: Note the engine oil change recommendation is 15000 miles) the warranty for the engine is null. Of course Hank refuses to provide paperwork, refuses to provide and estimate. He claims the problem are the turbos wastegate actuator or the flapper valve, but that the oiling issue contributed to this failure.

Problem is the wastegate actuator is vacuum operated and not related to oil lubrication. Same for the flapper valve. After pointing this out, Hank admitted he didn't know what was actually wrong with the car, but that they would be willing to investigate further at my expense of course. No figures offered.

After some digging I saw that BMW offered the car for sale a month before I purchased it (from an independent dealer who bought it at auction) as a CPO car. When I took it in for servicing 2 months ago, I was offered the opportunity to purchase the extended warranty.

In other words, BMW was fine with offering extended warranties in March and again in May. I was even told that I could buy the warranty extension up until September of this year.

So, BMW acted in full faith of the warranty until they saw the cost go up.

72,"February 11, 2010","I am an extremely busy professional who travels internationally for business. I bought a Pre-Certified 330 CI to run around the hill country in while in Houston on business.  When looking at the car there was a clip broken on the front bumper and a scratch on the trunk.  The sales agent TJ Rennie said he would replace the bumper buff the scratch, replace the floor mats, and put new pipe cover.  This is why I did not drive the car out. I was told it would be ready the next day by noon.  I arrived and the car was not there so they gave me a loaner.  No issue to this point.  However when I finally did receive the car, the scratch had not been buffed out, the wiper fluid spray did not work, the car was filthy inside, and key remotes did not work.  After several back and forths through email, they did take care of the remotes and wiper spray issue at no cost.  However after driving the car for less than 6 weeks (which by the I only drive this car on average of once a week)the bumper fell back down and the engine light came on.  When I contacted Mr Rennie about bumper clip not being replaced...to let him know the body shop used had not repaired it, then the run around started full tilt.  Several back and forth emails then pushed to his boss who never returned emails or a phone message. I confirmed with the Austin dealership the clip was never replaced and there is a leak in the thermostat.  Austin BMW included the thermostat repair under the warranty.  Advantage and Momemtum BMW in Houston provide excellent service.  I gave them ample opportunity to correct the issue and now will have my atoorney try to recoup the expense of the repairs from them. DO NOT BUY OR HAVE YOUR CAR SERVICED BY HOUSTON BMW NORTH... it is not worth the trouble and you cannot believe them.",1.8
73,"January 05, 2010","Good mechanics, but really bad service advisors. Specially, Travis. Tried to get in contact with him about my car for a week  Left voice mails on his phone (he's never at his desk), never called me back to let me know what's wrong with my car. Picked up my car from them after 2 weeks. I had to drive to the dealership every other day to get an update on my car. This guy Travis should get fired. ",2.4
74,"September 27, 2009","I originally saw the 2007 Mini Cooper I wanted to purchase on E-Bay so I dealt mostly with the internet sales representative from BMW of North Houston.  I was pleased with the fact that I didn't get moved around to other sales people or ""closers.""  I made my bid on E-bay and followed up with her for the final sale.  Outstanding service from the moment we walked in the door. The test drive was a pleasant experience with no hard selling tactics - just an informative session while I drove basically as long as I desired.  The used Mini Cooper we purchased was delivered extremely clean and with a full tank of gas and to date, have had no problems with it.  Everything was explained in detail to us regarding the purchase and the automobile we purchased.  I thought the final price was very fair. Would come back again!",4.8

On top of that, he was with someone else when I arrived for out ""appointment"" and when I asked for a quote on a different car, he straight out told me that he can't offer me much because if I dont buy it then someone else would...I will never go back there...went straight to momentum and got the deal I wanted.",1.0
76,"October 04, 2007","Everytime I take my BMW X3 in for service, I am treated very poorly. For the love of god, why can't they just do their jobs correctly! I'm not even going to detail all the problems I have had with them so far, all I will say is that the employees of BMW Houston North are all incompetent jerks!! I don't blame the mechanics so much [occasionally it is their fault], but it's mainly the service writers or ""clients advisors"" that are the ones to blame. They treat me like crap, always screw something up on my car or order the wrong part, they take all day to do a simple project and the LIE to me when they screw up!! My husband is a mechanic, you can't lie to me about cars!! I'm never going back to BMW North again after tomorrow. I went today to get a simple interior cover replaced [after waiting 2 months for them to order the part and trying to contact them about it for a month and a half] and I sit there for an hour before they tell me they ordered the wrong part, and then I sit for another 30 minutes before I finally get my car!! My mechanic husband says nothing takes 30 minutes to do after they figured out they had the wrong part, but of course BMW had tons of excuses lined up! They have this AMAZING warranty, but their service is so awful that it's not even worth the warranty! I don't know if it's just me that they treat like crap, or if it's just my client advisor that's an idiot, but I'm never going back and I'm calling their corporate office to complain about my experiences! BMW North obviously does not value me, my opinion, or my business. I would not recommend them to ANYONE!",1.4
77,"June 23, 2007","Priced the z4 3.0si I wanted on the web and figured out what lease I wanted too.  Went in, met with the very friendly and helpful sales guy (no pressure, very unusual), booked the deal, got the car.  No hassles at all.  No sleazy attempts to add little hidden costs like I've had at every Toyota or American dealership in town.  No ""vehicle protection policy"" that is just a bottle of goop in the glove compartment or a number on the glass for $500!  No attempt to change the rates at the last minute... nothing... just a perfect sales experience.  They actually expedited the car for me since I would be leaving town for a while so my wife could have it before we left.  They arranged a great job on the tinting for us (after the sale, at which time they also went over all the BMW Assist with my wife).  This is the best buying experience we have ever had.  If the car itself is as good, we will be hooked on BMW and this dealership.  If you are buying new and want a good experience without all the tricks and hassles, this is the right place.  Note I also tried Advantage and Momentum.  They were very sleazy and only wanted to sell what they had on the lot.  Once they realized I wanted a car that they did not have in stock, they were quite rude... although I still get their spam e-mail all the time... argh!  Give Lee a call, he is a great guy!",4.6
78,"February 01, 2005","I am 25 and I bought my first CAR, Nissan Altima, from BMW of Houston North. I saw the deal on the internet through automation.com. I came from college station TX to the BMW dealership at Houston with great hopes. But I am sorry to say that I am extremely disappointed by the services given to me. Here are the reasons for my disappointment.1. I did not expect a dealership likes of BMW not to get the battery of the car changed. The moment I took it out from the dealership after I bought it (9 pm at night), the car stopped working because the battery was old and it didn’t pick up the load. So till 12 pm at night, I was stuck on the road trying to get the car fixed (bought 2 hours back). Note(Thanks to Mr. Taber the sales representative for fixing it) but he should have been responsible enough not to give me the car from the dealership at the first place, specially after knowing that I came from a place 100 miles from Houston and was driving back the same night.2. Even though the service department recommended, that the serpentine belt of the car be changed (it costs 14$ and service charge is 70$ all over US), and the wheels rotated on the CAR (service worth 30$ all over US). This service was not done on the car. I got it fixed it after I bought it.3. The manager of USED CAR never ever answers his phone. He doesn’t even have the courtesy of returning a message left by a customer. He is extremely arrogant; this is no way to treat your customer. I understand I bought a used car and will have some wear and tear, but such small works should not have been denied. That was extremely cheap.4. Even before I bought the car, the manager of used car had promised to me that I will get a detailed description of the work done on the car the next morning. Off-course after I bought the car I got that 3 and a ½ weeks latter. I kept calling no one had the courtesy not even Mr. Taber to keep me updated on why there was a delay and Mr.  For sure this might be my first car, but not my Last, there are miles to go....But thanks to the COLD attitude of the management and some cheap decisions again by the management I am not coming back ever. Also my recommendations to my Family and Friends will be negative. A note to all the managers there...Please sit down and think you spend so much on marketing, and ads. and you forgot your basics....I am 25 right now I am a student, but I m coming to Houston this May, joining Toshiba International Corporation. You guys are an expert in case studies, I don’t have to do it for you. I will never ever be able to forget my first experience of buying a car. This is my humble request, please in the future don’t do such mistreatment to a customer. ",1.0
79,"June 29, 2004","Mr Garcia briefly talked to me and my wife on Saturday, June 26. This being our first time actually initiating contact with your dealership made us want to ask as many questions as possible considering all financial options. Mr. Garcia proclaimed himself the financial ""guru"" and proceeded to give us a few estimates according to financial information we provided him. His estimates were shockingly high and this prompted my wife and I to say to Mr. Garcia that we would have to consider other options as far as car models were concerned. Mr. Garcia then extended his business card to us, and then retracted stating that he believed it was a waste of his time and that he would probably not see us again. This made me and my wife very uncomfortable, as Mr. Garcia was implying that we were not of BMW ownership ""caliber"". Big Mistake!!We instead drove straight to Advantage BMW Midtown where we closed on a 2004 325I and were treated like the customers we so eagerly wanted to become. So much for profiling your customers Mr. Garcia!!",1.0
80,"June 07, 2004","I have a mixed review on my expierience of bringing in my car for service for the first time.  I had made an appointment online and after a few minutes a lady immeidiately called me to verify my time and had reserved a loaner for me. I was very impressed. I brought my car in on Wed May 26. It took no longer than 10 minutes to drop off my car and pick up a loaner. The man at the Enterprise counter took very good care of me. He let me choose which loaner I wanted (I chose the Z4 3.0) I had forgotten my insurance so my dad had to fax it over. He made a copy for the records and made an extra copy for me to have. I thought that was a kind gesture (I just wish I had remembered his name) Well day after day I await the phone call telling me that my car is ready.  I waited awhile and finally called them today, June 7 asking if my car was ready. It turns out that it had been ready for awhile.  Hours later, i get another phone call asking me to see if anyone had called telling my car was ready. It turns out that my service advisor (David Eagan) had quit and the finally searched through his files and found that my car was ready.  I picked it up today and he did a great job. my car felt brand new and they even washed it.  The only problem I have was the lenghty waiting period but that gave me time to expierience the Z4 longer and now I am thinking about getting one for my next car. All in all, great service on behalf of Houston North. I have read reviews on Momentum and I feel lucky that I have chose Houston North over any other!",5.0
81,"June 07, 2004",My dad had purchased a car for me and I was along his side the whole time. I just feel that Ed needs some recognition for his outstanding help and knowledge.  I had my heart set on a Silver Gray coupe but my dad forgot to make a deposit when we went on vacation. When my dad got back to purchase a car before school started that particular car was already sold. Ed tried everything he could and searched for cars out of state. Eventually he found a car that was similar and my dad made a purchase. Ed is a great guy =),5.0
