1,"March 22, 2018","Iv looked at several used cars here. While I don't expect them to be perfect. Everything iv looked at was either way over priced or trashed. One car I looked at was clearly smoked in. The sales tried telling me it wasn't, I told him there were several burn marks inside. He said they would clean right off. I told you can clean off burned interior and melted plastic. He said he mist if missed those. Bottom line these are the shady, lying car salesman everyone warns you about. Also after I gave them to go ahead to run my credit, they proceeded to hit it about 8 times causing my score to drop significantly. Beware.",1.6

3,"June 01, 2017",My parents Kia broke down on the way to Amarillo so I towed it to the dealership (where I thought would be the fastest and  most efficient place to go). Boy was I wrong! We had a very small window of time to get this fixed bc we were in town for my sons graduation. I made the appointment online the night before I brought it in at 8:30am and explained that this really needed to be done. They didn't even look at it till 2pm that day where they gave me the price and I told them to fix it needless to say it's 7 days later and they are driving home with the check engine light still on! I'm so mad!,1.0
