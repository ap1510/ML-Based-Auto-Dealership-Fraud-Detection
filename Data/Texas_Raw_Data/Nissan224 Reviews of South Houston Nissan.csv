3,"February 27, 2020","Be aware buyers, This Dealer have the most rude sales person.
I visited the South Houston Nissan on 02/25/2020, Waleed AlHamra was rude when I met him !
We couldnâ€™t agree on a price, and The saleswoman who tried to sell me a car called me two days later 02/27/2020 to follow up with me, I told her that I just bought a Nissan Kicks from another dealer, she got upset and hanged up the phone on me !!!!!!
I should have left the dealer the minute I met Waleed AlHamra.
I will definitely share and write this review on all the web page has the name of South Houston Nissan.

When we got there, that price wasnâ€™t available.....classic bait and switch and very predatory.  Go somewhere else, for your own good.  ",1.0

They act like they work some kind of magic to get you a car and if you try to tell them you donâ€™t want it they will keep submitting your info to different banks making your credit drop and their GM has also told his finance ppl to make sure you donâ€™t get another deal anywhere else if you donâ€™t work with him. BBB for sure.,1.2

The gentleman said the part would be in the next day and I could come at any time.  He was scheduled to be off but he assured me there would be capable service technician to assure.  I went to the service center the next day.  The jerk at the counter was rude, unhelpful and dismissive toward me.  The part wasnâ€™t available and my time schedule was short as I was there for MD Anderson appointments.  I will find another service center that treats customers like worthwhile people!",1.0

12,"October 17, 2019","If I could put a zero I would. I was told that they would work out a deal for getting my first car (Sentra) traded in, which they didn't. What happened instead, is they took my ""trade-in"" ,never notified that lender that my car had been left and allowed payments to continue to be drafted from my bank account. In addition, I never received documents  saying that the Sentra had been left in their possession.Meanwhile they sold me a second car, 8,000 over the blue book value. When I went to see why I was still being charged for the first car, the Lead supervisor, Mario< told me to get a lawyer. He never tried to correct the problem nor does he know where the first car is. In fact, he tried to say that I never left it at all. I contacted Corporate, Mario called me and said he would give me documents saying that they had my car, but when I went to pick them up , he told me he would not speak to me except through my lawyer. I never got the documents. So now, payments are being deducted for the first car, which they won't tell me where it is, i'm being charged for the second car and I have no proof of them taking possession of the Sentra . In fact, the Finance salesman, Ollie told me to just say the car had been repossessed. Why would I do that when I've made on time payments since taking possession of the Sentra? What a scam! Beware people cause this could be  you.",1.0
13,"October 14, 2019","I wanted to give this dealership a second chance.  I brought my truck in to check the recall, and to have the jet engine sound fixed, and, the whistling Fuel filler looked at.  The truck was in and out in less than an hour.  That seemed great, perhaps they are doing better.  However, I was told that they needed me to go with the mechanic (Toby) to show him the problem.  Not a problem.  I stepped over to the side of the building where my truck was.  Spoke with Toby.  Explained the issue, and that I have only had this problem for a short time.  In fact, when I purchased this truck, it was 99 degrees in Houston, and of course, I had the AC on, but, not Jet engine sound.  He told me that there are no codes stored, and that it was working as designed.  If that were true, why did it not act this way until 2 weeks ago?  And, the fuel tank noise was explained that they have not heard of it, and would have to call Nissan next week.  Hmm, I think I will be calling Nissan this week to see if we can find someone to fix it.  Very dissapointed.  I traded a 2003 Frontier for this?  It is a shame that, to me, this dealership seeps to push off customers.  I have been driving Nissan since 1994.  This will be my last one!  One positive note, this time, at the front counter, I delt with a gentleman named Frank,  He was courteous, and listens.  Much better experience with him than other service writers here.  I will NOT be back to the dealership!  They could not even fix my 2017 Nissan Rogue Sport (Issues posted previously.)",3.0

15,"September 20, 2019","We purchased our 2017 Nissan Rogue Sport SL in Feb. 2017 from McDavid Nissan (South Houston Nissan Now).  Overall, we have always been treated with respect, and the service center was always helpful.  Fast forward to Sept, 2019.  My wife had an accident (Someone hit her from the rear).  Body shop repaired the problem, and then the car was sent over to service to get some other issues taken care of.  The car was there for 3 days, and NOTHING was done.  My wife spoke with David Alcanar, and mentioned we would come in and get the car on Friday.  He told her ""you need to bring the rent car back immediately, or we will file charges against you for theft.  It is OUR vehicle.""  That was a funny statement, as it was rented at Enterprise, not the dealership.  Anyway, we needed the car for the weekend, so I picked it up, with a promise to return it on Monday, for any issue with the radio still having power after you open the car door, which it did not do until 2 weeks before we brought it in.   We brought it back on Monday, and spoke with David Alcantar, the service advisor.  He spoke with his manager, who authorized a rental again from Enterprise.  On Wed. afternoon, David called me, and told me again, that the car was working as designed, and that they had verified that it works the same as another 2017 Nissan Rogue.  I tried to explain to him that this problem has only happened for the last 2 weeks, and, that I have verified how it is supposed to work correctly on 2 other 2017 Nissan Rogue Sports here in the office, as well as my 2017 Nissan Titan.  His voice suddenly got louder, almost to the point of yelling, telling me that it is the way these work, and, then, TOLD me that I needed to bring ""HIS"" rent car back.  Again, the second rent car came from Enterprise, not the dealer.  So, I am working to open a case with Consumer affairs on the issue, and intend to let the service manager know about how I was treated.  You should NEVER treat customers as second class citizens, and remember, we do buy cars, and if we have a bad experience, our business can and will go elsewhere.  Please do not use South Houston Nissan.  It is not nearly as good as the old McDavid Nissan was.  Probably the last time I will return to this dealership.",1.2
16,"September 02, 2019","We went on Friday because we were told by Desriee  That we could definitely be helped even though we were up front about our credit score and situation. We told her we were going to wait until February when we had money she swore up-and-down that something can be done so we went and our time  Got wasted. I was told that I would get a call when there was an update that did not happen then I was told we would need a CO signer I made it clear up front that we were not going to do that they said it could be done without a CO signer.  One thing I do not like is empty promises and wasted time. And the kicker I still haven't received a call from them about the update on the deal. They need to admit they couldn't do it I'm not waiting anymore it doesn't take a bank that long to say yes or no we just know not to come here when we're ready. Buy the way I'm gonna get that 2020 Nissan versa sv, In February . I really really want that car. I'm gonna drop alot of money to get that car not I wont do it here. ",1.4

21,"June 07, 2019","Purchase a used 2018 Pathfinder in October. Online ad stated vehicle had tow package. Arrived at dealership to find no tow package. Sales Mgr refused to negotiate on price, but offers to install same. On day of pick up was told  it would take ~2 hrs to install (ready around 11:00). Hitch was not installed until 7:00 pm.  Have had ongoing electrical issues with vehicle since purchase (heated steering wheel did not work, tow mode did not work), window tinting applied at David McDavid has huge wrinkle on driver side window). Central Houston Nissan said David McDavid should correct the wrinkled window tinting. David McDavid refused. The Servuce Mgr at Central Houston called David McDavid to try and help. Even he could not persuade this shoddy Dealer to make good on their work. Last week I took my SUV to Mater Hitch in Bellaire to have new wiring harness installed on my horse trailer to match plug on car + wireless brakes added.  Spent 4 hours today at Master Hitch when I should have been able to drive off immediately because David McDavid installation of th hitch was WRONG and the computer had never been re-programmed to let the car ""know"" the tow pkg had been installed. Called the local Nissan Dealer--Central Houston Nissan to see if they could help. Was told I would have to take car back to David McDavid since they had done the installation. Called David McDavid and the Service Dept told me they could not help me until I spoke to a  Sakes Rep as they could not access the information about the hitch in stallion from their computer system. REALLY??? Placed me on hold. 10 minutes of continuous hold later I hung up. 
Short story-DO NOT use this dealership. Their work is subpar and an embarrassment to the car industry. The service is shoddy, incomplete, and they do NOT stand behind their work. Do yourself a favor and spend your hard earned money elsewhere.",1.0
22,"May 07, 2019","Took my 2018 Altima in because the car stopped communicating with my smart keys, both of them would not start my car. It left me stranded last week but after unhooking the battery I was able to get the car to start. Thought it might have just been a glitch but over the last week has done it 4 more times. I take it in and speak to a lady in service dept at Mcdavid Nissan and after explaining what happened she asked one of the other service advisors if it was covered under Nissans 3 year 36k warranty. He says NO, I will have to pay 200 dollars for them to reprogram my car to communicate with its Smart Keys. They did not say let us talk to Nissan or let us look at it and see what might be wrong. I think a car that leaves you stranded because something is wrong with the computer and it is still under warranty should be handled a little differently .",1.0

I told Ramon on Sunday night, Monday and Tuesday that I wanted to buy the Rogue for the listed price of $22995. I talked to your finance manager on Tuesday and she said I could hold the car with a deposit. Ramon said I couldn't and then the service department changes the oil and the manager makes the Rogue a ""Certified"" vehicle and raises the price by $2000!

27,"December 17, 2018","Absolutely horrible service from all aspects of Nissan.  
Summary: 
Issue was reported to Nissan Consumer Affairs (CA) and I was told that my car was still under warranty. 

My vehicle was at McDavid Nissan for 5 days before it was looked at despite having an Appointment. 

Due to the delay in inspecting the vehicle the warranty had exceeded the 3 year warranty window.  

CA changed told me I was out of luck but would examine my case for out of warranty assistance. This would take an additional 3-5 business days 

12+ calls were left unanswered and messages left un-returned about the status of my vehicle.  

3 messages left with the service manager were un-returned. 

No loaner car was provided and I was told I would need to pay to rent a vehicle.  

The 6 hour job took 9 days to complete. 

Full Story: 

I purchased a 2016 370z Nismo In November 2015. My vehicle developed a water leak in heavy rain on the driver side door. This looks to be a common problem with these vehicles. My vehicle had 33,000 miles and I was told at another dealership that the warranty only covered 32,000 miles. I reported the issue to CA on a survey and was called by a representative. They told me that my vehicle was still under warranty and should take it in. I made an appointment as soon as I could and dropped the vehicle off on a Monday at 4 PM. I was told that no loaner would be provided and that I needed to pay for a rental. This is ridiculous and seems to be the common policy for all Nissan dealers. By Wednesday they had still not inspected the car. Finally, on Friday they called to let me know that they had found the issue and that I would need to approve the charges. I called to find out what the charges were since it was under warranty, but my service rep was out of the office and no one else could help me. On Saturday I was finally able to reach my service rep who informed me that my warranty had expired 3 days prior to me bringing it in and the work would cost $2,000. I called back to CA to figure out why I was told the work would be covered. When I called they told me I was screwed. Even though I had reported the issue inside the 3-year window, and the exact issue I described was found upon inspection, since the service department took so long to inspect the vehicle the warranty had expired. On the following Monday they called me back in and said they would look at my case for out of warranty assistance in 3-5 days but there were no guarantees. I told the dealer to order the parts so that the work could progress while I was waiting. The parts took twice as long to arrive over what I was told. When I called to find out about the status of the parts my calls were ignored and when I left messages no one would return my calls. I called over 8 times on Tuesday to get a status update and all the calls were ignored. I left 2 different messages with the service manager and these calls were never returned. I was again denied a loaner car. During the entire process my issues were treated as my problem and Nissan was of no help. On Wednesday I called again to get a status update, after 3 ignored call and another ignored message to the service manager, I was told that they were still waiting on approval from CA. CA told me they had marked the case urgent, but it could take another day or two. I told them the work would be complete and that I was going to pick up the car because I needed transportation. CA said that if I did that, the case would have to be reevaluated for reimbursement and could change their decision. I told them that this was absurd, and they said they couldn't do anything about it. Later that day CA called to let me know they had finally reached a decision to cover the repairs. I went to the dealership to pick up the car, but it wasn't ready even though I was told it would be. When the car was finally done, they didn't pull it up, they just gave me the keys and told me to go find my vehicle. 

I will never buy another Nissan and neither will my friends or coworkers.",1.0

I said no. Then a couple hours later got a text asking when i was coming in? I replied I was not putting money down since I was already told I was approved before. Then the finance mgr called and said he got it down to 0 down but at 700 a month for the truck. I asked what truck? I haven't picked out a truck. He said the bank picked it out for you.. Lmao... My fiance and i talked it over for a couple hours and called back and asked if the truck was still available? We wanted to come see what it looked like and would see if we could get the payments lower. When we got there (an hour later) they said the truck was sold. Lmao. Unreal. Told them they were the worst sales team i had ever dealt with. And they said they would call me Monday cause the banks were closed. We left and went to another dealership at 8 pm.

46,"July 11, 2018","I dealt entirely over the phone with the sales manager only.  The price and trade were negotiated separately and we're agreed to verbally and via email.  When I went in to sign paperwork, the trade price was correct, the new car price was correct, but a line item showed about $850 worth of dealer add on like floor mats and wheel locks which were never previously mentioned.  The sales manager would neither remove them or include them in the negotiated price. I walked.  This is an old school trick to increase profits. The was my first experience with $199 lug nuts. Undercoating was popular back in the day.
AVOID this dealership.  I went to Keating the next morning and drove home the identical car with the LG nuts, mats, other add on  and an addition GPS system for $1850 less than McDavid.

I purchased the vehicle on May 25th and financed thru my local credit union.  I left the dealer with a copy of the instructions from the bank on what all they needed and how it needed to be filled out in order for them to be paid.  The dealer did not return the corrected paperwork until May 31st.   Starting on the 31st I started receiving texts from the salesman, calls from the salesman and a call from the sales mgr harassing me because they had not yet received their payment. They took 6 days to turn in the right paperwork but expected me & my bank to have the loan closed immediately.  Because of this experience I cannot recommend that anyone use this dealership.

I am INCENSED.  If I make an appointment for a certain day and time, I expect that, within reason, the person I meet is setting aside a block of time specifically to do business with me.

I inspected the car at night and it looked good.  We loved the car but the next day I checked underneath the car....I found rust ALL over the car and it was obvious the car had sat in water.  We came back immediately and were laughed at by MARIO.  They LIED to us and took advantage of a flood victim whose car was flooded due to us trying to help others.

50,"July 03, 2017","We bought a 2017 Altima SL on June 17th of this year. Had to sign 3 contracts before they got the info right. Then we get called back to sign another one because they messed up the numbers on their end. They listed all the rebates under the the dealer section instead of splitting it between manufacturer and dealer. So for us to go back and sign again due to their error we asked for something for the car as compensation for our time. They refused so we refused to sign. Here we are 2 weeks and 2 days later and I noticed 3 perfect circular scratches on the passenger rear wheel which in no way we could have done. So we take it back to the dealer and they refuse to replace it saying it's our problem now and they'll do nothing because we refused to sign the new contract and they lost money on our deal. This was told to us by one of the sales managers, Waleed Alhamra. That's not something you tell a customer much less a repeat customer. This is our second car from them in 4 years, needless to say we are not happy at all and wish we could just give the car back and take our old one back and forget the whole thing. We will be contacting Nissan and whoever else we can to get this taken care of. Customer satisfaction should be priority in my opinion. Happy customers who are satisfied will return if they feel like were treated fairly. ",1.6

When I picked up my car on Monday around 5:45 p.m I asked the one person there about the report. He said he didn't know, that is all the information that he left and that I would have to speak to Mike. For 129.00, I will be up there this weekend, If there is not a report made available to me, I will take my refund. In what business is ignoring the customer allowed? I'm in disbelief at this lack of customer service.",1.0

I called them two times myself and every time the answer was, ""We will contact you right back"", never heard anything back. I went in after a week of no response and check on my vehicle. The paperwork was seating in a huge pile. The diagnosis was an engine mis-fire, and they don't know what's wrong, saying that they had to dismantle the entire engine and I may need a new motor, which would cost me couple thousands of dollars. (I was thinking either a bad spark plug or a bad sensor) I check out my vehicle and took it to a private mechanic. Their diagnosis was a faulty spark plug and after a general tune up for a low price of $284.00 , the vehicle was rolling smoothly again like a brand new vehicle. The price for a general tune up at the dealership was a thousand dollars plus. The dealership was trying to make a huge profit at my expense, for a minor spark plug which I knew that they knew was bad. Worse dealership experience ever.

Just heads up people. Do NOT purchase a vehicle from this place. Me and my husband negotiated a vehicle purchase for my father-n-law and stated clearly ""DRIVE OUT PRICE"" (meaning tax title and license/TOTAL) which was put in writing by their salesman Justin Morris. The drive out price was negotiated to 28,734.00. Due to the time being near closing, my father in law was instructed to come back the following business day and complete the transaction. Imagine that, I took a look at his purchase contract and they CHANGED/SNAKED the price of the truck to 30,899.69 on the final sales contract as me and my husband had to work and could not be there to see the deal through.

We got there and ask for her bit a gentlemen came out to us and said Ashley just makes phone calls, not a salesperson. Well then how did she know about my finance approval. He didn't even act like he was interested in making a sale. Then we go to look at the truck and it was noticeable that it had a lot of body work done to the bed. And it was a very bad job of repairing it. What I was upset about is the salesperson was not friendly at all and on the website it never said anything about it being in a wreck or we would not have driven an hour and a half to go up there for a $35,000.00 truck that had been in a really bad wreck.

Finance officer did his job, can't fault him for that, but it took forever to get the deal we agreed on and we had to walk out after ridiculous APR rates when we knew we could get better. Manager called and offered us a very low rate, so we came back and got the car. Minor hiccups since, such as maintenance issues that should have been checked before I drove off the lot, but Kene and service rep (Jessikah?) took care of me quickly when I came back, so I left happy.

Last week I received a phone call from ""Nisha"" or ""Misha"" whatever and was told that I was approved for $19000 of course I was happy to hear that due to bad credit scores and so on.  I decided that I would go down to the dealership on Thursday evening, with my daughter.  I knew that this may be difficult but I went in with a good attitude.  When I got there, I was told that I would need to fill out a credit application.  I told the lady that I had already done that and I would not do it again.  She said they just needed to verify my information, I agreed to fill it out.  A couple of the sales reps were standing at the front door like vultures, eating fried chicken and using horrible language in front of my 9 year old daughter.  I asked him to stop and he said he did not use any ugly language.  I told him I WATCHED and HEARD him.  Once I was done, I waited and a salesman came out and stated that he was going to show me his inventory.  I asked where the lady that I was working with was and he said ""she's at her desk, I'm showing you my inventory.""  Needless to say, they flat out LIED about everything they said.  I was not approved for that amount.  The salesman said I needed a cosigner, I called and ask my brother to co-sign.  They ran his credit not once but twice!!!  That evening I called and ask for a manager, I was given a ""sales director"" I explained to him the problem.  I told him that I was not concerned with getting a new car, it was not that I was unhappy about not being financed for $19000, it was that I was flat out lied to.  He said he would be calling me back, he has yet to call me back.  I left a bad review on Facebook and Edmunds and the ""General Manager"" Tim apologized to me on Facebook and ask that I call him.  Fine.  I called and was not even given the voicemail to Tim but to Josh.  I had to hang up and call back.  I finally left a message for Tim.  He did call me back.  I told him about my experience, that was at 10:53AM CST.  I called him again at 2:00PM CST, left yet another message, I'm waiting on his call back.  Did I mention I'm still waiting on the ""sales director"" to return my call from last Thursday?

67,"October 22, 2015","1.	On June 20th of this year, I took in my 2004 Nissan Armada for service due to an issue with the A/C. I had explained to the Service Advisor during scheduling that the A/C had all of a sudden started blowing hot air. I explained that a mechanic had checked the pressure and advised that there was no leak found so that was ruled out. I also told the Advisor that Iâ€™d been hearing a knocking noise when I switched the A/C mode (i.e. from A/C to defrost). I was told theyâ€™d check it out and let me know what the problem was.
2.	The week of June 22nd, I get a call from the Advisor stating that the issue had been diagnosed and that the total to fix it would be $669.81. I gave the ok to proceed as I was told this would correct the problem. Later that week, I go to pick up the car after getting a call that is was ready. Advisor goes to the back to bring the car to me and 15 minutes later, he returns saying that the A/C was not working as it had earlier and that theyâ€™d need more time to re-assess the problem. I leave without the car.
3.	The week of June 29th, I get a call saying that the issue had now been fixed (this was the second time). I asked what the problem was and was told that the temperature controls were not working and had to be replaced. That would cost an additional $562.27, bringing the total to $1227.42. Keep in mind that I was not made aware of the control replacement after it was already installed. I was not happy but agreed to pay the total as I needed the car and wanted to get this over with. I pick up the car and after driving it less than 5 miles, I called the Advisor and told him that the A/C was doing the same thing, blowing hot air. I was told to take it in again. 
4.	I get a call again on July 4th saying that the car was fixed (this was the third time). When I go in on July 7th to pick it up, I again ask what the problem was this time and was told it was a sensor on one of the lines and that there would be no charge (which I wasnâ€™t expecting). I pick up the car and again, after driving it off, find out that the A/C was still not working. This was now getting very frustrating. I call Advisor again, he tells me to take it in again. I talked to the Service Manager after this and told him about the situation. He assures me that the problem will be fixed. 
5.	 Between July 10th and August 13th, I take the car in again three more times and every time it is the same thing, I get a call saying the A/C is fixed, I pick-up the car, I find out the A/C is still doing the same thing. On July 22nd, I spoke to the Service Director about all of the issues and he said he would look into this and call me back. He did not bother to call back, not even as a courtesy.  
6.	My wife picked up the car on August 18th and it seemed to be working fine. One week later, it started doing the same thing. After more than three months, after multiple trips to the shop, and after paying over $1200, Iâ€™m still stuck with the same problem. The shop failed to pinpoint the root cause of the problem. The problem was been miss-diagnosed over and over and it was obvious that the work that they claim had been done to that point had not corrected the underlying issue. 
7.	I sent an e-mail to the General Manager on September 16th explaining in detail the issues Iâ€™d been having; he doesnâ€™t respond but I get a call from the Service Manager the next day asking me to take the car in again. This was now the 7th or 8th time I did this. After a few days, I get a call and an e-mail saying they had now correctly diagnosed the root cause and it would cost approximately $2000 to fix. They now claimed it was a wiring harness issue, which they never mentioned during the initial visits and subsequent repairs. So at the end, I chose not to pay the additional $2000 as I felt it was unfair after all the initial work done was basically unnecessary and had failed to address or correct the main cause of the problem. Also, by this point I had lost all trust in them and I was not about to pay for any additional work. I did not get any type of credit for any or all of the initial repairs they claimed they did. This is absolutely the worst service I have ever experienced and would not trust this center with any future work. Furthermore, I intend to send a formal complaint to the BBB, to the Texas Attorney Generalâ€™s office and to the Asbury Automotive Group as I believe I was unfairly charged for work that was miss-diagnosed multiple times and which is now evident was unnecessary.

I bought my 2014 Nissan Altima at Sterling McCall Nissan in Stafford Texas in October of last year, because prior to my purchase my best friend had gone to McDavid Nissan to buy a Vehicle. She specified to the sales person what she wanted; she wanted a 2014 black Altima with sunroof, instead of him showing her the vehicle she wanted to see  the sales person proceed to asked her if she had a degree to which my friend responded, No!. The sales man told her that she was aiming to high that she was not going to be able to afforded and that he had older models for a more reasonable price. Long story short when I started to look for a vehicle I knew I was not going to go to McDavid. I when online to autotrader.com and found a vehicle that caught my attention and I called Sterling McCall Nissa they set up an appointment to go see the vehicle long story short the service at Sterling McCall was great I ended up driving out the dealership with the car that same day. They told me since I live almost an hour away from Stafford (I live in Houston) that if I had any problems or I had to take my car for oil change to take it to my nearest Nissan dealership.

About two weeks ago, my car started smelling humid I started to inspect my car and at the bottom behind the driver's seat it was really wet. I took my car to my nearest Nissan dealership (McDavid). The first time I called the service adviser was nice and made the appointment, I dropped off my car and she greet it me fine I got a rental; until that point everything was going smooth. I got a call the next day that my car was ready they had found the leak, she told me my car was leaking water trough the windshield and they had replaced the carpet but they could not replaced the windshield because it was an aftermarket windshield and my warranty would not cover. They advised me to call Sterling McCall and have them replaced the vehicle since I bought the car from them. Sterling did not wanted to take responsibility, I went to an auto glass company to get the windshield replaced and did all the necessary  test to make sure that water was leaking trough there. They told me they did not find a leak on the windshield, they gave me a diagnostic order and I went back to McDavid but they kept insisting that the windshield was leaking water so I went back to the auto glass company and got it replaced and once again they assured me that water never leaked trough the windshield. They took photos of the car where it showed no marks of marks of water. That was last Friday, I got home I parked my car and I did not drove it until Sunday like around 3 p.m. I wanted to make sure that the windshield sealed properly to avoid any problems. Sunday after driving my car, since it was raining I checked again the same spot were it had been wet and to my surprised it was pretty wet again. Monday I called 1800nissan1 and spoke with a representative and told them about my problem, I also told them that my car has 35200 miles and my warranty is about to expire at 36000 miles and McDavid did not fix my problem. I took my car again today to McDavid to get it inspected and they called me about 3 hours later saying that the leak was still there and that it was leaking in the exact same spot. I told them that I replaced the windshield last Friday and the guy told me to take it back and have them replace it again because that was the problem. After calling John at consumer affairs I got a call back from McDavid saying that they will keep the car over the weekend to inspected more.  I am so aggravated at this point this people at McDavid are so incompetent they do not care about their customers. Its clear that I have a problem with my car and they are just giving me the run around. I really hope I get my issue resolved and I will never never never buy another car from Nissan and I will make sure to let my family and friends not to buy from any Nissan dealership because once they get us to buy the vehicle we are useless for them.

Anselm Williams the sales rep  treated me very special and was very courteous to me. I will definitely buy form him whenever I need to buy a Nissan!

Rather than seeming like a sales scheme like several of the other dealerships were, I felt like this deal was actually meant to help me and not just about the money or profit.

95,"March 03, 2015","  I just wanted to write about my experience at this dealership. 
Before starting the search for my new Nissan Altima I had a big accident where I lost my left arm.  
  Now I know this has nothing to do with the car buying experience but it plays in effect into why I bought at this dealership.
   I searched online and came across a red Nissan Altima with leather seats.  The price online was very attractive and I knew would be in my budget since I owned a Nissan Maxima which saved my life in the car wreck.  Detectives said if it wasnâ€™t for the crumple zones on the Maxima I would probably not be here to tell my story. I will forever be a Nissan loyal customer. 
   I got in contact with a young lady through the online chat and asked her some questions about the car and the options.  She called me back in a matter of a few minutes and we had a very pleasant conversation. She told me about the Nissan rebates and APR incentives that Nissan offered at the current time and was very understanding of my current situation with transportation being limited. 
  We set an appointment to meet up on Saturday and take a look at the car and have my sister test drive it as I was nervous to drive it myself with not enough practice with my new life with 1 arm.  I arrived at McDavid Nissan on that Saturday and asked for Jaclyn.  She came out and greeted me and didnâ€™t make me feel awkward in any way and promptly asked me to take a seat.  She then had one of her team members bring up the Altima that I wanted to purchase from the online website. 
   We went out and looked at the Altima and I could tell that was the car I wanted.  I really wanted to get in the driverâ€™s seat and drive but the salesman asked if I was comfortable driving it since Jaclyn explained the situation I was in to him. I told him I was not ready to test drive but my sister would.  So she drove me around in the Car. 
  My salesman was very interested in showing me the cars options and features since I was just sitting in the back with him and my sister was driving.  He asked my sister to pull into a drive way at a local park in the area.  Upon parking we got out of the car and he showed us a few things about the car on the outside.  I explained how a drunk driver hit me head on in my last maxima and how it saved my life and he immediately told me about the safety features in this Altima with some extra upgraded features that my 2009 Maxima did not have.  
   To my surprise he walked me over to the driverâ€™s seat and asked me to have a seat. He shut the door and asked my sister to hop in the back.  He got in the passanger seat and asked me to drive.  I was in SHOCK! I asked him if he was sure and trusted me drivingâ€¦.. This would be the first time I drive since my accident.  He assured me this park was nice and safe and no traffic came through there.  So I put the car in drive and took off slowly.  
   We circled the part 2-3 times and I felt very good in the car and it was very comfortable. I felt confident once more that I could still function with normality when it comes to driving.  I drove the car back to the dealership since it was just around the block and with his help guiding me straight to the dealership. 
   We agreed on the terms and the deal on payments and price all seemed fair to me and I was comfortable with the whole situation.  So we went to finance and signed all the paperwork while my Altima was being washed.  I was offered water and snacks. 
    Upon finishing I went to take my car and my salesman walked me right out to the car. He then showed me the car one last time and went over some quick must know things about the car.  I was still in Shock that I got a new car and felt completely ok with it. Once it was all done I asked himâ€¦..how were you ok with me driving and not going crazy thinking we were going to crash with me driving 1 handed with my legs???  He looked at me and told me his mom had diabetes and her as well lost an arm and he helped her through the transition of driving and everyday things.  This instantly brought tears to my eyes and I gave him a big hug and thanked his so much. This kind of experience is once in a lifetime.  A great act of kindness. 
All in all I want to thank you Jaclyn and Ralph for the great service and you have a lifetime customer with a BIG family ?

On 02/12/2015 approximately 9AM, I called David McDavid Nissan. A sales, Niyela, was on the line. I asked her to quote me the drive-out price on a 2015 Juke SL, stock #FT501449, Vin # JN8AF5MR1FT501449. She stated that she will call me back after she gets the price from her manager. At approximately 11:30AM, Ms Niyela called back and stated she spoke with her manger and they agreed on a drive-out price of $26500 on the above vehicle (2015 Juke SL, stock #FT501449, Vin # JN8AF5MR1FT501449).  I asked her if the car is in stock. Ms Niyela confirmed that the car is in stock and available for sale. I told her to hold the vehicle and Iâ€™ll be at the dealership in the afternoon. At approximately 3:25PM, I arrived at the dealership and asked the reception lady to notify Ms. Niyela. Couple minutes later, another African American salesman shows up and stated he and Ms Niyela work as a team and he will be assisting with my purchase. He stated that Ms Niyela is their internet sales manager and was with another client at the time.  I told the salesman that I am here to finalize the deal on the 2015 Juke SL, stock #FT501449, Vin # JN8AF5MR1FT501449. The salesman stated ok and he said he will go check on it. 5 minutes later, the salesman came back and stated the car was sold yesterday; I have many other cars here, would you be interest to look at them. I stated no and I told him I would like to speak to their manager because I was told that the car was in stock before I came. Shortly, a person, identified himself as the manager, Ade, came out and spoke with me. He stated the car was sold last night 9PM, and that is why it was still not been removed from their website. He further stated that Ms. Niyela is not a manger and that is why she does not have access of knowing that the vehicle was already sold. I stated to Mr. Ade that I was told by Ms. Niyela that she stated she spoke with her manager and that is why she called me and gave me a drive-out price. I also stated that Ms. Niyela confirmed with me and her manager at 11:30AM today that the vehicle was available. I asked Mr. Ade how was that possible. Mr. Ade did not answer my question but instead offered to get me an exact same vehicle with exact options installed. I stated ok and asked for the price. Mr. Ade stated $29500. I asked Mr. Ade how come two exact same vehicle with a $3000 price difference. Mr. Ade stated that is how much we can offer. I asked him what about the $26500 which was offered before I came. Mr. Ade stated if you want this car, it is $29500.
I left the dealership after that.

He then told me that they were waiting on parts and that it would be about 2 hours and that he would call me. Again, I didn't hear back from him for the rest of the day. I talked to him again the next day at which point I was told the car was ready for me to come take it for a drive.

That was around noon and guess what...he never called me back! I went in the next morning and Alex was not working, which I was okay with. Another guy who didn't speak very much english tried to help me but insisted that I needed to fill out a credit application to take it for a test drive even though I had already given them my license and a copy of my insurance card.

At the time of purchase we asked for a 2nd car key & was told that they don't have another.   3 weeks after the purchase the key fob started to go bad. Sometimes it would work, sometimes it would not. Then on the 29th day after the sale date, the key fob stopped working all together. Called my salesman & I was told to take it to the local Jeep dealership. So since the key wouldn't start the Jeep I had to call roadside assistance to tow the vehicle. The warranty would NOT cover the key replacement. After talking with my salesman & his manager they said there is nothing they will do.  So after only 29 days , before I even got the license plates & made my 1st payment I have to pay $350 to replace the 1 & only key they gave us.

She even attempted to follow up with me after my extremely unpleasurable experience.

But when I arrived, the good experiences dropped off sharply. No one could direct me to my sales person, even when referred to by name.
I got to looking at the vehicle, and realized it had lots of aftermarket parts. Now mind you this makes a fairly knowledgeable experienced car buyer nervous. That's when the sales manager approached me telling me the car was single owner carfax certified and that he was familiar with the carfax.
Problem is, I was actually familiar with the carfax and it was a 4-owner car.
I noticed it had an aftermarket lowering-kit, which can cause serious problems. And low and behold it did. The wheels were cambered in which causes tires to feather and wear out in hundreds of miles instead of tens of thousands. I decided to see what they had to say about it.
They named one mechanic who ""worked on it"" then gave me a different mechanic. He told me the car was professionally done and the wheels were not cambered, when it clearly was. I had made up my mind that I was not making a purchase, but I decided to follow up on the rest of my experience.
They brought me in and started to deal.
They asked full price on the car, and offered me 1500 on my 2004 GMC Envoy XUV in very good condition with about 100,000.

121,"March 09, 2014","DO NOT GO HERE. I NEVER write reviews, but for what I went through at this dealership, I can't just keep it to myself. I came in looking for a different car and when I got there I was told that the car was sold and they offered to show me other vehicles which was fine with me. At first, everything was going well. I was helped by Ken Patrick. Once we began talking about numbers, everything changed. I am a 20 year old girl about to start college, so I guess to them I was a sucker who didn't know what she was doing. (And they were right) During our talk about monthly payments the salesman Ken Patrick was being extremely aggressive and increasingly becoming agitated, which honestly frightened me. He kept slamming down the papers and his pen and he would loudly sigh and push in his chair loudly when I wouldn't agree to a price. I was becoming very anxious and a little intimidated which I'm sure is what he wanted. In the end I just wanted out but I needed a car so I had just agreed to sign the papers that day and come back the next day to finish the payment. While I was signing the man who was helping me asked me how I wanted to pay the tax for the vehicle. That is something that should've been added to the whole total in the first place (which I didn't know at the time) it raised my monthly payment by FIFTY FIVE DOLLARS. THAT IS I FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR TOTAL I WOULD VE  BEEN PAYING JUST FOR ""tax"". THEY ARE CROOKS. PEOPLE NEED TO STEER CLEAR OF THIS PLACE I CANNOT STRESS IT ENOUGH. 

When I got home, a friend of mine (who is also a car salesman) asked me how everything went along and what I will end up paying. He immediately shook his head and went on to tell me that I was paying way too much money for this vehicle and I was getting completely screwed. I got very nervous and explained to him that I had already signed all the papers to which he let me know that as long as I didn't take the vehicle off the lot (which I didn't) it's the dealerships problem, not mine. So I breathed a sigh of relief happy that I wouldn't actually have to go back to that horrid place. (WHY did I even agree to sign?!?!) I was pressured and I let them get to me. 

I was honest to God afraid to call them up and tell them I wasn't going to take the car. I was worried they were going to try to bully me or scare me or even threaten me because I signed the papers. (Yes that's how horrifying my experience was). I decided to just move on to the next dealership AND did my homework so I know exactly what I was doing next time. 

For the next couple of days Nissan would call me and leave me messages, which I wouldn't listen to because I already knew the things they were going to be saying. A couple days later I decide to just see what they had to say. The messages were HORRIFYING. I have never in my entire life had someone talk to me in such a way, with such hostility and malice. I'm 20 years old and I'm embarrassed to say that I'm a sensitive person and I couldn't help but burst into tears. Is that what mcdavid calls customer service??? This Ken Patrick man made me feel like crap. I have never wished bad things upon anyone but this man. I will forever tell people to steer clear of this place it's HORRIBLE. They are crooks and what they call customer service I consider HARASSMENT. 

I actually found out a few of my friends were going to go to that dealership, and I thank God that I was able to warn them about the service of this place and referred them elsewhere (where I bought my vehicle with amazing customer service, and made me feel so comfortable I know I will be a life time customer. I will not say where I went because I don't want anyone to think I'm trying to promote another dealership, this is my very real experience that no one else should have to go through.)

I began looking online to see if I was interested in a vehicle. I did see something that caught my attention, I called and spoke with Ms. Sylvia. She performed the conversation in full details with great pleasant professionalism. She gave full quality and invited me to come out and view the vehicle(s) of my interest. We set a date/time, and I was there. She came out and introduced herself, welcomed my and my family.
We met a sales professional, Mr. Michael Conner, absolutely amazing. Mr. Michael is a very pleasant man, he was very thorough throughout the entire visit. He was detailed in explaining the functions of the vehicles as well as a performance presentation.  Michael Conner explained the details within the paper work and every step throughout my visit. Any questions I had, we would explain to my understanding, making sure
Everything set well within me and my purchase. I truly appreciate Michael, his honesty and professionalism is THE main reason, I sealed my deal on my 2013 Rogue. I have met and dealt with many salesman, I have NEVER encountered the type of professionalism Michael, Sylvia, Mr. Roger in the financing office has given me on the day of July 25,2013. UNBEATABLE experience and this great customer service from the entire staff is the reason I purchase the same day I visited McDavid Nissan.
I rated with a perfect score because I did receive the perfect service that just won't happen anywhere else.

I then obtained some bids via CarWoo and your dealership had the best pffer so I called and asked what I needed to do to have financing done and come in and get the auto. We were approved and we came in and told the salesmen the price we were quoted on the Murano S we had asked about and he said all was OK.

They looked at our trade and made and offer on it and I agreed ad then we went to the finance dept.

I told them I did not want these items and was told all of the new auto's had this added and we would have to order a car to get one that did not have this added abd we would have to wait weeks for the car to come in. Then I seen the sales price was 890.00 higher than the 26,390.00 CarWoo had obtain from you dealership. When I brought this up the F&I manager said there was no way they could sell the Murano for that, By this time I had drag my wife in to your dealership two times and we walked the first time and I did not want to go thru this again so I sign.

Instead of making eye contact with me while he was talking he was busy watching the TV.  Needless to say I was less then impressed with his customer service.  I wanted to tell him what was really on my mind at that point but I kept my mouth shut for the sake of avoiding conflict.  It was late 7:30, I am a nurse, working 12 hour shifts, and didn't get off till 7 that night so I didnt leave the dealership till almost 10:30.  I was exhausted.  Tillman made it a pleasurable experiance.  He was very nice, personable, and friendly.  I am still disappointed that they did not give me more for my vehicle on trade in.  It was a top of the line 2011 Ford edge sport with 41,600 miles in excellent condition and initially the manager wouldn't even give me what I owed on the car, 24 and change, when I know they were going to turn it around and sell it for at least 30,000.  Needless to say before I signed I got them to bump the price up a little but was still slightly disappointed because it was worth a lot more.  Despite the fact that I didn't get as good of a deal on my trade in as I wanted, I got my Nissan for about what I paid for my ford so I was overall happy.

They forgot to tell me the one person was enterprise rentals!!!  Next, it honestly has a skunky smell.  I was told to bring it in to have it cleaned.  When I got there, their ""guy"" wasn't there. I was told the car had some warranty left...only the motor and powertrain so it appears.  So, the popping and rattling going on in the front end is my responsibility!  Come on, a 2012?   So, I told them this was unacceptable...and they ""checked"" on getting me out of it.  I called tonight after three full days, and he said, ""oh, I forgot, let me call you back"".  Two hours later, I call again to hear, ""yeah...uh, sorry, we aren't going to be able to help you"".  I guess that's that, I am the proud owner of a 2012 car with front end issues, and skunk smell, and that was an enterprise rental car.  I have been buying mostly new, and some used, cars for thirty years in Houston...and NEVER have walked out with such a poor deal and had such uncaring people that lied to me about being a one owner car...yadda, yadda.  I will never go back there again.  This is a joke.  I need to get my 2012 into the shop already, and lord knows what that will cost.  I would honestly avoid them like the plague.  If you do go, take your time, don't let them rush you, read every fine detail, get everything in writing!!!!

The manager said he wouldnt give her any numbers and allow her to shop around.  Those are his words. I am stunned by theri refusal to make a deal with my wife.  The irony is that their vehicle was the one we were favoring, and needless to say, we will NEVER buy a vehicle from a McDavid dealership ever.  I will be sure to let everybody I know to be aware of their customer service to women.  We will happily be buying another Armada from one of the other two dealerships this evening.  ",1.4

Be very careful of this place it (in my opinion) is not a normal Nissan deanship where they check the cars over to make sure itâ€™s not been modified and you get a good product. They seem to not care about what the sales team is telling the customer.

206,"May 31, 2011","Let me start by saying I am not an employee...just an extremely satisfied customer. After several weeks of car shopping, I was starting to get annoyed. I had been to all the dealerships on my side of town and shopped forever online. I never really got a good ""vibe"" from any of the dealerships...plus they always tried to change their offers. I decided to stop by David McDavid before calling it quits and just sticking with my car. I'm really glad I stopped in. The people in the Used car area were amazing! Everyone that I worked with was very respectful and had a great sense of humor. Daniel Delgadillo was the salesman that I worked with. He was very nice and hard working from the beginning. I decided on a Sentra...but when it came time to finance, I started to have second thoughts. I actually sat and waited for nearly an hour for the finance person before I walked back to Daniel to let him know I changed my mind. (They were all very apologetic about the wait...the finance guy even called me to apologize!) He allowed me to take the car for the weekend to get a better feel for it. It was a nice little car, but not what I was looking for. It was the base model and had a few flaws that I couldn't look past. I brought the car back in and explained my concerns to Daniel, letting him know that I thought he was great and would love to do business with him but this wasn't the car for me. WELL...as it turns out, they had just received a trade in that he thought would fit me much better. He had already sent it to get cleaned so he could show it to me when I came in. The car had way fewer miles and way more ""convenience options""...and they agreed to give it to me for the same price (way below KBB). On top of that, I got really low financing. He let me take it for a spin and I loved it! I went to the financing office and worked with Jonathan Graham who was very patient (I kept calling people to get advice on extra warranties and such)...and he was HILARIOUS! Seriously..ask him about some of the pranks he pulled when he was just starting out. 

Anyways...I'm rambling now mostly because these people made my experience so enjoyable and I love them for it! I would do business with them again in a heartbeat and strongly recommend them to everyone. It is honestly shocking to read the negative comments on here because their experience is completely opposite from mine. I guess situations are what you make of them.

215,"March 26, 2011","Don't do it - do some research - Buyer Beware!!!!!!!!!!!!

I was searching on-line for a 2011 Nissan and got excited about the so called internet pricing - be aware of the product you are shopping for and be educated.  Originally found this Dealer on Cars.com and felt reasonably comfortable with the shopping on-line experience until . . . . Yea, you guessed it!!!! That deal was too good to be true.  This Dealer, McDavid Nissan, takes a baseline car and has an outside service to beef it up to seem as though it is the real McCoy.  But don't you believe for a minute, even their advertisement is misleading to an untrained eye.  So, Buyer beware!!!!!!!!!!!!  Research all the options and make certain to be cautious of details.  If you want a car with imitation aftermarket dress-up parts, bells & whistles, this is the place to go.  But if you want a true manufacturer product with real re-sale value, do not purchase a vehicle from this Dealer.  They re-define Dealer if you ask me.  I believe their marketing and presentation of the Nissan product is unfair to the Manufacturer and to the general public.  I am soooo thankful that I did not allow myself to be overtaken by these guys.  Not to mention making a four hour drive to their showroom for a vehicle that was not truly as it should be and based on other readings - probably did not even exists.

This is the email I sent her describing my visit:

""Hi Venessa,

I visited your location this Saturday. Janie with the Finance Dept, called me, she said to come there, that they are offering options for my situation and even if I don't have the down payment now, something could be arranged. When I arrived, I was approached by a salesperson immediately before I could even get out the car. I can't remember his first name. I believe his last name is of Middle Eastern descent. I spoke with him about who called me, why I came, who told me to come by (Janie), later he said he has no idea who that is. He did not direct me to the finance dept, to Janie, or even offer to. At first, I thought well maybe it was a way for me to come in, so if they can get me in the car I want and they can even finance me based on what Janie and your email said, of course I want the opportunity.

He has me test drive the car that I like. Which was not easy task b/c I had my 9-month with me. But I thought ""Hey I'll be driving off today in a new car!"" He has me fill out a credit app. Which I thought I already did, since Janie called me and according to your email, I was already approved by the bank.

He goes to the Finance Dept, and comes back asking for a $2,000 DP, I said I don't have that. $2000?? He goes back 2-3 other times, coming back within a minute from talking to your ""finance manager"" supposedly trying to see if it has to be 2K, keep in mind I can see him the glass door the whole time. And OF COURSE, he comes back with some story and I have to have a 2K down payment. First off, he didn't know, that I already financed on my own and was offered over 17K and less than $1,000 DP. But I thought if I financed through McDavid, it may be a little better. Now, I know that is NOT true. And that pissed me off that he tried to get me to pay more than what I have to.

Now, if I would've been told that over the phone, that they are offering loans to people with my situation but it requires a large down payment, then of course I would say ""No, thank you"" and would've not come in and wasted your time or mine. 

Based on the information that was sent through car.com, it outlined my credit situation, and that's why you contacted me. If my credit was ""that bad"" and required such a large down payment or cosigner, I honestly don't think you or Janie would have contacted me. It would, of course, be a waste of time. If my credit was ""that bad"" why I was financed through a bank for a larger amount and for a lesser down payment? 

I again, after telling me I have to have a 2K down payment, asked for Janie, he said he doesn't know who that is. Then myself, being embarrassed, annoyed I drove all the way there with my child and wasted my time for over an hour, and lastly embarrassed by the whole situation, I asked is it even possible to trade in my vehicle. 2008 Honda Accord. Great condition. Recently appraised at a Toyota dealership for $13,500. $14,500 at a Honda dealership. He didn't even look at the car, not once, just glanced out of the window from our table and offered $12,000 because they use some NADA value or whatever. To be honest, he was not a good ""fibber"". But according to your email, ""Our goal is to have our inventory, financing and fair trade value on your current vehicle to make this your best car-buying experience ever!"".  <----so 12K for an '08 Honda Accord is fair? I highly doubt that. 

So basically it was either 2K down payment or a cosigner. I could have figured that out myself, that's common sense as well. Seeing as I have been looking for a car for sometime now. Also, I feel like that could've been told to me over the phone. I live 45 minutes away from your location, and I drove all the way there thinking I could really be helped, and I wasn't. That is very disappointing. Gas in not cheap, nor my time, since I came in with young child, and was ""jerked"" around for over an hour.

There is a 99.99999% chance I will not recommend this dealership to several of my friends and family members who currently drive Nissans and looking for a new Nissan. Especially my younger sibling who wanted to come with me, ready to purchase, I'm glad I didn't waste her time too. 

I felt like I was called with false pretenses, ie from your email: ""We have an approval for you from the bank"" <---Obviously not, because I didn't drive away with a vehicle. I feel and somewhat know I was just called to come in just so some salesman could meet his ""How many people did you see today"" quota. Very annoyed and disappointed. Not a good experience at all. Now, my credit has been pulled ONCE again because this.""

Really check them out because what you will find, including the manager/owner, is really working for the circus because they are a bunch of clowns.",1.0
223,"June 27, 2006","This was the worst dealership I have ever worked with. They are dishonest, and will lie, beg, and deceive all in the to make a sell. I even asked the manager how he can sleep at night knowing how bad he is screwing people. He simply replied, ""I sleep fine, especially after making a sell to people like you."" What a jerk. By the way, after much ruckus, I brought my car back and have vowed to ruin thier reputation every chance I get.",1.0
