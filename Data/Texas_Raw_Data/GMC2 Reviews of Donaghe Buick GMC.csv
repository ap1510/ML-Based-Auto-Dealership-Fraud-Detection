0,"November 06, 2015","Over the last 5+ years, I have bought 5 vehicles from Southwest Buick GMC, for myself, wife and daughters.  Always a great experience.  They also give a straight up price, no stereo-typical dealership run  around, and never any pressure.  GMC and Buick products are high quality built, and very well designed.  Also high marks for the service department.  I cannot express enough gratitude for the professionalism mixed with a laid back atmosphere.  Thank you Justin and Skyler!",5.0
1,"April 16, 2015","I recently purchased a new truck from this dealership and after driving it for a few days and having multiple issues with the onstar system i decided that i made a bad decision, I called the dealership to try and get my old truck back but was advised that it was too late. It has been a week today and my onstar still doesnt work the salesman said that he would take care of the issue for me after multiple attempts on my end with onstar have failed. I still havent heard from him or onstar, poor customer service they were very eager to sell me the truck but left me out to dry after the purchase. If you want a great experience purchasing a new vehicle steer clear of this dealership.",2.0
