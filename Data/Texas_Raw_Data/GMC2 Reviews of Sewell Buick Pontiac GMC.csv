1,"June 18, 2010","I came to this dealership after a HORRIBLE experience at Vandergriff Toyota so I was very apprehensive when I arrived. Luckily I had Steven helping me find a car. After the test drive he took me back to his office offered me a water and started to negotiate the price of the car. He took the price down to my budget and recommended that I not get the extended warranty just yet because my car still had some time left on the remaining factory warranty. He also negotiated a great price for my trade in. After I went to the financing department which was fast and they didn't try to force any additional options that I had mentioned I didn't want. After finishing with financing Steven helped me move some of my things from my old car into my new one, showed me how to work everything in my car including how to adjust the mirrors correctly. I was so impressed by him and everyone at the dealership and I couldn't be happier with my car. GO HERE NOW!!",5.0
