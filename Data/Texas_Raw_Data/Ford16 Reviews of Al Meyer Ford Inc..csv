0,"March 22, 2020",Was told my loan would be approved only if I took the extended warranty. Confirmed with loan office and they told me this was not true. Now they’re only willing to prorate something I never wanted. I’m a first time car buyer so I didn’t know any better on what to look or ask for. I was definitely taken advantage of. Absolute terrible customer service. ,1.0
1,"September 11, 2019","I went in with a problem. . They cared about what I was dealing with and went out of their way to make sure it was corrected. Not only did they fix the problem,  they won me over. My whole attitude is totally different about this dealership. Jerald Hale, Carl Crane, Jose Castillo, Ben Boyle, and Chris (service dept.) are absolutely the best to work with. Not only was my daughter's problem fixed, I ended up leaving in a brand new car. The experience was truly a blessing. If you have questions, give them a chance and you will leave with a smile on your face just like I did. ",5.0

15,"December 29, 2018","Gotta take a minute and brag on service at Al Meyer Ford.
If you know me, you know I LOVE my vehicles. My SHO is turning over 80K miles this week.
Had it in for oil change at Al Meyer Ford. In the process of rotating the tires, the key to the wheel locks got striped. I considered it ""wear and tear"". Vikki, the service manager wouldn't have ANY OF THAT. Not only did she order a replacement, but she put me in a loaner car.(no way to change a flat). When the replacement key came in, it striped too! Long story short, they ordered a whole new set of locking lugs and key, pounded the old ones off and replaced. Never once did anyone point a finger at another shop or try to up sell me anything I didn't need. Must have been 4 people from service that came by when I picked up my car to make sure I was happy. If YOUR car needs a new service home, give AL Meyer Ford a try.",5.0
