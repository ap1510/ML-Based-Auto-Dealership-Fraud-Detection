0,"September 23, 2016","We purchased a new Jeep from Joe Bratton in sales.  He was professional in every way.  The whole transaction went well including the trade in.  No high pressure or added fees was appreciated. 
We would recommend Joe specifically, and the dealership in general.

3,"September 07, 2016",This is the place that you wants to stay far away from!! I was giving them the benefit of doubts but not only I paid money for jobs that didn't need to be done but they never mange to find the real fault in my car!! Took it to two different mechanic and they both agreed that they've messed up big time and made my car worst that what it was. Don't let them fool you they are incompetent dishonest and will overcharge you!!,1.4

5,"November 19, 2015",I had been shopping around for about a month for a new truck.  I seemed to be getting the run around and could not get an accurate price from anyone.  Brad at Killebrew was upfront and when I did the deal nothing changed and i got exactly what I was looking for.  great job and I will be back,5.0
6,"June 09, 2015","I brought my car in for a check engine light and service shifter message. I was given it back later that day saying I just needed a computer update. By the time I got home, the same messages were still occurring plus much more... transmission issues. Not drivable.

We made an appointment and said we'd be out of town for a week. When we came back it hadn't even been looked at and they can't offer a loaner until it is looked at. How am I supposed to get to work, take kids to daycare?
Add in I live out of town and have 2 car seats needed to transport my kids.

MY CAR IS UNDER WARRANTY!

Another week goes by. No phone call. When we get ahold of somebody we get a bunch of crawfishing and ""I don't know"" for answers.

STILL NO VEHICLE! I'm not asking for my vehicle. I'm not asking for my vehicle to be taken care of first. I'm just asking for anything with 4 wheels and an engine at this point.

Another week goes by. Hallelujah! They looked at it. But we're told they weren't getting the error messages we described 3 weeks agoand nothing came thru the scan, so we can pick it up when we're ready. xxx?! It went from undrivable to just fine just like that? The next day they drove it again and miraculously found the errors and picked up a scan. It'll be a week before we can get the parts we need but we can get you a loaner now...

...perhaps. although a reservation has been made, they're short on vehicles so we can't guarantee anything.

Another week, calling to confirm my reservation. Again, the only answers to my questions are ""I don't know. Call enterprise."" So I do. Enterprise hasn't heard of me yet. So here I am, in my fourth week without a vehicle. Tired from figuring out how to get to and from everyday as I drag my two car seats around with me since I never know where my next ride is coming from.",1.0

8,"March 01, 2014","So here is my experience with this poor dealership. My fiance and I one day decided one friday to stop and see if they could get us the jeep we wanted to trade our current jeep in on. We specifically told them what we want. 2013 Jeep Unlimited, Rubicon 10th Anniversary Edition, Anvil Color, With Red Leather Interior. A tall very specific order yes we understand. So the salesman punched into his computer says there are a few in the state. We picked one from a sheet of stock photos and lists of options. We were then rushed into the managers office to do some paper work. By some paper work I mean sign for a Jeep we have never saw in person. While during this whole process we were a bit skeptical they had they're car dealer charm that made us feel somewhat easy. We asked to see pictures prior to have the car shipped to us just to make us feel comfortable and it was simple brushed off. Once the paper work was finished and we essentially bought a jeep that didn't exist we were told it would be here on monday. So monday comes around and they call and say that there are some problems with the other dealer they are getting it from and they will keep us updated. So two weeks later we get a call and our jeep was in. We were so excited because this experience was already stressful enough. So we pull up and I see the jeep sitting there and it was gorgeous. The manager was there and I walk up and shake his hand he seemed a bit standoffish. I walked to the window and I looked inside and the interior was black. I said to him the interior is the wrong color. His reply was this is the only 10th anniversary Rubicon in the state. I replied that doesn't change the fact that its the wrong jeep. So here is what really blew me away and put the preverbal nail in the coffin for this dealership. He smugly told me well its not a big deal they have another buyer interested. So the jeep that you brought here for me specifically that you knew wasn't the right one, and now your already trying to sell it out from under me. Well that was that and we told them we would take our business elsewhere. Terrible attitude and customer service and I wouldn't buy a water from this place if I was dying of thirst. I suggest taking your business somewhere else if you want an enjoyable experience.",1.0
9,"March 13, 2013",Very easy deal. Professional staff no pressure buying. Will consider repeat business it's about 6 hours from where I live. I always try to deal local but this was the easiest buying experience I've had to date. Only thing I didn't like is when I purchased my extended warranty thought it was Chrysler's but its a third party (easy care). I'm debating on canceling that. I would recommend this dealer.,4.8
10,"August 17, 2012",Very pleasant experience due to my salesman who was low pressure and very laid back... I have to say this was my most pleasant auto buying experience yet... If i'm to buy another car I would seek out the same salesperson....Everyone at the dealership was very kind and pleasant but not in a fake sort of way... Very genuine people....,5.0
11,"August 14, 2012",Best dealership I have ever dealt with. Very friendly in every department. Willing to work with you to find the right car for your needs and price.Would definitely recommend buying a car from Killlebrew! ,5.0
12,"July 27, 2012","I've gotta say this is the best experience I've ever had buying a car..these guys now how to get it done without railroading you like Mak Haik... I got a fair price and equally nice payments... all without the usual haggling...thanks to Donald, Joe, and I'm sorry but I forgot the finance guys name but he was cordial and straight forward..thank you!!!! Victor from Victoria..",5.0
13,"July 20, 2012","This is the third vehicle bought by our family from Killebrew, & when it's time for the next one we will be back! Joe Bratton is not pushy, which lets us take our time to decide, & he is willing to show us all of the options we have. David & Eli in the service department went above & beyond to help with a car problem we had. If it's a good deal & good people you are looking for, Killebrew is your place to go!",5.0
14,"July 15, 2012","This is the second car that I have purchased from Killebrew and I am very satisfied with the transaction.  I looked online and located a car of interest.  I went to the dealership to test drive the car and was treated very well.  The sales people were not pushy or rude, which is a major plus in my opinion.  Donald brought the car around and was very easy to talk to and knowledgeable about the vehicle.  After the test drive, I noticed another car on the lot that interested me.  Donald had no problem getting the keys and going on another test drive.  Overall, I believe he spent 2 hours helping me out.  I left that evening without purchasing a vehicle but showed up the next morning and purchased my dream car.  Pleasant experience and a wonderful crew!  Thanks Donald!   ",5.0
15,"July 01, 2012","Great price, customer service & friendly staff.  This is my 4th vehicle in 4 years purchased from Killebrew & always a great experience.  Highly recommend this dealer ",5.0
16,"June 09, 2012","Seventeen years of owning the same vehicle made this a huge decision for us. Donald and Mark were very reasurring and supportive to both of us. They answered many questions and explained all our options. Donald searched extensively for our specific features. He also showed us so much about how to use the many safety features and advantages. We are so grateful for our beautiful and amazing jeep grand cherokee. It really is more than we ever thought possible! Larry got us a super low financing rate and explained exactly how everything works with our credit and lender. David reaserched and explained how to add towing equipment. Everyone made us feel comfortable with our purchase. This is a huge leap forward for us and we are thrilled with the way it has turned out! Thanks everyone, Sandra V",4.8
17,"June 05, 2012","We have always had the pleasure of dealing with Joe Bratton, and Mark in finance, we have been going to Killebrew for aprox. 10 years, it's not a high pressure sales staff, they listen to what customers need/want, I have never thought that I paid to much after the sale, I feel I have always received a very good price on anything I have bought there.",5.0
18,"May 31, 2012","I visited the dealership with no intentions of getting a ""new"" vehicle, that same day. I was working with Mr. Donald Stewart, via email, and he invited me to come in, for a test drive. I test drove a Jeep Compass and was very impressed! Mr. Stewart and the staff at Killebrew were professional and courteous. I left Killebrew a very satisfied customer, in my new Jeep Compass!",4.8
19,"April 25, 2012",Zac as usual did a wonderful job. He got us an even better deal than he did when we bought a new Jeep 9 months ago. Thanks to Patrick for his help. Alex was great also. I will HIGHLY recommend this dealership to my family and friends.,5.0
20,"April 24, 2012","Excellent customer service, above & beyond necessary. Very attentive & willing to go beyond what was needed. Will use again.

The car meets all expectations. All personnel knowledgeable & attentive.",5.0
21,"April 23, 2012","I purchased a jeep from Killebrew, with Don Stewart as my sales rep.  He was great to work with!  I did all my research online and had email conversations with Don to work out the details. He was prompt in his responses, and very helpful.  I have to say my experience was very nice. I would definitely recommend working with Don and purchasing another vehicle from Killebrew!",4.8
22,"October 13, 2011",The price was the best I could find for 200 miles. The service I received was top notch and thier willingness to put me in a truck (the truck I wanted not the one they try to force u into at other dealerships) I want and the payment I wanted. It encouraged the person I was with to buy a used truck that very night at the same time. So we left with two trucks that night. ,5.0
23,"September 10, 2011","Today was the worst experiece I had in a long time with a dealership. 
I was very dissapointed that our sales man did not committed to what he told us he was going to do with the car before we pick it up. 
Car suppose to get detail and it was not detail.He just give me an excuse that the detail place was full and they did not had room for it. Sorry but I did not believe what I was told. He just did not committed to take care of the car as he said that he was going to do. Than When My Family and I got there to see the vehicle he make us felt like we had to get the car, we felt so much pressure that we decided not to take the vehicle becasue of what he said. His approach was very rude, and we felt he was up-sad about it because we could not make our decision right away and get done with the deal, So he make a comment that if we were not going to get the car, he had some people that wanted to look at it and they want it to see it. I believe in customer service to the start of a conversation and to the end of a great deal, because I live customer service everyday and I work with a retail company. Guys that was uncall for it and that was why me and my family decided not to purchase the car.

I will not comeback to shop with you guys and I will make sure that my friends and Family will not go to Killerbrew Dealership in Victoria Texas.  ",2.4
24,"August 02, 2011","I had never bought a car before, but Killebrew made it SO easy! They didnt have the car I wanted on the lot, but they looked all over Texas and found it!I would use them again in a heartbeat!",4.8
25,"June 03, 2011","Customer service was excellent and the entire staff was friendly, knowledgeable and easy to deal with. I visited the Ford dealership in Victoria before going to Killebrew and was not happy with Ford's pricing and felt their advertised ""red tag"" price was deceptive. I will recommend Killebrew to friends and family.",4.8
26,"May 20, 2011","David Ortiz was an awesome sales man.  I went there with the intention of just looking and after speaking with him for awhile, decided to buy.  He was friendly and never tried to push anything on us. Was very respectful and had alot of patience.  He was great and I will go back again next time I need a new vehicle.",5.0
27,"April 26, 2011","David Ortiz was nothing short of wonderful to work with.  I was shopping for a new car.  He had just the vehicle I was looking for.  Fantastic price and service beyond belief.  As I was leaving the dealership the owner Mr Killebrew, came out to thank me for my business.  Something you never see at any other dealership.  I would strongly recomend Killebrew Inc.  David is fantastic.",5.0
28,"March 30, 2011",Wanting to say thankyou to David Ortiz for being so helpful in finding me the truck i wanted not only did he find the right truck for me but also helped me in chooising the right options for my new truck somthing that other dealers would have never done and for that he made a custermer for life thank you David Ortiz ,5.0
29,"February 17, 2011",Killebrew Dodge Chrysler Jeep is a great dealership.  They work very hard to provide the buyer the best collection of offers available. They are very detailed and professional in all aspects of their business and very personable to the customer.  I highly recommend anyone who has the determination to purchase a new or used vehicle allow Killebrew to provide their expertise for their purchase.....Bob La Bonte,5.0
30,"November 25, 2010","David was great.  He answered all my questions, found me cars within my price range, and then was very patient with me while I took each for a test drive.  After the sale, he kept in touch with me to make sure I was happy and satisfied with my Kia Sportage.  Next time we need a car, we will go see David and the crew at Killebrew",5.0
31,"November 24, 2010","This has to be the first dealership I have walked into and did not feel any pressure to purchase a vehicle. Mr. Ortiz answered all my questions, walked me around the lot to look and did not say anything just let me look at the truck type I was interested it. Once I saw something that I liked he went and picked up the keys and let me test drive it, (again no pressure to buy this truck, just small talk while I test drove the truck)once we came back we talked again just small talk, then Mr. Ortiz asked me if I would like a bottom line price, I said yes, when he came back with the bottom price I was really surprised, I received top value trade in for my vehicle and bottom price for the new vehicle. It was a great experience. No hassle, no tricks, no gimmicks, just a honest deal. Paperwork was quick and no waiting around again Mr. Hamilton answered all my question while doing the final paperwork.. I will recommend this dealership to any one of my family and friends.",5.0
