When they set my sensors they were not done correctly. I called Micheal and he got me right in. Assured I had a loaner so that I would not be inconvenienced. This is my 3rd Volvo and because of Micheal Montes and the excellent service department, I will always own a Volvo from Autobahn.",5.0

I did not care for the finance person’s pushy sales tactics for add-on warranties.

107,"March 21, 2019","As always, excellent work, problem solved.  RE the 2019 S60 loaner car.  Not sure I would consider buying one.  Just minor items:  stitching seam on steering wheel was rough.  No vanity mirror on passenger side for companion. Iddy-biddy gas tank capacity.  Touch screen requires a dictionary to operate.  Cruise control sluggish.  Mounting cruise on control at same level and right below return to speed poor choice, especially if driver is wearing gloves that don't fit the very small buttons.  Transmission whines when accelerating more than expected.  Otherwise, car loaded with typical Volvo quality and comfort.

129,"February 09, 2019","I would recommend them since they are very nice, get a loan car when you come in, pretty fast service/same day, etc.  However, the prices for service are way too high and not competitive, and they wouldn't accept my 15% off coupon that was mailed to me.  Funny how all three items recommended for service were already ""discounted"" so was told you can't use coupon.  Maybe they should advertise those specials along with the mailer/coupon so it's more clear.  I'll be back but I do some things myself like change cabin filter/air filter and engine filter.  Cost me about $50, they wanted over $300.  I'm going to look into taking it to someone else for more major repairs.  ",4.0

I'll never go anywhere else for service or repairs on my Volvo.

186,"September 21, 2018",Jessica (my service rep today) was super nice and happy to be at work. She obviously likes her job and is good with customers.  Their newly designed waiting room is also very nice. Less media and more quiet time in super comfortable chairs is a good thing. I am sure the service techs did their job fine too - just never saw them - as expected.,4.8
187,"September 18, 2018",Our experience at Autobahn was smooth and quick. Our sales associate (Mr Howard) was very knowledgeable and finance was quick. Overall we are very pleased and would consider buying a vehicle from there again in the future. ,5.0
188,"September 15, 2018",\the regular service was done promptly and jeff is excellent at his job.  my one complaint would be that when doing a tire rotation the service section does the calibration on the tire pressure.  this is the second time I had low pressure readings after leaving the dealership and had to check my tire pressure and then calibrate.  ,4.6
189,"September 13, 2018","This is the fourth car we have purchased with Autobahn, two VW's and two Volvos. Obviously, we have had wonderful experiences. Three years ago, we purchased a Volvo from Reed Bulaich and we requested him as our salesman for this latest purchase. Reed was knowledgeable and considerate enough to look through inventory multiple times to find the best car for us. He assisted us with test driving all the options we were considering and made the entire experience easy. I highly recommend Reed to other car shoppers. 

Robert Bell was our finance specialist. We have worked with him before and again found him to be pleasant, knowledgeable, quick and professional. 

We will continue to be repeat customers!

198,"August 29, 2018","While everything was exceptional, the best part compared to many past car purchases was how quickly the purchase (actually a lease) process went.  After a few e-mails with Reed and a brief financial questionnaire completed on line the night before, it took maybe 15 minutes to go over the paperwork and sign everything in Finance when we went in to pick up the car.

We would have been complete and out in 30 minutes except Reed took the time to go over the car and explain all the features (quite a few of them - especially the electronics) and help us set the car up to our preferences.  He definitely saved me time having to go through the manual in detail as soon as we got home. 

Definitely, the best and most pleasant car acquisition I have had.    ",5.0

My 2014 XC 60 was scheduled for a 55K Service and my sons 2009 S-40, Texas motor vehicle State inspection.  All requisite paper work was already filled out for a loaner car and the team inside, quickly verified our drivers liscence, insurance, etc. and we were promptly on our way.  Within 24 hours we received the call to advise our cars were ready for pickup.  As usual the cars were washed and all requirements were performed professionally as required.  Both vehicles drove like brand new.  I sincerely say this as the ride of our vehicles was comparable to the ride of the loaner car, a truly magnificent vehicle S-90
A special thank you to Mike, who is also part of the team that is always hustling and likewise ensuring customer satisfaction is optimized. 

Thank you Autobahn Volvo Service Team

Customer service was great as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            ,4.8

217,"July 28, 2018",They did the work that I needed as I stated as well as some recalls on car. They communicated with me everything done and checked and I felt comfortable with driving my car out of there. They are highly customer oriented there and do an excellent job on servicing volvos. ,5.0
218,"July 27, 2018","I had my vehicle dropped off and the shuttle brought me home. At the end of the day, my vehicle was not ready so Jeff arranged for a loaner. Two days later my the service was completed. Within five miles of leaving the dealership I soon realized that one of the problems that the vehicle was brought in for was not done or repaired. I returned and was told that it would take a additional four hours with added cost. I couldn’t wait, so again a loaner vehicle was provided. The next morning I was called and told my vehicle was ready. 
Jeff informed me that the repair was completed and the added cost that I was quoted was written off by Autobahn Volvo. 
Thanks Jeff for going above and beyond your scope of responsibilities in making your customer pleased. You are an asset to Autobahn. ",4.6

228,"July 12, 2018","This is my second Volvo from Autobahn Volvo. The service after the sale is exceptional. I receive email reminders for scheduled maintenance. They make it easy to schedule service appointments online. The service team is friendly and welcoming. My arrival is anticipated, and Jeff always greets me when I pull into the service bay. They offer a complimentary car wash, I like driving away in my clean car after service. This past week I used a loaner car for the first time, a XC90 SUV.  Mary Jean oriented me to the loaner and its features. What an impressive vehicle, and a joy to drive - I can't stop thinking about that car! I live in McKinney and choose Autobahn in Fort Worth to shop for and service my Volvos - because customers and customer service are valued here!",5.0
229,"July 11, 2018",My wife and I purchased a new XC90 SUV from Autobahn Volvo this past Saturday. I have never owned a Volvo before and this was my first SUV buying experience with Autobahn Volvo.

Micheal Montes is very responsive and assures that everything is done right on my car before it is returned to me. They always provide me a loan car that meets my needs. I would have a difficult time switching from a Volvo to anything else because of the service I receive here.,5.0
231,"June 29, 2018",I went in for an electrical problem but also asked if they could repair a small paint scratch on a piece of trim. I didn’t expect a yes on that one.

Finally after visiting the dealership and looking at the inventory of cars, options and prices, we were able to pick a model of XC90 we liked. Piers made the whole process easier and we took home the car same day. ",5.0

244,"June 08, 2018","We knew what car we wanted and Autobahn made it easy to complete the transaction.  The only negative is there was no negotiating the sell price established by the owner and that never sets well with me as I have to negotiate in my field of business and everything is negotiable in life except at Autobahn.   Otherwise, the sales people were knowledgeable and worked well with one another.  The finance guy was the best I’ve ever seen although we used our own financing.  He was real, and didn’t play the typical games at other dealers.  Overall great experience and I will go there for our next car purchase.  ",4.6

I count on Autobahn Volvo service to keep me driving and my current vehicle now has 130K+ miles to prove it. Thanks to Micheal Montes, getting my car serviced is NEVER an inconvenience for me.. If I come in for a simple service like I did Tuesday (an oil change), I know that your mechanics will do a  thorough check of my vehicle and make me aware of imperative services that will need to be attended to. When there are issue that need immediate addressing, I never stress. Micheal has me in a loaner (always an SUV because of my lifestyle) and I am out the door in no time. When my vehicle is ready, again, it is prompt and professional. I have shared my experiences with many people over the years.

Couple of reason, the number of vehicle the dealer had to show to us was good. No pushy talks, they know how to treat.

When I expressed doubt, Lisa took me back to the shop and the technician Chris was nice enough to show me the problems so I could better understand the situation. I had mentioned a stiff ride and wondered about the shocks. It turns out that a broken engine mount was the culprit and the shocks were fine.  They completed the repairs quickly and the ride quality is noticeably improved.  ",4.8
267,"May 11, 2018","Recently, we had a dead battery on our 2014 Volvo XC90 — while waiting for roadside assistance to arrive I called Jeff Allen in the Autobahn Volvo service department. Jeff was able to quickly look up the service history of our car and he let me know to bring it in and they would take care of it. I waited on the car in the customer lobby and the service did not take long at all. The entire process took about two hours — from dead battery, to waiting for roadside assistance, to the completed repair — which is pretty quick in my opinion. Jeff Allen has helped us with service on all 3 of our Volvo's and he truly delivers customer service - every time.

Before I left Mike asked me to come with him to look at a concern he noticed on my car.  He pointed out a ding on my car I had not noticed. Mike then told me he would have a repair company call me about the repair. I have taken my Volvos exclusively to Autoban for the past 25 years because of the exceptional quality of service.

Mitch in sales got me exactly what I was looking for.   He didn't try to sell me more than I asked for and provided extraordinary customer service. Absolutely no pressure to purchase.

484,"July 30, 2017","I reviewed Volvo, along with several other cars, on the Internet.  I wanted a sedan and had previously leased several Lexus sedans, all of which I was very satisfied with. However, the styling on the Volvo caught my eye, especially from the front view.  Since there was a $50 incentive for a test drive, I decided to check it out.

I was very pleased with the straight-forward factual and professional approach from your sales representative, Colten Thomas.  He made the process of evaluating the S90 with a test drive easy, and enjoyable...even let me take the demo home to show the Mrs. and return it the next day. I was so pleased with the car performance that not only did I return the car the next day, I bought it. 

I'm looking forward to learning more about all of the ""bells and whistles"" when I pick up the license plates from Colten.  No doubt, the car is vey well designed, but Colten was a big part of my decision to trust Autobahn with a safe vehicle for me and my family. ",4.7

I do like the convenience of having a loan car to access when need be.  I was told recently that I needed an engine filter replaced but it was going to be $140 I believe.  My husband is handy with cars so he looked up on youtube how to change it out.  It was super easy, would take less than 5 minutes.  We looked up the price at our local auto part store and it was only $35.  That is a huge savings to do this task ourselves.  Why would you charge 4 times that for something so quick and easy?  Just makes me more aware.  We will try to do the simple easy stuff and leave the hard stuff for your service dept. to do and maybe it will all even out in the wash.

645,"January 26, 2017","The car started making a loud screeching noise while driving. I contacted Mike Montez for help. I've had good experiences before with him. He helped arrange for a wrecker to come get the car and arranged for me to get a loaner. The noise was nothing major. I needed maintenance work done, and Mike took care of that for me. I could have taken the car elsewhere, but my experiences with mostly Mike, and Jeff also, will keep me coming back.",5.0

648,"January 22, 2017","In addition to taking care of our repair requests, the service advisor drove out to meet my wife and leave our vehicle with her. This saved us considerable time and allowed us to get our vehicle back several days sooner than we would have been able to pick it up. ",4.8
649,"January 19, 2017","I love the experience, I just don't like the Volvo XC60. It simply is not engineered for a low mileage driver.  Brand new car and the battery is dying because the alternator does not charge it with low mileage.",5.0

660,"June 29, 2014","I was looking for a front-wheel drive XC70 and found several on-line, mainly south of where we live. Dan DeFrank answered my initial inquiry as well as handled our entire ""out of state"" purchase. He was so very professional during the entire process and made the purchase a great experience. ",5.0
661,"March 04, 2014","We found an S60 online on the Autobahn website and called the Sales Person, Dan DeFrank.  He was very knowledgeable about the Volvo cars.  We agreed on a price.  We drove in from out of state, signed some papers and it was a done deal.  A few years later, we needed a step up in size, so Dan encouraged us to try the XC90, but that was too much for us, so we settled and really love the XC60.  The perfect size for what we needed and the price was right.  Both Volvo's (knock on wood) have never caused us any troubles.  Last summer we drove from Arkansas to Wyoming to Banff, CA, to South Dakota.  What a very relaxing trip it was, in the xc60.  ",4.4
662,"March 03, 2014","I'm now on my third Autobahn Volvo. I love everything about this dealership. In addition to the best prices in the country, the service department is outstanding and the service counselors are great to work with. But the real reason I keep going back is quite simply Dan DeFrank. In a business with rampant high pressure sales, Dan is a jewel. His tool is his ability to listen to my needs and then do whatever is necessary to make sure I'm happy. That he actually listens to me and cares about what is important to me is what sets him apart - head and shoulders above - any other car salesman on the planet. He is quiet and kind but knows more about cars...all cars...then anyone else I have ever known. As long as Dan DeFrank is part of the Autobahn family, I will be a customer for life!",5.0
