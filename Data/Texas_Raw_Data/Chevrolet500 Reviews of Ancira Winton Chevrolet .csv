0,"May 27, 2020",If i could give negative starts I would. This was the worst experiencesI have had buying a truck. Ancira has yet to fix problems they said they would do in writing. I would pay more money to buy else where then to deal with the used car corruption of Ancira.  They will not return emails or calls. My salesman totally blew me off. He was more interested in his commission then providing customer service and doing what he promised in writing. I will not even have my vehicle serviced by Ancira for fear of them screwing it up and not doing what they said they would do.,1.0
1,"May 11, 2020","I spent close to 3 hours here today trying to get a replacement for the lemon of a 2019 silverado they sold me.  I was willing to make some concessions, but didn't feel that I should have to pay much more, because it's not my fault that the A/C keeps going out (3 times, 4th time in the shop since Sept).  I told everyone I spoke to that I had a hard cap for my monthly payment.  They kept saying we'll get it there just get through financing.  I trusted them to make it happen.  So in finance I was $24 over my cap with an Intrest rate that I know for a fact I can beat on a truck I'm really not happy with and that's with me having to put $2k down. When I asked the finance manager about the intrest rate, he said he could shop it around. ????? Why didnt you do that during the 3 HOURS I was already there sitting in the waiting room. I told everyone my situation and that I was trying to get out of a xxx truck without going through the Lemon Law, but nope they were just trying to stick it to me one last time.   I walked.  Should have bought a Ford",1.0

3,"December 28, 2018","I agreed to pay Ancira Winton their asking price for a 2018 Suburban and drove over 240 miles to buy the vehicle. Told them I had a trade in and they sent me a range from a supposed ""3rd party independent appraiser"" paid for by them.  I told them their range was too low and they assured me that their on site appraisals were always higher if I brought my trade in to them.  So, I made an appointment to see them and drove over 240 miles from McAllen to meet them - I arrived on time.  They did not have anyone to see me when I got there.  The vehicle I was purchasing was also not at the dealership - it was at some Gun Club on display.  It took them about 45 minutes to go get it. 
Finally, the internet sales lady placed me with a ridiculous, condescending salesman named J Lopez who refused to acknowledge that a vehicle appraisal should take into account the luxury and 4 wheel drive packages on my trade in vehicle.  He kept insisting that the features on a vehicle don't matter.  When I asked him why they itemize these things on all their vehicle invoices and taut all the luxury features on a vehicle when trying to sell it he stated that they don't do that.  Hello!!!! Is that not the ultimate in Stupidity!  I was showing him the NADA appraisal and he said that they did not sell cars and that their appraisals where junk.  When I pointed out that NADA stood for ""National Automobile Dealers Association"" and that their dealership was a part of NADA he still remained in ""dense"" mode and claimed that they did not know what they were talking about.  When I told him that his offer was too low on my trade in he stated ""well why don't I just sell you my personal car for the NADA value - how would you like that!""  When I asked him why he was offering to sell his personal car to me he said because he wanted the NADA value.  At that point I determined that I would never buy a vehicle from Ancira Winton because anyone who would let their salesman act like J Lopez did was not worthy of my business or anyone else's business.  DO NOT BUY A VEHICLE FROM THIS DEALERSHIP.  THEY DON'T CARE ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!!",1.0
4,"November 14, 2018","The service department is the worst I have ever seen, George was my service advisor who I hardly heard from, there was almost no communication at all. The only way I could talk to him to check on the truck was holding for 20 minutes or being lied to about a call back, his manager Mr. Vetter was no different with the bad communication and a poor attitude especially when the bad service was brought to his attention. I was told to make an appointment so I did, just so the vehicle could sit for a week because their busy and backed up was the excuse I got from George. when a technician finally got to the truck he couldn't duplicate the problem, this truck almost didn't make it on a tow truck because the 11 month old Ancira transmission was failing. After wasting a lot of time the technician took the transmission apart and they definitely found a problem and instead of replacing the unit which is what I bought,a complete unit, they replaced a part and put it back together. So now that its done almost a month later,I have a transmission that has been patched up and the clock on the original warranty is still ticking. The fact that this was a warranty job makes me think feel like I didn't matter and they got my money already",1.0

6,"September 27, 2018",I purchased my 2017 Chevrolet Spark in 2016..  The salesman was great. Fast forward to 2018 and a little over 16k miles and the vehicle doesn't want to start.  Whether I become a repeat buyer depends on the service department.   My experience with the service department has been poor.  I've been asked how I turn the key to start the vehicle.  Great salesman but I would not recommend this dealership.,2.2

My needs were met and I could go back to work.  I'm happy. ",4.8
12,"September 06, 2018",My check engine light came on unexpectedly and mike was able to get me right in. He got me into a loaner vehicle right away while they checked my car. The next day mike had called and told me what the problem was and what they were going to do. He also told me everything was under warranty so I had nothing to worry about. Within 2 days my entire engine was replaced and ready to go. Mike even called a week later to check in on me. Very please with the customer service and outcome of the work done on my car.

22,"August 21, 2018","A pleasant experience from beginning to end.  Every member of your staff with whom we came in contact was friendly, helpful and knowledgeable.  I especially want to commend David Kronk.  His cheerful patience with this elderly couple was nothing short of outstanding.  He listened carefully to what we wanted, searched your stock ata number of locations  (we were not easy to please), and continued to show us vehicles until we finally made up our minds. He then made proper introductions to those with whom we need to deal to complete the purchase.  All in all it was a smooth seamless process. Kudos to Dave and all your capable folks who helped us. 
The fact that Dave is a cousin of my wife does not in any way deminish the validity of my comments. I have dealt with a fair number of car dealers in my 80 years, and I have to say that your dealership and it’s people are top notch.

29,"August 13, 2018","I scheduled an appointment the day before for a synthetic oil change and tire rotation.  Based on previous experience, I know that if I schedule an appointment with the Ancira-Winton Service Dept., they will take my Camaro to one of the service bays and begin the maintenance work within 10 minutes or less after I drop off my car.  There is no need to have someone pick you up and drop you off because unlike some other dealerships I have visited in the past, they do not give you a 2 1/2 or 3 hour window in which they will perform the work.  The service advisor, Michelle, was professional and courteous.",5.0
30,"August 13, 2018","As always, the Ancira Service Dept. did not disappoint.  This time I primarily dealt with Anthony Jetter, the Service Manager.  I came in with what I thought was a problem and Anthony had the mechanics go over my truck with a ""fine tooth comb"".  He was honest and upfront with me and saved me money as he debunked my problem.  Anthony, and Michelle both did a great job and kept me informed on the status of my truck while they had it..",4.8

61,"June 20, 2018","The reason for my negative review is because I took my 77 year old father to buy a new truck...during this time I was dealing with Natalie...she had given us a good price but than turned around and said the ""truck had sold"" however, he was never offered the other  available colors. 
My father believes that she messed up on the price and that is the reason he was not offer the additional colors.  This only proofs that they take the elderly for granted.  It is very sad because I believe it is true.  At that age they can buy any vehicle cash!!!   Please be advised that Natalie was friendly at the beginning.  She knew we were driving from FLORESVILLE TX.  Also, I believe Mr. Perez (I think that was his name) helped us briefly...he was willing to make a deal for my dad a lot better than Natalie.

I loved the car. John worked with me to get the car into my budget and did a wonderful job. I got a great car and I couldn't be happier.

86,"May 22, 2018",Warning I had my car serviced for a timing belt change. They changed the timing belt then a week later my a/c compressor went out. Thought nothing of it yet. Went to get my state inspection and learned my third brake light was out. I decided to change it my self to save money. Learned that the third brake light had diffrent types of screw . They are star screw a unique type holding the light in place. I brought the car new back in 2013 and car had never been in any other hands. Factory does not put mix matching screws. So Ancera service crew members must have swapped it out for a ebay sale. This makes me think they swapped my A/C Compressor when they changed my timing belt. So be careful thiefs work here. No one else has ever worked on the car since I bought it. ,2.8

89,"May 17, 2018","After purchasing a 2015 Cruze and being delighted with Ancira, my enthusiasm has waned a bit after purchasing a 2016 certified Cruze. The car just seems to have myriad problems that can't be replicated while being serviced. They did stand behind the vehicle, but it's just having to endure 5 hours of servicing just 3 months after purchase that's insulting. The Cruze has 16,000 miles on it, and if you're buying a Cruze, do know there is an inherent shifting problem with the 15s and 2016s. They shift Hard. They downshift Hard. When accelerating, they, at times, seem to miss, as they do upon take off from the stop position. After selling off the 2015, which afforded us many worry free road trips, I honestly feel I made a terrible decision in buying  a certified vehicle. ",4.6

My son and I have been on several road trips over 1,000 miles and up to 6,000 miles in the 15. Never a single problem. As a 59 yo, I can honestly say, the Cruze wants to go Fasssst. If without cruise control, you'll continually find yourself doing 80 in a 70 zone. So, I'm looking for a 15 with Low miles for my new car. I see one pop up on the website for my price, with Low Miles, a 16 LT with 12,000 miles. Wasted my time hitting up my bank, as Ancira got a better rate-From my Bank-which allowed me to jump into it. First time I've ever bought an auto without thoroughly having it checked out. (Certified).  But Hey, That's ANCIRA. I trust Ancira. Look for clues: The same faces when servicing vehicle, mechanics and inside. Same faces when it comes to Financial guys (Tony). It seems everyone has been at Ancira for 20 years or more. IF Anicira treats their family that well, they're going to treat their customers that well. Ancira is my go to.  BTW, the 16 Cruze has ample space for taller guys/gals.

Secondly, after I picked up my SUV on Friday, Saturday the ""engine light"" came on again which was the reason I took it in to begin with. Because the transmission had to be reopened once again this time it was at ""my expense"" to the tune of  $536.44 which I paid.  I feel the problem wasn't properly taken care of to begin with and they kept my vehicle for a week.

Lastly I just stopped by this pass Friday since I was in the vicinity to check on status of my SUV. The lady I think her name was Tracy, she does vehicle leasing was immediately by my door before I could turn the ignition off, and was very RUDE. She insinuated I smoked in the car, which I DID NOT! She gave me a warning. I did not like her accusations, or her tone of voice.  However, my service consultant John Ramos was outstanding, very professional.  One of a kind.

401,"January 31, 2015","Ancira Chevrolet and their bevy of peasant car salesmen are quite possibly the worst example of customer service I have dealt with. One Joe Cruz supposedly put a car on hold for me, corresponded with me the week leading up to my appointment, and waited until I drove from Austin and sat at his desk to tell me that the car had been sold. Piss poor business and piss poor service led to an experience that I would rate as piss poor. ",1.4
402,"June 06, 2014","I have been so disappointed in the service I have repeatedly received from Ancira Winton Service Department.  I have been taking my Chevy Cobolt there since I purchased it in 2006. There have been several recalls on this car.  From the very beginning (within 3 months of purchase) my Air-Bag light comes on especially when I hit a bump in the road.  I let the service department know this several times.  I have been told different reasons for this. The main reason I was told this happens is that the ""light"" is sensitive.  The first few years it wasn't on as much but the last few it is on all the time. They were never able to reproduce the problem when I left the car there. Within the last year I again let the service department know about the Air-Bag light . I was told that when the light comes on it means that there is a problem with the Bags and they will not deploy if I am in an accident.  This is very serious.  I was flabbergasted to say the least to find this out so many years after I repeatedly told them.  At this point I contacted General Motors to report this as it was happening since I bought the car.  They refused to fix the problem because Ancira Winton never once recorded me reporting it.  NOT ONCE!        This is not the first time that I have had problems with the service department.  I also had a Chevy Impala that needed work on it.  When I received the vehicle back the oil was leaking.  They apparently forgot to put a bolt back on it.  However, after the last debacle with the Air Bag I will never purchase another car from there nor will I take another car in for service.  I have another recall on my Cobolt. I plan to go out of town to have it repaired.  ",1.6
403,"June 11, 2013","I went by Ancira to purchase my new Silvarado and the salesman by the name of Joe Cruz was very helpful we were able to negotiate a final price and he was very helpful in explaining the whole process of purchasing my first ""new"" vehicle he bent over backwards to make sure we were comfortable with our purchase. I will recommend this dealership and salesman in the future to anyone I know! Great team at Ancira Chevrolet!!!",5.0
404,"June 05, 2013","I would not recommend this delar to anyone. They place a Ad in the Local San Antonio News Paper  for a Price on their new vehicles , once you visit the dealer on Bandera Ancira Winton, they only have used cars/Trucks with over 6,000 miles and claim they are NEW. If you have a vehicle trade they say they will pay off your vehicle, and after you have a final deal with all paperwork sign and complete the Sales Associate will harass you and State---  the Dealer refuses to  pay any vehicle trade off in full. As a new vehicle owner they promise to fill your tank with gas and give Free items for your vehicle , once the Deal is done , the end result is no items  are honored or gas. Other AUTO DEALERS are very competive and are Honset to the consumer. Ancira Winton  on Banderd and 410 in San Antonio is not a Honest and Trusted Dealer. BUYER BEWARE!!!

405,"March 21, 2013","Just wanted to let people and the dealership know that not only have I had positive experiences with the salesmen there, but also the Service Advisors. One in particular, Jorge De Los Santos. With the corvettes that I had and even family cars, and recently my new camaro, this gentleman has always treated me with the utmost respect and customer service. Even when some of the repairs have gone through warranty, he always has a positive attitude and treats me like a friend. Always keeps in touch and keeps me updated with the repairs or when the part, or tire in this case, will arrive. You always hear about reviews about the sales people, but hardly about the Service Advisors. Just though this gentleman needed some recognition. Great job Jorge and keep up the great work!............Sincerely Xavier Tellez.",5.0
406,"December 08, 2012","Could not wait for our survey to arrive so I wanted someone to know how awesome John Llamas and Stephen Skipper are!

These two are an awesome team. From sales to finance, these guys where on top of everything. They were more like friends than salesmen. It was a pleasure dealing with these 2 gentlemen and I wouuld recommend these guys hands down over anyone else there. They worked their butts off and got me the best deal for me and my wife. Because of these two guys, we will definately keep coming back to Ancira Chevy. Words alone can not express the gratitude we have for these guys and how happy we are when we buy cars from them. Keep up the great work guys and I hope that dealership knows what valueable assets you are to them. Thanks again guys! Top notch work!

408,"July 21, 2012","  My wife and I recently bought a new 2012 Silverado and the Sales Crew was great but when I went in for my first service it was a mess.  First I got put on hold for over 5 minutes and then transfered to some one in sales cell phone and then got a answering machine there. I call back twice and finally was told to bring it on in.  I got there at  2:15 and I asked if I could use the coupon that they had sent me for a tire rotation, and free car wash but they showed me that it had already expired but with my first oil change they would give me a car wash. I told them I had a appointment so I asked how long it would be and they replied about a hour or hour and a half. I told them I would go across the street and grab a bite to eat and left them my cell phone number so they could call when it was ready. Well I ate and came back and it still wasn't ready so I went in and asked and they said they would find out .. I went back in again and at 5:20 was told I could go to the cashier and pay out. The man I had dealt with came up and shook my hand to say thank you and I asked him why it had taken so long and he said they were swamped and I told him when I had come in and he said I thought you went to get something to eat and that it had been ready. I asked him why he hadn't called and he said he forgot.  I still had to wait awhile for my truck and when it got there it hadn't been washed either.  I was already late for a appointment so I left and I must say I wasn't very happy.  If this is the service I can expect to recieve on my truck I will probably find another chevy dealer to work with and also buy our next vehicle which we planned to buy in December (we intend to trade in our 2003 Suburban) Thank you  Don and Doris Zercher",2.4

He re-arranged his schedule to accommodate ours for a second meeting later that evening.  I asked him to make sure everything was ready when I returned with my daughter, (who the car was for).  He made sure the car was cleaned and sparkling for my daughter to see for the first time.  I wanted her to like it as much as I did!  When we showed up, everything was perfect.

425,"September 15, 2011","My husband is currently serving in the Military relocating back to Texas temporary. I moved back early with my kids and need a used vehicle back and forth to work and school. I received a purchase order from my financial institution. We are long time friends with Jerry Alvarado since high school. At this time of need we called Jerry Alvarado up to help us find a used good dependable vehicle. He had Felipe Mendez work with me. I had patience and was also looking elsewhere at the time, 2 weeks later he calls me up to see a 2005 Chev Malibu that just came in and test drove it for a day and had to return the vehicle with a rattling noise coming from the right passenger side and the door locks were opening and closing on there own. I immediately returned the vehicle and asked if he had anything else , I could of easily went elsewhere but that's how much trust I had in Jerry and he showed me a 2007 Mercury Milan. He let me take the vehicle for a couple of days, car ran good. They agreed to fix the door handle in the back and fix back window tint. We closed the contract and drove to corpus the next day and returning back the right rear bumper is hanging off. Immediately called Jerry and said to return vehicle the next day. Returned vehicle and explained what happened Jerry said they will fix it or return vehicle. Felipe asked I speak with Don , sales manager and speculated that I got into an accident or someone hit the vehicle. He was very rude and unprofessional. Very argumentative and wouldn't let me speak. There was a door dent on vehicle when I bought it right above the right tire and claims that door ding caused the bumper to fall off because its plastic and there was wind. Jerry Alvarado also agreed with him. They never disclosed Auto check. I had to ask for it and showed no accidents reported. I took the car to two collision shops and pointed out bumper was recently repaired and no bolts were found on bumper. Whom ever recently repaired bumper didn't put bolts back in . Salesman and sales managers are no experts in collision. There is NO accidental damage to this vehicle. The dent is simply a door ding that was there and now are refusing to take responsibility of the car because they have been paid $12,000 for this vehicle. Ancira is making excuses not fix it and are making speculations. I am so unhappy with this vehicle and the management. I will continue to fight for my rights and will hold Ancira responsible. The GM tried settling for us to pay $250.00 which is an insult to us. I will make sure to advertise in any way I can and will write certified letters. ",1.4

My family and I have purchased many, many vehicles from them in the last 20 year.
I went to purchase a BIGGER vehicle from Altima to a SUV and/or TRUCK.  The altima was just too small and we as a family were cramped.  Also, the Nissan had a light out for the headlight and was informed it would cost between $200 to $400 to get that fixed - you cannot just buy the bulb and replace - what a rip-off.  Glad to be back in a Chevrolet...
I went looking at USED GMC XL - test drove, spoke to Mike Mire who was referred to me by another salesman (he was too busy for me since I was late due to new baby to meet him, etc)
Anyhow, Mike said let me check on rebates, incentives and being a USAA member also helped with the down payment etc.
After talking to Mike I reminded him that I knew Jim from previous employment dealing with General Motors.  He said he was working the numbers and Jim would see what he could do.
Unfortunately our credit was lacking due to economy and husband being laid off and then I was laid off a few years ago.  But our getting back on track.
Mike called me back and stated Jim got approval for a NEW crew cab not USED.
My husband and I went to test-drive along with Baby to ensure it was what we needed for the family.  We loved the new truck, 2011 TEXAS edition Silverado.
Mike and Jim went above & beyond; exceeded our expectations.  I was so shocked with what they did.
They were great to work with.  Jim and Mike called when they said and also followed up with me to see how everything else.

He will also call us when a great buy is available.  I have a beautiful Mercedes SUV that I thought I didn't even know I needed but, Michael called me and asked me to come by to see it.

438,"May 23, 2011","1. The salesman hardly smiled and didn't seem very motivated - regardless, we got a nice 2003 Infiniti for a good price. We were informed to come back to pick up our free TV & contract, but we drove all the way out there to be told the TV's weren't available and our contract had been mailed. We live on the east side (converse), but Ancira's on the west.
2. The salesman agreed to get four-wheel alignment done and the belts replaced, but after verifying the job w/ our own Car X mechanic, we found out Ancira gave us the car back without doing the alignment and had proof to show it hadn't been done. We were told to drive over and the manager would cut us a check to reimburse us.  We drove all the way out there, but was then told to come the next morning.  We were also told the TV still wasn't there.  Thus we told them to mail the check.  This was the 3rd time driving out there.
3. Sephere's manager then called us and said the title had a lean on it (we traded in a truck).  I called him back and said my husband had already been out there three times to receive items and had been given the run around.  I then told the manager I'd ""mail"" the lean release document, but the manager insisted it be brought in that day.  I told him I don't think it's right to make us come all the way out there when we'd already been out there twice to pick up contract/check/TV that wasn't there, despite being told to drive out there and pick them up. My husband brought the documents the next day and was handed his purchase order, not his contract - so we still don't know what bank to pay our bill to nor do we have our reimbursement check for the maintenance we had to pay out of pocket because Ancira failed to keep their promise.
4. Two weeks later, my husband called Ancira expaining the problem and discussing the fact that it's near time to pay the first payment, but we've been given the run around.  He was directed to Sephere, the sales manager who was upset because my husband had previously called higher level managers to resolve the problem.  He was informed the reimbursement check hadn't been received because of the lien, despite the fact my husband had personally dropped the lien paperwork off. This would've been nice to know all the times my husband drove 1-hr round trips to get to the place. My husband then spoke to Toni, a manager there, who said he'd have a team meeting to discuss the problem.
5.  The funds/financing rep tried to lead us on by adding extra stuff in the price of the loan.  He initially stated the warranty items were already included in the purchase price of the loan, but when it came time to sign the contract, we caught that the final price was $2K more than we'd agreed.  When I asked him to break the cost out line by line, he then told us that each warranty item was added on to the purchase price of the vehicle.  

6. My husband and I purchase this vehicle and have been extremely disappointed by the service we recieved. We did, however, appreciate Ancira initially negotiating the price of the vehicle with us, but the service from the sales rep and the financing rep have been horrible.

It was a lengthy processes, but not because of anything that they were not doing themselves, but due to other difficulties with paperwork needed from the church.
They both worked hard at helping complete the deal and we are all thankful for their
work and patience.

Congregation is enjoying the van and are thankful to God and to our friends at
Ancira.

God Bless!

442,"May 17, 2011","We have purchased several vehicles from Ancira but our last used purchase wasn't so great. We weren't ready to give up on them yet, so we contacted Sales Manager Jerry Alvarado who when we purchased our 2009 Chevy Suburban was our salesman. We had such a great experience with him that when he referred us to Salesman Felipe Mendez we were confident he would take care of us and that he did!! Felipe listened to what we wanted, he wasn't pushy and answered all our questions. With his help we were able to find and buy our 2010 Chevy Malibu. There were a few issues with the car but Felipe guaranteed us he would take care of them. He kept his word and followed through surpassing our expections in more ways than one. He gave us the great experience we've come to expect from Ancira and a lot more. He stayed late, came in on his day off and even called us afterwards just to check that everything was ok. He really made us feel like VIP customers. Thanks to him we are still loyal customers and will continue to be for many years to come.   ",5.0
443,"May 10, 2011","Had a great experience buying our new Equinox.  I contacted Justin through the internet and then at the dealership.  Justin is very low key, not pushy or over-bearing.  He was interested in selling me what I wanted and not what he wanted to get rid of.  My wife thinks all car salespersons are sharks out to sell whatever they want with no regard for what the customer wants.  Justin is different.  He explained everything to my wife, answered all of her questions and was very helpful.  The car is great other than a issue with the driver side outside mirror which I feel Ancira will take care of.  I would highly recommend this dealer to anyone who is thinking about buying a chevrolet product.  From what I say and with my experience with them, all salespersonnel seem to be laid back and very low key.  No pushing, no you have to buy in the next five minutes or the price goes way up or we will not get another one like this one for another six months.  Truly a pleasant experience.",5.0
444,"May 05, 2011","Upon my arrival at this dealership I did not intend to walk out with a brand new vehicle. My experience with the salesman, John was oustanding. He took the time to go over the dealer incentives along with understanding the importance of my decision to purchase a new vehicle. Also, reveiwing the manifest list to verify if any additional savings would apply to me. I can't say that anyone else would have taken the time to review all the discounts with me. Overall, I would have to say my experience was pleasant and very ""at ease"". If in the market for a new vehicle, I would definitely recommend my family and friends to visit with John. The dealership was also very clean and friendly. Additionally, I would like to commend John on the great work he did by keeping in contact with me even after I purchased my new vehicle to make sure the vehicle was running great and my satisfaction with the vehicle meet my needs.

448,"March 30, 2011","I recently purchased a used 2010 Nissan Altima. As most people, I'm very skeptical of car salesmen. I have been avoiding walking into a carlot just for this same reason. I did not want to feel pressured or bombarded to purchase a vehicle.
 
However...

Jerry Alvarado (Sales Manager) and Jose Guzman (salesmen) went out of their way to make my experience wonderful. I did not feel pressured or taken advantage of. I would recommend Ancira along with Mr. Alavardo and Mr. Guzman to anyone looking to purchase a new or used vehicle. 

After picking out my car, the financing part went so smooth. My financing specialist MR. Esparza made me feel very comfortable about my payments and my options. He went over everything and was very patient with me gathering up all my documents at the last minute.

The follow up call i received the next day also made me feel my purchase was appreciated.

449,"March 22, 2011","I have no credit so after being at it for  2 weeks i finally went into Ancira winton chevy and was told to allow him to just try. So I did. After running my credit and everything else it turned up that all  I was able to get was a 2000 camry, which I didnt mind because my last car was a 2000.  So after getting thrown a million different requirements everytime one thing was done, I finally get the down payment and get the car.  Literally I drove the car right off the lot and the check engine light came on.  Ok, not a big deal.  It happens and sometime theres nothing actually wrong.  So a month later the car starts smoking, and I barely make it in to the service department.  Turns out the radiator needs to be replaced as well as the thermostat.  The radiator is covered but not the thermostat. Now im left to pay 190 dollars to fix this and get my car.  Why should I have a car for a month and already have to pay for repairs?  These people just bullshit you and make themselves feel all high and mighty as if they are helping out those who cant be helped but honestly, theyve helped make a bad situation worse.  So at this point Im just tired.  I want to just give it back to the dealership altogether because from the beginning I was not happy with their service.  But guess what...I cant.  I call the finance company and they tell me that basically I will most likely end up continuing to make payments on a car i dont have because if it does not sell for what i still owe, i am responsible for the balance. On top of that, it will show up as a repossesion.  Isnt it funny how the only reason I settled for this heap of shit to begin with, is to build my credit, but in the end it is going to damage what little credit I do have.  So one the phone with my finance company, i display my dissatifaction with this and what does she tell me...""You chose the car"". No i didnt but even if I had that is completely irrelevant because the car should not be breaking down after only a month. Ancira and Credit Acceptance.

I had to called onstar and requested a diagnostic on my vehicle but they could not find anything wrong with my vehicle but they did say if I didn't feel comfortable with my car they would connect me to ancira dealership. To try to make a long story short, I met up with Tommy in the service dept and from there he and Anthony took their time trying to figure out was wrong with my vehicle. After replacing some components underneath the vehicle and replacing my tires with new ones. We thought my vehicle was good to go. It turned out the new tires didn't make a difference so Anthony called me to to take a ride along in my vehicle and then a new one as well...what we both found was that new vehcile had the same noise that my 5-month old malibu had.

464,"September 17, 2010","My wife and I used USAA and other avenues to research new vehicles for a total of 4 months, it was narrowed down to two vehicles, the Exped. EL or the Suburban because the size of our family.  We first were directed by USAA to a Chevrolet dealer in Boerne TX, we mistakenly went to Ancira Chevrolet first, we scheduled an appt with an internet sales person. When we arrived we were greeted but because we had an appointment, we realized we were at the wrong dealership.  The salesperson helped us but because of my appointment, I felt obligated to go and we were directed by Ancira that the Chevy dealer was in Boerne and let me know that he will be there to help us buy a vehicle if we did not like the deal where we were going.  We ended up stopping at Freedom Chevrolet, by mistake again, and spent over an hours there, test drove the Suburban and loved it. We considered their deal but was not satisfied in the end. We never made it to Boerne due to poor time management on my part.  We then realized Suburbans we were looking for were limited and also went to Ford dealerships in the following weeks but was not comfortable with the deal and/or price of the Expedition EL's.  We searched on the internet throughout TX to as far as Bossier City, LA. We then realized w/pricing, interest rates offered and personal preferenes we decided to wait  but to still look but not as assertively. After a road trip a later in our 99 Ford Exped, we decided enough is enough with the limited space and our ever growing family in numbers and physically.  We then aggresively searched for any bigger vehicle to accomodate my family and I was told by a coworker to go back to Ancira.  We found a Suburban there with almost all the features on the internet that we were looking for sitting on the Ancira Chevrolet lot that was not there before; so I made an appt. It is a day we will never forget, my wife and I were greeted by Hector Ovalle about 45 seconds after our arrival to Ancira Chevrolet with the utmost professionality and sincerity.  We were there that day for almost 3 hours, talking not just about cars but life in general. The discussions were not only personable with a twist of professionality in helping us get the best deal but also all the benefits the vehicle would offer for us. We were in awe of the information because he helped us not only that day but also in future purchases, whether it is through them or not.  Hector's personality outshined his salesperson side and in a short time we realized talking to Hector was like talkin to an old friend we have not seen in years.  We could not turn down the great deal and especially the personable service that made my wife and I feel at home and erased all doubt that he wasnt just talking to us about a deal for him but for all of us. We got a 2010 Suburban and I have shared my experience with family, neighbors, co-workers, friends, especially the one who recommended me to them, which would be over 100 people in the two weeks after our purchase, they were in awe as well, not just about the deal but about our overall experience that is not shared by many when car buying experiences are shared with one another.

475,"March 01, 2010","Ok, First I will state MY faults. My faults are that we saw a vehicle we really really loved, and I think that because we loved that vehicle, they saw that in us and took advantage of us. I should of done EXTENSIVE research on dealer scams and procedures before I bought a car from any dealership. I would advise that from anyone as well. Ok, first the sales people. I was not off the truck and their already hawking you. Its just a bit uncomfortable for people to stare at you and not even out of your car yet. The salesman was VERY nice and was your best friend, but he answered all my questions and I don't think he deceived us so he was a ""pro"" and not a ""con"" The REAL reason for the bad review was the finance part. I asked ALL the questions i could and they just know how to do the signatures and pep talk so they can get your money for their commission. Much of the things that i didnt notice at the initial buying of the car, i noticed when i went back. I signed a contract that had the price of the loan i was going to get, THEN i signed the paperwork that i THOUGHT was included in the AMOUNT I SIGNED. sure enough going home thinking that what i signed was what i was going to see in my loan account was going to be the price i was going to pay. When i finally saw my account, it was almost 3 thousand dollars more. I called back and asked him WHY 3k more? He said that the one year warranty was an additional 2 thousand dollars. I told him ""you didnt tell me that!"" he said that everything is recorded in our camera and so on. He sounded so confident. I told him that he gave me three options. and if getting the vehicle with no warranty was an option then he did not provide me that option and that was not fair. after arguing he said that when i get my paperwork from the bank (which they did not give me ANYTHING when i left the first time, just a brochure and one document) to come back and fill out a form to cancel the warranty. then he said ""but we cant do anything about the GAP insurance."" I went back to cancel my warranty and they made me fill a form that looked like someone just made it up from microsoft word, and he told me just to sign it and hell take care of it. I was like year right and put todays date and told him to make me a copy. I can tell he was upset. I kept reading through the paperwork and read the GAP insurance part. it said the customer had a right to cancel or choose another provider withing 30 days of purchase. I told him that why did he charge me for the GAP and not ask me if i wanted it, he just slapped the amount to my loan. He said i cannot cancel it cuz of something about my car being destroyed blah blah. Then i showed him the contract and he was stumped. He called someone and he realized he was wrong. he said he was sorry and would take it off. I told him to take all the other OPTIONAL stuff and he said he could not because they were noncancellable. It was some health insurance, some tire insurance and some ID deterrent insurance. he said he could not do anything about it. After arguing for like 10 minutes about how he tried to take advantage of us, he made a comment about how ""ive been doing this for a living and i know what im doing"" yeah, your an expert and you dont even know what GAP insurance is. He walked into that one. I told him I was going to see his manager and he said ok and called him. Probably told him to prepare him of us. I could not believe that he was in it too. He said the same thing. He would fluff it and say that no this is not insurance its something else contract mumbo jumbo. i told him that this contract says that if someone breaks into my car because it has an alarm i would get compensated. THATS NOT INSURANCE? he knew he had messed up and was looking EVERYWHERE in the contract to get me not to cancel. After that i was already upset and told him that i came to buy a car not insurance policies. I told him i came to him because i dont want to jump heads. Well he changed his mind and said that he will call the companies to see if they can cancel the policies. Sure enough the next morning he called me and he said they cancelled everything. I kept doing research and found a guy that used to actually work there, in the service department and he said they tried to do the same thing. He said the price, tax, title and taxes is what you pay, ANYTHING ELSE is OPTIONAL and that is where they make their money/commission. No wonder they were pissed when i wanted to cancel. BEWARE of their scams. They might not do it to everyone so beware. Take care of your hard earn money. Dont go by the ""MONTHLY PAYMENT"" go by the actuall numbers. Ask them to make copies, ask names, ask is this optional, do i have to pay for this? Do research before you go and get your credit score before you go too. I reported them to the BBB and slowly but surely im getting my money back.  ",2.6

492,"December 17, 2009","Back in april of 2009 i was in search of a new car. i had an 2006 impala that i needed to turn in on the lease and i wanted to purchase a new ride. i went to ancira chevrolet due to the fact that it was the biggest chevy dealer i had seen in san antonio. when i visited the bandera/wurzbach location, i was greeted by the very friendly staff. I had worked with Jerry Alverado on a previous matter regarding my old impala. He directed me to a salesman nameed, Jose. Jose is a very cool, calm, and collected individual who excels in his area of expertise. He was very friendly, non-threatening, knowledgeable, honest, and flexible. He went up and beyond the call of duty to get me into a car. He really worked hard for me and made it possible to get me financed into a new ride. Jose is a straight-up person with straight-up answers. If he can't answer your question upon the initial asking, he will definitely do the research before giving you an answer and thats what i liked most about him. You can't go wrong with this dealership, the staff, and this salesman, Jose. :)",5.0
493,"December 16, 2009",I was impressed with the friendliness and professionalism shown by Jose Guzman.  He was interested in what my needs were and worked very hard to make sure my needs were met.

494,"December 16, 2009","I was extremely satisfied with the experience I had with Ancira Chevrolet. The salesman was really friendly and didn't try to push anything on me. I felt comfortable with my purchase and feel confident I got the best price I could get. The environment was family friendly. The other employees were courteous and offered my family refreshments. My salesman (Jerry Alvarado) was very knowledgeable and offered up answers for questions I couldn't get answers for at other dealerships. He just seemed like a normal guy. Not like a lot of the cut throat, I don't care about you I just want the sale, kind of salesman I've dealt with at some other dealerships. I think I would have paid a bit more for the kind of customer service I got at Ancira but I'm glad they didn't try to charge more! Believe me I did a good amount of price shopping before settling in with Ancira, they were the best price. I am DEFINITELY going back to see Jerry when it's time to get a new car. If you do find yourself at Ancira ask for Jerry by name but if you're walking around the lot he's kind of hard to miss. He's like 6'5. He'll take care of you!  ",5.0
495,"December 15, 2009","Jerry Alvarado was fantastic. Very friendly, knowledgeable and he was eager to help. I have referred a few friends to him after purchasing my vehicle. Before the purchase, I had student loans and had recently bought a house, so I was a little concerned that I was not going to be able to get into the vehicle at the right price. Jerry called me at work and told me to come pick up the vehicle and I was very pleased with the overall price. It was a great experience. ",5.0
496,"December 15, 2009","I had bought my previous Malibu from Ancira and have been extremely happy with the service department. So when I started getting ""new car fever"" I went back to Ancira early one morning just to look around.  Jerry Alvarado introduced himself and I explained what I wanted.  He was very helpful for the next few weeks, even when I changed my mind about what I wanted.    He knows his business and managed to assist me through what I have often found a painful ordeal in the past. I shopped around at two other dealerships because I wanted to make sure that I was getting the best deal.  I went with Ancira (and Jerry) because he was helpful, but never once ""pushy"".  When I am ready for my next car, I plan to work with him again. I think that the highest compliment that I can pay him (and Ancira) is that I have  recommended him to friends.
I am very happy with my new 2010 Malibu!",5.0

499,"December 15, 2009","I recently bought my second vehicle from Ancira Chevrolet, and I must say, my second experience has been something of none other.  And to be honest, I did not go to the dealership with the intentions of buying a vehicle that day. I went to “look”.  That was until Jerry Alvarado approached me.

Ancira’s dealership has always been very friendly and very helpful. My whole family has always bought from this Chevrolet dealership because of this. However, we have always dealt with different salesmen every time.  Not because one was better then the other. All have been nice and helpful, but forgettable.

However, all this has changed after working with Jerry Alvarado, I will never deal with or want to deal with another salesman ever. He was a true professional guiding me through the whole process the entire time.  I never felt pressured to buy and felt very comfortable dealing with Jerry. He was very cordial and welcoming.  He is very knowledgeable and confident about the vehicles he sales. I am confident that Jerry gave me good deal on my purchase as well as my trade in.  Jerry has since contacted me after my purchase just to ensure I left without any questions or concerns. 

I have since referred friends and more family to Ancira Chevrolet because the dealership as a whole, but most importantly to work only with and experience buying from Jerry.  He now has a customer for life.
