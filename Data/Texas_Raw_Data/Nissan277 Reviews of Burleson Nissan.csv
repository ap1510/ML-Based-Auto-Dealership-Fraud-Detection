7,"May 27, 2020","The first time I used this service was over 5 years ago and due to poor customer service I said I will not come back. I traded in my Armada and bought a Maxima Dec. 2019. When I brought the car in for my first service, I just knew I would receive terrible service and I dreaded it. Jason Vise was my advisor and he was so polite and helpful, it changed my mind about this service department. I have brought it in for oil changes, etc. and the different service people have all been so polite, helpful and really keep you updated on the progress of the work being done. Hats off to this service department.",5.0

9,"May 21, 2020","Although we purchased our Rouge Sport from Charlie Clark in Brownsville, TX; our move the Burleson, TX at the end of last summer left us looking for a reputable dealership for service.  We only had to make one stop.  Here, at Burelson Nissan.  Their entire team is ""on the ball"".  This is the kind of service department I'd be comfortable sending my daughters to (with their own vehicles, unaccompanied).  Honest, straightforward and accommodating are just a few of the accolades that are in the forefront of my mind.  This team does treat you like family.  Vic Mastronardi",5.0

22,"March 10, 2020","Michael made my first ever 'new car' exerience a great one! He made it seems very easy and simple, and was ready to answer any questions I had about the process. I visited a few other dealerships before coming to Burleson Nissan and ever one of them made me feel like I was wasting their time with all my questions and uncertainty. Michael walked me around the lot and made me feel very comfortable with my purchase. I'm definitely bringing my husband to him when he's ready to trade in his Dodger Ram for a Titan!",5.0
23,"March 06, 2020","I Purchased the only New car I've ever Owned from Burleson Nissan. They are the only Dealership that has ever Worked On or Serviced my car. The Oil Changes are Affordable and Brake Pad Replacements are Very Affordable too. I trust Burleson Nissan, because they only Use Nissan Parts and they Explain Everything, Before & After, that I Need to know. My 2013 Murano only has 60,000 Miles on it and Runs like a New Car. I Will Buy From Them Again.",5.0

37,"January 14, 2020","I took my car in for service for the first time. The entire experience was great. It started with the ability to make a service appointment online. The process was very easy - user friendly! I made the appointment with a little skepticism - assuming I would probably have to wait anyway. This was not the case. I arrived about 10 minutes early. I was greeted immediately. I explained why I was there. I needed an oil change and I wanted to find out what services were recommended for my Maxima at 75000 miles. I was escorted to the waiting area and offered coffee. The waiting area was very comfortable and clean. I waited about 20 minutes. The service advisor came in and explained that they had changed my oil. He also went through a list of everything else that was checked. I had anticipated needing to flush the transmission fluid. He told me how much that would cost. He also explained that the fuel injection system may need to be addressed in the future but there was not a ""911"" issue with it. I appreciate that there was no pressure to purchase services that I did not really need. The services done were exactly the services I had budgeted for on this visit. I felt like there was no ulterior motive to try to ""scare"" me into services that were not really needed and I greatly appreciate that. Overall, it was a great experience from scheduling to paying.",4.6

40,"December 29, 2019",Car is great trying to figure out how to work all the features work are get them to  the only problem was that was stated the car had 18 miles but had 276 miles,4.2
41,"December 26, 2019","12/24 I called to see if a truck listed on their site was still available. Was told that it was and when we arrived, it was available. Did the same thing with a Chevy Dealer the day before and they wanted to show everything but what they advertised.  Jesus was great at selling the truck. While we were looking, I had the service dept check the brakes on the Murano we bought last year. Not only did they checked the brakes but they gave us a clean bill of health on them and they cleaned and vacuumed the vehicle.  Made a deal on the truck and drove it home.  Nissan trucks are no frills, no doubt about it, but they are priced very well. I can update the infotainment system.  The only rock in my shoe had nothing to do with the dealership but one bell and whistle I didn't get was Automatic Headlights.  It has cruise and power windows but not that. So I'm bummed on that.  Maybe there's a solution?",5.0
42,"December 25, 2019","Always greeted and treated like family here. Have experienced very few problems with our two Nissans but those were handled by the service staff efficiently and as promised. Actually look forward to my oil changes :)

49,"November 21, 2019","  I purchased my Nissan rouge from this dealership and was very happy with my transaction. 
  When it came time for normal oil change and tire rotation I went back to have this service done. That time turned into a not happy experience. Service took way to long, and was done incorrectly resulting in an oil leak. I took vehicle back and the problem was corrected at no charge,  
  When service time came up again I went back and this was a much better experience. Job was done and they even put the filters that I had purchased in for no charge, set all the buttons that needed to be set  and no oil puddles! Good job guys. I will be back.",5.0

54,"November 13, 2019",Absolutely terrible and unprofessional customer service!  My vehicle sat at the dealership for two weeks and nothing was repaired.  They said they did not have the tool to fix it and I had to call an find out that the tool wouldn’t be in for four to six weeks!  DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH NISSAN OF BURLESON.,1.0
55,"November 02, 2019",I just purchased a new armada from Burleson Nissan and the process was beyond my expectations. Bobby went above and beyond and was very knowledgeable. I have purchased 11 new vehicles in the last 10 years and this is by far the best experience I have had personally. I appreciate the straight forward approach and no gimmicks. Thank you and I will be buying from Burleson Nissan again. Thank you for your honesty. ,5.0
56,"November 02, 2019",Was very pleased with the short time that with the replacement radio for my vehicle. But the radio was not ready for the average customer to use. The screen says it in factory mode. Eve iuiry time you have to touch the screen to see what what made it is on.,5.0
57,"October 25, 2019","Now to preface, I despise looking for a new car, as much as I despise moving or having a tooth pulled. My experience at Burleson Nissan went beyond my expectations. My sales consultant, Dennis, was extremely knowledgeable regarding all of the Nissan vehicles. Dennis truly exemplified great customer service, throughout the entire sales process. He even spent a great deal of time, explaining all of the features, as well as showing me how to use each item thoroughly, before leaving the dealership. His sales manager, George Holmes III, bent over backwards, to try and find any additional benefits and discounts, that enabled me to stay within my budget. The finance manager, Nabin Shahi, was able to get my pre approved apr, lowered significantly. Thank you all, for a remarkable buying experience!",5.0

59,"October 23, 2019","I wanted the factory-style Class III receiver hitch installed on our recently-purchased 2019 Pathfinder SL, and the service department did a first-class job on the installation. I needed to be sure that the wiring harness that was installed would ""communicate"" with my bluetooth-enabled Curt Echo brake controller. After the install was complete, there was no power to the brake controller because these units, in some vehicle applications, require a separate 12-volt power supply wire from the harness to the battery. Not sure if this was the case, but the technicians worked out the issue and now it works perfectly. I had offered to pay extra for the work that was really not part of the hitch installation but they did not want to charge extra.
Yet another reason I will continue my loyalty to Burleson Nissan, and everyone involved that made this process so easy for me. Thanks Jon Paul, Justin, Kyle, TJ, and the service technicians!",5.0
60,"October 21, 2019","We normally work through Jon Paul Wheat, but he was out of town and he set things up with TJ. TJ, with assistance from Kyle White and especially Justin, worked really hard to give us the best possible deal. Throughout the whole process, the guys were very courteous, friendly, and professional. This is why we've bought our last two vehicles from Burleson Nissan and we will continue to do so. Even though I already had financing arranged beforehand, Charlie Acosta in Finance was very friendly as always and did not pressure us to buy additional services/products. He did his job in presenting us with the opportunity to buy, but nothing more than that.  ",5.0

62,"October 07, 2019","I pre-selected 3 vehicles from their inventory and I called to schedule an appointment with Matthew del Campo who was referred by a friend.  He was waiting for me when I arrived.  We reviewed my selections and concerns.  We test drove one car, the dealership inspected my trade in.  He valued my time and did not waste it. He listened to my point of view and offered suggestions and considerations.  He introduced me to his team members and they too were respectful, courteous and kind. And that's why I purchased from Burleson Nissan.  The other 4 dealerships I tried to purchase from should know the reasons above are how they lost the sale.

Contact dealer for most current information"".  When the salesman mentioned a certification fee of $1695.00, I asked why was I being charged a fee when the website clearly says no additional fees.  I asked for a manager and I was then told I have to pay a certification fee but they could take off a few hundred dollars.  After going back and forth with three people, I was told they would reduce it to $600. I also told the salesman that I was from out of state so I would be paying taxes and tagging the car where I live.  The salesman put taxes on the sheet and told me they would take care of the taxes.  I was instructed by my bank to avoid paying taxes at the dealership because I would have to pay the taxes where I live.

Dario made a very distasteful job for me  ( of buying a car ) into a very pleasant experience.

Beware that when you are turned over to he financial manager that you will be seeing some extra charges that you might not have expected.  Buying Certified car will cost you about $ 1200.00 that I assumed was already in the price of the car.  Then the added warranty  packages  will cost you a lot more.  Some of these are very worthwhile if you plan of keeping the car for several years. You can plan on at least $ 4000.00 extra than what you planned..

132,"September 27, 2018","Be very careful of this dealership.   They will list prices low then will work towards getting the price back up by using very sketchy tactics. 

Here's how my experience so far went.   I see a car listed for a good deal so I call them.  A guy named Bryan answers.  The first thing they ask me is,  ""when can you come in to see the car?""  Red flag* whoa, slow down buddy?  I need to know about the car first too clarify what it actually is.   I'm from out of state,  mind you, I'd like to know as much as possible before traveling hundreds of miles.  I asked simple questions about the car and Bryan keeps telling me, he doesn't know anything and will find out about the car but kept asking me if i can come in.  I said not until i find out as much info as i can and get a finalized price. 

Fast forward 1 well later,  Bryan never calls back.   Suddenly I get a call from from a guy named Uriel Ramirez.  He asks me of I'm still interested in the vehicle.   I explained to him yes but Bryan NEVER bothered to call me back to answer all the questions I've asked about.   Uriel apologized and proceed to ask me what I needed to know.  After 1 question literally he cuts me off and ask me when can i come in?  This is history repeating itself again!   I tell him ill come in when i get more info and finalize on pricing.   He states he has to talk to his manager then quickly asks me of I'm going to buy cash or finance.  I asked why and he stated it's need by his manager.  I blatantly tell him i don't know but does it really matter?  Her then states he needs to talk to his manager and will call me back.   Proceeds to ask me when i can come in?  I tell him the fame exact thing!   He now tells me he'll cal me back and proceeds to never call back. 

based on this experience, it looks like they're only in it to get the idiotic customer who would go in and get price gouged.   The only reason i can think of why they're asking about cash or finance is they will use that as a bargaining tool since they will get a share for selling a loan.  This predatory type of practice needs to be exposed.  

If you can't even answer simple questions such as actual mileage or condition of the car,  then that tells you what type of business this is.

135,"September 20, 2018","I was recently unfortunate enough to have to purchase 3 vehicles in the last year due to two non fault accidents and another for my spouse.
Hands down this was the single most disappointing/learning experience in my history of auto purchasing. All Nissan Dealerships are NOT Created Equal. Good people make the difference!!! 

Not the case here my friends. I speak as a former Nissan Group Member.
Mind you I am in my late 40's and this is not my first rodeo. 

Yes it was a pre-owned less than 2 years with under 20k mileage asking around 19k for it. 
I will admit to viewing this vehicle online (always view in person during optimal lighting) and the photos appeared as if all was good but, once I arrived in person it was completely covered in bird waste.(Black Vehicle) 
NO longer Black...Why didn't they wash the car before my almost hour drive to the dealership?This is with a pre scheduled appointment set by the sales office for me to meet the Director and view this particular vehicle. Did not happen. 
Met with Jerry Peppers who at first was jovial and pleasant. This tone changed as the contingency list grew once the bird stuff was finally washed off and even though it was now evening I was finding more and more to add.
I actually left the dealership due to the list beginning to seem unobtainable and it was getting under my skin how the whole thing was materializing before me.

I received a call from Jerry frantic asking why I had left, I explained the contingency list was too large and I don't see him honoring everything in a reasonable timeframe. He basically lied and said he give me his word that all item would be honored. 

Ready to be done with the ordeal and move on after so much frustration I signed after all.
The next day I found more damage to the vehicle and guess who did not want to hear about it? 
Not Jerry, Not the Ron the Manager ,Not the Director who I left several professional voice mails addressing my concerns for the future of his dealership with its current mentality.
Never did I hear back from them after trying to schedule in for even One item on the original list. Number 1-""Buffing the Bird waste stains off""
Number 2-@ drivers window regulator not working properly

Once I finally reached Jerry he basically said to take my vehicle to another dealership to see if I can get the window covered under warranty. 

Guess what? I did and Now they get all my business because Lupe and Josh @ Jerrys in Weatherford  TX  Honored everything they left me in the dirt on.
I have since purchased another vehicle from Jerrys.

They said they would get to it as soon as possible. After about 45 mins they came in to try and upsell me on my air filters. I told them no and that I needed to get going so hurry up. They finally finished and charged me the $40, not $10. Now a month later I realize I’m missing my manuals, which you have to remove to pull the cabin filter so you can upsell it to the customer. So in short, they owe me a manual book for my 2015 Altima. Also, their phones ring for 5 minutes and automatically hang up on you. Great dealership 👎

217,"May 31, 2017","I decided to take advantage of this low offer that stated clearly filter and up to 5 quarts of premium oil and top off all fluids and a multipoint inspection to be done for $9.99.  I made the appt for 4:45 pm and got there early and waited for the service to be completed 1-1/2 later.  I was told that the wait should not be long plus if I liked I could have my car washed for free.  That sounded great and he stated that he would see about trying to get it washed after the oil change.  I really was not that worried about the car wash since it is very overcast and signs of rain coming so it really was not a big deal. 
Well I have been to numerous other dealerships for other vehicles in my past and everything they do it is printed on the receipt. I did not see the fluids topped or multi point inspection listed on the receipt.
 Well I noticed that this receipt looks pretty much confusing with all the itemized charges and bottom line I did not expect to pay more than what was on the coupon.  I say this because it I read and I understood that the filter was changed and only 5 qts were used in the change itself.  So, if I do the math correctly with tax the total should have been $10.81 cents...    The coupon does not state any additional fees incurred will be added for shop fee etc.  The coupon says that the $9.99 is the price I would pay if I stayed under the total of 5 qts...  It said nowhere on the coupon that I would get a discount of $10.00 after all the necessary fees and parts and labor have been tallied...  
To me this looks like a bait and switch and the customer comes out on the short end every time.  I keep getting these specials and invites to purchase vehicles there over and over but I don't see myself going there anymore or referring friends and family if this is the norm.  I have purchased 3 cars there already in the last 5 years between my wife and I and I feel that it will not take much to go somewhere else to continue future business.  I am not going to ask for any refund or consideration since I feel that the work done on my vehicle was done for much less than a quickie lube but at the same time the confusing coupons should not be allowed if your dealership is not going to adhere to the written letter on them.

Smiley kept changing the numbers and would not allow us to see them,   Delacruz told us that our finance company Capital One Auto finance wanted a $3000.00 Bank Fee from us before they would give us the loan, he kept telling us we had to pay they $3000.00 or else, finally my wife writes them a check for $3000.00 and after she hands it to them, the Salesman Delacruz comes back into the finance office and says to us, Well Capital One Auto now really only wants $1750.00 Bank Fee from you now, but would not give us back the check for $3000.00 so we could rewrite the check. We are going on 6 hours now, and finally started to sign paperwork, the dealership was getting ready to close down, Delacruz made sure he ripped off the price of the Vehicle on the sticker in the window before they put the paperwork in an envelope, we were whisked out the door with a Transmission going out on this vehicle, and broken windshield in the line of our vision to be told they would replace it next week (this vehicle should have never left with the windshield in this condition) very dangerous to see out of, we have to drive in the dark in the country!  We get back home and see that the numbers of the price of the vehicle had been changed to $15,939.44 not the original purchase price of $13,140.00.  Monday morning we tried calling the dealership, the salesman Delacruz would not answer our calls, we left messages, and tried to call the Smiley in the finance dept, no answers no return calls, we even tried calling the Manager of the dealership Justin Crane, we were told he was out of town for the week and call back the following week, which we did call numerous times and we left multiple voicemail's with NO return calls the persons answering the phones came to recognize our voices when we called we even left messages for the Female finance lady to call us back NO ONE at Nissan of Burleson ever returned one phone call to us!   They have committed FRAUD and deceptive trade practices against us and Capital One Auto Finance which are now involved with this situation, Capital One Auto Finance said they NEVER ask for a dime from any customer they write a loan from, that Nissan of Burleson lied to us and Cap One Auto is very mad that Nissan lied on their name to pull such a shady deal on us!     If Nissan of Burleson doesn't want to right their wrong, then we will be suing them, along with Capital One Auto Finance and Nissan will be Blacklisted with Cap One Auto Finance and will never get another customer financed through them, it's quite a legal team they have working on this situation!

Ok, no problem, so i go over there to see this vehicle. The place is a ghost town, i walk in with my daughter and there is only the front desk girl (who appears to be packing up to leave) She clearly sees us walk in, but not even a ""welcome to Nissan, etc"" - ok, i can live without the welcome. So i go over and meet a salesman and tell him i want to see a specific vehicle and have a trade, that i called and they said to talk to bla,bla,bla. So we go see it and he appears to not know anything, or much about the vehicle, doesnt talk alot, but its clear to me, EVERYONE appears to be more concerned about going home, than earning my business. The sales person takes me to see the vehicle i am interested in and ready to buy, I was even going to pay the asking price. So after the test drive, they offer me $2000 less for my trade than 2 other dealers. I tell them i cannot accept that and if they could match the other dealers trade in offers - they basically say ""No, ok, and bye"". 

The next day, i get a call from a sales person asking if i went in, and if i was still interested in the SUV. I basically told them ""NO"" i am not interested in doing business with them, nor like the way i was treated, nor will ever buy anything from them."" Its been 2 days later, and sales persons are still calling me to see if I am interested in the SUV.  
Everyone knows, the pressure one experiences, and the time it takes to going to a dealer and looking at vehicles. Everyone has different experiences with different sales persons and sales managers. Some are positive and some are not so positive, like mine. I feel since myself and daughter were the only ones in the dealership, besides the sales person and the guy sitting in the box. He could have just came over and talked to me personally, offered some alternatives, instead of the typical lone salesman going back and forth and wasting time by making us wait for at least 30 mins at a time. 

Perhaps i didn't appear ready to buy, or I appeared to be a high credit risk, or wasn't in my Sunday best clothes, or maybe because i knew more about the SUV than they did, but i was stereotyped and made to feel ""lets get this over with cause your'e not gonna buy anyway."" Doesn't matter, this dealer was not doing me any favors, I wasn't asking for anything free, i was interested in seeing and buying an SUV - they were more interested in making assumptions.They didnt care.

Just know people - don't feel pressured to buy from any dealer, if you are not comfortable with a sales person - ask for someone else, if you dont feel you are getting the attention you feel you deserve - youre probably right and it's ok to leave. If you don't like the way you are being treated - especially when looking, then its not gonna be any better during or after the sale. 

Bottom line is, i am not disgruntled and writing this review as revenge. I am simply offering my experience at this dealership on a particular night. There are many dealers who treat buyers like this, and maybe its not the dealer, maybe its the salesperson or sales manager. But whether i am interested in buying a $10,000 car or $100,000 car - it doesn't matter, a customer should be treated with respect and patience, whether they arrive at 9am or just before closing time. This is why you have hours of operation - 9am - 9pm. Another thing is instead of your salespersons sitting in their little cubes, they should be out on the lot learning about the vehicles they are selling. Have your sales managers leave the comfort of their box throne and come meet customers.

PS. That night while still in the NISSAN parking lot, i got a call from the other dealer sales manager asking me how it was going, did i make it ok, should they wait for me to come back that night, etc. I told them where I was at and that i would buy the SUV from them after all and I would be back the next morning. The next afternoon, I went back and bought the SUV from them.

231,"December 28, 2016","This dealership has been responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of my 2010 Nissan Pathfinder SE 4x2. Although I only mention Nick Oliver as my service department rep, I have dealt with two other representatives that were just as customer oriented as Nick was. This department was responsible for keeping my vehicle operational for the past two years. 


The members of their sales staff here are pretty good people to deal with. My sales person that I had an interaction was Nikole.  Nikole is one of the friendliest sales people that I have dealt with.  Our initial interaction was when I wanted to test drive the new 2016 Nissan Maxima when it was available 6 months ago. She patiently showed me and accompanied me to test drive different trim levels for the Maxima. Throughout this process, she was nothing but pleasant and patient. As my urgency stepped up to purchase a new vehicle, she was the one I repeatedly dealt with in regards to the Nissan Armada within the past 3 months. I test drove all three trims of 2017 Nissan Armada and she answered all of my questions about the vehicle.  

Today I notified her that I was not going to be able to purchase that vehicle from her and I had to go a different direction and purchase a different vehicle that was within my budget. She was very pleasant over the phone and should my purchasing path lead me back to a Nissan, she is the person that I am going to deal with. For her professionalism along with Nick ( service department rep ), I would highly recommend this place in regards to the purchase/maintenance of a vehicle manufactured by Nissan.",5.0

246,"June 02, 2016","I recently visited Burleson Nissan only to experience 3 hours of excruciating pain. I went in to buy a used Honda Civic Hybrid. The price is listed at 13,885, and I was very firm about my trade in price for my car. After inspecting the vehicle it was clear there was hail damage on the weather stripped and most likely on the rest of the car but it was repaired. After inquiring, it turns out the car was severly damaged but repaired with no insurance process so it doesn't show up on the carfax. After pressing several times the sale person finally told me that yes there was hail damage. This didn't necessarily bother me, what bothered me was that the salesman also included an $895.00 warranty on top of the original $13,885.00. My experience has always been that extended warranties are optional, according to this salesman it was. Towards the end of negotiation it became not optional and I was told I had to get it. This salesman basically said anything to try to make the sale and would not let me leave, he was basically holding me hostage with my keys and kept changing the subject and arguing about why my car isn't worth what they were giving me and how great of a deal I'm getting. All in all, this was one of my worst experiences yet at a dealership and after two-three hours and fifteen trips back to the manager I finally left empty handed due to the extended warranty.",2.2
247,"May 31, 2016","Seller lied about service work: dealer said they had performed recall.  Carfax showed otherwise.  I asked Bill and was told it had been done.  It had not.  We read up later and learned they're selling a car with a fatality-causing defect.

The manufacturer (Honda) *ordered* all dealers to stop selling those (defective) cars.  But Burleson Nissan will still sell you one - and they'll tell you it's fixed.  

The airbags in certain vehicles work like shotgun shells, apparently, and have killed people and maimed many more.  See the web and NHTSA) for more about it.

Stay away.

On top of that, it was everything you've been warned about with used car salesmen.  We had an appointment (via the number they give out for this dealership) with Thomas McCarthy, but he wasn't there when we arrived, and it appeared he had already left.  We talked to Bill, but he was a jerk, particularly to my wife.  Of all the car salesman I've ever interacted with, he has been, by far, the worst, and least helpful.  He also used pushy sales tactics trying to sell us the car (before we even knew about the critical defect).  

Go elsewhere.  Run.  Take your business to an honest dealer - there are plenty of them out there.  

(Auto Market Direct in Addison, for example.  Or Texoma Classic in Texoma.  Reliable Chevy in Richardson.  Many dealers won't sell you defective cars, or lie about it -- go see one of them.)  ",1.2

253,"September 20, 2014","My husband and I had been to several dealerships looking for another vehicle.  As we all know, shopping for a new vehicle and gathering information is  a tiring experience.  Never having looked at the newer Nissans we drove to the Burleson Nissan dealer to see what they had that I might like.  Having had both my knees replaced, getting in and out of an auto is important for me.  I saw the Nissan Quest and wasn't  impressed with the body style but I decided to look on the inside.  I was totally surprised with the beauty of the interior as well as the many features like13 speakers and the Bose system.  I wasn't considering the purchase of a van, and the new body styles, for me anyway, take some getting used to.  One of the main attractions was the fact that there was no step bar necessary to get into the van, just lift up my leg and get in.  I have been driving in higher vehicles for 15 years.  Our salesman was Don Seago, a very patient man who answered all our questions, listened well, and applied no sales pressure.   We met with Don at one in the afternoon and by the time we looked at what they had on the lot that might meet our needs, talked, went through all the aspects of the sale it was nine thirty at night when we got the keys and he explained  the functions of the van.  We found  Don to be a very personable man.  We drove off the lot in the dark of the night and had to pull over on the shoulder of the road  because  my husband had the car in the wrong gear, we got a phone call and it was Don asking if it was us sitting on the side of the road and if he could come back and help us.  I would say he went the second mile.  All the staff at the dealership were kind, friendly, and there was a good atmosphere .  Follow up was as good as before the sale.  Love our van.
