0,"April 08, 2019",Went in for window not working they fixed it I got it back then both stopped working 3 days later and the transmission started slipping . They quoted me 7200 for new transmission or 4300 for used with 90 day warranty.  Prior to that the told me I need new control arms little did they know those were are replaced. Tey have had my car now for 3 weeks for a simple window switch. They are slow they try to over charge you and charge you for things you dont need. My door panel was off for them and the switch in the floor board. ,1.0

Liz Roop was very professional and knowledgeable made my experience enjoyable for once in buying a new car.  I would recommend them to family and friends.,5.0
4,"October 14, 2017","Sames Bastrop, Same ole cons. They help themselves to your Ford incentives. They offer to fly you in and everything! That's great isn't it, once you get to the finance circus tent you have no ride home, better sign on this line, so what its only a few bucks just sign! Do your research and come in prepared. They promise your they are different, but they arn't. The only scam I can say they dont partake in is the dealer sticker scam (Tint, Wheel Locks, Nitrogen, other junk).

If you are going to do business with these people, ensure you have a buyers order before you head into the office. This is how they got me even though I asked for it multiple times, that should have been the biggest red flag. Well they didnt 'get' me for anything other than my time.

5,"September 26, 2017","My recent experience purchasing a vehicle at Sames was great! Shawn was very helpful, professional, and understood what I was looking for in my new purchase. The whole experience involved no pressure, and I walked out, with the keys to a new truck, knowing they tried their best to give me the best deal possible. If you're in the market for a new vehicle, don't hesitate to give Sames Bastrop Ford a call! Ask for Shawn in sales, and he'll take care of you!

Thank you, Sames Bastrop Ford and Shawn!üëçüèª",5.0

13,"April 17, 2017","It was a simple issue...replace the handle for the hood release.  Should not have taken two weekends to get that done.  However, the first weekend, the new handle could not be located.  Seriously?  

The service guy, however, that helped me, had a great personality and good interaction.  ",3.8
14,"April 05, 2017","This dealership sucks. I bought a used f350 from them 110 days ago for close to $30k . they told me it had new michielin tires all the way around . well they may have looked new but the back four dual tires were dry rotted. At 88 days from purchase and less than 3k miles on them the inside tire on pass side blew the side wall conpletly out for no reason.. A week later which was 93rd day from purchase i was driving 65 on hwy and inside dual on drivers side rear came apart and knocked half of my fender off.. I called my sales woman Liz. She told me that they wouldn't do anything about it bcuz it was over 90 days and I needed to be like every other person in the world and go buy some tires and hung up.. Then I called back a week later and talked to a sales person who told me he would have a manager call me back about this issue. No1,called back. I called again and demanded to talk to a manager. New car sales manager got on the phone and said they weren't gonna do anything if I didn't stop writing bad reviews about dealership and he would have someone call me back.. Its been a week and still no return call about my problem w truck. I wouldn't ever recommend this place to anyone because they won't take care of their customers after they get your money.  I've never felt so cheated or disrespected in my life the way I do by sames ford bastrop Tx.  I'll never buy from them again. I'll just go back to driving a RAM.",1.0

17,"January 11, 2013","if your looking for a service shop that has employees that are know it all's, and tell what they THINK about your concern then this is the place for you, recently i took my car to Monday Ford for a concern of a heavy vibration. David the service writer came and looked at the car and with out test driving, or having a technician look at the suspension, David diagnosed the problem and told me that i needed tires and an alignment, that my alignment was the cause of my heavy vibration, now i am not a auto tech but that sounds like a bunch of nonsense. not satisfied with the diagnosis of my concern i took my car down the road to another shop and the technician there finds a really bad wheel bearing.I took my car to the dealer to receive excellent service and i was disappointed. For bad service come to Monday Ford and ask for david.",1.0
18,"December 31, 2012","My Daughter recently bought a 2013 Mustang GT from Munday Ford and she raved about what a good deal she got. The salesmen she dealt with was outstanding, very knowledgeable. She said the General Manager, Craig Murphy, also made her feel ""welcomed"". Because of this buying experiance she said she highly recommends buying a Ford from Munday Ford.",5.0
19,"November 27, 2012","Hello, 

I recently purchased a pre-owned vehicle from Munday Ford in Bastrop Texas, although the vehicle itself came from Munday Chevrolet in Elgin. Originally I test drove the vehicle around the block one evening, and it seemed like a good fit. Upon driving home to New Braunfels I noticed the hood seemed to vibrate, but I wasn‚Äôt sure because it was dark. The next morning I went out to do a closer inspection, and noticed the hood was misaligned. I called the dealership, because I purchased an extended warranty under the extended warranty provider. The finance manager did the up sell, and told me it was a bumper to bumper warranty up to 75,000 miles. This initially gave me peace of mind, and they while reluctant did correct the hood misalignment. The repair took three or four days to complete, and I started having some concerns. Upon getting it up to highway speeds I noticed a lot of airflow through the front doors, in addition to leaks on each side when it rained. 

I didn‚Äôt want to take the vehicle all the way back to Bastrop, and asked if my warranty could be used at the local Dodge dealership. Munday Ford informed me I could take it to them, and so I did. Upon delivering the vehicle to Bluebonnet I was informed that the vehicle had been in some kind of collision. I immediately went to check my carfax again, and ran an Auto check as well. Both reports came back with a clean record, and now I was under the impression that the dealers did multi point inspections, in which surely this would have been noticed. I have attempted to contact Mr. Craig Murphy, and have received no response to date, and after our disagreement over the grill and hood I expected he would behave in this unprofessional disrespectful manner. 

I‚Äôm at a loss of what to do, and would strongly encourage people to have the used cars at any Munday dealership independently inspected, as they will not ‚Äúmake it right‚Äù or even attempt to. The behavior received is that of a typical car salesman, and I hope people can take heed and think twice before purchasing a new or used car from such a dealership. It appears now that the bumper to bumper warranty I was up sold is not valid, and no dealership will do the work. I have attached the report to my Facebook page, and will continue to inform the public of this dealers practices. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs right to sell a wrecked vehicle, and after your made aware of it there should be attempts to make it right.

20,"November 10, 2012","Negative review is on service department, not sales.

Purchased a new truck from them, had a good experience/deal.

Took truck in for first oil change (free, but they insisted I bring it back to the dealership).  Noticed the smell of burned oil while driving and checked, sure enough the ""mechanic"" did not replace the oil cap but left it sitting on top of the battery.  Called the next day to talk with service manager.  Constantly put on hold and told he was on the other line.  Finally left a message on his voicemail describing incident and asked him to call back to discuss.  48 hours later never heard from him.

Bottom line: decent place to purchase a vehicle but do not take it there for any service, no matter how simple.",2.0

23,"February 22, 2012","I contacted this dealership through their Internet Sales Department.  I wanted to get information from them on two vehicles to see if they were still available, and to find out who to talk to when I went there the following night. All I received were automated responses. The other dealership in town I contacted responded not only via personal email, but called me as well.   Needless to say I was not impressed.  I did not even go to the dealership to look at the vehicles. And I DID BUY from the other dealership.  They lost a sale!",1.3
24,"October 30, 2011","I purchased my new 2012 Ford Explorer at Munday Ford in Bastrop, and I love it. I traded in my Armada and got a good trade value, and they brought in an Explorer just like what I wanted. This was a great experience for me and my family. I liked the time they took with me at the dealership I didn't feel rushed like I did when I went to the big dealerships in Austin.  If you are looking for a Ford it is worth the time to give them a call or swing by.  ",5.0
25,"August 07, 2011","The only reason I bought this 2011 F150 is due to the fact that Munday Ford butchered the repairs on my vehicle.  The repairs that were done were substandard and not up to Ford specs.  I will never visit this dealership again, and because of this visit, I am considering trading both of my trucks in for a different brand.  Ford's customer service is no longer #1 in my book",1.0
