I would send any one there if they were looking to purchase a vehicle. I would like to give Mr. Robinson a 10**********, SHOUT OUT and a Thank you very much!  Mr. Robinson was welcoming, informative and very knowledgeable about the vehicles. He went above and beyond my expectations in managing my purchase. Mr. Robinson went so far as to follow me home to pick up additional paper work needed to complete my purchase, so I didn't  have to go home and come back. When I  finished my purchase he programed my vehicle so I had hands free driving without me asking, gave lots of information I wouldn't have thought to ask. When I left I was extremely satisfied and had a great experience.  He followed up to be sure all was well. If you want a great experience go to Central Houston Cadillac!!!!",5.0
1,"April 12, 2020","Many Thanks to Cesar Rojas, he gave me Top of the Line First Class treatment from minute 1 and the entire time. Cesar's professionalism, kindness, knowledge and No pressure sales tactics made me feel great and comfortable about my investment. Central Cadillac staff greeted and welcomed me like Family. Looking forward to catching up Cesar when I purchase my next Cadillac.",5.0

3,"October 11, 2019","I completely agree with Service Department ""Archetek's April 29, 2019 review.  On 6/17/19, my low mileage 2004 SRX 4.6L NorthStar engine was brought into to Central Houston Cadillac for diagnostic and repairs relating to the infamous Cadillac faulty NORTHSTAR engine oil leaks, and Central advised that the repair was completed on 6/18/19. Central Cadillac's John Bishop was furnished with all documents regarding all 2019 prior mechanical work so that they could thoroughly assess the issues.  A service representative who was knowledgeable about the NorthStar engine was specifically requested, as the first service representative presented had no knowledge whatsoever of a NorthStar engine.  Thereafter, we were introduced to Central's ""John Bishop.""  Mr. Bishop indicated that he would have his most knowledgeable mechanic make a diagnostic test and render an opinion.  Cut to the chase, the repair work that Central charged in excess of $1,000.00 did not repair the oil leak and Bishop was advised, the car was returned to Central and sat there for 2 weeks without any communication whatsoever.  Additionally, the clean brown paper roll that had been placed under the SRX after Central's initial repair was brought in as evidence of the continuing oil leaks.  Bishop took a picture of it and destroyed the brown paper.  After 2 weeks, I demanded my car be returned and that I be reimbursed for incomplete repair.  Central's Service Manager, ANDY TIWARI, then proceeded to write the credit card company with falsehoods, the likes of which I am able to refute and substantiate with documentation, and to state that he had pulled ""GM official records"" as if GM was the only professional mechanic that has maintained this vehicle through the years.  For those who are unaware, to simply replace a indicator light on this vehicle, Cadillac dealerships charge $200.00 because they designed the vehicle so that access  to the light was not readily accessible.  I have had many indicator lights replaced on this vehicle for 1/4 of the GM amount.  Also, GM would not have recent records of other work as the work was not accomplished by GM, albeit all 2019 work records were furnished to Mr. Bishop.  Calls were placed to Mr. TIWARI (Bishop took the message) and Kelly Stewart, General Manager.    No calls were returned.  The ""requested services"" as Mr. TIWARI wrote to credit card company, were NOT FIXED and his ignorance as to the related facts are displayed in his written correspondence.  He even implied that if the credit card company revoked the charges, he would place a mechanic's lien on the vehicle.  Well it appears that Central Houston Cadillac needs to have a ""LEAN"" (no pun intended) placed on them and understand that recourse does favor this customer.",1.0
4,"July 24, 2019","I purchased “new” demo Cadillac XT5 from Central June 2018. The car had less than 8,000 miles and was listed as a new demo. Upon purchasing the car we repeatedly asked for the carfax. TheyManager and salesman both kept Day your buy a pretty much “new” car, the carfax is clean. We still continued to ask for it. They promised when they did all the paperwork they would give it to us. That never happened. After arriving home we realized they never printed it. After being in touch with the salesman he promised he would email it to me. Again that never happened. Fast forward to May 2019. We try to trade in this car and find out from the dealership we’re are trying to trade with, there’s a damage report on the carfax. So here we are with a car that we paid a new price for that had been damaged in December 2017 while the dealership owned it. Now we can not get our money for the car. After I began trying contacting the dealership.... When talking to their managers, they forward me to different Salesmen. They kept insisting for us to make the trip back to Houston without telling us any information on what they can do for us. The bad thing is one of the managers is who completed all the paperwork when I was purchasing the car and was also the one who kept telling me the car was new and the carfax was spotless. I filled several complaints with different organizations. The first one being the BBB. They replied with us needing to bring the car in for inspection. So we did. When we arrived we were told they would put us in front of the right people (never saw anyone but another salesman). They asked from my keys and told us it would be around 30 minutes for so from them to complete the inspection. I told them I may consider trading vehicles with them if they would make the situation right. So while we waited on the inspection we looked through their lot online. We informed them that we would only consider trading once we knew what they would offer me for my vehicle. They shot us some low ball offer under KBB value that was nothing more than what I would have received from a local dealership with the damaged carfax report. We decided we were wasting our time so we ask to speak to the GM. Of course, he was out of town but would call me by the following Monday. Needless to say, here we are a month later no call. The GM won't answer our calls and the others say theirs nothing better they can do. Their last response on BBB was I decided to not have my car inspected and decided to trade it in. Obviously, that was false. My car never moved the parking spot the entire time we were there, the reason we went was so they could inspect the car. All I said was I might consider trading it in if they could make the situation right. Who would trust them?",1.0
5,"May 22, 2019",Price changed when the paperwork was done. Was told $2800 was normal for dealer prep fees and when I said I’m not paying it I was told the price of the car was wrong. All of this was done over text on Miguel’s personal cell. He didn’t have the guts to call and have the conversation. He even sent a photo of the paperwork via text. STAY AWAY!!!,1.0
6,"April 23, 2019",Do not waste your time bringing your vehicle to this location. I highly recommend you take your car somewhere else. I schedule an appointment on the phone with a agent ahead of time and explain exactly what services I need it from them. Once I brought my car in later that week no one came out to greet me. And I stood there for about 10 or 15 minutes before walking inside asking if someone could help me. TheAdvisor I spoke with could not find my name anywhere in their system. I ended up having to wait an hour for them to find a loaner and it was not equivalent to my Escalade. And I was told for future appointments I need to schedule ahead of time so that I may get a vehicle equivalent to mine. Which I did that. Secondly after three or four days went by I had not heard anything from the advisor. I had been calling him repeatedly leaving messages and he never responded to any of my calls. I decided to just go there to find out what was going on and come to find out my truck still was not fixed. it was sitting in the little storage area. So I asked for them to just give me my car and I took it to a different dealership and got it serviced in a couple of hours. I would never ever bring my car to this dealership. It's horrible.,1.4
7,"February 15, 2019","This has to be the worst dealer experience I've ever had !! This dealer cares more about the mighty dollar than taking care of a customer , they will quickly kick you to the curb for a few extra bucks , doesn't matter if you had already agreed to a deal ! Never again will I ever deal with this group again and I suggest you do the same !!",1.0

9,"December 06, 2018","I purchase a car 3 weeks ago they make every posible promise (Sales person: Akash) to close the sale. 2 days after OnStar was not honored, for 3 weeks I’ve been trying to get a manager to solve the problem with no resolution. Last news they fired the sales manager. Advice, stay away from this place.",1.8
10,"November 21, 2018","As of November 16,2016 this is what my car look like after dropping it off for an OIL CHANGE and other CONCERNS!! The advisor let me know that they were behind so I would not get my car right back , he also informed me they had to do a 3 point inspection. A week or so later I received a call addressing my concerns, he informed me that the extended warranty company would not cover the issues with my car as usual so I agreed to pay for the oil change, service air bag alert. More time went by I began to wonder when I’m going to get my car. I called the dealership for two days (Tuesday-Wednesday) trying to speak with my advisor. My calls were being transferred to voicemail nor were they ever returned.. Finally on Thursday tried calling again letting the advisor know I was ready to pick up my car. He asked why and was something wrong with loaner? I assured him everything was fine that I was just ready for my car. He told me my car was not ready that they were working on one of my concerns that the extended warranty company never agreed to pay for nor did I. So I was told he would call as soon as my car was ready but it shouldn’t be much longer...  On November 5th I received a call from the advisor about my car.. He stated that he had bad news.. The first thing came to mind is that they found something wrong with the car. The advisor stated that the technician had an accident over the weekend Saturday (November 3) in my car during a test drive. With that being the only information that was given, I later found out it was all a lie!!!   My car was not in a accident over the weekend, it was on November 1st!   The technician was 5 blocks away,  joy riding on lunch break in my car from the dealership, hit a pole to avoid hitting a cyclist , which that part I still don't believe!!! No one want to own up to this huge mistake!!! NO ONE called (managers , advisor , receptionist technicians etc) when the accident happen up until today! I didn’t receive any phone calls, any apologies , any police reports, absolutely nothing. Everybody is hiding behind their desk passing this issue to all the wrong people!!! I was promised a call from the General Manager,  it NEVER happened. The only thing I was told is that they would fix my car and that I had to take it back , and if I didn't it would be between myself and the finance company !!! This is absurd !! Who does business like this! 
PS: DO NOT PURCHASE A CAR FROM RICK SANCHEZ!!!!!!!!

11,"October 16, 2018","Let me tell you about my experience with Central Houston Cadillac.  The best way to explain it is this dealership specially the Sales Manage Justin and my Sales Person Xavier knock this deal out of the park by a long shot.  I was working on a New Escalade Demo at another dealer trading in my 2017 Corvette Grand Sport. This dealer was giving me less money and giving me a demo vehicle with 4,000 miles on it. I called Central Houston Cadillac and spoke to Justin and I was upfront and told him the deal I was getting and he beat it right on the phone. So I drove to his dealer to look at the Escalade he was selling me.  His Escalade only had 2,000 miles but the problem I run into was it was Silver and I was looking for Grey. Another Cadillac Dealer I spoke to has the Grey I’m looking for so I walked back to my car to go to the other dealer and that’s when they stop me and asked what will it take to make this deal happen. I said the color but they didn’t have the color I’m looking for. So right there and then I was told not a problem will get you a brand new Escalade no miles and to even sweeten the deal, they didn’t have the truck and they had to do a dealer trade 200 miles away. Just to make this sale.  I came here for a 2018 Demo Escalade with 2K miles and I ended up getting a brand new truck and not to mention I got bumped up to the Luxury Trim Package vs. I was buying a Base model.  Just to prove how good this dealer was is while I was waiting for my New Escalade to come in I get a call from the other 2 Cadillac Dealers on the status of my deal. I took a picture of my contract numbers and sent it to both them.  This are the same 2 dealers that said I can’t get the upgraded trim level and I can’t get a Brand New Escalade it had to be a Demo with Miles. After seeing what Central Houston have done for me this 2 Dealers text back saying we can match that deal and give you a Brand New Escalade too for the same price. What upsets me is I was already at that 2 Dealership working a deal and they gave me the round around. I told them from the beginning I know what I’m looking for and I know what numbers I need to be and they didn’t listen. I also make my living in the Sales world so I know everyone needs to make money to pay the lights but there’s a limit on how much that is to be taken advantage off. I have bought many cars in my time and met a lot of different sales people. Not everyone is out to get you but my advise is to know what you want and go to a Dealer like Central Houston Cadillac and ask for Xavier I promise you his as honest as they come. ",5.0
12,"October 02, 2018","I picked up my vehicle today from  Central Houston Cadillac after having it there for 12 days (September 21-October 2). I was told on two occasions that they were waiting on a part. I was also told that they were backed up. 

Today after being extremely patient I finally received my vehicle. The vehicle showed 99% on the oil change. According to my odometer my vehicle was driven for 30 miles from the date I dropped it off for service to the time I received it back. That does not seem normal for a test drive.

I also noticed that the alignment was not on point. The Lane assist did not react when I drifted into another Lane. 

To make things worse my driver alert package seems to have been disconnected. My seat does not vibrate to alert you of a potential collision. Normally when pulling into my garage the seat will vibrate if I am close to the wall. Instead of vibration from the seat I heard a beeping sound. It appears that the wrong seat was ordered and placed in my vehicle. 

The service rep had the nerve to ask me for a positive review and said that we need them. He texted that if my review was not positive to please not comment at all...really?!?!

The service department had my vehicle for 12 days and it was returned incomplete. This issue needs to be addressed immediately. If my vehicle is to be held I need a vehicle similar to the one that I own. Please fix this issue.",1.0
13,"October 01, 2018","This place is a DUMP! 
 It is no better than a side of the road used car dealership. they have a very unprofessional staff and the entire building is old and needs updating. I bought a Platinum Cadillac Escalade from them and needed service on my vehicle. I called to verify my appointment and they told me that they didn't have me in the system. I had to reschedule my appointment and finally got my vehicle in. My vehicle SAT FOR 4 DAYS BEFORE IT WAS EVEN LOOKED AT!

I am still waiting for my Escalade today 11 days later! The service consultant (Chirs and Junior) wont return my calls and does a terrible job keeping me updated. 

I advice that you stay away from this place and take your business elsewhere.

14,"August 20, 2018","Made appointment with dealer to see Certified Pre-Owned car advertised on Cars.com and other places. After test driving, the dealer increased advertised price by $4000.00 to cover CPO.

Very deceptive.",1.0
15,"July 23, 2018","I took my 2014 CTS (29,800 miles) in for an oil change and a warranty issue, which by the way was my first time ever visiting this dealership. From the time I stepped out of my vehicle the service guy asked what was I in for I told him then he walks away. As we waited another guy approached us and we explained why we were there. He took our key, and we then had to ask him where was the waiting area. Once our car was ready, a service guy hands me my paper work and asked me to sign without going over what was done or what was needed. So I asked him about the warranty issue in regards to the exterior window trims which were fading and peeling. He then tells us that they can't honor the bumper to bumper warranty because we didn't buy the vehicle from Central Cadillac. I knew that wasn't right, so I spoke with  Manager Mike Watson. The manager tells me that I had applied some try of chemical that made it fade and peel, so they can't honor the manufacture warranty. I knew he wasn't right since I never did such a thing. I Asked the manager for Cadillac's customer service number and he gave me the wrong number which was for Cadillac, but not Cadillac's customer service number. Cadillac Customer service advised me to take it to another dealership, because my car still has bumper to bumper warranty the should cover the trim work. Central Cadillac's Crystal Briggs called and said that there service guys were wrong at how the handled the situation and that they will address this with there guys. She also told my wife that the trim was not covered under the bumper to bumper warranty. I took it to Ron Carter Cadillac as of today and they are honoring the warranty (which is still good until October 2018) as a reputable and highly regarded Cadillac dealership should without all the misinformed crap from upper management or bad customer service.

16,"May 30, 2018","Purchased a used luxury car from this dealership with a paid off trade and between agreement on price all was changed during finance to hijack my trade in as to steal it. No paperwork given the day of sale,no plates for two months,no recourse offered in regards to numerous problems with the car,the useless 5300$ warranty and the extreme price changes between sales and finance. Liars,frauds,thieves, and extremely rude and arrogant.  Worst transaction I have ever had!

18,"March 20, 2018","So I’m looking for a escalde. They have a advertised price on autotrader for $60,595. I told the salesman, please confirm the price prior to making a 5 hour drive. As I am going to trade in my work truck. And I offer to give a deposit prior to driving to Houston as it won’t matter due to I won’t be needed financing for the vehicle. They call and tell me I am not a serious buyer. The worst is that Bill the salesman starts stating that are the best selling dealership and that they don’t need my petty business because no one complains about their prices. It’s not like I am asking them to do something impossible. I am only asking to acknowledge the price THEY advertised. As a owner of a Range Rover, an E550, and a grand turismo.

To Whom It May Concerned! 
My name is Professor Tony Hilliard and I want to let the owners and managers know that your level of customer service is PHENOMENOL! Rashid Floyd and Cornelius Colbert are GREAT! From the time I entered the dealership, EVERYONE treated me like royalty. I have bought a lot of cars and been several dealerships. No other establishment can compare to your level of intelligence, product knowledge, expertise and most importantly- Friendliness. You all are just too cool and I really appreciate all of your help.

21,"February 22, 2018","I went by the dealership after seeing a 2016 Escalade advertised for $66,900. Once we started negotiations the price magically increased to $69,800. I would never do business with a dishonest business such as this!",1.0
22,"February 10, 2018","My experience purchasing this vehicle was very pleasing. Unfortunately, problems appeared. We returned the vehicle to the service department and the nightmare began. Mike Watson, who states he is the service manager, began his series of lies, disrespect and lack of any semblance of customer service. 
After several lengthy stays with the service department, the vehicle was returned to us stating it was fixed.  The initial problem persisted. We called to schedule an appointment to return the vehicle for ""proper"" service and was told, by Mr. Mike, that we should continue to drive the vehicle because it did not present a safety hazard.  He refused to return numerous telephone calls ; therefore GM customer care was contacted to provide assistance.  We subsequently received a loner car. The car remains with Central Houston , the latest timeframe exceeds 30 days. Note, this vehicle has been in Central Houston's service department longer than we have had it since the original date of purchase.  Cadillac Customer Service was again contacted and during a three-way conversation he again lied, stating the vehicle was properly prepared and after a test drive, he would deliver the car to us on the 7th. That did not happen. I called Mike several times, no return call. On the afternoon of the 8th, after my third call that day, I spoke with him. He stated he would not return the vehicle until he got ready to do so. He advised me to come get it if I wanted it, uttered profanity and hung up the phone.

I am extremely unhappy with this individual and demand an apology.  I want my vehicle or a loaner with equal equipment as the one I purchased, until they can complete proper repair on mine.  

I should not be experiencing this level of unprofessionalism for selecting this dealership to spend my money with.  He is a very poor representative of Central Houston Cadillac. I WILL continue until I receive the proper service I am warranted.  ",1.0

24,"August 20, 2017","My husband and I were looking for a very specific Cadillac. It showed available online and after speaking with the dealership we went to test drive . Upon arrival we were told they don't have the vehicle yet and to look at some other vehicles that might work for us on the lot. There wasn't anything that fit our specifics so we said we'd come back when they had the one advertised in from their customer who was going to trade it and who still driving it. When we tried to leave we were very aggressively blocked my TWO salesman trying to force us into getting something completely different. Finally after getting away, our salesman called us and said the vehicle was in, we asked when we could test drive it and he said he'd call back.... crickets.

27,"April 25, 2017","I put in an auto application via Lending Tree. I get a call from Samantha claiming to be the internet sales manager. She told me she had an approval on my loan for 34,500. She asked me to come in test drive the car I was looking at and finalize the loan. I made a point on the phone over and over that they had everything complete before I drive an hour up there on a Saturday. 

When I arrived after driving from Galveston to Houston, Aquiles Zarate greets me and states Samantha was with another customer and asked for him to finish up. We test drove the car I was interested in a 2015 SRX, he then tells me he needs me to give him my social for the bank. I do this and then find out I have no approval and they are running my credit. I never gave them my approval to run my credit. Aquiles then comes back and says the bank wants you to add a co-signer or put money down or trade in my truck. I left at this point as I was so upset about being lied to. 

Aquiles and Samantha, tonight I went to Ron Carter, and got a lease on a 2017 XT5 via GM Finance. Had you asked me and treated me honestly you would have seen I had money to put down.

30,"July 27, 2016","I have given this dealership the rating I have gave, because I have not received the customer service that I had became accustom to.  I have bought several vehicles under the old management and I  had such great customer service, that I had grown accustom to being treated with respect, and as a valued customer.  When you pull up in the dock the Service Department met you at the car, (no more).  Now I have to get out  of the car and find (find)!!! someone to assist me.  The Service Manager told me that he does not know anything about Cadillac he only knows how to be a Service Manager.  I ask for a loner car and I was asked ""where do you work"", I said ""what difference does that make"", he said ""because we can give you a ride back to work"".  (No), I am under warranty and I told them before arriving I needed a loner car.  I expect to receive the same customer service that's offered to others.  After speaking to the  Dealership Manager I was told that the Service Manager would be the one to assist me further.  The Service Rept. had a very bad attitude.  He screamed at me ""sign here, here and here"".  I reached for the pen and I was told ""I snatched the pen out of his hand"".  I told him he had a very bad attitude he said ""you have a bad attitude"".  I thought he was going to STRIKE ME.  I I know things change when you get new management, but customer service should never change.  I am very disappointed in this dealership and several long time customers have expressed the same.

A few days later found a cheaper price from a competitor, asked to see if they were willing to price match. We agreed on terms via text message, left work early to go to dealership only to find that the terms and vehicle were completely different then agreed upon. The price was higher and model was lower. The entire time I was in the dealership and communicating via text, they were using deceptive sales tactics.

So I called the front desk and asked for the new car sales manager.The called was transferred  but the manager did not know that I could here them talking between he and the salesman about the referral and was telling him if I did not tell him in the beginning, he shouldn't be rewarded. After I said hello they realized I was on the phone and I explained everything the manager said that he would call me back. I still have not received any call. I will not purchase another car from them or recommend them to anyone. If you told me the truth in the beginning I can accept that but to lie to me is deceiving, therefore I an passing my experience to social media networks to be aware.",2.8
34,"June 26, 2015","I purchased 2012 in 2011, I have same concern with acceleration and throttle sounding exhausted. It seems as though my car is straining. I have had my car to dealership to see if they could duplicate my concern.
I was told could not duplicate and was told by Service Manager, they could no longer extend me a loaner because its nothing wrong with my vehicle.
It was May when they told me this, I have since enrolled in triple AAA, to have my car towed in the event my nightmare come true, that there is this problem with my vehicle and at this point I can't receive any service.
I feel the dealership feels that I pay my monthly note, and that I look forward to jumping in there loaner. 
The service Manager made the statement that *I put more miles on there loaner cars than my car). I do work for a living and I teach every other week a class out of town.
I have exhausted all measures of being accomodating with that dealership.
Maybe I am reluctant because originally when I purchased my first vehicle from Stewart it was a 2010, again I noticed problems brought it back to dealership to duplucate, could not duplicate.
I left dealership approximately 7 miles from dealership my transmission blew, the car shut off on me on the freeway at 5:00 rush hour traffic, almost crushed by two Eighteen wheelers.
This leaves me with a very bad taste for their non-duplucation song and dance. So, I am I am leary about their ability to fix the problem, Yes I am.
Their concern is the loaner my concern is the vehicle I pay a monthly note on every month to operate correctly.

35,"September 04, 2014","I've tried to buy a new car several times from Stewart and each time I walk out astonished at the blatant shenanigans they pull to inflate the negotiated price.  Not the usual valueless dealer add-ons, I'm talking about shifting numbers in the contract to wildly inflate the negotiated price.  Only after I told them I was leaving to call Cadillac corporate did they say they'd try to meet the price they advertised.  If this was once or twice, I'd write it off to a silly mistake.  But they've tried to pull the same flim-flams every single time.  Looking through reviews, it's apparent that ""unethical"" is how Stewart deals with their customers.  

I've bought dozens of cars in my lifetime and have never been treated like this by any other dealership.  Don't waste your time selecting a car and negotiating a deal.  That number will mean absolutely nothing when you see your contract.  Stick with one of the reputable Cadillac dealers in Houston.  Stewart is not on that list.  ",1.4

Upon entering the dealership everyone was so nice and friendly. since I have previously bought from this dealer I expected nothing less. Upon meeting my sale rep, he put me at ease and started the process. After test drive and being informed about the different functions of the car, all the other aspects of the car was ready for me to decide on. Was a little disappointed about the trade in value for my car because I kept the miles low. Going into a dealership and driving away in a new car under 3 hours was outstanding.",4.8

42,"May 07, 2014","I had been thinking about trading my 2010 SRX because I wanted a back-up camera.  I thought about having one installed but was afraid of having someone other than Cadillac install it.  When I brought my car in for the 50k mile maintenance the Service consultant was so happy and friendly that when he suggested that I speak with a sales person before they start the maintenance, I agreed.  When I saw the smiling face of my first salesperson, I felt relaxed enough to discuss trading up.  

I am a retiree and am very cautious about my spending.  I told the salesperson that I wanted a SRX with the same package as the 2010 but with a back-up camera.  The sales person explained that because the 2014 is equipped with The Que, the backup-up camera could be installed in the dash screen rather than the rear view mirror.  I am very happy with my new SRX and very pleased that the Service Consultant called the Sales person who convinced that I could get what I wanted at the price I wanted to pay.",5.0

Me and my wife went to Stewart Cadillac & met with salesman Michael Williams, who was by far the best sales person I have ever dealt with. I have purchased new vehicles in the past from several different manufactures; however Michael Williams was very courteous, respectful, and honest and really took the time to explain all the details of the new 2013 SRX Cadillac including all the wonderful features that the SRX has.  The General Manager Mr. Massey was very professional, courteous, friendly and helpful. I had spoken to him on the phone the week prior to coming to Stewart Cadillac. Mr. Massey did a wonderful job of convincing me that he really wanted to sell me a Cadillac and focused on the objective rather than on high-pressure sale talk. This was the most exciting and wonderful experience I have ever had with regards to buying a new car. There were not any surprising Sales Tricks or intimidating techniques. Mr. Michael Williams and General Manager Mr. Massey helped me follow my inclinations.  I left there that day with a brand new 2013 SRX. I would happily recommend Stewart Cadillac to anyone who is looking to buy a new car.  ",5.0
