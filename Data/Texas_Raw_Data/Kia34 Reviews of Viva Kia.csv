10,"January 08, 2020","From calling and having Salema get me in because I needed my car  and to the incredible service from Caesar, I am amazed.  Caesar kept following up with me and explaining the services I needed.  He double checked before determining I needed a new battery.  He also took care of the total point  check up and installing new windshield wipers. He also order a new fob, because my spare was lost.   I have owned a dealer ship and I really think Viva KIA is right on being professional and giving personal service.  ",5.0

18,"January 15, 2019",Since I purchased my Optima at Viva Kia on Montana I have always taken my vehicle to be serviced there. I always make an appointment but this time I did not but they were still able to take me and fit me into their booked day.

21,"August 10, 2018","I had a simple service appointment at 0800 because Kia issued a safety recall to reprogram my computer so that my power sliding doors will be more sensitive to obstructions. When I arrived, I introduced myself and let them know I had an appointment. I worked with Benjamin. B, he displayed wonderful customer service, he checked up on me periodically  to make sure I was okay, he informed me of the type of work the mechanic will be preforming. And at the end of the process, the work was completed. Benjamin took the time to explain the paperwork. I felt comfortable with the service I received on this day. And I also appreciate the work that was done by the auto mechanic. (It was my first time getting my vehicle serviced at this location.) ",4.6

33,"February 09, 2016","This dealership has absolutely no integrity.  I put 400 dollars down to hold a vehicle.  Manager and sales person assured our money would be safe.  The day we went in to sign paperwork, we were notified the car had been sold.  On top of that we are yet to get our money back.  These people are dishonest and don't care about their customers.   I have been receiving emails from the dealer sending me notices on other cars.  No shame whatsoever.   I am disgusted.  I can't believe this happened to us.  Way to live up to the stereotype of the crooked car salesman.  I am reviewing in as many sites as I can to get the word out.  If they were dishonest about this, what else can the u be dishonest about.  Take your business else where !",1.0
