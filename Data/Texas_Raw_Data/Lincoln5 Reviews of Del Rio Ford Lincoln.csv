0,"July 30, 2017","Under no circumstances should this dealer be trusted. Saw a great price for a used vehicle, called to verify it was at the dealer and already over the phone in my first interaction with the sales person wanting to find out if it was a ""done deal"" even though I hadn't physically seen the car or driven it. Appointment time was set and when I arrive, the sales person is nowhere to be seen and other sales people tell me he is ""at lunch"" despite knowing they had an appointment. We wait 20 minutes and when I inform him he was late for his appointment, he laughs as if its a joke. Fast forward past the vehicle inspection (the car was incredibly dirty despite being at the dealer for over 2 months now), I am informed that they can't honor the price that was advertised on their website because that is no longer what was being listed. Classic bait and switch. Expecting this, since I had informed the sales person of the discrepancies on various websites, the website ads disappeared but not before screen shots and links were saved. I produced printouts of everything I saw, gave them direct links (that no longer worked) and best of all, Google had cached the websites with the low price clearly displayed on the vehicle in question, complete with the exact description and VIN number. The sales person also handed me a newspaper and said that that was the ad they ran just before the car went to another dealer (before returning when I requested it). He said it was from a week prior. When I flipped the paper over, the very top of the newspaper clearly displayed the date from the day before my visit, not the week before.

The manager showed a clear lack of understanding on how the internet works and tried to blame google for changing the price. At one point, he even tries to say that this price never appeared on their website and that it has to be faked by google. Seriously. I wish I could've made that up. Eventually, they caved and were willing to sell the car at the price advertised but immediately balked when I said I would pay in cash and not finance. It didn't matter anyway because I did not plan to do business with them. It was very obvious from the start when the sales person was ""at lunch"" that this dealer is sleazy. They could not deal with the fact that I was so prepared for their obvious tricks. If you are an informed buyer, go somewhere else. These people are not honest at all. As soon as they realized their lies and deceptions weren't going to work, the sales person's smug attitude quickly disappeared.",1.0
1,"October 11, 2016","What good is an appointment if you still wait and wait.  No parts in stock for normal replacement part.  ""Life time warranty"" that is not honored.  And maybe worst of all, nobody will answer the main phone line!  In addition, had to pry lug nuts off to fix a flat because they were so over torqued to the point that even with an air driver wrench, they could not be removed!  Had to buy new lug nuts.  Did they take any responsibility?  Repeated messages to Service Manager have yet to be returned",1.0
2,"October 01, 2015",I purchased a used vehicle at this dealership and the extended warranty.  The dealer sold me the warranty with the notion that I could refund it at anytime.  I returned to the dealership months later to fill out paperwork to get a refund on the extended warranty.  I was told it would take 6-8 weeks to receive the refund.  9 weeks go by and no refund yet.  I go back in to the dealership and they say they didn't file anything.  Then I file more paperwork and I keep calling and just more excuses.  Apparently dealerships like this one just like to eat your money instead of being fair.,1.0
3,"May 15, 2013","Horrible. New to town took truck into have a/c serviced. Mario says ""no problem it has vacuum leak and will be done in couple hours"". Two days later and a thousand dollars I go get my truck to find they didn't use fender guards and rubbed there belt on it down to metal and also drove truck into something putting scratches down the side. When brought the problem up to Mario he says ""oh that was already like that"". Horrible dealership.",1.0
